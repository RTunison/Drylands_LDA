J	Liu, SS; Zhou, XC				Liu, Shanshan; Zhou, Xuecheng			The PMIP4 simulated dryland aridity changes during the Last Interglacial	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The dryland is one of the most important land ecosystems on the planet, and its changes are closely bound up with one-third of the world's population. Investigating dryland climate change during the Last Interglacial (LIG; & SIM;127 ka ago) can advance our knowledge of dryland climate behaviors in an orbitally-induced warmer-than-present scenario. Based on the multiple model outputs from the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase 4, we suggest that the dryland areas during the LIG are 37% wetter than that during the preindustrial period as measured by the aridity index (AI), and 37% of the preindustrial drylands correspondingly convert to wetter subtypes. Spatially, there are hemispheric differences with drylands wetting and contracting in the Northern Hemisphere but desiccating and expanding in the Southern Hemisphere. Further diagnosis indicates that the altered precipitation is the dominant contributor to more than 72% of the AI changes, and the precipitation change is mainly attributed to the orbitally-induced redistribution of incoming insolation and heat. The secondary factor is the relative humidity change, exaggerating the AI changes in the same direction as the precipitation does. The simulation agrees reasonably with reconstructions for most regions, except Australia and southern Africa. The simulated changes in dryland aridity and the mechanism differ from that in future warming scenarios, so we claim that the LIG as a potential analogue for a warmer future does not fully hold for the dryland climate.																			1748-9326					SEP 1	2023	18	9							094056	10.1088/1748-9326/acf725	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/acf725													WOS:001067629100001
J	Dialesandro, JM; Wheeler, SM; Abunnasr, Y				Dialesandro, John M.; Wheeler, Stephen M.; Abunnasr, Yaser			Urban heat island behaviors in dryland regions	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS												Urban heat island (UHI) characteristics and mitigation strategies for dryland cities differ from those for wetter urban regions. Whereas the latter typically see daytime surface UHIs, the rapid heating and cooling of deserts surrounding arid cities often produces daytime 'urban cool islands' and nighttime UHIs. Degrees of aridness, extent of vegetation, elevation, latitude, humidity, topography, and typical building types are likely to influence dryland UHI dynamics. This study analyzes variations in thermal effects at multiple scales for 10 dryland urban regions representing varied geographies worldwide with an aim to establish a broader understanding of the spectrum of UHI patterns in dryland cities. We used GIS to assemble daytime and nighttime satellite imagery, determined land surface temperature and vegetation at a 30-meter scale, and analyzed typical neighborhood-scale examples of six land cover types in each region. The 10 regions showed large variation in thermal effects. We found a strong daytime surface UHI in only one. Nighttime heat islands were more pronounced. However, all regions showed strong small-scale variation in temperature, averaging a 12.3 degrees C difference between mean top quintile and bottom-quintile surface temperatures. Samples of urban forest landscapes cooled daytime temperatures an average of 5.6 degrees C compared to metro averages. Irrigated lawn and multistory building land cover samples also had a substantial cooling effect. Xeriscaped landscapes amplified daytime heating. Our results indicate that UHIs for dryland cities are unlikely to be reduced by xeriscape strategies, but that shade-maximizing urban forestry and built form hold promise to reduce heat islands.

The potential changes in dryland areas are of great importance to the environment, but various debates remain as to whether and to what extent drylands are expected to expand. Here we employ a physically-based potential evapotranspiration (E-P) model accounting for vegetation response to climate change to quantify potential changes in dryland areas, on the basis of a commonly used indicator, aridity index (multiyear mean EP over precipitation). Results show that by the end of this century, drylands will expand slightly by similar to 5%, while vegetation productivity will increase by similar to 50%. Elevated CO2 slows down the increase rate of EP that impedes the expansion of drylands, but greatly promotes vegetation growth with increases in both leaf assimilation and canopy foliage. These findings improve our understanding of the potential changes in dryland and their ecological impacts in a warmer climate.

J	Gao, Y; Li, J; Hu, ZL; Shi, Y				Gao, Yu; Li, Jun; Hu, Zhanli; Shi, Yan			Effects of Acetochlor on Wheat Growth Characteristics and Soil Residue in Dryland	GESUNDE PFLANZEN												In this experiment, Jimai 22 was used as test material to investigate the impacts of acetochlor on the growth characteri*stics of dryland wheat and its residue in wheat grain and soil under field conditions. The results showed that acetochlor at a dosage of 750 g hm(-2) could effectively control weeds in wheat fields and benefit the growth of wheat in dryland. The plant height, ear length, number of tillers, aboveground and underground dry weight were heavier compared to the control after the application of acetochlor. From the jointing period to the filling period, the residual amount of acetochlor in the 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm soil layers was gradually reduced in the overall change, and the residual amount of acetochlor in the 0-20 cm soil layer in each growth period was more than the residual that of in the 20-40 cm soil layer. At the time of harvest, the residual amount of acetochlor in wheat grains was lower than the maximum allowable residue limit (MRL) value of acetochlor on wheat recommended by the United States. In addition, the residue of acetochlor in the soil of wheat field was also very small, all of which were lower than 0.02 mg kg(-1). It can be seen that the application of acetochlor is safe for wheat field soil and humans if the wheat is applied once after sowing, at the dosage is 750 g hm(-2).

J	Humphries, M; McCarthy, T				Humphries, Marc; McCarthy, Terence			Chemical sedimentation as a driver of habitat diversity in dryland wetlands	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Freshwater wetlands located in dryland environments are characterised by high evapotranspiration rates and frequent periods of desiccation, which strongly influence the water chemistry and solute budgets of these systems. The transpiration of groundwater, especially by trees, is an important mechanism through which dryland wetlands can lose water. This process can lead to groundwater salinization and the precipitation of substantial quantities of minerals within the soil, the accumulation of which can have profound consequences for wetland structure and function. This paper aims to bring together current knowledge on the processes that result in solute accumulation and chemical sedimentation which assist in maintaining freshwater conditions in many seasonal dryland wetlands. Examples from central and southern Africa, Australia and South America are presented to illustrate the geomorphically diverse settings under which chemical sedimentation can occur, and the importance of these processes for the resilience and longevity of dryland wetlands. We show that the localised development of saline groundwater and subsurface precipitation of minerals within soils can play a key role in creating and maintaining the habitat diversity of dryland wetlands. Wetland vegetation localises the accumulation of deleterious constituents, thereby preventing widespread salinization and playa-lake formation, and thus ensuring that the bulk of the surface water remains fresh. Although such processes remain widely understudied, we suggest that chemical sedimentation could be a common phenomenon in many dryland wetlands and have important implications for the future management of these ecosystems.

Most studies on biocrust functions to date have focused on biocrust cover and development, largely in non-saline soils, and we know very little about the importance of biocrust diversity for maintaining multifunctionality in saline dryland soils. We assessed the direct and indirect linkages between biocrust richness, soil texture and salinity and soil multifunctionality by measuring 13 variables characterizing soil biological, nutrient and hydrological functions across 32 plots in a salinized dryland in northeastern Iran. We assessed the species richness of biocrust patches and characterized soil functions in bare soils. Overall, biocrust species richness declined with soil clay content and soil salinity, whereas soil salinity increased with soil clay content. Structural equation modeling showed a strong positive association between biocrust species richness and all measured dryland soil functions (soil biological, nutrient, and hydrological functions), but soil hydrological function declined with soil salinity. Overall, dryland soil multifunctionality was positively associated with biocrust species richness but negatively associated with soil clay content. Biocrust species richness likely enhances soil multifunctionality via the distinct roles of species and biocrust functional groups in providing carbon and nutrient inputs, creating favourable microsites, enhancing infiltration, and facilitating soil microbial colonization in saline dryland soils. Overall, our findings highlight a key role for biocrust diversity in facilitating and maintaining soil multifunctionality in drylands affected by soil salinity.

Here, we surveyed the soil microbial communities in neighboring pairs of dryland and paddy fields in the black soils of northeastern China. Soil moisture, mean weight diameter of aggregates, fluorescence index and biological index of dissolvable organic matter, total anion concentration, and prokaryotic community a-diversity were higher in paddy soils than in dryland soils, while soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (SHC), dissolvable total nitrogen, and fungal com-munity a-diversity were lower in paddy soils than in dryland soils. Moreover, soil moisture (P < 0.01) and SHC (P < 0.05) had significantly positive correlations with the a-diversity of prokaryotic and fungal communities, respectively. The co-occurrence network complexity of microbial communities was lower in paddy fields than in dryland fields, while the co-occurrence network tightness and cooperation of microbial communities were higher in paddy fields than in dryland fields, which may help paddy microbiome resist environmental disturbances. Taken together, both dryland and paddy fields had their own advantages in evaluating soil biological health from microbial community diversity and network stability. Additionally, the differential groups of CH4 production, S cycle, and Fe cycle (e.g., Bathyarchaeota, Bacteroidetes, and Geobacter) increased, while those of environmental remediation and biological control (e.g., Blastococcus and Roseiflexus) decreased after the change from dryland to paddy fields. Further combined with metagenomic analysis, the functions of CH4 production, CO2 fixation, N fixation, and sulfur reduction were enhanced in paddy soils, while those of CH4 oxidation, nitrification, and N2O production were reduced. In conclusion, the ecological functioning of the differential groups may lead to the increase of CH4 emission and CO2 fixation, and the decrease of N2O emission in paddy fields of black soil, even in non-flooding period.					wang, shaojie/HHY-8634-2022	wang, shaojie/0000-0002-6818-3136; Chang, Jingjing/0000-0001-5031-7581													0167-8809	1873-2305				SEP 1	2023	353								108562	10.1016/j.agee.2023.108562	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2023.108562		MAY 2023											WOS:001053903200001

This paper details the first African meeting of the G-DEP. Consultative meeting reviewed preceding dryland ecosystems case studies, identified vulnerable arid and semi-arid regions, and proposed sustainable solutions to problems. It also identified the successes and failures of previous attempts to improve vulnerable ecosystems and ultimately formed an action plan to improve these attempts. Climate, ecosystems, and livelihoods for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Great Green Wall Initiative (GGWI) for Sahara and Sahel, and China-Africa cooperation on science, technology, and innovation are three extra main sections concerned of the meeting. Separately, more specific topics as the complicated relationship between these natural processes and human activity, including pastoralism, soil restoration, and vegetation regenerate techniques, were fully discussed. Consultative meeting also identified the positive effects international collaboration can have on dryland regions, specifically in the capacity of sharing information, technology, and innovation on purpose to develop a joint proposal for long-term research programs in African arid and semi-arid areas. Moreover, meetings that review the progress made on ecosystem management for the sustainable livelihoods in Africa, identification of priority areas, and the development and implementation of ecosystem programs for proper research and collaboration in African arid and semi-arid zones, have been proposed as strategic recommendations to enhance the global partnership for sustainable development. Furthermore, as the outcomes of the workshop, there are three steps proposed to handle African dryland climate changes, several aspects suggested to solve current dilemmas of the GGWI, and a series of actions recommended for G-DEP related activities in Africa.

This study presents an analysis of the responses of dryland vegetation to the worst extreme drought over the past two decades in Australia, using multi-source spaceborne SIF derived from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). Vegetation functioning was substantially constrained by this extreme event, especially in the interior of Australia, in which there was hardly seasonal growth detected by neither satellite-based observations nor tower-based flux measurements. At a 16-day interval, both SIF and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) can timely capture the reduction at the onset of drought over dryland ecosystems. The results demonstrate that satellite-observed SIF has the potential for characterizing and monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of drought over water-limited ecosystems, despite coarse spatial resolution coupled with high-retrieval noise as compared with EVI. Furthermore, our study highlights that SIF retrieved from TROPOMI featuring substantially enhanced spatiotemporal resolution has the promising capability for accurately tracking the drought-induced variation of heterogeneous dryland vegetation.					wang, qianfeng/AAY-6922-2020; Leng, Song/GNH-2574-2022; Cleverly, Jamie Rose/L-2134-2016; Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021; Huete, Alfredo/C-1294-2008	wang, qianfeng/0000-0002-8460-6821; Leng, Song/0000-0001-6724-9597; Cleverly, Jamie Rose/0000-0002-2731-7150; Gao, Sicong/0000-0001-6429-1917; Huete, Alfredo/0000-0003-2809-2376; Zhang, Rongrong/0000-0002-1089-1869														2072-4292				APR	2022	14	7							1581	10.3390/rs14071581	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14071581													WOS:000781465200001

Soil fertility constraints and management to increase crop yields in the dryland farming systems of Aceh, Indonesia	SOIL RESEARCH												In Aceh, Indonesia, low dryland crop yields entrench rural poverty. The lack of soil fertility information hinders the development of soil management programs to assist farmers to increase crop yield. This study identified soil-based constraints to production and management options to increase crop yield. We analysed 254 soil samples from 127 dryland cropping sites across Pidie, Bireuen, Aceh Besar and Aceh Barat districts for pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), base saturation (BS) and cation exchange capacity (CEC). The dominant soils were Entisols, Inceptisols and Ultisols, with some Andisols and Mollisols. Overall, the CEC range was 10-60 cmol(+) kg(-1)and available P was 0.5-702 mg kg(-1) but most had poor fertility: SOC < 20.0 g kg(-1), total N < 2.0 g kg(-1), low basic cations and BS < 40%. The Ultisols and some Entisols and Inceptisols were acidic, with aluminium saturation >20% and available P < 6.5 mg kg(-1). To sustainably increase crop yield, we concluded that these soils need lime where acidic, fertilisers for nutrients and stable carbon-rich amendments for system stability. This dataset will guide future agricultural research and development programs in Aceh to improve farmer practices and food security.

J	Burrow, H				Burrow, Heather			Strategies for Increasing Beef Cattle Production under Dryland Farming Systems	WARTAZOA-BULETIN ILMU PETERNAKAN DAN KESEHATAN HEWAN INDONESIA												Integrated cattle and dryland farming systems in Indonesia use a range of crop residues and by products to feed cattle through intensive and extensive production systems. Intensive systems use stalls to house cattle and cut and carry feeding systems, primarily for fattening cattle. Under extensive systems, cattle are free-grazing,and the systems apply only where greater land areas exist and they are used for breeding and fattening cattle. This paper therefore specifically focuses on the opportunities that exist to improve beef production in dryland farming systems in Indonesia. The best strategies for smallholder farmers in Indonesia to improve beef production require farmers to focus on profitability and use proven management strategies, including a) using adapted cattle breeds resistant/tolerant to environmental stressor, b) understanding the market preference; c) managing cattle breeding herds based on rainfall patterns, d) keeping good records on all aspects of breeding and fattening activities and e) adjusting stocking rates in extensive system to match the carrying capacity of the land.

Recent investigations suggest that the absorption of atmospheric carbon by dryland farm soil is probably related to autotrophic carbon fixation in the soil. However, little evidence for this has been presented. Therefore, we hypothesized that autotrophic microbes employing carbon fixation pathways exist in dryland farm soil. To verify this hypothesis, metagenomic sequencing and analysis methods were used to identify autotrophic microbes harboring genes of carbon fixation pathways in the soil of six typical farmlands in a dryland area. The results showed that autotrophic microbes harboring genes of six carbon fixation pathways existed at each of the six sites, and their average relative abundance at our study sites was 1.68%. The dominant phyla of autotrophic microbes in dryland farm soil were Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Among the determined carbon fixation pathways, the reductive citrate cycle was the most representative pathway with the highest relative abundance. Moreover, the composition of these autotrophic microbes was correlated with total phosphorus and soil pH, while the composition of carbon fixation genes was not correlated with soil properties. Overall, the present study highlights that dryland farm soil may fix atmospheric carbon through autotrophic microbial pathways, which provides a new reference for exploring the absorption of atmospheric carbon in farmland soils of drylands.

Resistance, Resilience, and Recovery of Dryland Soil Bacterial Communities Across Multiple Disturbances	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Dryland ecosystems are sensitive to perturbations and generally slow to recover post disturbance. The microorganisms residing in dryland soils are especially important as they contribute to soil structure and nutrient cycling. Disturbance can have particularly strong effects on dryland soil structure and function, yet the natural resistance and recovery of the microbial components of dryland soils has not been well documented. In this study, the recovery of surface soil bacterial communities from multiple physical and environmental disturbances is assessed. Samples were collected from three field sites in the vicinity of Moab, UT, United States, 6 to 7 years after physical and climate disturbance manipulations had been terminated, allowing for the assessment of community recovery. Additionally, samples were collected in a transect that included three habitat patches: the canopy zone soils under the dominant shrubs, the interspace soils that are colonized by biological soil crusts, and edge soils at the plot borders. Field site and habitat patch were significant factors structuring the bacterial communities, illustrating that sites and habitats harbored unique soil microbiomes. Across the different sites and disturbance treatments, there was evidence of significant bacterial community recovery, as bacterial biomass and diversity were not significantly different than control plots. There was, however, a small number of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence variants that distinguished particular treatments, suggesting that legacy effects of the disturbances still remained. Taken together, these data suggest that dryland bacterial communities may possess a previously unappreciated potential to recover within years of the original disturbance.

The vulnerability assessment is a useful and effective tool for determining the impact of climate change on dryland farmers towards adaptation. The factors assessment plays an important role in designing and implementing policy research on a local scale in developing nations. The study aims to calculate the vulnerability level and factors affecting it in the dryland community in Southern India using Vulnerability index calculation and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The primary data were collected with a structured questionnaire from randomly selected 200 farming households from ten villages. This study introduced new contextual variables in the vulnerability assessment and compared different ML techniques to analyse the vulnerability factors. The study showed that the dryland community is moderately vulnerable because of its higher adaptive capacity. The results of the ML techniques showed that the factors "Involvement in the awareness programmes, income sources for food, farm size, and education status of the dryland farmers" had a significant impact on the vulnerability level of the community. Potential coping strategies were identified to reduce the vulnerability level of the dryland farmers. The present study showed a pathway that can help the policy research and development plan for the sustainable livelihood of dryland farmers at a micro-level in the climate-changing scenario.

J	Gandhi, P; Liu, LLY; Silber, M				Gandhi, Punit; Liu, Lily; Silber, Mary			A Pulsed-Precipitation Model of Dryland Vegetation Pattern Formation	SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS												We develop a model for investigating the impact of rainstorm variability on the formation of banded vegetation patterns in dryland ecosystems. Water input, during rare rainstorms, is modeled as an instantaneous kick to the soil water. The redistribution, from surface water to soil moisture, accounts for the impact of vegetation on infiltration rate and downslope overland flow speed. These two positive feedbacks between water and biomass distributions act on the fast timescales of rain storms. During dry periods, a classic reaction-diffusion framework is used for the slow processes associated with soil water and biomass. This pulsed-precipitation model predicts that the preferred spacing of the vegetation bands is determined by the characteristic distance that a storm pulse of water travels overland before infiltrating into the soil. In this way, the vegetation pattern is determined by the fast ecohydrological processes and may be attuned with its dryland precipitation pattern. We demonstrate how this modeling framework, suited for stochastic rain inputs, can be used to investigate possible collapse of a dryland pattern-forming ecosystem under different precipitation patterns with identical low annual mean. Model simulations suggest, for instance, that shorter rainy seasons and greater variability in storm depth may both hasten ecosystem collapse.																			1536-0040						2023	22	2					657	693		10.1137/22M1469572	http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/22M1469572													WOS:001031745100005

However, reduced classification accuracy of dryland cities often occurs in global land cover data. Although many advanced classification techniques (i.e., convolutional neural networks (CNN)) have been intensively applied to classify urban land cover because of their excellent performance, specific classification models focusing on typical dryland cities are still scarce. This is mainly attributed to the similar features between urban and non-urban areas, as well as the insufficient training samples in this specific region. To fill this gap, this study trained a CNN model to improve the urban land classification accuracy for seven dryland cities based on rigorous training sample selection. The assessment showed that our proposed model performed with higher overall accuracy (92.63%) than several emerging land cover products, including Esri 2020 Land Cover (75.55%), GlobeLand30 (73.24%), GLC_FCS30-2020 (69.68%), ESA WorldCover2020 (64.38%), and FROM-GLC 2017v1 (61.13%). In addition, the classification accuracy of the dominant land types in the CNN-classified data exceeded the selected products. This encouraging finding demonstrates that our proposed architecture is a promising solution for improving dryland urban land classification accuracy and compensating the deficiency of large-scale land cover mapping.

Detecting inundation thresholds for dryland wetland vulnerability	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES												Dryland wetlands receiving periodical floods are of key importance for ecological resilience. The inundation regime (i.e., frequency, duration, depth, and timing of inundation), is one of the major factors that determine the suitability of local conditions for specific wetland species. During droughts, inundation conditions can reach a threshold after which wetland vegetation could transition to dryland vegetation. This study analyses the response of vegetation to hydrologic variability in an arid wetland in Australia over a period of 22 years (including the Millennium drought) in order to identify inundation thresholds for transitions. We use numerical modelling, field observations and remote sensing data to relate continuous detailed simulations of the inundation regime with the response of patches of Common reed, Water couch and River red gum, three key vegetation associations in the study site. We focus in patches that were affected by the drought and presented dryland vegetation invasion as well as reference patches that remained healthy throughout the drought. On each patch, we compare annual and inter-annual simulated inundation regimes to the minimum inundation conditions that can support the specific vegetation, and we compute the percentage area of the patch that verifies minimum inundation for each year. We define this area percentage as minimum inundation index. This index is analysed in conjunction with Landsat derived information on green vegetation coverage (green Seasonal Fractional Cover) for the selected patches. We found that the minimum inundation index and inter annual frequency are able to describe the vegetation dynamics of the patches, which can be characterised by two distinct response modes that depend on a threshold value of the minimum inundation index. Inundation below the threshold noticeably leads to degraded vegetation, but the vegetation can recover quickly if this threshold is later maintained for one or two years. Values below the threshold for more extended periods (drought) result in a gradual decrease of wetland vegetation to almost complete disappearance after four years and subsequent dryland vegetation invasion.

Dryland farming improvement by considering the relation between rainfall variability and crop yield	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY												About 40% of the global cultivable land practices dryland farming. An improvement of dryland farming is imperative to ensure food security for expanding populations in the developing world. This paper presents a method to assess the impact of precipitation variability on the annual yield of dryland farmed crops. All probable periods of precipitation in three dryland farming seasons (autumn, winter, and spring) are considered. The effect of each period of precipitation on the annual yield of dryland farmed crops is assessed, and the most effective period of precipitation on the annual yield of each crop is identified. Subsequently, annual yield versus effective precipitation regressions for each crop are developed. The annual crop yields are calculated with annual yield versus effective precipitation regressions and with the probability distribution function method. The presented methodology is illustrated with an application to wheat and barley production in Hamedan Province, Iran. The most effective period of precipitation for predicting the annual yield of dryland farmed wheat and barley in all conditions is March 30-May 7. The predictive skill of the annual yield versus effective precipitation regressions is evaluated and found to yield crop yield estimates that are very similar to those obtained with the probability distribution function method.

Representing a dense network of ponds and reservoirs in a semi-distributed dryland catchment model	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The mismatch between natural water availability and demand in dryland regions is overcome by reservoirs of different sizes with the purpose of storing water. The increase in population in dryland regions and the consequent growth in water demand expanded the construction of small reservoirs, generating in these regions a dense network of reservoirs, which increases the complexity of modeling these hydrological systems. For dryland watersheds modeling with daily time-step, the horizontal connectivity of the reservoir network needs careful representation in order to achieve acceptable model performance, including cumulative effects of reservoirs. However, the horizontal connectivity of reservoir networks is often less investigated in large-scale catchment models. This work presents an innovative way of implementing the dense-reservoir network into the widely used eco-hydrological model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), with detailed representation of large and small reservoirs, and an extensive analysis about the cumulative impact of small reservoirs on the horizontal hydrological connectivity for large-scale dryland catchments. A two-fold cross-validation was used against streamflow at a catchment outlet and against in-catchment reservoir water levels. The model daily performance was acceptable despite the input data uncertainty, with good reliability for peak flow in wet years, for nonflow periods and for the rising limb of the hydrograph. The efforts in the parameterization of reservoirs and aggregation of ponds allowed a better analysis of the hydrological processes and their impacts in the catchment. The results showed that small reservoirs decreased the streamflow, but had a low impact on catchment retention and water losses, with 2% of water retention in wet years. However, the water retention reached 9% in dry years, which may worsen periods of water scarcity in the large reservoirs. The spatial representation of small reservoirs for a high-density network in the SWAT model and the results of the cumulative impact of small reservoirs may be relevant for a better understanding of hydrology in dryland catchments, and can be applied to catchments in similar climatic and socio-economic environments.

However, how water and energy availability influence dryland plant diversity along the aridity gradient in water-limited regions is still lacking. Hence, quantitative analyses were conducted to evaluate the relative importance of water and energy to dryland plant diversity based on 1039 quadrats across 184 sites in China's dryland. The results indicated that water availability and the water-energy interaction were pivotal to plant diversity in the entire dryland and consistent with the predictions of the water-energy dynamic hypothesis. The predominance of water limitation on dryland plant diversity showed a weak trend with decreasing aridity, while the effects of energy on plants were found to be significant in mesic regions. Moreover, the responses of different plant lifeforms to water and energy were found to vary along the aridity gradient. In conclusion, the study will enrich the limited knowledge about the effects of water and energy on plant diversity (overall plants and different lifeforms) in the dryland of China along the aridity gradient.

J	Priddy, CL; Clarke, SM				Priddy, Charlotte L.; Clarke, Stuart M.			Spatial variation in the sedimentary architecture of a dryland fluvial system	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Ancient dryland terminal fluvial systems are often recognized within the rock record for having a progressive downstream decrease in the size and amalgamation of channel elements and systematic downstream increase in sheet and overbank elements, alongside the downstream decrease in grain size that is displayed by most fluvial systems. The spatial distribution and downstream trends displayed by the fluvial sediments of the Lower Jurassic Kayenta Formation of south-western USA, have been examined quantitatively. The results indicate many trends that are similar to those of a dryland terminal fluvial system, including; a lack of confinement of the fluvial system, a downstream decrease in channel and sheet element amalgamation and width-to-thickness ratios, a downstream decrease in grain size, albeit very small, and an increase in the percentage of overbank elements downstream. However, the study highlights several downstream relationships that are atypical. While some of these relationships may be the result of external factors inherent in this study, others, including the thicknesses of channel-fill and sheet elements that display no significant relationships to distance downstream, and channel-fill elements that display no significant variation in average grain size with distance downstream, may be a consequence of fluvial interaction with a competing and coeval aeolian system. This work demonstrates the inherent complexity in arid dryland fluvial systems and the downstream architectural and compositional relationships that they depict. Consequently, models for fluvial style may provide only a first-order approximation for downstream trends in dryland systems, because the controlling factors upon these systems are inherently difficult to unravel, and the sedimentary detail is strongly dependent upon external setting and internal complexity. Consequently, a generalized model may not always be applicable to these systems.

In this study, we used the Time Series Segmented Residual Trends (TSS-RESTREND) method to attribute changes in vegetation to CO2, land use, climate change, and climate variability in Chinese and American dryland areas. Our analysis showed that both Chinese and American drylands have undergone a greening trend over the past four decades, with Chinese greening likely linked to climatic warming and humidification of Northwest China. Climate change was the dominant factor driving vegetation change in China, accounting for 48.3%, while CO2 fertilization was the dominant factor in American drylands, accounting for 47.9%. However, land use was the primary factor resulting in desertification in both regions. Regional analysis revealed the importance of understanding the drivers of vegetation change and land degradation in Chinese and American drylands to prevent desertification. These findings highlight the need for sustainable management practices that consider the complex interplay of climate change, land use, and vegetation growth in dryland areas.

The field experiment was performed from 2019 to 2021 in the eastern part of Loess Plateau, China Nitrogen (N) fertilizer application improves winter wheat yield. It was necessary to analyze the nitrogen utilization of different varieties and screen varieties with high yield and high nitrogen utilization. Six dryland wheat varieties YH-20410, YH-618, YH-805, JM-92, C-6359, and LH-6 were selected to compare the differences in nitrogen uptake and utilization yield, and quality. The aim was to provide theoretical basis for high yield, and high-efficiency wheat production in dryland of southeast loess Plateau. The results showed that the rainfall during the fallow period from 2019 to 2021 was 245.5 mm and 288.9 mm, respectively, and the nitrogen application rate was 180 kg ha-1.The highest transshipment amount, and transshipment rate of nitrogen before anther were found in YH-618, which reached 79.4 kg ha-1 and 58.6%, respectively. The yield of wheat cultivar YH-20410 was the highest, reaching 4890 kg ha-1, which was significantly higher than that of YH-805, JM-92, C-6359 and LH-6, but there was no significant difference of YH-618. The grain protein content of YH-618 was the highest (15.2%), which was not significantly different from that of JM-92, YH-805 and LH-6, but significantly higher than that of YH-20410, and C-6359, respectively. Therefore, in high-yield years, fallow cultivation can help adjust the relationship among the components, promote a reasonable distribution, and improve yield.

In this paper, we use a parametric directional distance approach to explore the farm-level abatement potential and cost (shadow value) of GHG for dryland farms in southwestern Australia. The study indicates that dryland agriculture could abate substantial GHG emissions and save agricultural inputs simultaneously. For the years 2006-2013, the average abatement potential ratios fluctuated between 17 and 33%, with a mean value of 21%. The mean shadow price of dryland agricultural GHG was $17.60 per tonne CO2-e in 2013 Australian dollars. In general, the analysis supports that reducing GHG in dryland agriculture is relatively cost-effective.

The objective of this study was to analyze the contribution of sorghum to increasing income and the level of welfare of dryland farmer households in Wonogiri, Central Java, Indonesia. The study was conducted from October to December 2022 using a survey method through direct interviews with purposively selected sorghum-growing farmers. A set of questions included household income and expenditure. The average total income and expenditure indicators, poverty line figures, RMW, and ERFHI were used to measure the welfare level of farmer households. The study found that the income derived from sorghum contributes 22.87% to total household income and tends to increase household income by 29.65%. According to the average total income earned, farming households were in a prosperous condition. This can be seen from the total income, which is higher than the total expenditure, the average per capita income higher than the poverty line, the average total income higher than RMW, and the value of ERFHI at 1.25. Income derived from sorghum has increased by 21.43-56.00% from less prosperous households to prosperous ones. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the existing literature on sorghum development and farmers' income and to be a reference for policy makers in formulating poverty alleviation programs and improving the welfare of farmer households, as well as expanding sorghum development by optimizing the utilization of agroecological, economic and social resources.

J	Sun, LW; Yan, NH				Sun, Liwei; Yan, Naihe			Effects of Bioorganic Fertilizer on Soil Nutrients and Microbial Biomass of Dryland Oats	EKOLOJI												Soil nutrients and microbial biomass of dryland oats are of great significance to increase crop yield. Therefore, the effects of bio-organic fertilizer on dryland oats are studied from the perspective of soil nutrients and microbial biomass. The dryland oat producing area is selected as the experimental research area. Five treatments are applied in this area, including no application of biological organic fertilizer (CK), application of biological organic fertilizer forone year (H1), fortwo years (H2), forthree years (H3) and forfour years (H4). The oat variety is Bajun No. 1, and the biological organic fertilizer consists of animal manure and crop straw. The results show that the contents of soil organic matter, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, alkalihydrolyzed nitrogen, available phosphorus and available potassium in 0-20 cm dryland oat soil are significantly higher than those in CK. 75 t and 90 t bio-organic fertilizer per hm(2) increases soil organic matter from 0.732% before the experiment to 0.947% and 0.985%. Soil microbial biomass C, N and P contents in different bio-organic fertilizer treatments are as follows: H4 > H3 > H2 > H1 > CK. Therefore, the application of bio-organic fertilizer can improve the nutrient and microbial biomass of dryland oat soil.																			1300-1361						2019	28	107					3541	3550	UNSP e107397															WOS:000461678300396

A numerical bifurcation analysis of a dryland vegetation model	COMMUNICATIONS IN NONLINEAR SCIENCE AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION												The dryland vegetation model proposed by Rietkerk and collaborators has been explored in several previous studies. Our aim here is to explore in some detail the bifurcation phenomena present when the coefficients of the model are allowed to vary in a wide range of parameters. In addition to the primary bifurcation parameter, the precipitation, we allow the two infiltration rate parameters to vary as well. We find that these two parameters control the size and stability of inhomogeneous biomass states in a way that can be predicted. Further, they control when certain homogeneous and inhomogeneous (in space) periodic (in time) orbits exist. Finally, we show that the model possesses infinitely many unphysical steady state branches. We then present a modification of the model which eliminates these unphysical solutions, and briefly explore this new model for a fixed set of parameters. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, how to comprehensively assess the shift of dryland ecological quality remains challenging. The ecological quality of specific dryland ecosystem in Northern China is less investigated following the launch of long-term large-scale national ecological restoration projects. This study established a dryland ecological quality assessment framework by the "One-out, all-out (1OAO)" principle. The ecological quality dynamics of Otindag sandy land in Northern China was evaluated by choosing 16 years (2000-2015) ecological quality as a baseline and comparing it to the report period (2005-2020). Three indicators, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil organic carbon (SOC) and dust sandstorm (DSS) was used to represent vegetation, soil and atmosphere quality, respectively. Our results showed that the vegetation quality kept stable in most areas, improved area of vegetation quality accounted for 30% of Otindag sandy land. The soil quality improved and degraded area accounted for 10% and 83%, respectively. The atmosphere quality increased in 98% area of Otindag sandy land. Overall, the ecological quality of Otindag sandy land improved in one fifth but degraded in four fifth following the launch of the national ecology restoration projects. Both degradation area is persistent since 2000 and no recent degradation found compared baseline to report period. The improvement was mainly in the southeastern part and the degradation was in western part of Otindag sandy land.

Examining typical dryland yield potentials and yield improvement measures is crucial for developing future dryland crop production systems. This case study u sed crop modeling to analyze dryland maize yield potential (YPd), farmers' yield potential (YPf), and actual farm yields (Y-a) from 1990 to 2015 in three counties in western Kansas (i.e., Thomas, Greeley, and Finney in the U.S. Great Plains region). The calibrated APSIM-Maize model along with actual yields was used to estimate yield gaps attributed to: (a) agronomic factors (YG(1) = YPd - YPf) and (b) socioeconomic constraints (YG(2) = YPf - Y-a). Observed climate conditions during maize-growing seasons showed warming, brightening, and drying trends for all three counties in western Kansas from 1990 to 2015. Our results showed that the current actual farm yields (Y-a) in western Kansas represented only 34%, 32%, and 28% of YPd in Thomas, Greeley, and Finney counties, respectively, indicating significant exploitable yield gaps. Agronomic factors (YG(1)) contributed the greatest to the yield gap in Greeley and Finney counties, whereas socioeconomic constraints (YG(2)) offered the greatest opportunity for improvement in Thomas county. Our analysis suggested that improving agronomic management could be a greater priority for further yield improvement in Greeley county, but selecting an appropriate hybrid was a greater priority in Finney county.

Desertification induced by both climate changes and human activities seriously threatens dryland vegetation. However, the impact of climate change on distribution of dryland plant species has not been well documented. Here, we studied the potential distribution of four representative dryland plant species (Haloxylon ammodendron, Anabasis aphylla, Calligonum mongolicum, and Populus euphratica) under current and future climate scenarios in a temperate desert region, aiming to improve our understanding of the responses of dryland plant species to climate change and provide guidance for dryland conservation and afforestation. Location Junggar Basin, a large desert region in northwestern China. Methods Occurrence data of the studied species were collected from an extensive field investigation of 2,516 sampling sites in the Junggar Basin. Ensemble species distribution models using 10 algorithms were developed and used to predict the potential distribution of each studied species under current and future climate scenarios. Result Haloxylon ammodendron and A. aphylla were likely to lose most of their current suitable habitats under future climate scenarios, while C. mongolicum and P. euphratica were likely to expand their ranges or remain relatively stationary. Variable importance evaluation showed that the most important climate variables influencing species distribution differed across the studied species. These results may be explained by the different ecophysiological characteristics and adaptation strategies to the environment of the four studied species. Main conclusions We explored the responses of the representative dryland plant species to climate change in the Junggar Basin in northwestern China. The different changes in suitability of different species imply that policymakers may need to reconsider the selection and combination of the afforestation species used in this area. This study can provide valuable reference for the management and conservation of dryland ecosystems under future climate change scenarios.

J	Casado, A				Casado, Ana			Rainfall-runoff modelling in dryland catchments, Sauce Grande, Argentina	TECNOLOGIA Y CIENCIAS DEL AGUA												The poor understanding of the hydrological functioning of many dryland catchments challenges hydrological modeling on both a discrete and a continuous basis. This paper implements a simple yet robust conceptual rainfall-runoff model, GR2M, to predict long-term monthly runoff in the Sauce Grande catchment (Argentina). It aims at determining whether (i) simple rainfall-runoff models perform satisfactorily on dryland catchments, and (ii) the parameter transfer from calibration to validation works in the context of climate-driven flow variability. Two model versions are evaluated and compared considering similar and contrasting catchment conditions along the period of record. Calibration results showed from 88 to 90 % efficiency on runoff predictions (on average), with variations along calibration periods linked to prevailing flow conditions (magnitude, variability, and constancy). From both, the model version separating the part of direct runoff from subsurface flow showed greater sensitivity to extreme flow conditions and greater structure adaptability to the full range of flows. Efficiency losses from calibration to validation were yet marked (22 %, on average), and responded primarily to runoff overestimations on periods of low flow. Parameters were allowed to evolve along with hydroclimatic conditions based on decision tree learning. Through this modification, the predictive efficiency of GR2M improved by 97 %. In addition to validating the robustness of simple rainfall-runoff models on drylands once parameters may evolve, this paper yields new hydrological data that constitutes an important platform to underpin further water resources planning and management in this highly regulated catchment.

Ecologically relevant moisture and temperature metrics for assessing dryland ecosystem dynamics	ECOHYDROLOGY												In drylands, water-limited regions that cover similar to 40% of the global land surface, ecosystems are primarily controlled by access to soil moisture and exposure to simultaneously hot and dry conditions. Quantifying ecologically relevant environmental metrics is difficult in drylands because the response of vegetation to moisture and temperature conditions is not easily explained solely by climate-based metrics. To address this knowledge gap, we developed and examined 27 climate and ecological drought metrics across dryland areas of the western United States. Included in the 27 metrics is a suite of 19 largely new "ecological drought metrics" that are designed to quantify multiple aspects of environmental limitation in drylands, including overall growing conditions, seasonal fluctuations, seasonal moisture timing, exposure to extreme drought and recruitment potential for perennial plants. To quantify these metrics, we simulated water balance pools and fluxes of daily soil moisture at multiple depths with historical weather from 1970 to 2010 using the SOILWAT2 ecosystem water balance model. We assessed the relationships among these metrics and their spatial and temporal patterns. We found that the inclusion of ecological drought metrics substantially increased the dimensionality of the climate metrics dataset; the number of independent variables needed to explain 90% of the variance in the dataset increased with the addition of ecological drought metrics. Spatial patterns in overall growing conditions represented well-known differences among ecoregions, for example, high temperatures and low precipitation in the southwest and cool temperatures and greater precipitation in the northeast. Seasonal fluctuation in soil water availability (SWA) was greatest in the southwest (Mojave Desert), whereas fluctuation in climatic water deficit (CWD) was greatest in the northwest (northern Great Basin and Columbia Plateau). Seasonal timing of moisture also differed among metrics; the timing of wet degree days (WDD), the timing of SWA and the timing of CWD were only weakly related to seasonal timing of precipitation. Plant recruitment metrics varied strongly across western drylands. In the Great Plains, recruitment events occurred more frequently and lasted longer than in the intermountain regions, where recruitment events were comparatively rare and short. These ecological drought metrics provide new insight into patterns of soil moisture and temperature that shape the structure and function of dryland ecosystems. The metrics will be useful for assessing the potential impact of climate change on dryland ecosystems and developing adaptive resource management strategies to sustain dryland ecosystem services in a changing world.

However, our understanding of these states is still limited, particularly at the global level. In this study, we utilized remote sensing data to analyze the distribution of tree cover in drylands and assess the impacts of factors such as the aridity index, temperature, fire frequency, and grazing on tree cover at both the global and continental scales. The results showed that dryland ecosystems in Asia, Australia, and South America exhibited alternative tree-cover states, while dryland ecosystems at the global scale and in Africa, Europe, and North America did not. Livestock density and the aridity index appeared to be the primary drivers of these states in the regions where they occurred. This study highlights the importance of considering the variability in dryland vegetation states across different scales and regions, as small-scale processes may not always accurately predict large-scale dynamics. By examining dryland woody vegetation at both global and continental scales, our work contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that affect the tree-cover states in these ecosystems.																			0168-1923	1873-2240				JUN 15	2023	337								109497	10.1016/j.agrformet.2023.109497	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2023.109497		MAY 2023											WOS:001001569000001

Many studies have investigated crop classification using SAR data, while few studies have focused on the classification of dryland crops by the new Gaofen-3 (GF3) SAR data. In this paper, taking Hengshui city as the study area, the performance of the Freeman-Durden, Sato4, Singh4 and multi-component decomposition methods for dryland crop type classification applications are evaluated, and the potential of full-polarimetric GF3 data in dryland crop type classification are also investigated. The results show that the multi-component decomposition method produces the most accurate overall classifications (88.37%). Compared with the typical polarization decomposition techniques, the accuracy of the classification results using the new decomposition method is improved. In addition, the Freeman method generally yields the third-most accurate results, and the Sato4 (87.40%) and Singh4 (87.34%) methods yield secondary results. The overall classification accuracy of the GF3 data is very positive. These results demonstrate the great promising potential of GF3 SAR data for dryland crop monitoring applications.

We carried out a 3-year field experiment to determine the most suitable mulching period and method for dryland wheat production based on grain yield, soil water storage, nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) leaching, greenhouse gas emission intensity (GHGI) and economic profits. The experiment included two main treatments [summer fallow mulching (SFM) and year-round mulching (YRM)], and three sub-treatments [ridge plastic mulching plus furrow seeding (MP + F), whole-field plastic mulching plus bunch seeding (M-P), and crop straw mulching (M-S)]. The average grain yields for SFM and YRM were statistically similar. The average grain yields for MP + F, M-P and M-S were 5501, 5733 and 5690 kg ha(-1) under SFM, and 5609, 6488 and 6462 kg ha(-1) under YRM, respectively. The M-S under YRM achieved the highest economic profit of 1587 US $ ha(-1) per season. Both the average and yearly soil water contents before wheat sowing for SFM and YRM were statistically similar. However, M-S showed greater potential for soil water storage before sowing, followed by M-P and MP + F, under both YRM and SFM. For both SFM and YRM, the NO3--N accumulation in the 0-200 cm soil profile at sowing time was significantly higher than at harvest, thus suggesting that no NO3-N leaching occurred during the present study. The M-S under YRM had the lowest GHGI of 314 kg CO2 eq Mg-1. Therefore, M-S under YRM should be recommended to local farmers in dryland areas of China and other similar areas around the world.																			0959-6526	1879-1786				NOV 20	2021	325								129337	10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129337	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129337		OCT 2021											WOS:000729118200002

The main objective of this study was to improve the accuracy of dryland crop (maize and cotton) classification by combining multitype features and multitemporal polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) images in Hebei plain, China. Three quad-polarimetric RADARSAT-2 scenes were acquired between July and September 2018, from which 117 features were extracted using the Cloude-Pottier, Freeman-Durden, Yamaguchi, and multiple-component polarization decomposition methods, together with two polarization matrices (i.e., the coherency matrix and the covariance matrix). Random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms were used for classification of dryland crops and other land-cover types in this study. The accuracy of dryland crop classification using various single features and their combinations was compared for different imagery acquisition dates, and the performance of the two algorithms was evaluated quantitatively. The importance of all investigated features was assessed using the RF algorithm to optimize the features used and the imagery acquisition date for dryland crop classification. Results showed that the accuracy of dryland crop classification increases with evolution of the phenological period. In comparison with SVM, the RF algorithm showed better performance for dryland crop classification when using full polarimetric RADARSAT-2 data. Dryland crop classification accuracy was not improved substantially when using only backscattering intensity features or polarization decomposition parameters extracted from a single-date image. Satisfactory classification accuracy was achieved using 11 optimized features (derived from the Cloude-Pottier decomposition and the coherency matrix) from 2 RADARSAT-2 images (acquisition dates corresponding to the middle and late stages of dryland crop growth). This study provides an important reference for timely and accurate classification of dryland crop in Hebei plain, China.																				1424-8220				JAN	2021	21	2							332	10.3390/s21020332	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21020332								33419022					WOS:000611701700001

Drylands are projected to experience accelerated expansion over the next century, but the implications of this expansion on variability in gross primary production (GPP) remain elusive. Here we show that by 2100 total dryland GPP will increase by 12 +/- 3% relative to the 2000-2014 baseline. Because drylands will largely expand into formerly productive ecosystems, this increase in dryland GPP may not increase global GPP. Further, GPP per unit dryland area will decrease as degradation of historical drylands outpaces the higher GPP of expanded drylands. Dryland expansion and climate-induced conversions among sub-humid, semi-arid, arid, and hyper-arid subtypes will lead to substantial changes in regional and subtype contributions to global dryland GPP variability. Our results highlight the vulnerability of dryland subtypes to more frequent and severe climate extremes and suggest that regional variations will require different mitigation strategies.

Hydroseeding tackifiers and dryland moss restoration potential	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Tackifiers are long-chain carbon compounds used for soil stabilization and hydroseeding and could provide a vehicle for biological soil crust restoration. We examined the sensitivity of two dryland mosses, Bryum argenteum and Syntrichia ruralis, to three common tackifiers-guar, psyllium, and polyacrylamide (PAM)-at 0.5x, 1.0x, and 2.0x of recommended (x) concentrations for erosion control and revegetation. We measured moss shoot, gemma, and protonema production as well as moss organic matter and bound sand masses as indicators of growth and soil holding ability. We tested sand and tackifier chemistry to investigate potential nutrient and toxicant potential on moss growth. Groups of 10 fragments from field-collected mosses were grown on sand in open petri dishes arranged in a growth chamber in replicated blocks containing each tackifier and concentration combination plus a distilled water control. Bryum (n = 10) and Syntrichia (n = 9) growth were measured at the end of 6 and 5 weeks, respectively. Overall model tests yielded statistically significant results (p < 0.001) for every variable in each species. When compared to water, guar tended to decrease growth, psyllium tended to increase growth, and PAM's effects were generally neutral to positive. Within tackifier types, increasing concentrations of guar tended to decrease growth, while increasing concentrations of psyllium tended to increase growth. Changes in PAM concentrations had little effect on growth. Increases in guar and psyllium lowered pH and increased P and K. Psyllium and PAM yielded promising results as potential agents of dispersal and adherence of dryland mosses in field restoration.

Therefore the effect of different concentrations of potassium (0, 75, 150 kg ha(-1) K2SO4) on photosynthesis efficiency of three winter wheat cultivars (Baran, Homa, Hashtrud) was investigated during the growing seasons of 2017-18 and 2018-19 under cold dryland conditions in Maragheh, Iran. Accumulation of potassium ion (K+) was observed to be increased with an increase in the concentration of K2SO4. With an increase in K+ the Hashtrud cultivar was observed to have more relative water content (RWC), normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), and stomatal conductance (gs) than other cultivars. This resulted in a higher grain yield for the Hashtrud cultivar. RWC (R-2 = 0.97), NDVI (R-2 = 0.96), and gs (R-2 = 0.92) had a positive relationship with KUE (grain yield/unit of K fertilizer used), especially in dryer years. K deficiency induced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in plants. The application of K increased superoxide dismutases and reduced abscisic acid, to maintain the plants' stomatal conductance. Chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlF) and the calculation of double normalized relative variable fluorescence reveal detailed information's about the response of wheat plants to K application under dryland conditions. The application of a high concentration of K (150 kg ha(-1) K2SO4) on Hashtrud plants had a beneficial effect on the ChlF efficiency at different OJIP phases (KJ and JI). We found the efficiency of ChlF at the Delta WK-I phase with the values of F-V/F-O and PIABS improved with the application of 150 kg ha(-1) K2SO4 and can be correlated with total yield improvement. These observations indicated that the application of a high concentration of K in stressed conditions for dryland areas could improve photosynthetic efficiency and wheat plant performance.

The vegetation organization in these ecosystems is driven by the water regime as the main driver, but local processes like seed banks and soil resources redistribution also play a crucial role in determining the spatial distribution of the vegetation. Assessment of vegetation dynamics and long-term resilience requires the use of realistic models that can integrate the water regime and that can continuously simulate vegetation extent and conditions under flood-drought cycles. Here we study the influence of the water regime as the main driver of the vegetation. We apply a vegetation-modelling framework to compare the performance of a simplified model at the cell scale and a model integrated at a patch scale. Our results show that aggregating the analysis of vegetation dynamics at the patch scale allows for the incorporation of the effects of both local drivers (acting within the patch) as well as the global drivers (acting over the patch as a whole). The water regime acts as a global driver for the vegetation and indirectly affects the local drivers. Our patch scale model successfully captures wetland vegetation dynamics using the water regime as the main driver for representing changes in the vegetation and assessment of the wetland resilience under flood-drought periods.

J	Wu, BF; Zeng, HW; Lü, N; Wang, YF; Fu, BJ; Xu, ZH				Wu, Bingfang; Zeng, Hongwei; Lu, Nan; Wang, Yanfen; Fu, Bojie; Xu, Zhihong			Essential dryland ecosystem variables	CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY												Long-term and high-quality data are needed to assess the status, variability, change and drivers of dryland ecosystems, but these data are often lacking because dryland ecosystems are less studied without a consistent and systematic indicator framework. Moreover, these data are difficult to derive due to the highly fragmented spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability, which undermines our understanding of dryland ecosystems. This paper reviews the gaps in the existing essential variables of dryland ecosystems and proposes four criteria to identify essential dryland ecosystem variables (EDVs). The preliminary proposed EDVs have 6 dimensions and include 15 variables, which highlights the gaps in the current essential variables of thematic domains and focuses on the traits of dryland ecosystems. This study is only a first attempt, and a long-term process is required to establish the final EDVs and reach a consensus in the global dryland research community.

J	Sainju, UM				Sainju, Upendra M.			The benefits of the no-till system on soil health and crop yields in dryland cropping systems	SOIL RESEARCH												Context. The no-till (NT) system is used to control soil erosion and nutrient losses, but extensive evaluation of NT on soil health and long-term crop yields compared to conventional till (CT) is needed to evaluate the overall benefit of NT. Aims. The objective of this study was to compare NT and CT on soil health and long-term crop yields in two dryland farming sites in the northern Great Plains, USA. Methods. Soil samples collected from two long-term (14- and 36-years-old) experiments of dryland farming under NT and CT continuous spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgaris L.)/spring wheat-fallow rotation were analysed for 66 soil physical, chemical, biological and biochemical properties and crop yields determined. Key results. NT increased wet soil stability index, average slake aggregate and total shrinkage by 12-61%, but reduced saturated hydraulic conductivity by 24-31% compared to CT. Soil Al, Ba, Cu and S concentrations were 10-16% greater, but electrical conductivity, Co, Na and Zn concentrations, and Na-absorption ratio were 9-33% lower with NT than CT. Similarly, NH4-N concentration, CO2 evolution, phospholipid-derived fatty acid (PLFA), phosphomonoesterase and arysulfatase were 13-38% greater, but water extractable N, NO3-N concentration and potential N mineralisation were 16-31% lower with NT than CT. Mean crop yield across years were similar between NT than CT. Conclusions. NT can enhance overall soil health and sustain dryland crop yields compared to CT in the northern Great Plains, USA.

J	Kato, A; Carlson, KM; Miura, T				Kato, Anna; Carlson, Kimberly M.; Miura, Tomoaki			Assessing the inter-annual variability of vegetation phenological events observed from satellite vegetation index time series in dryland sites	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Tracking dryland vegetation phenology under a changing climate is of great concern because dryland ecosystems have broad spatial coverage and are important drivers of global carbon cycles. However, dryland ecosystems often consist of two or more different vegetation types with divergent phenological patterns and are characterized by relatively low vegetation greenup signal compared to noise present in satellite imagery. Thus, accurately characterizing dryland phenology - including the start, peak, and end of season (SOS, POS, and EOS, respectively) - across large temporal and spatial scales with satellite vegetation indices (VIs) has proven challenging. Working across six dryland flux tower sites in the United States from 2003 to 2014, we asked: 1) How well do satellite VIs explain GPP? 2) How accurately can satellite VIs characterize the number and timing of phenological transition dates? and 3) Why does this accuracy vary across VIs? To address these questions, we used daily GPP data from the FLUXNET2015 dataset. We computed four daily VIs from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) sensor including two greenness indices (i.e., NDVI and EVI), and two waterrelated indices (i.e., Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and NDVI-LSWI difference). We derived phenological transition dates from spline smoothed VI and GPP time series. We found that all major phenological patterns apparent in GPP time series were present in VI data across sites and VIs. Among the four VIs, EVI explained the most variance in daily GPP (R2 = 0.65). Between 88 and 90% of phenological events found in GPP time series - especially recurring, large magnitude events but also some sporadic, small ephemeral events - were detected from MODIS VI data. The rate of omission, when an event was detected from GPP but not from VI data, was similar across VIs (10-12% of all GPP events). Commissions, when an event was detected from VI but not from GPP data, varied more widely from 18% for NDVI to 30% for LSWI. Transition date accuracy as measured by mean absolute difference (MAD) between GPP- and VI-derived SOS and POS ranged from 13 to 15 days across VIs but was lower for EOS (17-26 days). EOS from LSWI most accurately characterized GPP-derived EOS. This may be because LSWI is sensitive to leaf water content, which declines in certain dryland vegetation even when leaves remain green. Our results highlight the potential for satellite VI-derived metrics to accurately track spatiotemporal variation in the phenological event occurrence and timing in dryland ecosystems.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				NOV	2021	130								108042	10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108042		JUL 2021											WOS:000692541100003

Meanwhile, upland rice has received less attention, and it has not been used to its full potential. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of various combinations of inorganic fertilizers, poultry manure, and upland rice varieties on the production and economic value of karst dryland in Gunungkidul, Yogyakarta. This experiment was arranged in a factorial design, with inorganic fertilizers, poultry manure, and upland rice varieties set in a randomized block design with three replications. The first factor was a combination of inorganic and organic fertilizer rates: 72 N kg ha(-1) + 26 P2O5 kg ha(-1) + 25 K2O ha(-1) + 3 t ha(-1) organic, 92 N kg ha(-1) + 36 P2O5 kg ha(-1) + 30 K2O kg ha(-1) + 2 t ha(-1) organic, 112 N kg ha(-1) + 46 P2O5 kg ha(-1) + 35 K2O kg ha(-1) + 1 t ha(-1) organic. The second factor is the upland varieties of Inpago 8, Inpago 10, and Inpago 12 and lowland variety Inpari 42 Agritan GSR, as checked. Based on the study, we concluded that the combination of 92 N kg ha(-1) + 36 P2O5 kg ha(-1) + 30 K2O kg ha(-1) + 2 t ha(-1) poultry manure fertilizers with Inpago 8 resulted in an IDR profit of 23,586,000 ha(-1), and it is the most recommendable fertilizer and variety combination to be developed in the karst dryland, in consideration of land fertility and sustainability.

J	Sainju, UM; Liptzin, D				Sainju, Upendra M.; Liptzin, Daniel			Relating soil chemical properties to other soil properties and dryland crop production	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Soil chemical properties have often been related to some other soil properties and crop yields, but extensive evaluation of the relationships of soil chemical properties with other properties and long-term crop yields under dryland cropping systems is lacking. We related six soil chemical properties (pH, electrical conductivity [EC], cation exchange capacity [CEC], and inorganic P [IP], K, and Al concentrations) with 62 other soil physical, chemical, biological, and biochemical properties and crop yields at two long-term (14- and 36-year old) dryland farming sites in the northern Great Plain, United States. Treatments were rotations of no-tillage and conventional tillage spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), pea (Pisum sativum L.), and fallow with or without N fertilization. Soil samples collected to a depth of 0-15 cm in April 2019 were analyzed for soil properties and long-term crop yields were determined. Soil chemical properties were mostly correlated to each other at the short-term than at the long-term site. Based on the principal component analysis, EC, CEC, and IP, and K concentrations were associated with most of the physical, chemical, biological, and biochemical properties at both sites. The CEC, IP, and K concentrations were related to mean crop yields across years at individual or combined sites, but other chemical properties were not related to yields. We conclude that CEC, IP, and K concentrations may be used as potential chemical indicators of soil health that were related to most soil properties and crop yields under dryland cropping systems in the semiarid region.																				2296-665X				DEC 7	2022	10								1005114	10.3389/fenvs.2022.1005114	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.1005114													WOS:000898220500001

Winter wheat response to climate change under irrigated and dryland conditions in the US southern High Plains	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												A rise in global temperature has been observed since the 1980s. The objective of the study was to understand the winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) responses and yield performances to the changing climate. The study was performed using growing degree day (GDD) model and regression analysis method. Wheat data (1940 to 2016) were obtained from the Southern Regional Performance Nursery (SRPN) experiments at Bushland,Texas. Wheat genotypes were divided into three groups: Kharkof as a check cultivar, the highest yielding cultivar for each year, and all other cultivars. Climate data were obtained from USDA Agricultural Research Service at Bushland and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Temperatures between 1940 and 2016 showed a curvilinear trend with a significant rise since 1980. Mean temperature during wheat growing season (September 15 to June 15) increased at a rate of 0.35 degrees C per decade since 1980. Consequently, seasonal GDD and extreme degree days (EDD) increased at a rate of 69 degrees C d and 19 degrees C d per decade. From 1940 to 2016, wheat heading date has shifted earlier by 16 days for dryland wheat and 11 days for irrigated wheat. Maximum and minimum temperatures in March and April had a negative relationship with heading date, while precipitation had a positive relationship with heading date for both dryland and irrigated wheat. Early heading may have benefits for heat escape but also has the disadvantage of reducing precipitation prior to heading-a loss of 25 mm when heading shifted earlier by 16 days for dryland wheat. The five-year moving average yields increased steadily from about 1960 to 1980, plateaued until the late 1980s, and then declined significantly. However, average genetic yield gains were 505 kg ha(-1) under dryland and 1,671.4 kg ha(-1) under irrigated conditions for all new cultivars during 1940 to 2016. Yield trends for all three cultivar groups had similar patterns over the years. Increase in maximum temperature, frequencies of maximum temperature greater than or equal to 31 degrees C, and minimum temperature during grain filling period had significant negative effect on grain filling days and yield (except for minimum temperature under dryland conditions). Precipitation during the vegetative growth (November, January, and March) and grain filling (May) had a significant positive effect on dryland wheat yields, but only the January precipitation had significant effect on wheat yield under irrigated conditions. The study indicated that the rising temperature and shifting precipitation timings as a result of early heading are less favorable conditions for winter wheat production in the US southern High Plains.

Based on a land-use grid data set with an accuracy of 1 km, this study applied the Topographic Potential Index and used land-use transition matrices and landscape analysis to compare the change in dryland and paddy field in China from 1990 to 2020 at different elevations, slopes, and slope aspects. The results indicate that paddy field and dryland were mostly distributed in areas with better photothermal conditions. However, in recent years, the paddy field and dryland on the "sunny" slope decreased. Specifically, the area of paddy field and dryland on the southeast, south, and southwest slopes decreased, while they increased on the northwest, north, and northeast slopes. From 1990 to 2020, land conversion among paddy field, dryland, and other land use was mostly concentrated in the third ladder (<500 m elevation) of China. However, the changes in paddy field and dryland have now become active on the second ladder of China. Moreover, the change from other land to dryland on the second ladder accounted for nearly 50% of the country's change from other land to dryland. Paddy fields and drylands in areas with low elevation and low slopes were reduced, whereas those with higher elevation and higher slopes increased, indicating that the arable land in mountainous areas increased. This indicates that the topographic conditions of arable land that become worse may aggravate soil erosion in the planting process. The landscape fragmentation of paddy field and dryland increased. Compared with paddy field, the dryland was more aggregated, the shape was more complex, and the land plots were more fragmented. As a result, paddy field and dryland show significant differences in their spatial-temporal pattern, landscape characteristics, and land-use changes, and these results can provide an important reference for the sustainable utilization of arable land resources.																				2073-445X				OCT	2022	11	10							1851	10.3390/land11101851	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11101851													WOS:000873015900001

This experiment was designed to investigate the effects of selenium (Se) and supplemental irrigation (Irri) on physiological and biochemical changes in canola at sub-tropical dryland conditions. The research was conducted at Gachsaran, I. R. Iran, during 2016-18. Without Irri (I-1), supplemental Irri at the flowering (I-2), seed filling (I-3), flowering + seed filling (I-4) stage, and Hyola and Dalgan and Se [without-Se (S-0), 1.5 (S-1) and 3 (S-2) mg L-1 sodium selenate] were assigned. Results showed that I-1, S-1, and S-2 compared with S-0 increased the seed Se content by 9.9% and 23.7%, respectively, and I-4 by 6.3% and 15.5%. Leaf protein content increased with supplemental Irri. Se improved all of the biological and biochemical traits. The highest proline (6.84 mg g(FW)(-1)) was obtained from S-2 in Hyola. Also, the most leaf soluble sugars (19.45 mg g(FW)(-1)) got in Hyola from I-1. The leaf protein content was most in Hyola than the Dalgan. Leaf glycine betaine increased by 24.07% in I-1 compared with I-4. Catalase (CAT) activity in I-1 and S-2 increased by 39.01% relative to I-2 and S-0. The highest guaiacol peroxidase (GPOX) activity (0.225-unit g(-1) min(-1)) was obtained from I-1 and Hyola. In summary, the results show that in dryland canola cultivation, supplemental Irri with S-1 can reduce damages caused by water stress and improve the accumulation of compatible solutes and hence antioxidant activity.					faraji, hoshang/JPE-5360-2023; Movahhedi Dehnavi, Mohsen/HTS-6579-2023; Balouchi, Hamidreza/I-7655-2019; mohtashami, raham/R-7301-2017	faraji, hoshang/0009-0007-3176-0706; Balouchi, Hamidreza/0000-0001-8015-3215; mohtashami, raham/0000-0002-1595-7708													0137-5881	1861-1664				MAR	2023	45	3							47	10.1007/s11738-023-03532-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-023-03532-9													WOS:000937187400002

Increased construction of small reservoirs to mitigate the effects of droughts leads to a High-density Reservoirs Network (HdRN) of small reservoirs, which can potentially modify the streamflows both in dry and wet periods. However, there is a lack of understanding of the interannual behavior of flow retention and the impact of future increases in the number of small reservoirs, mainly for HdRN in dryland catchments. This research aims to determine the possible impact of the increase in the number of small reservoirs on dry hydrological networks, evaluating the annual flows generated at the outlet of a dryland watershed for scenarios with different densities of small reservoirs (number of reservoirs per area). The study area was the Conceicao river catchment (3347 km(2)) in the semiarid of Brazil. The hydrological model of the study area was developed in SWAT. The model obtained appropriate results for daily streamflows, with values of 0.63, 0.81, and 0.53% for NSE, KGE, and PBIAS, respectively. The current density of small reservoirs in the region was estimated at 0.068 reservoirs per square kilometer (res/km(2)). Eight expansion scenarios were defined for densities between 0.1 res/km(2) and 3.0 res/km(2). The results showed that the influence of the HdRN on runoff reduction mostly occurs for a probability of exceedance between 1% and 10% of month flows and is very small for months with very high peaks of flow. The reduction in the outlet flow due to the increase in the number of small reservoirs was stronger during dry years (up to 30%) than during wet years (up to 8%), and it tended to increase in years with a consecutive lack of rain (from about 7% in the first year to about 20% in the last year and in the worst scenario), which may intensify the period of extended droughts. This research provides insights about the impact of the increase in the number of small reservoirs on the interannual variability of flow retention, and the understanding of the influence of small reservoirs on runoff reduction may help water resources agencies better prepare for hydrologic extremes (droughts and floods).

Dryland avulsion sequences: Insights from data-model comparison of a terminal dryland river system	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												An advection-diffusion model of fluvial processes was used to analyze the stratigraphic expression of avulsions in terminal river systems and understand their control on basin-fill architecture. The initial and boundary condi-tions of the model runs (i.e., catchment area, smoothed initial topographic surface, grain-size distribution and sediment supply rates) were extracted from the modern Rio Colorado dryland terminal river system in the Altiplano Basin (Bolivia). Water-discharge and sediment-load values were derived from global regression curves and the BQART equation, respectively. To evaluate the robustness of the simulations, the model was tested under increasing sediment-load scenarios ranging from 0.003 m(3)/s to 0.095 m(3)/s. Data-model comparison provided insights into the role of avulsions in the geomorphological evolution of terminal river systems. The observed stacking of sediments, as captured by geospatial and geochronological data from the Rio Colorado, is consistent with the high sediment-load scenarios, which start with a single-thread fluvial channel that in time radially expands over the floodplain by successive river avulsions on account of alluvial-ridge aggradation and channel-floor elevation above the surrounding floodplain. The model output shows a laterally extensive, convex-upwards lobate topography which is in agreement with the lateral and longitudinal geomorphology in the upper and lower coastal plain of the Rio Colorado. The simulated inter-avulsion period, which is the time period between two successive full (or sta-bilized) avulsions in the model, varies from 0.18 to 1.2 kyr and is consistent with the OSL-age determination in the Rio Colorado with inter-avulsion periods up to 1.28 +/- 0.34 kyr.

J	Finley, JB; Robinson, E; DeRose, RJ				Finley, Judson Byrd; Robinson, Erick; DeRose, R. Justin			Arroyo formation impacts on an early dryland agricultural community in Northeastern Utah, USA	GEOARCHAEOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												Indigenous Fremont farmers in Cub Creek, a part of northeastern Utah's Dinosaur National Monument, occupied the northern ecological margin of maize cultivation in western North America from A.D. 300 to 1300. Agriculture in Cub Creek was a response to multidecadal precipitation variability, but when precipitation stabilized between A.D. 750 and 1050, agricultural conditions improved and populations expanded to form villages along the floodplains of local dryland streams. Did the very same conditions (i.e., decreased precipitation variability) that allowed the growth of agricultural societies make them simultaneously vulnerable to arroyo formation, a key geomorphic risk to floodplain agriculturalists? Preliminary results from Cub Creek show that rapid sedimentation punctuated by episodic arroyo formation characterized the last 2000 years. We use stratigraphic and chronological evidence formalized in a Bayesian age model to develop a set of working hypotheses that a 2.5 m-deep discontinuous arroyo formed before either A.D. 1020 or A.D. 1275. The earlier age corresponds with occupation of the Cub Creek village, while the later age corresponds with the end of Fremont agriculture in Cub Creek, and demonstrates regional synchronicity with arroyo formation across the Colorado Plateau. A second arroyo formed before A.D. 1490, indicating rapid alluvial cycling in Cub Creek. We conclude that floodplain instability and arroyo formation combined with the return of the dominant multidecadal precipitation variability regime beginning at A.D. 1050 was a key constraint on the growth potential of local populations. These findings have potential implications for the development of early Indigenous dryland agricultural systems throughout the interior of western North America.

J	Vélez-Agudelo, C; Espinosa, MA; Fayó, R				Velez-Agudelo, Camilo; Espinosa, Marcela A.; Fayo, Rocio			Diatom-based inference model for conductivity reconstructions in dryland river systems from north Patagonia, Argentina	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Dryland river systems support a diverse aquatic biota in semi-arid and arid landscapes, but they are increasingly vulnerable to natural and human impacts. This study provides the first modern diatom training set (n = 38) from three dryland rivers in northern Patagonia, Argentina. The relationship between surface-sediment diatoms and contemporary environmental variables was explored using multivariate analyses. The results showed that surface-water chemistry varies among rivers in accordance with local-scale factors such hydro-climatic variability and anthropic activities. A total of 378 diatom taxa were identified but only 45 taxa occurred with relative abundances higher than 2% in at least one sediment sample. The Colorado and Negro rivers were characterized by high abundances of small tychoplanktic fragilarioids whereas the Chubut River was dominated by epiphytic and planktic taxa. The canonical correspondence analyses (CCA) showed that conductivity, pH and HCO3- were the main environmental variables governing diatoms distributions. A transfer function was developed for water conductivity using unimodal methods because of partial CCA and lambda(1)/lambda(2) ratio revealed that this variable had the largest unique effect on diatom variance. A weighted averaging (WA) model with tolerance downweighting and classic deshrinking provided a reasonably robust model (r(jack)(2) = 0.94 and RMSEP = 0.249 log(10) mu S cm(-1)). However, the diatom-inferred conductivity values should be carefully interpreted because of the uneven distribution of sampling sites and the dominance of small araphid diatoms belonging to the genera Staurosira, Pseudostaurosira and Punctastriata. By their benthic habitat, the distribution of these taxa could be influenced by other factors as light and substrate in addition to water chemistry. The autoecological information achieved through this study will provide the basis for a better insight into the hydrological responses of the dryland rivers in northern Patagonia to climate and environmental changes.																			1015-1621	1420-9055				OCT	2021	83	4							64	10.1007/s00027-021-00819-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-021-00819-2													WOS:000675397800001

Satellite solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and near-infrared reflectance capture complementary aspects of dryland vegetation productivity dynamics	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Mounting evidence indicates dryland ecosystems play an important role in driving the interannual variability and trend of the terrestrial carbon sink. Nevertheless, our understanding of the seasonal dynamics of dryland ecosystem carbon uptake through photosynthesis [gross primary productivity (GPP)] remains relatively limited due in part to the limited availability of long-term data and unique challenges associated with satellite remote sensing across dryland ecosystems. Here, we comprehensively evaluated longstanding and emerging satellite vegetation proxies in their ability to capture seasonal dryland GPP dynamics. Specifically, we evaluated: 1) reflectance-based proxies normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), near infrared reflectance index (NIRv), and kernel NDVI (kNDVI) from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); and 2) newly available physiologically-based proxy solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). As a performance benchmark, we used GPP estimates from a robust network of 21 western United States eddy covariance tower sites that span representative gradients in dryland ecosystem climate and functional composition. We found that NIRv and SIF were the best performing GPP proxies and captured complementary aspects of seasonal GPP dynamics across dryland ecosystem types. NIRv offered better performance than the other proxies across relatively low-productivity, sparsely non-evergreen vegetated sites (R2 = 0.59 +/- 0.13); whereas SIF best captured seasonal dynamics across relatively high-productivity sites, including evergreen-dominated sites (R2 = 0.74 +/- 0.07). Notably, across grass-dominated sites, all reflectance-based proxies (NDVI, SAVI, NIRv and kNDVI) showed significant seasonal bias (hysteresis) that strengthened with the total fraction of woody vegetation cover, likely due to seasonal patterns in woody vegetation reflectance that are unrelated to or decoupled from GPP. Future efforts to fully integrate the complementary strengths of NIRv and SIF could significantly improve our understanding and representation of dryland GPP dynamics in satellite-based models.

As part of a sustainable approach to developing biocrust restoration, we argue that a complementary step is to improve and accelerate methods for salvaging biocrusts that would otherwise be destroyed in a forthcoming disturbance. The increasing rate and scale of disturbance pressures in drylands where biocrusts flourish means that the supply of salvageable biocrust and demand for that material in restoration greatly exceed the present cultivable supply. In this article we describe the state of knowledge for biocrust salvage, present a simple set of steps for conducting a salvage harvest, discuss risks and benefits when considering using salvage, and suggest future research directions to facilitate scaling up biocrust restoration using salvaged material. A focus on the use of salvaged biocrust as a restoration source may prove an important step to improve ecological restoration in notoriously difficult to restore dryland ecosystems.

To improve ESs, it is necessary to understand how they interact in drylands. In this study, we selected Ordos dryland, which is situated in northern China, as the study area to assess its four key ESs-food supply (FS), carbon storage (CS), water yield (WY), and habitat quality (HQ)-and to identify the hotspots of multiple ES supply. Furthermore, we studied the constraint effects between ESs in Ordos in 2000, 2010, and 2020 and used a spatial trade-off model to map the trade-off and synergy areas of ESs from 2000 to 2010 and from 2010 to 2020. The results indicated that all four ESs in Ordos increased significantly over the study period. The hotspots for the supply of multiple ESs also increased in areal extent during this period, and the state of the regional ecological environment continued to improve. The constraint effect between ESs showed that as the CS increased, its constraint effect on WY and FS decreased and then increased, whereas its constraint effect on HQ only decreased; as the WY increased, its constraint effect on HQ decreased and then increased, and its constraint effect on FS continued to decrease; as the FS increased, its constraint effect on HQ continued to increase. From the change in the area of ESs trade-offs and synergies, there was an increase in the area of positive synergy for four pairs of ESs in Ordos, which were CS-WY, CS-HQ, WY-HQ, and FS-HQ. These findings help in establishing a scientific foundation for the management and optimization of ESs in drylands.

They are severely affected by human activities and climate change. Dynamic changes in the drylands and within subtype (hyper-arid, arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid) areas, and the spatiotemporal characteristics in net primary productivity (NPP) of vegetation, are crucial for evaluating ecosystem functions and management strategies in China. This study defined drylands, and the area was determined based on the aridity index (AI). Our results demonstrated the drylands of China expanded from 5.8 million km(2) in 1980 to 6.6 million km(2) in 2020, with an average expansion rate of 0.019 x 10(6) km(2) (10 yr)(-1). These changes were driven mainly by the mean annual temperature (MAT) and solar radiation (Srad). Among the different subtypes of drylands, the arid and semi-arid areas expanded the fastest at 0.032 x 10(6) km(2) (10 yr)(-1), and the main driving factor was MAT. However, the hyper-arid area decreased in size at an average rate of 0.050 x 10(6) km(2) (10 yr)(-1), and the main driving factor was mean annual precipitation (MAP). Net primary productivity (NPP) of total vegetation and subtypes increased over 20 years. The NPP of the whole dryland increased at a rate of 10.78 g C m(-2) yr(-1), which was dominated by the rapid growth of NPP (5.15 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) in dry sub-humid areas. The NPP of four vegetation types (desert, grassland, forest, and cropland) increased (19.14 Tg C yr(-1)); the NPP in the forest and cropland increased considerably, while that in the grassland and desert increased slightly. The drylands in China might further expand with global warming because the MAT strongly affects the changes in dryland areas. With the development of eco-environmental protection projects (afforestation, construction of desert highway protection forest, etc.) and western region development and construction in China, the contribution of forest and cropland to the total NPP of all vegetation will increase.																			2347-4327	0973-774X				MAY 11	2023	132	2							83	10.1007/s12040-023-02100-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12040-023-02100-6													WOS:000986190000001

Most dryland farmers perform conventional disintegrated farming practices due to a lack of knowledge and resource inefficiency. This study investigates the possibility of an Integrated Farming System (IFS) to address the current dryland farming issues and explore various factors affecting its adoption among the farming community. This study aims to apply and compare supervised learning techniques to assess the primary drivers affecting the adoption of the IFS in rural southern India. The study shows that organic fertilizer production, farmers' age, and involvement in the extension activity are the major factors affecting the adoption of IFS among dryland farmers. The study supports that small and marginal farmers have a high possibility of realizing the higher benefit from IFS. The study recommends that these components be given proper policy consideration in designing and implementing an effective farming system in dryland areas to improve farmers' income levels.																			0021-9096	1745-2538				2022 OCT 18	2022										10.1177/00219096221130350	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00219096221130350		OCT 2022											WOS:000869940100001

Addressing barriers to improve biocrust colonization and establishment in dryland restoration	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Methods to reduce soil loss and associated loss of ecosystem functions due to land degradation are of particular importance in dryland ecosystems. Biocrusts are communities of cyanobacteria, lichens, and bryophytes that are vulnerable to soil disturbance, but provide vital ecosystem functions when present. Biocrusts stabilize soil, improve hydrologic function, and increase nutrient and carbon inputs. Methods to reestablish biocrust rapidly, when lost from ecosystems, have the potential to restore important dryland ecosystem functions and thereby increase probability of successful rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to identify habitat ameliorations to enhance the success of biocrust inoculation by: (1) reducing physiological stress on biocrusts and increasing resource availability (using shade, soil surface roughening, and watering), and (2) stabilizing mobile soils (using straw borders, three soil tackifiers [soil stabilizers], and a combination of shade, water, roughening, and tackifier). In the Great Basin Desert on the Utah Test and Training Range near Salt Lake City, we applied field-harvested biocrust material to experimental plots on coarse- and fine-textured soils with the top 2 cm of soil and biocrust removed. Habitat ameliorations were applied with and without biocrust addition. Shade provision increased biocrust cover 50% over controls. Biocrust cover and soil stability were 65% lower in straw border plots relative to controls. Soil tackifiers, alone and in combination with resource augmentation and stress reduction, did not improve cover and stabilization over inoculated controls. We found variability in recovery by time and between soil types. These results suggest plausible strategies to improve success of biocrust inoculation.

Although the mechanisms initiating and maintaining dryland degradation are largely understood, returning productivity and function through ecological restoration remains difficult. Water limitation commonly drives slow recovery rates within drylands; however, the altered biogeochemical cycles that accompany degradation also play key roles in limiting restoration outcomes. Addressing biogeochemical changes and resource limitations may help improve restoration efforts within this difficult-to-restore biome. In the present article, we present a synthesis of restoration literature that identifies multiple ways biogeochemical understandings might augment dryland restoration outcomes, including timing restoration around resource cycling and uptake, connecting heterogeneous landscapes, manipulating resource pools, and using organismal functional traits to a restoration advantage. We conclude by suggesting ways to incorporate biogeochemistry into existing restoration frameworks and discuss research directions that may help improve restoration outcomes in the world's highly altered dryland landscapes.

Over the past century, wildfire frequency and size have increased dramatically because of invasion by fire-promoting non-native invasive species, greatly threatening these ecosystems. Native species restoration is a tool that can disrupt the cycle of increased fire and invasion in lowland dry forest communities, but restoration prescriptions have not been studied systematically in other dryland plant communities. We examined the restoration of three Hawaiian dryland plant communities (a high-productivity Diospyros sandwicensis and Metrosideros polymorpha lowland dry forest (HP), a moderate-productivity Myoporum sandwicense and Sophora chrysophylla dry forest/woodland (MP), and a low-productivity Dodonaea viscosa shrubland (LP)), using a community-assembly framework to understand the abiotic and biotic constraints to species establishment and growth in each community. Because active restoration methods are often needed, at both high and low levels of productivity, we also examined restoration treatments and outcomes across the three sites, which spanned a gradient of rainfall and substrate age. At each site, we used the same factorial field experiment with three factors: habitat quality (high or low), weed control (yes or no), and species addition (none, seeding, or outplanting). Outplants (cohort 1) and seeds were added in the winter of 2009-2010, and outplants were added again in March 2011 (cohort 2). Dispersal limitation was apparent at the LP and HP sites, but was not observed in the MP site, which had, overall, greater native diversity and abundance. Outplant survival was greater in high-quality habitats at the HP site, likely due to reduced abiotic stress. Invasive species were found in greater abundance in certain types of microsites at the LP and MP sites, suggesting that shade or topography can be used to plan restoration and weed-control activities. Overall, active restoration methods improved restoration outcomes at the high- and low-productivity sites, and less so at the moderately productive site. Weed removal and outplanting were effective restoration prescriptions at the LP and HP sites, and habitat quality could also be used to increase survival at the HP site. Active restoration could be a lower priority for moderately invaded, moderate-productivity communities, which have the capability to maintain a native ecosystem state.																				2071-1050				MAY	2022	14	9							5421	10.3390/su14095421	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14095421													WOS:000796094300001

An experiment was conducted to set seven nitrogen application levels of N0, N90, N120, N150, N180, N210 and N240 kg ha-1 before sowing. The results showed that grain yield under the nitrogen rate of N210 kg ha-1 was significantly increase the water intake during jointing to anthesis, Soil water storage of dryland wheat in fallow period was higher than water consumption in jointing stage and the leaf area index at anthesis, the tiller percentage rate, the jointing-anthesis, and nitrogen accumulation were closely related to yield and its components. Nitrogen fertiliser rate N150 kg ha-1 significantly increased dry matter buildup from jointing to flowering in dryland wheat compared to N fertiliser rate N210 kg ha-1. The rise of nitrogen application rate, there were no significant variance in nitrogen accumulation of Stem + leaf sheath and cob + glume at maturity, respectively. N fertiliser rate N210 kg ha-1 compared to N180 kg ha-1 significantly reduced grain gliadin content in dryland wheat, respectively. Wheat crops under N210 kg ha-1 could achieve both high NUE and grain yield simultaneously with only moderate N fertilizer in South Shanxi, China.

In response, the agroforestry technology intercropping of Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.)) and Maize (Zea mays L.) was developed to complement conventional soil fertility management technologies. However, diversified information on the profitability of Gliricidia-Maize intercropping system in dryland areas is scanty. Using data from the Gliricidia and maize models of the Next Generation version of the Agriculture Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM), this study estimates the profitability of the Gliricidia-Maize system relative to an unfertilized sole maize system. Results show significant heterogeneity in profitability indicators both in absolute and relative economic terms. Aggregated over a 20-year cycle, Gliricidia-Maize intercropping exhibited a higher Net Present Value (NPV = Tsh 19,238,798.43) and Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR = 4.27) than the unfertilized sole maize system. The NPV and BCR of the latter were Tsh 10,934,669.90 and 3.59, respectively. Moreover, the returns to labour per person day in the Gliricidia-Maize system was 1.5 times those of the unfertilized sole maize system. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the profitability of the Gliricidia-Maize system is more negatively affected by the decrease in output prices than the increase in input prices. A 30% decrease in the former leads to a decrease in NPV and BCR by 38% and 30%, respectively. Despite the higher initial costs of the agroforestry establishment, the 30% increase in input prices affects more disproportionally unfertilized sole maize than the Gliricidia-Maize system in absolute economic terms, i.e., 11.1% versus 8.8% decrease in NPV. In relative economic terms, an equal magnitude of change in input prices exerts the same effect on the unfertilized sole maize and the Gliricidia-maize systems. This result implies that the monetary benefits accrued after the first year of agroforestry establishment offset the initial investment costs. The Gliricidia-Maize intercropping technology therefore is profitable with time, and it can contribute to increased household income and food security. Helping farmers to overcome initial investment costs and manage agroforestry technologies well to generate additional benefits is critical for the successful scaling of the Gliricidia-Maize intercropping technology in dryland areas of Dodoma, Tanzania.

Flooding in drylands can result in the formation of anaerobic habitats. However, little is known about the microbial metabolism of TCP in dryland soil under anaerobic conditions. Here, chlorpyrifos-contaminated dryland soil was incubated to enrich the TCP-degrading microbial consortium under anaerobic conditions. Chloridion and CO2 were released with TCP degradation, and the enrichment cultures of dryland soil could metabolize 97% of TCP (100mg/L) within 20h. Both reductive and hydrolysis dechlorination mechanisms were involved in TCP biodegradation under anaerobic conditions. Bacterial taxonomic analysis revealed that the aerobic TCP-degrading bacteria Ochrobactrum and dechlorination bacteria Delftia were the dominant genera. Anaerobic and facultative bacteria; i.e., Bacteroides, Bacillus, and Cupriavidus had lower relative abundances, but they were significantly enriched following treatment with TCP. These results indicate that the enrichment cultures of dryland soil dominated by aerobic bacteria could dechlorinate and degrade TCP under anaerobic conditions.						zhang, chen/0000-0001-7175-1424													0923-9820	1572-9729				JUN	2019	30	2-3					161	171		10.1007/s10532-019-09873-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10532-019-09873-y								30929106					WOS:000467391200005

Here, we first investigated the spatial and temporal trends of global dryland vegetation based on multiple satellite- and model-based indices, including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI), vegetation optical depth (VOD), and gross primary productivity (GPP) during 1988-2018. Then, the impacts of a set of environmental drivers (i.e. mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean annual temperature (MAT), soil moisture (SM), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD)) on vegetation dynamics were quantified using partial correlation analysis and structural equation model. All four indices increased strongly before 2000 but slowed afterward. The variation in dryland vegetation was more related to SM anomaly in comparison with other environmental drivers. The variation induced by SM was amplified by high VOD in some continents. Furthermore, MAT contributed similarly as SM to vegetation dynamics in North America. The four vegetation indices exhibited divergent responses to environmental drivers due to their characteristics. At the continental scale, NDVI was only relevant to variation in VPD in North America. In contrast to NDVI, LAI, and VOD, GPP was more closely associated with the variation in SM and VPD. Roughly half of the GPP variation was attributable to the combination of SM and MAT in North America and Australia, whereas they have low predictive power (similar to 30%) in Eurasia, Africa, and South America. SM was closely linked to the vegetation changes in grasslands and shrublands; however, this impact varied among the continents. Our results advance the current understanding of dryland vegetation dynamics and shed new light on improving dryland carbon flux simulation by fully considering the role of soil moisture.					zhao, hang/JVM-8270-2024; liu, huan/JEO-4705-2023; wang, zhuonan/HNC-5335-2023; WANG, Bin/JGM-2639-2023; chen, yan/JRY-4645-2023; Zhang, Yusi/JNS-2335-2023; liu, huan/JKI-3764-2023; Wang, Luyao/JLL-2001-2023	wang, zhuonan/0000-0002-8945-7247; Gang, Chengcheng/0000-0002-2804-5636; You, Yongfa/0000-0002-8916-2940													0168-1923	1873-2240				MAR 15	2023	331								109327	10.1016/j.agrformet.2023.109327	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2023.109327		JAN 2023											WOS:000925570800001

However, how the co-occurrence networks of soil microbial communities respond to dryland legume and non-legume plantations is unclear. Here, we conducted a comparative analysis of legume (13-, 35-, and 55-years Caragana korshinskii) and non-legume (13-and 55-years Platycladus orientalis) plantations, including plant communities, soil physicochemical properties, and soil microbial communities, in the west of the Loess Plateau, China. The results showed higher richness and diversity, more keystone taxa and positive relationships, and larger connectivity and potential functions existed in soil bacterial and fungal communities of legume plantations. Meanwhile, richer plant communities and higher soil nutrients in legume plantations were found than those in non-legume plantations. We revealed that legume plantations shaped a more complex co-occurrence network, forming a virtuous cycling of "plant soil-microbe" continuum in legume plantation ecosystems. Our results provided a new perspective on evaluating the ecological value and plantation stability of legume tree species in the vegetation restoration engineering of drylands.

Spatiotemporal evaluation based on remote sensing and SVM	LAND USE POLICY												Chinese population growth has led to an increase in the demand for grain. Thus, it is of great importance to carry out spatiotemporal assessments of the dynamic of potential cultivated land in China, especially in dryland sensitive to climate change. Considering that previous assessments conducted at large scales were often dependent on abundant indicators, which are not easy to obtain or map at high spatiotemporal resolutions, this study combined remote-sensing images and support vector machine (SVM) model to identify the dynamics of potential cultivated land and non-cultivated land in the dryland of China. First, among several vegetation indicators during the growing season, the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) in August was the most highly correlated with the yield (R2 =0.72). Second, the potential cultivated land that has not been cultivated was mainly distributed in the northwest and the northeast of the dryland of China, while the potential non-cultivated land that has been cultivated was mainly distributed in the Loess Plateau. According to different models, the area of potential non-cultivated land was 2.78 - 15.68 times that of potential cultivated land. Last, benefitting from the wetting trend, the potential cultivated land in the dryland of China expanded from 2001 to 2015. The area of potential cultivated in 2011-2015 was 34.39% more than that in 2001-2005. These findings provide both new methodological support for the simplified assessment of the potential cultivated land and quantitative evidence indicating the maximum potential capacity for cultivation in China's dryland.

Therefore, in this study, we compared the distribution patterns of abundant and rare fungi and explored the factors determining their assembly processes in a dryland montane forest in China. Stronger distance-decay relationships (DDRs) were found in abundant sub-communities than in rare sub-communities. In addition, abundant fungi exhibited greater presence and wider habitat niche breadth than rare fungi. Both the null model and variation partitioning analysis indicated that dispersal limitation and environmental selection work together to govern both abundant and rare fungal assembly, while dispersal limitation plays a dominant role. Meanwhile, the relative influence of dispersal limitation and environmental selection varied between abundant and rare sub-communities, where dispersal limitation showed greater dominance in abundant fungal assembly. Mantel tests demonstrated that soil pH and phosphorus played critical roles in mediating abundant and rare fungi assembly processes, respectively. Our findings highlight that the distinct biogeographic patterns of abundant and rare fungi are driven by different assembly mechanisms, and the assembly processes of abundant and rare fungi are determined by diverse ecological drivers in dryland montane forest soils.																				1664-302X				SEP 27	2022	13								929772	10.3389/fmicb.2022.929772	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.929772								36238586					WOS:000868284600001

However, few studies have examined the effects of different agronomic practices on the SIC content. This paper aims to study the effects of different agronomic practices on the SIC content in the 0- to 40-cm soil layer of dryland fields; the innovations are intended to explore the relative importance and synergistic effects of different agronomic practices on the SIC content of the plough layer of dryland fields. We screened out 136 peer-reviewed articles worldwide from 1990-2022, with a total of 2612 valid data pairs, using meta-analysis to assess the effects of different agronomic practices on the SIC content of the plough layer of dryland fields. Compared to conventional tillage (CT), both no-tillage (NT) and plastic film mulching (PM) were able to increase the SIC content in the 0- to 40-cm soil layer of dryland fields. NT increased the SIC content by 15.07 +/- 3.48%, while PM gradually increased SIC accumulation as the soil layer deepened, with the greatest increase in SIC content in the 30- to 40-cm soil layer at 11.61 +/- 5.89%. When organic manure application (M) and straw return mulching (SM) were applied, the SIC content in the 0- to 40-cm soil layer of dryland fields showed a non-significant reduction trend, with the largest changes in SIC content in the 0- to 10-cm soil layer, at 5.23 +/- 2% and 4.69 +/- 3.53% reductions, respectively. No-tillage straw return (NTS) significantly increased the SIC content in the 0- to 40-cm soil layer of dryland fields by 77.34 +/- 5.6%, which was significantly higher than the independent effects of NT and SM, showing a more substantial synergistic effect. Different agronomic practices have different effects on the SIC content of dryland fields in the 0- to 40-cm soil layer, with NTS > NT > PM > SM > M. Among practices, NTS, NT and PM can increase the SIC content of the plough layer of dryland fields; in particular, NTS can increase the SIC content of 0- to 40-cm in dryland fields to the greatest extent through a synergistic effect. At the same time, SM and M showed an insignificant reduction effect.

M.; Sheffield, Justin			Global sensitivity analysis of crop yield and transpiration from the FAO-AquaCrop model for dryland environments	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												The application of crop models towards improved local scale prediction and precision management requires the identification and description of the major factors influencing model performance. Such efforts are particularly important for dryland areas which face rapid population growth and increasing constraints on water supplies. In this study, a global sensitivity analysis on crop yield and transpiration was performed for 49 parameters in the FAO-AquaCrop model (version 6.0) across three dryland farming areas with different climatic conditions. The Morris screening method and the variance-based Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (EFAST) method were used to evaluate the parameter sensitivities of several staple crops (maize, soybean or winter wheat) under dry, normal and wet scenarios. Results suggest that parameter sensitivities vary with the target model output (e. g., yield, transpiration) and the wetness condition. By synthesizing parameter sensitivities under different scenarios, the key parameters affecting model performance under both high and low water stress were identified for the three crops. Overall, factors relevant to root development tended to have large impacts under high water stress, while those controlling maximum canopy cover and senescence were more influential under low water stress. Parameter sensitivities were also shown to be stage-dependent from a day-by-day analysis of canopy cover and biomass simulations. Subsequent comparison with AquaCrop version 5.0 suggests that AquaCrop version 6.0 is less sensitive to uncertainties in soil properties.

In this paper, the drought conditions for the forest and grassland areas in the northern region of China were identified based on 12 years of satellite-based Drought Severity Index (DSI) data. The impact of drought on dryland vegetation in terms of carbon use efficiency (CUE) and water use efficiency (WUE) were also investigated by exploring their correlations with DSI. Results indicated that 49.90% of forest and grassland experienced a dry trend over this period. The most severe drought occurred in 2001. In general, most forests in the study regions experienced near normal and wet conditions during the 12 year period. However, grasslands experienced a widespread drought after 2006. The forest CUE values showed a fluctuation increase from 2000 to 2011, whereas the grassland CUE remained steady over this period. In contrast, WUE increased in both forest and grassland areas due to the increasing net primary productivity (NPP) and descending evapotranspiration (ET). The CUE and WUE values of forest areas were more sensitive to droughts when compared to the values for grassland areas. The correlation analysis demonstrated that areas of DSI that showed significant correlations with CUE and WUE were 17.24 and 10.37% of the vegetated areas, respectively. Overall, the carbon and water use of dryland forests was more affected by drought than that of dryland grasslands.

Three tillage measures were implemented in 2018, namely, no-tillage during summer fallow (NTF), subsoiling during summer fallow (STF), and plough tillage during summer fallow (PTF), to investigate the changes in soil porosity in different growth periods of winter wheat and their contribution to the soil water storage. The results showed that soil total porosity (P-t) at the 0.2-0.3 m soil depth under the PTF treatment increased significantly from 5.64% to 34.72% compared with that under the STF treatment from pre-seeding to anthesis and significantly increased from 8.67% to 11.56% compared with that under the NTF treatment from pre-seeding to the overwintering stage. In the overwintering period, aeration porosity (P-a) in the 0.1-0.3 m profile under the PTF treatment increased from 31.59% to 73.98% compared with that under the NTF treatment, and that of the 0.2-0.3 m soil layer under the STF treatment increased by 82.47% compared with that under the STF treatment. At the overwintering stage and jointing stage, capillary porosity (P-c) at 0.2-0.3 m soil depth under the NTF treatment increased significantly by 17.45-17.72% compared with that under the STF treatment. The P-t and P-a of the 0-0.1 m soil layer promoted soil water storage in the 0.1-1 m soil profile, while the P-c of the 0-0.3 m soil profile was significantly negatively correlated with the gravimetric water content of the 0.1-0.6 m soil profile. In summary, compared with the NTF treatment, the PTF and STF treatments increased the soil water content and soil water storage at a depth of 0-1 m by increasing P-t and P-a.					xuan, li/JNI-7432-2023; zhou, wei/JQJ-0490-2023; chen, yan/JRY-4645-2023; peng, jy/JMB-2297-2023	peng, jy/0000-0001-9665-1059; Xue, Jian-Fu/0000-0003-4449-0569														2073-445X				JAN	2023	12	1							230	10.3390/land12010230	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land12010230													WOS:000917534600001

Selenium spraying may be an appropriate strategy for increasing crop tolerance to drought stress. The aim of this research was to evaluate supplementary irrigation and selenium spraying on the yield and water productivity of two canola cultivars under subtropical dryland conditions. The experiment was a split factorial in a randomized complete block design with three replications conducted during 2016-2018 at Gachsaran Agricultural Research Station, Iran. The main factors consisted of irrigation regimes (no irrigation (I-1), supplementary irrigation at flowering stage (I-2), grain filling (I-3) and flowering + grain filling (I-4)), and a sub-factor comprising Hyola 401 (water stress tolerant) and Delgan (less tolerant to water stress) cultivars and selenium spaying from the source of sodium selenate (Na2SeO4) (zero (S-0), 1.5 (S-1) and 3 (S-2) mg L-1). Results showed that the application of supplementary irrigation increased the yield, yield components, oil percentage, harvest index and water productivity. Selenium spraying increased the weight of 1000 seeds and grain yield. Grain yield was increased from 802 kg ha(-1) in S-0 and I-1 treatment up to 2274 kg ha(-1) in S-2 and I-4. The Delgan and Hyola harvest index rose from 19.94 % and 22.1 % in I1 to 29.13 % and 26.99 % in I-4, respectively. The highest oil percentage (37.6 %) was observed in the I-4 regime, the highest water productivity (0.67 kg m(-3)) was obtained from I-4 and S-2 treatments, and the lowest water productivity (0.34 kg m(-3)) was seen in I-1 and S-0 treatments. Generally, the results showed that high yielding canola production can be achieved through supplementary irrigation in two stages (flowering and grain filling stages) and by applying 1.5 mg L-1 selenium foliar application in subtropical dryland conditions.

J	Heritage, G; Entwistle, N; Milan, D; Tooth, S				Heritage, George; Entwistle, Neil; Milan, David; Tooth, Stephen			Quantifying and contextualising cyclone-driven, extreme flood magnitudes in bedrock-influenced dryland rivers	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES												In many drylands worldwide, rivers are subjected to episodic, extreme flood events and associated sediment stripping. These events may trigger transformations from mixed bedrock-alluvial channels characterised by high geomorphic and ecological diversity towards more dominantly bedrock channels with lower diversity. To date, hydrological and hydraulic data has tended to be limited for these bedrock-influenced dryland rivers, but recent advances in high-resolution data capture are enabling greater integration of different investigative approaches, which is helping to inform assessment of river response to changing hydroclimatic extremes. Here, we use field and remotely sensed data along with a novel 2D hydrodynamic modelling approach to estimate, for the first time, peak discharges that occurred during cyclone-driven floods in the Kruger National Park, eastern South Africa, in January 2012. We estimate peak discharges in the range of 4470-5630 m(3)s(-1) for the Sabie River (upstream catchment area 5715 km(2)) and 14,407-16,772 m(3)s(-1) for the Olifants River (upstream catchment area 53,820 km(2)). These estimates place both floods in the extreme category for each river, with the Olifants peak discharge ranking among the largest recorded or estimated for any southern African river in the last couple of hundred years. On both rivers, the floods resulted in significant changes to dryland river morphology, sediment flux and vegetation communities. Our modelling approach may be transferable to other sparsely gauged or ungauged rivers, and to sites where palaeoflood evidence is preserved. Against a backdrop of mounting evidence for global increases in hydroclimatic extremes, additional studies will help to refine our understanding of the relative and synergistic impacts of high-magnitude flood events on dryland river development.

Currently, drought and infestation by the sugarcane aphid (SCA, Melanaphis sacchari) are the two major challenges to grain sorghum production in the area. A 2-year field study was conducted to investigate the effect of planting date (PD) and hybrid selection on yield, evapotranspiration (ET), water use efficiency (WUE), and SCA infestation. Five sorghum hybrids (86P20, SP-31A15, AG1201, AG1203, and DKS37-07) were grown on two planting dates (PD1-early May; PD2-late June) under dryland conditions. Insecticides were not used. There were significant differences in grain yield, WUE, evapotranspiration (ET), and SCA population between two PDs and among hybrids. For PD1, SCA infestation occurred after sorghum reached physiological maturity in 2017. Although SCA infestation was observed during late grain filling in 2018, SCA populations were low and did not affect yield. For PD2, SCA was present before anthesis in both years and significantly affected grain yield. Even with heavy SCA infestation in PD2, the grain yield was higher in PD2 than in PD1 due to timely precipitation. Among hybrids, AG1203, 86P20 and DK37-07 performed better with higher yield and less SCA infestation in PD2. Grain yield was more related to seeds per plant than to kernel weight and harvest index.

We conducted field experiments using three nitrogen (N) fertilization levels (0, 120, and 180 kg ha(-1)) applied to eight dryland wheat cultivars to assess NUE and its associated traits. RESULTS The grain yield significantly increased with the improvement in variety, mainly as a result of a substantial increase in 1000-grain weight and harvest index. Modern wheat varieties have stabilized at an optimal plant height and exhibited improved performance in terms of NUE, partial N productivity, N harvest index, and grain protein content compared to older varieties. The NUE of wheat gradually increased with variety replacement. The net photosynthesis rate of the flag leaves in the filling stage improved with the year of cultivar release; Increasing soil-plant analysis development (SPAD) values of flag leaves in the flowering and filling stages were observed over time, with the flag leaves of modern varieties showing a high chlorophyll content in the filling stage. Additionally, the principal component analysis showed that the SPAD value, grain number per unit area, transpiration rate, leaf area, and grain protein content positively contributed to the clustering of the N180 and modern cultivars (from the 2000s to 2010s). CONCLUSION Overall, high levels of N application did not significantly improve the NUE of wheat. However, modern wheat varieties can optimize N distribution, increase flag leaf photosynthetic capacity, and improve photosynthesis ability, thus enhancing NUE to achieve high yields under a suitable level of N supply.

As the pressure on freshwater resources is growing in such environments, sustainable management of these resources is vital. Key issues need to be addressed: How does withdrawal for irrigation purposes alter a river's flow regime and water yield? How can publicly available irrigation data help to improve the performance of hydrological models? A novel irrigation module was introduced to improve the performance of a mesoscale hydrological model Water Availability in Semi-Arid environments and Sediment transport (WASA-SED) and was tested on the hydrological upper mesoscale, as well as on a smaller sub-basin in a semi-arid catchment in the Rio Sao Francisco basin. We show that including irrigation practices into the modelling process especially helps to improve the quality of the modelled low flows during the dry season, where we achieved an improvement in the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of up to 19%.

In this study, different rice production patterns were examined to quantify the effects on crop production, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and synchronization index of water conservation and GHG mitigation. The results indicated that rice direct dryland seeding with biodegradable mulching showed the best performance in maintaining yield (7,802 kg ha-1), saving irrigation water (67%), increasing net profit (619 CNY ha-1), reducing CH4 emissions (73%), global warming potential (69%) and GHG intensity (69%), although it increased N2O emissions (59%), compared with continuous flooding. Rice direct dryland seeding without mulching showed similar water savings and GHG mitigation with mulching, but it caused yield and net profit reductions by 20% and 40%, and synchronization index increment by 127%. These findings can guide the implementation of dryland rice production in priority areas, contributing to high-efficiency, eco-friendly agricultural cultivation.																			0921-3449	1879-0658				OCT	2023	197								107071	10.1016/j.resconrec.2023.107071	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2023.107071													WOS:001112309900001

However, these soils can be used to establish energy crops, using forest species specially adapted to this condition. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the potential land availability in the drylands of central Chile for establishing short rotation forestry crops, with low water consumption species. The species Acacia saligna, Atriplex nummularia, Robinia pseudoacacia, Eucalyptus rudis, Eucalyptus globulus subspecies biscotata, Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Eucalyptus occidentalis, based on characteristics such as dry biomass yield, water requirements, tolerance to frost and calorimetric properties, were evaluated. The study area corresponds to Mediterranean drylands of Maule Region in Chile, with a total area of 544 thousand hectares. The results indicate that the potential for the seven crop species considered is about 100,000 ha. It can be concluded that thousands of land hectares are potentially available for growing short rotation forestry crops in the Mediterranean drylands of central Chile.

J	Li, YP; Chen, YN; Li, Z				Li, Yupeng; Chen, Yaning; Li, Zhi			Dry/wet pattern changes in global dryland areas over the past six decades	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												As reported in previous studies, global warming has caused a clear uptick in dryland areas since the 1950s. Meanwhile, the accelerated expansion of drylands has become particularly evident over the past 40 years, with dry/wet patterns showing significant differences prior to and after 1980. This paper uses the Precipitation/Potential evaporation (P/PET) index to analyze changes occurring in the dry/wet structure of various spatial and temporal scales during 1948-2008. The results show the emergence of complex aridity changes on a regional scale. While aridity generally decreased in the drylands of Asia during 1948-2008, the change in aridity was opposite in the drylands of the American and African continents between 1948 and 1979 and 1980-2008. Specifically, drylands in the American continent showed a wetting tendency during 1948-1979 and a drying tendency during 1980-2008, whereas drylands in the African continent underwent significant drying during 1948-1979 followed by subtle wetting in 1980-2008. Even though rapid warming since the 1980s has become an increasingly important cause of the recent global drying trend, especially in East and Central Asia, the changes in aridity in the American and African drylands is attributable to natural variabilities in precipitation associated with multi-decadal surface sea temperature changes, along with large-scale circulation patterns.

Cover Crop Impacts on Water Dynamics and Yields in Dryland Wheat Systems on the Colorado Plateau	AGRONOMY-BASEL												On the semiarid Colorado Plateau, dryland farmers are challenged by degraded soils and unreliable precipitation. While cover crops have been shown to support soil fertility, control erosion, and enhance soil water capture, they also use limited soil water and, thus, may impact cash crop productivity in dryland systems. Most literature on cover crops comes from relatively humid climates, where yield penalties due to cover crops may be less pronounced. Two field trials were conducted in Southwestern Colorado to assess the short-term viability of cover crops in dryland systems in this region. The effect of cover crops on subsequent winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield ranged from a decrease of 78% to an increase of 13%, depending on the amount of cover crop biomass produced in the previous year. Cover crop biomass was inversely correlated with soil nitrate levels and soil water storage at wheat planting, which decreased by 0.39 mg kg(-1) and 10 mm, respectively, per 1000 kg ha(-1) of cover crop biomass produced. Less available soil water and immobilized N therefore appeared to contribute to wheat yield reductions. These impacts are particularly important for semiarid environments, where decomposition of residue is water-limited and soil water recharge depends on unpredictable precipitation patterns.

Wayan			Assessment of Soil Degradation Based on Soil Properties and Spatial Analysis in Dryland Farming	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Dryland farming, managed intensively, with the input of chemical fertilizers exceeding the dose threshold, can cause soil degradation. Degraded soil affects low environmental carrying capacity and soil and water conservation. Researchers conduct soil tests on agricultural land to address this issue, especially those that apply a continuous cropping system. This study aimed to examine soil properties to determine the conditions of soil degradation in dryland farming. The method integrates spatial analysis with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), field surveys, and laboratory soil samples analysis. The spatial data used to map the potential for soil degradation includes land use, slope, rainfall, and soil type. Integrating spatial and laboratory data, such as soil physical, chemical, and biological properties results in soil degradation status conditions representing the actual conditions in the field. This study found that there were three classes of soil degradation successively, namely mild, moderate, and high. There are two statuses of soil degradation, including non-degraded and light soil degradation status. The soils with a mild degree of degradation are due to the limiting factors of permeability, fractional composition, and total porosity. Some actions that can be taken include planning soil degradation prevention measures by utilizing soil degradation potential maps that have been made for areas with high soil degradation potential. For the sites with a status of soil degradation, efforts are made to start carrying out soil improvement actions in accordance with conservation principles to reduce the soil degradation that occurs. Moreover, organic matter is added to degraded and potentially degraded soils to increase the stability of soil aggregates and water-carrying capacity.																			2299-8993						2023	24	4					368	375		10.12911/22998993/161080	http://dx.doi.org/10.12911/22998993/161080													WOS:000954479400018
J	Ren, ZX; Zhao, YY; Han, S; Li, XX				Ren, Zhixing; Zhao, Yuanyuan; Han, Song; Li, Xixi			Regulatory strategies for inhibiting horizontal gene transfer of ARGs in paddy and dryland soil through computer-based methods	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have been regarded as emerging pollutants due to their potential risk of resistance. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is the main pathway for ARGs to lead to environmental threats. Therefore, the inhab-itation of ARGs' HGT can effectively inhibit ARGs' potential drug resistance risk within a single strain. In this paper, the characteristics of ARGs' HGT in paddy and dryland soils were identified and regulated by a combination of ARGs' HGT feature identification, transfer mechanism analysis and transfer process regulation. The homology modeling algorithm was used to simulate the construction of the Tn5 plasmid transposase of Escherichia coli (E. coli) for identifying ARGs' HGT characteristics. The GCG (212.617 angstrom) was thus determined as the target codon. Through integrated computer -based methods, results showed that the most important environmental disturbance factors for the HGT of ARGs in the paddy and dryland soils were rough farmyard manure/sewage irrigation and mining pollution, respectively. Under the disturbance of key environmental factors, the inhibitory effect of HGT of ARGs in paddy and dryland soil was reduced by 35.01 % and 34.74 %, respectively. Results demonstrated that the proposed theoretical mechanism and control strategies could effectively inhibit the HGT of E. coli ARGs in the soil environment.

Climatic Controls on Soil Carbon Accumulation and Loss in a Dryland Ecosystems	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Arid and semiarid ecosystems drive year-to-year variability in the strength of the terrestrial carbon (C) sink, yet there is uncertainty about how soil C gains and losses contribute to this variation. To address this knowledge gap, we embedded C-depleted soil mesocosms, containing litter or biocrust C inputs, within an in situ dryland ecosystem warming experiment. Over the course of one year, changes in microbial biomass and total soil organic C pools were monitored alongside hourly measurements of soil CO2 flux. We also developed a biogeochemical model to explore the mechanisms that gave rise to observed soil C dynamics. Field data and model simulations demonstrated that water exerted much stronger control on soil biogeochemistry than temperature, with precipitation events triggering large CO2 pulses and transport of litter- and biocrust-derived C into the soil profile. We expected leaching of organic matter would result in steady accumulation of C within the mineral soil over time. Instead, the size of the total organic C pool fluctuated throughout the year, largely in response to microbial growth: increases in the size of microbial biomass were negatively correlated with the quantity of C residing in the top 2 cm, where most biogeochemical changes were observed. Our data and models suggest that microbial responses to precipitation events trigger rapid metabolism of dissolved organic C inputs, which strongly limit accumulation of autotroph-derived C belowground. Accordingly, changes in the magnitude and/or frequency of precipitation events in this dryland ecosystem could have profound impacts on the strength of the soil C sink.

We modelled the impacts of different cover crop functional types over historical climate to predict how climate variability influences soil water and N acquisition and subsequent availability to a maize crop in a dryland farming system of subtropical Australia. Following local validation of simulation models (APSIM) with 3-site-years of field data, 70 years of crop-fallow rotations were simulated comparing conventional fallow against a diverse range of cover crops comprising monocultures and mixtures of grass vs. legume vs. brassica. Cover crops consistently reduced soil water and mineral N at maize sowing compared to conventional fallow. In dry to normal precipitation years, this induced a maize yield penalty of up to -18% relative to fallow, primarily due to reduced water availability. In wet years, increased in maize grain yield (+4%) was predicted following legume and grass-associated cover crop mixtures with concomitant reductions in N leaching and soil surface runoff of up to 40%. Cash crop yields following grass -cover crops were more stable and carried lower downside risks; multi-species (grass-legume-brassica) cover crop mixtures carried higher yield penalties and greater downside risks due to high biomass accumulation and high soil water extraction. These long-term predictions in water-limited environments indicate that increasing cover crop complexity by using mixtures with diverse functional traits can lead to a greater risk of yield losses and increased yield instability unless they are managed differently to monoculture cover crops. Therefore, for suc-cessful integration of cover crops into dryland agroecosystems, cover crops should be considered as a flexible choice grown under favourable precipitation and economic scenarios rather than for continuous fallow replacement.

We trace the evolution of market discourse in ICRISAT and ask why this discourse became so influential. The scale of commercialisation was limited, and its effect on intensification was mixed. A Green Revolution for dryland cereals in Eastern Africa may come not from improved varieties that give higher yields but that mature early and evade drought.

J	Baldauf, S; Cantón, Y; Tietjen, B				Baldauf, Selina; Canton, Yolanda; Tietjen, Britta			Biocrusts intensify water redistribution and improve water availability to dryland vegetation: insights from a spatially-explicit ecohydrological model	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Biocrusts are ecosystem engineers in drylands and structure the landscape through their ecohydrological effects. They regulate soil infiltration and evaporation but also surface water redistribution, providing important resources for vascular vegetation. Spatially-explicit ecohydrological models are useful tools to explore such ecohydrological mechanisms, but biocrusts have rarely been included in them. We contribute to closing this gap and assess how biocrusts shape spatio-temporal water fluxes and availability in a dryland landscape and how landscape hydrology is affected by climate-change induced shifts in the biocrust community. We extended the spatially-explicit, process-based ecohydrological dryland model EcoHyD by a biocrust layer which modifies water in- and outputs from the soil and affects surface runoff. The model was parameterized for a dryland hillslope in South-East Spain using field and literature data. We assessed the effect of biocrusts on landscape-scale soil moisture distribution, plant-available water and the hydrological processes behind it. To quantify the biocrust effects, we ran the model with and without biocrusts for a wet and dry year. Finally, we compared the effect of incipient and well-developed cyanobacteria- and lichen biocrusts on surface hydrology to evaluate possible paths forward if biocrust communities change due to climate change. Our model reproduced the runoff source-sink patterns typical of the landscape. The spatial differentiation of soil moisture in deeper layers matched the observed distribution of vascular vegetation. Biocrusts in the model led to higher water availability overall and in vegetated areas of the landscape and that this positive effect in part also held for a dry year. Compared to bare soil and incipient biocrusts, well-developed biocrusts protected the soil from evaporation thus preserving soil moisture despite lower infiltration while at the same time redistributing water toward downhill vegetation. Biocrust cover is vital for water redistribution and plant-available water but potential changes of biocrust composition and cover can reduce their ability of being a water source and sustaining dryland vegetation. The process-based model used in this study is a promising tool to further quantify and assess long-term scenarios of climate change and how it affects ecohydrological feedbacks that shape and stabilize dryland landscapes.

In dryland areas with large-scale deployment of solar PV infrastructure, vegetation was reported to experience drastic changes. However, the long-term dynamic changes and driving mechanisms have not been thoroughly studied yet. Quantitatively distinguishing the disturbances of climate change and PV plant deployment on vegetation change is the key to understanding the environmental impact of clean energy development and formulating adaptive ecological recovery measures. To understand this, we selected the Gonghe solar power project in northern China, one of the largest dryland PV plants in the world, as a case study. Specifically, satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and meteorological data from ground stations were used to analyze the changing patterns of vegetation growth and climatic factors. The relative contributions of climatic factors and PV plant deployment to NDVI change were quantified by multiple regression analysis. The results indicated that vegetation has increased gradually since 2000, with the rate of vegetation recovery doubled during the PV expansion period. From 2013 to 2020, climate change was the main driver of increased vegetation (56%), followed by the expansion of solar PV infrastructures (44%). Vegetation inside PV arrays increased 1.4 times faster than outside, mainly because the PV panels improve the efficiency of rainwater utilization in summer and reduce the negative impact of excessive sunlight in the growing season. In addition, vegetation management practices like grazing can further enhance carbon sequestration and create sustainable livelihood opportunities, achieving sustainable economic, social, and ecological development. The novelty of the study lies in the proposed framework to quantify the impact of solar PV programs on vegetation in dryland allowing easy interpretations of vegetation dynamics under clean energy development and climate change, which provide scientific references for clean energy planning and ecological recovery in arid areas.

No-tillage and mulching are widely regarded as practices that can minimize the disturbance of the agro-ecosystem and regulate the water cycle in dryland farming. However, detailed understanding of water and nitrate-N transport in soil and their effects on the soil ecosystem under no-tillage with mulching is lacking. To improve our understanding, a longterm continuous maize field experiment was conducted in the southern Loess Plateau, China. This article reports experimental data form a complete growth year for spring-sowing maize, including the fallow period (from October 2017 to April 2018) and the growth period (from May 2018 to September 2018) after 15 years maize planting. Treatments included conventional tillage (CT), no-tillage (NT), no-tillage with biochar (NB), no-tillage with straw mulching (NS), no-tillage with plastic film mulching (NP), and no-tillage with straw-plastic film mulching (NSP). Overall, the results revealed that the effect of different treatments on soil temperature gradually weakened with increased maize growth and increased soil depth. The NP had the highest average temperature during the whole growth period, and NS had the lowest. Average soil profile water content (SWC) and the soil water storage (SWS) of the mulching treatments (NSP, NP, NS) were higher than the non-mulching (CT, NT, NB) at each stage. The SWS of NSP in the maturity period was significantly greater by 7.1 % compared with CT. Our results indicated that there was no nitrate-N leaching in NSP and NP below 40 cm, and the nitrate-N accumulation followed the order of CT > NT > NS > NB > NP > NSP. Conventional tillage exhibited a nitrate-N accumulation peak in deep soil layers (140-180 cm), while nitrate-N peaks of the NT, NS, and NB treatments in the shallow soil layers (40-90 cm) decreased with seasonal variation. However, the NSP and NP increased yields by 36.5 % and 34.1 %, NT decreased yields by 14.8 %, respectively, compared to CT. These suggest that no-tillage alone (NT) does not effectively improve soil water use efficiency and may even reduce yields, but reduce nitrate leaching. No-tillage with straw-plastic film mulching (NSP) was the most effective measure to facilitate the sustainable development of agriculture in dryland farming.

Thus far, most research assessing the combined effects of farming systems and landscape complexity on beneficial insects has been conducted in relatively diversified and mesic systems and may not represent the large-scale, monoculture-based dryland agriculture that dominates many regions worldwide. Specifically, the effects of farming systems on forbs, bees, and their interactions are poorly understood in highly simplified dryland landscapes such as those in the Northern Great Plains, United States, an area globally important for conventional and organic small grain, pulse, forage, and oilseed production. During a 3-yr (2013-2015) study, we assessed 1) the effects of dryland no-till conventional and tilled organic farming on forbs, bees, and bee- flower networks and 2) the relationship between natural habitat and bee abundance. Flower density and richness were greater in tilled organic fields than in no-till conventional fields, and forb community composition differed between farming systems. We observed high bee diversity (109 taxa) in this highly simplified landscape, and bee abundance, richness, and community composition were similar between systems. Compared with tilled organic fields, bee-flower interactions in no-till conventional fields were poorly connected, suggesting these systems maintain relatively impoverished plant-pollinator networks. Natural habitat (11% of the landscape) did not affect small-bodied bee abundance in either farming system but positively affected large-bodied bees within 2,000 m of crop-field centers. In highly simplified agricultural landscapes, dryland organic farming and no-till conventional farming together support relatively high bee diversity, presumably because dryland organic farming enhances floral resources and bee-flower networks, and no-till management in conventional farming provides undisturbed ground-nesting habitats for wild bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea).

Taub.], is a summer legume with heat-and drought-tolerance properties that is produced in the U.S. Southern Great Plains, but is often restricted to a catch crop or substitute crop following cotton failures. This is despite the large domestic market for guar gum and the opportunity to diversify regional cropping systems with guar, potentially adding ecosystem benefits like biological N fixation (BNF). To address this, a systems research study was conducted near Chillicothe, TX from 2018 to 2021 to evaluate the integration of guar into no-till dryland winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) systems. Treatments included integrated wheat-guar systems differing in cropping intensity, 1.33 crops yr- 1 (WG1.3) and 2 crops yr- 1 (WG2), plus guar (G1) and wheat (W1) monocrop systems with 1.0 crop yr-1. Results showed that crop rotation sequence influenced sea-sonal guar yields, with negative yield impacts when guar immediately followed wheat. Consequently, the average seasonal guar yield was greatest in G1 and WG1.3 (1.01 and 0.96 Mg ha-1, respectively), followed by WG2 (0.64 Mg ha-1). Seasonal wheat yield averaged 2.31 Mg ha-1 across years, with no differences among systems. Across years, cumulative system yield was greatest for WG2, followed by W1 and WG1.3, then G1. Similarly, average annual net income followed the trend of G1 < W1 < WG1.3 < WG2, with values ranging from US$ 62.7-213.0 ha-1 year-1. Although overall production and net income were somewhat greater for WG2 than WG1.3, seasonal risks of crop failure and economic loss were lower for the WG1.3 system under the regional climate. There was no direct evidence of guar BNF benefits on subsequent wheat yield and quality, though in-clusion of guar enhanced soil NO3-N at varying levels among systems, particularly following wet growing seasons and in less intensive systems.

However, fewer than 10% of directly sown seeds transition to established seedlings. One of the potential factors restricting plant establishment in degraded soils is the low abundance and diversity of native soil micro-organisms. In this study, we investigated whether returning indigenous bacteria and cyanobacteria consortia to degraded dryland soils improved seedling emergence, survival and growth of native plants. We inoculated 'culturable whole soil' native heterotrophic bacteria and biocrust cyanobacteria individually and as a mixed inoculant into extruded pellets containing Acacia inaequilatera (Fabaceae) and Triodia epactia (Poaceae) seeds. The pellets were planted in an active minefield for 28 weeks and seedling emergence and total biomass of plants were determined. Cyanobacteria and bacteria inoculants increased the emergence of A. inaequilatera by 55% and 48%, respectively. Seedling emergence in T. epactia was increased by 20% by cyanobacteria but was not increased by bacteria. The only effect of inoculation on seedling survival or mass per surviving seedling in either species was an 11% reduction of the growth of T. epactia seedlings that were inoculated with cyanobacteria. Synthesis and applications: Our results suggest that the benefit of micro-organisms on plant establishment is both species specific and life stage specific, with particularly strong benefits in the early stages of recruitment. Our experiment was conducted under shade and with additional water, so a worthwhile future direction would be to quantify the effect of inoculation under unmodified field conditions. It would also be worthwhile monitoring the outcomes for longer than 28 weeks. Since seedling emergence is one of the critical challenges in dryland restoration, our study provides direct evidence in the use of native micro-organisms to potentially improve seedling emergence in seed-based dryland restoration.

Impact of Cover Crops and Poultry Litter on Selected Soil Properties and Yield in Dryland Soybean Production	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Soil biological properties are important for the stabilization and preservation of a good soil structure. Management practices can affect the diversity and population of microorganisms, which could beneficially change soil properties and promote a more sustainable dryland crop production. This study was established near Pontotoc, MS, USA (34 degrees 07 ' N, 88 degrees 59 ' W) on an Atwood silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Paleudalf) to evaluate the impacts of cover crops, planting dates and fertilizer sources (poultry litter, inorganic fertilizer and no fertilizer) on selected biologically related soil properties in a no-tillage, dryland soybean production. Soil analyses included total carbon and nitrogen, permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC), easily extractable glomalin-related soil protein (EE-GRSP), water stable aggregate (WSA) and soil pH. Cover crop production and soybean yield were also determined. The results indicated that the fertilizer source had an impact on total nitrogen, EE-GRSP and soybean yield. Total N was 6% higher with poultry litter at the early planting date compared to no fertilizer (control) (p < 0.0018) and at the late planting date, when total N and EE-GRSP were increased by 11% and 13%, respectively, with poultry litter compared to no fertilizer. Additionally, soil pH was reduced by 0.25 units in the poultry litter-amended treatment. Soybean yield was increased by 68% and 51% in early-planted soybean and 42% and 40% in late-planted soybean with poultry litter and inorganic fertilizer, respectively, compared to no fertilizer. This study revealed that biological soil properties and soybean yield were influenced by poultry litter application. The results showed no significant effects of cover crops over the short time period of the study.

There is a need to understand the impacts of different fertilizer application depths on crop production and gas emissions to facilitate the sustainable development of dryland agriculture. Methods A field experiment was conducted for two years (2019-2020) in a dryland agroecosystem in the Loess Plateau region of China. Five fertilizer placement depths were tested comprising 0 cm (FD0), 5 cm (FD5), 15 cm (FD15), 25 cm (FD25), and 35 cm (FD35). N-P-K fertilizer was applied to all treatments as base fertilizer at the same rate. After sowing, the gas emission fluxes were measured 17 consecutive times. We systematically analyzed the effects of different fertilization depths on the summer maize (Zhengdan 958) yield, ammonia (NH3) volatilization, and greenhouse gas emissions (nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4)). Results The results showed that the NH3 volatilization, N2O emissions, CO2 emissions, and global warming potential (GWP) decreased as the fertilization depth increased. Compared with the traditional fertilization depth (FD5), deep fertilization at 15 cm clearly reduced the NH3 volatilization, N2O emissions, CO2 emissions, GWP, and greenhouse gas intensity. In addition, compared with FD25 or FD35, FD15 increased the capacity of the soil to absorb CH4. Critically, compared with the traditional fertilization depth, FD15 can effectively improve the summer maize biomass yield (4.2%) and grain yield (18.1%) at the final harvest. Conclusion FD15 can promote the sustainable development of dryland agriculture in the Loess Plateau region of China by improving crop production and reducing gas emissions.					li, bai/JNE-1502-2023; Wang, Jiacheng/ABE-5948-2020														0032-079X	1573-5036				2022 NOV 23	2022										10.1007/s11104-022-05795-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-022-05795-6		NOV 2022											WOS:000886832000001

Remote sensing-based indices such as normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) are sensitive to biomass and nitrogen (N) variability in crop canopies. The objectives of this study were (i) to determine if proximal sensor-based NDVI readings can differentiate the yield of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes and (ii) to determine if NDVI readings can be used to classify wheat genotypes into grain yield productivity classes. This study was conducted in northeastern Colorado in 2010 and 2011. The NDVI readings were acquired weekly from March to June, during 2010 and 2011. The correlation between NDVI and grain yield was determined using Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient (r). The k-means clustering method was used to classify mean NDVI and mean grain yield into three classes. The overall accuracy between NDVI and yield classes was reported. The findings of this study show that, under dryland conditions, there is a reliable correlation between grain yield and NDVI at the early growing season, at the anthesis growth stage, and the mid-grain filling growth stage, as well as a poor association under irrigated conditions. Our results suggest that when the sensor is not saturated, i.e., NDVI < 0.9, NDVI could assess grain yield with fair accuracy. This study demonstrated the potential of using NDVI readings as a tool to differentiate and identify superior wheat genotypes.					dahal, subash/AAB-7374-2020; Khosla, Raj/HCH-4061-2022; Longchamps, Louis/AAD-8710-2022	dahal, subash/0000-0002-0548-9103; Longchamps, Louis/0000-0002-4761-6094; Naser, Mohammed/0000-0001-5122-1071														2072-4292				MAR	2020	12	5							824	10.3390/rs12050824	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12050824													WOS:000531559300079

It is usually believed that ecosystem services can be maximized only when we eliminate all human activities. However, this belief is not the case, at least in dryland ecosystems. Here, a gradient of human activity intensity was used to investigate changes in the value of ecosystem services over 30 -years of land-use change between 1990 and 2020 in the arid Sangong River watershed of northwest China. Spatial analyses were performed to determine how the value of dryland ecosystem services changed with human activity intensity. Stepwise regressions and linear programming models were also performed to examine how to optimize the value of ecosystem services (i.e., regulating services, provisioning services, supporting services, and cultural services). We found that landscapes of the Sangong River watershed became increasingly fragmented and that human activities gradually intensified, but the value of ecosystem services fluctuated rather than linearly decreasing over the past 30 years. Specifically, a unimodal relationship was observed between human activities and ecosystem services. The peak value of ecosystem services was 5799 USD ha(-1) yr(-1) under inter-mediate human activity intensity (i.e., human footprint index ranged from 0.2 to 0.4 at a scale of one). Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, population, and water consumption were the three most important driving factors of human activities and ecosystem services. Our results suggest that intermediate human activities may maximize dryland ecosystem services in long-term land-use change at the watershed scale, and highlight the importance of regulating economic development, population, and water consumption for the management of dryland ecosystem services.

The consequences of climate change for dryland biogeochemistry	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												Drylands, which cover > 40% of Earth's terrestrial surface, are dominant drivers of global biogeochemical cycling and home to more than one third of the global human population. Climate projections predict warming, drought frequency and severity, and evaporative demand will increase in drylands at faster rates than global means. As a consequence of extreme temperatures and high biological dependency on limited water availability, drylands are predicted to be exceptionally sensitive to climate change and, indeed, significant climate impacts are already being observed. However, our understanding and ability to forecast climate change effects on dryland biogeochemistry and ecosystem functions lag behind many mesic systems. To improve our capacity to forecast ecosystem change, we propose focusing on the controls and consequences of two key characteristics affecting dryland biogeochemistry: (1) high spatial and temporal heterogeneity in environmental conditions and (2) generalized resource scarcity. In addition to climate change, drylands are experiencing accelerating land-use change. Building our understanding of dryland biogeochemistry in both intact and disturbed systems will better equip us to address the interacting effects of climate change and landscape degradation. Responding to these challenges will require a diverse, globally distributed and interdisciplinary community of dryland experts united towards better understanding these vast and important ecosystems.

Deep soil moisture plays a crucial role in the regulation of seasonal water shortages, however, the distribution of soil water and its temporal variation in the deep soil profile (i.e., below 2.0 m) are usually unknown in a dryland agricultural field. A field study of three cropping systems (i.e., WWC, continuous winter wheat; SMC, continuous spring-maize; and WMR, a rotation of winter wheat and spring maize) and three tillage practices (i.e., NT, no tillage; ST, subsoiling tillage; and CT, conventional tillage) was carried out in a semiarid region, and the crop yield, vertical distribution patterns and temporal variability of the soil moisture in a 5.0 m soil profile were studied to evaluate the effect of the various management strategies on the soil water sustainability. The results indicated that the WMR and SMC systems combined with ST practice obtained higher crop yield and water use efficiency, compared to the WWC system. And the time-averaged soil moisture for the three cropping systems differed significantly (P < 0.05). The WWC system can utilize soil water below 2.0 m and caused greater soil water depletion in the 0-5.0 m soil layer. However, no significant differences in the soil water content were found among the different tillage practices. The top soil layer showed a higher index of temporal stability (ITS) value for all cropping systems, but the ITS increased with soil depth in the deep soil profile (below 3.0 m) with the WWC system. Ultimately, the most time-stable depth (MTSD) for estimating the mean soil moisture of the profile was determined to be the 2.0-3.0 soil layer for all three systems based on the ITS values, but the mechanism by which the MTSD was formed differed for the various cropping systems. The soil moisture at the MTSD under WMR and SMC had high temporal stability, and contributed to better soil water sustainability in a dryland agricultural field. These findings may provide helpful base references for evaluating the effect of different management strategies on the soil water and the temporal stability parameters of soil moisture, as well as their impact on the sustainability of the deep soil moisture in a dryland agricultural field.					yang, zhuo/JPK-3133-2023; yang, zhou/JKI-3744-2023; Wang, lili/IXD-9828-2023; Wang, Minghao/JMD-0670-2023; wang, wei/JBS-7400-2023; LI, XIAO/JCE-6169-2023; Li, Zilong/JEZ-8642-2023; Liu, Yujie/IWU-6535-2023; liu, jiaming/IWE-3196-2023; wang, xiaoyu/HJP-6901-2023; wang, yu/IUQ-6654-2023; liu, junyang/IXD-1201-2023; cao, yutong/JJF-4531-2023; Zeng, Yun/JFK-6190-2023; zhang, chen/JES-0371-2023; yuan, liping/JPK-7584-2023; liu, junyang/IXD-1252-2023; lu, yang/IWE-3635-2023	Liu, Yujie/0000-0002-1153-6156; 													0378-3774	1873-2283				OCT 1	2022	272								107834	10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107834	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107834		JUL 2022											WOS:000873153200008

Two field experiments were conducted on a group of five emmer wheat landraces (Joneghan, Zarneh, Singerd, Shahrekord, Khoygan), a durum, and a bread wheat genotype. In the first experiment, the genotypes were subjected to 30 (N-limited) and 100 kg N ha(-1) (N-supplied) at non-stress and drought stress conditions. In the second experiment, responses of these genotypes to the mentioned N supplies were studied under dryland and dryland + terminal complementary irrigation conditions. Water deprivation (being either due to the imposed drought stress or the dryland condition) led to decreases in chlorophyll concentration, maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II, relative water content, grains/spike, spikes/plant, 1000-grains weight, grain yield, plant above-ground dry mass, and N use efficiency of the examined wheat genotypes. However, emmer wheat genotypes tended to vary less in response to water supply at least in terms of a majority of the traits, including grain yield (28-30% vs 40-58% drought-induced decreases for emmer and improved wheats, respectively) and above-ground dry mass (12-17% vs 23-40% drought-induced decreases for emmer and improved wheats, respectively). Increase in N supply led to decreases in grains/spike, spikes/plant, 1000-grains weight, and grain yield of the emmer wheats, despite increases in these grain yield attributes and grain yield of the durum and bread wheats. Results were indicative of greater protein content (15.7 vs 12.4% for non-stressed emmer and improved wheats, respectively) but a smaller grain yield (2985 vs 7275 kg ha(-1) for non-stressed emmer and improved wheats, respectively), harvest index, and N use efficiency in the emmer wheats, compared to the durum and bread wheats, across different N and water supplies. Our findings were novel in that the emmer wheat was found more sustained across different water availabilities and no responsive to N levels that are beneficial to the durum and bread wheats.																			1735-6814	1735-8043				SEP	2021	15	3					391	405		10.1007/s42106-021-00143-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42106-021-00143-7		JUN 2021											WOS:000657195600001

However, the effects of long-term tillage management on allocation and dynamics of recently fixed C in the crop-soil-atmosphere system have been rarely investigated under dryland conditions. Using in-situ (CO2)-C-13 repeat labeling, this study quantified the photosynthesized C input to soil, and assessed the responses of allocation dynamics, microbial utilization, and aggregate protection of newly fixed C in three long-term (> 10y) tillage practices (no-till, chisel-till, and plow-till) in a dryland wheat cropping system. Regardless of tillage practice, the C-13 included into the shoots, roots, soil respiration, rhizosphere, and bulk soils accounted for 46-64%, 4.6-6.0%, 17-38%, 6.4-11.7%, and 2.8-7.2%, respectively, of added C-13 over a 35-d chase period. Owing to relatively low plant biomass, compared to plow-till, long-term no-till and chisel-till on average lowered plant C-13 fixation and its allocation in rhizosphere soil by 17% and 11%, and 21% and 15%, respectively. Nevertheless, the C-13 relocated to bulk soil was significantly higher under both no-till (0.24 g m(-2)) and chisel-till (0.22 g m(-2)) than that under plow-till (0.18 g m(-2)) over the chase period. This could be partially attributed to the decreased allocation of belowground C-13 to root-derived CO2 releases and the increased C retention in both macroaggregates and microaggregates in conservation tillage plots. Moreover, the reduced microbial utilization of new C in rhizosphere soil, as indicated by the low C-13 amount in microbial biomass, may further facilitate new C accumulation in bulk soil under reduced tillage. Our findings suggest that despite low photosynthetically-fixed C input to belowground pools during the early growth stages, soils under long-term conservation tillage, in particular no-till, can have a distinct efficiency advantage in soil carbon sequestration by enhancing photosynthesized C preservation in soil aggregates and decreasing new C loss from root-derived CO2 release in the dryland wheat-soil system.					mo, fei/B-5253-2018; Xiong, You-Cai/HDL-8596-2022; Mo, Fei/R-5645-2017	Xiong, You-Cai/0000-0002-4394-8331; Mo, Fei/0000-0002-7538-0453													0038-0717	1879-3428				NOV	2019	138								107581	10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.107581	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.107581													WOS:000495519900008

Consequences of Dryland Maize Planting Decisions Under Increased Seasonal Rainfall Variability	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Shifts in rainfall frequency and intensity can lead to heavy crop loss in rainfed agricultural systems. Small-scale farmers who plant with limited resources need to carefully select management strategies that are well suited for their environment. Farmers must choose between planting higher-yielding varieties that take longer to mature and lower-yielding varieties that can be harvested sooner. To better understand the interactions between rainfall variability, cultivar choice, and cropping success, we implement an ecohydrological model that accounts for variation in daily soil moisture and converts water stress to crop yield. We apply the model to growing conditions of dryland farmers in central Kenya, which is a drought-prone and semiarid region with spatially heterogeneous rainfall. To simulate stochastic daily rainfall, we derive parameters in 10-day increments from a 30+ year daily rainfall data set. We use these properties to model the stochastic seasonal water availability for cultivars with different maturation lengths. In agreement with past studies, our analysis shows that storms are becoming more intense and less frequent. We show that maize crops are prone to water deficit in the part of the growing season when crop water requirements are highest. Despite the potential for higher-yielding, late maturing varieties to improve total harvest, we find that early maturing varieties that are drought-avoidant have the lowest likelihood of failure. In light of reduced rainfall totals, we show that the historical probability of crop failure was lowest in the past and is now increasing.

As we know, land use and cover changes are strongly responsible for spatial-temporal evolutions of water resource. However, there is little explicit understanding of how spatial patterns of future dryland use will affect the water supply-demand risk. To answer this question, this study took Yulin city of China, a typical dryland region, as a case study area, and firstly estimated its 2020-2050 land use patterns under three different scenarios, covering Natural Increased Scenario (NIS), Food Security Scenario (FSS) and Economic Development Scenario (EDS), with the help of the path-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model as well as Markov-chain model. Furthermore, this study employed InVEST model to explicitly investigate spatial-temporal evolutions of water supply, water demand and water supply-demand risk in all scenarios. The estimated results indicated that the largest expanding/shrinking land use types were grasslands/croplands in NIS, croplands/ grasslands in FSS and built-up lands/croplands in EDS during 2020-2050, respectively. By 2050, all projected land use changes only slightly affected regional water supply (the fluctuation of - 5% compared to that in 2020), but greatly increased by - 57% regional water demand. Particularly, strong land use changes would likely put nearly 90% regions of Yulin city at endangered water supply-demand risk in 2020-2050. Ecological land and built-up land would easier suffer from critically endangered water supply-demand risk. In view of these modeled and analyzed results, some potential mitigation strategies of water resource utilization, such as developing waterefficient eco-agriculture, adjusting agricultural structures and enriching revegetation diversity, were suggested to coordinate future areal human-nature relationships. This study could provide some valuable information for dryland agricultural development, water-environment management and regional policy decision-making.

J	Wei, W; Pan, DL; Yang, Y				Wei, Wei; Pan, Daili; Yang, Yong			Effects of terracing measures on water retention of pinus Tabulaeformis forest in the dryland loess hilly region of China	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Terraces, which are distributed worldwide, play a key role in water conservation, vegetation restoration and agricultural production particularly in dryland mountainous environments. Due to the uncertainties caused by water balance dynamics and diverse terrace structures, different findings on the soil-water retention effects of terracing were identified across the globe. To further understand the effect of terraces on soil water retention, a field experiment was conducted between 2015 and 2019 in the dryland loess hilly region of China. The experiment compared the combination of Pinus tabulaeformis with natural slope (PS), zig terrace (PT), and fish-scale pit (PF). We found that terrace measures can greatly manipulate the hydrological dynamics and compounds. Compared with the non-terraced treatments, terrace fields reduced runoff (26.9 mm/a for PF and 34.6 mm/a for PT), increased interception (13.6 mm/a for PF and 12.1 mm/a for PT) and transpiration (14.8 mm/a for PF and 2.4 mm/a for PT) during five years of the experiment. The advantage of terracing in soil water retention was temporal, mainly during heavy rainfall periods (e.g., June to August). Zig terrace promoted soil infiltration and transpiration while fish scale pit suppressed evaporation but increased transpiration. The results indicated that temporal factor and terrace structure were essential in understanding its soil-water retention services.																			0168-1923	1873-2240				OCT 15	2021	308								108544	10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108544	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108544		JUL 2021											WOS:000692679900009

Conservation tillage (reduced tillage with residue incorporated (RT) and no-tillage with residue mulch (NT)) significantly increased SOC sequestration and soil aggregation in deep soil compared with conventional tillage with residue removal (CT). Compared with CT, RT significantly increased the proportion of small macroaggregates by 23%-81% in the 10-80 cm layer, and the OC content in small macroaggregates by 1%-58% in the 0-80 cm layer. RT significantly increased (by 24%-90%) the OC content in mineral-SOC within small macroaggregates in the 0-60 cm layer, while there was a 23%-80% increase in the 0-40 cm layer with NT. These results indicated that: (1) conservation tillage treatments are beneficial for soil aggregation and SOC sequestration in a deep soil in a dryland environment; and (2) the SOC in mineral-associated OC plays important roles in soil aggregation and SOC sequestration. In conclusion, RT with NT is recommended as an agricultural management tool in dryland soils because of its role in improving soil aggregation and SOC sequestration.

Biosolids and Tillage Practices Influence Soil Bacterial Communities in Dryland Wheat	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Class B biosolids are used in dryland wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production in eastern Washington as a source of nutrients and to increase soil organic matter, but little is known about their effects on bacterial communities and potential for harboring human pathogens. Moreover, conservation tillage is promoted to reduce erosion and soil degradation. We explored the impacts of biosolids or synthetic fertilizer in combination with traditional (conventional) or conservation tillage on soil bacterial communities. Bacterial communities were characterized from fresh biosolids, biosolid aggregates embedded in soil, and soil after a second application of biosolids using high-throughput amplicon sequencing. Biosolid application significantly affected bacterial communities, even 4 years after their application. Bacteria in the families Clostridiaceae, Norcardiaceae, Anaerolinaceae, Dietziaceae, and Planococcaceae were more abundant in fresh biosolids, biosolid aggregates, and soils treated with biosolids than in synthetically fertilized soils. Taxa identified as Turcibacter, Dietzia, Clostridiaceae, and Anaerolineaceae were highly abundant in biosolid aggregates in the soil and likely originated from the biosolids. In contrast, Oxalobacteriaceae, Streptomyceteaceae, Janthinobacterium, Pseudomonas, Kribbella, and Bacillus were rare in the fresh biosolids, but relatively abundant in biosolid aggregates in the soil, and probably originated from the soil to colonize the substrate. However, tillage had relatively minor effects on bacterial communities, with only a small number of taxa differing in relative abundance between traditional and conventional tillage. Although biosolid-associated bacteria persisted in soil, potentially pathogenic taxa were extremely rare and no toxin genes for key groups (Salmonella, Clostridium) were detectable, suggesting that although fecal contamination was apparent via indicator taxa, pathogen populations had declined to low levels. Thus, biosolid amendments had profound effects on soil bacterial communities both by introducing gut- or digester-derived bacteria and by enriching potentially beneficial indigenous soil populations.

Biochar materials can improve carbon stock and storage in these soils due to their recalcitrant organic C and protective effect on native soil carbon mineralization. A laboratory incubation experiment was conducted to study the mineralization of biochars prepared from different organic wastes after soil application and to evaluate the effect of biochars on organic C fractions in soil. A subtropical sandy loam soil (Udic Haplustalf) was collected from the University Research Farm, brought to the laboratory, processed, and pre-incubated. Five hundred grams of the soil was added to incubation jars, separately, and the following treatments were applied: (i) Control (no biochar), (ii) biochar-1 (sugarcane bagasse biochar), (iii) biochar-2 (poultry litter biochar), and (iv) biochar-3 (wheat straw biochar). Each biochar was applied at two application rates, i.e., 0.5% and 1.0% w/w maintaining three replications; moisture contents were adjusted at 50% of soil WHC, and the jars were incubated at 25 degrees C for 90 days. Maximum cumulative CO2-C evolution (Sigma CO2-C) was recorded from the soil amended with biochar-2, followed by biochar-3 and biochar-1 at 1% application rate. In the start of incubation, dehydrogenase activity (DHA) and microbial biomass C were highest in Biochar-2 amended soil whereas, at later stages of incubation, biochar-3 amended soil had highest microbial activity as compared to other two biochars. Particulate organic C and total organic C remained highest in biochar-3 amended soil throughout the incubation as compared to other two biochars. It is concluded that biochar-2 had more labile organic C with a faster rate of mineralization, while the biochar-3 had more recalcitrant organic C and thus was more effective in C storage as compared to the other two biochars.

PLASTIC FILM-MULCHING WITH APPROPRIATE SEEDING RATE ENHANCES YIELD AND WATER USE EFFICIENCY OF DRYLAND WINTER WHEAT IN LOESS PLATEAU, CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The arid and semi-arid regions of Loess Plateau in China are major winter wheat producing areas where water shortage is limiting wheat production. Present study was designed to analyzed the water consumption characteristics of plastic film-mulched wheat under different seeding rates in order to attain a high yield of dryland wheat. Wheat was sown in dryland areas of Shanxi province, China during the 2014-2016 growing seasons at different seeding rates (60, 75, 90, 105 and 120 kg h(-1)) under ridged plastic film mulching and flat sowing without mulching. The results showed that the plastic film mulching had increased the total water consumption (7.8-11%), water use efficiency (7.6%41.3%), number of tillers (8-16%), and grain yield (15.9-23.6%). Water use efficiency, water consumption, and yield were highest at 90 kg h(-1) under film mulching and 105 kg h(-1) under no mulching. Increasing seeding rate had increased the number of tillers per unit area and leaf area index, while reduced the number of grains per panicle and 1000 grains weight whereas, yield was increased first and then decreased. Therefore, film-mulching with appropriate seeding rate is an effective approach to enhance yield and water use efficiency of dryland wheat.

Compared to no-mulching (NM, control), maize yields under PFM were increased by 36.3% (2515.7 kg ha(-1)) and 23.9% (1656.1 kg ha(-1)) in the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons, respectively. The PFM improved (p < 0.01) the water use efficiency (WUE) of maize by 39.6% and 33.8% in the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons, respectively. The 2-year average NUE of maize under the PFM was 40.1, which was 30.1% greater than the NM. The average soil total N, particulate organic N, and microbial biomass N contents under the PFM soil profile were increased by 22.3%, 51.9%, and 35%, respectively, over the two growing seasons. The residual N-15 content (%TN) in soil total N pool was significantly higher (p < 0.05) under the PFM treatment. Our results suggest that PFM could increase maize productivity and sustainability of rainfed dryland faming systems by improving WUE, NUE, and soil N pools.

Therefore, before planting spring maize in the Loess Plateau region of China in 2019-2020, we applied fertilizer at soil depths of 5, 15, 25, and 35 cm (D5, D15, D25, and D35, respectively). The uptake of CH4 and diffusion flux were determined simultaneously in the soil surface and profile. We found that the dryland soil was a sink for CH4 and the cumulative CH4 uptake amount by soil without fertilization during the maize growth stage was 1.54 kg ha-1. Fertilization inhibited the uptake of CH4 by the soil, but deep fertilization promoted its uptake. The cumulative surface CH4 uptake amounts under D15, D25, and D35 were significantly higher than that under D5, i.e., by 42.4%, 105.6%, and 169.1%, respectively. The CH4 concentration and diffusion flux decreased as the soil depth increased, and CH4 diffused downward in the soil profile. The CH4 consumption rate was greater than the production rate in the 0-20 cm soil layer, whereas the opposite was found in the 20-30 cm layer. The surface CH4 uptake flux was significantly positively correlated with the diffusion flux in the 0-30 cm soil layer. Inorganic nitrogen (N) inhibited the diffusion of CH4 from the surface through the soil profile and its diffusion within the profile. The highest maize yield and biomass were obtained under D25. Therefore, increasing the fertilization depth can promote the uptake of CH4 by the soil in maize fields to alleviate climate change, and a fertilization depth of 25 cm is suitable for balancing the requirements for environmental protection and agricultural production. Our findings provide important insights into the production, consumption, diffusion, and uptake of CH4 in dryland farming areas.

Alluvial stratification styles in a large, flash-flood influenced dryland river: The Luni River, Thar Desert, north-west India	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Detailed descriptions of the architecture of dryland-river deposits are few, which hinders the understanding of stratigraphic development in aggradational settings. The aim of this study was to obtain new insight into the depositional dynamics and resultant stratigraphy of steep, high-energy dryland rivers in particular. The study site is within the Luni River, the largest river in the Thar Desert, India. A 700m wide section, 5m deep, was logged and the dated-stratification related to the flow regimen. Seasonal discharges may reach 14000m(3)sec(-1) but the bed is usually dry. The deposits consist mainly of sandy upper-stage plane bed lamination and low-angle stratification deposited in supercritical flows with some strata showing gravel-lense antidune signatures. Estimated hydraulic parameters indicate a dominance of the upper-stage plane bed state. Less frequent dune trough cross-sets occur at all depths, yet commonly as isolated sets with erosive upper boundaries. Localized deep scour causes slumping and soft-sediment deformation. Scour holes adjacent to older bedded deposits are rapidly infilled, often by massive deposits. Repeated deep scour results in units of deposition of different ages (50 to 500abp) and different facies found at similar shallow depths (2 to 3m). Older dates (1 to 2kabp) occur in lower strata (4 to 5m depths) at which depths younger units also are preserved locally. The steep, high-energy depositional environment promotes the unusual preservation and predominance of upper-stage facies, in contrast to a relative paucity of lower-stage facies. Frequent local deep-scour during floods means that specific facies rarely can be traced across the river channel for more than a few metres, but are replaced by other facies in close proximity. These results should help interpretation of high-energy sediment deposits widely and improve understanding of the stratigraphic development in modern dryland rivers, and in characterizing oil, gas and groundwater reservoirs in the dryland geological record more generally.						carling, paul/0000-0002-8976-6429													0037-0746	1365-3091				JAN	2019	66	1					102	128		10.1111/sed.12487	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sed.12487													WOS:000459578900005
J	Yang, FK; He, BL; Dong, B; Zhang, GP				Yang, Fengke; He, Baolin; Dong, Bo; Zhang, Guoping			Autumn Film Mulched Ridge Microfurrow Planting Improves Yield and Nutrient-Use Efficiency of Potatoes in Dryland Farming	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) are the most important noncereal crop in the world. Increasing potato production is critical for future global food security. China is the world's largest potato producer, and potato productivity is constrained by water scarcity and poor fertilizer use efficiency (NUEF). Recently, autumn film mulched ridge microfurrow rainwater harvesting (ARF) tillage has been successfully applied in potato production in dryland farming in Northwest China. However, the effects of ARF on the use efficiency (NUEF) of applied nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) nutrients in potatoes have not been systematically studied. A 3-year, consecutive field trial with four treatments, including moldboard planting without fertilizer application (control, CK), spring and autumn film mulched ridge microfurrow rainwater harvesting planting (SRF and ARF), and standard film mulched ridge-furrow planting (FRF), was conducted during 2018-2020. ARF greatly increased the water levels in the 0-200 cm soil profile at potato harvest compared to SRF, FRF, and CK. ARF and SRF significantly increased the levels of soil organic carbon (SOC), total and available NPK (TN, TP, TK and AN, AP, AK) compared to FRF and CK, with ARF being the most efficient at increasing the levels of the AN, AP, and AK. ARF significantly improved the soil water and nutrient activity and contributed the most to potato tuber and biomass yield and hence the NUEF. Under ARF, significant and positive associations were observed between the soil fertility traits, soil water storage (SWS), potato tuber yield, biomass yield, and NUEF. Soil fertility traits and the SWS were positively correlated with potato tuber and biomass yield. The SWS, potato tuber, and biomass yield positively correlated with the partial factor productivity (PFP) and the recovery efficiency (RE) of the applied NPK nutrients. Increased nutrient levels and their combination increased the NUEF and NUEF's components. The TN and AN contributed more significantly to the PEP and agronomic efficiency (AE) of the applied NPK nutrients; the TP was significantly positively correlated with the AE (AE(N), AE(P,) and AE(K)), while the AP was correlated with PEP (PFPN, PFPP, and PFPK) and RE (REN, REP, and REK); the TK was significantly positively correlated with the PFP and RE of the applied PK nutrients, while the AK was significantly positively correlated with the PEP, AE, and RE of the applied K nutrients. Therefore, ARF results in a synchronous increase in yield and NUEF and is the most efficient planting system for potato production in dryland farming.																				2073-4395				JUN	2023	13	6							1563	10.3390/agronomy13061563	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13061563													WOS:001013859900001

The arid nature of this area, coupled with the scarcity of surface water, poses significant challenges to economic development endeavors, particularly in agriculture and animal husbandry. The vulnerability of the natural environment, unfavorable agro-climatic conditions, and unsuitable geographical features further hamper agricultural economic activities in the Karst Mountains of Gunungkidul. This condition causes dryland farm households to be vulnerable to food insecurity. Therefore, this study attempts to investigate dryland farm households' food security in the Karst Mountain area and examine the associations of food insecurity using the share of household expenditure on food (SEF), energy intake levels, protein intake levels, and food security classification. Food security classification is specifically considered by two indicators, food expenditure proportion, and energy intake levels. The result showed that the number of family laborers, farming experience, household income, farm size, and production negatively impact the share of household expenditure on food. The average household energy consumption is sufficient, but the average protein consumption is less than others. Household food security in the Girisubo sub-district is still low since most households (70.09%) are undernourished, food vulnerable, and food insecure. Dryland farmer households need to get assistance from the local government or the private sector to grasp information about good expenditure management and food nutrition fulfillment in order to improve food security.

Whether, and how, soil organic matter (SOM) compositions contribute to the consistently low SOM storage have been puzzling. A fundamental understanding of this mechanism is particularly essential to achieve the aspiration of '4 per mille Soils for Food Security and Climate'. By screening the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM), the gatekeeper of SOM decomposition, we explored the transformation processes among the pools of SOM, DOM and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) in soils along a precipitation gradient on dryland grasslands of the Tibetan Plateau. The results revealed that the number and mean weight of DOM molecules significantly decreased, and the soil DOM composition gradually shifted to be more labile along the transition from meadow, steppe, to desert with decreasing precipitation, coinciding with the substantial reduction in SOM. Compared with meadow soils, DOM degradability increased by 8.7% in steppe soils and by 23.4% in desert soils. The ratio of soil MBC to total organic carbon was threefold higher in desert than in meadow, and positively correlated with DOM degradability, indicating that labile DOM accelerated microbial growth and SOM decomposition in desert soils. Structural equation model and correlation analyses demonstrated that the DOM degradability was primarily controlled by soil dissolved nitrogen and soil organic C and soil DOC/DN ratio.

This study at a molecular level provides a novel insight into the important role of the degradability of dissolved organic matter in carbon accumulation in dryland soils with consistently low organic matter storage. The findings will inform better global managements of soil organic matter under consideration of both food security and climate change.

J	Daramola, MT; Xu, M				Daramola, Mojolaoluwa Toluwalase; Xu, Ming			Recent changes in global dryland temperature and precipitation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Changes in dryland temperature and precipitation are essential components of dryland climate change. This study applies the use of the monthly reanalysis data product of ERA5, which has a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees, to investigate the changes in the dryland climate between 1979 and 2018. The result revealed warming and drying of the drylands in recent decades, most notably in the current decade. The general global dryland temperature and precipitation increased and decreased significantly (0.01 significance level) at the rate of 0.032 degrees C center dot year(-1) and 0.074 mm center dot month(-1)center dot year(-1), respectively, in the last 40 years. Although precipitation generally decreased over the drylands, summer precipitation increased over southern Africa and Australia as well as northern Africa and south Asia dryland areas. Variation in the warming rate over the dryland zones at different periods was also observed. The semiarid and dry subhumid warmed continually from the first decade (0.02 degrees C center dot year(-1) and 0.017 degrees C center dot year(-1)) to the fourth decade (0.077 degrees C center dot year(-1) and 0.065 degrees C center dot year(-1), respectively), while the hyperarid warmed at a slower rate in the last two decades compared to the prior decades. More intense warming was also observed in the areas where precipitation decreased, suggesting the effect of reduced evaporative cooling. These changes have implications on the dryland environment, such as aridity changes, which could affect the sustainable development of the areas through the corresponding impact on the ecosystem.

Dryland sand dunes are established Quaternary geomorphic archives, which also contain pore moisture as part of the unsaturated zone (USZ), with chemical tracers that provide a novel proxy for palaeomoisture. Chloride depth profiles, converted using a mass balance approach to temporal records, are known as hydrostratigraphies. Evaporative enrichment of meteoric chloride occurs in the near-surface zone and the established signature gets transported vertically via infiltration. This study explores the potential for this approach for southern Kalahari vegetated linear dunes comparing twelve (10-12 m deep) hydrostratigraphies across space and sampled in different years (2011, 2013, and 2016). Three further profiles sampled close to an interdune pan demonstrate that additional chloride is added locally to the dune closest to the pan. The remaining hydrostratigraphies show variable trends, with four broad groupings, leading us to suggest this region is unsuitable for this approach. Insights into this variable behavior were sought from simulating liquid and vapor flux using STEMMUS (Simultaneous Transfer of Energy, Mass and Momentum in Unsaturated Soil). Simulations suggest the mixing zone can reach 10 m thick, which helps account for the variation in hydrostratigraphies. Heterogeneity may also arise from spatially-heterogenous receipt of convective rainfall events and non-uniform vegetation cover. Furthermore, the vegetated nature of the landscape leads to less uniform moisture movement within the dune sands. We call for future applications to include site-specific insights into moisture dynamics.					zeng, yijian/C-1207-2008; van der Ploeg, Martine/B-6121-2014	zeng, yijian/0000-0002-2166-5314; Stone, Abi/0000-0001-9126-7779; van der Ploeg, Martine/0000-0002-3172-7339														2296-6463				OCT 26	2022	10								1034671	10.3389/feart.2022.1034671	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2022.1034671													WOS:000882616300001
J	Huang, Z; Dunkerley, D; López-Vicente, M; Wu, GL				Huang, Ze; Dunkerley, David; Lopez-Vicente, Manuel; Wu, Gao-Lin			Trade-offs of dryland forage production and soil water consumption in a semi-arid area	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Drought-tolerant forage crops have huge development potential in drylands taking into account the current global challenges (climate change, natural resources overexploitation and increasing food demand). However, little is known about the trade-off among yield, nutritional quality, and soil water consumption for dryland forage farming production in semi-arid regions. This research compared the two-year yield and soil water consumption characteristics of sweet sorghum (Sorghum dochna), sudangrass (Sorghum sudanense) and forage maize (Zea mays) under natural rainfall condition. The soil water content up to 200 cm soil depth -at 10-cm intervals- and dry matter yield of the different forage crops were evaluated in a set of plots in 2017 and 2018, and the nutritional quality of these crops were measured in 2018. Three replicate plots were established for each forage crop. Results showed that the neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) contents of sudangrass were significantly lower than those of sweet sorghum and forage maize (P < 0.05). Sudangrass presented the higher in vitro dry matter digestibility coefficient (IVDMD). The yield of sweet sorghum was significantly higher than that of sudangrass and forage maize. Different soil water consumption patterns were observed among the forage crops, happening mostly in the 0-150 cm soil layer in the forage maize plots, and in the 0-100 cm soil layer in the sweet sorghum and sudangrass plots. The average daily evapotranspiration (ETd) of forage maize was about 10 % and 15 % higher than that of sweet sorghum and sudangrass, respectively. Forage sorghum presented the highest yield, less soil water consumption, and similar nutritional quality to forage maize, and thus, it is an advisable option for forage production in the soil water-limited semi-arid regions.

Multi-season imagery has been shown to improve the classification of vegetation communities though the contribution of the winter season in multi-seasonal classifications remains to be assessed. The capability of multi-season images of RapidEye, a new generation high spatial resolution (5 m) space-borne sensor containing an additional red-edge band, was evaluated for the classification of several wetland and dryland communities. RapidEye images were obtained for four seasons (winter, spring, summer and autumn) between 2011 and 2012 for a subtropical coastal region of South Africa. The separability of nine wetland and dryland communities was assessed for each season using the Partial Least Square Random Forest (PLS-RF) algorithm. The four-seasons approach yielded a higher overall classification accuracy (OA = 86 +/- 2.8%) when compared to using any single-season classification. The highest single-season accuracies were obtained in spring (80 +/- 2.9%), summer (80 +/- 3.1%), and autumn (79 +/- 3.4%) compared to the winter (66 +/- 3.1%). A three-season combination of autumn, winter and spring yielded the highest average OA (86 +/- 3.1%), maximised the user's accuracies and minimised the number of comparable pairs confused. The inclusion of indices in the classification scenarios showed a minor (+/- 1 percentage points) difference in the average overall and user's accuracies compared to the classification results where only bands were used. The red-edge band of RapidEye increased the overall and average user's accuracy for most of the scenarios by 2-6 percentage points and thus contributed to the separability of communities which are dominated by evergreen tree species.

J	Pearson, MR; Reid, MA; Miller, C; Ryder, D				Pearson, Marita R.; Reid, Michael A.; Miller, Cara; Ryder, Darren			Comparison of historical and modern river surveys reveal changes to waterhole characteristics in an Australian dryland river	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Human activities are known to impact the physical template of river channels. These impacts can result from-deliberate, direct modifications as well as via indirect processes linked to broadscale landscape change. This study examined changes in the physical template of the Barwon-Darling River, a dryland river in southeastern Australia. Historical longitudinal profiles from the late 1800s were compared with contemporary profiles derived from high-definition, side scanning sonar. Comparisons focused on characterising waterhole features as they are a critical biophysical component of dryland rivers. The use of historical data presented several challenges related to small sample size and suspected sampling bias in the historical survey. However, this study demonstrates that these issues are not insurmountable providing the limitations and uncertainties with the data are acknowledged and data analyses are limited to parameters that can distinguish genuine landscape change. The findings revealed a dramatic change in the physical template of the Barwon-Darling River over a 120-yr period. Waterhole depths and distances between waterholes have been altered significantly. The magnitude and trajectory of change was found to be scale-dependent, with the greatest observable change aligned with the presence or absence of low-level weirs. Waterholes influenced by low-level weirs have increased in depth because of localised impoundment, whilst the distance between deep waterholes (>4 m in depth) has declined substantially. In contrast, the maximum depths of waterholes located outside the influence of weir pools has declined by 1.6 m and the distance between deep waterholes has more than doubled in several reaches. These declines are likely to be caused by sediment accumulation in waterholes associated with anthropogenic increases in sediment flux and a decline in the river's capacity to entrain and transport sediment throughout the system.

J	Zhang, CC; Yang, YT; Yang, DW; Wu, XC				Zhang, Cicheng; Yang, Yuting; Yang, Dawen; Wu, Xiuchen			Multidimensional assessment of global dryland changes under future warming in climate projections	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Drylands are the homes to over one-third of the world's population, and are vulnerable to anthropogenic climate change. Based on climate projections, recent studies reported a substantial expansion of global drylands in the coming decades and attributed that expansion to future warming. However, the expansion of drylands contradicts a widespread vegetation greening and a slight runoff increase in dryland ecosystems in the same climate models. Here we re-examine changes in global drylands for the coming century and at two future warming targets (1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C warming relative to the preindustrial level) based on outputs of climate models who participated in the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). In addition to aridity index (AI) that has been widely used to measure the atmospheric aridity, we also assess changes in drylands from the hydrologic and agro-ecological perspectives, using runoff (Q) and leaf area index (LAI) as indicators, respectively. Our results show that when the impact of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) on vegetation water consumption is considered in the estimation of potential evapotranspiration (E-P) and AI, the expansion of atmospheric drylands is at a much slower rate (similar to 0.16% per decade under RCP4.5 and similar to 0.30% per decade under RCP8.5) than previously reported. Moreover, the additional 0.5 degrees C warming does not lead to an evident further expansion of atmospheric drylands. In terms of hydrologic and agro-ecological drylands, both of them show significant shrinks over the coming decades, suggesting reduced hydrologic and agro-ecological aridity in the region. Finally, contrasting with previous perceptions, our results demonstrate that warming only plays a minor role in altering global drylands from all three perspectives. Increases in net radiation are primarily responsible for the expansion of atmospheric drylands, and increases in P and [CO2]-induced increases in vegetation water use efficiency are the key drivers of changes in hydrologic and agro-ecological drylands.					zhou, yang/JED-3951-2023; Zhang, Cicheng/JKI-5065-2023; Wang, Minghao/JMD-0670-2023; Li, YiXue/JRW-6306-2023; yang, yuting/HTT-2479-2023; yang, yuting/Y-7885-2018	yang, yuting/0000-0002-4573-1929; WU, Xiuchen/0000-0003-0396-7439													0022-1694	1879-2707				JAN	2021	592								125618	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125618	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125618													WOS:000639844900019

In response to the declining soil fertility, extensive participatory research has been undertaken by the World Agroforestry (ICRAF) and smallholder farmers in Dodoma region, Tanzania. The research has, amongst others, led to the development of Gliricidia agroforestry technology. The positive impact of Gliricidia intercropping on crop yields has been established. However, information on farmers' willingness and ability to adopt the Gliricidia agroforestry technology on their farms is limited. This study predicts the adoption of Gliricidia agroforestry and conventional mineral fertilizer use technology. Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were conducted with groups of farmers, purposively selected based on five sets of criteria: (i) at least 2 years of experience in either trying or using Gliricidia agroforestry technology, (ii) at least 1 year of experience in either trying or using the mineral fertilizer technology (iii) at least 10 years of living in the study villages, (iv) the age of 18 years and above, and (v) sex. The Adoption and Diffusion Outcome Prediction Tool (ADOPT) was used to predict the peak adoption levels and the respective time in years. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the effect of change in adoption variables on predicted peak adoption levels and time to peak adoption. The results revealed variations in peak adoption levels with Gliricidia agroforestry technology exhibiting the highest peak of 67.6% in 12 years, and that the most influential variable to the peak adoption is the upfront cost of investing in Gliricidia agroforestry and fertilizer technologies. However, in Gliricidia agroforestry technology most production costs are incurred in the first year of project establishment but impact the long term biophysical and economic benefits. Moreover, farmers practicing agroforestry technology accrue environmental benefits, such as soil erosion control. Based on the results, it is plausible to argue that Gliricidia agroforestry technology has a high adoption potential and its adoption is influenced by investment costs. We recommend two actions to attract smallholder farmers investing in agroforestry technologies. First, enhancing farmers' access to inputs at affordable prices. Second, raising farmers' awareness of the long-term environmental benefits of Gliricidia agroforestry technology.

Vegetation restoration in drylands adopted to prevent land degradation, and may also serve as a carbon sink in the earlier stage. However, the persistence of the carbon sink for the revegetated ecosystem in drylands is still unknown. Can the well-established restoration vegetation in dryland areas serve as a carbon sink in long-run? To address this question, we investigated the carbon sequestration capacity of planted vegetation in dryland areas with 13 years of observation (2009-2021) for established vegetation restoration, which began in 1989. We found that the revegetation area serves as a carbon sink in all years. The mean annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP) is 91.61 +/- 36.17 gC m(-2) yr(-1) (mean +/- standard deviation). Annual NEP showed a significant increasing trend over the study period with a rate of 5.65 gC m(-2) yr(-1) yr(-1) (p < 0.05). The increase in spring temperature, the earlier start of net carbon uptake and the longer duration of net carbon uptake contribute to the gradual trend of NEP. The amount of annual NEP is predominantly determined by summer precipitation. Meanwhile, our results revealed that the increase in net carbon uptake by revegetation did not lead to excessive consumption of water resources. Our results have suggested that appropriate vegetation restoration in arid areas can increase ecosystem carbon sequestration over longer timescales and mitigate climate change, with relatively low environmental consequences and risks. Considering the vast area of degraded land in the global drylands, the carbon sequestration effect of this model should be given more attention.																			1085-3278	1099-145X				2023 SEP 4	2023										10.1002/ldr.4900	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4900		SEP 2023											WOS:001060837900001

Improving above ground biomass estimates of Southern Africa dryland forests by combining Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Having the ability to make accurate assessments of above ground biomass (AGB) at high spatial resolution is invaluable for the management of dryland forest resources in areas at risk from deforestation, forest degradation pressure and climate change impacts. This study reports on the use of satellite-based synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral imagery for estimating AGB by correlating satellite observations with ground truth data collected on forest plots from dryland forests in the Chobe National Park, Botswana. We undertook nineteen quantitative experiments with Sentinel-1 (S1), and Sentinel-2 (S2) and tested simple and multivariate regression including parametric (linear) and non-parametric (random forests) algorithms, to explore the optimal approaches for AGB estimation. The largest AGB value of 145 Mg/ha was found in northern Chobe while a large part of the study area (85%) is characterized by low AGB values (< 80 Mg/ha), with an average estimated at 51 Mg/ha. The results show that the AGB estimated using SAR backscatter values from vertical transmit receive (VV) polari-zation is more accurate than that based on horizontal receive (VH) polarization, accounting for 58% of the variance compared to 32%. Nevertheless, the combination of S1 SAR and S2 multispectral image data produced the best fit to the ground observations for dryland forests explaining 83% of the variance with an accuracy of 89%. Furthermore, the optimal AGB model performance was achieved with a random forest (RF) regression trees algorithm using S1 (SAR) and S2 (multispectral) image data (R2 = 0.95; RMSE = 0.25 Mg/ha). From the 11 vegetation indices tested, GNDVI, Normalized Difference Red Edge (NDRE1), and NDVI obtained the highest linear relationship with AGB (R2 = 0.71 and R2 = 0.56, p < 0.001), however, GNDVI and NDRE1 improved the AGB estimation at medium to high-density forests compared to NDVI. The GRVI and EVI were the least correlated with AGB (R2 = 0.09 and R2 = 0.31) at a significance level of p < 0.001, respectively. We show that NDVI saturates in areas with >80 Mg/ha AGB, whereas the inclusion of SAR backscatter and optical red edge bands (B5) significantly reduces saturation effects in areas of high biomass. GNDVI and red edge (B5) derived vege-tation indices have more potential for estimating AGB in dryland forests than NDVI. Our results demonstrate that dryland AGB can be estimated with a reasonable level of precision from open access Earth observation data using multivariate random forest regression.

Whether or not RFFM can replace the conventional flat planting pattern (FP) with supplemental irrigation in dryland farming has not been tested. Moreover, the effects of reducing irrigation frequency and amount on crops in dryland farms under different rainfall years (dry, normal or wet years) remain unknown. Present study selected winter rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) as a test crop for a three-year field experiment to investigate the irrigation water-saving potential of RFFM. Six treatments: 1) FP without irrigation (FPO); 2) FP with 30-mm irrigation at the overwintering stage (FP1); 3) FP with 30- and 60-mm irrigation at the overwintering and stem-elongation stages, respectively (FP2); 4) FP with 30-, 60- and 60-mm irrigation at the overwintering, stem-elongation and flowering stages, respectively (FP3); 5) RFFM without irrigation (RFFM0); and 6) RFFM with 45-mm irrigation at the flowering stage (RFFM1) were conducted to explore their effects on root and shoot biomass, nutrient uptake, yield, oil production, evapotranspiration (ET) and water use efficiency (WUE). The results indicated that RFFM0 significantly promoted root and shoot biomass accumulation and nutrient uptake. Thus it significantly improved yield by 23.7-39.0%, oil production by 26.8-43.3% and WUE by 71.3-86.5%, and simultaneously decreased ET by 21.2-29.7% in comparison to FPO and FP1 in dry, normal and wet years. Furthermore, the yield-increasing effect in RFFMO was nearly equal to FP3 in the normal rainfall and wet years, and was equivalent to FP2 in the dry year. Yield and oil production in RFFM1 were significantly higher than in RFFM0, and were commensurate with those in FP3 in the dry year. Therefore, RFFM reduced a two-time application with total 90 mm irrigation water in a dry year, as well as a three-time application with total 150 mm irrigation water in normal rainfall and wet years for dryland winter rapeseed. Overall, RFFM is a promising adaptive agronomic strategy to apply in dryland regions to sustain food security, and cope with water scarcity, a potential threat to dryland farming due to climate change.					chen, peng/HMD-1278-2023; fang, heng/JJE-7501-2023	fang, heng/0000-0002-4493-0926													0168-1923	1873-2240				MAR 15	2019	266						119	128		10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.12.009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.12.009													WOS:000458468200012

However, the layered characteristics of water storage and their correlations with yield formation under each tillage were less investigated across several years. A randomized complete block design was conducted to investigate the effects of three tillage practices (NT, no-tillage; SS, subsoiling; DP, deep plowing) on soil water storage (SWS), yield structure, precipitation use efficiency (PUE), water use efficiency (WUE) and grain quality of dryland wheat for three consecutive years. The use of SS and DP increased SWS of 0-200 cm soil depths by 3.1% and 7.9% compared with NT over the 3 years. Subsoiling was more favorable for SWS in the 100-200 cm sublayer, while DP strongly increased the effect on the 0-100 cm upper layer. The grain yields, PUEs and WUEs under SS and DP were greater than those in NT. Grain yield had great correlation with SWS0-100cm.

Although the influence of climate, soil properties, and soil management on the SOC content has been extensively explored, their relative importance remains unclear, especially under dryland farming. Herein, we investigated the SOC density (SOCD) at different depths (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, and 30-40 cm) across an area of 37.79 x 10(4) km(2) (420 sites) located in the dryland farming regions of Northeast and North China. The total SOC storage (SOCS) was estimated to be 1922.38 Tg, with a mean density of 5.78 kg C m(-2) for the entire area. The three soil groups with the largest SOCS were Fluvo-aquic, Black, and Chernozem soils, accounting for 63.34% of the total SOCS in the study area. Overall, both the SOCD and SOCS increased from southwest to northeast at all investigated depths. A structural equation model was used to distinguish direct from indirect effects of different factors on SOCD. Soil properties (e.g., bulk density and pH) and natural conditions (e. g., mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation) were found to be the main factors controlling the SOCD variation at depths of 10-20, 20-30, and 30-40 cm. However, the total (direct and indirect) effect of soil management on SOCD at a 0-10 cm depth was greater than that of natural conditions, and smaller than that of soil properties. With increasing soil depth, the total effect of natural conditions on SOCD changed from -0.33 to -0.58, whereas the indirect effect of soil management decreased from 0.47 to 0. These results indicate that compared with environmental factors, soil management practices such as tillage and fertilization had a greater influence on SOCD in the surface soil of dryland. Our study provides a valuable reference for future research on the long-term evolution of SOC in dryland farming regions.

Soil test-based addition of deficient micro- and macronutrients increased food grain production by 30-40% and straw (which is used as fodder) production by 10-30%. Micro-watershed scale low-cost cement-lined farm-ponds at smallholder farm level proved a scalable technology for drought-proofing of crops resulting into additional crop yield by more than 30% during 2015. Augmentation of water sources also facilitated farmers' to successfully diversify the production system. Shared machinery resources improved the operational and economic efficiency of farm sowing operations through higher crop yields by around 10%. We conclude that a mix of low-cost critical interventions if out-scaled in a large number of dryland small holdings through policy support may not only improve productivity and livelihoods, but also enhance their abilities to effectively cope with the climatic aberrations.

Influence of Organic Residue Recycling on Crop Yield, Nutrient Uptake, and Microbial and Nutrient Status of <i>rabi</i> Sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor L</i>.) under Dryland Condition	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS												The field experiment was conducted on black soil (Vertic Ustropept) at Zonal Agricultural Research Station farm, Solapur, for successive 30 years from 1987-1988 to 2016-2017 under dryland condition in a randomized block design with 10 treatments and 3 replications. The pooled results of seven years (2010-2011 to 2016-2017) revealed that the application of 25 kg N ha(-1) through crop residue (CR, byre waste) along with 25 kg N ha(-1) through Leucaena lopping (Leucaena leucocephala) to rabi sorghum gave significantly higher grain and stover yield and Sustainable Yield Index (14.61 and 36.11 q ha(-1) and 0.47, respectively) which was on par with T-7, where 25 kg N ha(-1) through farmyard manure (FYM) + 25 kg N ha(-1) through urea was applied for grain and stover yield (13.95 and 34.46 q ha(-1) and 0.44, respectively). The gross and net monetary returns and benefit-cost ratio were also influenced significantly due to integrated nitrogen management (Rs. 59,796, Rs. 47,353 ha(-1), and 3.13, respectively). This was also reflected in residual soil fertility status of soil after harvest of rabi sorghum. The organic carbon content and available nitrogen content of soil, as well as nitrogen uptake and moisture use efficiency for grain, were also increased. The total microbial count of bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes was more where FYM or CR addition was done. The count of N fixers and P solubilizers was more under Leucaena application either alone or with CR or urea. Application of CR at 4.8 t ha(-1) (25 kg N ha(-1)) along with Leucaena lopping at 3.5 t ha(-1) (25 kg N ha(-1)) as green leaf manure is the best alternative organic source for fertilizer urea (50 kg N ha(-1)) to increase the production of dryland rabi sorghum.																			0010-3624	1532-2416				FEB 21	2019	50	4					435	443		10.1080/00103624.2019.1566467	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2019.1566467													WOS:000460391400006
J	He, D; Wang, EL				He, Di; Wang, Enli			On the relation between soil water holding capacity and dryland crop productivity	GEODERMA												Plant available water holding capacity (PAWC) influences the efficiency of rainfall used by crops and consequently crop productivity in dryland cropping systems. However, how soil PAWC interacts with rainfall to determine crop yield has not been quantified systematically. In this study, we used an agricultural production systems model (APSIM) and wheat as an example to quantify crop growth and yield in response to a wide range of soil PAWCs. Results show that wheat yield increased with soil PAWCs following a negative exponential curve. There is a critical PAWC above which PAWC has no impact. A summary model incorporating the impact of soil PAWC, annual rainfall and the fraction of rainfall during growing season together could explain over 95% variations in long-term averaged wheat yield. The results and the summary model provide the scientific basis to systematically explain crop yield variation in response to soil PAWC change across contrasting climates.

As a highly urbanized country, visits to the country's dryland forests constitute an important national pastime across ethnic lines. We evaluated the impact that forest visitation had on the attitudes and perspectives of the visitors. A strong correlation was found between the frequency of visits to forests by individuals and a range of pro-environmental and pro-conservation sentiments. Of particular interest was the response of Israel's Arab citizens. Not only do Israeli Arabs visit forests more frequently, but they also support environmental policy positions more avidly than do Jewish citizens. The article argues that increasing accessibility to forests and natural sites by expanding public transportation lines should constitute an important component in conservation strategies.

Optimizing Dryland Crop Management to Regional Climate. Part II: U.S. Southern High Plains Grain Sorghum Production	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS												Sorghum's heat and drought tolerance make it, together with upland cotton, one of two crops produced profitably under dryland conditions in the U.S. Southern High Plains (SHP). Here, a simulation-based method evaluates management options that increase median (50th percentile) SHP dryland sorghum yields and estimates those practice's yield risk effects. This method generates climate-representative distributions of grain yields via a crop model driven by weather inputs from 21 SHP weather stations during 2005-2016. Optimal management practices for current SHP climate conditions were sought by generating yield distributions under 32 management options defined by four planting dates, four plant densities, and applied or no applied N. The highest median grain yields resulted from management options with the latest planting date (July 5) and the lowest plant density (24.7 K plants ha(-1)), while applied N had essentially no yield effect. Increased yields with later planting dates are consistent with sorghum's growth cycle and SHP summer rainfall climatology. Confirming the low plant density yield effect may require additional field studies, as supporting evidence of higher yields at lower densities from other SHP field and modeling studies is inconclusive. These crop simulations, however, suggest late June to early July planting as part of management practices that maximize yields in dryland SHP sorghum production.

An erosional low-gradient sequence-bounding pediment surface was created basinward of a structurally controlled, transpressive piedmont junction. A thin mantle of debris flow dominated colluvium comprising the Abercyfor Formation was deposited proximal to a lowstand delta shoreline 90 km to the east and south. Temeside Mudstone Formation coastal plain deposits developed behind the delta passing westward into range front, dryland red bed alluvium of the Moor Cliffs Formation. This embryonic mudstone-dominated alluvial plain aggraded during an interval of enhanced accommodation space development. Muds were liberated from their Lower Palaeozoic bedrock provenance within and to the north of the piedmont junction. Dryland alluvial sandstone channels possibly represent stream capture events associated with hinterland drainage reorganisation. The latter promoted continued headward erosion and enlargement of the catchment area. Basinwide incision (to a depth of approximately 60 m) of the alluvial plain occurred in the mid Pridoli, with valley locations being structurally controlled. Subsequent fills preserve the middle reaches of a simple incised valley system. Lowstand to early transgressive streamflow conglomerates of the Freshwater East Formation were deposited, with sediment transport to the SE. Valley drainage was defeated by neotectonic uplift of the Orielton Anticlinorium in downstream valley reaches leading to drainage reorganisation. Accommodation space was developed at structural tip points where maximum rates of marine transgression ensued preserving backstepping parasequences of a wave dominated estuary. Localised debritic alluvial fans were shed below the interval of maximum flooding. Continued dryland sedimentation led to highstand filling and subsequent basinwide alluvial regression which continued into the late Pridoll. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We used 6 years of data from two adjacent eddy covariance sites in the Sonoran Desert, a species-rich woody C-3 native shrubland and a species-poor C-4 shrubland converted to buffelgrass savanna. Although emphasis has been given to the physical determinants of productivity in dryland ecosystems, we assessed how PFTs changes influenced (1) water and C fluxes and (2) water-use (WUEe) and intrinsic C-use efficiencies (CUEei) in the two sites under the same climatological conditions. We hypothesized that changes in PFTs would alter accessibility, rate and use efficiencies of water and carbon, with poorly known effects on the long-term fluxes and efficiencies. Annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP) in the shrubland was a C-source in drier years and a sink in others. However, longer C uptake, greater WUEe and lower CUEei were the crucial drivers for higher and positive NEP (C sink) in the savanna. Annual and seasonal WUEe and CUEei discrepancies indicated the importance of dominant PFTs after disturbance and ecohydrological feedbacks. As the world becomes drier and vegetation disturbance more common, the role of PFT changes should contribute to gaining a clearer understanding of their role in the C and water fluxes of dryland ecosystems.

The standard method of assessing pasture mass requires great effort and expense to collect enough samples to accurately represent a pasture. This work presents the results of a long-term study to calibrate a Grassmaster II capacitance probe to estimate pasture productivity in two phases: (i) the calibration phase (2007-2018), which included measurements in 1411 sampling points in three parcels; and (ii) the validation phase (2019), which included measurements in 216 sampling points in eight parcels. A regression analysis was performed between the capacitance (CMR) measured by the probe and values of pasture green matter and dry matter (respectively, GM and DM, in kg ha(-1)). The results showed significant correlations between GM and CMR and between DM and CMR, especially in the early stages of pasture growth cycle. The analysis of the data grouped by classes of pasture moisture content (PMC) shows higher correlation coefficients for PMC content >80% (r = 0.775; p < 0.01; RMSE = 4806 kg ha(-1) and CVRMSE = 28.1% for GM; r = 0.750; p < 0.01; RMSE = 763 kg ha(-1) and CVRMSE = 29.7% for DM), with a clear tendency for the accuracy to decrease when the pasture vegetative cycle advances and, consequently, the PMC decreases. The validation of calibration equations when PMC > 80% showed a good approximation between GM or DM measured and GM or DM predicted (r = 0.959; p < 0.01; RMSE = 3191 kg ha(-1); CVRMSE = 23.6% for GM; r = 0.953; p <0.01; RMSE = 647 kg ha(-1) and CVRMSE = 27.3% for DM). It can be concluded that (i) the capacitance probe is an expedient tool that can enable the farm manager to estimate pasture productivity with acceptable accuracy and support the decision-making process in the management of dryland pastures; (ii) the more favorable period for the use of this probe in dryland pastures in a Mediterranean climate, such as the Portuguese Alentejo, coincides with the end of winter and beginning of spring (February-March), corresponding to PMC > 80%.

Biological soil crusts (bio-crusts) are the communities of living organisms on the soil surface which play an important role in soil ecosystem services in arid land. Lichens are known as organisms that can accumulate certain elements or substances at high concentrations in the atmosphere. The relation between lichens species and soil geochemistry as well as dust capture in geomorphic zones in northeastern Iran were studied. Different lichens species and soil particles were analyzed by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDS). The results of XRF and XRD analysis showed lichen crusts affected soil mineralisation.

The main goal of this study was to evaluate the response of various SOC and nitrogen (N) components in semiarid cropping systems transitioning from limited-irrigation to dryland and a restored grassland in the Southern High Plains of USA. Cropping systems evaluated include dryland winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.)-fallow with conventional tillage (DLCTF) and no-tillage (DLNTF), limited-irrigation winter wheat-sorghum-fallow with no-tillage and cover cropping (LINTC) and no-tillage fallow (LINTF), and an undisturbed grassland (NG). Soil samples were collected from 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm depths and analyzed for SOC, total N, inorganic N, and soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) contents. The CO2 and N2O release during a eight-weeks long laboratory incubation were also analyzed. Results show 14% and 13% reduction in SOC and total N from 0-30 cm depth with the transition from limitedirrigation to dryland cropping systems while 51% more SOC and 41% more totalNwith the transition to grassland. The SMBC was 42% less in dryland cropping systems and 100% more inNGthan the limited-irrigation cropping systems. However, the grassland was N limited, with 93% less inorganic N in NG compared to only 11% less in dryland cropping systems than in limited-irrigation cropping systems. The microbial respiration measured as CO2-C was highest in NG, followed by limited-irrigation and dryland cropping systems. The N2O-N release showed the lowest rate of N loss from dryland cropping systems, followed by NG and limited-irrigation cropping systems. This study demonstrated loss of SOC and N in agroecosystems transitioned to dryland crop-fallow systems, with greater magnitude of change observed in the biologically active fraction of soil organic matter. Grassland restoration could be an important strategy to increase SOC and nutrients in hot, dry, semiarid agroecosystems transitioning to dryland.																			2167-8359					OCT 20	2020	8								e10199	10.7717/peerj.10199	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.10199								33150087					WOS:000580336800013

Focused groundwater recharge in a tropical dryland: Empirical evidence from central, semi-arid Tanzania	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Little Kinyasungwe Catchment within the River Wami Basin of central, semi-arid Tanzania. Study focus: Groundwater and its replenishment via recharge are critical to sustaining livelihoods and poverty alleviation in tropical drylands yet the processes by which groundwater is replenished remain inadequately observed and resolved. Detailed observations are examined from central Tanzania, where the Makutapora Wellfield supplies freshwater to the rapidly growing, capital city of Dodoma. New hydrological insights for the region: The prominence of focused recharge from ephemeral stream discharges is shown from: (1) groundwater recharge correlates more strongly with the seasonal duration of ephemeral stream stage exceeding a threshold than seasonal rainfall; (2) hourly monitoring of groundwater-levels and stream stage shows that sustained groundwater level rises, indicative of groundwater recharge, correspond better to observed pulses of stream discharge from intensive rainfall observed upstream of the wellfield than rainfall recorded proximate to piezometers; and (3) stable isotope ratios of O and H indicate similar compositions of groundwater and ephemeral streamflow; both have undergone evaporative enrichment and are linked to intensive (90th percentile) daily rainfall. This characterisation of focused groundwater recharge from intensive rainfall in this tropical dryland highlights the potential resilience of groundwater resources to climate change amplifying precipitation extremes and informs strategies to augment replenishment of groundwater supplying the city of Dodoma.

However, there are gaps in literature regarding the interactions among factors, such as labor force and financial capital, in response to soil conservation, as well as the influence of such interactions on the relationships between environmental projects and agricultural development. By combining the Chinese Soil Loss Equation (CSLE) model and statistical analyses, this study investigated the spatio-temporal characteristics of soil erosion while also identifying the controlling factors that affect crop and livestock farming. The aim was to reveal how these factors interacted to influence agriculture in two case study areas between 2000 and 2017. The results showed that soil erosion substantially declined as a consequence of soil conservation, while the output from crop farming increased, indicating that there was a synergy between soil conservation and dryland farming in both the districts, over time; and factors facilitating crop farming, such as labor force, agricultural machinery, and irrigation, appeared to exert an adverse effect on livestock farming in both areas, implying a tradeoff between livestock and crop farming in the context of programs such as the Grain for Green Program (GGP) in the Loess Hills. Such a tradeoff is a result of the competition for cropland and labor that exists due to grazing prohibition and rural-urban migration.

However, our understanding of the response patterns of microbial diversity to climate change remains limited in distinct agriculture ecosystems across large spatial scales. Here, we explore the response patterns of soil bacterial community structure and function to dry-wet cycles in dryland (maize) and paddy (rice) agricultural ecosystems throughout eastern China. Location Eastern China. Time period November 2019 to May 2020. Major taxa studied Bacterial communities. Methods Incubation experiments with dry-wet cycles were carried out on the soil samples collected from 25 paired maize and rice fields across eastern China. Bacterial community structure was estimated via high-throughput sequencing techniques. We applied quantitative polymerase chain reaction to evaluate the effect of the dry-wet cycle on the change of functional genes. Phylogenetic signals were examined based on Blomberg's K to test the phylogenetic conservatism of maize and rice bacterial communities during dry-wet cycles. Results Dry-wet cycles significantly decreased bacterial alpha diversity in both maize and rice soils, and bacterial communities from warmer regions were more sensitive to dry-wet cycles. The bacterial responses to dry-wet cycles were phylogenetically conserved, with greater phylogenetic conservation in the former. The abundance of functional genes that were related to carbon decomposition, nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification and organophosphorus mineralization decreased during dry-wet cycles, and the resistances of such functional genes to disturbance were stronger in rice soils than in maize soils. In addition, the relative abundances of stable amplicon sequence variants during dry-wet cycles had a significant positive linear relationship with functional gene abundance in the maize and rice soils, indicating their essential roles in the stability of microbial function. Main conclusions We conclude that soil bacterial community structure and function in dryland agricultural ecosystems are less stable and exhibit greater phylogenetic conservation in response to dry-wet cycles when compared with paddy fields. In addition, our study reveals, for the first time, the response patterns of bacterial communities to dry-wet cycles in dryland and wetland agroecosystems.																			1466-822X	1466-8238				FEB	2022	31	2					362	377		10.1111/geb.13433	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.13433		NOV 2021											WOS:000723007800001

Spatial variability of soil properties, such as soil structure and penetration resistance (PR), can help identify the compacted layer. However, there are no quantitative methods to describe this layer. In this study,PRwas used to survey different soil types. A Mann-Kendall (M-K) test ofPRdata was used to identify the presence and position of the compacted layer in a dryland farming region of Northeast China. Our results demonstrated thatPRwas mainly affected by bulk density and soil water content. Compared with the topsoil,PRwas more significantly affected by water content in deeper soil layers. An M-K test of thePRcurve can provide a more reliable and objective assessment of the thickness of the plough layer and location of the compacted layer than field observation. Our data indicated that there was a compacted layer in the soil profile in the study areas and the spatial variability of the compacted layer was heterogeneous. The plough layer was shallow, and the compacted layer was thicker in areas with frequent use of agricultural machinery. Moreover, frequent use of agricultural machinery resulted in aPRof the plough and compacted layers that was greater than that in other areas. Information on identifying the position and thickness of the compacted layer and the factors influencing their spatial distribution can be used to create effective soil management options and improve conditions for the development of plant roots in dryland farming regions.

Louis			Modeling management of continuous dryland cotton with an intervening winter wheat cover crop in a semiarid climate	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS												Although winter cover crop residue can mitigate the stresses of dryland production in semi-arid regions, cover crops can also reduce soil moisture and cash crop yields. In some field studies of dryland cotton grown after terminated winter wheat in the U.S. Southern High Plains (SHP) and Texas Rolling Plains cotton yields were increased relative to continuous cotton, while others had no significant yield or soil water effect. These uncertain outcomes may be due to the trial's limited sampling of seasonal rainfall conditions. To estimate the probabilities of cover crop effects under more representative SHP climate conditions, 294 station-years of crop model simulations of terminated winter wheat followed by dryland cotton were conducted. These simulations were driven by weather data from 21 SHP weather stations during 2005-2019. Each station-year's simulations were repeated under 54 combinations of wheat planting, termination, and cotton planting dates, 2 soil series with different water capacities, and 10 initial soil moisture conditions. When simulations begin with fall soil moisture at field capacity optimal management options for both soils plant wheat early and cotton late, but have different wheat termination dates. Before cotton planting winter cover crop effects are dominated by reduced surface evaporation and increased transpiration, with greater transpiration effects producing decreased column soil moisture (CSM) at wheat termination. Some soil moisture recharge occurs between termination and cotton planting, but cover crops reduce CSM at cotton planting in both soils in similar to 75% of simulations. Reduced soil evaporation and soil moisture recovery continues after cotton planting, resulting in positive effects on seed cotton yield in 50% of the silty clay loam simulations and in 67% of the fine sandy loam simulations. Gradually reducing initial fall soil moisture in the silty clay loam reduces wheat biomass but increases the incidence of positive effects on seed cotton yields and CSM at cotton planting and harvest. By contrast, drier initial soil moisture in the fine sandy loam had relatively minor yield and CSM effects. In both soils terminated wheat residue led to increased CSM at cotton harvest in at least 70% of the simulations regardless of soil moisture at wheat planting.

The Qilian Mountains (QLMs) typify dryland mountain ranges in northern temperate belts and offer fundamental ecosystem services including forage production and water conservation. However, dominant controls on the interannual trend and variability of net primary productivity (NPP) in this region are unknown. Thus, we examined magnitude and direction of the NPP trend and quantified NPP sensitivity to temperature and precipitation under different biomes and altitudes using ground and remote sensing data. Our results showed that 12% of the QLMs had a reversed NPP trend from increasing to decreasing from 2000 to 2016, particularly in the western and southern parts, where NPP reductions were related to precipitation deficits. About 34% of the QLMs showed accelerated or persistent increasing NPP trends, mainly from the mid-altitude between 3,100 and 4,300 m. The growth rate of NPP was higher in deserts and grasslands than in forests and increased in deserts but decreased in forests and grasslands with increasing elevation. Precipitation showed a stronger effect on the interannual variability in NPP than temperature did. The temperature sensitivity of NPP was similar along elevation gradients in forest steppes but decreased with increasing elevation in alpine deserts. The precipitation sensitivity of NPP reached highest in shrubby meadows when compared with coniferous forests and alpine deserts. This research provides new insights into climate controls of the NPP over the QLMs and to present drought as a growing threat to shrubby meadows and alpine deserts.

J	Zhang, F; Wang, CH; Wang, ZH				Zhang, Fang; Wang, Chenghao; Wang, Zhi-Hua			Response of Natural Vegetation to Climate in Dryland Ecosystems: A Comparative Study between Xinjiang and Arizona	REMOTE SENSING												As one of the most sensitive areas to climate change, drylands cover similar to 40% of the Earth's terrestrial land surface and host more than 38% of the global population. Meanwhile, their response to climate change and variability carries large uncertainties as induced by background climate, topography, and land cover composition; but there is a lack of intercomparison of different dryland ecosystems. In this study, we compare the changing climate and corresponding responses of major natural vegetation cover types in Xinjiang and Arizona, two typical drylands with similar landscapes in Asia and North America. Long-term (2002-2019) quasi-8-day datasets of daily precipitation, daily mean temperature, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were constructed based on station observations and remote sensing products. We found that much of Xinjiang experienced warming and wetting trends (although not co-located) over the past 18 years. In contrast, Arizona was dominated by warming with insignificant wetting or drying trends. Significant greening trends were observed in most parts of both study areas, while the increasing rate of NDVI anomalies was relatively higher in Xinjiang, jointly contributed by its colder and drier conditions. Significant degradation of vegetation growth (especially for shrubland) was observed over 18.8% of Arizona due to warming. Our results suggest that responses of similar natural vegetation types under changing climate can be diversified, as controlled by temperature and moisture in areas with different aridity.

Wadis as dryland river parks: challenges and opportunities in designing with hydro-ecological dynamics	LANDSCAPE RESEARCH												Dryland rivers (wadis in Arabic) are characterised by high levels of flow unpredictability due to their severe dry-wet hydrological regimes. In the Arabian Peninsula, recent attention has focused on revitalising the socio-ecological values of wadis by rejuvenating them as linear public parks. In this paper, we review the key hydro-ecological characteristics of wadis and examine a range of design responses to address their dynamics in urban areas. Three case studies of recent and ongoing rehabilitation projects in Muscat, Oman, were spatially analysed and interviews with stakeholders involved in the projects were conducted. Design strategies and system-based approaches were suggested, including taking account of the hydro-ecological processes and relationships across multiple spatial and temporal scales, interdisciplinary collaborations, and testing the systems' performance through design experimentation. The findings can be applied to the rehabilitation of ephemeral rivers in dry and drying environments globally.

Recent findings indicate that extent of dryland in the Mediterranean region has been expanding in the past decades and will continue to expand in the coming decades due to the stronger warming effect than other regions. The warming trend with intensified human activities has generated a series of negative impacts on productivity, biodiversity, and stability of the dryland ecosystem in Mediterranean region. Increased population, overgrazing and, grazing abandonment intensified the land degradation and desertification. The coverage, richness, and abundance of biological soil crust have been reduced due to the decline of soil water availability and increased animals. Future studies are required to further our understanding of the process and mechanism of the dryland dynamics, including the identification of essential variables, discriminating human and climate-induced changes, and modeling future trajectories of dryland changes.

However, the scientific comparison of field-scale use of single vs. repeated application of HA has not been reported. A field study was conducted to quantify the effect of different numbers of annual HA applications on (i) oat crop performance indicators, and (ii) the changes in soil health metrics in a dryland farming ecosystem. We found that multiple years of annual HA application improved crop growth, and increased grain protein yield (up to 60%), grain yield (21%), water use efficiency (22%), partial factor productivity of nitrogen (21%) and economic benefit (34%) over that for the control (no HA) during both a wetter and a drier growing season. The greater input of crop residue associated with higher yields led to an increase of soil organic carbon and water storage at both 0-20 and 20-60 cm soil layers, and a reduction in soil electrical conductivity, pH and bulk density with increasing years of HA application. There was an overall improvement in soil micro-environmental conditions. These in turn promoted an increased activity of the soil enzymes urease (up to 89%), invertase and catalase and soil nutrient turnover and availability (e.g. up to 58% higher plant available nitrogen). Our results show for the first time that repeated annual HA application of at least 2 years would be a cost-effective strategy to combat land degradation and nurture sustainable crop production in dryland agriculture under widely varying weather scenarios expected with climate change.					liu, jinghui/IAP-8628-2023	Ma, Bin/0000-0003-3326-2317													0167-1987	1879-3444				APR	2022	218								105306	10.1016/j.still.2021.105306	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2021.105306		JAN 2022											WOS:000776080400002

The fate of these forests under climate warming is strongly affected by local environmental factors. The question remains of how internal factors contribute to climate change impacts on forest growth in these regions. Here, we investigated tree ring records for similar-aged stand-grown trees and their neighboring open-grown trees at elevation in a dryland montane forest (Picea crassifolia Kom.) in northwestern China. The growth rate of open-grown trees is much higher than their neighboring stand-grown trees across the entire elevation gradient, and the lower the altitude, the greater the difference. Open-grown trees at different elevations showed similar growth patterns, as tree growth at all sites was accelerated over time. In contrast, growth patterns of stand-grown trees were divergent at different altitudes, as growth at high elevations (3100-3300 m a.s.l.) was accelerated, whereas growth at low elevations (2700-2900 m a.s.l.) became stable after the year 1990. Analysis of growth-climate relationships indicated that warming promoted open-grown tree growth across the entire altitude gradient, and also stand-grown tree growth at high elevations, but negatively affected the growth of stand-grown trees at low elevations. Water scarcity can be exacerbated by competition within forests, inhibiting the warming-induced benefits on tree growth. Moving window correlation analysis suggested the negative effect of warming on tree growth at low elevations was diminished after the late 1990s, as the drought stress was alleviated. Our research shows the divergent growth responses to warming of stand-grown and open-grown trees along elevation. It reveals effects of internal factors in determining tree growth response to warming and holds the potential to aid forest management and ecosystem models in responding to climate change.

Improving dryland cropping system nitrogen balance with no-tillage and nitrogen fertilization	JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE												Studies on N balance due to N inputs and outputs and soil N retention to measure cropping system performance and environmental sustainability are limited due to the complexity of measurements of some parameters. We measured N balance based on N inputs and outputs and soil N retention under dryland agroecosystem affected by cropping system and N fertilization from 2006 to 2011 in the northern Great Plains, USA. Cropping systems were conventional tillage barley (Hordeum vulgaris L.)-fallow (CTB-F), no-tillage barley-fallow (NTB-F), no-tillage barley-pea (Pisum sativum L.) (NTB-P), and no-tillage continuous barley (NTCB). In these cropping systems, N was applied to barley at four rates (0, 40, 80, and 120 kg N ha(-1)), but not to pea and fallow. Total N input due to N fertilization, pea N fixation, soil N mineralization, atmospheric N deposition, nonsymbiotic N fixation, and crop seed N and total N output due to grain N removal, denitrification, volatilization, N leaching, gaseous N (NOx) emissions, surface runoff, and plant senescence were 28-37% greater with NTB-P and NTCB than CTB-F and NTB-F. Total N input and output also increased with increased N rate. Nitrogen accumulation rate at the 0-120 cm soil depth ranged from -32 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) for CTB-F to 40 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) for NTB-P and from -22 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) for N rates of 0 kg N ha(-1) to 45 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) for 120 kg N ha(-1). Nitrogen balance ranged from 1 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) for NTB-P to 74 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) for CTB-F. Because of increased grain N removal but reduced N loss to the environment and N fertilizer requirement as well as efficient N cycling, NTB-P with 40 kg N ha(-1) may enhance agronomic performance and environmental sustainability while reducing N inputs compared to other management practices.

Pakistan is a typical dryland region with significant land degradation and dramatic changes in ES in recent decades, which has not been sufficiently investigated. This study explored the spatiotemporal variations in ecosystem service values (ESV) over Pakistan (2001-2018) by combining land use/cover data, economic modeling, and hotspot analysis. From the achieved results, the total ESV indicated an improvement in ES before 2012 and then showed a declining trend. The largest contribution was attributed to the increase in forest/shrubland by 16.17% (2001-2006) and 10.36% (2006-2012). However, the ESV decreased to 7.76% from 2012 to 2018, which was mainly attributed to the decrease in cropland and grassland. Heterogeneous changes were observed in ESV. The hotspot of ESV change (approximately an area of 32,578 km(2)) was mainly located in the southern and southeastern parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), the northeastern part of Balochistan and the central and western parts of Sindh Province. The cold spot (approximately an area of 24,491 km(2)) showed a distribution in the northern part of KPK and Gilgit Baltistan, northeastern Punjab, coastal regions, and southeastern Sindh Province. We also found that although the total ESV and gross domestic product (GDP) indicated growth, the proportion of ESV from the total ESV and GDP (%ESV) exhibited a negative trend. The Provinces of Punjab and Balochistan retained the highest value of %ESV, while Azad Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan were much lower. These results reflected the spatial imbalance of ecosystem protection and economic development in Pakistan. We recommend that necessary actions for conserving ES are important to strengthen ecological conservation in Pakistan. Additionally, further interdisciplinary research is needed to fully explore synergies in conserving ES and economical conservation.

J	Zhao, HB; Liu, JF; Chen, XW; Wang, ZH				Zhao, Hubing; Liu, Jifei; Chen, Xiuwen; Wang, Zhaohui			Straw mulch as an alternative to plastic film mulch: Positive evidence from dryland wheat production on the Loess Plateau	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A large body of research has emphasized how plastic mulching can benefit crop yields in dryland areas. However, this practice's pollution of the soil, air and environment has only recently attracted attention. We conducted a five-year field experiment with winter wheat as a test crop to evaluate whether plastic mulching can be replaced with straw mulching in dryland areas of the Loess Plateau in China. The obtained results showed that straw mulching (SM) resulted in similar grain yields that were comparable with plastic mulching. More specifically, ridge-furrow plastic mulching plus furrow seeding (RM + FS), whole field plastic mulching (PM) and SM treatments resulted in average yields of 5950,6447 and 6246 kg ha(-1), respectively. No soil water storage difference was observed at harvest, but SM retained more water during summer fallow and then stored more water prior to seeding, 26 mm and 27 mm higher that of PM, and 44 mm and 46 mm higher that of RM + FS, respectively. None of the three treatments caused soil nitrate-N leaching. Furthermore, because straw is a potential source of slow-releasing N, the SM 0-200 cm soil profile contained significantly more nitrate-N than the corresponding RM FS and PM soil profiles. The SM treatment decreased greenhouse gas emissions intensity (GHGI) by 47% and 40% and increased economic return by 13% and 27% when compared to the PM and RM + FS treatments, respectively. Therefore, an optimized SM system is a viable alternative for increasing crop yields in dryland wheat production that avoids the negative impacts of the increasingly popular plastic mulching approach.

The field experiment was conducted at Loess Plateau in Shanxi, China from 2012 to 2015, to study the effect of subsoiling and conventional tillage and different sowing dates on the soil water storage, Nitrogen (N) accumulation, and remobilization and yield of winter wheat. The results showed that subsoiling significantly improved the soil water storage (0-300 cm soil depth) and increased the contribution of N translocation to grain N and grain yield (17-36%). Delaying sowing time had reduced the soil water storage at sowing and winter accumulated growing degree days by about 180 degrees C. The contribution of N translocation to grain yield was maximum in glume + spike followed by in leaves and minimum by stem + sheath. Moreover, there was a positive relationship between the N accumulation and translocation and the soil moisture in the 20-300 cm range. Subsoiling during the fallow period and the medium sowing date was beneficial for improving the soil water storage and increased the N translocation to grain, thereby increasing the yield of wheat, especially in a dry year.

This study aims to determine accumulation rates of pedogenic carbonates in intensively irrigated soils, and to define key linkages between flood irrigation, salt loading and soil-atmosphere CO2 exchange in cultivated drylands of the southwestern United States. We used a combination of elemental chemistry (CaO, soil organic and inorganic carbon contents), mineralogy, and U-series (U-238-U-234-Th-230) disequilibrium dating technique to investigate calcium sources, ages and formation rates of pedogenic carbonates. Study sites include an irrigated alfalfa field near El Paso in western Texas and a non-irrigated natural dryland site on the USDA Jornada Experimental Range of southern New Mexico. Our results showed that large amounts of dissolved calcium and inorganic carbon along with other soluble elements were loaded onto agricultural fields through irrigation waters in El Paso, TX while dust and rainfall were important for salt loading in natural soils of the Jornada. U-series activity ratios, (U-234/U-238) and (Th-230/U-238), in bulk soils suggested eolian deposits added U and modified U isotopes in shallow soils at both the irrigated and natural sites. Mobility of U-234 within the soil profile is related to leaching of U (and by inference other soluble ions) and carbonate accumulation at depth. The U-series dating technique in pedogenic carbonates revealed the presence of much younger carbonates at the irrigated site compared to the natural site. Pedogenic carbonate formation rates in the irrigated soils were also much higher than those in the non-irrigated soils, likely a result of influxes from dissolved Ca and inorganic carbon in water used for irrigation. This study demonstrates the potential for agricultural expansion and land use change in drylands to increase rate of pedogenic carbonate accumulation. Such changes may have important implications to global carbon cycling since drylands are forecast to become the most expansive terrestrial biome by mid-century and dryland agriculture is expanding quickly.																			0009-2541	1872-6836				NOV 20	2019	527				SI					10.1016/j.chemgeo.2017.10.014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2017.10.014													WOS:000501718200011

Understanding how dryland ecosystems respond to environmental changes, both structurally and functionally, is of great significance for sustainable dryland management. In this article, we review the current remote sensing-based knowledge on African dryland ecosystem dynamics and the main drivers of changes. Global CO2 enrichment, changes in rainfall regimes, and a decline in fire activity have collectively driven vegetation greening, woody plant increase and carbon dynamics in African drylands over recent decades, challenging the long-held desertification narrative. Here we also highlight the importance of rainfall-vegetation-fire feedbacks in enhancing dryland ecosystem resilience and predicting future ecosystem responses.

Based on field experiments from 2015 to 2021 in Gansu Province, this study combined weather data and yearbook yield data from 1984 to 2021 to optimize parameters related to grain growth of spring wheat in dryland based on the next-generation APSIM using two algorithms: the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm and the DREAM-zs algorithm. The results were as follows: the optimization results of both algorithms were the same, but the DREAM-zs algorithm converged faster; the optimized parameters for the grain growth stage of Dingxi35 spring wheat were: a grain number per gram stem of 25 grains, an initial grain proportion of 0.05, and a maximum grain size of 0.049 g; after optimization, the root mean square error (RMSE) of observed and simulated yield values decreased from 186.84 kg/hm(2) to 115.71 kg/hm(2), and the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) decreased from 10.33% to 6.40%. The optimized results were consistent with the growth and development process of wheat and had high applicability.

J	Hooke, JM				Hooke, J. M.			Extreme sediment fluxes in a dryland flash flood	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												A flash flood on 28th September, 2012, rose to a peak discharge of 2357 m(3) s(-1) from zero within one hour in the ephemeral Nogalte channel in SE Spain. Channel morphology and sediment sizes were measured at existing monitored sites before and after the flood and peak flow hydraulics calculated from surveyed floodmarks and cross-sections. Maximum peak sediment fluxes were calculated as similar to 600 kg s(-1) m(-1), exceeding maximum published, measured dryland channel values by 10 times and common perennial stream fluxes by 100 times. These high fluxes fit the established simple bedload flux -shear stress relations for dryland channels very well, but now extended over a much wider data range. The high sediment fluxes are corroborated by deposits at >1 m height in a channel-side tank, with 90 mm diameter sediment carried in suspension, by transport of large blocks and by massive net aggradation as extensive, structureless channel bars. Very high sediment supply and rapid hydrograph rise and recession produced the conditions for these exceptional sediment dynamics. The results demonstrate the extreme sediment loads that may occur in dryland flash floods and have major implications for catchment and channel management.

The results indicated sharp changes in the temperature (increase) and rainfall (decrease) of the study area between 2010 and 2015. Based on the plot analysis of cultivars phenology and grain yield variations, cultivar Azar2 showed more instability compared to Sardari during 2005-2015. The results of the regression analysis showed extended length of growing period (LGP) and the length of vegetative phase (LVP) for Sardari and Azar2 cultivars as well as extended length of grain filling period (LGFP) and increased grain yield for Azar2 during 2005-2015. For Azar2, shortened LGP, LVP, and decreased grain yield were observed during 2010-2015. Overall, temperature (maximum and minimum) had more determining effects on Sardari grain yield compared with rainfall. The results also indicated that the phenology and yield of both cultivars were more dependent on the weather conditions during April and May. This study concluded that variations in LGFP led to more significant changes in grain yield of both cultivars (i.e., Sardari and Azar2). This study further concluded that phenology and grain yield of Azar2 were more affected by weather variability than Sardari.

Core Rhizosphere Microbiomes of Dryland Wheat Are Influenced by Location and Land Use History	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The Inland Pacific Northwest is one of the most productive dryland wheat production areas in the United States. We explored the bacterial and fungal communities associated with wheat in a controlled greenhouse experiment using soils from multiple locations to identify core taxa consistently associated with wheat roots and how land use history influences wheat-associated communities. Further, we examined microbial co-occurrence networks from wheat rhizospheres to identify candidate hub taxa. Location of origin and land use history (long-term no-till versus noncropped Conservation Reserve Program [CRP]) of soils were the strongest drivers of bacterial and fungal communities. Wheat rhizospheres were especially enriched in many bacterial families, while only a few fungal taxa were enriched in the rhizosphere. There was a core set of bacteria and fungi that was found in >95% of rhizosphere or bulk soil samples, including members of Bradyrhizobium, Sphingomonadaceae, Massilia, Variovorax, Oxalobacteraceae, and Caulobacteraceae. Core fungal taxa in the rhizosphere included Nectriaceae, Ulocladium, Alternaria, Mortierella, and Microdochium. Overall, there were fewer core fungal taxa, and the rhizosphere effect was not as pronounced as with bacteria. Cross-domain co-occurrence networks were used to identify hub taxa in the wheat rhizosphere, which included bacterial and fungal taxa (e.g., Sphingomonas, Massilia, Knufia, and Microdochium). Our results suggest that there is a relatively small group of core rhizosphere bacteria that were highly abundant on wheat roots regardless of soil origin and land use history. These core communities may play important roles in nutrient uptake, suppressing fungal pathogens, and other plant health functions. IMPORTANCE Plant-associated microbiomes are critical for plant health and other important agroecosystem processes. We assessed the bacterial and fungal microbiomes of wheat grown in soils from across a dryland wheat cropping systems in eastern Washington to identify the core microbiome on wheat roots that is consistent across soils from different locations and land use histories. Moreover, cross-domain co-occurrence network analysis identified core and hub taxa that may play important roles in microbial community assembly. Candidate core and hub taxa provide a starting point for targeting microbiome components likely to be critical to plant health and for constructing synthetic microbial communities for further experimentation. This work is one of the first examples of identifying a core microbiome on a major field crop grown across hundreds of square kilometers over a wide range of biogeographical zones.																			0099-2240	1098-5336				MAR	2020	86	5							e02135-19	10.1128/AEM.02135-19	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02135-19								31862727					WOS:000519018300005

This practice affects the physical and chemical processes of soil, including carbon and nitrogen cycling. However, research into microbe-mediated carbon and nitrogen cycling in soil with plastic mulching is still limited. In this study, the structures and functions of the soil bacterial community in non-mulched spring maize, plastic-mulched spring maize, and bareland fallow in a dryland field on the Loess Plateau in China were analyzed to explore the responses of microbe-mediated carbon and nitrogen cycling to plastic mulching. Results showed that the richness of soil bacteria was the highest in bareland fallow. Plastic mulching increased the diversity and richness of soil bacteria to a certain extent (p > 0.05), and significantly increased the content of microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) (p < 0.05). Plastic mulching enhanced the total abundances of carbon and nitrogen cycling-related microbes, exhibiting a significant increase in the abundances of Cellvibrio, Bacillus, Methylobacterium and Nitrospira (p < 0.05). Predicted functional analysis revealed 299 metabolic pathways related to carbon and nitrogen cycling, including methane metabolism, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, and nitrogen metabolism. The number of gene families assigned to carbon and nitrogen cycling-related metabolic pathways was higher in plastic mulched than that in non-mulched spring maize. This study demonstrated that plastic mulching enhances the capacity of carbon and nitrogen cycling, revealing its potential in mediating greenhouse gas emissions in the dryland spring maize fields on the Loess Plateau.						wang, sen/0000-0003-3155-1836; Liu, Wanyu/0000-0001-8319-5496														2077-0472				NOV	2021	11	11							1040	10.3390/agriculture11111040	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11111040													WOS:000724895500001

Due to their high tolerance to harsh environments, biocrusts are present in a wide range of habitats, but are especially representative ground covers in regions with restricted vegetation growth, such as drylands (hyperarid, arid, semiarid, and dry subhumid regions) where water is a limiting factor, or high latitude or altitude regions where cold is a limiting factor. Since biocrusts fulfill a large range of ecological roles particularly in modifying soil properties and regulating functions, their rehabilitation and management is believed to be a promising measure for combating land degradation. We organized this article collection to further highlight the importance of biocrusts and their fundamental roles in reshaping soil properties and multifunctionality in drylands and other ecosystems, and to elucidate the ways in which global change factors are influencing biocrust-soil systems. The special issue brings together 27 research articles pertinent to soil-biocrust interactions or biocrust response to global change and disturbance from 12 countries worldwide (10 papers from China, 6 papers from the USA, 2 papers from Spain, 2 papers from Australia, in addition to studies from Antarctica, Argentina, Brazil, Iceland, Iran, Mexico, Norway, South Africa, and Sweden). The discussed topics include biocrust roles in regulating soil hydrology (6 papers), reducing soil erosion (4 papers), affecting soil carbon fixation and respiration (2 papers), and influencing soil microbial biodiversity (5 papers). The responses of biocrusts themselves and their functions to trampling disturbance (2 papers), land use shifts (2 papers), and climate change (5 papers) are also emphasized. On the whole, we highlight the capability of biocrusts in reshaping most properties of surface soil, acting as engineers and architects of surface soil properties, functions, and processes in dryland or other harsh environments, and we recognize the necessity of their protection and consideration as valuable nature-based measures to combat soil and land degradation.

The objective of this study was to investigate the potential use of infrared thermal imaging to determine crop canopy temperature (Tc) and evaluate wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes under drought conditions. Thermal images were acquired at anthesis and grain-filling stages from 17 genotypes grown under dryland conditions in 2015 and 2016 winter wheat growing season at Bushland, TX. A handheld thermal camera was used to acquire thermal images and the images were processed using customized image processing software. The customized software filters out the background soil from the thermal images and calculates the mean Tc. A significant difference (p < .05) in Tc among genotypes was found during grain filling in 2015 and at anthesis in 2016. Genotypes TAM 111, TAM 114, PlainsGold Byrd, and Jagalene had cooler canopies, and Billings, TAM 304, and TAM 105 had warmer canopies in both years. There was a significant negative correlation between grain yield and Tc measured at anthesis (r =-.48, p < .05) and grain-filling (r = -.33, p < .05). Infrared thermal imaging showed a promising method to obtain Tc, which can be used to evaluate genotypes for drought tolerance.

J	Wang, YY				Wang, Yiyong			WATER USE EFFICIENCY IN DRYLAND FARMING OF SOYBEANS IN THE SANJIANG PLAIN, CHIN	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												Water use efficiency, carbon fluxes, and turbulent fluxes at a dryland soybean site were studied at the Sanjiang Ecological Station in China. The carbon and turbulent energy fluxes were measured by an open path eddy-covariance technique in 2005, along with complementary measurements of soil moisture, leaf area index and biomass, and meteorological parameters. The cropland was reclaimed from wetlands in 1993 and is now used for dry land agriculture. Results showed that the maximum of carbon absorbance (-0.96mg.CO2.m(-2).s(-1)) appeared at the seed filling stage. The diurnal variations of latent heat flux (LE) and sensible heat flux (H) had the same diurnal variation characteristics and showed the shape of an inverted "V" during the soybean growing season, with LE close to zero and H negative at nighttime; both reached a maximum at midday following the diurnal variation of solar radiation. The ratio of LE/Rn was high during the tillage period because of strong soil evaporation, and then decreased quickly. The ratio of LE/Rn increased with the development of the soybean plants and reached a peak value of 0.68 at the seed filling stage. In contrast, the trend of H/Rn was inversely related with LEtRn, and the ratio of Delta Qs/Rn increased in the spring time and decreased in the autumn with the decline in air temperature. Evapotranspiration was the main consumption component of solar radiation from anthesis to maturity stages. Water use efficiency (WUE) of soybean plants throughout the growing season showed a pattern of reverse "U" type, WUE increased with sunrise and decreased with sunset. with little change from 6:00-17:00 hr. Thus. there was no clear peak value. The WUE increased with the soybean development after seedling emergence. The maximum values of WUE were 0.0004, 0,0169, 0.0266, 0.0241 and 0,0085 mg.mg(-1) at seeding, branching, anthesis, pod-setting, seed filling- maturity stages respectively. The WUE of soybean was larger than the WUE of Carex lasiocarpa wetland in June, July and Aupst. There was a positive conclation between LAI and WUE; the Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.5076(n=59). However there was only a significant correlation between above ground biomass and WUE during the period of increasing LAI. At the crop level, WUE of biomass and grain reached 17.14 kg,hm(-2).mm(-1) and 7.12 kg.hm(-2).mm(-1) respectively; it was similar to the common spring soybean water use efficiency 6.2 kg.hm(-2).mm(-1), and slightly higher than the results in Hailun,																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2020	29	9					7219	7227																WOS:000629178300005

Although the net primary production (NPP) is the principal source of C inputs to soil, plant-microbe interactions can help increase NPP and stimulate plant C inputs to the soil through a variety of mechanisms. Additionally, the soil microbial community plays a crucial role in the loss (CO2 respiration) and stabilisation of SOC. With improved understanding of soil microbiomes and plant-microbe interactions, there are new emerging strategies in which microorganisms may be harnessed either directly or indirectly to increase the amount of C added and stabilised in dryland soils.

IMPACT OF CONSERVATION TILLAGE ON ORGANIC MATTER DYNAMICS IN LOESS DRYLAND SOIL, PUNJAB, PAKISTAN	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES-JAPS												Conservation tillage and carbon sequestration are critical issues in rain-fed farming areas of Pakistan. Conservation tillage is not extensively used in developing countries on dryland soil where marginal farming is practiced. Therefore, primary purpose of this experiment was to determine the influence of conservation tillage practices on soil organic carbon (SOC), particulate organic matter (POC), mineral associated organic carbon (MOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and dehydrogenase activity (Dha) in loess dry land Pothwar, Punjab, Pakistan. The tillage practices included zero tillage (ZT), minimum tillage (MT), reduced tillage (RT) and conventional tillage (CT) with mouldboardplough as a control in main plot and fallow-wheat ( Triticumaestivum L.) and mungbean (Vigna radiate L.) crop rotation in sub plot as a split plot layout. The results indicated that ZT showed higher SOC (7.90 g kg(-1)), POC (2.35 g kg(-1)), MOC (5.1 g kg(-1)), MBC (359.37 mu gg(-1)) and Dha (45.12 TPF mu gg(-1) dry weight) than CT. Among crop rotation, overall mungbean-wheat showed higher values as compared to fallow-wheat crop. The study indicated that conservation tillage practices with legume crop rotation have potential for improving soil organic carbon storage and hence carbon sequestration in soil.																			1018-7081	2309-8694				OCT	2022	32	5					1274	1286		10.36899/JAPS.2022.5.0534	http://dx.doi.org/10.36899/JAPS.2022.5.0534													WOS:000911005800002

Plant nutritional adaptations under differing resource supply for a dryland grass <i>Leymus chinensis</i>	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The growth-rate hypothesis (GRH) says that fast-growing organisms have relatively high P content and lower N:P ratios because they need more P-rich ribosomal RNA (rRNA) to fuel increased protein-synthesis. However, there is a lack of understanding for how environmental factors influence plant N:P stoichiometry, and it is unknown if the GRH applies to vascular plants in drylands. Here, we test the GRH in dryland plants by measuring biomass N:P ratios in Leymus chinensis, a perennial dryland grass commonly found in Inner Mongolia grasslands. We determined relative growth rates (RGR) and adaptation to changes in water, N, and P availability in substrate. Generally, adding water, N, and P to substrate stimulated growth. Increased water supply decreased plant N concentrations, but increased plant P concentrations. As expected by GRH, N:P ratios in plant biomass decreased as water supply and RGR increased. Biomass N:P ratios increased as N substrate addition and RGR increased, but decreased as P substrate addition and RGR increased. We conclude that plant N:P stoichiometry reflects substrate nutrient supply. Our results suggest that the GRH also applies to terrestrial dryland photoautotrophs, but is dependent upon resources.

AGRONOMY-BASEL												The current study was designed to investigate the best sowing method that encourages dry matter accumulation to increase dryland wheat yield, grain quality, and protein content. Three different seeding methods were applied: (I) wide-space sowing (WSS), (II) furrow sowing, and (III) drill sowing. Two nitrogen levels, namely low nitrogen (N1) and high nitrogen (N2), were also applied, and the pure nitrogen was 150 kg ha(-1) and 210 kg ha(-1), respectively. Wide-space sowing significantly increased the ears and yield production, the maximum, and average grain-filling rate while furrow sowing delayed the disappearance of the population after anthesis, increased the duration of grain filling, and then significantly increased the number of spikes and the 1000-grain weight increased, respectively. Drill sowing compared to wide-space sowing significantly increased the content of nitrogen in the grain of the nitrogen harvest index, and it increased the content of protein and the yield of protein, respectively. In addition, the grain yield and protein yield of wide-precision sowing were significantly higher than that of trench sowing. Our findings suggest that wide-space sowing was beneficial for increasing water consumption during the growth period, increasing the tiller dynamics, improving the plant dry matter quality, and increasing the grain protein.

Various digital soil mapping approaches based on either single-period remote sensing or spectral indices in other ecosystems usually produce inaccurate, poorly constrained estimates of dryland SOM. Here, a framework for spatially-detailed SOM mapping was proposed based on cross-wavelet transform (XWT) that exploits ecologically meaningful features from intra-annual fractional vegetation and soil-related endmember records. In this framework, paired green vegetation (GV) and soil-related endmembers (i.e., dark surface (DA), saline land (SA), sand land (SL)) sequences were adopted to extract 30 XWT features in temporally and spatially continuous domains of cross-wavelet spectrum. We then selected representative features as exploratory covariates for SOM mapping, integrated with four state-of-the-art machine learning approaches, i.e., ridge regression (RR), least squares-support vector machines (LS-SVM), random forests (RF), and gradient boosted regression trees (GBRT). The results reported that SOM maps from 13 coupled filtered XWT features and four machine learning approaches were consistent with soil-landscape knowledge, as evidenced by a spatially-detailed gradient from oasis to barren. This framework also presented more accurate and reliable results than arithmetically averaged features of intra-annual endmembers and existing datasets. Among the four approaches, both RF and GBRT were more appropriate in the XWT-based framework, showing superior accuracy, robustness, and lower uncertainty. The XWT synthetically characterized soil fertility from the consecutive structure of intra-annual vegetation and soil-related endmember sequences. Therefore, the proposed framework improved the understanding of SOM and land degradation neutrality, potentially leading to more sustainable management of dryland systems.

Its geographic distribution at both sides of the Pacific Ocean is associated with its plastic response to El Nin similar to o event, an extreme climate event that changes precipitation regimes. In this review, we summarized the current knowledge of this versatile species based on scientific literature. Our analysis conducted identify three main research topics: geographical distribution, ecophysiology and population plasticity, and ecosystem services provision to guide the review in a methodological and unbiased way. In the geographical distribution section, we describe the origin, history, and native distribution of algarrobo, as well as the current distribution and the degree of invasiveness in some countries. In the ecophysiology and population plasticity section, we focus on the mechanisms used by algarrobo to avoid water stress during drought and maximize plant growth during El Nin similar to o. We discuss how this is reflected in the most important leaf functional traits, such as leaf mass per area (LMA) or gas exchange-related traits. We analyse the importance of phenotypic plasticity and intraspecific variability as adaptive ways to resist extreme rainfall and prolonged droughts on P. pallida growth during the last 50 years. Finally, we summarized the main ecosystem services and ecological benefits provided by P. pallida as well as its potential industrial uses. With this review, we wish to consolidate the current scientific knowledge of this species, to point out gaps of knowledge and suggest future research directions. As the world becomes a warmer place, P. pallida can be a key species to understand plant resilience to extreme events in dryland ecosystems.

Vertical assessment of soil quality in permanent manurial experiment of dryland ecosystem, Tamil Nadu, India	CURRENT SCIENCE												A study was conducted to assess the impact of different nutrient management practices on soil quality in a permanent manurial experiment cotton field established in 1982 at the Agriculture Research Station of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, which falls under the dryland ecosystem of Kovilpatti in Tamil Nadu, India. The experiment was carried out in a randomized block design with nine different treatments. The effect of these treatments in different depths (0-15, 15-30 and 30- 45 cm) was compared, and the soil quality index was developed with a total of 27 parameters, including physical, chemical and biological parameters. Principal component analysis was carried out and the principal components with eigenvalue >1 were selected to determine the indicators to be retained in the minimum data set. The highly weighted variables, viz. field capacity, available water content, cation exchange capacity, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, etc. with a variance of 93.57% were retained for MDS. Linear scoring functions were used to transform them into unitless scores ranging from 0 to 1. Three different methods of soil quality were analysed, viz. weighed additive soil quality index (SQIw), additive soil quality index (SQIa) and Nemoro soil quality index (SQIn). In all three methods, the treatment receiving farmyard manure at 12.5 t ha-1 showed superiority in maintaining soil quality.

Field experiments (2013-2017) were conducted to determine the combined effects of straw mulching (0 and 8,000 kg ha-1) and tillage methods (no-tillage, rotary tillage, and plow tillage) on soil water, N, root distribution, plant N nutrition, tiller capability, and grain yield of dryland wheat. Straw mulching with no-tillage showed higher soil moisture, mineral N, and Olsen-P content than no-mulch with rotary tillage or plow tillage. These changes increased the total root length and surface area in the 0-20 cm soil layer but not in the 20-40 cm soil layer. Topsoil foraging strategies of root increased total N uptake, wheat return N from straw, and N balance while reducing N surplus, indicating that maize straw harvesting by mulching with no-tillage leads to a more efficient N recycling in the winter wheat-summer maize rotation system. Straw mulching with no-tillage showed greater aboveground plant dry mass and shoot N%, leading to increased plant N nutrition, tillering capability, and grain yield. Our results indicated that maize straw mulch with no-tillage increased fertile spike and grain yield by increasing soil water and N availability and maximizing root-soil interactions among the different combinations studied. Maize straw mulching with no-tillage could hence be recommended to dryland farming communities to transition from rotary tillage to a no-tillage conservation system and to increase soil and crop productivity in the maize-wheat rotation system.

Encoding diel hysteresis and the Birch effect in dryland soil respiration models through knowledge-guided deep learning	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Soil respiration in dryland ecosystems is challenging to model due to its complex interactions with environmental drivers. Knowledge-guided deep learning provides a much more effective means of accurately representing these complex interactions than traditional Q10-based models. Mutual information analysis revealed that future soil temperature shares more information with soil respiration than past soil temperature, consistent with their clockwise diel hysteresis. We explicitly encoded diel hysteresis, soil drying, and soil rewetting effects on soil respiration dynamics in a newly designed Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model. The model takes both past and future environmental drivers as inputs to predict soil respiration. The new LSTM model substantially outperformed three Q10-based models and the Community Land Model when reproducing the observed soil respiration dynamics in a semi-arid ecosystem. The new LSTM model clearly demonstrated its superiority for temporally extrapolating soil respiration dynamics, such that the resulting correlation with observational data is up to 0.7 while the correlations of the Q10-based models and the Community Land Model (CLM) are less than 0.4. Our results underscore the high potential for knowledge-guided deep learning to replace Q10-based soil respiration modules in Earth system models.

Thus, positive relationships between vegetative growth condition (VGC) and GS are expected in drylands. Since mining-induced dewatering tends to deplete GS surrounding mine sites, VGC should become less favorable due to a shortage of accessible water. However, quantitative analysis repealed the opposite. We found that global annual mineral production in drylands increased by 24%, while GS decreased by 22% but the VGC improved by 37% (2002-2010). And negative relationships between VGC and GS were detected in 84.7% of global dryland mine sites. We concluded that irrigation supported by mining-induced dewatering promoted the vegetation growth surrounding mine sites. However, since the GS is limited, irrigation-supported vegetation growth is unsustainable. This study elucidates the reason behind these abnormal negative relationships and highlights the potential risk of vegetation degradation induced by unsustainable groundwater depletion in global dryland mine sites.

J	Sun, CL; Feng, XM; Fu, BJ; Ma, SJ				Sun, Chuanlian; Feng, Xiaoming; Fu, Bojie; Ma, Shijun			Desertification vulnerability under accelerated dryland expansion	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Given accelerated dryland expansion, studies on aridity-driven desertification are of great importance for advancing our understanding of land degradation mechanisms and developing possible mitigation measures. However, the mechanism by which increased aridity drives ecosystems toward desertification and the impacts of aridity on desertification vulnerability both in space and over time remain unclear. Here, we collected eight key ecosystem structure/functioning data (including soil, vegetation, and animal) for threshold identification using piecewise linear models, and then linked them to biome shifts to explore the process of aridity-driven desertification. The results show that ecosystems along aridity index (AI, 1 - precipitation/potential evapotranspiration) gradients experience three vulnerable stages featuring different threshold and biome responses: a low vulnerability stage (AI: 0.5-0.65; mainly featuring a soil fertility loss and a forest decline), a moderate vulnerability stage (AI: 0.65-0.75; mainly featuring accelerated non-forest vegetation degradation) and a high vulnerability stage (AI: 0.75-1; mainly featuring rapid overall land degradation). According to further simulations, areas with low to high vulnerability account for 31% of the global terrestrial area, which is projected to increase by 18.8% (21.2%) by the end of the 21st century under the greenhouse gas emission scenario SSP2-4.5 (SSP3-7.0). Given increased vulnerability and population growth, Africa and East Asia are exposed to great desertification risk and ensuing contradiction between humans and land. These findings can provide a theoretical and practical reference for ecosystem management and policy development, which are critical for dryland ecological security and human welfare in areas threatened by desertification.																			1085-3278	1099-145X				APR 30	2023	34	7					1991	2004		10.1002/ldr.4584	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4584		JAN 2023											WOS:000905667800001

Despite their relatively sparse vegetation, dryland ecosystems are structurally and functionally diverse, and emerging evidence suggests that these ecosystems play a dominant role in the trend and variability of the terrestrial carbon sink. More, drylands are highly sensitive to climate and are likely to have large, non-linear responses to hydroclimatic change. Monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of dryland ecosystem structure (e.g., leaf area index) and function (e.g., primary production and evapotranspiration) is therefore a high research priority. Yet, dryland remote sensing is defined by unique challenges not typically encountered in mesic or humid regions. Major challenges include low vegetation signal-to-noise ratios, high soil background reflectance, presence of photosynthetic soils (i.e., biological soil crusts), high spatial heterogeneity from plot to regional scales, and irregular growing seasons due to unpredictable seasonal rainfall and frequent periods of drought. Additionally, there is a relative paucity of continuous, long-term measurements in drylands, which impedes robust calibration and evaluation of remotely-sensed dryland data products. Due to these issues, remote sensing techniques developed in other ecosystems or for global application often result in inaccurate, poorly constrained estimates of dryland ecosystem structural and functional dynamics. Here, we review past achievements and current progress in remote sensing of dryland ecosystems, including a detailed discussion of the major challenges associated with remote sensing of key dryland structural and functional dynamics. We then identify strategies aimed at leveraging new and emerging opportunities in remote sensing to overcome previous challenges and more accurately contextualize drylands within the broader Earth system. Specifically, we recommend: 1) Exploring novel combinations of sensors and techniques (e.g., solar-induced fluorescence, thermal, microwave, hyperspectral, and LiDAR) across a range of spatiotemporal scales to gain new insights into dryland structural and functional dynamics; 2) utilizing near-continuous observations from new-and-improved geostationary satellites to capture the rapid responses of dryland ecosystems to diurnal variation in water stress; 3) expanding ground observational networks to better represent the heterogeneity of dryland systems and enable robust calibration and evaluation; 4) developing algorithms that are specifically tuned to dryland ecosystems by utilizing expanded ground observational network data; and 5) coupling remote sensing observations with process-based models using data assimilation to improve mechanistic understanding of dryland ecosystem dynamics and to better constrain ecological forecasts and long-term projections.

Monthly and seasonal streamflow forecasting of large dryland catchments in Brazil	JOURNAL OF ARID LAND												Streamflow forecasting in drylands is challenging. Data are scarce, catchments are highly human-modified and streamflow exhibits strong nonlinear responses to rainfall. The goal of this study was to evaluate the monthly and seasonal streamflow forecasting in two large catchments in the Jaguaribe River Basin in the Brazilian semi-arid area. We adopted four different lead times: one month ahead for monthly scale and two, three and four months ahead for seasonal scale. The gaps of the historic streamflow series were filled up by using rainfall-runoff modelling. Then, time series model techniques were applied, i.e., the locally constant, the locally averaged, the k-nearest-neighbours algorithm (k-NN) and the autoregressive (AR) model. The criterion of reliability of the validation results is that the forecast is more skillful than streamflow climatology. Our approach outperformed the streamflow climatology for all monthly streamflows. On average, the former was 25% better than the latter. The seasonal streamflow forecasting (SSF) was also reliable (on average, 20% better than the climatology), failing slightly only for the high flow season of one catchment (6% worse than the climatology). Considering an uncertainty envelope (probabilistic forecasting), which was considerably narrower than the data standard deviation, the streamflow forecasting performance increased by about 50% at both scales. The forecast errors were mainly driven by the streamflow intra-seasonality at monthly scale, while they were by the forecast lead time at seasonal scale. The best-fit and worst-fit time series model were the k-NN approach and the AR model, respectively. The rainfall-runoff modelling outputs played an important role in improving streamflow forecasting for one streamgauge that showed 35% of data gaps. The developed data-driven approach is mathematical and computationally very simple, demands few resources to accomplish its operational implementation and is applicable to other dryland watersheds. Our findings may be part of drought forecasting systems and potentially help allocating water months in advance. Moreover, the developed strategy can serve as a baseline for more complex streamflow forecast systems.

The dryland areas of China (DAC) are hot spots of aeolian dust emissions. To date, many efforts have been paid to researching dust emissions processes and effects, but research studies on ecosystems' function in preventing dust emissions are still very limited. In this study, we investigated the function of DAC ecosystems in preventing dust emissions, and the corresponding driving factors through integrated wind erosion modelling system (IWEMS) modelling. The main results indicate that: (1) from 2001 to 2020, the ecosystems of DAC prevented the emission of dust similar to 40,554 Tg, approximately 15 times as much as the total actual dust emission (similar to 2776 Tg); (2) the function of DAC ecosystems in preventing dust emissions was relatively strong in spring and winter; (3) grassland ecosystems had the strongest function in preventing dust emissions among all the land cover types, avoiding the emission of dust similar to 20,857 Tg over 2001-2020; (4) dust emission prevention function provided by the DAC ecosystems benefits almost every region of China, which provides a theoretical basis for formulating ecological compensation policies; and (5) the changes in dust emissions were dominated by wind speed in most areas of DAC.

However, little information is available regarding the impact of the continued use of BF on the soil environment and crop productivity. Therefore, we compared the effects of BF and PF on the soil total nitrogen (TN), soil organic carbon (SOC), soil carbon:nitrogen ratio (C:N), soil moisture, soil temperature (ST), leaf area index, accumulated aboveground biomass, grain yield, and water use efficiency (WUE) in the dryland of northwest China for four consecutive seasons. The results showed that BF and PF had similar effects on ST and soil moisture conservation in the early growth stage (0-60 days after sowing), but when the BF degraded, the ST and soil water content were significantly lower under BF than PF. After 60 days after sowing, the ST values were similar under BF and the control with no mulching (CK), which effectively alleviated the damage caused by high temperatures to a certain extent. The grain yield and WUE did not differ significantly under PF and BF, except in 2018. Compared with CK, the average grain yield and WUE increased by 12.8% and 6.8% under PF, respectively, and by 16.2% and 10.4% under BF. Both mulching methods reduced the SOC and TN contents in the 0-40 cm soil layer compared with the uncovered plots. However, they had different effects on the soil C:N where PF significantly reduced the C:N ratio whereas BF slightly increased it, thereby indicating that BF played an important role in maintaining the SOC and TN balance. Therefore, BF is recommended as a viable alternative to traditional PF for maize production in the dryland of northwest China. This study provides new evidence that BF can replace PF to address the problems of food security and residual film pollution in areas with similar conditions.

The current research status of drylands globally was reviewed together with a conceptual framework that included four key themes: (1) dryland social-ecological system dynamics and driving forces, (2) dryland social ecological system structure and functions, (3) dryland ecosystem services and human well-being in a changing environment and society, and (4) ecosystem management and sustainable livelihoods in drylands. The themes and their linkages were then analysed to outline three research priorities under each theme. The resulting conceptual framework and research priorities were proposed as the agenda of a new scientific programme, the Global Dryland Ecosystem Programme (Global-DEP), which is intended to facilitate actionable interdisciplinary research on drylands. This framework could be useful for wider dryland research and help meet the needs of practitioners and policymakers in drylands.

Compared with NM, PM and SM increased the grain yield by 26.0% and 15.6%, respectively. The soil bacterial community alpha-diversity was mainly affected by tillage, primarily because NT increased the soil water content (SWC) and reduced the destruction of microhabitats, thereby increasing the soil bacterial Chao1(by 4.3%) and Sobs (by 3.4%) indices compared with CT. The effect of mulching treatments on soil microbial community structure was greater than that of tillage treatments, confirmed by the distribution of treatment-sensitive OTUs (tsOTUs). The abundance of tsOTUs (e.g., Sphingomonadales and Sordariales) increased with PM due to higher soil temperature (Tem), leading to enhanced conversion of total nutrients into available nutrients and ultimately increasing grain yield. The SM positively affected the microbial (e.g., Burkholderiales and Sordariomycetes), mainly by increasing the SWC and total nitrogen content. However, low Tem (0.87 of the total effects) inhibited the positive effect of organic matter addition on grain yield under SM. Moreover, SM increased the stability of the co-occurrence network, which is reflected in keystone taxa, average clustering coefficient, and modularity. Mulching also increased the importance of stochasticity processes in soil bacterial communities, and the soil environmental variables (SOC, pH, etc.) were critical to the construction of communities.ConclusionCompared with SM, PM increases yield more, but input could also be increased because of depleting soil nutrients. At a low input level, SM increased the diversity and stability of the soil microbial community and maize yield. Overall, our findings indicate that SM is a promising approach for dryland farming systems.																			0032-079X	1573-5036				2023 OCT 20	2023										10.1007/s11104-023-06315-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-023-06315-w		OCT 2023											WOS:001087940800002

Identifying threshold responses of Australian dryland rivers to future hydroclimatic change	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Rivers provide crucial ecosystem services in water-stressed drylands. Australian dryland rivers are geomorphologically diverse, ranging from through-going, single channels to discontinuous, multi-channelled systems, yet we have limited understanding of their sensitivity to future hydroclimatic changes. Here, we characterise for the first time the geomorphology of 29 dryland rivers with catchments across a humid to arid gradient covering >1,800,000km(2) of continental eastern and central Australia. Statistical separation of five specific dominantly alluvial river types and quantification of their present-day catchment hydroclimates enables identification of potential thresholds of change. Projected aridity increases across eastern Australia by 2070 (RCP4.5) will result in similar to 80% of the dryland rivers crossing a threshold from one type to another, manifesting in major geomorphological changes. Dramatic cases will see currently through-going rivers (e.g. Murrumbidgee, Macintyre) experience step changes towards greater discontinuity, characterised by pronounced downstream declines in channel size and local termination. Expanding our approach to include other river styles (e.g. mixed bedrock-alluvial) would allow similar analyses of dryland rivers globally where hydroclimate is an important driver of change. Early identification of dryland river responses to future hydroclimatic change has far-reaching implications for the similar to 2 billion people that live in drylands and rely on riverine ecosystem services.

However, these predictions have not yet been observed in dryland vegetation due to the inherent logistic difficulty to gather longer-term in situ data. Here, we evaluate the theoretical prediction that regular vegetation patterns are associated with empirically derived temporal indicators (autocorrelation, variance, responsiveness) of critical slowing down in a dryland ecosystem in Sudan using different remote sensing products. We use recently developed methods using remote-sensing EVI time-series in combination with classified regular vegetation patterns along a rainfall gradient in Sudan to test the predicted slowing down. We tested our empirical findings against theoretical predictions from a stochastic version of a spatial explicit model that has been used to describe vegetation dynamics in drylands under aridity stress. Overall, three temporal indicators (responsiveness, temporal autocorrelation, variance) show slowing down as vegetation patterns change from gaps to labyrinths to spots towards more arid conditions, confirming predictions. However, this transition exhibits non-linearities, specifically when patterns change configuration. Model simulations reveal that the transition between patterns temporarily slows down the system affecting the temporal indicators. These transient states when vegetation patterns reorganize thus affect the systems resilience indicators in a non-linear way. Our findings suggest that spatial self-organization of dryland vegetation is associated with critical slowing down, but this transition towards reduced resilience happens in a non-linear way. Future work should aim to better understand transient dynamics in regular vegetation patterns in dryland ecosystems, because long transients make regular vegetation patterns of limited use for management in anticipating critical transitions.

J	Gao, X; Liu, LT; Liu, B				Gao, Xiang; Liu, Li-Tao; Liu, Bin			Dryland cyanobacterial exopolysaccharides show protection against acid deposition damage	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Soil surface-dwelling cyanobacteria constitute an important part of the dryland ecosystem. The exopolysaccharide (EPS) matrix they establish plays multiple roles in helping cells cope with harsh environments and also improves soil physicochemical properties. Anthropogenic atmospheric nitrogen or sulfur depositions have arisen as an important environmental change in drylands. The acid moisture derived from the depositions will be absorbed by cyanobacterial EPS matrix and thus may pose a threat to cells. In this communication, we evaluated this potential impact in a dryland cyanobacterium, Nostoc flagelliforme, which is a representative polysaccharide-rich species and shows remarkable resistance to desiccation stress. A strong and resilient pH buffering property was found for the EPS matrix, mainly of the polysaccharide's role, and this could protect the cells from acid damage of pH 4-6, a general acidity range of rainwater in the world. Unlike in acid aquatic environments, terrestrial xeric environments ensure N. flagelliforme unlikely to undertake lasting severe acidification. Thus, protection of the EPS matrix for dryland cyanobacteria would be conducive to sustain their growth and ecological roles in face of atmospheric acid pollution.

Soil organic carbon pools and soil quality indicators 3 and 24 years after a one-time compost application in organic dryland wheat systems	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Quantifying changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) is essential for understanding the effect of managements on carbon (C) sequestration, especially in cultivated marginal lands. The objectives of this study were to determine the short-(< 3 yr) and long-term (> 24 yr) effects of a one-time compost application on soil organic matter (SOM) pools and stocks: coarse particulate organic matter (cPOM), fine particulate organic matter (fPOM), mineral -associated organic matter (MAOM), and soil physical quality (SOC:clay ratio) in surface-and sub-soils. Manure compost (0, 25, and 50 Mg dry weight ha-1) was applied to three organic dryland winter wheat -fallow systems (WW-F): Historic, (HT, > 24 yr), Snowville (SN, < 3 yr), and Blue Creek (BC, < 3 yr), in north-ern Utah. At HT, cPOM-C concentrations in amended plots were higher than under the control plots at the 0-10-(84.6 vs 54.4 g OC kg-1 fraction) and 10-30-cm (34.4 vs 19.4 g OC kg-1 fraction) depth. Compared to control plots, compost increased MAOM-C concentration from 1.8 to 3.4 g OC kg-1 fraction at the 30-60-cm at SN and from 2.35 to 3.99 g OC kg-1 fraction at the 60-90-cm depth at BC. Similarly, cPOM-C concentration was also increased at SN (5.5-23.6 g OC kg(-1) fraction, 30-60-cm) and BC (8.3-31.2 g OC kg(-1) fraction, 60-90-cm). The SOC:clay ratio was significantly higher at the 30-60-cm depth at BC (1:50-1:40) and at the 60-90-cm depth at SN (1:70-1:30), which suggests that compost application can impact subsoil physical quality. Thus, one-time compost application at 16.5 Mg C ha-1 every two decades might constitute a reasonable management option for managing C in dryland WW-F agroecosystems.

Warm-season forage options in Northern Dryland Regions	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Rotating summer fallow with wheat (Triticum spp.) is done in dryland grain farming at upper latitudes to stabilize yields over time and to prevent crop failure. However, summer fallow is costly since weeds must be controlled and crops are not grown. Replacing summer fallow with grain crops can generate low economic returns. Previous research indicated that annual cool-season forages can be substituted for summer fallow in dryland cropping systems. Our objective was to determine if annual warm-season species were suited for forage production in monocultures and polycultures in the U.S. northern Great Plains. Dry matter (DM) production by 20 warm- and cool-season crop monocultures and 4 polycultures was determined across six environments during 2016, and by 25 warm- and cool-season crop monocultures and polycultures across four environments from 2016 through 2018. Maize (Zea mays L.) monoculture produced forage DM in amounts equal to, or greater than, those produced by other warm- and cool-season crop treatments (P < 0.05). Maize DM production averaged 2.5 to 5.7 Mg ha(-1), depending on the study and environment. Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), foxtail millet [Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv.] and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) also produced relatively large amounts of forage DM. Polycultures failed to produce more DM than monocultures consistently (P > 0.40). These results indicate that maize and other warm-season crops are adapted for dryland forage production in cool regions at upper latitudes. Additional research is needed to determine the impacts of annual warm-season forages on grain yield in a forage-wheat crop sequence.

Functional composition of plant communities mediates biomass effects on ecosystem service recovery across an experimental dryland restoration network	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												Land degradation can result in a loss of critical ecosystem services that we often seek to restore through re-establishment of desired plant communities. Trait-based approaches have the potential to target specific ecosystem services based on associations between the functional composition of plant communities and ecosystem properties that serve as indicators of those services. The effect of functional composition on ecosystem recovery may depend on the amount of restored plant biomass, itself a supporting service frequently targeted in restoration efforts. Yet, interactions between functional composition and biomass are not formally integrated into trait-based analytical frameworks. We tested the hypothesis that functional composition of plant communities both drives, and interacts with, biomass production to influence indicators of soil functioning and weed suppression across a network of degraded dryland restoration experiments. This networked approach allowed us to identify generalized effects of functional composition on ecosystem recovery across a range of dryland climate conditions. Climate had a substantial effect on ecosystem indicators, with weed cover and soil surface stability increasing in more arid climates, water infiltration increasing with precipitation, and aggregate structure increasing with less freezing. After accounting for climate effects across study sites, we found significant effects of community-weighted mean (CWM) trait values on biomass, particularly a positive effect of leaf carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, and of CWM-biomass interactions on other ecosystem indicators. Cover of exotic species was reduced in restored communities with a combination of low leaf dry matter content and high biomass, soil water infiltration increased with lower specific root length and high biomass, and soil aggregate stability increased with higher root dry matter content and high biomass, among other effects. Functional diversity had no significant effects on any ecosystem indicators. Synthesis: The influence of community functional composition on ecosystem properties increases with community biomass, particularly in disturbed or low productivity systems. This suggests that active management should not only focus on trait values that optimize individual ecosystem indicators but also how those functional strategies are complementary or counter to those that increase biomass.

Divergent climate change effects on widespread dryland plant communities driven by climatic and ecohydrological gradients	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Plant community response to climate change will be influenced by individual plant responses that emerge from competition for limiting resources that fluctuate through time and vary across space. Projecting these responses requires an approach that integrates environmental conditions and species interactions that result from future climatic variability. Dryland plant communities are being substantially affected by climate change because their structure and function are closely tied to precipitation and temperature, yet impacts vary substantially due to environmental heterogeneity, especially in topographically complex regions. Here, we quantified the effects of climate change on big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) plant communities that span 76 million ha in the western United States. We used an individual-based plant simulation model that represents intra- and inter-specific competition for water availability, which is represented by a process-based soil water balance model. For dominant plant functional types, we quantified changes in biomass and characterized agreement among 52 future climate scenarios. We then used a multivariate matching algorithm to generate fine-scale interpolated surfaces of functional type biomass for our study area. Results suggest geographically divergent responses of big sagebrush to climate change (changes in biomass of -20% to +27%), declines in perennial C-3 grass and perennial forb biomass in most sites, and widespread, consistent, and sometimes large increases in perennial C-4 grasses. The largest declines in big sagebrush, perennial C-3 grass and perennial forb biomass were simulated in warm, dry sites. In contrast, we simulated no change or increases in functional type biomass in cold, moist sites. There was high agreement among climate scenarios on climate change impacts to functional type biomass, except for big sagebrush. Collectively, these results suggest divergent responses to warming in moisture-limited versus temperature-limited sites and potential shifts in the relative importance of some of the dominant functional types that result from competition for limiting resources.

Bridging structural and functional hydrological connectivity in dryland ecosystems	CATENA												On dryland hillslopes, vegetation water availability is often subsidized by the redistribution of rainfall runoff from bare soil (sources) to vegetation patches (sinks). In regions where rainfall volumes are too low to support spatially continuous plant growth, such functional connectivity between bare soil and vegetated areas enables the establishment and persistence of dryland ecosystems. Increasing the connectivity within bare soil areas can intensify runoff and increase water losses from hillslopes, disrupting this redistribution and reducing the water available to sustain ecosystem function. Inferring functional connectivity (from bare to vegetated, or within bare areas) from structural landscape features is an attractive approach to enable rapid, scalable characterization of dryland ecosystem function from remote observations. Such inference, however, would rely on metrics of structural connectivity, which describe the contiguity of bare soil areas. Several studies have observed nonstationarity in the relations between functional and structural connectivity metrics as rainfall conditions vary. Consequently, the suitability of using structural connectivity to provide a reliable proxy for functional connectivity remains uncertain and motivates the work here.Relations between structural and functional connectivity metrics are established based on model simulations of rainfall-runoff on hillslopes with varying soil properties and vegetation patterns. These relations vary between two hydrologic limits - a 'local' (patch-scale) limit, in which functional connectivity is related to structural connectivity, and a 'global' (hillslope-scale) limit, in which functional connectivity is most related to the hillslope vegetation fraction regardless of the structural connectivity of bare soil areas. The transition between these limits within the simulations depends on rainfall intensity and duration, and soil permeability. While the local limit may strengthen positive feedbacks between vegetation and water availability, the implications of these limits for dryland functioning need further exploration, particularly considering the timescale separation between storm runoff production and vegetation growth.					; Katul, Gabriel/A-7210-2008	Thompson, Sally/0000-0003-4618-5066; Katul, Gabriel/0000-0001-9768-3693													0341-8162	1872-6887				OCT	2023	231								107322	10.1016/j.catena.2023.107322	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.107322		JUL 2023											WOS:001039111200001

Ecological impacts of invasive carp in Australian dryland rivers	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												Invasive carp are widely reported to harm ecosystems. In Australia, carp are a serious pest and, consequently, investigations of biocontrol options are under way. Best practice biocontrol requires cost/risk:benefit evaluation. To assist this, the impacts of carp on aquatic ecosystems have been summarized. To aid the evaluation of benefits, general predictions were tested by comparing dryland river ecosystems with and without carp, and ecosystem responses to a gradient in local carp density. Expectations were that in the presence of carp, and with increasing density, there would be increasing turbidity, decreasing densities of macrophytes and macroinvertebrates, and associated changes in assemblage composition, resulting in decreasing native fish density. Not all expected responses were found, indicating that the general understanding of carp impact requires modification for dryland rivers. Notably, carp did not increase turbidity or reduce macroinvertebrate density or composition, probably because of key attributes of dryland rivers. In contrast, there were large impacts on native fish biomass, not from the mechanisms expected, but from food resource monopolization by carp. Macrophyte occurrence was reduced, but macrophytes are naturally rare in these rivers. It is likely that the extirpation of an endangered river snail resulted from carp predation. Impacts on native fish may be reversible by carp control, but reversal of impacts on the snail may require carp elimination and snail reintroduction. Modelling is necessary to predict the probability of beneficial versus undesirable outcomes from carp control, and complementary measures to control other stressors may be needed. Benefits of carp control on dryland river ecosystems are fewer than generally predicted. This reinforces the point that ecological understanding cannot always be transferred between diverse settings and highlights the need to understand system characteristics relevant to causal impact pathways when applying generic carp impact models to specific settings.

Yet, adoption rates across water-limited farms in Texas remain low, especially among producers without irrigation access, due to concerns that cover crop use of soil moisture will negatively impact subsequent cash crop yields. This three-year cover crop trial in a rain-fed sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) farm in Lyford, Texas, trialed different cover crop mixes and seeding rates and confirmed that cover cropping leads to significant soil moisture deficits and cash crop failure when rainfall is low between cover crop termination and cash crop planting (<30 mm). In seasons one and three, moisture deficits contributed to significantly lower germination of post???cover crop sorghum compared to fallow control plots. In season two, increased precipitation during a longer moisture recharge period between cover crop termination and cash crop planting helped avoid sorghum yield drops. Length of recharge period, amount of rainfall, species selection, planting density, and termination method are major determinants of subsequent cash crop outcomes. Careful management can minimize some of the risks cover cropping poses to soil moisture, but without reliable rainfall at key points in the cropping cycle, cover cropping remains risky for farmers without irrigation access.																			0022-4561	1941-3300				MAY-JUN	2022	77	3					261	269		10.2489/jSWC.2022.00088	http://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jSWC.2022.00088													WOS:000798841800005

Drivers of seedling establishment success in dryland restoration efforts	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION												Restoration of degraded drylands is urgently needed to mitigate climate change, reverse desertification and secure livelihoods for the two billion people who live in these areas. Bold global targets have been set for dryland restoration to restore millions of hectares of degraded land. These targets have been questioned as overly ambitious, but without a global evaluation of successes and failures it is impossible to gauge feasibility. Here we examine restoration seeding outcomes across 174 sites on six continents, encompassing 594,065 observations of 671 plant species. Our findings suggest reasons for optimism. Seeding had a positive impact on species presence: in almost a third of all treatments, 100% of species seeded were growing at first monitoring. However, dryland restoration is risky: 17% of projects failed, with no establishment of any seeded species, and consistent declines were found in seeded species as projects matured. Across projects, higher seeding rates and larger seed sizes resulted in a greater probability of recruitment, with further influences on species success including site aridity, taxonomic identity and species life form. Our findings suggest that investigations examining these predictive factors will yield more effective and informed restoration decision-making. The seeding of native species is critical to the success of dryland restoration efforts. Here the authors evaluate success of seeding establishment at 174 sites on six continents, finding that some sites had nearly 100% of species successfully recruit, while 17% of sites had zero seedling success.

Research on dryland ecological restoration is very important in ensuring national food security, ecological security, and preventing a return to poverty. However, the previous research results do not clearly present the interconnection between the huge number of existing dryland ecological restoration studies and do not provide a three-dimensional understanding of the whole picture of dryland ecological restoration research from a broader perspective. Research on dryland ecological restoration has received wide attention from scholars at home and abroad, revealing the international research trends in the current field, which will provide a reference for the theory and practice of future dryland ecological restoration research. Using the SCI-E and SSCI databases of the "Web of Science Core Collection" as sample data sources and using CiteSpace optical measurement software, the 2254 literature in the field of international dryland ecological restoration research were systematically analyzed to track the situation and impact of research in this field by countries around the world, scientific research institutions and significant authors, and to analyze the interdisciplinary and research hotspots in this field, which is of great significance for the follow-up research of dryland ecological restoration. The research results show that: (1) The number of publications in international dryland ecological restoration has increased significantly with years and has strong development potential. (2) Journals representing the research frontier have an intense concentration with various journals. (3) The study of dryland ecological restoration belongs to a highly interdisciplinary discipline, while the two disciplines of ecology and environmental science are the pivot nodes of multidisciplinary disciplines. (4) China's posts and total citations are among the best, but the average citation is low. (5) Dryland ecological restoration and protection is a hot research field at present, and special attention is paid to the dynamic changes and key driving factors of dryland ecological restoration and the full use of machine learning and extensive data mining to solve complex social-ecological problems. The study recommends that related disciplines must strengthen cooperation in the field of dryland ecological restoration, especially the two disciplines of ecology and environmental science, in order to promote the progress of dryland ecological restoration research theory and practice. China should continue to strengthen the investment of scientific research forces to improve the international influence of research in the field of dryland ecological restoration.

Annual precipitation explains variability in dryland vegetation greenness globally but not locally	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Dryland vegetation productivity is strongly modulated by water availability. As precipitation patterns and variability are altered by climate change, there is a pressing need to better understand vegetation responses to precipitation variability in these ecologically fragile regions. Here we present a global analysis of dryland sensitivity to annual precipitation variations using long-term records of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We show that while precipitation explains 66% of spatial gradients in NDVI across dryland regions, precipitation only accounts for <26% of temporal NDVI variability over most (>75%) dryland regions. We observed this weaker temporal relative to spatial relationship between NDVI and precipitation across all global drylands. We confirmed this result using three alternative water availability metrics that account for water loss to evaporation, and growing season and precipitation timing. This suggests that predicting vegetation responses to future rainfall using space-for-time substitution will strongly overestimate precipitation control on interannual variability in aboveground growth. We explore multiple mechanisms to explain the discrepancy between spatial and temporal responses and find contributions from multiple factors including local-scale vegetation characteristics, climate and soil properties. Earth system models (ESMs) from the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project overestimate the observed vegetation sensitivity to precipitation variability up to threefold, particularly during dry years. Given projections of increasing meteorological drought, ESMs are likely to overestimate the impacts of future drought on dryland vegetation with observations suggesting that dryland vegetation is more resistant to annual precipitation variations than ESMs project.

While continued drying and warming may alter process rates and deteriorate the state and performance of ecosystems, it could also lead to more fundamental changes in the mechanisms governing ecosystem functioning. Here we argue that climate change will induce unprecedented shifts in these mechanisms in historically wetter climatic zones, towards mechanisms currently prevalent in dry regions, which we refer to as 'dryland mechanisms'. We discuss 12 dryland mechanisms affecting multiple processes of ecosystem functioning, including vegetation development, water flow, energy budget, carbon and nutrient cycling, plant production and organic matter decomposition. We then examine mostly rare examples of the operation of these mechanisms in non-dryland regions where they have been considered irrelevant at present. Current and future climate trends could force microclimatic conditions across thresholds and lead to the emergence of dryland mechanisms and their increasing control over ecosystem functioning in many biomes on Earth. In drylands, there are unique mechanisms that influence multiple ecosystem processes. In this Perspective, the authors identify these dryland mechanisms and show that they could become more important in non-dryland regions or areas that will become drier in the future.

Differences in forest type, including those in the predominant mycorrhizal type, can have varying effects on soil N transformation. Therefore, we hypothesised that the response of the N transformation processes to rainfall events would differ between forest types, even those that are adjacently located. In this study, we generated a soil moisture gradient in adjacent dryland black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia, non-ectomycorrhizal [ECM]-type) and oak (Quercus liaotungensis, ECM-type) forests and measured the abundance and community composition of fungi and prokaryotes (including ammonia-oxidisers), extractable N content, and net N transformation rates in the soil. Increasing moisture was found to increase nitrate N content in the black locust forest but not in the oak forest. In the oak forest, the abundance of ECM fungi increased with increasing moisture, subsequently enhancing ECM fungal ammonium N uptake and limiting the N availability for ammonia oxidisers, which may reduce the nitrate N production by ammonia-oxidisers. Increased nitrate N uptake by ECM fungi may also result in low soil nitrate N content. The findings of this study indicate that the responses of the nitrate N dynamics to rainfall events can differ between adjacent forests and that this difference may be attributable to the presence of ECM fungi. Therefore, considering the forest mycorrhizal type is vital for predicating the response of forest N cycling under climate change.

In this study we explored the impact of combinations of soil management practices on microbial diversity and community composition in a dryland soybean production system. Soil samples were collected from the experimental field maintained under no till, cover crops, and fertility treatments, at Pontotoc Ridge-Flatwoods Branch Experiment Station, MS, USA. Targeted amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA and ITS2 genes was used to study the bacterial and fungal community composition. Poultry litter amendment and cover crops significantly influenced soil bacterial diversity. Fertilizer sources had significantly different bacterial communities, as specific microbial taxa were strongly influenced by the changes in the nutrient availability, while cover crops influenced the soil fungal community differences. Differential enrichment of advantageous bacterial (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria) and fungal (Mortierellomycota) phyla was observed across the treatments. Soil pH and easily extractable glomalin-related soil proteins (EE-GRSP) were correlated with bacterial communities and aggregate stability (WSA) was influenced by the poultry litter amendment, thus driving the differences in bacterial and fungal communities. These findings suggest that a long-term study would provide more inferences on soil microbial community response to management changes in these dryland soybean production systems.

Polyacrylamide (PAM) soil amendments are increasingly used to remediate these degraded lands with the potential benefits on soil health and crop production. However, the scientific evidence of farm-scale use of one-time versus repeated application of PAM has not been reported. The specific objective of this research was to determine the effects of single versus multiple annual PAM application on (a) the dynamic changes in soil quality parameters and (b) oat crop productivity indicators in a dryland farming ecosystem. Our data illustrated that multiple years of annual application of PAM significantly increased soil profile water storage, whereas it reduced soil bulk density and electrical conductivity in the top (0-20 cm) and deeper layers (20-60 cm) over those for the control or single PAM application. The improved soil microecological environments led to increased activities of soil enzymes urease (up to 106%), invertase (94%), and catalase (45%). These in turn promoted soil nutrient turnover and availability (e.g., 76% higher soil alkaline N) and crop growth leading to the improvement in grain protein (up to 31%), protein yield (58%), and partial factor productivity of nitrogen (20%), than did the control treatment. Taken together, these soil and crop performance indicators suggest that repeated annual PAM application for a minimum of 2-3 years would be an effective strategy to combat drought and land degradation and foster sustainable crop production in dryland agriculture under a changing climate scenario.					liu, jinghui/IAP-8628-2023	Ma, Bin/0000-0003-3326-2317													1085-3278	1099-145X				MAY 30	2020	31	9					1176	1192		10.1002/ldr.3482	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.3482		JAN 2020											WOS:000509649000001

Shifting the odds of dryland farming: The career of BA Stewart	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Raised on a small dairy farm in semi-arid western Oklahoma, Dr. B.A. Stewart was involved in agricultural challenges at an early age. Attending Oklahoma A&M College in Stillwater, he became enthralled by the power of chemistry and biology to address agricultural problems. He began a soil science career, first in Stillwater and later with the then new USDA Agricultural Research Service in Fort Collins, CO. Working on nitrogen pollution from feedlots, he developed new nitrogen assay methods, became involved in environmental work, and assisted in focusing the early work of the Environmental Protection Agency. In 1963, Stewart became Director of the USDA ARS Laboratory at Bushland, TX, where he developed programs in nitrogen and phosphorus management in dryland and irrigated agriculture, became a recognized proponent of soil and water conservation, worked with the beef cattle industry, and developed programs in dryland and irrigated cropping systems, including evapotranspiration measurement and modeling. Stewart became involved internationally through his work with USAID and ICARDA, service as Editor-in-Chief for the SSSA Journal, and editing of the book series, Advances in Soil Science, from 1985 to 2018. This led to the 1988 International Conference on Dryland Farming at Bushland. The 460 participants from 52 countries and 36 states defined the challenges in research and policy to develop future successful dryland farming. In 1993, Stewart retired from USDA ARS and became the first director of the Dryland Agriculture Institute at West Texas A&M University, teaching and researching with 74 successful M.S. and Ph.D. students over 24 years.																			0002-1962	1435-0645				SEP-OCT	2020	112	5					3254	3264		10.1002/agj2.20260	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.20260													WOS:000600983000004

A better understanding of the biomass allocation mechanisms that enable modern wheat to achieve higher yields and yield-based water use efficiency (WUEg) is essential for implementing best management strategies and identifying phenotypic traits for cultivar improvement. We systematically investigated the biomass allocation, morphological and physiological characteristics of three ploidy wheat genotypes under 80% and 50% field water-holding capacity (FC) conditions. Some crucial traits were also assessed in a complementary field experiment. RESULTS The diploid and tetraploid genotypes were found to allocate more biomass to the root system, especially roots in the topsoil under drought stress. Our data illustrated that lower WUEg and yield of these old genotypes were due to excessive investment in the root system, which was associated with severely restricted canopy development. Modern hexaploid genotypes were found to allocate smaller biomass to roots and larger biomass to shoots. This not only ensured the necessary water uptake, but also allowed the plant to distribute more assimilates and limited water to the shoots. Therefore, the hexaploid genotypes have evolved a stable plant canopy structure to optimize WUEg and grain yield. CONCLUSION This study demonstrated that the biomass shift from below ground to above ground or a more balanced root:shoot ratio tended to optimize water use and yield of the modern cultivars. This discovery provides potential guidance for future dryland wheat breeding and sustainable management strategies.

Soil inorganic carbon under no-till dryland crop rotations	AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES & ENVIRONMENT												Soil inorganic carbon (SIC) constitutes a large proportion of soil total carbon (STC) under dryland cropping systems in arid and semiarid regions. Information on the effect of management practices on SIC is scarce. We evaluated the effect of 1- to 4-yr no-till diversified crop rotations on SIC at the 0- to 120-cm depth in Sidney and Friod, MT. The SIC increased from the soil surface to 90-cm depth and then declined. Crop rotations did not affect SIC and STC, except at 90-120 cm in Sidney where barley (Hordeum vulgare L) and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L) in rotation with pea (Pisum sativum L.) had higher SIC than other crop rotations. The SIC contributed from 0% of STC at 0-15 cm for most crop rotations to 78% at 60-90 cm for barley-pea rotation. Long-term studies are needed to evaluate the effect of dryland crop rotations on SIC in the northern Great Plains.

During natural or artificial restoration, dryland ecosystems tend to contain a unique community, namely, biocrusts. Studies have shown that biocrusts serve multiple functions and have the potential to accelerate or inhibit degradation. However, the mechanisms by which biocrusts mediate dryland plant community structure and composition remain largely unknown. In this study, we performed a series of pot experiments under greenhouse conditions at three disturbance levels (strong, moderate and no disturbance) and at three rainfall gradients (- 50 %, normal, + 50 %) for different biocrust types. Our objective was to examine how biocrusts influence the introduction and establishment of different functional forms of plant species during the different succession stages of dryland recovery. Our results showed that biocrusts have significantly different effects on the seed germination and survival of the tested plant species. Although strong disturbances to the biocrusts and increasing rainfall alleviated the inhibitory effects of biocrusts on the perennial herb (S. glareosa) and subshrub (C. latens) species, these factors could only promote the temporary survival of these two plants in the revegetated area. These results indicate that biocrusts in revegetated systems play important sieving functions during plant species establishment. Additionally, the survival of S. viridis, a plant species with small seeds adapted to the current habitat, was promoted in the community, but two plant species that are currently unsuitable, S. glareosa and C. latens, were filtered out by the biocrusts. Our conclusions suggest that biocrusts play an ecological filtering role in plant species introduction and establishment in revegetated ecosystems and demonstrate the scientific significance of biocrusts in maintaining the health and stability of dryland ecosystems.

Duma florulenta (lignum) is a keystone species that facilitates biodiversity in the floodplains and wetlands of Australia's dryland river systems. This paper explores spatial genetic structure of lignum and investigates factors influencing dispersal and gene flow within and among river catchments of the northern Murray-Darling Basin. Location Northern Murray-Darling Basin, eastern Australia. Methods A total of 122 individual plants from subpopulations located on rivers in four adjacent catchments were genotyped using 10 microsatellite markers. Microsatellite data were then analyzed using population genetic techniques to evaluate levels of gene flow and genetic structure and identify factors influencing dispersal. Results Results suggest high levels of gene flow between lignum subpopulations of the northern Murray-Darling Basin. AMOVA revealed small but significant differences between subpopulations, and STRUCTURE analysis did not detect meaningful structure when sampling information was not provided. However, when sampling information was supplied using the LOCPRIOR model, three genetic clusters were identified. All Lower Balonne subpopulations were assigned to cluster 1 while a number of the other subpopulations showed mixed ancestry. Weak relationships were identified between pairwise genetic distance and geographic as well as river distance, although the R-2 value of the former was only half that of the latter. Main conclusions Patterns of genetic variation suggest frequent long-distance overland gene flow largely as a result of the movement of seeds via floodwater. Therefore, maintenance of natural variability in flow regime is key both to maintain conditions favorable to recruitment and to promote dispersal and gene flow across the landscape. However, given future climate change projections persistence may be more reliant on the species ability to endure long periods of drought between flood events.

Reconstructing Late Quaternary Palaeo-environmental change from the dryland fluvial landscape of the Southern Kachchh Mainland, western India: Insights from new OSL and sedimentological datasets	GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL												The southern Kachchh Mainland (SKM) of western India, situated in a seismically active intraplate region with a considerable Quaternary landscape, provides an opportunity to reconstruct the roles of climate and tectonics. Employing geomorphology, detailed sedimentology supported by geochemistry and optical dating, we integrate the fluvial to fluvio-marine records to evaluate the potential of dryland environments in archiving the palaeo-events. The climate reconstructions suggest that the fluvial systems have responded to the variations in monsoonal strength through widespread aggradation during 57 until 41 ka, corresponding to the later part of the MIS-3. Following this, a relative weakening of monsoon and onset of aridity is observed between 28 and 11 ka, with short spells of enhanced monsoon. The monsoonal conditions again strengthened during 11 to 6 ka, reaching its maximum during the Early Holocene optima, which triggered a sea-level rise during the Middle Holocene period, that is, 6 to 3 ka. Following this, the sequences incised in response to the relative sea-level fall to the present level in post 3 ka. We have also employed this OSL ages to reconstruct the phases of aggradation and incision of valley fill sediments/estuarine tidal terraces from the SKM during the last 57 ka. The present study illustrates and contributes to the advancement in understanding of complex processes and their influence on climatic/tectonic signals in dryland landscape as well as their decoupling.

Dryland changes under different levels of global warming	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Drylands are vital ecosystems which cover almost 47% of the Earth's surface, hosting 39% of the global population. Dryland areas are highly sensitive to climatic changes and substantial impacts are foreseen under a warming climate. Many studies have examined the evolution of drylands in the future highlighting the need for improved capability of climate models to simulate aridity. The present study takes advantage of new higher resolution climate projections by the HadGEM3A Atmosphere Global Climate Model using prescribed time varying SSTs and sea ice, provided by a range of CMIP5 climate models under RCP8.5. The aim of the higher resolution models is to examine the benefit of the improved representation of atmospheric processes in the dryland research and to see where these results lie in the range of results from previous studies using the original CMIP5 ensemble. The transient response of aridity from the recent past until the end of the 21st century was examined as well as the expansion of global drylands under specific levels of global warming (1.5 degrees C, 2 degrees C and 4 degrees C). Dryland changes were further assessed at the watershed level for a number of major global river basins to discuss implications on hydrological changes and land degradation. The areal coverage of drylands could increase by an additional 7% of the global land surface by 2100 under high end climate change. At a 4 degrees C warmer world above pre-industrial, 11.2% of global land area is projected to shift towards drier types and 4.24% to wetter. At the same level of warming the number of humans projected to live in drylands varies between 3.3 and 5.2 billion, depending on the socioeconomic developments. By keeping global warming levels to 1.5 degrees C, up to 1.9 billion people could avoid living in drylands compared to a 4 degrees C warmer world of low environmental concern. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Improved dryland carbon flux predictions with explicit consideration of water-carbon coupling	COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT												Dryland ecosystems are dominant influences on both the trend and interannual variability of the terrestrial carbon sink. Despite their importance, dryland carbon dynamics are not well-characterized by current models. Here, we present DryFlux, an upscaled product built on a dense network of eddy covariance sites in the North American Southwest. To estimate dryland gross primary productivity, we fuse in situ fluxes with remote sensing and meteorological observations using machine learning. DryFlux explicitly accounts for intra-annual variation in water availability, and accurately predicts interannual and seasonal variability in carbon uptake. Applying DryFlux globally indicates existing products may underestimate impacts of large-scale climate patterns on the interannual variability of dryland carbon uptake. We anticipate DryFlux will be an improved benchmark for earth system models in drylands, and prompt a more sensitive accounting of water limitation on the carbon cycle. Upscaling in situ carbon flux measurements using remotely sensed and meteorological observations in a machine learning algorithm leads to improved estimates of average uptake, and interannual variability in global drylands.

Climate legacies drive the distribution and future restoration potential of dryland forests	NATURE PLANTS												Knowing the extent and environmental drivers of forests is key to successfully restore degraded ecosystems, and to mitigate climate change and desertification impacts using tree planting. Water availability is the main limiting factor for the development of forests in drylands, yet the importance of groundwater resources and palaeoclimate as drivers of their current distribution has been neglected. Here we report that mid-Holocene climates and aquifer trends are key predictors of the distribution of dryland forests worldwide. We also updated the global extent of dryland forests to 1,283 million hectares and showed that failing to consider past climates and aquifers has resulted in ignoring or misplacing up to 130 million hectares of forests in drylands. Our findings highlight the importance of a wetter past and well-preserved aquifers to explain the current distribution of dryland forests, and can guide restoration actions by avoiding unsuitable areas for tree establishment in a drier world. Combining very high-resolution imagery of dryland forests worldwide with climate and aquifer data from the mid-Holocene period, this paper illustrates how geological forces of the past shaped today's forests.

This study aimed to evaluate N2O emissions, annualized crop grain yield, emission factor, and yield-scaled- and NUE-scaled N2O emissions under continuous spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (CW) and spring wheat-pea (Pisum sativum L.) (WP) rotations with four N fertilization rates (0, 50, 100, and 150 kg N ha(-1)). The N2O fluxes peaked immediately after N fertilization, intense precipitation, and snowmelt, which accounted for 75-85% of the total annual flux. Cumulative N2O flux usually increased with increased N fertilization rate in all crop rotations and years. Annualized crop yield and NUE were greater in WP than CW for 0 kg N ha(-1) in all years, but the trend reversed with 100 kg N ha(-1) in 2013 and 2015. Crop yield maximized at 100 kg N ha(-1), but NUE declined linearly with increased N fertilization rate in all crop rotations and years. As N fertilization rate increased, N fertilizer-scaled N2O flux decreased, but NUE-scaled N2O flux increased non-linearly in all years, regardless of crop rotations. The yield-scaled N2O flux decreased from 0 to 50 kg N ha(-1) and then increased with increased N fertilization rate. Because of non-significant difference of N2O fluxes between 50 and 100 kg N ha(-1), but increased crop yield, N2O emissions can be minimized while dryland crop yields and NUE can be optimized with 100 kg N ha(-1), regardless of crop rotations.

Soil health within transitions from irrigation to limited irrigation and dryland management	AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL LETTERS												The decline in groundwater supply in the Texas High Plains is forcing some growers to convert center-pivot irrigated cropland to dryland production. Transitioning toward reduced water input can lead to declines in soil health. We assessed short-term changes in soil health indicators in two transition scenarios: (a) from high irrigation method to low irrigation method (center pivot to subsurface drip) and (b) from high irrigation method to dryland (center pivot to dryland), in comparison to continuous center-pivot management. We monitored changes in chemical and biological indicators in four fields for each transition scenario and in three pivot-irrigated fields. There were declines in soil water content, potassium (K), sodium (Na), and soil organic carbon with transition from irrigation to reduced irrigation and dryland. Severe drought in the final year revealed reduced amounts of multi-enzyme activities, total ester-linked fatty acid methyl ester (EL-FAME), and total fungi. Transitioning to low water-input management in this environment complicates efforts to maintain microbial components of soil health. Longer-term comparisons are needed to detect slow changes in soil health indicators on producers' fields.

However, farm households in this region have been facing frequent droughts, water resource shortages, severe soil erosion and other problems; their livelihood security has been seriously threatened. This study used a livelihood resilience framework to evaluate farm households' livelihood resilience in dryland areas through the field survey data and identified the influencing factors of livelihood resilience using the GeoDetector and the Lindeman, Merenda and Gold method (LMG) from the family life cycle perspective. The results revealed the following points: (1) there were significant differences in livelihood resilience, adaptive capacity and anticipatory capacity at each stage of the family life cycle at a 5% significant level. (2) The top two variables of livelihood resilience were preparedness and planning, and substitutable assets, followed by household characteristics. With the evolution of the family life cycle, the impacts of family assets and basic service access on livelihood resilience showed a "U" trend. On the contrary, savings and safety nets showed an inverted "U" shape. (3) Both the GeoDetector and LMG metric models could identify the key influencing factors, but the variable importance rankings of the two models were different to some degree. Finally, based on the results of the analysis, this study proposed targeted policy recommendations for building livelihood resilience of farm households.																				2073-445X				SEP	2022	11	9							1427	10.3390/land11091427	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11091427													WOS:000857088300001

Genotypic confirmation of a biased phenotypic sex ratio in a dryland moss using restriction fragment length polymorphisms	APPLICATIONS IN PLANT SCIENCES												Premise In dioicous mosses, sex is determined by a single U (female, female) or V (male, male) chromosome. Although a 1 : 1 sex ratio is expected following meiosis, phenotypic sex ratios based on the production of gametangia are often female-biased. The dryland moss Syntrichia caninervis (Pottiaceae) is notable for its low frequency of sex expression and strong phenotypic female bias. Here we present a technique to determine genotypic sex in a single shoot of S. caninervis, and report results of a case study examining genotypic and phenotypic sex ratios. Methods We reanalyzed 271 non-expressing gametophyte shoots from a previous study on S. caninervis sex expression across microhabitats using a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method. Results We recovered a genotypic sex ratio in non-expressing shoots of 18.4 female : 1 male, which exceeds the female bias of the phenotypic ratio (5.3 female : 1 male; P = 0.013). We also found that the distribution of male and female genotypes across microsites with different levels of sun exposure was not predicted by patterns of sex expression in these microsites. Discussion These findings contribute to our understanding of how the environment may modulate sex ratios in S. caninervis, either through its direct influence on sex expression or through selection on genotypes with particular sex expression phenotypes.

Thus, to understand how climate change may affect the global carbon cycle, we must also be able to understand and model its effects on dryland vegetation. Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) are an important tool for modeling ecosystem dynamics, but they often struggle to reproduce seasonal patterns of plant productivity. Because the phonological niche of many plant species is linked to both total productivity and competitive interactions with other plants, errors in how process-based models represent phenology hinder our ability to predict climate change impacts. This may be particularly problematic in dryland ecosystems where many species have developed a complex phonology in response to seasonal variability in both moisture and temperature. Here, we examine how uncertainty in key parameters as well as the structure of existing phonology routines affect the ability of a DGVM to match seasonal patterns of leaf area index (LAI) and gross primary productivity (GPP) across a temperature and precipitation gradient. First, we optimized model parameters using a combination of site-level eddy covariance data and remotely-sensed LAI data. Second, we modified the model to include a semi-deciduous phonology type and added flexibility to the representation of grass phonology. While optimizing parameters reduced model bias, the largest gains in model performance were associated with the development of our new representation of phenology. This modified model was able to better capture seasonal patterns of both leaf area index (R-2 = 0.75) and gross primary productivity (R-2 = 0.84), though its ability to estimate total annual GPP depended on using eddy covariance data for optimization. The new model also resulted in a more realistic outcome of modeled competition between grass and shrubs. These findings demonstrate the importance of improving how DGVMs represent phonology in order to accurately forecast climate change impacts in dryland ecosystems.

The soil properties, root-shoot growth of rapeseed, and the yield of the three crops were collected to evaluate the effects of these tillage modes. Sub-T significantly reduced soil bulk density (SBD) and penetration resistance (PR) in PF and DL, while it increased the pH in PF, the concentration of moisture and total nitrogen, organic matter, alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen, available phosphorus, available potassium in the 10-30 cm soil layers, and the activities of catalase, sucrose, urease, and acid phosphatase in the 10-20 cm soil as compared with Top-T. Furthermore, Sub-T significantly enhanced root bleeding sap (RBS), indole acetic acid, cytokinin, zeatin, and gibberellin concentration but decreased abscisic acid concentration. A principal component analysis showed that Sub-T could improve RBS and root hormones and promote the biomass accumulation of root and shoot by reducing SBD and PR and increasing nutrients in 10-30 cm soil. Finally, Sub-T significantly increased the seed yield of rapeseed by 2-16.5 % and did not have any significant negative effect on rice and soybean yield under NT in the next season, whereas, the rapeseed yield was significantly reduced by 22.9-36.2 % under Top-T, the rice, and soybean yield were significantly reduced by 33.6-41.1 % and by 26.0-41.9 % under NT in the next season, respectively, when compared to those under conventional tillage (CT, involved moldboard plowing to 15-18 cm and rotary tillage to 10-15 cm). Consequently, favorable soil conditions provided by Sub-T lasted for the next season, as rapeseed growth and grain yield were significantly promoted, and both the rice and soybean yield can also be maintained under NT.

However, the literature lacks data about the milling performance of these varieties, as well as about the effects of genotypes, environment and genotype x environment interaction. The current study aimed to evaluate the milling yield, as well as whole, broken, white-belly and chalky grains, in experiments designed in complete randomized blocks, with four replications, in two sites. The rates for milling yield and whole and broken grains were, respectively, 57.93-69.90 %, 38.73-66.0 % and 3.40-22.15 %, with 15 local varieties reaching values similar to those recorded for modern dryland rice varieties. The Anchieta county (origin of the varieties) recorded the highest values for milling yield and whole grain. The incidence rates for white-belly and chalky grains were, respectively, 0.10-8.68 % and 0.02-3.12 %. Significant differences (p <= 0.05) were observed for genotype, environment and genotype x environment interaction effects, concerning the milling yield. For whole and broken grains, the differences were significant (p <= 0.05) for genotype and environment, but not significant for genotype x environment interaction. For white-belly and chalky grains, the differences were significant (p <= 0.05) for genotype and genotype x environment interaction, but not significant for environment. For all the studied milling yield variables, differences were observed for the varieties' stability, as well as established a stability ranking.					Reichert, Francisco W.

This study investigated the interactive effect of [CO2] and soil type on growth, yield and water use of canola (Brassica napus L.) in a dryland environment.MethodsTwo canola cultivars (vigorous hybrid cv. Hyola 50' and non-hybrid cv. Thumper') were grown in large intact soil cores containing either a sandy Calcarosol or clay Vertosol under current ambient (a[CO2]) and future elevated [CO2] (e[CO2]), approximate to 550molmol(-1)). Net assimilation rates (A(net)), stomatal conductance (g(s)) and leaf area were measured throughout the growing season. Seed yield and yield components were recorded at final harvest. Water use was monitored by lysimeter balances.ResultsElevated [CO2]-stimulation of iWUE was greater than the effect on leaf area, therefore, water use was lower under e[CO2] than a[CO2], but this was further modified by soil type and cultivar. The dynamics of water use throughout the growing season were different between the studied cultivars and in line with their leaf development. The effect of e[CO2] on seed yield was dependent on cultivar; the non-hybrid cultivar benefitted more from increased [CO2]. Although textural differences between soil types influenced the water use under e[CO2], this did not affect the CO2 fertilisation effect' on the studied canola cultivars.ConclusionElevated [CO2]-induced water savings observed in the present study is a potential mechanism of ameliorating drought effects in high CO2 environment. Better understanding of genotypic variability in response to water use dynamics with traits affecting assimilate supply and use can help breeders to improve crop germplasm for future climates.

Chronostratigraphy of talus flatirons and piedmont alluvium along the Book Cliffs, Utah - Testing models of dryland escarpment evolution	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Research on the evolution of dryland escarpments and what drives and controls their erosional retreat have been limited by a lack of chronologically constrained records. Prior investigations of escarpments in the southwestern U.S. and globally garner two endmember conceptual models - one focused on bottom-up baselevel drivers and autogenic variations in piedmont and toeslope erosion processes, the other focused on the role of climate as a top-down forcing mechanism on sediment production and transport from cliffs. We test these conceptual models along a section of the Book Cliffs in central Utah, where climate has varied strongly and baselevel has fallen significantly over the late Quaternary. Four generations of talus flatirons and piedmont terraces are preserved in the study area we date them by optically stimulated luminescence and Be-10-exposure techniques. OSL depositional ages cluster into four generations of deposits with mean ages and mean standard errors of 117.8 +/- 6.7 ka, 83.4 +/- 3.3 ka, 52.4 +/- 1.8 ka, and 5.6 +/- 0.3 ka. Be-10-exposure results from talus boulders protruding from flatirons confirm that the youngest generation of talus is Holocene, with recent rock-fall boulders still being received on the landform top. Older flatiron generations produce incoherent, minimum exposure ages reflecting an increasing dominance of in situ boulder weathering and a steady-state denudation rate of similar to 45 mm/Icy after tens of thousands of years. Based on the chronostratgraphy and correlation of talus and piedmont deposits, we interpret climate as the primary control on escarpment evolution. Depositional ages do not correspond to glacial epochs as historically presumed, but instead to episodes of intermediate and unstable or variable Pleistocene climate during Marine Isotope Stage-3 and 5 a/b. Results support the significance of high climate variability at millennial timescales in driving both sediment production by mass wasting from the cliff as well as sediment storage and reworking along the piedmont. In contrast, wetter climates of glacial epochs apparently caused greater erosion and sediment transport to trunk drainages. Our chronology also reveals a systematic decrease in deposit age with increasing distance up the piedmont from the regional baselevel of the Price River, consistent with transient fluvial incision and terrace abandonment. The Book Cliffs record notably does not correlate with similarly constrained records in Spain or the contrasting record from the Negev, yet they all share the feature of enhanced talus deposition and cliff retreat corresponding to climate instability rather than in response to steady glacial-climate conditions. Thus, we outline a model of escarpment evolution and retreat governed largely by top-down climate-forcing of sediment production and transport during climate variability, with local changes in baselevel and erosional processes on the piedmont being a modifying, secondary factor.

Improving dryland seedling recruitment using fungicide seed coatings	ECOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS AND EVIDENCE												The success of seed-based restoration in dryland regions of the world is often low or sporadic, with most mortality occurring between germination and emergence. Fungal pathogenesis is one process that may reduce seedling emergence and limit restoration success. Our objective was to determine whether fungicide seed coatings constitute an economically viable strategy for increasing emergence by reducing fungal pathogenesis and mortality. We performed an experiment across two sites and three years, using bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata) as a model species. We found that fungicide coatings increased germination by 8.8% and emergence by 54.0% on average compared to the control. A cost analysis indicated that the fungicide coating was economically viable with an average estimated effective cost reduction of 18.8% under the study conditions. There was a strong interaction (P < 0.001) between the effects of the fungicide coating, site and year on emergence. The fungicide coating increased emergence compared to the control in five of the six sites and years, with the effect ranging from a 33.7% decrease (P = 0.042) to a 150.9% increase (P = 0.004). The observed interaction was likely related to the effect of the hydrothermal microsite environment on disease severity. In the site and year that the fungicide coating performed worse than the control, prolonged periods of exceptionally low soil moisture may have reduced disease severity through a variety of individual and community scale mechanisms. Overall, these results indicate that fungicide seed coatings have the potential to improve dryland restoration efforts.

It is crucial to examine factors impacting farm productivity, such as socio, structural, and Circular Economy (CE) factors, in order to ensure the sustainability of varied farms. A decision to follow a farm circularity approach is required to increase agricultural production, return on investment, and achieve sustainability, so the current study was designed to move forward in identifying farm efficiency and their influencing drivers in production systems for the successful execution of circularity in future farms. The objective of this paper is to find the existing operational efficiency of farms, variables that impact a farm's efficiency, the disparities in farm efficiency, and variables dominating farm efficiency. The efficiency behaviours of Indian farms operating in 2020-2022 were studied and regressed against the factors influencing farm performance. A two-step technique and survey data were employed. To assess variations in the relevance of drivers, an input-oriented Data Envelopment Analysis was employed; in the second stage, efficiency ratings were used as a dependent variable in a Tobit regression analysis. Explanatory variables for enhancing farm performance included social, structural, and Circular Economy (CE) drivers. The age of the farmer, total farm area, and dryland area as socio-structural variables, and reduce, recycle, and redesign as CE variables, have proven to affect the farm's efficiencies significantly. Managerial implications in terms of technical, allocative, cost efficiency, and their drivers have been drawn from study findings. CE has been confirmed to be the strategy over which the farmer has complete control and has been found to have a more significant impact on farm efficiency. Social structural determents are second in terms of their impact. Farmers in the region have cushy access to inputs; however, they are not utilized to their maximum effect. Therefore, the study indicates that inefficient dryland farmers could increase their production by concentrating on a circular economy strategy.

Surface water as a cause of land degradation from dryland salinity	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Secondary dryland salinity is a global land degradation issue. Drylands are often less developed, less well instrumented and less well understood, requiring us to adapt and impose understanding from different hydro-geomorphological settings that are better instrumented and understood. Conceptual models of secondary dryland salinity, from wet and more hydrologically connected landscapes imposed with adjustments for rainfall and streamflow, have led to the pervasive understanding that land clearing alters water balance in favour of increased infiltration and rising groundwater that bring salts to the surface. This paper presents data from an intra-catchment surface flow gauging network run for 6 years and a surface-water-groundwater (SW-GW) interaction site to assess the adequacy of our conceptual understanding of secondary dryland salinity in environments with low gradients and runoff yield. The aim is to (re-)conceptualise pathways of water and salt redistribution in dryland landscapes and to investigate the role that surface water flows and connectivity plays in land degradation from salinity in low-gradient drylands. Based on the long-term end-of-catchment gauge, average annual runoff yield is only 0.14% of rainfall. The internal gauging network that operated from 2007-2012 found pulses of internal water (also mobilising salt) in years when no flow was recorded at the catchment outlet. Data from a surface-water-groundwater interaction site show top-down recharge of surface water early in the water year that transitions to a bottom-up system of discharge later in the water year. This connection provides a mechanism for the vertical diffusion of salts to the surface waters, followed by evapo-concentration and downstream export when depression storage thresholds are exceeded. Intervention in this landscape by constructing a broad-based channel to address these processes resulted in a 25% increase in flow volume and a 20% reduction in salinity by allowing the lower catchment to more effectively support bypassing of the storages in the lower landscape that would otherwise retain water and allow salt to accumulate. Results from this study suggest catchment internal redistribution of relatively fresh runoff onto the valley floor is a major contributor to the development of secondary dryland salinity. Seasonally inundated areas are subject to significant transmission losses and drive processes of vertical salt mobility. These surface flow and connectivity processes are not only acting in isolation to cause secondary salinity but are also interacting with groundwater systems responding to land clearing and processes recognised in the more conventional understanding of hillslope recharge and groundwater discharge. The study landscape appears to have three functional hydrological components: upland, hillslope "flow" landscapes that generate fresh runoff; valley floor "fill" landscapes with high transmission losses and poor flow connectivity controlled by the micro-topography that promotes a surface-groundwater connection and salt movement; and the downstream "flood" landscapes, where flows are recorded only when internal storages (fill landscapes) are exceeded. This work highlights the role of surface water processes as a contributor to land degradation by dryland salinity in low-gradient landscapes.

Bentonite and humic acid (BHA) are increasingly being tested to remediate these degraded lands, with potential benefits on crop production and soil health. A field study was conducted to quantify the effects of BHA application at six rates (0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 Mg ha(-1)) on (i) dynamic changes in soil properties and (ii) oat crop productivity parameters in a dryland farming ecosystem. The specific objective of this paper was to determine the residual effects four to five years after a one-time BHA application on soil health and crop performance. The findings demonstrated that with the increasing rates of one-time BHA application, soil profile water storage displayed a piecewise linear plus plateau increase, whereas soil electrical conductivity, pH, and bulk density were all reduced significantly (p < 0.05) in the 0-20 cm and 20-60 cm layers. The improved soil environments gave rise to an increased activity of soil enzymes urease, invertase, and catalase that, respectively, reached peak values of 97%, 37%, and 32% of the control at the rates of 18 to 24 Mg BHA ha(-1). In turn, this boosted soil nutrient turnover, leading to a 40% higher soil available P. Compared with the control treatment, application of BHA at the estimated optimum rate (roughly 24 Mg ha(-1)) increased grain yield by 20%, protein yield by 62%, water use efficiency by 41%, and partial factor productivity of N by 20%. The results of this study indicated for the first time that a one-time BHA application would be a new and effective strategy to combat land degradation and drought, and promote a sustainable soil micro-ecological environment in dryland agroecosystems under a varying climate scenario.					liu, jinghui/IAP-8628-2023	Ma, Baoluo/0000-0002-8328-9481; Ma, Bin/0000-0003-3326-2317														2073-4395				APR	2022	12	4							853	10.3390/agronomy12040853	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12040853													WOS:000786224400001

Also, these disturbances affect plant community biodiversity and cover, which are also known to affect multiple ecosystem properties. However, the strength of the relative effects of the disturbance itself and of the effect that is mediated by changes in the plant community is still unclear. Questions We evaluated the relative direct and indirect effects (mediated by changes in the plant community) of the anthropogenic disturbances on ecosystem multifunctionality. Location Dry forests within the Sustainable Development Reserve Ponta do Tubarao, northeastern Brazil. Methods We measured standing biomass, litter mass, soil fertility and soil water content in 52 vegetation plots along a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance. Also, we measured woody plant cover and species' functional traits to characterize the plant community functional structure. We measured livestock grazing, selective logging and past clear-cuts as proxies of anthropogenic disturbance to create an index that characterizes the additive effect of these human activities. By building a theoretical model using the structural equation modelling approach, we investigated how the plant community changes in cover and biodiversity due to anthropogenic disturbances mediate changes in ecosystem properties. Results Our results show that anthropogenic disturbances had negative effects on ecosystem properties. Plant cover loss caused by anthropogenic disturbances was the major determinant of the negative effect of disturbances. The functional structure of the plant community had a weak effect on these properties. Conclusions By assessing the effect of human activities on multifunctionality, we found a stronger negative effect of anthropogenic disturbances when compared to its effect on single ecosystem properties. The recovery of plant cover should be a major focus of projects aiming to restore and maintain the multifunctionality of this dryland.

This is more conspicuous and seldom deleterious during droughts, which recur periodically. However, some of the crops sustain and recover their growth after the drought. Since desiccation of leaf is one of the consequences of depleting soil moisture and high temperature, we predicted that those crops that can maintain their photosynthetic efficiency during such stresses could outperform others. We hypothesised that the variation exists in the sensitivity of Photo system II (PS-II) component of the photosynthesis system among the dry land fruit crops. A series of experiments were conducted for assessing the desiccation responses of leaves of six fruit crops by employing chlorophyll fluorescence imaging, which reveals PS-II efficiency. As expected, there was a drastic reduction in the maximum quantum efficiency of PS-II (QYmax) of leaves of all the fruit crops with the decrease in tissue water content. However, there were significant differences among the crops in their responses to the desiccation of leaves. The PS-II tolerance to tissue dehydration observed in karonda (Carissa carandas L) and sweet orange (Citrus sinensis),was higher than that of mango (Mangifera indica L) and grape (Vitis vinifera L). This study reveals the method to assess the sensitivity of fruit crops to desiccation, which can be useful in water management, and in assessing the efficacy of novel chemicals for alleviating abiotic stresses.

Regional Scale Dryland Vegetation Classification with an Integrated Lidar-Hyperspectral Approach	REMOTE SENSING												The sparse canopy cover and large contribution of bright background soil, along with the heterogeneous vegetation types in close proximity, are common challenges for mapping dryland vegetation with remote sensing. Consequently, the results of a single classification algorithm or one type of sensor to characterize dryland vegetation typically show low accuracy and lack robustness. In our study, we improved classification accuracy in a semi-arid ecosystem based on the use of vegetation optical (hyperspectral) and structural (lidar) information combined with the environmental characteristics of the landscape. To accomplish this goal, we used both spectral angle mapper (SAM) and multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) for optical vegetation classification. Lidar-derived maximum vegetation height and delineated riparian zones were then used to modify the optical classification. Incorporating the lidar information into the classification scheme increased the overall accuracy from 60% to 89%. Canopy structure can have a strong influence on spectral variability and the lidar provided complementary information for SAM's sensitivity to shape but not magnitude of the spectra. Similar approaches to map large regions of drylands with low uncertainty may be readily implemented with unmixing algorithms applied to upcoming space-based imaging spectroscopy and lidar. This study advances our understanding of the nuances associated with mapping xeric and mesic regions, and highlights the importance of incorporating complementary algorithms and sensors to accurately characterize the heterogeneity of dryland ecosystems.

The two biophysical parameters vary nonlinearly during land change process with various time lags, which provide, as a whole, a useful framework to diagnose degree of land degradation and rehabilitation. In this study, the net primary productivity (NPP) and water use efficiency (WUE), which are the proxies of vegetation productivity and eco-physiological properties related to species composition, were combined to develop an eco-physiological framework to assess the degree of land degradation in the Northeast-Asia dryland regions (NADR) from 1982 to 2012. Results from long-term trends analysis showed early, middle or late degradation stages occurred in northern grassland and central barren or sparsely vegetated regions, respectively, while the rehabilitation prevailed in eastern croplands and forest, southern, and western grassland. In contrast, short-term trend analysis illustrated the recent rehabilitation in mid-eastern Mongolia and Loess Plateau, which was unseen in long-term trend analysis. The spatial patterns and temporal changes of land degradation and rehabilitation could be explained partly by either or both natural and anthropogenic factors. Long-term drying and warming might induce land degradation in northern and central NADR, respectively, while the recovery projects and wetting conditions after 2000s promoted the land rehabilitation in Loess Plateau and mid-eastern Mongolia. Here, our NPP-WUE framework may contribute further conceptual development and rapid assessments on land degradation and rehabilitation in wide geographic regions.

Changes in aquifer properties along a seasonal river channel of the Niger Basin: Identifying groundwater recharge pathways in a dryland environment	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												In drylands of tropical Africa, groundwater plays a fundamental role in alleviating food insecurity and adapting to the effects of climate change. Substantial uncertainty persists in the renewability of groundwater resources in drylands and recharge pathways through the surface geology. Here we characterize the architecture and hydrogeological properties of alluvium and underlying sandstone and crystalline basement rocks along the ephemeral River Goulbi de Maradi in the Iullemmeden Basin of Niger using Magnetic Resonance Soundings (MRS), Time-Domain Electromagnetic (TDEM) soundings, and borehole lithological data. Considerable varia-tions in lithological facies and hydrophysical properties are found along a series of 5 transects perpendicular to the seasonal/ephemeral river channel and adjacent plateaux of the Continental Hamadien (CH) sandstone. The CH aquifer comprises a pebbly sand facies upstream and sandstone clay facies downstream with Farak-type sandstones located at the base of the two facies. Consistent with these variations in facies, the geophysical pa-rameters decrease from 19%, 390 ms, and 800 omega m upstream to 3%, 160 ms, and 10 omega m downstream, respectively for effective porosity, relaxation time, and resistivity. The transmissivity and specific yield estimated from the decline of MRS longitudinally also vary from upstream to downstream. The combined use of surface geophysics constrained by lithological borehole logs provides vital insight into groundwater replenishment in this dryland environment.

However, N budgets of agroecosystems are still poorly quantified, presenting a barrier to understand the N turnover in agriculture. Agricultural ammonia (NH3) volatilization has been recognized as a crucial contribution to the pollution of fine particulate matters over China through reacting with acid gases. Building on these challenges, the first national-scale model analysis was constructed on the N budgets to gain an overall insight into the current status of N flows in Chinese dryland systems towards sustainable N management. Total inputs of soil N in Chinese dryland soils were estimated at 121 kg N ha(-1) in 2010, considering all pathways including N manure, fertilizer, atmospheric deposition and litter from crop residues. Atmospheric N deposition accounted for 25% of N fertilizer plus N manure in Chinese dryland soils, suggesting that N deposition could not be ignored when estimating total N inputs to Chinese dryland soils. The highest ratio of NH3 volatilization to total N outputs was found at 43 kg N ha(-1) (similar to 21%) in Northern China, followed by 41 kg N ha(-1) (similar to 20%) in Sichuan Basin and 25 kg N ha(-1) (similar to 26%) in Northeastern China. The modeling results indicated that, if a 20% decrease in N fertilizer plus N manure was achieved, it would lead to a 24% (7-49%) reduction in NH3 volatilization. Substantial reductions of NH 3 volatilization would also be achieved by making an improvement in changing management practices (controlled release fertilizer and full irrigation). The results would give an overall insight into N budgets in Chinese dryland soils. The constructed N budgets assisted with understanding agricultural N flows and NH3 pollution, and evaluated the impacts of human activities on N cycle towards a precise way to regulate agricultural management.

Contrasting mechanisms underlie short- and longer-term soil respiration responses to experimental warming in a dryland ecosystem	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Soil carbon losses to the atmosphere through soil respiration are expected to rise with ongoing temperature increases, but available evidence from mesic biomes suggests that such response disappears after a few years of experimental warming. However, there is lack of empirical basis for these temporal dynamics in soil respiration responses, and for the mechanisms underlying them, in drylands, which collectively form the largest biome on Earth and store 32% of the global soil organic carbon pool. We coupled data from a 10 year warming experiment in a biocrust-dominated dryland ecosystem with laboratory incubations to confront 0-2 years (short-term hereafter) versus 8-10 years (longer-term hereafter) soil respiration responses to warming. Our results showed that increased soil respiration rates with short-term warming observed in areas with high biocrust cover returned to control levels in the longer-term. Warming-induced increases in soil temperature were the main drivers of the short-term soil respiration responses, whereas longer-term soil respiration responses to warming were primarily driven by thermal acclimation and warming-induced reductions in biocrust cover. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating short- and longer-term soil respiration responses to warming as a mean to reduce the uncertainty in predicting the soil carbon-climate feedback in drylands.

Biophysical effects on soil crack morphology in a faunally active dryland vertisol	GEODERMA												Faunal behavior in dryland ecosystems may physically influence swelling soil hydrologic and pedologic processes due to its contributions to soil crack formation. In order to provide a physical link between this faunal activity and pedological processes, we use a resin visualization technique and X-ray imaging to characterize the biomechanical influences of biocompaction (mega/meso-herbivores) and bioturbation (termites) on 3D crack morphology and topology in a faunally active dryland vertisol system. Results show increased soil cracking intensity due to faunal influence. However, this increased cracking diverged by faunal influence: bioturbation creates "surficial" (shallow, extensive) crack networks while biocompaction creates "systematic" (deep, narrow) crack networks, compared to a reference soil. Biocompacted soils also exhibit a memory of past wetting and drying events via vertically layered crack morphologies. Despite differences in these crack magnitudes between the faunal influences, crack structures show morphological and topological similarity as a topological network. These persistent differences in field crack systems may potentially create convectively-driven "hotspots" of enhanced water and carbon gas transport in dryland ecosystems as a result of crack formation, highlighting the importance of considering fracture behavior in both an ecological, atmospheric, and pedologic context.

However, there is limited understanding of mismatches between supply and demand of ecosystem services (ESs), which has serious implications for both human wellbeing and environmental sustainability, particularly in drylands. This paper provides three perspectives: (1) an understanding of ESs in dryland catchments from a systemic process perspective; (2) an understanding of ESs in dryland catchments from a spatial management perspective; and (3) an understanding of mismatches between ecosystem service supply (ESS) and ecosystem service demand (ESD) from a long timeframe perspective. We then propose a driver-based framework for managing the mismatches between ESS and ESD. It is expected that applying these perspectives and the framework in an integrated way can assist in addressing ES mismatches to achieve ecological security and sustainable development of the socio-economy in drylands.

Long-term effects of dryland and irrigation production systems on soil Fusarium communities in wheat	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY												Characterization and quantification of Fusarium communities and other microorganisms are crucial for understanding Fusarium ecology and management of root diseases of wheat. Fusarium communities in soils and on wheat roots from 12 Nebraska farms under dryland, and irrigated production systems were investigated using dilution plating assays, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and subsequent DNA sequence analysis. Results showed that the population densities of Fusarium in soils were significantly higher under dryland than irrigated production systems, and Pythium, Trichoderma, and Pseudomonas spp. in soils and on wheat roots were significantly lower in dryland systems. However, colonization of Fusarium spp. on the root surface, Shannon diversity indices and richness of Fusarium spp. in soils were generally higher in soils under dryland than irrigation systems based on the soils from 12 farms. Also, Shannon diversity indices and richness of Fusarium spp. in soils were significantly higher in soils under non-irrigated compared to adjacent irrigated centre-pivot field. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that soil Fusarium communities generally formed two groups with overlap based on dryland and irrigation systems with 12 farm samplings, whereas the Fusarium communities formed two distinct groups in soils under irrigated and non-irrigated section of the centre pivot field. Moreover, dryland and irrigation systems affected several soil chemical properties. In general, soils under long-term irrigation tend to reduce populations and diversities of Fusarium spp. and increase populations and diversities of Pythium spp. compared with dryland systems.

Resilience to drought of dryland wetlands threatened by climate change	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Dryland wetlands are resilient ecosystems that can adapt to extreme periodic drought-flood episodes. Climate change projections show increased drought severity in drylands that could compromise wetland resilience and reduce important habitat services. These recognized risks have been difficult to evaluate due to our limited capacity to establish comprehensive relationships between flood-drought episodes and vegetation responses at the relevant spatiotemporal scales. We address this issue by integrating detailed spatiotemporal flood-drought simulations with remotely sensed vegetation responses to water regimes in a dryland wetland known for its highly variable inundation. We show that a combination of drought tolerance and dormancy strategies allow wetland vegetation to recover after droughts and recolonize areas invaded by terrestrial species. However, climate change scenarios show widespread degradation during drought and limited recovery after floods. Importantly, the combination of degradation extent and increase in drought duration is critical for the habitat services wetland systems provide for waterbirds and fish.

J	Núñez, A; Schipanski, M				Nunez, Agustin; Schipanski, Meagan			Changes in soil organic matter after conversion from irrigated to dryland cropping systems	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Global water resources are under increasing pressure, and some regions face the need to retire irrigation due to groundwater depletion or to meet governmental regulations. In arid and semiarid climates, irrigated lands tend to have more soil organic carbon (SOC) than non-irrigated croplands. However, little is known about how SOC might change following irrigation retirement. Our objective was to quantify changes in SOC and nitrogen stocks after irrigation retirement in semiarid agroecosystems of the High Plains. We sampled fields that stopped using irrigation and transitioned into either dryland crops or ungrazed perennial grasslands and compared SOC and nitrogen stocks in these fields with still irrigated and long-term dryland situations. Currently irrigated fields had more SOC (83.0 vs 73.3 Mg ha-1) and nitrogen (10.2 vs 9.4 Mg ha-1) at 0-80 cm depth than their dryland counterparts, confirming the reported positive impact of irrigation in semiarid agroecosystems. However, there was no legacy effect of irrigation on SOC and nitrogen topsoil stocks 7-10 years after transition to dryland crops as retired fields had lower stocks than still irrigated fields and did not differ from long-term dryland cropping zones of the same fields. This lack of a legacy effect was related to the preferential accumulation, during irrigation, of carbon and nitrogen in the less stable particulate organic matter pool at 0-10 cm soil depth. The transition from irrigated agriculture to perennial grasses resulted in intermediate SOC stocks, that did not differ from the still irrigated nor from the sites retired to dryland crops. Our results suggest that perennial systems are a viable option to mitigate, at least partially, the negative impact of irrigation retirement on SOC. However, the advantage of perennial grasses was explained by the accumulation of carbon and nitrogen in the particulate organic matter fraction, which poses some questions about the stability of SOC in these systems after changes in management.

Understanding the relationships between forest structure and function is essential for managing dryland forests to adapt to these changes. We investigated the structure-function relationships in four dryland conifer forests distributed along a semiarid to subhumid climatic aridity gradient. Forest structure was represented by leaf area index (LAI) and function by gross primary productivity (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET), and the derived efficiencies of water use (WUE = GPP/ET) and leaf area (LAE = GPP/LAI). Estimates of GPP and ET were based on the observed relationships between high-resolution vegetation indices from VEN mu S and Sentinel-2A satellites and flux data from three eddy covariance towers in the study regions between November 2015 to October 2018. The red-edge-based MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) from VEN mu S and Sentinel-2A showed strong correlations to flux tower GPP and ET measurements for the three sites (R-cal (2)> 0.91, R-val(2) > 0.84). Using our approach, we showed that as LAI decreased with decreasing aridity index (AI) (i.e., dryer conditions), estimated GPP and ET decreased (R-2 > 0.8 to LAI), while WUE (R-2 = 0.68 to LAI) and LAE increased. The observed global-scale patterns are associated with a variety of forest vegetation characteristics, at the local scale, such as tree species composition and density. However, our results point towards a canopy-level mechanism, where the ecosystem-LAI and resultant proportion of sun-exposed vs. shaded leaves are primary determinants of WUE and LAE along the studied climatic aridity gradient. This work demonstrates the importance of high-resolution (spatially and spectrally) remote sensing data conjugated with flux tower data for monitoring dryland forests and understanding the intricate structure-function interactions in their response to drying conditions.

Species interactions across trophic levels mediate rainfall effects on dryland vegetation dynamics	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Arid ecosystems are strongly limited by water availability, and precipitation plays a major role in the dynamics of all species in arid regions, as well as the ecosystem processes that occur there. However, understanding how biotic interactions mediate long-term responses of dryland ecosystems to rainfall remains very fragmented. We report on a unique large-scale field experiment spanning 25 yr and three trophic levels (plants, small mammal herbivores, predators) in a dryland ecosystem in the northern Chilean Mediterranean Region where we assessed how biotic interactions influence the long-term plant community responses to precipitation. As the most persistent ecological changes in dryland systems may result from changes in the structure, cover, and composition of the perennial vegetation, we emphasized the interplay between bottom-up and top-down controls of perennial plants in our analyses. Rainfall was the primary factor affecting the dynamics of, and interactions among, plants and small mammals. Ephemeral plant cover dynamics closely tracked short-term annual rainfall, but seemed unaffected by top-down controls (herbivory). In contrast, the response of the perennial plant cover to precipitation was mediated by (1) a complex interplay between subtle top-down (herbivory) controls that become more apparent in the long-term, (2) competition with ephemeral plants during wet years, and (3) an indirect effect of predators on subdominant shrubs and perennial herbs. This long-term field experiment highlights how climate-induced responses of arid perennial vegetation are influenced by interactions across trophic levels and temporal scales. In the face of global change, understanding how multi-trophic controls mediate dryland vegetation responses to climate is essential to properly managing the conservation of biodiversity in arid systems.

However, the influence of DRNF on duck production and immune performance remains poorly understood. In this study, 2,280 Shaoxing ducks, an egg-type breed of Sheldrake in China, were chosen and randomly divided into 2 groups to investigate the effects of DRNF on duck farming. During the experimental laying rates, feed-egg ratios, and mortality rates of the 2 groups were calculated and recorded. Serum immune parameters, including thymus index, spleen index, levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), were determined. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was used to analyze the variability of gut microbiota in the duck ileum and cecum. The results showed that DRNF significantly reduced the mortality rate of the ducks and increased the thymus index (P < 0.05), compared to the control. No other significant differences were detected in productional and immune indices (P > 0.05). The 16S rRNA sequencing results revealed differentially enriched microbial compositions in the ileum and cecum, which might be responsible for the improved immune function of Shaoxing ducks. For example, an increase in Lactobacillaceae (family), Anaerotruncus (genus), Saccharibacteria (phylum), Flavobacteriaceae (family), and a reduction in Anaerobiospirillum (genus), Lachnospiraceae (family), Blautia (genus) was revealed in the DRNF ducks. In conclusion, DRNF could alter gut microflora, enhance duck immune system, and reduce mortality in Shaoxing ducks.																			0032-5791	1525-3171				OCT	2019	98	10					4530	4538		10.3382/ps/pez268	http://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pez268								31111923					WOS:000491241800039

Barley, as the main cereal is predominantly cultivated in dryland and the livelihood of smallholders depends on the production of this crop, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. This study aimed to investigate the response of the grain yield of dryland barley to temperature and precipitation variations at annual, seasonal and monthly scales in seven counties of East and West Azerbaijan provinces in northwestern Iran during 1991-2010. Humidity index (HI) was calculated and its relationship with dryland barley yield was evaluated at annual and monthly scales. The results showed that the minimum, maximum and mean temperatures increased by 0.19 degrees C/a, 0.11 degrees C/a and 0.10 degrees C/a, respectively, while annual precipitation decreased by 0.80 mm/a during 1991-2010. Climate in study area has become drier by 0.22/a in annual HI during the study period. Negative effects of increasing temperature on the grain yield of dryland barley were more severe than the positive effects of increasing precipitation. Besides, weather variations in April and May were related more to the grain yield of dryland barley than those in other months. The grain yield of dryland barley was more drastically affected by the variation of annual minimum temperature comparing with other weather variables. Furthermore, our findings illustrated that the grain yield of dryland barley increased by 0.01 t/hm(2) for each unit increase in annual HI during 1991-2010. Finally, any increase in the monthly HI led to crop yield improvement in the study area, particularly in the drier counties, i.e., Myaneh, Tabriz and Khoy in Iran.

Although dryland expansion has been widely investigated in previous studies, there is a lack of quantitative evidence supporting human-induced changes in dryland extent. Here, using multiple observational datasets and model simulations from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, we employ both correlation-based and optimal fingerprinting approaches to conduct quantitative detection and attribution of dryland expansion. Our results show that spatial changes in atmospheric aridity (i.e., the aridity index defined by the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration) between the recent period 1990-2014 and the past period 1950-74 are unlikely to have been caused by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, it is very likely (at least 95% confidence level) that dryland expansion at the global scale was driven principally by GHG emissions. Over the period 1950-2014, global drylands expanded by 3.67% according to observations, and the dryland expansion attributed to GHG emissions is estimated as similar to 4.5%. Drylands are projected to continue expanding, and their populations to increase until global warming reaches similar to 3.5 degrees C above preindustrial temperature under the middle- and high-emission scenarios. If warming exceeds similar to 3.5 degrees C, a reduction in population density would drive a decrease in dryland population. Our results for the first time provide quantitative evidence for the dominant effects of GHG emissions on global dryland expansion, which is helpful for anthropogenic climate change adaptation in drylands. Significance StatementIn the past decades, global drylands have been reported to show changes in space and time, based on atmospheric aridity (i.e., aridity index defined by the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration). Using two detection and attribution methods, the spatial change patterns of atmospheric aridity between 1990-2014 and 1950-74 are unlikely to be driven by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, whereas the temporal expansion of global drylands (i.e., 3.67% from 1950 to 2014) is principally attributed to GHG emissions (contribution: similar to 122%). Quantitative evidence from the detection and attribution analysis supports the dominant role of greenhouse gas emissions in global dryland expansion, which will increase the population suffering from water shortages under future warming unless climate adaptation is adopted.

Various agricultural policies and programs cannot be achieved without considering the sustainability of farm management. This article aims to analyze the sustainability of the management of dryland farming in food-insecure areas and the strategies to increase its sustainability. The study took a sample of the area on three large islands in the Province of East Nusa Tenggara (ENT), Indonesia. The samples of 240 farmers were taken by snowball sampling. Data were analyzed using the Multi Dimensional Scale (MDS) method. In this method, an ordination technique called Rapid Appraisal for Dryland Farming Management (RAP-DAFARM) was applied. The results of the study show that multidimensional management of dryland farming is less sustainable. To improve the sustain ability status of dryland farming management in the future, some strategies are implemented, including increasing the role of capital supporting institutions, grouped-farming management patterns, agricultural insurance programs, agricultural livestock waste utilization, and others.

In recent decades, interest in using organic fertilizers as sustainable agricultural has been increased. Cultivation of saffron under dryland farming, in addition to the production of this valuable spice, could prevent erosion, especially in slops. This experiment evaluated the effect of organic and inorganic fertilizers on active ingredients (safranal, crocin, picrocrocin), macronutrients (NPK), and stomatal properties of saffron (C. sativus L.) in a research station (Hamand) near Tehran. The plants were treated with cattle manure (20 t/ha-1) and foliar application of Delfard (7 kg/ha/) and Floral P (2.5 kg/ha) in a completely randomized block design (CRBD) with three replications in 2015-16. The results of liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed decreasing in safranal content (0.04-0.11 mu g/g) organic and inorganic fertilizers, whereas the fertilizers enhanced crocin (85-146 mu g/g) and picrocrocin (3.5-10.5 mu g/g) concentrations. Although there were no significant differences between the N concentration of floral and control. Organic and delfard-treated plants showed higher N compared to control. A significant increase of leaf P concentration was obtained in plants treated with inorganic realizers, where floral and delfard resulted in 3.5 and 2.2-fold improvement of P content compared to control, respectively. Delfard had a significant effect in the enhancement of K. The stomatal size remained unchanged, Although their density decreased over fertilizer application. According to the results, it could be concluded that manure, delfard and floral fertilizers can improve the nutritional value of saffron such as crocin and picrocrocin concentrations under dry farming conditions.

The present study aimed to develop a physical profile and evaluate the relationship between dryland strength-power and stroke kinematic variables in elite breaststroke swimmers. Methods: A series of range-of-motion, dryland strength-power, and anthropometric measures were assessed in 11 elite-level breaststroke specialists and used to establish group-based averages and expected variance within an elite breaststroke population. Results: Analysis of the relationships between dryland strength-power parameters and breaststroke kinematics revealed strong associations (r >.7, minimum 95% confidence range of g > 0.80 or < -0.80) most frequently at 100-m and maximal paces. From further analysis of these associations, a series of second-order models of best fit were calculated to describe the relationship between dryland strength-power parameters and propulsive velocity. Five models strongly described the relationship between countermovement jump height, mean pull-up velocity, and average propulsive velocity. Conclusions: These models can be used to assess propulsion effectiveness and act as a catalyst for technique evaluation. It is also recommended that strength and conditioning coaches consider the inclusion of explosive movements, such as countermovement jumps and maximal velocity pull-ups, in dryland training programs designed for sprint breaststroke swimmers.

J	Throop, HL; Belnap, J				Throop, Heather L.; Belnap, Jayne			Connectivity Dynamics in Dryland Litter Cycles: Moving Decomposition beyond Spatial Stasis	BIOSCIENCE												Drylands (arid and semiarid ecosystems) cover nearly half of Earth's terrestrial surface, but biogeochemical pools and processes in these systems remain poorly understood. Litter can account for a substantial portion of carbon and nutrient pools in these systems, with litter decomposition exerting important controls over biogeochemical cycling. Dryland decomposition is typically treated as a spatially static process in which litter is retained and decomposed where it is initially deposited. Although this assumption is reasonable for mesic systems with continuous plant canopy cover and a stable subcanopy litter layer, dryland pools generally reflect discontinuous inputs from heterogeneous canopy cover followed by substantial litter transport. In the present article, we review horizontal and vertical transport processes that move litter from the initial deposition point and retention elements that influence litter accumulation patterns. Appreciation of the spatially dynamic litter cycle, including quantitative assessment of transport patterns, will improve estimates of the fate and distribution of organic matter in current and future drylands.

Forecasting dryland vegetation condition months in advance through satellite data assimilation	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Dryland ecosystems are characterised by rainfall variability and strong vegetation response to changes in water availability over a range of timescales. Forecasting dryland vegetation condition can be of great value in planning agricultural decisions, drought relief, land management and fire preparedness. At monthly to seasonal time scales, knowledge of water stored in the system contributes more to predictability than knowledge of the climate system state. However, realising forecast skill requires knowledge of the vertical distribution of moisture below the surface and the capacity of the vegetation to access this moisture. Here, we demonstrate that contrasting satellite observations of water presence over different vertical domains can be assimilated into an eco-hydrological model and combined with vegetation observations to infer an apparent vegetation-accessible water storage (hereafter called accessible storage). Provided this variable is considered explicitly, skilful forecasts of vegetation condition are achievable several months in advance for most of the world's drylands.

Spaceborne Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) provide potential for assessing subtle topographic and hydrodynamic changes in these low-gradient, low-relief settings, but challenges are posed by limitations in vertical and horizontal accuracy. This study evaluates the use of different spaceborne DEMs for topographic characterisation and flood flow modelling of the low-gradient ( < 0.0006 m m(-1)) Rio Colorado terminal system, Bolivia. A comparison between DEM and field dGPS elevation data (1290 measurement points) reveals that the TanDEM-X DEM 12 m (TDX-12 m) has a RMSE of 0.47 m, far less than those of other frequently used spacebome DEMs such as ALOS RTC (4.58 m) and SRTM (6.02 m). For hydrodynamic modelling, TDX-12 m data were smoothed (adaptive filter and feature-preserving DEM smoothing) and upscaled. The smoothed TDX-12 m data were mosaiced with a dGPS data-derived river path, surveyed along a reach (mean width < 30 m) with a prominent downstream size decrease. The methods enabled effective de-noising of the TDX-12 m data (RMSE 0.29 m) and resulted in a high linear regression correlation coefficient (0.75). HEC-RAS 2D modelling reveals that in the selected reach, overbank flooding starts in the downstream part when discharge is < 18 m(3)/s, with flow initially spreading through crevasse channels and levee topographic lows. As discharge increases, flow spreads farther across the floodplain, ultimately forming connected floodplain flow in distal topographic lows. Satellite imagery and a derived water index indicate the same floodplain flow patterns as the modelling (critical success index 0.77). Wider use of DEMs based on TDX-12 m data for topographic characterization and flood flow modelling along relatively small, low-gradient terminal dryland rivers will result in many scientific and applied benefits.

One example of such land consolidation is dryland-to-paddy conversion. The conversion of land use pattern largely affects the stability of farmland soil, especially the soil carbon cycle. However, the mutual feedback mechanisms between carbon flux variation and environmental factors during the farmland consolidation process are still poorly known. Located in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain China, Xuzhou is a typical area where dryland-to-paddy conversion are most widely distributed. Therefore, in this study, we have carried out drylandto-paddy conversion by setting up two isolated rectangular fields one group planting corn in dryland (DL) and another group planting in paddy field (PF) in Xuzhou. Here, we determined the effect of dryland-to-paddy consolidation on soil CO2 flux in two isolated rectangular fields - the dryland (DL) cultivated with corn and the paddy field (PF) cultivated with rice. Our results showed that the soil carbon flux and temperature followed similar unimodal curves with greater soil CO2 flux of in PF than in DL. Surprisingly, the land conversion significantly reduced soil microbial biomass carbon and easily oxidized organic carbon by 28.55% and 29.09%, respectively. The structural equation modeling results demonstrated that the changes in soil environmental factors, including temperature, and fungal OTU numbers, were the primary drivers for the soil CO2 flux and soil carbon pool (P < 0.05). Overall, this study improves the understanding of the ecological impact of dryland-topaddy conversion, providing insights into low-carbon agriculture and climate mitigation.

However, it is difficult to directly map woody vegetation and herbaceous vegetation in the dryland from the satellite images due to the mixture of their distribution at small scale. Emerging UAV remote sensing provides a good opportunity to capture and quantify the distribution of the sparse vegetation in the drylands ecosystem. In this study, we proposed a new method to classify woody vegetation and herbaceous vegetation and calculate their FVC based on the high-resolution orthomosaic generated from UAV images by the machine learning algorithm of classification and regression tree (CART). This proposed method was validated and evaluated by visual interpretation, the detailed ground measurement dataset of 4832 trees and 18,798 shrubs and three popular machine learning algorithms of Support Vector Machine(SVM), Random Forest(RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree(GBDT). The overall assessments showed good overall accuracy (0.78), average accuracy (0.76), and the Kappa coefficient (0.64). The FVC of woody vegetation calculated from orthomosaic agreed well with that estimated from ground measurements. Both group of FVC have a stable linear relationship over different spatial scales. The proposed method showed higher efficiency of 166%, 111% and 290% than SVM, RF, GBDT respectively. A new optimized model was developed to reduce the workload of vegetation investigation and to design more efficient sampling strategies. The proposed method was incorporated into an interactive web-based software "UAV-High Resolution imagery Analysis Platform" (UAV-HiRAP, http://www.uav-hirap.org). Our study demonstrates that UAV-HiRAP combined with UAV platform can be a powerful tool to classify woody vegetation and herbaceous vegetation and calculate their FVC for sparse vegetation in the drylands. The new optimization model will inspire researchers to design more effective sampling strategies for future field investigation.

J	Liu, SS; Lang, XM; Jiang, DB				Liu, Shanshan; Lang, Xianmei; Jiang, Dabang			Time-varying responses of dryland aridity to external forcings over the last 21 ka	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Identifying potential external forcings on dryland aridity at various timescales and clarifying underlying mechanisms can advance our knowledge of dryland climate behaviors. To address this issue, we examine the past 21 ka using a set of transient simulations driven by realistic climatic forcings, as well as multiple types of proxies. The simulations suggest the evolution of dryland aridity and dominant forcings vary over time and region. On average, global drylands feature two-phase aridification at the orbital scale: the first phase occurs before the Holocene and is dominated by ice sheet melting and rising greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, followed by the second phase driven by the summer insolation decrease over northern high latitudes after the early Holocene; different from the wetness during the orbital-scale glacial period, millennium-scale cold events forced by meltwater discharges correspond to desiccation, punctuating the long-term trend during the last deglaciation. In addition, the average aridity changes for drylands are larger than those for global landmasses under all forcings except GHG concentrations. Spatially, the dominant external forcings and aridity responses to the same forcing vary regionally, mainly related to the latitude and hemisphere. Further diagnosis indicates the manners to affect aridity, namely through altering precipitation or evaporative capacity, vary by forcing. The aforementioned evolution of the simulated aridity matches well with the proxies in most dryland zones. This study provides a scenario of time-varying responses of dryland aridity to external forcings over the last 21 ka and may shed light on the future changes. 0 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessing the climatically triggered aggradation-incision processes in a dryland environment during the Late Quaternary period from Shetrunji River basin (Saurashtra), India	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The present study is an attempt to infer the response of the dryland fluvial sequences to paleoenvironmental change since the last glacial maximum (LGM) from the semi-arid Saurashtra region, a basaltic terrain of the Late Cretaceous age (Deccan Trap), of Western India. We employed a conventional sedimentological analysis supported by sediment geochemistry, which was constrained by optical dating. Based on detailed field investigation, we identified five terrace sequences from the valley fill deposit in the Shetrunji River basin since 18 ka (i.e. Post LGM). The sedimentary archives expose the deposition during three alternate phases of aggradation and incision, marked on the basis of morphostratigraphy and timing of landform evolution. The coastal region of western India experienced a widespread valley aggradation in response to the rising sea stand and under gradual strengthening of the monsoonal conditions around the 18?9 ka period. The Early Holocene climatic optima (9-7.5 ka) coupled with lower than present but rising sea stand, triggered the intense erosion in the valleys of Shetrunji River basin, leading to erosion/lack of sediment preservation. This was followed by the Middle Holocene period (7.5-5 ka), which experienced valley aggradation. This was ended by the incision post 5.5 ka in the lower reaches of the Shetrunji River. The sea stand was similar to present-day stand, as evidenced by the change from fluvial to the estuarine environment in the top sequence of Site-SL at 5.5 ka. The Late Holocene relative sea stand lowering similar to 3 ka, led to an incision in the estuarine terrace of about 2 m. The causal mechanism for triggering of this incision is most likely the relative fall in sea stand to present-day level from its Middle Holocene high stand. The Late Holocene period (3-1 ka) shows aggradation in upper reach in fluctuating hydrodynamic conditions with seasonality, followed by a relatively good monsoonal condition at < 1 ka, leading to the incision due to climatetectonic interplay. These pulses of sedimentation could be recognized and explored as aided by basin-scale approach as in the present study. Site-specific studies do not enjoy such liberty.																			1040-6182	1873-4553				MAY 30	2021	585						70	84		10.1016/j.quaint.2020.07.007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2020.07.007		APR 2021											WOS:000640138500003

Choosing effective strategies is especially important for earthen heritage sites located in dryland regions, as many are experiencing rapid environmentally-driven deterioration. We use a newly developed cellular automaton model (ViSTA-HD), to evaluate the environmental deterioration risk, over a 100-year period, under a range of potential climate and conservation scenarios. Results show increased wind velocities could substantially increase the overall deterioration risk, implying the need for wind-reducing conservation strategies. In contrast, predicted increases in rainfall are not likely to increase the overall deterioration risk, despite greater risk of rain-driven deterioration features. Of the four conservation strategies tested in our model, deterioration risk under all climatic scenarios was best reduced by increasing the coverage of natural, randomly-distributed vegetation to 80%. We suggest this approach could be an appropriate long-term conservation strategy for other earthen sites in dryland regions.																			2045-2322					OCT 2	2020	10	1							16419	10.1038/s41598-020-73456-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-73456-8								33009440					WOS:000577151500014

In this study we present a new easily applicable methodology for the ecohydrological characterization of dryland ecosystem functioning grounded in the balance between these two strongly interrelated processes using easily obtainable remote sensing data (e.g. UAV and SENTINEL-2 images), the BalanCR method (Balance between Connectivity and potential Water Retention Capacity). This methodology was first tested on synthetic hillslopes representing different configurations of the patchy and heterogenic distribution of vegetation in drylands. The analysis of these synthetic vegetation spatial patterns involving different vegetation patch densities, sizes, and fractional coverage values showed that BalanCR properly characterizes the expected ecohydrological interactions between potential conditions of runoff connectivity and water retention by plants operating in drylands. In a second step, we applied the BalanCR method on four semiarid hillslopes along an altitudinal aridity gradient covered by Mediterranean alpha steppes at very detailed spatial resolution (0.2 m) and at medium resolution (10 m). The obtained results were validated based on soil moisture data and vegetation greening and clearly recognized the four study sites as functional ecosystems, with very low water resource losses, and a pattern of increasing water redistribution processes as vegetation coverage declines. However, the sensitivity of methodology depends on the resolution of the input data (vegetation map and Digital Elevation Model; DEM), and the expected positive effect of small vegetation structures (vegetation patches smaller than the pixel size) on water redistribution is underestimated. Even in this case, the functionality and connectivity of the analyzed sites is correctly characterized as ecosystems showed similar values of both components for the methodology BalanC (hydrological connectivity component) and BalanR (potential water retention capacity component) than those obtained at very detailed scale, with a similar pattern of water allocation values in response to increased aridity. Thus, the proposed metric represents a promising tool for the proper evaluation of dryland conditions and to incorporate hillslope processes in climate change models, which is one of the main gaps to better understand the drylands response upon ongoing climate change.

J	Li, JG; Tooth, S; Yao, GQ				Li, Jiaguang; Tooth, Stephen; Yao, Guangqing			Cascades of sub-decadal, channel-floodplain changes in low-gradient, non-vegetated reaches near a dryland river terminus: Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												The terminus of the ephemeral Rio Colorado is located at the margins of Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia, the world's largest salt lake. The low-gradient (<0.0006mm(-1)), non-vegetated reaches approaching the terminus provide an excellent natural laboratory for investigating cascades of channel-floodplain changes that occur in response to quasi-regular flows (at least once annually) and fine-grained sediment supply (dominantly silt and clay). High-resolution satellite imagery (<0.65m, various dates from 2004 onwards) and field data reveal widespread, pronounced and rapid morphodynamics on sub-decadal timescales, including channel erosion and chute cutoff formation, and development of crevasse channels and splays, floodouts (unchannelled surfaces at channel termini), and erosion cells (floodplain scour-transport-fill features). In particular, following high annual precipitation (>400mm) in 2004-2005 and two subsequent high magnitude daily precipitation events (similar to 40mm), all of which led to widespread flooding, numerous crevasse splays formed between 2004 and 2016, avulsions occurred at nearby floodouts, and erosion cells downstream of the splays and floodouts underwent striking morphological changes. High-precision GPS data reveal two preferential localities for erosion cell development: partially or fully abandoned channels with crevasse splay remnants, and topographic lows between channels. In this overall low-gradient setting, comparatively high gradients (up to similar to 0.0006mm(-1)) at the edge of splay deposits and topography created by crevasses and abandoned channels may initiate knickpoint retreat and thereafter erosion cell development. Abandoned channels with splays tend to give rise to narrow, deep erosion cells, while topographic lows promote relatively shallow, wide erosion cells. In both situations, erosion cells may extend upslope and downslope, and eventually connect to form straight channels. The channel-floodplain morphodynamics near the Rio Colorado terminus extend previous analyses of low-gradient, dryland river systems, particularly because the lack of vegetation and quasi-regular floods drive cascades of rapid changes on sub-decadal timescales.

Impact of climate change on greenhouse gas emissions and water balance in a dryland-cropping region with variable precipitation	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Wheat covers a significant fraction of the US Pacific Northwest (PNW) dryland agriculture. Past studies have suggested that management practices can differentially affect productivity and emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) across the different agro-ecological Zones (AEZs) in PNW. In this study we used CropSyst, a biophysically-based cropping systems model that simulates crop processes and water and nitrogen cycles, with the purpose of evaluating relevant scenarios and contributing analyses to inform adaptation and mitigation strategies aimed at reducing and managing the risks of climate change. We compared the baseline historical period of 1980?2010 with three future periods: 2015?2045 (2030s), 2035?2065 (2050s), and 2055?2085 (2070s). The uncertainty of the future climate was captured using 12 general circulation models (GCMs) forced with two representative carbon dioxide concentration pathways (RCP 4.5 and 8.5). The study region was divided into three AEZs: crop-fallow (CF), continuous cropping to fallow transition (CCF), and continuous cropping (CC). The results indicated that areas with higher precipitation, N fertilization, and mineralization produced more N2O emissions during both baseline and future periods. The average annual N2O emission during the baseline period was between 1.8 and 4.1 kg ha- 1 depending on AEZ. The overall N2O emission showed decreasing future trends from 2030s to 2070s which resulted from a higher proportion of N used by crops. From 2015 to 2085 under RCP 4.5, the average N2O emission was between 1.8 and 4.4 kg ha- 1 year- 1. They are slightly higher under RCP 8.5 since it is a warmer scenario. The soil organic carbon (SOC) content decreased during the baseline period while SOC did not reach equilibrium with the cropping systems considered in the study. SOC decreased during the future periods as well, with rate of change ranging from -146 to -352 kg ha- 1year- 1 depending on AEZ and RCP. Warming increased SOC oxidation in future scenarios, but after an initial increase of SOC losses during the 2030s period, the rate of SOC losses decreased in the 2050s, and more so in the 2070s as SOC and carbon input reached equilibrium with losses. Higher carbon input resulted from higher biomass production under elevated CO2 scenarios. The total GHG emissions were 1.95, 3.16 and 4.84 Mg CO2-equivalent ha- 1year- 1 under RCP 4.5, and 1.99, 3.43 and 5.49 Mg CO2-equivalent ha- 1year- 1 under RCP 8.5 during 2070s in CF, CCF and CC respectively, with N2O accounting for about 81% of total GHG emissions.

DRYP 1.0: a parsimonious hydrological model of DRYland Partitioning of the water balance	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												Dryland regions are characterised by water scarcity and are facing major challenges under climate change. One difficulty is anticipating how rainfall will be partitioned into evaporative losses, groundwater, soil moisture, and runoff (the water balance) in the future, which has important implications for water resources and dryland ecosystems. However, in order to effectively estimate the water balance, hydrological models in drylands need to capture the key processes at the appropriate spatio-temporal scales. These include spatially restricted and temporally brief rainfall, high evaporation rates, transmission losses, and focused groundwater recharge. Lack of available input and evaluation data and the high computational costs of explicit representation of ephemeral surface-groundwater interactions restrict the usefulness of most hydrological models in these environments. Therefore, here we have developed a parsimonious distributed hydrological model for DRYland Partitioning (DRYP). The DRYP model incorporates the key processes of water partitioning in dryland regions with limited data requirements, and we tested it in the data-rich Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed against measurements of streamflow, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration. Overall, DRYP showed skill in quantifying the main components of the dryland water balance including monthly observations of streamflow (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, NSE, similar to 0.7), evapotranspiration (NSE > 0.6), and soil moisture (NSE similar to 0.7). The model showed that evapotranspiration consumes > 90% of the total precipitation input to the catchment and that < 1% leaves the catchment as streamflow. Greater than 90% of the overland flow generated in the catchment is lost through ephemeral channels as transmission losses. However, only similar to 35% of the total transmission losses percolate to the groundwater aquifer as focused groundwater recharge, whereas the rest is lost to the atmosphere as riparian evapotranspiration. Overall, DRYP is a modular, versatile, and parsimonious Python-based model which can be used to anticipate and plan for climatic and anthropogenic changes to water fluxes and storage in dryland regions.

Effects of Dryland Training During the COVID-19 Lockdown Period on Swimming Performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORTS PHYSIOLOGY AND PERFORMANCE												Purpose: To examine the effect of dryland training during an 11-week lockdown period due to COVID-19 on swimming performance. Methods: Twelve competitive swimmers performed 50- and 300-m maximum-effort tests in their preferred stroke and 200-, 400-, and four 50-m front crawl sprints (4 x 50 m) before and after the lockdown period. Critical speed as an index of aerobic endurance was calculated using (1) 50-, 300-, and (2) 200-, 400-m tests. Blood lactate concentration was measured after the 400- and 4 x 50-m tests. To evaluate strength-related abilities, the dryland tests included handgrip and shoulder isometric strength. Tethered swimming force was measured during a 10-second sprint. During the lockdown period, dryland training was applied, and the session rating of perceived exertion training (sRPE) load was recorded daily. Results: sRPE training load during the lockdown was decreased by 78% (16%), and critical speed was reduced 4.7% to 4.9% compared to prelockdown period (P <.05). Performance time in 200, 300, and 400 m deteriorated 2.6% to 3.9% (P <.05), while it remained unaltered in 4 x 50- and 50-m tests (P >.05). Tethered force increased 9% ( 10%) ( P <.01), but handgrip and shoulder isometric force remained unaltered (P >.05). Blood lactate concentration decreased 19% (21%) after the 400-m test and was unchanged following the 4 x 50-m tests ( P >.05). Conclusions: Performance deterioration in the 200, 300, and 400 m indicates reduced aerobic fitness and impaired technical ability, while strength and repeated-sprint ability were maintained. When a long abstention from swimming training is forced, dryland training may facilitate preservation in short-distance but not middle-distance swimming performance.

J	Li, SL; Bowker, MA; Xiao, B				Li, Shenglong; Bowker, Matthew A.; Xiao, Bo			Biocrusts enhance non-rainfall water deposition and alter its distribution in dryland soils	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Non-rainfall water deposition is an important water resource, critical for the survival of dryland vegetation and soil biota and maintaining dryland water balance. As a "living skin", biocrusts are attracting increasing attention due to their potentially positive impacts on non-rainfall water deposition. However, the magnitude and underlying mechanisms of biocrust regulation of non-rainfall water are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the non-rainfall water deposition and distribution through continuous weighing micro-lysimeters (0-3, 3-6, and 6-10 cm depths) with bare soil and three types of biocrusts (cyanobacterial crusts, cyanobacterial-moss mixed crusts, and moss crusts) in a semiarid region of the Chinese Loess Plateau. Our results showed that the biocrusts were associated with significantly greater non-rainfall water deposition capacity (similar to 13%-22%) in contrast to the bare soil, and biocrust type strongly influenced the daily non-rainfall water amount in the order: moss crusts > mixed crusts > cyanobacterial crusts > bare soil. Biocrusts were also associated with faster rates of non-rainfall water formation (42%; F >= 2.87, P <= 0.04), which may be linked to faster nighttime cooling in comparison to the bare soil. Atmospheric vapor condensation was the primary water source for non-rainfall water deposition at the 0-10 cm depth, as opposed to soil vapor condensation. Biocrusts had higher condensation from both sources, and had relatively more deposition from the atmosphere: atmospheric vapor condensation was greater by 114%143% and soil vapor condensation was greater by 20%-30%. Moreover, >69% of the total non-rainfall water amount occurred in the top 3 cm of soil. The strong biocrust influence in the uppermost centimeters (F = 45.34, P < 0.001) appears to primarily drive the contrasts in non-rainfall water deposition in soils. Furthermore, all of the apparent effects of biocrusts on non-rainfall water deposition and distribution were reasonably attributed to the biocrust influences on soil physicochemical properties, especially the contents of fine particles, organic matter, high soil roughness, daily temperature difference, and moss morphology. In conclusion, biocrusts are associated with much greater non-rainfall water deposition capacity, and change non-rainfall water distribution along with soil depth, implying that they play a critical role in surface soil water balance of dryland ecosystems.

A meta-analysis contrasting active versus passive restoration practices in dryland agricultural ecosystems	PEERJ												Restoration of agricultural drylands globally, here farmlands and grazing lands, is a priority for ecosystem function and biodiversity preservation. Natural areas in drylands are recognized as biodiversity hotspots and face continued human impacts. Global water shortages are driving increased agricultural land retirement providing the opportunity to reclaim some of these lands for natural habitat. We used meta-analysis to contrast different classes of dryland restoration practices. All interventions were categorized as active and passive for the analyses of efficacy in dryland agricultural ecosystems. We evaluated the impact of 19 specific restoration practices from 42 studies on soil, plant, animal, and general habitat targets across 16 countries, for a total of 1,427 independent observations. Passive vegetation restoration and grazing exclusion led to net positive restoration outcomes. Passive restoration practices were more variable and less effective than active restoration practices. Furthermore, passive soil restoration led to net negative restoration outcomes. Active restoration practices consistently led to positive outcomes for soil, plant, and habitat targets. Water supplementation was the most effective restoration practice. These findings suggest that active interventions are necessary and critical in most instances for dryland agricultural ecosystems likely because of severe anthropogenic pressures and concurrent environmental stressors-both past and present.

Dynamic global vegetation models underestimate net CO<sub>2</sub> flux mean and inter-annual variability in dryland ecosystems	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Despite their sparse vegetation, dryland regions exert a huge influence over global biogeochemical cycles because they cover more than 40% of the world surface (Schimel 2010 Science 327 418-9). It is thought that drylands dominate the inter-annual variability (IAV) and long-term trend in the global carbon (C) cycle (Poulter et al 2014 Nature 509 600-3, Ahlstrom et al 2015 Science 348 895-9, Zhang et al 2018 Glob. Change Biol. 24 3954-68). Projections of the global land C sink therefore rely on accurate representation of dryland C cycle processes; however, the dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) used in future projections have rarely been evaluated against dryland C flux data. Here, we carried out an evaluation of 14 DGVMs (TRENDY v7) against net ecosystem exchange (NEE) data from 12 dryland flux sites in the southwestern US encompassing a range of ecosystem types (forests, shrub- and grasslands). We find that all the models underestimate both mean annual C uptake/release as well as the magnitude of NEE IAV, suggesting that improvements in representing dryland regions may improve global C cycle projections. Across all models, the sensitivity and timing of ecosystem C uptake to plant available moisture was at fault. Spring biases in gross primary production (GPP) dominate the underestimate of mean annual NEE, whereas models' lack of GPP response to water availability in both spring and summer monsoon are responsible for inability to capture NEE IAV. Errors in GPP moisture sensitivity at high elevation forested sites were more prominent during the spring, while errors at the low elevation shrub and grass-dominated sites were more important during the monsoon. We propose a range of hypotheses for why model GPP does not respond sufficiently to changing water availability that can serve as a guide for future dryland DGVM developments. Our analysis suggests that improvements in modeling C cycle processes across more than a quarter of the Earth's land surface could be achieved by addressing the moisture sensitivity of dryland C uptake.

However, an insufficient understanding of the balance between contrasting sectors of the foodwater-ecosystem nexus results in ineffectiveness in supporting complex environmental management (CEM), leading to undesirable ERP failures. The Ordos Plateau case identified the nexus evolution and the non-linear interactions between sectors, which were expected to support adaptive strategy formulations for CEM and achieve win-win outcomes. Revegetation in drylands substantially boosted ecosystem restoration, alleviating soil erosion. However, the excessive reliance on returning cropland to woodland and grassland has caused a significant loss of arable and grazing land. During the initial period of ERPs, this exacerbated decline in grain and meat productivity. In addition, aggressive revegetation activities have also reduced runoff yield and depleted soil water resources. Water scarcity is recognized as the most challenging issue in dryland ecosystem restoration, heavily influencing the interactions between sectors and threatening the long-term sustainability of ERPs. To accommodate for regional water carrying capacity, ERPs should adopt and properly allocate the use of suitable plant species with a proven anti-drought capability and high survival ratios without additional human interventions. In addition, the evolution regimes, driving factors, critical thresholds, and complex feedbacks between the nexus sectors should be fully understood to address the water resources constraints and reconcile trade-offs. This would enable the prevention of ecosystem shifts to undesirable failures and inform timely and cost-effective CEM to achieve the LDN targets. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Hence, revealing the response of forest resilience to drought is crucial to predict forest succession in dryland mountains under future global warming. Here, we chose the Qilian Mountains as the study area and calculated the recovery time and drought intensity along elevation from 1982 to 2020 using the Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). Then, the forest resilience to drought was calculated using the area of an exponentially fitted curve between drought intensity and corresponding recovery time. Finally, the dominant climate factors underlying altitude differentiation of forest resilience were analyzed using a random forest (RF) regression model, and correlations were determined based on a generalized additive model (GAM). The results indicate that forests in the elevation range of 2600-3900 m exhibited faster recovery rates and greater resilience compared to those in 1700-2600 m. The attributional analysis shows that altitudinal differentiation of forest resilience to drought was mainly constrained by precipitation with a non-monotonic correlation, and resilience was strongest when monthly precipitation reaches 30 mm. In terms of the occurrence of historical drought events, increased potential evapotranspiration improved resilience in the elevation range of 2600-3900 m and enhanced cloud cover initially enlarged the resilience and then decreased it in the elevation range of 3000-3400 m and 3400-3900 m, with resilience being strongest when cloud cover reached 24% and 33%, respectively. Under future climate change, global warming will further exacerbate the drought impact in arid regions, increasing the risk of primary forest collapse. The results of this study provide a scientific basis for predicting the potential changes in vegetation resilience and developing policies for ecological protection in dryland mountains, and we will take addressing the difficult study of the quantitative effects of tree species on resilience altitude differentiation based on ecosystem scales as our future direction.

JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												Drylands are highly vulnerable to land degradation, and despite increasing efforts, restoration success remains low. Although often ignored in the design and deployment of management strategies, soil microbial communities might be critical for dryland restoration due to their central role in promoting soil stability, nutrient cycling and plant establishment. We collected soil samples from eight dryland restoration sites within RestoreNet, a restoration field trial network, and determined their soil microbiome using 16S rRNA (bacteria and archaea) and ITS (fungi) amplicon sequencing. Each previously degraded site was treated with monoculture (single species) and polyculture (multiple species) seedling plantings. Contrary to our initial expectations, we found that these different revegetation interventions did not trigger changes in microbial diversity, composition or relative abundance of functional groups across sites after 1 year of revegetation. Synthesis and applications. Considering the crucial role of soil micro-organisms in dryland ecosystem functions, our results suggest that site-specific targeted microbiome restoration should be considered to accelerate the establishment of desired microbial communities. Plant community-based restoration practices such as revegetation have a limited impact on soil micro-organisms in the short term.

A meta-analysis	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Plastic-film mulching (PM) has been widely adopted for dryland maize (Zea mays L.) in the Loess Plateau of China, whereas its impact on grain yield (GY) varies considerably. Therefore, it is crucial to make some feasible strategies that aim to improve the productivity of PM systems. Using the data obtained from peer-reviewed publications, we conducted a meta-analysis to (1) analyze the climate regions where maize GY increase induced by PM (GY-I) was greater than zero and (2) determine the optimum conditions of soil properties and field management practices for PM application considering both GY-I and actual GY under PM (GY-P). The results showed that on average, PM significantly increased maize GY by 56.10%, as compared with no-mulching, which was a result of increased aboveground biomass at harvest, harvest index, ear number per square meter, kernel number per row, and hundred kernel weight. PM could extend maize cultivation to drier and colder areas with mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 203.8-281.3 mm and mean annual temperature (MAT) of 3.3-4.6 degrees C, where an average GY of about 1866 kg ha(-1) could be achieved under PM. However, as MAP and MAT continued to increase, GY-I decreased linearly and reached zero at MAP and MAT of 627.6 mm and 13.1 degrees C, respectively. GY-I and GY-P were both significantly affected by soil bulk density (SBD), plant density (PD), nitrogen fertilizer rate (NFR), and phosphorus fertilizer rate (PFR). Increasing SBD, NFR, and PFR tended to reduce GY-I, but GY-P showed an inverted U-shaped relationship with SBD and changed from increasing to constant with increasing NFR and PFR. As PD increased, GY-I decreased at first and then increased, while GY-P was observed to change oppositely. It was suggested that PM be adopted at SBD, NFR, PFR, and PD of 1.14-1.30 g cm(-3), 160-220 kg N ha(-1), 105-135 kg P2O5 ha(-1), and 72,000-80,000 plants ha(-1), respectively. In conclusion, PM usually has a positive effect on maize production in the Chinese Loess Plateau. However, for optimizing the PM effect in practice, we must consider climate, soil properties, field management practices, GY-I, and GY-P.					cheng, shu/IZE-4788-2023														0378-3774	1873-2283				OCT 1	2020	240								106290	10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106290	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106290													WOS:000546646400022

RestoreNet: An emerging restoration network reveals controls on seeding success across dryland ecosystems	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												Drylands are Earth's largest terrestrial biome and support one-third of the global population. However, they are also highly vulnerable to land degradation. Despite widespread demand for dryland restoration and rehabilitation, little information is available to help land managers effectively re-establish native perennial vegetation across drylands. RestoreNet is an emerging dryland restoration network that systematically tests revegetation techniques across environmental gradients. Using the RestoreNet experimental framework, we tested the effectiveness of restoration treatments (i.e. ConMod nurse plant structures, mulch, pits) that increase soil moisture and seed mixes with different climatic niches to achieve revegetation goals. Across sites, seedling recruitment was consistently influenced by treatment and seed mix type. Pit and mulch treatments increased total seedling density, with pits promoting the highest seeded species recruitment while limiting non-native species establishment. Seeding increased total seedling density regardless of seed mix type, but cooler-adapted seed mixes promoted greater seeded species density and resulted in lower density of unseeded (non-native) species relative to warmer-adapted mixes. Seedling recruitment was also controlled by the temporal and environmental context of restoration with the positive effect of high precipitation greatest in the weeks immediately following seeding. Above-average precipitation during the study period across most of the sites may partially explain why the highest seeded species recruitment occurred in pit treatments and seed mixes with cooler, wetter niche requirements. Synthesis and applications. Results from the dryland restoration network, RestoreNet help to better understand variation in seeding and restoration treatment success across space and time in drylands. Relationships between restoration practices and environmental conditions in our study suggest the importance of anticipatory restoration strategies that forecast seasonal and sub-seasonal weather conditions and select plant species with climate niche requirements appropriate for current and future climate conditions. This information is critical to land managers tasked with improving ecosystem conditions across degraded dryland regions.

Scouringrush (<i>Equisetum</i> spp.) control in dryland winter wheat	WEED TECHNOLOGY												The adoption of chemical fallow rotations in Pacific Northwest dryland winter wheat production has caused a weed species composition shift in which scouringrush has established in production fields. Thus, there has been interest in identifying herbicides that effectively control scouringrush in winter wheat-chemical fallow cropping systems. Field experiments were established in growers' fields near Reardan, WA, in 2014, and The Dalles, OR, in 2015. Ten herbicide treatments were applied to mowed and nonmowed plots during chemical fallow rotations. Scouringrush stem densities were quantified the following spring and after wheat harvest at both locations. Chlorsulfuron plus MCPA-ester resulted in nearly 100% control of scouringrush through wheat harvest. Before herbicide application, mowing had no effect on herbicide efficacy. We conclude chlorsulfuron plus MCPA-ester is a commercially acceptable treatment for smooth and intermediate scouringrush control in winter wheat-chemical fallow cropping systems; however, the lack of a positive yield response when scouringrushes were controlled should factor into management decisions.																			0890-037X	1550-2740				DEC	2019	33	6					808	814	PII S0890037X19000459	10.1017/wet.2019.45	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/wet.2019.45													WOS:000502954900007

Findings indicate that regression equations, differential equations, flow routing, experimental approaches and water balances are most widely used. Geographic Information Systems are becoming a convenient framework to display model results showing spatial variability of losses. In the United States, regression equations and experimental approaches involving controlled releases are widely used to assess transmission losses whereas in the dryland regions of Australia, water balance and flow routing approaches are popular. In Africa and Asia, regression equations and water balances are common approaches to estimate transmission losses. By using regression equations on data pooled from studies done in different dryland regions of the world, statistically significant (p<0.05) relationships were observed between transmission loss volume and, reach length, inflow, flow contributing area and runoff coefficient. Overall, the review underscores the importance of channel and catchment characteristics in shaping the dynamics of transmission losses. Two main limitations of the current approaches are that they are site-specific and require high amounts of data not always available in dryland regions due to sparse network of monitoring stations. The review also highlights existing knowledge gaps and future research needs.

However, with global warming-induced gradual increase in soil temperature, film-mulched spring maize experiences premature senescence and yield loss. In this study, a new form of mulching strategy involving dual mulching of transparent plastic film with whole maize stalks in a flat plot was established to improve growth and increase water use efficiency (WUE), precipitation use efficiency (PUE), and spring maize yield. The field experiment was conducted in 20 182 019, and 2020 on a conventional flat plot without mulching (CK), a flat plot with single transparent PFM, and a flat plot of transparent film mulching with whole maize stalks (PFM+ST) in the dryland of the Loess Plateau in China, to quantify the effects of different treatments on soil hydrothermal conditions, maize phenology, plant growth dynamics, WUE, PUE, and maize yield. Results demonstrated that soil water storage (SWS) at 0-100 cm soil layer in PFM and PFM+ST were significantly superior to those in CK, but SWS did not significantly differ between PFM and PFM+ST. Soil temperature under PFM+ST at 0-25 cm soil layer decreased by 1.2 celcius compared with that under PFM during growth, especially in early growing seasons (20-60 days after sowing [DAS]). PFM+ST extended vegetative and reproductive growth periods by 1-2 and 6-7 days compared with those in PFM, respectively. In later growth period (80-120 DAS), PFM+ST increased the root dry matter weight, SPAD, and LAI and significantly increased the aboveground dry matter accumulation. PFM+ST significantly increased the 100-kernel dry weight, grain yield, WUE, and PUE. PFM+ST had 3-year average grain yields of 10.82% and 36.48% greater than PFM and CK, respectively. The corresponding WUE and in 0-200 cm soil layer improved by 12.55% and 39.84%, and PUE improved by 10.82% and 36.48%, respectively. With global warming, applying PFM+ST cultivation practice effectively extended growth period and increased mulching spring maize yield and WUE in the study site.

Clinal variations in seedling traits and responses to water availability correspond to seed-source environmental gradients in a foundational dryland tree species	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Background and Aims In dryland ecosystems, conifer species are threatened by more frequent and severe droughts, which can push species beyond their physiological limits. Adequate seedling establishment will be critical for future resilience to global change. We used a common garden glasshouse experiment to determine how seedling functional trait expression and plasticity varied among seed sources in response to a gradient of water availability, focusing on a foundational dryland tree species of the western USA, Pinus monophylla. We hypothesized that the expression of growth-related seedling traits would show patterns consistent with local adaptation, given clinal variation among seed source environments. Methods We collected P. monophylla seeds from 23 sites distributed across rangewide gradients of aridity and seasonal moisture availability. A total of 3320 seedlings were propagated with four watering treatments representing progressively decreasing water availability. Above- and below-ground growth-related traits of first-year seedlings were measured. Trait values and trait plasticity, here representing the degree of variation among watering treatments, were modelled as a function of watering treatment and environmental conditions at the seed source locations (i.e. water availability, precipitation seasonality). Key Results We found that, under all treatments, seedlings from more arid climates had larger above- and below-ground biomass compared to seedlings from sites experiencing lower growing-season water limitation, even after accounting for differences in seed size. Additionally, trait plasticity in response to watering treatments was greatest for seedlings from summer-wet sites that experience periodic monsoonal rain events. Conclusions Our results show that P. monophylla seedlings respond to drought through plasticity in multiple traits, but variation in trait responses suggests that different populations are likely to respond uniquely to changes in local climate. Such trait diversity will probably influence the potential for future seedling recruitment in woodlands that are projected to experience extensive drought-related tree mortality.

Plants Treated with Organic and Inorganic Fertilizers under Dryland Farming System	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL PLANTS AND BY-PRODUCTS-JMPB												The use of environmental friendly fertilizers is the main agricultural practice to improve the plant quality and quantity. The present study aims to assess the effect of organic and inorganic fertilizers on flower and stigma yield, biochemical properties and essential oil (EO) composition of saffron (Crocus Sativus L.) in research station of Hamand Absard, Iran. The plants were treated with cattle manure (20 t ha(-1)) and foliar application of delfard (7 kg ha(-1)) and floral P (2.5 kg ha(-1)) in a completely randomized block design (CRBD) with three replications under dryland farming system. The results showed significant increases of flower number and yield under all fertilizers compared to control. The yield of fresh and dry stigma under manure application was higher than floral and delfard. The response of chlorophyll (Chl) concentration was different under fertilizers. Floral and manure application led to higher Chl a compared to control. Chl b under manure and delfard was significantly higher than control and floral. TPC and TFC were significantly improved by organic and inorganic fertilizers. The main improvement of TPC and TFC was obtained under manure application followed by floral and delfard. GC/MS analysis showed the main EO composition were Methyl pentanoate (25.8- 62.15%) followed by Dihydro- beta- ionol (17.7-34.79%), and hexadecyl acetate (4.9-9.4%), representing different responses to fertilizers. To sum up, the best fertilizer to improve the yield of saffron was manure followed by floral and delfard.

Influence of hydroclimatic variability on dengue incidence in a tropical dryland area	ACTA TROPICA												Dengue is an endemic disease in more than 100 countries, but there are few studies about the effects of hydroclimatic variability on dengue incidence (DI) in tropical dryland areas. This study investigates the association between hydroclimatic variability and DI (2008-2018) in a large tropical dryland area. The area studied comprehends seven municipalities with populations ranging from 32,879 to 2,545,419 inhabitants. First, the precipitation and temperature impacts on interannual and seasonal DI were investigated. Then, the monthly association between DI and hydroclimatic variables was analyzed using generalized least squares (GLS) regression. The model's capability to reproduce DI given the current hydroclimatic conditions and DI seasonality over the entire time period studied were assessed. No association between the interannual variation of precipitation and DI was found. However, seasonal variation of DI was shaped by precipitation and temperature. February-July was the main dengue season period. A precipitation threshold, usually above 100 mm, triggers the rapid DI rising. Precipitation and minimum air temperature were the main explanatory variables. A two-month -lagged predictor was relevant for modeling, occurring in all regressions, followed by a non-lagged predictor. The climate predictors differed among the regression models, revealing the high spatial DI variability driven by hydroclimatic variability. GLS regressions were able to reproduce the beginning, development, and end of the dengue season, although we found underestimation of DI peaks and overestimation of low DI. These model limitations are not an issue for climate change impact assessment on DI at the municipality scale since historical DI seasonality was well simulated. However, they may not allow seasonal DI forecasting for some municipalities. These findings may help not only public health policies in the studied municipalities but also have the potential to be reproducible for other dryland regions with similar data availability.

There remain significant uncertainties on the extent to which these events over dryland vegetation can be monitored and assessed with satellite data. In this study, we investigated the vegetation responses of the major Australian semiarid biomes to two extreme wet events utilizing multi-satellite observations of (1) solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), as a proxy for photosynthetic activity and (2) the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), as a measure of canopy chlorophyll or greenness. We related these satellite observations with gross primary productivity (GPP) estimated from eddy covariance tower sites, as a performance benchmark. The C-3-dominated Mulga woodland was the most responsive biome to both wet pulses and exhibited the highest sensitivity to soil moisture. The C-4-dominated Hummock grassland was more responsive to the 2011 "big wet" event, relative to the later 2016-2017 wet pulse. EVI swiftly responded to the extreme wet events and showed markedly amplified seasonal amplitude, however, there was a time lag as compared with SIF during the post-wet period, presumably due to the relatively slower chlorophyll degradation in contrast with declines in photosynthetic activity. Despite a robust linear SIF-GPP relationship (r(2) ranging from 0.59 to 0.85), the spatially coarse SIF derived from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) yielded high retrieval noise over the xeric biomes, hindering its capacity to capture thoroughly the dryland vegetation dynamics in central Australia. Our study highlights that synchronous satellite observations of greenness and fluorescence can potentially offer an improved understanding of dryland vegetation dynamics and can advance our ability to detect ecosystem alterations under future changing climates.

Cropping System Diversification Influences Soil Microbial Diversity in Subtropical Dryland Farming Systems	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Conventional dryland cropping systems are characterised by low crop diversity and frequent fallows. This has significant impacts on soil microbes that underpin soil function. Diversifying crop rotations can potentially counter these effects; however, limited data exists on the impacts of diversified crop rotations on soil microbes in drylands. Using phylogenetic marker gene sequencing, we characterised soil microbial diversity in conventional and diversified dryland crop rotations in subtropical Australia. This included winter and summer dominant rotations. Conventional systems were cereal-dominant with a crop-fallow rotation. Diversified systems included greater crop diversity, double crops, cover crops, and a multi-year ley pasture. In summer rotations with increased crop diversity and cover crops, bacterial and fungal richness increased, and distinct communities were formed compared to fallow land. Often, these community shifts were associated with greater soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen. All winter rotations had distinct fungal communities and ley pasture resulted in greater fungal diversity compared to other rotations. No effects of the winter rotations were evident on bacterial communities. Our results show that diversification of dryland crop rotations leads to significant shifts in soil microbial communities in both winter and summer cropping systems. Both summer and winter rotations incorporating cover crops and ley pasture had greater soil respiration and nitrogen, indicating increases in soil fertility. These rotations may offer an alternative to conventional crop-fallow rotations to counter ongoing declines in soil health.

It has been suggested that a future surface drying trend would largely reduce gross primary productivity (GPP) in drylands, given that water is the dominant factor controlling the spatial distributions (i.e., space-for-time analogy) and inter-annual fluctuations (i.e., variability-for-time analogy) of dryland GPP. However, whether these approaches using spatial and inter-annual diagnostics are valid to infer longterm dryland GPP remains unknown. In this study, we evaluate whether space-fortime and variability-for-time approaches, which are based on the empirical scaling between GPP and dryness, are able to capture future changes in dryland GPP as simulated by 18 Earth system models (ESMs). Using observational data during 1958-2014, we identify a strong coupling between dryland GPP and the annual aridity index (Al, the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration) over both spatial and inter-annual scales. This GPP-Al scaling is used to predict future GPP changes throughout the 21st Century based on the future Al changes projected by ESMs. The space-for-time, and variability-for-time approaches predict an overall decrease of dryland GPP by -23.66 +/- 10.93 (mean +/- 1 standard deviation) and -3.86 +/- 2.22 gC m(-2) yr(-1), respectively, in response to future surface drying, however, the ESM projections exhibit a strong dryland GPP increase (+81.42 +/- 36.82 gC m(-2) yr(-1)). This inconsistency is because the space- and variability-based approaches, which rely on the spatial or short-term GPP-Al relationships, cannot capture the slowly-evolving but key determinant of dryland GPP changes over multi-decadal or longer timescales, which, in ESMs, is the ecosystem physiological response to rising CO2. Our study questions the validity of "the drier the less productive" hypothesis rooted in the space-for-time and variability-for-time theories, and the implementation of such theories to constrain future ecosystem changes.

J	Shiferaw, H; Bewket, W; Eckert, S				Shiferaw, Hailu; Bewket, Woldeamlak; Eckert, Sandra			Performances of machine learning algorithms for mapping fractional cover of an invasive plant species in a dryland ecosystem	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												In recent years, an increasing number of distribution maps of invasive alien plant species (IAPS) have been published using different machine learning algorithms (MLAs). However, for designing spatially explicit management strategies, distribution maps should include information on the local cover/abundance of the IAPS. This study compares the performances of five MLAs: gradient boosting machine in two different implementations, random forest, support vector machine and deep learning neural network, one ensemble model and a generalized linear model; thereby identifying the best-performing ones in mapping the fractional cover/abundance and distribution of IPAS, in this case called Prosopis juliflora (SW. DC.). Field level Prosopis cover and spatial datasets of seventeen biophysical and anthropogenic variables were collected, processed, and used to train and validate the algorithms so as to generate fractional cover maps of Prosopis in the dryland ecosystem of the Afar Region, Ethiopia. Out of the seven tested algorithms, random forest performed the best with an accuracy of 92% and sensitivity and specificity >0.89. The next best-performing algorithms were the ensemble model and gradient boosting machine with an accuracy of 89% and 88%, respectively. The other tested algorithms achieved comparably low performances. The strong explanatory variables for Prosopis distributions in all models were NDVI, elevation, distance to villages and distance to rivers; rainfall, temperature, near-infrared and red reflectance, whereas topographic variables, except for elevation, did not contribute much to the current distribution of Prosopis. According to the random forest model, a total of 1.173 million ha (12.33% of the study region) was found to be invaded by Prosopis to varying degrees of cover. Our findings demonstrate that MLAs can be successfully used to develop fractional cover maps of plant species, particularly IAPS so as to design targeted and spatially explicit management strategies.

In the semi-arid region of western Liaoning, China, agricultural films have been widely utilized to enhance crop production over an extended period. However, there is a scarcity of research on the presence of MPs in the soil of farmlands in this area. Consequently, a total of 25 dryland soil samples from western Liaoning that had been mulched for more than 10 years and had been used to grow a variety of crops were gathered for the current study. The abundance, particle size, shape, and potential sources of MPs were examined, and the impact of different crop varieties on MPs characteristics was investigated. MPs abundance ranged from 6960 +/- 1939 to 34,710 +/- 9974 n kg-1, with the average and median of 14,305 +/- 7015 and 12,270 +/- 1621 n kg-1. MPs with sizes of less than 0.05, 0.05-0.1, and 0.1-0.4 mm were found in 42.7%, 33.8%, and 18.8% of cases, respectively. The most common shapes were fragments, microbeads, and films, with percentages of 47.1%, 22.3%, and 17.9%, respectively. A total of three polymers were found: polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene in a proportion of 44.8%, 43.7%, and 11.5%, respectively. Based on the shape of the MPs, principal component analysis and cluster analysis revealed that the primary sources for MPs may be agricultural mulch, irrigation water, and the weathering of hard plastics like agricultural packaging. Compared to other crop types, soils growing sweet potato and peanut had significantly higher MP abundances. Moreover, soils growing sweet potato had significantly higher percentages of MPs with 0.05-0.1 mm particle size. Regardless of the crop type grown, fragments are the most common shape, while the proportion of other shapes varies depending on the crop type. The aforementioned findings suggest that MP pollution in farmland soil in western Liaoning is more severe and that the kind of crop cultivation affects the characteristics of MPs in the soil.																			1085-3278	1099-145X				2023 DEC 11	2023										10.1002/ldr.4999	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4999		DEC 2023											WOS:001121300300001

The main objective of this research was to evaluate seeding rate responses for popular dryland winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties and determine if variety specific seeding rates were warranted. The study was conducted from 2015 through 2018 at Colby, Garden City, and Tribune, KS. The response of four winter wheat varieties Byrd, T158, TAM 111 or TAM 114, and Winterhawk at five seeding rates (34, 50, 67, 84, and 101 kg ha(-1)) were studied. The main effects of seeding rate and variety affected grain yield in all 12 environments with only one exception. The lowest yielding seeding rate was 34 kg ha(-1) with seeding rates of 84 and 101 kg ha(-1) producing the greatest yields in all years and locations. Averaged across site-years, there was a 17% yield advantage from selecting seeding rates 67 kg ha(-1) and greater compared with the lowest seeding rate (34 kg ha(-1)). A combination of two or more yield components was a good predictor for wheat yield response to increased seeding rate. Lower than optimum seeding rates reduced grain yield while no agronomic penalty was observed to seeding rates above the optimum. We concluded a seeding rate of 67 kg ha(-1) or more and variety selection are important factors for dryland winter wheat yield in the central Great Plains region. Results of this study do not support the necessity of variety specific seeding rate for dryland wheat production in the central Great Plains.

Land degradation neutrality is a challenging sustainability goal in drylands, for which ecological restoration has to transcend the scale of land degradation. Actions on ecological restoration are prevalent in global drylands driving changes of ecosystem services across local to regional scales. This paper focuses on the Chinese Loess Plateau as a typical dryland region experiencing decades of ecological restoration. The research progress on the multiscale monitoring, assessment, and modelling of ecosystem services driven by ecological restoration is succinctly reviewed. To enhance the bridging capability of dryland ecosystem service science among ecosystem integrity and resilience, sustainable livelihood, and adaptive landscape management, a research framework is proposed considering dryland sustainability goals, ecosystems, socioeconomic systems, and the multidimensional systematic interactions. Under this framework, the research gaps and further critical themes are discussed for advancing a sustainability oriented ecosystem service science for drylands.

J	Sun, YY; Zhang, SQ; Yan, JK				Sun, Yingying; Zhang, Suiqi; Yan, Jiakun			Contribution of green organs to grain weight in dryland wheat from the 1940s to the 2010s in Shaanxi Province, China	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Eight dryland winter wheat cultivars (Triticum aestivum L.), which were widely cultivated from the 1940s to the 2010s in Shaanxi Province, China, were selected and grown in plots, and two water treatments (irrigation and drought) were used to identify the contribution of ears, leaves and stems to grain weight and grain number associated with cultivar replacement. The plant height and stem dry weight of the dryland wheat decreased significantly during the cultivar replacement process, but there was a remarkable increase in the dry matter translocation of stems under irrigation. Shaded-ear and defoliation treatment could decrease the grain number and grain weight, and the grain weight was more influenced. Both the leaf and ear are important photosynthetic sources for dryland wheat, and the contribution of ear assimilates showed a significant increase over time; however, the contribution of leaf assimilates showed a negative correlation with cultivation over time. The accumulation of stem assimilates and ear photosynthesis both increased the grain weight potential. In the future breeding process, cultivars with more assimilates stored in the stem and greater assimilative capacity of ears, especially a greater contribution of ear assimilates, are expected to increase the grain yield.					yan, jiakun/GRJ-3297-2022; Yan, Jiakun/AAN-5352-2020	yan, jiakun/0000-0001-8844-6098; Yan, Jiakun/0000-0001-8844-6098													2045-2322					FEB 9	2021	11	1							3377	10.1038/s41598-021-82718-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-82718-y								33564020					WOS:000684869100002

Depositional controls on sediment properties in dryland rivers: Influence on near-surface diagenesis	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Sandy braided dryland rivers, deposited under arid to semi-arid conditions, constitute important clastic reservoirs worldwide whose reservoir quality reflects the effect of primary sediment properties on near-surface diagenetic processes. A literature review is presented of existing facies models, based on geomorphological analysis of modern perennial braided rivers, further illustrated with own outcrop and subsurface examples of dryland river deposits in: (a) Argana Basin (Triassic, Morocco), (b) Iberian Meseta (Triassic, Central SE Spain), (c) Huesca Fluvial Fan (Miocene, Spain) and (d) Rotliegend hydrocarbon reservoir in the Southern Permian Basin (The Netherlands). The facies models, combined with the analyses of the rock record, provides a comprehensive depositional framework where the influence of depositional characteristics, such as grain-size and sorting variations, interstitial clay distribution and composition and amount of intrabasinal components, on the extent and pathway of near-surface mechanical and chemical processes can be investigated. The particular dryland setting is characterized by prolonged periods of inactivity and short, episodic periods of peak discharge, which lead to the transport and deposition of poorly-sorted, clay-rich extra- and intraformational conglomeratic sediments upstream. Downstream, channels, mid-channel and bank-attached bars develop with conspicuous anisotropic trough and tabular cross-stratified sandstones. The most common near-surface diagenetic processes that alter the textural properties of these deposits are the rapid decrease of porosity and permeability due to grain-rearrangements and mechanical compaction of mud intraclasts along with pervasive early carbonate cementation. The results of this study will help to better configure the boundary conditions (e.g., external versus local supply for carbonates cements) in state-of-the-art reservoir quality forward models for ancient dryland river sandstones, which are especially prominent in Devonian, Permian, Triassic and Jurassic reservoir settings.

The barren soil dominated by eolian sedimentary loess is loose and erosive. For thousands of years, increasing human population pressure and high-intensity disordered land use have led to serious ecosystem degradation. Since the 1950s, large-scale and long-term construction of terraced fields have effectively reduced the soil erosion potential, and such fields have become more and more convenient for mechanized large-area production. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the crop cultivation system based on the RFM has been widely promoted. Compared with previous cropping systems, the crop productivity in the RFM system is double or multiple times greater. Soil moisture has become favorable. Soil organic C content has been controlled or increased. Most importantly, the RFM system has promoted the coordinated development of grain, forage, and livestock, and favorable market results. It has vigorously promoted the fight against poverty and the realization of the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in dryland areas. Therefore, ridge-furrow mulching is the key basis for the sustainable development of the dryland farming system on the Loess Plateau.

The role of ecohydrological (dis)connectivity in dryland functioning and management	ECOSISTEMAS												Connectivity is defined as the degree to which the spatial structure of the landscape facilitates the flow of organisms and materials. Various conceptual models and empirical evidence attribute a key role to hydrological connectivity in the functioning of dryland ecosystems and landscapes, yet an integrated perspective on the different facets and processes that link connectivity with the degradation and recovery of drylands is still lacking. Here, we describe ecohydrological connectivity as an emergent property of ecosystems and landscapes that captures the interaction between hydrological connectivity and ecological proceses, and discuss how ecohydrological connectivity controls dryland ecosystem functioning, underlies the dynamics of desertification, and can be managed to facilitate the recovery of degraded drylands. A dysfunctional ecohydrological connectivity would be one in which most of the resource flow associated with bare soil connectivity at the slope or landscape scale cannot be retained and exploited by the sink effect of vegetation. Actions for the recovery of the degraded system would be aimed at interrupting the general connectivity of the bare soil matrix, promoting source-sink dynamics and enhancing the sink capacity of the vegetation patches or tiles. At the landscape scale, the disruption of hydrological connectivity can, in turn, create habitat patches and corridors for a wide variety of species, facilitating their movements and thus their conservation and adaptation to climate change.

J	Zeng, YX; Liu, Y; Yu, XB				Zeng, Yingxi; Liu, Yu; Yu, Xiubo			Contribution of hydrological connectivity to the retention of soil organic carbon by vegetation patches: Insight from a dryland hillslope on the Loess Plateau, China	CATENA												Hydrological connectivity affects the carbon capture and redistribution over landscapes. However, the contribution of hydrological connectivity to the spatial heterogeneity of carbon sequestration, particularly the spatial variation of carbon retention, is not well covered in carbon inventory and estimation. This study addressed the contribution of hydrological connectivity to the soil carbon retention on a hillslope with a mosaic of shrub patches and inter-shrub area covered by grass, biological crust and bare soil on the Loess Plateau, China. The variation of the efficiency of the shrub patches to retain SOC and the SOC difference between shrub patch and inter-shrub area among slope positions were revealed in the context of varied hydrological connectivity indicated by the contributing area. The results illustrate that the efficiency of shrub patches to retain sediment and SOC transported from upslope areas decreased from the hillslope top to the slope foot, though the morphological traits of the shrub patches did not significantly varied. The mean SOC in shrub patches declined, and increased in intershrub areas from hillslope top to slope foot. Consequently, the SOC difference between shrub patch and intershrub area declined from the top to the foot of the hillslope. These results imply that the size of contributing areas is the dominant contributor to the spatial variation of the efficiency of shrub patches to retain SOC, and the pattern of SOC difference between shrub patches and inter-shrub areas. The results highlight the necessity to incorporate the spatial heterogeneity of hydrological connectivity into evaluating the carbon retention efficiency of vegetation, especially in the dryland landscape. This study also revealed that the lack of hydrological connectivity may lead to great uncertainty in assessing SOC sequestration in terrestrial landscapes.

However, the differences in response amplitudes of dryland ecosystems to drier and wetter climates have not been frequently discussed, especially when using composite indicators at large scales. This study explores the changing patterns of ecosystem vulnerability in China's drylands by comprehensively considering exposure, sensitivity and resilience indicators using leaf area index (LAI) datasets and meteorological data within two periods from 1982 to 1999 (P1) and from 2000 to 2016 (P2). The results show that nearly 57% of China's drylands have experienced drier conditions in 2000-2016 based on the average aridity index (AI) values compared with the conditions in 1982-1999. Compared with the conditions in 1982-1999, ecosystem vulnerability has increased in 78% of dryland, and ecosystem resilience has decreased in 46% of the area in 2000-2016. The amplitudes of vulnerability increase are higher in drier conditions than in wetter conditions. Ecosystem resilience has obviously increased in wetter conditions but has decreased in drier conditions, especially in farming-pastoral ecotones with an obvious land use change. Consequently, vegetation-climate composite indicators provide a holistic pattern of China's dryland ecosystem response to climate change, and the decreased ecosystem resilience in drier conditions in northeast China should be a warning signal under the national vegetation greening background. This research highlights that the impact of drying on ecosystem resilience leads the response of ecosystems to drier environment.

A two-yr field trial was conducted in a dryland research farm in Montana with a clay loam soil to evaluate the response of spring bread wheat (cv. Velva) and durum (Triticum durum Defs cv. Joppa) to N rate (45 vs. 90 kg ha(-1)), N source (urea vs. SuperU (R)), and application method (broadcast vs. banding). Compared to broadcast application, fertilizer banding reduced plant density by 6% without affecting the final grain yield. Nitrogen rate had a significant effect on grain yield. Neither nitrogen source nor application method affected grain yield when N was applied at 90 kg N ha(-1). Grain yield increased from 3171 to 3652 kg ha(-1) with increasing N rate from 45 to 90 kg ha(-1) in the year with ample rainfall, whereas yield remained unchanged in the drier year. Protein concentration was higher in broadcasting treatment compared to banding at 90 kg N ha(-1). However, at 45 kg N ha(-1), protein concentration in the grain was not affected by method of application. The source of fertilizer did not show a significant effect on grain protein concentration. Our data indicated no agronomic benefit in using SuperU compared to conventional urea or banding fertilizer vs. broadcasting in this dryland system.																			0190-4167	1532-4087				AUG 9	2021	44	13					1930	1941		10.1080/01904167.2021.1884705	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2021.1884705		FEB 2021											WOS:000617951600001

Nutritive and non-nutritive effects of compost on organic dryland wheat in Utah	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Organic dryland wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is an important crop in Utah and the intermountain western United States; however, growers face numerous challenges maintaining yield, grain quality, soil fertility, and health. Wheat yields in the West are severely constrained by lack of rainfall, so dryland organic wheat farmers generally do not grow cover crops due to the risk of subsequent crop failure or apply soil amendments due to the inability to recoup application costs in the short term. Compost may have significant non-nutritive as well as nutritive effects on soil processes, however, potentially changing calculations of perceived costs vs. benefits. The goal of this study was to quantify the effects of a one-time compost application on soil health, yield, and crop quality in an organic dryland wheat-fallow system in northern Utah. Four rates of compost, applied once, (0, 12.5, 25, and 50 Mg ha(-1) dry weight, DW) were compared to anhydrous ammonia (50 kg N ha(-1)) applied at planting. Mineralizable C, microbial biomass, and phosphatase enzyme activity increased significantly at all compost rates, while available soil P increased at the 25 and 50 Mg ha(-1) rates and total soil N at the 50 Mg ha rate(-1). Soil moisture was generally no different between treatments. Wheat yield was significantly greater 3 yr after application at the 50 Mg ha(-1) compost rate only, with no response to conventional fertilizer. A lack of yield response to conventional fertilizer suggests that non-nutritive benefits of improved soil health were responsible for improved yields at the high compost rate.

Compared with Se0, Se2 increased the leaf area, chlorophyll content, internode length, plant height, and ear height by 7.95%, 3.20%, 13.19%, 1.89%, and 7.98%, respectively. Se2 and Se3 significantly affected the stem internode diameter, cortex thickness, and cellulose content, which were positively correlated with lodging resistance. Compared with Se0, Se3 promoted the contents of soluble sugar, crude protein, crude fat, and starch in grains, which increased by 9.48%, 6.59%, 1.56%, and 4.82%, respectively. It implies that maize grain application of Se significantly improves their Se content. Se1 did not observably influence the growth of maize, and the promoting effect of Se4 on maize decreased. The lodging resistance of maize as analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis correlated with the application of Se fertilizer. It proved that higher yield, grain quality, grain Se content, and lodging resistance of stems were concerned with Se fertilizer application in the range of 150-225 g ha(-1). The results provide useful information for Se fertilizer treatment in dryland maize.					deng, yan/JDW-8815-2023	gao, fei/0000-0003-1637-2071; Wang, Le/0000-0003-1241-6276														2223-7747				NOV	2022	11	22							3099	10.3390/plants11223099	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants11223099								36432827					WOS:000887748400001

Sensitivity of dryland vegetation patterns to storm characteristics	ECOHYDROLOGY												Ecohydrological phenomena are o ften multiscale in nature, with behavioTur that emerges from the interaction of tightly coupled systems having characteristic timescales that differ by orders of magnitude. Models address these differences using timescale separation methods, where each system is held in psuedo-steady state while the other evolves. When the computational demands of solving the 'fast' system are large, this strategy can become numerically intractable. Here, we use emulation modelling to accelerate the simulation of a computationally intensive 'fast' system: overland flow. We focus on dryland ecosystems in which storms generate overland flow, on timescales of 10(1 - 2) s. In these ecosystems, overland flow delivers crucial water inputs to vegetation, which grows and disperses 'slowly', on timescales of 10(7 - 9) s. Emulation allows for a physically realistic treatment of flow, advancing on phenomenological descriptions used in previous studies. Resolving the within-storm processes reveals novel dynamics, including new transition pathways from patchy vegetation to desertification, that are specifically controlled by storm processes.

Trevor			Drone imagery protocols to map vegetation are transferable between dryland sites across an elevational gradient	ECOSPHERE												The structure and composition of plant communities in drylands are highly variable across scales, from microsites to landscapes. Fine spatial resolution field surveys of dryland plants are essential to unravel the impact of climate change; however, traditional field data collection is challenging considering sampling efforts and costs. Unoccupied aerial systems (UAS) can alleviate this challenge by providing standardized measurements of plant community attributes with high resolution. However, given widespread heterogeneity in plant communities in drylands, and especially across environmental gradients, the transferability of UAS imagery protocols is unclear. Plant functional types (PFTs) are a classification scheme that aggregates the diversity of plant structure and function. We mapped and modeled PFTs and fractional photosynthetic cover using the same UAS imagery protocol across three dryland communities, differentiated by a landscape-scale gradient of elevation and precipitation. We compared the accuracy of the UAS products between the three dryland sites. PFT classifications and modeled photosynthetic cover had highest accuracies at higher elevations (2241 m) with denser vegetation. The lowest site (1101 m), with more bare ground, had the least agreement with the field data. Notably, shrub cover was well predicted across the gradient of elevation and precipitation (similar to 230-1100 mm/year). UAS surveys captured the heterogeneity of plant cover across sites and presented options to measure leaf-level composition and structure at landscape levels. Our results demonstrate that some PFTs (i.e., shrubs) can readily be detected across sites using the same UAS imagery protocols, while others (i.e., grasses) may require site-specific flight protocols for best accuracy. As UAS are increasingly used to monitor dryland vegetation, developing protocols that maximize information and efficiency is a research and management priority.					; Glenn, Nancy/B-4491-2014	Enterkine, Joshua/0000-0001-6956-3619; Glenn, Nancy/0000-0003-2124-7654; Caughlin, T.

Global rainfall partitioning by dryland vegetation: Developing general empirical models	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Rainfall partitioning by plant canopies can play key roles in dryland ecohydrology by altering the amount, timing and patterns of water receipt to soils. Here, we synthesized interception, throughfall and stemflow observations from 2,297 rainfall events across 40 dryland sites, including 48 plant species. Then, we developed general empirical models able to predict the response of rainfall partitioning into interception, throughfall and stemflow as a function of rainfall event size considering different functional factors (life form, bark type). Twelve linear models explained significant variability across all synthesized observations. In all cases, interception, throughfall and stemflow linearly increased as a function of rainfall event size with slope ranges of 0.149-0.174 mm of interception per mm of rainfall, 0.776-0.829 mm of throughfall per mm of rainfall, and 0.026-0.063 mm of stemflow per mm of rainfall. On the one hand, shrubs and rough-barked species presented more interception than trees and smooth-barked species, respectively. On the other hand, shrubs and smooth-barked species presented less throughfall than trees and rough-barked species, respectively. Finally, shrubs and smooth-barked species presented more stemflow than trees and rough-barked species, respectively. Our models confirm the scientific evidence found so far by other global meta-analyses but also allow us to explore the partitioning of rainfall against different scenarios. Our findings can be useful to help to predict and manage ecohydrological change in water-limited ecosystems in the context of shifting vegetation cover and climate conditions.

To address this issue, we established a mathematical model of N-opd dynamics under soil moisture gradients and performed a modeling verification from laboratory to field using wheat as testing material. In pot-culture experiment with 3 moisture gradients and 9 planting densities, the quadratic function fitting of yield-density relation indicated that old landrace and modern cultivar shared a similar increasing trend of N-opd in response to soil water availability. The biomass-density relation displayed a typical mode of asymptotical line, and conformed to the law of constant final yield. We therefore established a classic equation of N-opd=k/(alpha-1) via adopting the scaling exponent (alpha) between grain yield and body size (aboveground biomass), and the density producing half of maximum biomass (k). With the increasing drought stress, the increasing extent of k was evidently lower than alpha-1, suggesting that the N-opd decreased along with increasing drought stress. To verify the above model, we therefore performed a field experiment and found that the N-opd under the rain-fed condition (no irrigation) was lowered by 32.4% in 2017 and 16.7% in 2018 respectively, compared to that of supplemental irrigation. Interestingly, the biomass density relationship was parabolic under field condition, which could be well fitted by quadratic function. We thus established an improved model of N-opd = 2 A/(alpha + 1), where A referred to the symmetrical axis of biomass density quadratic function and remained relatively stable regardless of soil moisture. Since the alpha became significantly greater under the rain-fed condition (P < 0.05), the N-opd was lowered by drought stress. Our findings highlighted a critical role of the plastic allometric relations to affect the N-opd dynamics, suggesting that lower seeding density would be more favorable for field production of wheats in dry environment.

The impact of no-till crop rotation on dryland soil properties and crop yields	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Information on the effect of no-till crop rotation on a broad range of soil properties and long-term crop yields is needed to evaluate its benefits on ecosystem services compared with monocropping. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of no-till crop rotation (barley [Hordeum vulgare L.]/spring wheat [Triticum aestivum L.]-pea [Pisum sativum L.]) and monocropping [continuous barley/spring wheat] on 66 dryland soil physical, chemical, biological, and biochemical properties and long-term crop yields at two dryland farm sites (14- and 36-yr old) in the northern Great Plains. Soil samples collected to a depth of 15 cm in April 2019 were analyzed for soil properties and crop yields determined. At the long-term site, crop rotation increased 11 properties, but reduced 16 of 66 soil properties compared with monocropping. At the short-time site, crop rotation increased 6 properties, but reduced 13 of 66 soil properties compared with monocropping. Longer duration experiments showed more differences in soil properties due to crop rotation than shorter duration experiments. Spring wheat and barley yields were greater following pea than following spring wheat or barley during years with normal or above-average precipitation at both sites. Pea yield in the crop rotation was also greater during these years. Barley/spring wheat-pea rotation can enhance some soil properties and dryland crop yields compared with continuous barley/spring wheat during wet years in the semiarid region of the northern Great Plains.

However, we might overlook the accumulating genetic variation in those dryland micro-populations, which should eventually increase the dryland biodiversity. In the xeric steppes of western and northwestern China, there are two soil surface-dwelling and genetically close cyanobacterial species,Nostoc communeandNostoc flagelliforme. They respectively exhibit lamellate and filamentous colony shapes. Their individual colony is consisted of hundreds of trichomes and the common exopolysaccharide matrix. N. flagelliformeis exclusively distributed in the dryland and supposed to be evolved fromN. commune.We previously reported that the morphological diversity ofN. flagelliformecolonies was very limited, being either cylindrical or strip-like. In this communication, we performed single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of the marker genewspAas well as phylogenetic analysis of the WspA protein inN. flagelliformecolonies to gain insights into its genetic diversity. SNP analysis suggested that there existed plentiful nucleotide variations in the individual colonies and meanwhile these variations shared certain evolutionary regularity. Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced proteins from the clonedwspAsequences suggested that the relatively regular variations were possibly dispersed in theN. flagelliformepopulations of different regions. Thus, these results presented a scenario of the underestimated genetic diversity hidden behind the limited morphotype of dryland cyanobacteria. Maybe, we can consider the individual cyanobacterial colony as a potential biodiversity pool in the drylands.

Louis; Bordovsky, James P.; Brauer, David K.; Lascano, Robert J.; Gitz, Dennis C., III			Simulated Dryland Cotton Yield Response to Selected Scenario Factors Associated With Soil Health	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS												In the Texas High Plains (THP), diminishing irrigation well-capacities, and increasing costs of energy and equipment associated with groundwater extraction and application are contributing factors to a transition from irrigated to dryland agriculture. The primary goal of this modeling exercise was to investigate whether and to what extent hypothetical changes in factors putatively associated with soil health would affect dryland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) yields. The factors selected were drainage, surface runoff, soil water holding capacity, soil organic carbon (SOC) and albedo. As a first analysis to evaluate these factors, we used the CROPGRO-Cotton module within the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) cropping system model. Specifically, we evaluated the effects of reduced surface runoff, increased soil water holding capacity, and SOC, doubling of the soil albedo through stubble mulching, and of soil drainage by enhancing infiltration with no-tillage/cover crops on yield by adjusting related soil properties. In our analysis, we used mean yields simulated with soil properties of a Pullman clay loam soil at Halfway, TX on the THP as baseline, which were compared to values obtained with the adjusted factors using weather data from 2005 to 2019. Simulated mean yield increased by 27% when the soil water holding capacity was increased by 25 mm, 7% when the runoff curve number was decreased from 73 to 60, 16% when soil albedo was increased from 0.2 to 0.4, and by 58% when the soil drainage factor (fraction day(-1)) was doubled from 0.2. No significant statistical change in simulated mean yield was calculated when SOC was increased by 1%. Further, effects of a 50 mm pre-plant irrigation were also assessed, simulating limited irrigation in the transition to dryland agriculture that resulted in a statistically insignificant 12% increase in seed-cotton yield. Simultaneous implementation of the four statistically significant individual scenarios (increased water holding capacity, infiltration, albedo, and drainage) resulted in the highest increase (93%) in mean seed-cotton yield. An economic and risk analysis of simulated yields under different scenarios indicated that these factors could reduce revenue risk for dryland cotton producers, with most of the effect from soil drainage improvements.

The results showed that plastic film mulching during the fallow period increased evapotranspiration (ET) and wheat yield but had little influence on water use efficiency (WUE) and the yield gap. Compared with no tillage (NT), deep ploughing (DP) increased wheat yield without influencing ET and thus increased WUE. Subsoiling had little influence on the average yield, but it increased the possibility of obtaining a high yield. Compared with drill sowing (DS), drill sowing on plastic film (DSM) increased wheat yield with an increase in ET. DSM also reduced the yield gap to some extent. Appropriate fertilizer application rates are also important for reducing yield gaps. When the yield gap was the lowest, the respective nitrogen and phosphate application rates were 150 ha(-1) and 180 ha(-1), respectively. In conclusion, yield gap analysis based on boundary line analysis makes it possible to evaluate how effectively water is used. This case study on the Loess Plateau showed that plastic film mulch and drill sowing on the edges of plastic film (P-DS) increased wheat yield but had little impact on the yield gap and WUE. Deep ploughing increased wheat yield and WUE and reduced the yield gap. Subsoiling (SS) had little impact on yield and WUE, but it increased the possibility of obtaining a higher yield and reduced the yield gap. Moreover, SS is a more effective technique in wet years than in dry years.

Here, we explored the spatiotemporal variability of dryland vegetation phenology using satellite-observed Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) along the North Australian Tropical Transect (NATT). Substantial impacts of extreme drought and intense wetness on the phenology and productivity of dryland vegetation are observed by both SIF and EVI, especially in the arid/semiarid interior of Australia without detectable seasonality in the dry year of 2018-2019. The greenness-based vegetation index (EVI) can more accurately capture the seasonal and interannual variation in vegetation production than SIF (EVI r(2): 0.47 similar to 0.86, SIF r(2): 0.47 similar to 0.78). However, during the brown-down periods, the rate of decline in EVI is evidently slower than that in SIF and in situ measurement of gross primary productivity (GPP), due partially to the advanced seasonality of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation. Over 70% of the variability of EVI (except for Hummock grasslands) and 40% of the variability of SIF (except for shrublands) can be explained by the water-related drivers (rainfall and soil moisture). By contrast, air temperature contributed to 25 similar to 40% of the variability of the effective fluorescence yield (SIFyield) across all biomes. In spite of high retrieval noises and variable accuracy in phenological metrics (MAE: 8 similar to 60 days), spaceborne SIF observations, offsetting the drawbacks of greenness-based phenology products with a potentially lagged end of the season, have the promising capability of mapping and characterizing the spatiotemporal dynamics of dryland vegetation phenology.

In the present study, we investigate the impact of climatic change on dryland wheat yield in the northwest of Iran for the future time horizon of 2041-2070. The Just and Pope production function is applied to assess the impact of climate change on dryland wheat yield and yield risk for the period of 1991-2016. The Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM) is used to generate climate parameters from General Circulation Model (GCM) outputs. The results show that minimum temperature is negatively related to average yield in the linear model while the relationship is positive in the non-linear model. An increase in precipitation increases the mean yield in either model. The maximum temperature has a positive effect on the mean yield in the linear model, while this impact is negative in the non-linear model. Drought has an adverse impact on yield levels in both models. The results also indicate that maximum temperature, precipitation, and drought are positively related to yield variability, but minimum temperature is negatively associated with yield variability. The findings also reveal that yield variability is expected to increase in response to future climate scenarios. Given these impacts of temperature on rain-fed wheat crop and its increasing vulnerability to climatic change, policy-makers should support research into and development of wheat varieties that are resistant to temperature variations.

Effects of crack morphology on soil carbon flux dynamics in a dryland vertisol	GEODERMA												CO2 flux in dryland ecosystems is typically limited by soil carbon release, resulting in pulses of flux with precipitation and transitions between low and high moisture. Soil crack morphology, which shifts distinctly between these wet and dry periods, can introduce additional complexity to the magnitude and dynamics of CO2 flux, though its full effects remain unknown. In this study, we combine analyses of minute-scale temperature profile fluctuations in a model soil fracture with CO2 flux measurements in Kenyan vertisols with known differences in crack morphology. We show that flux enhancements due to crack morphology are due to thermal convection and are driven by depth and aperture. Combined with elevated levels of carbon in the soil, fluxes can consistently increase several orders of magnitude. However, limitations imposed on either axis of soil mechanics or soil carbon release modulate the magnitude of CO2 flux and increase variability. Our results provide a stronger integration of the role that soil structure plays on dryland CO2 flux dynamics.

Anne			Native and Dryland Pasture Seed Mixes Impact Revegetation 12 Years after Pipeline Construction in Southern Alberta	LAND												Activities associated with agriculture, grazing, and the energy industry have altered large tracts of native rangeland in North America. Pipelining causes intense local disturbance by removal of vegetation and alterations to soil horizons. Following a disturbance, reclamation is required to return the land to equivalent land capability. Revegetation is usually by seeding native and/or agronomic (non-native, dominant) species. This study investigated the long-term effects of native and dryland pasture (91% non-native species) seed mixes, grazing, and right-of-way (RoW) treatments on revegetation of native rangeland in southeastern Alberta. Native seed mixes were more successful at enhancing seeded vegetation cover than dryland pasture seed mixes. Grazing had a significant impact only on the survival of non-native grasses. The seed mix did not significantly affect total, native, non-native, annual, or perennial forb cover. Total forb cover was significantly higher on the trench with the dryland pasture seed mix than all other RoW treatments (storage, work). This long-term study suggests that native seed mixes can result in successful revegetation of reclamation following pipeline construction.

Here, we conducted a comprehensive, continental-scale survey of soil archaeal communities in adjacent pairs of maize (dryland) and rice (wetland) fields in eastern China.ResultsWe revealed the consequential roles of environmental filtering in driving archaeal community assembly for both maize and rice fields. Rice fields, abundant with Euryarchaeota, had higher archaeal diversity and steeper distance-decay slopes than maize fields dominated by Thaumarchaeota. Dominant soil archaea showed distinct continental atlases and niche differentiation between dryland and wetland habitats, where they were associated with soil pH and mean annual temperature, respectively. After identifying their environmental preferences, we grouped the dominant archaeal taxa into different ecological clusters and determined the unique co-occurrence patterns within each cluster. Using this empirical dataset, we built a continental atlas of soil archaeal communities to provide reliable estimates of their spatial distributions in agricultural ecosystems.ConclusionsEnvironmental filtering plays a crucial role in driving the distinct continental atlases of dominant soil archaeal communities between dryland and wetland, with contrasting strategies of archaeal-driven nutrient cycling within these two agricultural ecosystems. These findings improve our ability to predict how soil archaeal communities respond to environmental changes and to manage soil archaeal communities for provisioning of agricultural ecosystem services.

The present study was conducted with the aim of evaluating the status of environmental indicators of the dryland and irrigated wheat production systems. The required information was obtained from 100 wheat production farms through questionnaire method. After calculating the input and outputs, environmental indicators were calculated by life cycle assessment method. A novel index as "input to total output" was formulated to evaluate the efficiency of using/consuming each input in production systems. In average, the values of input to total output index for all inputs in dryland wheat production system were 1.45 times higher than those of the irrigated system. In average, the environmental indicators of the dryland wheat production systems had 1.85 times higher values than those of the irrigated systems. Marine water ecotoxicity was the indicator with highest value for both production systems as 12.33 x 104 and 8.22 x 104 kg 1.4 DB eq and the indicator with lowest value was ozone layer depletion as 3.54 x 10-5 and 1.90 x 10-5 kg CFC-11 eq for dryland and irrigated wheat production systems, respectively. In both production systems, nitrogen had the greeted share in all environmental indicators from 15 to 80 %, except for eutrophication and acidifi-cation potential which were mostly affected by emissions of wheat farms.

However, climate change is causing more frequent and severe drought events, accompanied by warmer temperatures, collectively threatening the persistence of these groundwater dependent ecosystems through a combination of increasing evaporative demand and decreasing groundwater supply. We conducted a dendro-isotopic analysis of radial growth and seasonal (semi-annual) carbon isotope discrimination (Delta C-13) to investigate the response of riparian cottonwood stands to the unprecedented California-wide drought from 2012 to 2019, along the largest remaining free-flowing river in Southern California. Our goals were to identify principal drivers and indicators of drought stress for dryland riparian woodlands, determine their thresholds of tolerance to hydroclimatic stressors, and ultimately assess their vulnerability to climate change. Riparian trees were highly responsive to drought conditions along the river, exhibiting suppressed growth and strong stomatal closure (inferred from reduced Delta C-13) during peak drought years. However, patterns of radial growth and Delta C-13 were quite variable among sites that differed in climatic conditions and rate of groundwater decline. We show that the rate of groundwater decline, as opposed to climate factors, was the primary driver of site differences in drought stress, and trees showed greater sensitivity to temperature at sites subjected to faster groundwater decline. Across sites, higher correlation between radial growth and Delta C-13 for individual trees, and higher inter-correlation of Delta C-13 among trees were indicative of greater drought stress. Trees showed a threshold of tolerance to groundwater decline at 0.5 m year(-1) beyond which drought stress became increasingly evident and severe. For sites that exceeded this threshold, peak physiological stress occurred when total groundwater recession exceeded similar to 3 m. These findings indicate that drought-induced groundwater decline associated with more extreme droughts is a primary threat to dryland riparian woodlands and increases their susceptibility to projected warmer temperatures.					; Drake, John/N-8490-2014	Roberts, Dar/0000-0002-3555-4842; Pelletier, Lissa/0000-0003-4122-7706; Williams, Jared/0000-0002-0383-6650; Voelker, Steven/0000-0002-0110-3381; Stella, John/0000-0001-6095-7726; Singer, Michael/0000-0002-6899-2224; Drake, John/0000-0001-9453-1766; LAMBERT, Adam/0000-0001-7035-1787													1354-1013	1365-2486				NOV	2022	28	22					6771	6788		10.1111/gcb.16376	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.16376		AUG 2022						36045489					WOS:000847930100001

The Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX) model was used to simulate ET using four potential ET (ETp) methods. The objectives were to determine sensitive ET parameters in dryland and irrigated cropping systems and compare ET simulation in the two systems using multiple performance criteria. Measured ET and crop yield data from lysimeter fields located in the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service Bushland, Texas were used for evaluation. The number of sensitive parameters was higher for dryland (11-14) than irrigated cropping systems (6-8). Only four input parameters: soil evaporation plant cover factor, root growth soil strength, maximum rain intercept, and rain intercept coefficient were sensitive in both cropping systems. Overall, it is possible to find a set of robust parameter values to simulate ET accurately in APEX in both cropping systems using any ETp method. However, more computation time is required for dryland than irrigated cropping system due to a relatively larger number of sensitive input parameters. When all inputs are available, the Penman-Monteith method takes the shortest computation time to obtain one model run with robust parameter values in both cropping systems. However, in areas with limited datasets, one can still obtain reasonable ET simulations using either Priestley-Taylor or Hargreaves.

While community resilience in socio-ecological systems is largely determined by access to and sustainable management of natural resources, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. This study, which uses grounded theory integrated with discourse analysis, aims to contribute addressing this knowledge gap. First, we explore global literature describing trends and patterns in the various stressors-including climate change, frequent drought, and famine, ecological, socio-economic, and institutional stressors-that impact the livelihood resilience of these communities, with the goal of summarizing how multiple stressors impact the sustainability of dryland social-ecological systems. Then, using the sustainable development goals (SDGs) as a reference target, we propose potential entry points to support livelihood resilience pathways. These include land, water, livestock and agroforestry, and institutional and social capital. Lastly, we suggest an integrated multi-scalar pathway embedded with cross-sectorial policies and differential cross-social strategies towards combining resilience with SDGs targets. This research can help stakeholders to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of various stressors, ultimately strengthening livelihood resilience in dryland ecosystems.																			1085-3278	1099-145X				2023 OCT 30	2023										10.1002/ldr.4964	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4964		OCT 2023											WOS:001093768100001

Foliar application of nutrients is an effective strategy to increase grain yield in dryland conditions. This experiment was carried out in a randomized complete block design with six treatments (a control, foliar application of urea 4%, zinc sulfate 0.3%, humic acid 0.1%, potassium chloride 2%, and vitaspirin 0.1%) and three replications on dryland wheat. Nutrients were sprayed in stem elongation and heading stages. In the cropping seasons of 2017-2018 and 2018-2019, the foliar application of urea, humic acid, and vitaspirin significantly improved grain yield; however, in the cropping season of 2019-2020, the foliar application had no significant effect on boosting grain yield. The cropping season of 2018-2019 showed the highest increase in grain yield as a result of the foliar application of different compounds, whereas the cropping season of 2019-2020 saw the lowest increase. Lower autumn and winter temperature and less rainfall are probably to blame for the diminished effect of foliar application on grain yield in the 2019-2020 cropping season. Also, in each of the three cropping seasons, the control had the lowest grain yield. The results show that foliar application of nutrients increases grain yield in dryland conditions and that foliar treatment's effects on growth and grain yield diminish when rainfall drops in dryland conditions.																			0367-4223	1439-0345				2023 MAY 31	2023										10.1007/s10343-023-00892-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10343-023-00892-7		MAY 2023											WOS:000999181100001

However, groundwater resources are finite, and depletion can make continued irrigation inviable. When modeling the economic impacts of future aquifer decline, studies often assume that irrigated cropland will transition uniformly to dryland crop production. In reality, irrigation has allowed crops to be grown across a wider range of soil and climate conditions than can support dryland crop production. Here, we test the agronomic and economic importance of this assumption by mapping the spatiotemporal distribution of anticipated future irrigation losses across the Ogallala or High Plains Aquifer (USA) at annual, 30 m resolution. We then develop a land use suitability model to determine whether these lands would transition to dryland agriculture or pasture use. We find that 22,000 km(2) (24 %) of currently irrigated lands in the High Plains Aquifer may be unable to support irrigated agriculture by 2100, and 13 % of these areas are not suitable for dryland crop production due primarily to low quality soils. To quantify the farm-scale and regional-scale economic importance of land use suitability, we selected six case study counties across the aquifer and modeled farm and community-scale economic outcomes (gross revenue and value added, respectively) with and without consideration of land use suitability. We find that not accounting for land use suitability leads to an overestimate of economic benefits in transitioned land by 12-45 %, with variability across counties primarily driven by the distribution of soil capability, dryland crop mix, and local economic factors. Notably, this implies that the economic impacts of land transitions are not directly proportional to area lost but rather mediated by underlying variability in these three factors. Our analyses highlight the importance of considering local biophysical constraints in planning for future land use trajectories. Community and regional land use planning needs to incorporate the possibility that irrigated cropland may transition to non-irrigated pasture production rather than dryland crop production, which can have substantial biophysical and economic impacts.

Soil water extractable organic matter under long-term dryland cropping systems on the Texas High Plains	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Water extractable organic matter (WEOM) is critical for soil fertility because of its role as a readily available C substrate for microbial metabolism. In the semi-arid Texas High Plains, dryland cropping systems are common because of limited precipitation and irrigation water. Little is known about the long-term effects of dryland cropping on soil WEOM content and composition, and how these differ from native grassland. The objective of this study was to use soils collected near Amarillo, TX, in 1977 and 2013 to examine the long-term (72 yr total cropping length) effects of dryland cropping systems [continuous wheat and wheat-fallow rotations] and tillage methods (disk plow, stubble-mulch tillage, and delayed stubble-mulch tillage) on WEOM characteristics, compared with native grassland. In cropped plots, water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC) concentrations, a measure of WEOM content, were depleted regardless of tillage or crop, with reductions up to 13% in 1977 and 60% in 2013, compared with native grassland in 2013. Other parameters of WEOM changed over time, where cropped soils from 2013 had proportionally more WEOM in aromatic, phenolic, and lignin-like forms, attributed to recently incorporated crop residues. In contrast, WEOM in cropped soils from 1977 and native grassland (2013) contained more functional groups (e.g., aliphatic, aromatic, polysaccharide, phenol, etc.) and humic-like substances than cropped soils in 2013. This suggests that long-term dryland cropping led to depletion of stable, humic-like WEOM. Enhancement of WEOM stocks and long-term sustainability in the Texas High Plains may require more vigorous conservation systems than currently used.

This study examined the effects of multi-intensity summer pruning on water balance, production and water use efficiency of apple orchards on China's Loess Plateau using in situ measurements and the process-based MAESPA model. A field experiment with four intensities representing no (0% or control), light (10%), moderate (25%) and heavy (40%) pruning of branches was carried out in three replicates under each treatment. The pruning intensities dictated transpiration, soil moisture and drainage. Although light pruning had weak impacts on these factors, moderate and heavy pruning significantly reduced growing-season transpiration by an average 10.4% and 28.5%, respectively. However, the effects progressively faded away with time at both diurnal and seasonal scales. Moderate and heavy pruning also increased soil water content in the 20-180 cm by an average 18.3% and 20.8%, respectively, and thus enhanced drainage below 180 cm (>220 mm), relative to light pruning and control (<170 mm). Furthermore, light and moderate pruning clearly promoted apple yield and water use efficiency whereas heavy pruning significantly reduced (24.7%) apple yield. Thus, moderate pruning can be a good choice for apple orchards in normal precipitation years while heavy pruning may be an alternative in severe drought years. The MAESPA model reliably simulated seasonal variations of transpiration (R-2: 0.799-0.910, root mean square error (RMSE): 0.111-0.207 mm), soil evaporation (R-2: 0.368-0.628, RMSE: 0.468-1.076 mm), and profile soil water content (R-2: 0.400-0.894, RMSE: 0.005-0.024 cm(3) cm(-3)) for all treatments and can be used as a tool to quantify the effects of pruning on hydrological processes in dryland apple orchards. This study provides insights into the development of a sustainable management strategy in dryland orchards.

J	Zúñiga, F; Jaime, M; Salazar, C				Zuniga, Felipe; Jaime, Marcela; Salazar, Cesar			Crop farming adaptation to droughts in small-scale dryland agriculture in Chile	WATER RESOURCES AND ECONOMICS												Small-scale agriculture is one of the fundamental economic sectors in Chile. An increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events due to climate change suggest a higher weather risk for the future, with potential consequences for crop choices. These effects are expected to be greater in dryland areas, where producers are more vulnerable to shocks and, therefore, less able to protect themselves against these risks. Using data from the 7th Chilean National Agriculture and Forestry Census, we explore small-scale farmers' cropland decisions as an adaptation strategy to cope with droughts. We use remote sensing data to identify drought events and model the impact of droughts on farmers' decisions using a multivariate fractional model. This model assumes that farmers allocate shares of land over a crop portfolio. Our findings show that farmers in dryland areas reduce high-risk cropping activities after recent drought shocks, choosing crops with shorter growing periods and lower capital and technological costs, such as cereals. However, we found a different cropland pattern in areas with a higher frequency of droughts. In these locations, farmers prefer legumes and tubers, vineyards, fruits and vegetables. Finally, maize and vineyards are more likely to be grown in places with higher temperatures. Results suggest potential crop adaptation strategies in the face of more arid environments in the future.

Here we clarify how dryland species vary in their functional traits across environmental gradients.Methods We measured nine traits reflecting resource use for 68 species inhabiting dryland steppe communities across northwestern China. We tested predictions from various theoretical frameworks including the leaf economics spectrum, leaf energy balance theory and least-cost optimality theory.Results Species on drier or sunnier sites had smaller leaves with higher LMA, higher leaf nitrogen concentration per area (Narea), and a greater drawdown of CO2 during photosynthesis (i.e., lower Ci:Ca) suggesting higher photosynthetic water use efficiency. Leaf nitrogen per mass and plant height (typically < 1.4 m for all species) did not vary with climate or with soil properties. Trait-trait relationships showed little patterning in relation to climate or soil. Traits of forbs were more strongly influenced by environmental properties than those of the shrubs, trees, or grasses sampled.Conclusion We investigated variation in plant traits that influence carbon economy, water use and competitive interactions, and found that in dry and low fertility environments, dryland steppe species exhibited a mixture of resource acquisitive (e.g. high Narea) and conservative leaf traits (e.g. high LMA). Our results demonstrate the utility of applying multiple theoretical frameworks to better understand variation in resource use strategies among co-occurring species.

Decomposition of dryland biocrust-forming lichens and mosses contributes to soil nutrient cycling	PLANT AND SOIL												Background and aims Biocrusts are major contributors to dryland nutrient cycling by regulating C, N and P inputs and fluxes. However, our understanding about how the decomposition of biocrust constituents contributes to soil nutrient cycling in drylands is virtually unknown. Methods We conducted a microcosm experiment to: i) evaluate the litter decomposition dynamics of two common biocrust-forming species with contrasting tissue chemistry and growth form (the lichen Cladonia foliacea and the moss Syntrichia caninervis), and ii) their effects on several soil variables related to soil functioning. Results Cladonia litter decomposed gradually with time (92% total mass loss after 342 days), while Syntrichia litter decomposed much faster (92% total mass loss after 62 days, with no further losses until the end of the experiment at 342 days). We observed species-specific effects of their litter on dissolved organic N (DON) and NH4+ depending on collection time, which changed the effects of litter decomposition on DON and pH regardless of the biocrust species considered. Overall, biocrust litter had a positive effect on SOC, DON, NH4 and acid phosphatase activity. Conclusions Our experimental results show that decomposition of biocrust tissues plays an important role in soil nutrient cycling, indicating that this process impacts the fertility and functioning of dryland soils.

However, knowledge of such factors, how they vary across landscapes, or whether they reflect more fundamental causes of (dis) connection from nature is still scarce. In this study, we focused on Spanish drylands, which are frequently undervalued by the local population and impacted by land degradation processes but provide important contributions to sustaining human well-being. We developed a methodological approach for understanding humannature connectedness across ten representative landscapes of Spanish drylands. We carried out 191 face-to-face surveys to assess how people prefer different landscapes and identify which type of nature's value explain landscape preferences. The findings showed that specific landscapes were preferred differently by the public these preferences were supported by diverse values of nature. For instance, greenhouses were chosen as nonpreferred landscape by locals, while protected littoral and desert were identified as the most preferred landscapes. Instrumental value was mainly assigned to greenhouses mostly based on the economic profits they provide, while other preferred landscapes such as traditional agricultural and high mountains were mostly related to relational value. Results show how the understanding of human-landscape connections can help to guide future conservation efforts as well as to foster conservation behavior.

Seasonal Patterns of Root Production with Water and Nitrogen Additions Across Three Dryland Ecosystems	ECOSYSTEMS												Root production is known to contribute at least 50% of total net primary production in dryland ecosystems, yet few studies have addressed seasonal dynamics of root production or the belowground response to altered resource availability. We aimed to identify how root production varies across three dryland ecosystems dominated by different plant functional types: the shortgrass steppe, dominated by C-4 perennial bunchgrasses, the northern mixed-grass prairie, co-dominated by perennial C-3 and C-4 grasses, and the sagebrush steppe, dominated by a perennial shrub with an understory of C-3 and C-4 grasses and forbs. We also sought to determine how root production changes throughout a growing season for these three systems, and how it responds to increased water and nitrogen availability. We used root ingrowth cores to monitor root production in 6-week intervals between June 1 and October 5, 2017, and with water and nitrogen additions in shortgrass steppe, mixed-grass prairie, and sagebrush steppe in the western Great Plains of the United States. We found that the northern mixed-grass prairie had the highest total root production during our sampling period, and that seasonal patterns of root growth varied significantly across the dryland types, with root growth greatest during the middle of the growing season at the sagebrush steppe and greatest during the end of the growing season at the northern mixed-grass prairie. As expected, belowground root production was about half aboveground production in all sites. Root production responded less to water and nitrogen addition than did aboveground production.

Seedling root growth experiments for two Australian dryland riparian eucalypts provide new insights for environmental watering	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												In dryland environments where rivers have been modified by water resource developments, the use of environmental water provides a management tool to restore or maintain riparian vegetation conditions. Relevant management actions include watering to promote the recruitment of highly valued woody species. However, for many riparian trees, little is known about the watering regimes needed to achieve successful recruitment. We conducted a glasshouse experiment to investigate the early growth of 5-week old seedlings of two Australian dryland riparian tree species, coolibah (Eucalyptus coolabah) and river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis), in floodplain soil cores to provide insights into their requirements for successful establishment in dryland habitats. Both species exhibited similar growth patterns for their above-ground components. E. coolabah root penetration through soil cores was consistent over the 12-week experiment. In contrast, E. camaldulensis root penetration appeared to be considerably slower during the first 6 weeks, but then became more rapid over the following 6 weeks, with similar rooting depths after 12 weeks observed to those of E. coolabah. These findings suggest that coolibah seedlings are more likely to establish under rapidly drying conditions than river red gum seedlings. Such differences in early growth for these iconic species should be considered when determining the provision of environmental water for their management.																			1535-1459	1535-1467				DEC	2021	37	10					1463	1470		10.1002/rra.3853	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.3853		SEP 2021											WOS:000692422500001

EFFECT OF SEEDING RATE ON SOIL WATER CONSUMPTION, YIELD AND QUALITY UNDER WIDE SPACE SOWING OF DRYLAND WINTER WHEAT ON THE LOESS PLATEAU IN CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												A field experiments was conducted at the Wenxi experimental site of Shanxi Agriculture University, China A study was designed to evaluate the effect of different planting density and tillage conditions, spike, protein content, protein yield and grain yield of dryland wheat cultivar (Liangxing-99). The five doses of nitrogen application included were the following: 150 kg.hm(-2), 225 kg.hm(-2), 300 kg.hm(-2), 375 kg.hm(-2), and 450 kg.hm(-2). The nitrogen rate/amount has extremely significant effects on the number of ears, thousand-grain weight and yield and water use efficiency of winter wheat. Nitrogen absorption and fertilizer productive efficiency significantly were increase by 50 % and 51 %, respectively, while nitrogen harvest index, the number of ears and yield significantly increased by 22 %, 46% and the yield by 25%, 55%. The water use efficiency significantly increased by 33 %. The treatment significantly improved grain albumin 13 %, gliadin 14 %, gluten protein 17 %, total protein 14 %, and grain/alcohol ratio 3 %; wet gluten content increased by 23 %, water absorption by 14 % and, the softening degree was reduced. Improving nitrogen uptake at different growing stages, ultimately increased yield and improved quality. GS activity of flag leaf was closely related with the total grain protein, glutenin, and gliadin content at the middle filling stage. Wide space sowing in Jinnan area was beneficial and increased water consumption during the growth period, also tiller dynamics, promoted nutrient operation, and increased yield and grain protein content.

Both satellite SIF data sets are more sensitive to water and heat stress than is the greenness-based vegetation index (enhanced vegetation index). Moreover, the OCO-2 SIF observations show a more significant reduction and earlier response to the heat stress than does GOME-2 SIF, indicating that the two satellite SIF data sets differ in how they monitor the drought and heat wave event due to the different timing of observations. Eddy covariance measurements confirm the different responses of dryland vegetation to the 2019 heat wave at a subdaily time scale. The differences in the timing of the satellite SIF products can be used to assess different elements of the impact of heat and water stress on Australian dryland ecosystems. Plain Language Summary An extreme heat wave occurred across Australia during the summer of 2019, and the high air temperatures and low precipitation affected the vegetation. We used two satellite solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data sets to investigate the response of vegetation growth to the extremely high temperatures in Australia. Vegetation growth was reduced during the 2019 summer, but SIF measurements allowed us to separate the impact of the heat wave on the vegetation in the morning and in the afternoon. Our work illustrates how the timing of satellite observations provides different information on how dryland vegetation responds to heat waves in Australia.

This study describes the richness and density of benthic macroinvertebrates in temporary pools across different sections of a dryland intermittent river catchment and characterizes the diversity partitioning at different spatial scales across the longitudinal gradient of the river. We hypothesized that the diversity of invertebrates is not homogeneously distributed among the different spatial scales but concentrated at the finer levels of pools and river reaches. The study was conducted in an intermittent river catchment in semiarid Brazil. Sampling was performed hierarchically, including 3 segments of the river (upper, middle, and a tributary), 3 reaches per segment, 3 sites per reach, and 3 microhabitats per site (n = 81). Macroinvertebrate diversity was evaluated at scales of river segment (beta 4), reach (beta 3), site (beta 2), and microhabitat (beta 1). Habitat structure was composed of a diverse array of elements that varied spatially. Scale-dependent spatial segregation of community composition was observed on macroinvertebrate assemblages. Diversity partitioning analysis reinforced the importance of broader spatial scales (beta 4) and lesser importance of finer spatial scales (beta 1 and beta 2) for the regional diversity in the dryland river catchment study site. Our observations reflect a combination of homogenization of assemblage composition and reduced diversity at finer scales, with a greater contribution of broader scales to the diversity.

However, the impact investigation is currently limited to the analysis of meteorological data, and there is a dearth of long-term monitoring of crop phenology and soil moisture associated with climate change. In this study, temperature and precipitation (1957-2020) were recorded, crop growth (1981-2019) data were collected, and field experiments were conducted at central and eastern Gansu and southern Ningxia, China. The mean temperature increased by 0.36 & DEG;C, and precipitation decreased by 11.17 mm per decade. The average evapotranspiration (ET) of winter wheat in 39 years from 1981 to 2019 was 362.1 mm, demonstrating a 22.1-mm decrease every 10 years. However, the ET of spring maize was 405.5 mm over 35 years (1985-2019), which did not show a downward trend. Every 10 years, growth periods were shortened by 5.19 and 6.47 d, sowing dates were delayed by 3.56 and 1.68 d, and maturity dates advanced by 1.76 and 5.51 d, respectively, for wheat and maize. A film fully-mulched ridge-furrow (FMRF) system with a rain-harvesting efficiency of 65.7-92.7% promotes deep rainwater infiltration into the soil. This leads to double the soil moisture in-furrow, increasing the water satisfaction rate by 110-160%. A 15-year grain yield of maize increased by 19.87% with the FMRF compared with that of half-mulched flat planting. Grain yield and water use efficiency of maize increased by 20.6 and 17.4% when the density grew from 4.5x104 to 6.75x104 plants ha-1 and improved by 12.0 and 12.7% when the density increased from 6.75x104 to 9.0x104 plants ha-1, respectively. Moreover, responses of maize yield to density and the corresponding density of the maximum yield varied highly in different rainfall areas. The density parameter suitable for water planting was 174 maize plants ha-1 with 10 mm rainfall. Therefore, management strategies should focus on adjusting crop planting structure, FMRF water harvesting system, and water-suitable planting to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change and enhance sustainable production of maize in the drylands.																			2095-3119	2352-3425				JUL	2023	22	7					2067	2079		10.1016/j.jia.2022.08.044	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jia.2022.08.044		JUL 2023											WOS:001047075400001

Using artificial neural networks to predict future dryland responses to human and climate disturbances	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Land degradation and sediment remobilisation in dryland environments is considered to be a significant global environmental problem. Given the potential for currently stabilised dune systems to reactivate under climate change and increased anthropogenic pressures, identifying the role of external disturbances in driving geomorphic response is vitally important. We developed a novel approach, using artificial neural networks (ANNs) applied to time series of historical reactivation-deposition events from the Nebraska Sandhills, to determine the relationship between historic periods of sand deposition in semi-arid grasslands and external climatic conditions, land use pressures and wildfire occurrence. We show that both vegetation growth and sediment re-deposition episodes can be accurately estimated. Sensitivity testing of individual factors shows that localised forcings (overgrazing and wildfire) have a statistically significant impact when the climate is held at present-day conditions. However, the dominant effect is climate-induced drought. Our approach has great potential for estimating future landscape sensitivity to climate and land use scenarios across a wide range of potentially fragile dryland environments.

This paper presents an overview of changing human-river relations, knowledges and practices in the management of dryland rivers in western India over the last 4500 years. In ancient times, traditional knowledges underpinned local water harvesting techniques that worked with nature. Subsequent imposition of external values and knowledge frameworks in colonial times applied a command-and-control ethos that asserted human authority over rivers. Postindependence, development programmes in the second half of the 21st century further accentuated this legacy, with profound implications for river health. Discipline-bound approaches to river restoration in recent decades have failed to address these concerns. Using the Sabarmati catchment (similar to 20,000 km(2)) as a case study, we develop a holistic, transdisciplinary approach that integrates traditional place-based knowledges and practices alongside scientific understandings and the generative potential of Big Data to show how a plural knowledges model can support proactive and precautionary approaches to sustainable river management.

Measurements of water level and flow rate were performed and analysed together with secondary data on hydrogeology, water use and satellite images. Average transmission losses ranged from about 12 to 28% of the river inflow, while transmission gains ranged from 10 to 34%. Transmission losses occurred at the beginning of the rainy season (rainfall <= 10 mm/d), while the transmission gains were preponderant after intense rainfall events (> 20 mm/d). A direct relationship between the transmission losses/gains and river inflow was also observed. Linear equations were adjusted to estimate the order of magnitude of transmission losses (R-2 > 0.85) and gains (R-2 > 0.60). The transmission loss equation was validated for rivers in similar regions (R-2 approximate to 0.85).

Inter-decadal variation in diadromous and potamodromous fish assemblages in a near pristine tropical dryland river	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Freshwater ecosystems are both incredibly biodiverse and highly threatened globally. Variation in environmental parameters including habitat and flow can substantially affect many ecological processes within riverine aquatic communities, but the ties between such parameters and ecology are neither well studied nor understood. In highly variable tropical dryland river systems, assessing such relationships requires data collection over inter-decadal time scales, which is not typically permitted on development schedules driven over short periods (including election and funding cycles). Here, we used seine net sampling data collected over an 18-year period in the tropical dryland Fitzroy River, Western Australia, to assess how environmental and temporal factors including habitat, seasonality, and inter-annual variation in wet season magnitude affect the community assemblage structure, recruitment, and growth of aquatic species in dryland rivers. Results demonstrated that macrohabitat (main channel vs floodplain creek) and the magnitude of wet season rains and resultant flooding both had a substantial influence on biotic communities, alongside seasonal and diel variation. The magnitude of wet season flooding (measured as river discharge volume) had the greatest impact on assemblage composition within floodplain creek habitats and was a significant driver of recruitment rates and growth of recruits and adults of several species examined. This study highlights key considerations for conserving dryland river systems and constituent biota. Specifically, these are maintaining (a) rhythmicity of flow within each year, (b) diversity of flow volume between years, and (c) a variety of habitat types including ephemeral, semi-permanent, and permanent shallow floodplain and deeper main channel pools, in order to support a diverse array of generalist and specialist diadromous and potamodromous fishes.

In recent decades, climate change has threatened the nutrient balance of dryland ecosystems. However, its impact on soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) in drylands of China are still unclear. In this study, the structural equation model (SEM) was used to explain the relationship between environmental variables used by the best model and SOC or STN. Then Adaptive Boosting Regressor (AdaBoost), Gradient Boosting Regression (GBRT), Extreme gradient boosting Regression (XGBoost) and Random Forest Regression (RF) were used to establish the prediction model of SOC and STN based on soil samples along with environmental variables. The performance of these models was assessed based on a 10-fold cross-validation method using three statistical indicators. Finally, we predicted the SOC and STN of soil samples from 2000 to 2019 based on the best model. Overall, the RF model performed better at predicting SOC and STN in drylands than the other three prediction models (AdaBoost, GBRT, XGBoost). Climate factors were the main factors affecting SOC and STN in the study area. In the Alashan, a dryland in northern China, the precipitation in the growing season increased from 2000 to 2019, at a rate of 12.9 mm/decade. During the same period, the annual sunshine duration significantly decreased by 66 h/decade. Along with interannual hydrothermal variability, SOC showed a fluctuating upward trend at a rate of 0.04 g/kg/decade, while STN exhibited a fluctuating downward trend at 0.003 g/kg/decade from 2000 to 2019. Due to the effects of climate change, dryland were considered as potential sites for carbon sequestration. However, due to the annual hydrothermal variance causing dynamic annual changes, it was deemed unstable. Moreover, it would cause STN loss, which might reduce soil fertility. More attention should be paid to STN monitoring in dryland in the future.																			0301-4797	1095-8630				OCT 1	2022	319								115751	10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115751	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115751								35982576					WOS:000855652500004

Unraveling mechanisms underlying effects of wetting-drying cycles on soil respiration in a dryland	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Rewetting of dry soils usually stimulates soil carbon (C) emission, a phenomenon known as the Birch effect. Soil C cycling in drylands, which store approximately one third of terrestrial soil organic C (SOC), is strongly affected by wetting-drying cycles. However, the physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms that link rewetting cycles with dryland soil C cycling have not been comprehensively studied, nor do we understand how these mechanisms interact with each other. Here, we conducted a dryland soil incubation experiment manipulating four factors related to global change (soil moisture content, soil moisture variability, C availability, and prior warming) in a factorial design. The experiment was divided into two periods: a rewetting period consisting of six 14-d wetting-drying cycles; and a recovery period lasting 28 days during which soil moisture content was held stable, allowing for examination of the legacy effects of the wet-dry cycles. Rewetting cycles decreased soil aggregate stability under some conditions, but their effects on soil microbial biomass and fungal communities, soil enzyme activities, soil priming, and soil dissolved C were not significant. We found lower average soil respiration under the wetting-drying treatment than the stable soil moisture treatment, and Birch effects were observed, but only under some conditions. This was probably because moisture variability exacerbated soil microbial metabolic stress, which showed itself as oxygen limitation during the initial precipitation pulse and as water limitation during soil drying. Notably, respiration rates remained low even after moisture fluctuations ceased, suggesting a legacy effect of rewetting cycles on dryland microbial communities. Overall, rewetting inhibited aggregate formation (physical mechanism), and suppressed soil respiration by inducing soil microbial metabolic stress (biological mechanism), ultimately leading to lower soil C loss under rewetting. Our findings indicate that Birch effects are mediated by the magnitude of moisture variability, the availability of C, and the degree of physiological stress microbes experience.

Whereas most such studies focus on large-scale variation in functional traits along a single-factor environmental gradient, the mutual effects of small-scale multiple environmental filtering remain unclear. Furthermore, it has rarely been tested whether the combined effect of aridity and salinity on local dryland vegetation constrains the patterns of functional traits and phylogenetic structures. Across an 8-km long transect in the arid northwest of China, we assessed the role of environmental filtering in shaping community assemblages by testing the hypotheses that aridity and salinity stresses, interspecific competition and phylogenetic structures constrained functional diversity in the local dryland vegetation. Our results showed that aridity significantly increased convergence of themaximum plant height, specific leaf area, leaf area and leaf nitrogen concentration. However, salinity significantly promoted the convergence of only leaf area and leaf nitrogen concentration. In addition, interspecific competition increased the convergence of the maximum plant height and leaf area. Leaf area converged significantly due to phylogenetic history. Aridity filtering, but not salinity filtering, obviously increased the clustering of phylogenetic structure. Interspecific competition and phylogenetic structure hadweak effects on functional diversity in local dryland vegetation. In conclusion, comparedwith salinity filtering, aridity filtering was more important in reducing phylogenetic diversity in dryland vegetation.

Managed honeybee hives and the diversity of wild bees in a dryland nature reserve	APIDOLOGIE												Honeybee hives may influence pollen and nectar availability in natural ecosystems, which may consequently affect wild pollinators. We studied the effects of managed honeybee hives on wild bee diversity in Villavicencio Nature Reserve (Mendoza, Argentina). We placed pan traps at increasing distances from honeybee hives to estimate wild bee abundance, richness, and composition. Wild bee abundance did not change detectably with distance to honeybee hives, although the abundance of the most common species, Arhysosage bifasciata, increased with increasing distance to the hives. Wild bee richness increased weakly with increasing distance to hives. Although wild bee composition did not change significantly with distance to the apiaries for the full data set, it changed significantly when we excluded A. bifasciata from the analyses. We found no relationship between body size and distance to the apiaries. Overall, our results indicate that managed honeybee hives had mixed effects on the wild bee assemblage in our study area. Given the relatively low hive density used in our study compared to other studies, we recommend an adaptive management strategy with continuous impact assessment.

Ethnoarchaeology of Sorghum and Millet Cultivation in Dryland Environments of Sudan, Pakistan, and Ethiopia	ETHNOARCHAEOLOGY												Drylands cover more than 40% of the earth's land surface, are found on all continents, and are home to 30% of the world's population. Due to water scarcity, they are generally considered unsuitable for lasting human settlement. While pastoralism has been reconceptualized recently as a rational, efficient, and sustainable way to live in drylands, agriculture without irrigation is generally considered unfeasible in hyper-arid and arid drylands. This article presents data collected in ethnographic interviews in dryland areas in three countries, Sudan, Pakistan, and Ethiopia, to document and understand the cultivation practices of pearl millet, finger millet, and sorghum in drylands. Contrary to general trends favoring adoption of more water-intensive crops, our results show that farming without irrigation represents a viable strategy even where rainfall is considered insufficient. We argue that it is important to recognize the sustainability and value of dryland agricultural systems, past, present, and future.

J	Whitehead, D				Whitehead, David			Management of Grazed Landscapes to Increase Soil Carbon Stocks in Temperate, Dryland Grasslands	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS												Management of the temperate, grazed grasslands in New Zealand for more than a century has led to swards dominated by ryegrass/clover, which, with inputs of inorganic fertilizers, are highly productive for grazing animals. In the last 20 years the widespread introduction of irrigation to dryland areas on flat land has increased productivity further. However, these intensive practices decrease soil carbon stocks. In contrast, there is limited evidence that improved management of dryland, grazed, hill country grasslands can lead to increases in soil carbon stocks. To address global needs for food security and climate change mitigation, priority actions to increase soil carbon stocks need to focus on improved management practices to increase carbon inputs and retention in soils identified as having high potential for increasing carbon storage. While there are limited data from New Zealand studies, international observations suggest that soil carbon stocks can be increased by enhancing below-ground carbon inputs from plants with deep roots, using swards with diverse species, and moderate grazing rather than harvesting biomass. However, there is less certainty about the processes regulating the formation and decomposition of soil organic matter and their dependence on soil physical properties and microbial access. Scaling findings from plot studies to forecast long-term changes in soil carbon stocks at the landscape scale can be done using models but new approaches are required to integrate the impacts of multiple concurrent practices associated with grazing management.																				2571-581X				OCT 28	2020	4								585913	10.3389/fsufs.2020.585913	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2020.585913													WOS:000588014000001

Here, we compared the biogeographic patterns of rare and abundant bacterial subcommunities and examined the ecological drivers governing their assembly processes in a dryland montane forest of China. Our results showed that a stronger relationship existed between phylogenetic turnover and spatial distance in rare subcommunities compared with that in abundant subcommunities. Null model analysis indicated that abundant subcommunities were predominantly controlled by dispersal limitation, whereas variable selection controlled rare bacterial assembly. More importantly, the balance between deterministic and stochastic processes for abundant and rare subcommunities was regulated by soil pH and soil moisture content, respectively, rather than aridity. Increasing soil moisture decreased the importance of deterministic processes for rare bacterial assembly. In abundant subcommunities, the dominance of stochastic processes was higher in neutral pH soils. Our findings suggested that divergent assembly mechanisms underlying distinct biogeographic patterns in rare and abundant bacterial subcommunities in dryland montane forests, and the assembly mechanisms of abundant and rare bacterial subcommunities were mediated by differentiated environmental factors. Our study provides a new understanding of the generation and maintenance of soil biodiversity in dryland ecosystems.

J	Stone, A				Stone, A.			Dryland dunes and other dryland environmental archives as proxies for Late Quaternary stratigraphy and environmental and climate change in southern Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY												The Namib Desert and the Kalahari constitute the drylands of southern Africa, with the current relatively humid portions of the latter having experienced periodically drier conditions during the Late Quaternary. This study explores the range of dryland archives and proxies available for the past similar to 190 ka. These include classic dryland geomorphological proxies, such as sand dunes, as well as water-lain sediments within former lakes and ephemeral fluvial systems, lake shorelines, sand ramps, water-lain calcrete and tufa sediments at the interface of surface hydrological and hydrogeological, speleotherns and groundwater hydrogeological records, and hyrax middens. Palaeoenvironmental evidence can also be contained within geoarchaeological archives in caves, overhangs and rockshelters. This integration of records is undertaken with the aim of identifying a (or a number of) terrestrial regional chronostratigraphic framework(s) for this time period within southern Africa, because this is missing from the Quaternary stratigraphy lexicon. Owing to a lack of long, near-continuous terrestrial sequences in these drylands, the correspondence between nearby terrestrial records are explored as a basis for parasequences to build this chronostratigraphy. Recognising the modern climatological diversity across the subcontinent, four broad spatial subdivisions are used to explore potential sub-regional parasequences, which capture current climatic gradients, including the hyper-arid west coast and the decrease in aridity from the southwest Kalahari toward the north and east. These are the Namib Desert, the northern Kalahari, the southern Kalahari and the eastern fringes of the southern Kalahari. Terrestrial chronostratigraphies must start from premise that climate-driven environmental shifts may have occurred independently to those in other terrestrial locations and may be diachronous compared to the marine oxygen isotope stratigraphy (MIS), which serves as a global-scale master climatostratigraphy relating to global ice volume. The fragmented nature of preserved evidence means that we are still some way from producing unambiguous parasequences. There is however, a rich record to consider, compile and compare, within which seven broad wetter intervals are identified, with breaks between these inferred to be relatively drier, and some also have proxy evidence for drying. The onset and cessation of these wetter intervals does not align with MIS: they occur with greater frequency, but not with regular periodicity. Precession-paced insolation forcing is often invoked as a key control on southern African climate, but this does not explain the pacing of all of the identified events. Overall, the pattern is complex with some corresponding wetter intervals across space and others with opposing west-east trends. The evidence for drying over the past 10 ka is pronounced in the west (Namib Desert), with ephemerally wet conditions in the south (southern Kalahari). The patterns identified here provide a framework to be scrutinised and to inspire refinements to proposed terrestrial chronostratigraphies for southern Africa. Considering changes across this large geographic area also highlights the complexity in environmental responses across space as we continue to test a range of hypotheses about the nature of climatic forcing in this region.

Ryan			Ecological-niche modeling reveals current opportunities for <i>Agave</i> dryland farming in Sonora, Mexico and Arizona, USA	PLOS ONE												For centuries, humans occupying arid regions of North America have maintained an intricate relationship with Agave (Agavoideae, Asparagaceae). Today Agave cultivation, primarily for beverage production, provides an economic engine for rural communities throughout Mexico. Among known dryland-farming methods, the use of rock piles and cattle-grazed areas stand out as promising approaches for Agave cultivation. Identifying new cultivation areas to apply these approaches in Arizona, USA and Sonora, Mexico warrants a geographic assessment of areas outside the known ranges of rock piles and grasslands. The objective of this study was to predict areas for dryland-farming of Agave and develop models to identify potential areas for Agave cultivation. We used maximum entropy (MaxEnt) ecological-niche-modeling algorithms to predict suitable areas for Agave dryland farming. The model was parameterized using occurrence records of Hohokam rock piles in Arizona and grassland fields cultivated with Agave in Sonora. Ten environmental-predictor variables were used in the model, downloaded from the WorldClim 2 climate database. The model identified potential locations for using rock piles as dryland-farming methods from south-central Arizona to northwestern Sonora. The Agave-grassland model indicated that regions from central to southern Sonora have the highest potential for cultivation of Agave, particularly for the species Agave angustifolia. Results suggest that there are many suitable areas where rock piles can be used to cultivate Agave in the Sonoran Desert, particularly in the border of southeastern Arizona and northwest Sonora. Likewise, cattle-grazing grasslands provide a viable environment for cultivating Agave in southern Sonora, where the expanding bacanora-beverage industry continues to grow and where different Agave products (e.g., syrups, fructans, saponins, and medicinal compounds) can potentially strengthen local economies.																			1932-6203					JAN 20	2023	18	1							e0279877	10.1371/journal.pone.0279877	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279877								36662880					WOS:000967499400001

Long-term cover crop management effects on soil properties in dryland cropping systems	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Replacing summer-fallow by growing cover crops (CC) in semi-arid regions might provide several soil health benefits. This study examined the effects of long-term CC management in place of fallow on soil properties in a no-till (NT) winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor Moench)-fallow (WSF) cropping system. Fallow replacement treatments were spring-planted and included peas (Pisum sativum L.) for grain as well as one-, three-, and six-species CC mixtures compared with summer-fallow. Half of each CC treatment was harvested for forage and the other half remained standing after termination. Soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks within the 0-to 15-cm soil depth increased by 0.14 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for each Mg ha(-1) CC residue added from 2008 to 2012 and were unaffected by CC diversity. However, SOC stocks were not different than fallow in 2018 likely because CC residue inputs declined due to a succession of drought years. Residue contribution from grain sorghum in the WSF rotation best predicted SOC in 2018 compared to 2012. Soil aggregation was greater with CCs compared to peas or fallow and was unaffected by CC diversity. Mean weight diameter (MWD) of water stable aggregates in 2018 was greater with standing CCs (1.11 mm) compared to peas (0.77 mm) but was similar to fallow (0.84 mm). The MWD of dry aggregates with standing (3.55 mm) and hayed (3.62 mm) CCs were greater compared to fallow (2.75 mm). Our findings suggest simple CC mixtures and CCs managed for hay provide similar soil benefits as diverse CC mixtures or CCs left standing in this semi-arid environment.

Biocrusts reduce surface soil infiltrability and impede soil water infiltration under tension and ponding conditions in dryland ecosystem	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Biocrust effects on soil water infiltration and hydropedological processes have attracted increasing attention in dryland ecosystems, but are nevertheless subjected to great controversy. According to some scholars, infiltration was assumed to decrease due to repellency and to increase with the organic matter content due to its role in increasing aggregate stability and porosity. These assumptions were checked in our study on the Loess Plateau of China. By using double-ring and disc infiltrometers, the infiltration curves of cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts as well as on bare soil were continuously measured, and the characteristics of water infiltration on biocrust-covered soil and its correlations with soil properties were analyzed. Our results showed that the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts had significantly lower constant infiltration rates under ponding conditions (0.265 and 0.180 cm min(-1), respectively) as compared with the bare sand (0.372 cm min(-1)), and they took significantly more time (41% and 105%) and water (14% and 73%) to reach steady-state infiltration. Similarly, the saturated hydraulic conductivities of the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts were 39% (0.514 cm min(-1)) and 65% (0.295 cm min(-1)) lower than that of the bare sand (0.839 cm min(-1)), respectively. More importantly, biocrust infiltrability was closely related with biocrust characteristics and soil properties, especially particle-size distribution and crust thickness. Contrary to some assumptions that attributed impeded infiltration to crust repellency, and increased infiltration to the role played by OM, both variables could not have explained the current results. Under tension and ponding conditions, cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts were found to greatly reduce surface soil infiltrability and impede soil water infiltration. These findings should be considered for future analyses of hydropedological processes in arid and semiarid regions.

Modelling prolonged stratification and hypoxia in dryland river waterholes during drought conditions	INLAND WATERS												Dryland river waterholes provide critical habitat and serve as refugia for aquatic animals during droughts, but the quality of these waterholes can often be severely compromised by hypoxic conditions that can lead to mass fish kills and loss of biodiversity. To assist river management, we developed a waterhole-scale ecohydrology model representing thermal stratification and dissolved oxygen regimes during prolonged drought periods in northern Murray-Darling Basin dryland rivers in Queensland, Australia. Model development focused around 6 typical waterholes in these rivers that were shallow (<5 m deep), highly turbid, and stratified with low dissolved oxygen. The model simulations utilised regional climate corrected for local factors such as diurnal vegetation shading and wind sheltering and successfully reproduced the prolonged stratification and hypoxia measured during drought conditions. The simulations highlight the distinct local climate each waterhole experiences due to the combined effects of river morphology and canopy cover that provide various degrees of solar shading and wind sheltering. The model can serve as a tool to inform water management decisions and climate adaptation strategies. Example scenarios demonstrate that (1) even where the canopy shading effect was small (5% at one site), further loss of riparian vegetation could increase temperature by 2-4 & DEG;C in warmer months with prolonged stratification; and (2) under an example RCP 8.5 climate change scenario, water temperature is likely to increase 2-10 & DEG;C, and oxygen saturation will decrease by 10% to 20% in the middle layers for most of the no-flow period by 2080-2099.

Part I: U.S. Southern High Plains Cotton Production	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS												Over semi-arid agricultural regions such as the U.S. Southern High Plains (SHP) producers of dryland crops need to know which management practices increase yields and decrease production risk. Here, a modeling approach is used to explore management options (MO) that increase dryland cotton yields and estimate those practice's yield risk effects under current SHP climate conditions. To simulate current dryland yield variability, dense distributions of lint yield outcomes were generated using the CROPGRO-Cotton crop model driven by weather inputs from 21 SHP weather stations during 2005-2016. Management effects were explored by repeating simulations over 32 MOs defined by 4 planting dates, 4 planting densities, and applying or not applying nitrogen. Both earlier planting date and decreased plant density increased median simulated yields, with earlier planting having the greatest positive yield effects. The simulated MO that produced the highest median lint yields planted on the earliest planting date (May 15), at the lowest density (3 plants m(-1)), and applied no nitrogen. Recent SHP field studies generally confirm the earlier planting date effect, but suggest insignificant yield effects for different seeding rates. Even so, negligible yield effects and lower input costs favor lower seeding densities from a profit standpoint. These crop simulations demonstrate a modeling-based method for climate-related agricultural risk management, and suggest mid-May planting dates and low plant densities as part of management practices that increase yields and profits in dryland SHP cotton production.

Spatial distribution of roots across three dryland ecosystems and plant functional types	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Roots play a critical role in carbon storage, carbon cycling, and resource acquisition in dryland ecosystems, yet their distribution and production patterns are poorly understood. We aimed to compare the vertical and horizontal distribution of roots of the dominant plant functional types across 3 dryland ecosystems in the western Great Plains of the United States. We collected consecutive soil cores from directly under plants to 29 cm away from the center of plant individuals (horizontal plane), to a 20-cm depth (vertical plane). Across the 3 ecosystem types, grass root biomass decreased with depth and, for the sagebrush steppe, at a distance beyond 6.5 cm from the center of the plant. At the 10-20 cm depth increment, there was no horizontal pattern in root biomass. Uniformity in root biomass in the 10-20 cm depth and at distances >6.5 cm from the plant center is best explained by the overlap of roots of individual and neighboring plants to maximize belowground resource uptake. There was much lower root biomass in the surface 20 cm adjacent to shrubs than adjacent to grasses in the sagebrush steppe, and while grass root biomass decreased significantly with depth and distance as described above, shrub roots were uniform in both planes. Our study confirms that root distribution in drylands differs among plant functional types, with grasses exploiting surface soils both horizontally and vertically to capitalize on surface resources, and shrubs capitalizing less on those resources.

Marcelle; Williams, Alwyn			Cover crop functional types alter soil nematode community composition and structure in dryland crop-fallow rotations	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												Increasing dryland cropping intensity by integrating cover crops into crop-fallow rotations can add diversity and alter soil ecosystem functions, including improvements in soil nutrient and water retention and cycling, and suppression of soil-borne pests. However, the use of cover crops can also carry the risk of increasing the abundance of plant-parasitic nematodes that could undermine system productivity. Here, we examined how the integration of diverse cover crops of different functional groups: Poaceae [forage oat (Avena sativa L.)); Brassi-caceae [forage rape (Brassica napus L.)); and Fabaceae [common vetch (Vicia sativa subsp. sativa L. and fababean (Vicia faba L.) in monocultures and mixtures into a dryland crop-fallow rotation altered soil nematode com-munity composition and structure relative to conventional fallows. We found that cover crop mixtures had greater diversity and complexity of free-living nematodes, indicating enhanced cycling of energy and nutrients (enrichment index >50 %) compared to monocultures. Furthermore, using a structural equation modelling approach, we showed the abundance of free-living nematodes is driven primarily by cover crop residue quality (C:N ratio, and cellulose content) and marginally by cover crop quantity (biomass). The grass-legume mixture had the highest abundance of plant-parasitic nematodes (Pratylenchus neglectus and Merlinius brevidens) but also fostered robust soil food webs with complex soil nematode trophic interactions, indicating promotion of soil ecosystem functions related to N and C cycling and overall improvement in soil health. The results indicate bottom-up effects of cover crops on soil nematode communities are modulated by cover crop functional type and mixture composition. Consequently, cover crops with appropriate traits must be selected if soil health is to be improved via suppression of plant-parasitic nematodes, promotion of free-living nematodes, and enhancement of soil food web complexity.

J	Chin, A				Chin, Anne			Implications of a specific storm event for understanding adjustment of urban dryland channels	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Dryland stream channels adjusting to urbanization are difficult to study without some indication of the extent and frequency of specific hydrological events. Investigations of changing channels in Fountain Hills, Arizona, urbanized since 1970, can benefit from knowledge gained from a storm event of over 55 mm rainfall in January 2016, equivalent to similar to 25% of annual precipitation. Morphological flow capacity was reached with this rainfall event, which had a recurrence interval of 1.4 years for a 24-h period and 3.6 years for a 3-day duration. This storm is typical of events that occur in less than half the years of record, occurring between zero and three times each year in the 26 years of record available. Analysis of this event assists in the calibration of measured cross-sections, providing a useful benchmark for space-time substitution in dryland environments where flow is ephemeral. Correspondence of the recurrence interval of the storm to somewhat frequent tankfull' channel-forming events, despite signs of flashiness, suggests a tight coupling between rainfall and runoff and a tempered response to urbanization effects in Fountain Hills- achievable through decades of proactive planning and adaptive wash management in a master-planned community.																			0197-9337	1096-9837				MAY	2022	47	6					1341	1354		10.1002/esp.5365	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/esp.5365		APR 2022											WOS:000779578000001

Restoration is particularly difficult when human activities have pushed an area into a new state with self-reinforcing feedbacks. This study investigated a long-term restoration project in a dryland ecosystem of the Tengger Desert in northwestern China, initiated in 1956. We analyzed shrub and grass cover for 49 yr after the installation of restoration infrastructure that altered external conditions (i.e., using packed straw to reduce wind erosion) and system state (by planting shrubs). After 37-40 yr, the re-vegetation project was successful in restoring the system to a state similar to native vegetation, with high grass cover (30-50%), low shrub cover (8-10%), and a thick biological soil crust (biocrust). However, the shift to high grass cover did not begin until year 37, before which shrub cover was high (15-20%) and grasses were subdominant (usually <10%). The shift from shrub to grass dominance was abrupt, registering significant nonlinear changes over time and relative to a key driver of vegetation dynamics, estimated biocrust thickness. Biocrust thickness increased gradually over time, which reduced rainfall infiltration into deep soil and thus increased soil moisture available for the shallow-rooted grasses. The shift from the bare soil state to the steppe state exhibited a long time lag, suggesting that it can take decades to determine whether dryland restoration efforts succeed. The results indicate that persistence might be critical to forcing desired state transitions and that dryland restoration can proceed as a series of time lags, punctuated by abrupt changes in ecosystem state.

Therefore, this study investigated differences in Se concentration and bioavailability between paddy and dryland soils using data collected from literatures and field sampling. Our analysis showed paddy soil Se concentration in Se-rich area of China was significantly lower than that in dryland soil. Selenium biological concentration factor of rice grain (BCFgrain) in Se-rich area was lower than that in non-Se-rich area attributed to higher percentage of selenite in available Se. Concentration and percentage of available Se were in dryland soil lower than those in paddy soil and this affected BCFgrain of maize, whereas BCFgrain of rice was further influenced by its Se transport capacity. The ranges of Se concentration in Se-rich paddy (0.14-3.63 mg kg(-1)) and dryland (0.45-1.17 mg kg(-1)) soils were derived using a linear regression model. The current soil Se concentration evaluation standard was only suitable for dryland but overestimated Se-deficiency and Se-toxicity levels in paddy field. The present study provides theoretical foundations for understanding Se concentrations and bioavailability in soils and selecting efficient and safe approach on cultivated land use.

Directional selection shifts trait distributions of planted species in dryland restoration	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The match between species trait values and local abiotic filters can restrict community membership. An often-implicit assumption of this relationship is that abiotic filters select for a single locally optimal strategy, though difficulty in isolating effects of the abiotic environment from those of dispersal limitation and biotic interactions has resulted in few empirical tests of this assumption. Similar constraints have made it difficult to assess whether the type and intensity of abiotic filters shift along gradients of environmental harshness, as predicted by the stress-dominance hypothesis. We planted 9,216 plants of 29 perennial grass and forb species that had a range of functional trait values and were assigned to a warm, intermediate or cool temperature tolerance pool across eight sites on the Colorado Plateau. We compared the distributions of traits of surviving individuals to null distributions to evaluate whether there were shifts in trait means and variation. Borrowing from phenotypic selection concepts in evolutionary biology, we assessed support for stabilizing, directional and disruptive abiotic filtering of trait distributions and whether these types of filtering varied with initial species pool. Functional composition was significantly different from null distributions for nearly all traits at all sites, with trait variation more restricted in harsher abiotic conditions, supporting the stress-dominance hypothesis. Contrary to expectations, we primarily found evidence for directional selection, which increased in frequency in warm species pools while disruptive selection was found more often in cool and intermediate species pools. Synthesis. This study provides a controlled experimental approach to test the effect of the abiotic environment on plant trait filtering. We found that opportunistic strategies allowing for rapid water acquisition during favourable periods improved survival at warmer sites. Species with these strategies may be expected to benefit from increasing aridity and may be selected for active management efforts. More generally, the prevalence of directional selection may have important implications for dynamic vegetation models that rely on trait distributions for translating environmental variation into ecosystem processes.

Sammi			Development of green energy based micro-sprinkler irrigation system for small holdings of SAT region	CLEANER ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY												The Indian agriculture in the region of semi-arid tropics (SAT), characterized by small holders, small water harvesting and recycling system assumes a significant potential to sustain agricultural productivity by providing supplemental as well aslifesaving irrigation and mitigating mid-season drought. In Indian Agriculture, major energy consuming activities include on-farm water management. Efficient and cost-effective irrigation system matching the small-scale water harvesting and storage, are anot available in this region. In view of this, a carry-and-irrigate type micro-sprinkler irrigation system was designed and developedin order to achieve the holistic utilization of water resources and niche-potential of solar energy and gravity. The performance was measured on various parameters of application rate, Christiansen uniformity coefficient and pattern efficiency and were quantified as 14.2 mm/h, 91.3% and 89.01% respectively. The develop irrigation system qualified the performance criteria as standardized by ASAE, 1996. Given the characteristics of low cost and portability, it can considerably substantiate the vegetable production at household scale. Though, this system is developed exclusively for the location representing typical dryland agriculture of India, it can be easily and effectively replicated in other part of the world having similar agro-ecosystem. This simple water management technique utilizing the niche potential of gravity and solar energy can significantly contribute to the various objectives of sustainable development goal.																			2666-7908					APR	2022	7								100433	10.1016/j.clet.2022.100433	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clet.2022.100433													WOS:000981169400041

Existence of localized radial patterns in a model for dryland vegetation	IMA JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS												Localized radial patterns have been observed in the vegetation of semi-arid ecosystems, often as localized patches of vegetation or in the form of 'fairy circles'. We consider stationary localized radial solutions to a reduced model for dryland vegetation on flat terrain. By considering certain prototypical pattern-forming systems, we prove the existence of three classes of localized radial patterns bifurcating from a Turing instability. We also present evidence for the existence of localized gap solutions close to a homogeneous instability. Additionally, we numerically solve the vegetation model and use continuation methods to study the bifurcation structure and radial stability of localized radial spots and gaps. We conclude by investigating the effect of varying certain parameter values on the existence and stability of these localized radial patterns.

J	Fagan, ME				Fagan, M. E.			A lesson unlearned? Underestimating tree cover in dryland biases global restoration maps	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Two recent global maps of tree restoration potential have identified vast regions where tree cover could be increased, ranging from 0.9 to 2.3 billion hectares. Both maps, however, emphasized dryland regions, with arid biomes making up 36%-42% of potential restoration area. Dryland biomes have repeatedly been recognized as inappropriate regions for expanding tree cover due to the risks of biodiversity loss, water overconsumption, and fire, so maps that highlight these regions for restoration must sustain careful scrutiny. Here, I show that both recent attempts to map restoration potential in arid regions have been hindered by underlying errors in the global tree cover maps they used. Systematic underestimates of existing sparse tree cover led directly to large overestimates of the potential for tree recovery in drylands. The Atlas of Forest Landscape Restoration Opportunities (Laestadius et al.,Unasylva, 2011,62, 47) overestimated tree restoration potential across a third of arid biomes by between 7% and 20% (55-166 million hectares [Mha]). Similarly, Bastin, Finegold, Garcia, Mollicone, et al. (Science, 2019, 365, 76) overestimated tree restoration potential across all arid biomes by 33%-45% (316-440 Mha). These inaccuracies limit the utility of this research for policy decisions in drylands and overstate the potential for tree planting to address climate change. Given this long-standing but underappreciated challenge in mapping global tree cover, I propose various ways forward that keep this lesson in mind. To better monitor and restore tree cover, I call for re-interpretation and correction of existing global maps, and for a new focus on quantifying sparse tree cover in drylands and other systems.

Upscaling dryland carbon and water fluxes with artificial neural networks of optical, thermal, and microwave satellite remote sensing	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Earth's drylands are home to more than two billion people, provide key ecosystem services, and exert a large influence on the trends and variability in Earth's carbon cycle. However, modeling dryland carbon and water fluxes with remote sensing suffers from unique challenges not typically encountered in mesic systems, particularly in capturing soil moisture stress. Here, we develop and evaluate an approach for the joint modeling of dryland gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and evapotranspiration (ET) in the western United States (US) using a suite of AmeriFlux eddy covariance sites spanning major functional types and aridity regimes. We use artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict dryland ecosystem fluxes by fusing optical vegetation indices, multitemporal thermal observations, and microwave soil moisture and temperature retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) sensor. Our new dryland ANN (DrylANNd) carbon and water flux model explains more than 70 % of monthly variance in GPP and ET, improving upon existing MODIS GPP and ET estimates at most dryland eddy covariance sites. DrylANNd predictions of NEE were considerably worse than its predictions of GPP and ET likely because soil and plant respiratory processes are largely invisible to satellite sensors. Optical vegetation indices, particularly the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), were generally the most important variables contributing to model skill. However, daytime and nighttime land surface temperatures and SMAP soil moisture and soil temperature also contributed to model skill, with SMAP especially improving model predictions of shrubland, grassland, and savanna fluxes and land surface temperatures improving predictions in evergreen needleleaf forests. Our results show that a combination of optical vegetation indices and thermal infrared and microwave observations can substantially improve estimates of carbon and water fluxes in drylands, potentially providing the means to better monitor vegetation function and ecosystem services in these important regions that are undergoing rapid hydroclimatic change.

Multiple resource limitation of dryland soil microbial carbon cycling on the Colorado Plateau	ECOLOGY												Understanding interactions among biogeochemical cycles is increasingly important as anthropogenic alterations of global climate and of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycles interactively affect the Earth system. Ecosystem processes in the dryland biome, which makes up over 40% of Earth's terrestrial surface, are often distinctively sensitive to small changes in resource availability, likely because levels of many resources are low. However, data also suggest that simultaneous changes in the availability of multiple resources may be necessary to affect a response in these low-resource systems, offering an opportunity to test patterns and controls of co-limitation, serial limitation, and individual limitation in soil environments. While drylands may play a governing role in key aspects of Earth's C cycle, and while an improved understanding of resource limitation could substantially improve our forecasts of dryland responses to change, our understanding of interacting controls on soil C cycle processes remains notably poor in these dry systems. Here, we address multiple fundamental hypotheses of resource controls over ecosystem function to test how water, C, N, and P regulate soil C cycling individually and interactively in a dryland ecosystem on the Colorado Plateau. Using a series of laboratory incubations, we found that, while water, C, and N limited C cycling through serial limitation, water alone resulted in an extremely small respiratory response from target organisms, whereas water + C resulted in a dramatic increase in soil C cycling, suggesting a degree of functional co-limitation. Nitrogen additions alone resulted in no changes to soil C cycling, but when N was added in concert with water and C, N greatly increased soil C cycling rates relative to additions of water and C without N. Phosphorus additions had no effect on the C cycle either alone or synergistically. These patterns were consistent with the stoichiometry of the system and interactions among resources were surprising in ways that inform our understanding of critical theories in ecology, such as the Transient Maxima Hypothesis, supporting the suggestion that multiple resource limitation explains pulse-dynamic C cycling in drylands better than water limitation alone.

Dissolved organic matter dynamics in storm water runoff in a dryland urban region	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The temporal and spatial dynamics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) during storm events are well characterized in mesic urban regions, but equivalent studies in arid regions are less frequent, and our understanding of the impacts of arid-land urban storm events on downstream ecosystems remains poorly constrained. We sampled storm runoff in an urban dryland storm drainage system during four summer monsoon storms to determine DOC concentration and composition and to develop a conceptual carbon transport model during storm events. DOC patterns were consistent between storm events despite large differences in discharge and DOC concentration, with the lowest DOC concentrations (2.1-11.7 mg L-1) during first flush, highest concentrations shortly after peak discharge (18.3-46.0 mg L-1), and decreasing concentrations on the descending limb of the hydrograph. Fluorescence Index (FI) values suggested the DOC source shifted throughout events in three distinct phases: Phase 1- autochthonous DOC, Phase 2 - fresh allochthonous DOC, and Phase 3 - processed allochthonous DOC, representing the sequential input of previously disconnected sources during each storm event. Peak DOC concentrations generally lagged peak discharge, supporting distal allochthonous inputs of DOC to the drainage system. A single 11-h storm event delivered more than half the average daily Rio Grande discharge and approximately four times the average daily DOC load. Our findings indicate the significant impact monsoon storm events exert on DOC budgets in dryland rivers, particularly in watersheds drained by urban storm-water conveyances.

In dryland farming, where crop production is highly dependent on rainfall and soil water storage, cover cropping can affect soil water, yet its effects on soil hydrological and biological health require further investigation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of different timing of summer sorghum cover crop termination on soil water, total and labile organic carbon, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and their mediating effects on wheat yield. Through on-farm trial, soil characteristics along with wheat biomass, yield and grain quality were monitored. In comparison with the control (fallow), the early terminated cover crop was the most effective at retaining greater soil water at wheat sowing by 1 similar to 4% in 0-45cm soil profile. An increase in water use efficiency, yield and grain protein by 10%, 12% and 5% was observed under early termination. Under late terminated summer cover crop, there was 7% soil water depletion at wheat planting which resulted in 61% decline in yield. However, late-terminated cover crop achieved the greatest gain in soil total and particulate organic carbon by 17% and 72% and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal Group A and B concentration by 356% and 251%. Summer cover crop incorporation resulted in a rapid gain in labile organic carbon, which constituted hotspots for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi growth, conversely, fungal activities increased labile organic carbon availability. The combined effect of increased soil water at sowing and over the growing season, organic carbon, and microbial activities contributed to greater yield. The findings suggest that summer cover cropping with timely termination can have implications in managing soil water at sowing time and enhancing soil water storage during the season, soil carbon, and facilitating microbial activities while enhancing productivity in the dryland cropping system.

The dynamics of external water conduction in the dryland moss Syntrichia	AOB PLANTS												Syntrichia relies on external water conduction for photosynthesis, survival, and reproduction, a condition referred to as ectohydry. Capillarity spaces are abundant in Syntrichia, but the link between function and morphology is complex. The aim of this study was to provide a better understanding of species-specific morphological traits underlying the functions of water conduction and storage. We used an environmental scanning electron microscope and confocal microscopy for observing anatomical characters in the leaves of Syntrichia species. We also measured hydration/dehydration curves to understand the rate of conduction and dehydration by experimental approaches. Syntrichia is an ectohydric moss that can externally transport and store water from the base of the stem using capillary action. We propose a new framework to study ectohydric capabilities, which incorporates three morphological scales and the timing of going from completely dehydrated to fully hydrated. Characters of interest in this model include cell anatomy (papillae development, hyaline basal cells and laminar cells), architecture of the stem (concavity and orientation) and whole clump characteristics (density of stems). We report significant variations in the speed of conduction, water holding capacity and hydration associated with each species studied (11 in total). All Syntrichia species are capable of external water conduction and storage, but the relevant traits differ among species. These results help to understand potential evolutionary and ecological trade-offs among speed of water conduction, water holding capacity, ontogeny, and differing habitat requirements. An integrative view of ectohydry in Syntrichia contributes to understanding the water relationships of mosses. Terrestrialization imposed major challenges for photosynthetic organisms. Bryophytes adapted to move and store water externally (ectohydry) rather than through a specialized internal machinery (vascular system). This study provides the basis for understanding the main factors influencing ectohydry and understanding of species-specific morphological traits underlying functions of conduction or storage in the dryland moss Syntrichia. Better understanding of the roles of mosses and their water relations, in habitats where these plants form thick 'buffering' layers between the substrate and the atmosphere, will lead to better appreciation of their importance for water retention, storage and flow in dryland ecosystems																			2041-2851					JUN 1	2023	15	3							plad025	10.1093/aobpla/plad025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aobpla/plad025								37292250					WOS:001002793300003

Dryland river restoration via carnivore reintroduction: Nonnative fauna dominate diets of river otters reintroduced to the Upper Rio Grande	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Dryland rivers often harbor abundant populations of nonnative species that threaten native fauna and negatively alter ecosystem structure and function. Native semiaquatic carnivores, such as river otters (Lontra canadensis), that could predate nonnative fauna have been extirpated from many dryland rivers. During 2008-2010, river otters were reintroduced to the Upper Rio Grande (URG), a principal dryland river in the arid southwestern USA that has been colonized by dozens of nonnative fish and invertebrates. We conducted a scat-based food habits study and investigated whether otter reintroduction could be useful for managing nonnative aquatic fauna via predation. Across seasons, nonnative crayfish and fish were the dominant prey items in otter scats; crayfish frequency of occurrence was highest (61-95%), followed by nonnative suckers (7-26%) and trout (3-28%). After accounting for heterogeneous sampling effort between seasons, multi-level models estimated 0.77-0.93 probabilities that scats contained crayfish, compared to 0.05-0.21 and 0.03-0.14 probabilities for suckers and trout, respectively. Reintroducing river otters, and possibly other semiaquatic carnivores, to degraded dryland rivers might be an effective conservation action for controlling nonnative faunal populations within the biomic approach to river restoration, which could reestablish trophic cascades that improve ecosystem structure and function.

Managing dryland wheat to produce high-quality grain	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												The properties of individual grain weight, protein concentration and protein composition contribute to grain quality of wheat. They are known to be affected by genetics, environment and crop management. This paper reports these properties in two dryland field experiments comparing cultivars with similar yield but with contrasting grain weight and number. A large-seeded cultivar, Baviacora, and a small-seeded cultivar, H45, were managed with different nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications and grown in seasons with different rainfall. The aim is to suggest strategies to produce wheat grain of consistently high quality for specified markets, with either preharvest or post-harvest management. Individual grain weight and protein concentration varied throughout the spikes of the cultivars and responded to crop management and environment. Protein concentration within a spike was closely correlated with individual grain weight, increasing by 0.05 +/- 0.006% per mg of additional grain weight, independent of cultivar or position of grains on the spike. Grain protein composition was related to protein concentration of individual grains but was not as sensitive to individual grain weight. Larger grains were associated with less glutenin per unit of protein, partly offsetting the increase in protein concentration with grain weight. Unextracted polymeric protein (%UPP) was unrelated to grain weight but was negatively related to grain protein concentration in Baviacora. If found to be general, the within-spike relationships between individual grain weight, and the concentrations of grain protein, glutenin and %UPP offer promise for improving grain segregation and post-harvest processing to produce grain of closely defined quality from an unprocessed harvest sample.

J	Li, YG; Han, C; Sun, S; Zhao, CM				Li, Yage; Han, Chun; Sun, Shan; Zhao, Changming			Effects of Tree Species and Soil Enzyme Activities on Soil Nutrients in Dryland Plantations	FORESTS												Long-term afforestation strongly changes the soil's physicochemical and biological properties. However, the underlying mechanism of different tree species driving change in soil nutrients is still unclear in the long-term dryland plantations of the Loess Plateau, China. In this study, samples of surface soil (0-20 cm) and woody litter were collected from five plantations (>= 50 years) of Caragana korshinskii, Armeniaca sibirica, Populus hopeiensis, Platycladus orientalis, and Pinus tabulaeformis and a natural grassland, and tested for the carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium contents, as well as the soil sucrase (SC), urease (UE), and alkaline phosphorus (ALP) activities. We found that soil nutrients, enzyme activities, and the litter's chemical properties obviously varied among five tree species. C. korshinskii significantly increased the soil's TC, organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), available nitrogen (AN), and available potassium (AK) by 28.42%, 56.08%, 57.41%, 107.25%, and 10.29%, respectively, and also increased the soil's available phosphorus (AP) by 18.56%; while P. orientalis significantly decreased soil TN (38.89%), TP (30.58%), AP (76.39%), TK (8.25%), and AK (8.33%), and also decreased soil OC (18.01%) and AN (1.09%), compared with those in grassland. The C. korshinskii plantation had higher quality litter and soil enzyme activities than the P. orientalis plantation. Moreover, 62.2% of the total variation in soil nutrients was explained by the litter's chemical properties and soil enzyme activities, and the litter phosphorus (LP) and soil ALP had a more significant and positive impact on soil nutrients. Therefore, tree species, LP, and soil ALP were key factors driving soil nutrient succession in dryland plantations. The significantly positive nitrogen-phosphorus coupling relationship in the "litter-enzyme-soil" system revealed that the improving nitrogen level promoted the phosphorus cycle of the plantation ecosystem. Our results suggest that leguminous tree species are more suitable for dryland afforestation through the regulation of litter quality and soil enzyme activities.

J	Richards, J; Viles, H; Guo, QL				Richards, Jenny; Viles, Heather; Guo, Qinglin			The importance of wind as a driver of earthen heritage deterioration in dryland environments	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Dryland regions are exposed to extreme environmental conditions that create hotspots of weathering and erosion. Many earthen heritage sites are located in these dryland regions and experience extensive deterioration driven by interactions with environmental processes, however previous research has focused largely on the role of rain as a driver of deterioration. This study combines approaches from geomorphology with understandings of earthen materials from heritage science to investigate the relative importance of wind and rain in driving earthen heritage deterioration in drylands. We use geomorphological signatures to infer the environmental histories of earthen walls with a range of known ages at Suoyang Andent City, China, using semi-quantitative deterioration assessments. We find rain-driven deterioration features to be associated with the loss of larger volumes of material and to have higher persistence than wind-driven deterioration features. However, we argue that the high frequency nature of wind events means that wind is an important initiator of deterioration across the site. In addition, walls exposed to the prevailing wind are dominated by wind-driven deterioration features. Outcomes from this study present an opportunity for earthen heritage conservation to investigate potential strategies to minimise wind speed at earthen heritage sites in drylands.

J.; Mubvumba, Partson			Winter cover crop impact on soil health in Texas Rolling Plains dryland cotton	AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES & ENVIRONMENT												The Rolling Plains of Texas are historically semi-arid with sporadic, high intensity storms followed by periods of long drought. Fallow management is a common practice intended to store soil water, but leaves the bare soil exposed to erosive forces that can diminish the soil productivity. Cover crops in no-till (NT) agriculture have been proposed to increase soil health under environments with low precipitation as an alternative to fallow management. This study evaluated multiple treatments in a dryland cotton system including: (1) conventional tillage (CT); (2) NT; and NT with the following cover crops: (3) wheat; (4) Austrian winter pea; (5) crimson clover; (6) hairy vetch; and (7) mixed species cover. Soil samples were collected at 0, 3, and 6 weeks after cover crop termination and analyzed for soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, inorganic N, water-extractable organic carbon, water-extractable organic nitrogen, carbon mineralization, and phospholipid fatty acid analysis. For all parameters tested, there was no significant difference between CT and NT at any date or depth, so the addition of cover crops to NT cotton systems might be needed in order to enhance NT in regard to soil function. The multi-species mixed treatment was predicted to perform the best out of the cover crop treatments due to its combined benefits from grasses and legumes. However, the single-species Austrian winter pea treatment had 24% and 28% higher soil carbon and nitrogen than no-till without a cover crop, and can be a useful alternative to fallow management under these dryland agriculture conditions.

Multiple mechanisms determine the effect of warming on plant litter decomposition in a dryland	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												In drylands, where soil fertility is typically low, plant litter decomposition provides particularly critical carbon and nitrogen inputs into soil. Although climate change is projected to increase the already large global extent of drylands, it is unknown how warmer temperatures will affect core ecosystem processes, such as plant litter decomposition, in these systems. To address this key unknown, we conducted a litterbag study in a long-term dryland warming experiment in southeastern Utah, USA. Unexpectedly, we did not find an overall effect of warming on leaf litter mass loss over time. Instead, our results indicated both positive and negative effects of warming on mass loss which offset one another. In particular, our findings suggested that a warming-induced degradation of biological soil crusts (soil surface community of mosses, lichens, and/or cyanobacteria that live in drylands worldwide) increased soil-litter mixing, thereby accelerating decomposition. Results also suggested that a warming-induced reduction in litter moisture slowed decomposition. In addition, we found that warming lowered the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of the decomposing litter. These results showed that warming did not alter the total litter mass-loss rates in this ecosystem, but that decomposition patterns were affected through more nuanced changes to both the biological and physical environment of dryland soils.

However, limited data exist on the long term impact of crop rotations on soil multifunctionality and its link with soil fungal community in drylands.MethodsIn a dryland field experiment with 30-year legume- and non-legume-based winter wheat rotations and winter wheat-fallow system, we investigated the soil multifunctionality (via cycling and pools of soil carbon and nitrogen) and the overall community and functional groups of soil fungi. The links between soil multifunctionality and fungal communities were also explored.ResultsWe found that long-term crop rotation increased soil multifunctionality index and that of carbon cycle. Crop rotation shifted soil fungal community composition, and reduced the proportion of putative pathotrophs. The overall fungal community was almost equally explained by soil and plant variables, while fungal functional groups (i.e., saprotrophs and pathotrophs) were more affected by soil variables. The indicator taxa in the non-legume-winter wheat rotation were distinctly different from those in the legume-based winter wheat rotation soils, indicating that the non-legume-winter wheat rotation selects different fungal taxa from the legume-based winter wheat rotation. Moreover, the changes in community composition of soil fungi, putative saprotrophs and pathotrophs were related to soil multifunctionality and that of carbon and nitrogen cycles.ConclusionsOur results highlight that long-term crop rotations shape the soil fungal communities; the changes in soil fungi and fungal functional groups have potential to improve soil multifunctionality in the crop rotation systems in drylands.																			0032-079X	1573-5036				2023 NOV 27	2023										10.1007/s11104-023-06412-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-023-06412-w		NOV 2023											WOS:001114061900001

The availability of high-resolution remote sensing data can significantly improve GPP estimation of small-scale agricultural fields. Multispectral satellite data with 3-m spatial resolution and frequent global coverage are available from the PlanetScope network of satellites. However, this data remains largely unexplored for studying the carbon dynamics of agroecosystems. The overarching goal of this study was to develop a simple empirical method for quantifying the GPP of dryland maize (Zea mays L.) using remotely sensed vegetation indices along with in-situ measurements of photosynthetically active radiation and leaf area index by linking it with carbon uptake data from an eddy covariance flux tower. Four vegetation indices were investigated: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), the weighted difference vegetation index (WDVI), and the two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2). This study was conducted over a three-year period from 2017 to 2019 in East-Central Texas. A total of 12 GPP prediction models were developed using individual yearly data and were used for predicting GPP of the other 2 years. Predicted maize GPP values were then compared against tower-based GPP. The NDVI models were the least successful in predicting GPP and had the highest root mean square error (average: 10.1 3 gC m-2; maximum: 26.3 gC m-2). Models based on SAVI performed especially well with error ranging from 0.05 to 0.94 gC m-2. The slope of the regression between SAVI-based estimated GPP and measured GPP was not different from 1.0 in all combinations of years. The success of the SAVI-based GPP models for predicting dryland maize carbon uptake indicates that it was the least affected vegetation index by changing soil background condition in this row cropping system.

Dryland nitrogen deposition induces microbiome-driven increases in biocrust respiration and losses of soil carbon	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Biocrusts are a dominant component in drylands worldwide and play critical roles in supporting soil microbial diversity and carbon (C) stocks. Nitrogen (N) fertilization associated with human activities threatens drylands, which are often considered N-limited ecosystems. Here, we conducted a field experiment in two contrasting soil types (loess vs. sand) to investigate the impacts of low (30 kg N ha-1 year-1) and high (90 kg N ha-1 year-1) fertilization on moss-biocrust dominated traits, soil nutrients, microbial taxonomic richness, soil C stocks and respiration rates (Rs). We showed that 5 months of N addition resulted in reductions in soil organic C content by 91% and increased both soil microbial richness and diversity. Our results further showed that relative to controls, low levels of N addition increased biocrust Rs by 52% through increased moss biomass and density (38% and 73%) and microbial taxonomic richness and diversity (18% and 23%), while no significant changes in biocrust Rs were observed after high levels of N addition. Considering multiple environmental factors simultaneously, we show that N fertilization indirectly promoted soil respiration and C losses via increases in microbial richness and diversity, which are critical drivers of soil function. Our work provides solid evidence that N deposition, even at low levels of N addition, can result in rapid losses of C in dryland soils. Our findings suggest that to maintain healthy dryland ecosystems and promote C, we must mitigate future land degradation and minimize anthropogenic N deposition.

Hence, the investigation has been made on the activities of enzymes involved in carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur cycles and metabolic potentials microbial communities of rhizospheric soil of drought-affected areas planted with Cymbopogon flexuosus (lemongrass). The slips of C. flexuosus were planted in the six drought-affected areas of India along with one irrigated region as control following randomized block design. The pH of soils varied from 5.7 to 9.4, whereas, microbial biomass content ranged from 80 mu g g-1 (sodic soil) to 813 mu g g-1 (black humus granitic soil) mu g g-1. Enhanced enzymatic activities were found after two years at all the experimental sites planted with C. flexuosus. In comparison with the drought-affected site, higher microbial diversity (highest Shannon Index) was observed at the irrigated site. The results showed that soil microbiota was dominated by Proteobacteria followed by Firmicutes and Acidobacteria, whereby, Methylobacterium, Escherichia-Shigella, Sphingomonas, Microbacterium, and Brevibacillus were the dominant genera in the study zone. Acidic soils (pH: 5.7) were observed to have a relatively higher abundance of Acidobacteria, while, alkaline soils (pH: 9.4) demonstrated a higher relative abundance of Proteobacteria. The dominance of Escherichia-Shigella and Sphingomonas was observed in all drought sites and these microbes are involved in carbon metabolism. The relative abundance of Methylobacterium was higher in soils having higher microbial biomass and carbon content. Results revealed that despite the homogenizing effect of the lemongrass cover, the soil pH accounted for an important fraction of the variance of microbial composition and enzymatic activity.

Transmission losses reduce flood stage, recharge local and regional aquifers and, are main sources of groundwater recharge in dryland areas. This study determines the seasonal relationships between upstream flows and channel transmission losses along a river reach in Runde River catchment in Zimbabwe. Using regression equations, channel transmission loss volumes were modelled as the response variables while upstream flow volumes were the predictor variables. The study shows significant (p = 0.000) positive linear relationships between reach upstream flow and transmission loss during the cool, hot and rainy seasons. Also, during the post rainy season, a significant (p = 0.000) power relationship exist between reach upstream flow and transmission loss. This simple approach helps to understand water balances and transmission losses in data scarce dryland river systems.																			2042-7808	2042-7816					2022	14	3					306	315		10.1504/IJHST.2022.125670	http://dx.doi.org/10.1504/IJHST.2022.125670													WOS:000925907800005

A coupled agent-based model to analyse human-drought feedbacks for agropastoralists in dryland regions	FRONTIERS IN WATER												Drought is a persistent hazard that impacts the environment, people's livelihoods, access to education and food security. Adaptation choices made by people can influence the propagation of this drought hazard. However, few drought models incorporate adaptive behavior and feedbacks between adaptations and drought. In this research, we present a dynamic drought adaptation modeling framework, ADOPT-AP, which combines socio-hydrological and agent-based modeling approaches. This approach is applied to agropastoral communities in dryland regions in Kenya. We couple the spatially explicit hydrological Dryland Water Partitioning (DRYP) model with a behavioral model capable of simulating different bounded rational behavioral theories (ADOPT). The results demonstrate that agropastoralists respond differently to drought due to differences in (perceptions of) their hydrological environment. Downstream communities are impacted more heavily and implement more short-term adaptation measures than upstream communities in the same catchment. Additional drivers of drought adaptation concern socio-economic factors such as wealth and distance to wells. We show that the uptake of drought adaptation influences soil moisture (positively through irrigation) and groundwater (negatively through abstraction) and, thus, the drought propagation through the hydrological cycle.

Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF), a proxy for photosynthesis, offers potential to alleviate such challenge. We here explore this potential using dryland systems along the North Australian Tropical Transect with SIF derived from Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2. SIF identified the seasonal onset and senescence of Gross Primary Production at eddy covariance sites with improved accuracy over Enhanced Vegetation Index and Near-Infrared Reflectance of terrestrial Vegetation from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, especially at inland xeric shrublands. At regional scale, SIF depicted both earlier onset and senescence across North Australian Tropical Transect. We hypothesized that SIF outperformed Enhanced Vegetation Index and Near-Infrared Reflectance of terrestrial Vegetation mainly because, unlike reflectance, it is not contaminated by background soil, and its total signal is contributed by mixed plant species in additive way. Plain Language Summary Australian dryland ecosystems are critical in regulating the global land carbon sink dynamics. However, it is challenging to accurately characterize their phenology from spaceborne measurements. On the one hand, tropical savannas and semiarid ecosystems (e.g., grasslands and shrublands) are typically composed of a complex mixture of species (woody trees and C-4 grasses) with each having distinct morphologies and physiological responses to climate condition; on the other hand, such ecosystems are highly sensitive to irregular rainfall events and are often subject to disturbances such as fires and storms. In this study, we utilized the North Australian Tropical Transect rainfall gradient as a "natural laboratory" to assess the ability of satellite solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence to capture the phenological dynamics of dryland vegetation, in comparison with traditional reflectance-based vegetation indices, that is, Enhanced Vegetation Index and Near-Infrared Reflectance of terrestrial Vegetation. Results showed that satellite solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence outperformed Enhanced Vegetation Index and Near-Infrared Reflectance of terrestrial Vegetation for characterizing seasonal onset and senescence along North Australian Tropical Transect and therefore had potential for improving large-scale mapping of phenology dynamics of dryland ecosystems over traditional remote sensing of reflectance-based vegetation indices.

J	Singh, O; Saini, D; Bhardwaj, P				Singh, Omvir; Saini, Divya; Bhardwaj, Pankaj			Characterization of meteorological drought over a dryland ecosystem in north western India	NATURAL HAZARDS												Droughts are the greatest and the most recurrent climatic hazard that frequently strikes India, fetching serious water deficiencies, economic failures and unfriendly social events. An investigation of regional droughts can help policy makers in achieving the goals of sustainable governance of water resources. Hence, this study examined the characteristics of meteorological drought over the dryland ecosystem of Rajasthan state in north western India, based largely on diurnal rainfall statistics of 33 stations for the period 1961-2017. For investigating meteorological drought, standardized precipitation index (SPI) was computed at various time spans such as early (June to August), mid (August to September), late (September to October) and whole kharif season (June to October) as well as annually (January to December) to study the deficiency or surplus of water about its normal availability. In the same way, primary drought attributes, for example severity, frequency, magnitude, duration, intensity, return periods and trends, were computed and their distribution maps were prepared by employing geospatial techniques. During the study period, nearly half of the years experienced a meteorological drought at all-time scales. Fascinatingly, more than 90 percent of them were of mild drought, whereas severe and extreme droughts were unusual. Surprisingly, during the year 2002, all stations experienced a mixture of normal, moderate, severe and extreme droughts. The drought frequency followed an order of mid-season > whole kharif season > early season > late season > annual. The western, northern and southern parts (low to moderately elevated) experienced wetter conditions (significant at 95% confidence level). In contrast, the north eastern, eastern and south eastern regions (moderately to highly elevated) witnessed increased drier situations, though statistically it was found non-significant. Finally, the results of this study suggest that the investigation of SPI-based meteorological drought will be helpful in developing effective drought management plans over the dryland ecosystem.

However, the consequence of climate change on WC services is largely unknown, particularly in mountain areas with limited data availability. By using a parametric model driven by ground and satellite remote sensing data, the spatial distribution of WC and its inter-annual trends and variability were assessed in the Qilian Mountains to differentiate the main factors for WC dynamics. Our results showed that the spatiotemporal variation of modeled WC and remotely sensed soil moisture was consistent. Mean annual WC showed a contrary trend with increasing annual mean air temperature and precipitation and was higher in forests than grasslands and deserts. In the context of warm and humid climates, percentage of the area with a significant increase and decrease in annual WC from 2000 to 2019 was 32.2% and 4.2% (p < 0.05), respectively. WC declines appeared mainly in a forest steppe zone at an altitude of 2600-3300 m, as increased vegetation growth boosted water consumption and eventually led to soil drying. Increases in WC were largely attributed to increasing precipitation and decreasing solar radiation, making a contribution of 39.4 and 38.4%, respectively. WC was positively correlated with precipitation but negatively related to land surface temperature (p < 0.05). A negative relationship between WC and solar radiation was prevalent in deserts. Precipitation and vegetation growth explained 50.1% and 22.8%, respectively, of the inter-annual variability in WC. The findings of this study highlight the importance of evapotranspiration in controlling WC dynamics in the forest steppe zone of a dryland mountain, where a risk from reduced water conservation may increase under future climate warming. To conserve grassland and desert ecosystems is more beneficial to improve the WC function of the Qilian Mountains as compared to afforestation.					peng, yan/JCO-1763-2023; Li, Yaqi/JEF-2795-2023; Wang, Tianqi/JJD-7473-2023; Wang, Xiaoqiang/IQS-3727-2023; Wang, Xiaogang/B-2439-2013; Wang, Jing/IQW-3496-2023; Wang, Xin/JCE-2009-2023; Wang, Xin/AAN-8435-2021; Wang, Luyao/JLL-2001-2023; Wang, Xin/HZL-4695-2023; Xu, Hao-jie/F-6263-2019; Wang, Siyi/JNT-2690-2023; LI, XIAO/IQV-9318-2023; wang, xu/IAN-4886-2023; Wang, Xin-ping/P-4894-2018	Wang, Xiaogang/0000-0002-7929-5889; Wang, Jing/0000-0002-8296-2961; Wang, Xin/0000-0002-4457-7376; Wang, Xin/0000-0002-4457-7376; Xu, Hao-jie/0000-0002-6389-7084; Wang, Xin-ping/0000-0002-7052-9044; Chen, Shengyun/0000-0002-3272-2628													0959-6526	1879-1786				AUG 15	2022	362								132574	10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132574	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132574		JUN 2022											WOS:000821862400004

The use of large amounts of fertilizer can decrease fertility and biodiversity and increase acidification, thereby seriously restricting the sustainable utilization of dryland red soil resources. Therefore, there is an urgent need for techniques that improve the crop quality and yield in dryland red soil areas. Returning crop waste to fields as fertilizer is a promising approach to sustainable agriculture. In the present study, the effects of applying peanut shell and an associated biochar product to dryland red soil were investigated, with a focus on soil microbial activity and community structure. Field experiments were conducted in Jiangxi Province, southern China, in 2020, in field plots of sweet potato crops. Seven treatments were set up according to the principle of equal carbon return to farmland: Control: (conventional fertilization); S1, S2, S3 (peanut shell appli-cation of 3000, 4500 and 6000 kg hm-2, respectively); and BC1, BC2, BC3 (peanut shell biochar application of 1000, 1500 and 2000 kg hm-2, respectively). The application of peanut shell and its biochar improved soil basal respiration, with the greatest increase relative to controls of 161.06% found in treatment S3 at the root harvest stage. The most obvious increase in microbial biomass carbon content due to biochar application was 206.50% in treatment BC2 at the root harvest stage. The application of peanut shell and its biochar increased the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) contents of total soil microorganisms and different microbial groups. The maximum increases in the PLFA contents of total soil microorganisms, gram-positive bacteria, and gram-negative bac-teria occurred at the early root formation stage in treatment BC2, which were 112.16%, 102.52%, and 115.64%, respectively. Both peanut shell and biochar increased the PLFA contents of soil actinomycetes, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and other fungi to certain extents. The soil actinomycetes PLFAs increased by 120.08% at the early root formation stage in BC2, while the AMF PLFAs increased by 79.44% at the seedling stage in S2. This study provides theoretical and practical guidance for the comprehensive utilization of peanut shell and the implementation of circular agriculture in dryland red soil regions. It also provides a scientific basis for improving the fertility of dryland red soil.					徐, 尚起/IUD-1729-2023															2405-8440				FEB	2023	9	2							e12604	10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e12604	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e12604		FEB 2023						36814625					WOS:000968476300001

Analyzing differences in fluvial morphology in drylands is beneficial for studying ancient rock records and the extraterrestrial surface environment. The remote sensing image, characterized by real-time and possibility of repeated observations, is a vital tool for recording and comparing fluvial systems in drylands. Satellite remote sensing technology is a method of investigating fluvial morphologies. Due to the limited accuracy of satellite imagery, there are few reports on the detailed description of the fluvial system in drylands of NW China. We analyze the pattern of fluvial morphology changes in the Golmud distributive fluvial system (DFS) in the Qaidam Basin, northwestern China, using satellite remote sensing and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Firstly, we use Google Earth real-time image data, historical image data, and radar digital elevation data to extract geomorphological information; then the UAV remote sensing image data were used to interpret fluvial network information; finally, we use the gray-scale differential vector method to describe the fluvial morphologies. Three zones have been identified in the Golmud DFS: the proximal, the medial, and the distal, by comparing the differences in topographic and geomorphic characteristics, fluvial morphologies, and sedimentary characteristics of the Golmud DFS. The proximal slope is higher than the other two zones, and the geomorphic features are mainly gravel gobi. The proximal fluvial morphologies are mainly large braided rivers, and sediments are more gravelly and less sandy. The medial slope is relatively small, and the geomorphic features are mostly oasis plains. The medial fluvial morphologies are mainly meandering rivers associating with braided rivers, and sediments are more sandy and less gravelly. The distal slope is the lowest, and the geomorphic features are mostly oasis plains, lakes, and marsh plains. The distal fluvial morphologies are mainly meandering rivers, and sediments are sandy and muddy. Comparison of the DFS from proximal to medial to distal in Golmud confirmed the potential of remote sensing image technology in identifying the fluvial morphologies and sedimentary facies distribution in dryland.

The interception of rainfall by vegetation is a critical process in the water balance of drylands; thus, this study estimated the canopy interception capacity and interception rates as well as stemflow of three typical Mediterranean shrub species (Rosmarinus officinalis, Thymus vulgaris, and Macrochloa tenacissima) of three size classes in Spain under a simulated extreme rainfall rate (similar to 8 mm min(-1), historical return period of >100 years). Given that these plants' canopy structures markedly differ from taller woody plants (i.e., trees), a novel method was developed to assess the stemflow fraction. Results showed significant differences in interception amount, rates, and storage capacity among the shrub species, with variations in plant morphology, such as shrub height and canopy diameter, being the key factors determining interception capacity. R. officinalis had the highest interception fraction per unit canopy area, or 'specific interception,' (18.4%). In contrast, the lowest specific interception fraction was measured for M. tenacissima (6.5%). Thymus vulgaris was characterized by the highest stemflow yields per unit canopy area (4.85 mm) and fraction (up to 29.6% of rainfall), which was the lowest for M. tenacissima (1.09 mm, similar to 1%-4%). Strong linear correlations were found between canopy interception and shrub canopy diameter (|r| > -0.51, max = -0.90), when observations were grouped for size class. These linear correlations between shrub morphology and partitioning enabled multiple-regression linear models to be developed that predicted canopy interception and stemflow with good accuracy (r(2) > 0.64, with a maximum of 0.82) from shrub height, canopy diameter, dry biomass, size class, and species. Despite these measurements being conducted under one extreme storm depth and intensity, the results provide: (i) values of rainfall partitioning for important shrub species in Mediterranean dryland environments; and (ii) a simple but reliable model that may be further developed (e.g., embedding variable rainfall values as weather input or incorporating other morphological parameters) and may be integrated into complex hydrological models.

Phenazine-1-Carboxylic Acid-Producing Bacteria Enhance the Reactivity of Iron Minerals in Dryland and Irrigated Wheat Rhizospheres	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic produced by rhizobacteria in the dryland wheat fields of the Columbia Plateau. PCA and other phenazines reductively dissolve Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides in bacterial culture systems, but the impact of PCA upon Fe and Mn cycling in the rhizosphere is unknown. Here, concentrations of dithionite-extractable and poorly crystalline Fe were approximately 10% and 30-40% higher, respectively, in dryland and irrigated rhizospheres inoculated with the PCA-producing (PCA(+)) strain Pseudomonas synxantha 2-79 than in rhizospheres inoculated with a PCA-deficient mutant. However, rhizosphere concentrations of Fe(II) and Mn did not differ significantly, indicating that PCA-mediated redox transformations of Fe and Mn were transient or were masked by competing processes. Total Fe and Mn uptake into wheat biomass also did not differ significantly, but the PCA(+) strain significantly altered Fe translocation into shoots. X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy revealed an abundance of Fe-bearing oxyhydroxides and phyllosilicates in all rhizospheres. These results indicate that the PCA(+) strain enhanced the reactivity and mobility of Fe derived from soil minerals without producing parallel changes in plant Fe uptake. This is the first report that directly links significant alterations of Fe-bearing minerals in the rhizosphere to a single bacterial trait.

J	Stavi, I; Yizhaq, H; Osem, Y; Argaman, E				Stavi, Ilan; Yizhaq, Hezi; Osem, Yagil; Argaman, Eli			Positive impacts of livestock and wild ungulate routes on functioning of dryland ecosystems	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Livestock grazing is often perceived as being detrimental to the quality and functioning of dryland ecosystems. For example, a study in a semiarid Kenyan savanna proposed that cattle form bare spaces throughout the landscape, which indicate ecosystem degradation. Other studies, conducted in north-eastern Spain, where climatic conditions range between semiarid and Mediterranean subhumid, reported that sheep and goat trails have increased the emergence of rill erosion processes. Sometimes, this negative perception is extended to include wild, large ungulate herbivores as well. Here, we challenge this perception by highlighting the generally nonadverse and even ameliorative impacts of moderate animal rate on geoecosystem functioning of hilly drylands. Specifically, trampling routes (also known as treading paths, livestock terracettes, cattle trails, migration tracks, cowtours, etc.) formed across hillslopes by grazing animals-being either domesticated livestock or native large herbivores-transform the original two-phase vegetation mosaic of shrubby patches and interpatch spaces into a three-phase mosaic. The animal routes increase the complexity of ecosystem, by strengthening the spatial redistribution of water and soil resources at the patch scale and decreasing hydrological connectivity at the hillslope scale. As a consequence, the animal routes improve functioning of hilly drylands and increase their resilience to long-term droughts and climatic change. Therefore, instead of viewing the animal routes as degraded spots, they should be perceived at a wider perspective that allows to properly understand their overall role in sustaining dryland geoecosystems.

Mapping biological soil crusts in a Hawaiian dryland	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Historical and ongoing land use patterns in the Hawaiian Islands have degraded the Islands' drylands, causing erosion and detrimentally affecting adjacent coastal marine ecosystems. Biological soil crust (biocrust) communities have been shown to increase soil stability in drylands worldwide, but their efficacy in mitigating soil erosion in Hawaiian drylands is largely unknown. Using a combination of field data and imagery collected by small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS), we mapped biocrusts and examined their influence on soil stability in the Kawaihae watershed, an erosion-prone dryland on leeward Hawai`i Island. We created classified maps of biocrust cover from imagery collected at three spatial resolutions (1.2, 2.1 and 2.8 cm/pixel) using the pixel-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and investigated the impacts of spatial resolution and biocrust level of development on classification accuracy. Our medium (2.1 cm) resolution image produced the highest overall classification accuracy when biocrust was treated as a single class (82.1%). We explored the spatial impacts of biocrusts on soil loss via sUAS-derived measurements of elevation change over a four-year time span. We found differences in soil loss among land cover types, but robustly quantifying these was a challenge, as much of the change fell below statistically significant limits of detection. We investigated the relationship between biocrust development and soil stability by conducting soil aggregate stability testing at the three biocrust levels of development (LODs) present at the study site. We found a significant increase in soil stability from soils without surface biocrusts (LOD score of 0) to those with biocrusts at any development level (LOD 1-3). Our research adds to the body of biocrust knowledge by presenting new information about biocrust distribution and soil stabilization capabilities in Hawaiian drylands. We also provide insights into the trade-offs between spatial resolution and classification accuracy for biocrust classification and land cover analysis.

Hydrological connectivity is a useful framework for understanding water redistribution and scaling issues associated with runoff and sediment production, since human and/or natural disturbances alter surface water availability and pathways increasing/decreasing connectivity. In this paper, we illustrate the use of the connectivity framework for several examples of dryland systems that are analysed at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. In doing so, we draw particular attention to the analysis of coevolution of system structures and function, and how they may drive threshold behaviour leading to desertification and degradation. We first analyse the case of semi-arid rangelands, where feedbacks between the decline in vegetation density and landscape erosion reinforces degradation processes driven by changes in connectivity until a threshold is crossed above which the return to a functional system is unlikely. We then focus on semi-arid wetlands, where decreases in water volumes promote terrestrial vegetation encroachment that changes drainage conditions and connectivity, potentially reinforcing redistribution of flow paths to other wetland areas. The analysis of dryland wetlands is based on a novel hydrologic connectivity index derived using inundation requirements for wetland vegetation associations. The examples presented highlight the need to incorporate a coevolutionary framework for the analysis of changing connectivity patterns and the emergence of thresholds in arid and semi-arid systems.

J	Perry, EK; Newman, DK				Perry, Elena K.; Newman, Dianne K.			Prevalence and Correlates of Phenazine Resistance in Culturable Bacteria from a Dryland Wheat Field	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Phenazines are a class of bacterially produced redox-active natural antibiotics that have demonstrated potential as a sustainable alternative to traditional pesticides for the biocontrol of fungal crop diseases. However, the prevalence of bacterial resistance to agriculturally relevant phenazines is poorly understood, limiting both the understanding of how these molecules might shape rhizosphere bacterial communities and the ability to perform a risk assessment for off-target effects. Here, we describe profiles of susceptibility to the antifungal agent phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) across more than 100 bacterial strains isolated from a wheat field where PCA producers are indigenous and abundant. We found that Gram-positive bacteria are typically more sensitive to PCA than Gram-negative bacteria, and there was significant variability in susceptibility both within and across phyla. Phenazine-resistant strains were more likely to be isolated from the wheat rhizosphere, where PCA producers were also more abundant, compared to bulk soil. Furthermore, PCA toxicity was pH-dependent for most susceptible strains and broadly correlated with PCA reduction rates, suggesting that uptake and redox-cycling were important determinants of phenazine toxicity. Our results shed light on which classes of bacteria are most likely to be susceptible to phenazine toxicity in acidic or neutral soils. In addition, the taxonomic and phenotypic diversity of our strain collection represents a valuable resource for future studies on the role of natural antibiotics in shaping wheat rhizosphere communities. IMPORTANCE Microbial communities contribute to crop health in important ways. For example, phenazine metabolites are a class of redox-active molecules made by diverse soil bacteria that underpin the biocontrol of diseases of wheat and other crops. Their physiological functions are nuanced. In some contexts, they are toxic. In others, they are beneficial. While much is known about phenazine production and the effect of phenazines on producing strains, our ability to predict how phenazines might shape the composition of environmental microbial communities is poorly constrained. In addition, phenazine prevalence in the rhizosphere has been predicted to increase in arid soils as the climate changes, providing an impetus for further study. As a step toward gaining a predictive understanding of phenazine-linked microbial ecology, we document the effects of phenazines on diverse bacteria that were coisolated from a wheat rhizosphere and identify conditions and phenotypes that correlate with how a strain will respond to phenazines.																			0099-2240	1098-5336				MAR	2022	88	6							e02320-21	10.1128/aem.02320-21	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/aem.02320-21								35138927					WOS:000772651100031

We used a spatial analysis approach with a daily time-step coupled radiation and transpiration efficiency model to simulate the impact of the reduced-tillering trait on wheat yield under different climate change scenarios across Australia's arable land. Our results show a small but consistent yield advantage of the reduced-tillering trait in the most water-limited environments both under current and likely future conditions. Our climate scenarios show that whilst elevated [CO2] (e[CO2]) alone might limit the area where the reduced-tillering trait is advantageous, the most likely climate scenario of e[CO2] combined with increased temperature and reduced rainfall consistently increased the area where restricted tillering has an advantage. Whilst long-term average yield advantages were small (ranged from 31 to 51 kg ha(-1) year(-1)), across large dryland areas the value is large (potential cost-benefits ranged from Australian dollar 23 to 60 MIL/year). It seems therefore worthwhile to further explore this reduced-tillering trait in relation to a range of different environments and climates, because its benefits are likely to grow in future dry environments where wheat is grown around the world.

Connecting dryland fine-fuel assessments to wildfire exposure and natural resource values at risk	FIRE ECOLOGY												BackgroundWildland fire in arid and semi-arid (dryland) regions can intensify when climatic, biophysical, and land-use factors increase fuel load and continuity. To inform wildland fire management under these conditions, we developed high-resolution (10-m) estimates of fine fuel across the Altar Valley in southern Arizona, USA, which spans dryland, grass-dominated ecosystems that are administered by multiple land managers and owners. We coupled field measurements at the end of the 2021 growing season with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and vegetation indices acquired during and after the growing season to develop predictions of fine fuel across the entire valley. We then assessed how climate, soil, vegetation, and land-use factors influenced the amount and distribution of fine fuels. We connected fine fuels to fire management points, past ignition history, and socio-economic vulnerability to evaluate wildfire exposure and assessed how fuel related to habitat of the endangered masked bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus ridgwayi).ResultsThe high amount of fine fuel (400-3600 kg/ha; mean = 1392 kg/ha) predicted by our remote sensing model (R-2 = 0.63) for 2021 compared to previous years in the valley was stimulated by near-record high growing season precipitation that was 177% of the 1990-2020 mean. Fine fuel increased across the valley if it was contained within the wildlife refuge boundary and had lower temperature and vapor pressure deficit, higher soil organic content, and abundant annual plants and an invasive perennial grass (R-2 = 0.24). The index of potential exposure to wildfire showed a clustering of high exposure centered around roads and low-density housing development distant from fire management points and extending into the upper elevations flanking the valley. Within the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, fine fuel increased with habitat suitability for the masked bobwhite quail within and adjacent to core habitat areas, representing a natural resource value at risk, accompanied with higher overall mean fine fuel (1672 kg/ha) in relation to 2015 (1347 kg/ha) and 2020 (1363 kg/ha) means.ConclusionsBy connecting high-resolution estimates of fine fuel to climatic, biophysical and land-use factors, wildfire exposure, and a natural resource value at risk, we provide a pro-active and adaptive framework for fire risk management within highly variable and rapidly changing dryland landscapes.

J	Scanlon, TT; Doncon, G				Scanlon, Timothy T.; Doncon, Greg			Rain, rain, gone away: decreased growing-season rainfall for the dryland cropping region of the south-west of Western Australia	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE												The shift in Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures in 1976 led to a change in rainfall for the broad-scale winter annual grain cropping and pasture region in the south-west of Western Australia (the WA wheatbelt). Agriculture in the eastern part the WA wheatbelt was particularly sensitive to the change in rainfall because it is a marginal area for agronomic production, with low rainfall before changes in sea surface temperature. A second shift in sea surface temperature occurred in 2000, but there has been no analysis of the resulting impact on rainfall in the eastern WA wheatbelt. An analysis of rainfall pre- and post-2000 was performed for sites in the eastern WA wheatbelt in three groups: 19 sites in the west, 56 central, and 10 east. The analysis found a decline in growing-season rainfall (i.e. April-October), especially during May-July, post-2000. Rainfall declines of 49.9 mm (west group), 39.1 mm (central group) and 28.0 mm (east group) represented respective losses of 20.1%, 17.4% and 14.2% of growing-season rainfall. Increases in out-of-season rainfall in the respective groups of 31.0, 33.6, and 50.7 mm (57.8%, 60.8% and 87.6%) meant that annual rainfall changes were smaller than growing-season losses. The west and central groups lost 17.5 and 6.16 mm annual rainfall, whereas the east group gained 15.6 mm. Analysis of wheat yield indicated reductions of 13.5% (west) and 9.90% (central) in the eastern WA wheatbelt; the small group of east sites had a potential yield gain of 8.9% arising from the increased out-of-season rainfall. Further, increased out-of-season rainfall will exacerbate weed and disease growth over the summer fallow.

J	Sun, YY; Zhang, SQ; Chen, W				Sun, Yingying; Zhang, Suiqi; Chen, Wei			Root traits of dryland winter wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) from the 1940s to the 2010s in Shaanxi Province, China	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Eight cultivars of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) adapted to dryland conditions that have been historically planted in Shaanxi Province, China, were grown in plots with irrigation and drought treatments during the growing seasons of 2010-2012 to characterize the changes in root system traits and water use efficiency during the replacement of cultivars. The results showed that the overall root size of dryland wheat cultivars in Shaanxi Province changed with the planting decade. Modern cultivars developed after the 2000s had larger root surface areas than older cultivars under the drought treatment, especially at soil depths of 0-40 cm. However, the total water consumption throughout the stages showed no obvious changes among cultivars. The yield significantly increased with the planting decade, and the water use efficiency showed an average increase of 47.07% from the earliest to the most recent studied cultivar. Water stress promoted larger root sizes than those found in the irrigation treatment, especially at maturity. A trend toward a lower stress susceptibility index was observed over the decades, indicating that the sizes of modern cultivar roots increased less in the drought treatment than in the irrigation treatment. Both the roots and yields of the landrace cultivar from the 1940s showed low sensitivity to drought and better adjustment between the different water conditions. The study revealed that (1) modern wheat cultivars in Shaanxi Province possess higher water use efficiencies and decreased drought resilience and (2) the selection of ideal root traits should consider stable yields under different water conditions.						, Wei/0000-0001-7603-8222													2045-2322					MAR 24	2020	10	1							5328	10.1038/s41598-020-62170-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-62170-0								32210307					WOS:000563370200019

Previous studies have found that LSWT warming is occurring on a global scale and is expected to continue in the future. Recently, new global LSWT data products have been generated using satellite remote sensing, which provides an inimitable opportunity to study the LSWT response to global warming. Based on the satellite observations, we found that the warming rate of global lakes is uneven, with apparent regional differences. Indeed, comparing the LSWT warming in different climate zones (from arid to humid), the lakes in drylands experienced more significant warming (0.28 degrees C decade(-1)) than those in semi-humid and humid regions (0.19 degrees C decade(-1)) during previous decades (1995-2016). By further quantifying the impact factors, it showed that the LSWT warming is attributed to air temperature (74.4%), evaporation (4.1%), wind (9.9%), cloudiness (4.3%), net shortwave (3.1%), and net longwave (4.0%) over the lake surface. Air temperature is the main driving force for the warming of most global lakes, so the first estimate quantification of future LSWT trends can be determined from air temperature projections. By the end of the 21st century, the summer air temperature would warm up to 1.0 degrees C (SSP1-2.6) and 6.3 degrees C (SSP5-8.5) over lakes, with a more significant warming trend over the dryland lakes. Combined with their higher warming sensitivity, the excess summer LSWT warming in drylands is expected to continue, which is of great significance because of their high relevance in these water-limited regions.					ji, fei/IUM-5818-2023; He, Yongli/G-4498-2018; Piccolroaz, Sebastiano/AAJ-7627-2021; Guan, Xiaodan/K-6425-2016	ji, fei/0000-0002-7985-1558; He, Yongli/0000-0002-0183-378X; Piccolroaz, Sebastiano/0000-0003-1796-7624; Guan, Xiaodan/0000-0003-3716-4503; Wang, Bin/0000-0003-0453-458X														2072-4292				JAN	2022	14	1							86	10.3390/rs14010086	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14010086													WOS:000751383800001

Intraspecific trait variation in a dryland tree species corresponds to regional climate gradients	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Intraspecific trait variation is fundamental to understanding a species' adaptive capacity. Assessing phenotypic variation at different ecological scales is useful for evaluating species' vulnerability to changing environmental conditions. Here, we quantify the ecological scale of variation of phenotypic functional traits for a widespread dryland tree species and evaluate the strength of trait-environment relationships across spatial gradients and in response to interannual variability in weather conditions. Location Western United States. Taxon Conifer tree (Pinaceae): Pinus monophylla. Methods Nine reproductive and foliar morphological traits were measured from 23 sampling locations in nine mountain ranges, stratified across broad-scale gradients of precipitation timing and quantity and local gradients of elevation. We partitioned trait variation within and among nested ecological scales (mountain range, site, tree, and tree growth year). We then used multivariate methods to quantify the association between environmental variables and ecological trade-offs associated with both reproductive and foliar traits. Results Most variation was explained at the scale of individual trees (18%-46%) and between growth years (20%-30%), with smaller but variable contributions at the scale of sites (8%-25%) and mountain ranges (0%-15%). Trait values had low correlation with environmental variables (13%); however, 94% of the trait-environment covariance was explained by two major axes of variation: (1) the drought-stress gradient covarying with reproductive traits, and (2) precipitation patterns covarying with foliar morphology. Main conclusions High levels of individual trait variation indicate within-population adaptive capacity. Consistent relationships among range-wide patterns of foliar and reproductive traits and broad-scale climate gradients provide indirect evidence of local adaptation and may inform seed sourcing for restoration or the potential for assisted migration efforts. Quantification of intraspecific trait variation across multiple ecological scales is important for understanding the potential climate change response of dryland tree species.

Outdoor malaria vector species profile in dryland ecosystems of Kenya	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Outdoor biting by anopheline mosquitoes is one of the contributors to residual malaria transmission, but the profile of vectors driving this phenomenon is not well understood. Here, we studied the bionomics and genetically characterized populations of An. gambiae and An. funestus complexes trapped outdoors in three selected dryland areas including Kerio Valley, Nguruman and Rabai in Kenya. We observed a higher abundance of Anopheles funestus group members (n = 639, 90.6%) compared to those of the An. gambiae complex (n = 66, 9.4%) with An. longipalpis C as the dominant vector species with a Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite rate (Pfsp) of 5.2% (19/362). The known malaria vectors including An. funestus s.s. (8.7%, 2/23), An. gambiae (14.3%, 2/14), An. rivulorum (14.1%, 9/64), An. arabiensis (1.9%, 1/52) occurred in low densities and displayed high Pfsp rates, which varied with the site. Additionally, six cryptic species found associated with the An. funestus group harbored Pf sporozoites (cumulative Pfsp rate = 7.2%, 13/181). We detected low frequency of resistant 119F-GSTe2 alleles in An. funestus s.s. (15.6%) and An. longipalpis C (3.1%) in Kerio Valley only. Evidence of outdoor activity, emergence of novel and divergent vectors and detection of mutations conferring metabolic resistance to pyrethroid/DDT could contribute to residual malaria transmission posing a threat to effective malaria control.

To contribute to this debate, we examine a terrace complex representing an extended family agricultural land plot in the Kula dryland field system of East Maui, Hawaiian Islands. Botanical, faunal, soil, and architectural analysis data reveal a variety of household labor practices related to agroforestry ca. a.d. 1400-1820. A pre-human open forest soil substrate was replaced with stone agricultural terracing which was in turn enclosed by upslope-downslope garden walls that parceled the terrace complex into distinct garden areas. These results lead us to conclude that a wide range of specialized upland activities were practiced, including food cultivation, forestry, pig husbandry, and bird-hunting. The net sum of these local activities helped underpin the formative process of larger regional-level agricultural systems which in turn can inform us about polity-level staple and wealth finance systems.																			0093-4690	2042-4582				NOV 17	2023	48	8					623	636		10.1080/00934690.2023.2263698	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00934690.2023.2263698		OCT 2023											WOS:001082715400001

Nitrogen Fertilizer and Residue Management in Dryland No-Till Hard Red Spring Wheat	AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES & ENVIRONMENT												Core IdeasNitrogen may enhance wheat grain quality even when wheat yield is not increased.Nitrogen rate and placement had greater effect on grain protein than wheat yield.Side-banding N resulted in higher grain protein than broadcasting.Residue management had no effect on wheat production.This article summarizes the results from a 1-yr field experiment conducted at two locations in northcentral Montana. Nutrient and residue management are important aspects of dryland no-till cropping systems that directly affect wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production. The objectives were to assess N response of hard red spring wheat grown in dryland no-till conditions under varied crop residue management. The effects of N application rate (0, 135, and 270 kg N ha(-1)) and placement (broadcast vs. side-banded) and residue management (undisturbed vs. removed) on biomass weight and N content, Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI), grain yield, grain test weight, and protein content of hard red spring wheat were evaluated. At one of two locations, the 135 kg N ha(-1) rate resulted in significantly higher yield, compared with unfertilized check, but further increase of N rate to 270 kg N ha(-1) did not improve yield. There was no response of grain yield to N application rate at the second location. At one of two locations, the side-dress N application resulted in higher wheat yield, but no statistically significant differences in yield associated with N placement was observed at the second location. Biomass N content and grain protein content were significantly affected by the N application rate at both locations. The results of this study confirm that even if wheat grain yields are not always increased with N applications, N fertilizer could still be beneficial in terms of improved grain quality (test weight and protein content).																				2639-6696					2019	2	1								10.2134/age2019.09.0077	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/age2019.09.0077													WOS:001009059700010

A single nitrogen application maintains wheat yield and quality in dryland Mediterranean Vertisol	SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT												In dryland Mediterranean Vertisols, split nitrogen (N) application is usual in wheat crops. Because of the high clay content of these soils and the low rainfall, a single application might offer ecological and economic benefits without yield loss. We conducted a 5-year study as part of a long-term experiment and compared the split application of N (50% at tillering, 50% at stem elongation phase) with a single application (tillering) in 10 cropping systems resulting from the combination of type of cultivation (no-till and conventional tillage) and 2-year crop rotations (wheat-wheat, wheat-fallow, wheat-chickpea, wheat-faba bean and wheat-sunflower). Depending on the system x crop rotation interaction, a single application of 100 or 150 kg N ha-1 maintained grain yield, protein content and apparent N recovery, with no effect on nitrate content compared with a traditional split application. The average grain yield did not differ between split and single application of N (3.27 and 3.23 Mg ha-1, respectively, for single and split application of 100 kg N ha-1 rate; 3.46 and 3.40 Mg ha-1, respectively, for single and split application of 150 kg N ha-1 rate). The soil nitrate concentration at pre-seeding in the 0-0.3 m layer showed similar results, except in the case of the wheat-faba rotation, with lower nitrate concentration in the sub-subplots of single application and no-till. This work shows that adopting the single N application strategy in rotations on Mediterranean dryland Vertisols will reduce economic and environmental costs.																			0266-0032	1475-2743				2023 OCT 15	2023										10.1111/sum.12975	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sum.12975		OCT 2023											WOS:001083825000001

Ultimately, this leads to their aridification and desertification, that is, to simplified and barren ecosystems (with proportionally less microbial load and diversity) with altered functions and food webs and modification of microbial community network. Thus, preserving and restoring soil health in such a fragile biome could help buffer climate change's effects. We argue that microorganisms and the protection of their functional properties and networks are key to fight desertification. Specifically, we claim that it is rational, possible and certainly practical to rely on native dryland edaphic microorganisms and microbial communities as well as dryland plants and their associated microbiota to conserve and restore soil health and mitigate soil depletion in newly aridified lands. Furthermore, this will meet the objective of protecting/stabilizing (and even enhancing) soil biodiversity globally. Without urgent conservation and restoration actions that take into account microbial diversity, we will ultimately, and simply, not have anything to protect anymore.

However, long-term continuous mono-tillage including conservational and conventional tillage has been proved to have limited improvements or some defects on soil structure and nutrients enhancement. Combining different tillage practices in a rational rotation that adapts to the cropping system may optimize the advantages and improve the potentials of mono-tillage practices. Soil porosity, aggregates, water, organic carbon, nitrogen and crop yield were investigated in a ten-year (2007-2016) long-term conventional with conservation tillage rotation experiment which contained four tillage systems, NT (no-tillage), ST (subsoiling), CT (conventional tillage), and NCS rotation (no-tillage, conventional tillage and subsoiling rotated annually) in a dryland field to assess the soil pore system, aggregates, nutrients content and productivity. Compared with three mono-tillage systems (NT, ST and CT), the NCS rotation significantly decreased soil bulk density by 3.8-8.4 % and increased soil porosity by 3.2-6.7 % (P < 0.05) after ten years. NCS rotation increased soil capillary porosity by 9.7-36.3 %, reduced inactive porosity by 4-8.1 % when compared to continuous mono-tillage (NT, ST and CT), optimized soil porosity distribution at 0-60 cm soil depth till the tenth year. Meanwhile, compared with mono-tillage, NCS rotation improved soil macroaggregates content (0.25-5 mm) by 35.2-46.4 % and resulted in 40.3-113 % higher macroaggregates content than ten years before at 0-40 cm soil depth (P < 0.05). As the experiment continues, soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (TN) at different tillage systems accumulated at rates of 1.65-2.01 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) and 0.14-0.21 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) respectively, NCS rotation resulted in the highest soil nutrients accumulation (SOC: 57.98 Mg ha(-1), TN: 6.40 Mg ha(-1)), better soil nutrients distribution and suitable C/N (9.01) for crop growth and soil enhancement. Additionally, NCS rotation conserved more soil water in fallow period (394 mm) and during crop growth season (winter wheat: 352 mm, spring maize: 384 mm), produced higher winter wheat (5169 kg ha(-1)) and spring maize yield (8251 kg ha(-1)). The long-term rotational research showed that NCS rotation optimized soil structure (soil porosity, soil aggregates) and enhanced soil nutrients (SOC, TN), provided better soil conditions for crop production in dryland rain-fed farming agriculture.					wang, xu/IAN-4886-2023; liu, jiaming/IWE-3196-2023; zhang, xueying/JMB-7808-2023; Chen, Shuo/JEO-6350-2023; Li, June/JEF-1173-2023; Li, Zilong/JEZ-8642-2023; wang, xiao/HZI-9156-2023; wang, zhenhui/JMQ-0550-2023; Wang, Xuezhen/IUN-6267-2023														1161-0301	1873-7331				NOV	2021	131								126379	10.1016/j.eja.2021.126379	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2021.126379		SEP 2021											WOS:000697097500002

A simultaneous assessment of biocrusts and mycorrhizal fungi	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are communities of soil organisms often targeted to assist in the achievement of multiple ecological restoration goals. In drylands, benefits conferred from biocrust and AM fungal inoculation, such as improved native plant establishment and soil stabilization, have primarily been studied separately. However, comparisons between these two types of soil inoculants and investigations into potential synergies between them, particularly at the plant community scale, are needed to inform on-the-ground management practices in drylands. We conducted two full-factorial experiments-one in greenhouse mesocosms and one in field plots-to test the effects of AM fungal inoculation, biocrust inoculation, and their interaction on multiple measures of dryland restoration success. Biocrust inoculation promoted soil stabilization and plant drought tolerance, but had mixed effects on native plant diversity (positive in greenhouse, neutral in field) and productivity (negative in greenhouse, neutral in field). In greenhouse mesocosms, biocrust inoculation reduced plant biomass, which was antagonistic to % root length colonized by AM fungi. Inoculation with native or commercial AM fungi did not influence plant establishment, drought tolerance, or soil stabilization in either study, and few synergistic effects of simultaneous inoculation of AM fungi and biocrusts were observed. These results suggest that, depending on the condition of existing soil communities, inoculation with AM fungi may not be necessary to promote dryland restoration goals, while inoculation with salvaged biocrust inoculation may be beneficial in some contexts.

Wheat is considered one of the most strategic products in food security. Dryland farming of wheat is prevalent in many parts of the world, and it occupies a large part of the cultivated land. However, its performance is highly dependent on weather conditions and changes. Yield prediction models could be used for planning purposes when dealing with changes in yield. This study analyzed the effectiveness of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model in selecting variables for predicting dryland wheat yield in southwestern Iran. The model was used with 45 weather-based variables across annual, seasonal, and monthly time frames. The results showed that temperature, evaporation, and extreme temperatures followed by radiation and precipitation variables categories, are effective meteorological variables in estimating dryland farming wheat yield in the study area. Monthly timescale could estimate yield with minimum error compared to other timescales. However, considering all selected variables regardless of their timescale (total) results, the best estimation in most districts with the model's R-2 and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) varied between 57.98-99.50 and 1.46-21.94, respectively. Therefore, the LASSO regression could be used reliably for each district considering the most effective meteorological parameters in that region for accurate decision-makers policies.

Hillslope to channel hydrologic connectivity in a dryland ecosystem	ECOSPHERE												Hydrologic connectivity refers to the processes and thresholds leading to water transport across a landscape. In dryland ecosystems, runoff production is mediated by the arrangement of vegetation and bare soil patches on hillslopes and the properties of ephemeral channels. In this study, we used runoff measurements at multiple scales in a small (4.67 ha) mixed shrubland catchment of the Chihuahuan Desert to identify controls on and thresholds of hillslope-channel connectivity. By relating short- and long-term hydrologic records, we also addressed whether observed changes in outlet discharge since 1977 were linked to modifications in hydrologic connectivity. Hillslope runoff production was controlled by the maximum rainfall intensity occurring in a 30-min interval (I-30), with small-to-negligible effects of antecedent surface soil moisture, vegetation cover, or slope aspect. An I-30 threshold of nearly 10 mm/h activated runoff propagation from the shrubland hillslopes and through the main ephemeral channel, whereas an I-30 threshold of about 16 mm/h was required for discharge from the catchment outlet. Since storms rarely exceed I-30, full hillslope-channel connectivity occurs infrequently in the mixed shrubland, leading to <2% of the annual precipitation being converted into outlet discharge. Progressive decreases in outlet discharge since 1977 could not be explained by variations in precipitation metrics, including I-30, or the process of woody plant encroachment. Instead, channel modifications from the buildup of sediment behind measurement flumes may have increased transmission losses and reduced outlet discharge. Thus, alterations in channel properties can play an important role in the long-term (45-year) variations of rainfall-runoff dynamics of small desert catchments.

We draw connections between the geometry of the spot and gap solutions with that of traveling and stationary front solutions in the same model. In particular, we demonstrate the instability of spots of large radius by deriving an asymptotic relationship between a critical eigenvalue associated with the spot and a coefficient which encodes the sideband instability of a nearby stationary front. Furthermore, we demonstrate that spots are unstable to a range of perturbations of intermediate wavelength in the angular direction, provided the spot radius is not too small. Our results are accompanied by numerical simulations and spectral computations.

Strategic Tillage Effects on Crop Yields, Soil Properties, and Weeds in Dryland No-Tillage Systems	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Long-term no-till (NT) systems in the semiarid central Great Plains of the United States require flexible management strategies to minimize the impacts of herbicide resistant (HR) kochia (Kochia scoparia L.) and tumble windmill grass (Chloris verticillata Nutt.) as well as nutrient stratification on soil and crop productivity. This study examined strategic tillage (ST) to control HR weeds and improve crop yields in an otherwise long-term NT cropping system. Treatments were three crop rotations: (1) continuous winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (WW); (2) wheat-fallow (WF); and (3) wheat-grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.)-fallow (WSF); as main plots. Subplots were reduced tillage (RT), continuous NT, and ST of NT. Results showed ST and RT treatments provided significant control of HR weeds. Soil water content at wheat planting was significantly less with RT compared to NT or ST. Strategic tillage did not affect wheat or grain sorghum yields, but RT decreased sorghum yields by 15% compared to NT. Increasing cropping intensity reduced wheat yields. Strategic tillage reduced bulk density and had no effect on aggregate size distribution or mean weight diameter (MWD) compared to NT though RT reduced the proportion of large macroaggregates and MWD. Similarly, ST compared to NT had no effect on soil organic carbon (SOC) or nitrogen (N) concentrations. Soil phosphorus (P) was not different among the tillage treatments though RT increased potassium (K) concentration near the soil surface. The SOC, MWD, and micronutrient availability were greatest with WW though it had significantly lower pH and K concentration. Our results suggest ST could provide a mitigation option for HR weeds in NT systems with little impact on crop yields and soil properties.

In dryland river systems, floodplain inundation is infrequent and irregular, and wetlands consist of discrete and unstable habitat patches. In these systems, life history strategies such as long-distance dispersal, seed longevity, self-fertilisation, and reproduction from vegetative propagules are important strategies that allow plants to persist. Using two aquatic plants, Marsilea drummondii and Eleocharis acuta, we investigated the proportions of sexual and asexual reproduction and self-fertilisation by employing next-generation sequencing approaches, and we used this information to understand the population genetic structure of a large inland floodplain in western New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Asexual vegetative reproduction and self-fertilisation were more common in M. drummondii, but both species used sexual reproduction as the main mode of reproduction. This resulted in a highly differentiated genetic structure between wetlands and a similar genetic structure within wetlands. The similarity in genetic structure was influenced by the wetland in the two species, highlighting the influence of the floodplain landscape and hydrology on structuring population genetic structure. The high levels of genetic variation among wetlands and the low variation within wetlands suggests that dispersal and pollination occur within close proximity and that gene flow is restricted. This suggests a reliance on locally sourced (persistent) seed, rather than asexual (clonal) reproduction or recolonisation via dispersal, for the population maintenance of plants in dryland rivers. This highlights the importance of floodplain inundation to promote seed germination, establishment, and reproduction in dryland regions.

Soil and crop management systems that ameliorate damage caused by decades of dryland agroecosystem mismanagement	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Sustainable crop production in the Great Plains of North America has been challenging since early settlement times, and mismanagement has severely damaged our dryland agroecosystems. The unintentional damage stemmed from using practices unsuited to dryer climates. In fact, the management practices imported from more humid agricultural areas during the settlement period were considered the best ways to farm. The Dust Bowl era was the disastrous result of creating bare soil surfaces, with aggregates pulverized by excessive tillage on millions of hectares of land. It became obvious to pioneer scientists that retaining cover on the soil surface was critical to sustainability and their early efforts resulted in a widely adopted practice known as stubble mulch. Stubble mulch practices markedly decreased the rate of damage to dryland ecosystems. Advent of herbicidal weed control led to reduced and no-till practices that not only increased soil cover, but also significantly enhanced soil water conservation. This paper focuses on how and why the coupling of conservation tillage and cropping intensification is ameliorating the damage that accrued over decades of agroecosystem mismanagement. The objectives of this paper are to (a) remind us of fragile nature of the Great Plains ecosystem, (b) review how and why ecosystems were degraded, and (c) identify principles and associated practices for amelioration.

This research evaluated the efficiency of fungicides in the treatment of pre-germinated and dryland rice seeds in the control of M. albescens. Seeds of the cultivars, Epagri 109, SCS116 Satoru, SCS121 CL and SCS122 Miura were treated with the following fungicides (g a.i./100 kg of seeds): fluazinam + thiophanate methyl (9.45 + 63), pyraclostrobin + thiophanate methyl (5 + 45), carboxin + thiram (60 + 60), metalaxyl-M + thiabendazole + fludioxonil (3 + 22.5 + 3.75), carbendazim + thiram (45 + 105), carbendazim (45). Seeds without fungicide treatment constituted the control. The treated seeds were sown in potato-sucroseagar (PSA) culture medium and incubated at 25 +/- 2 degrees C and photoperiod of 12 hours for 14 days. Treated seeds were also submitted to the germination test. Fluazinam + thiophanate methyl and metalaxyl-M + thiabendazole + fludioxonil showed greater control of M. albescens, not differing statistically between them, in the five cultivars and in the two cultivation systems. The tested fungicides provided seed germination above 90% in the four cultivars.

Participatory sorghum technologies evaluation was thus initiated to compare dryland sorghum technologies (Misikir and Girana-1) against the local practice in a wider scale, comprising 450 farmers from marginal districts of Wag-lasta. The agronomic, economic and preference data were collected and analysed in descriptive statistic, ANOVA, partial budgeting and weighted ranking matrix. The combined result indicated that Misikir, Girana-1 and the local sorghum provided mean grain yields of 2.9, 1.6 and 1.5 ton ha(-1), respectively. Accordingly, Misikir technology has 81.3% and 93.3% yield advantage over Girana-1 and the local, respectively. The marginal rate of return (MRR) of Misikir is 477.6% but insignificant for Girana-1 by the cost higher than the local practice. The weighted ranking matrix also shows that Misikir was preferred by its earliness, seed setting performance, grain and biomass yields. Dissemination of Misikir technology is thus safely recommended. The finding further revealed that technological recommendations using on-station plot trials is dwarfing the adoption rates since farmers would hesitate to uptake as if they did not evaluate the technologies on their local context. The paper concludes that scale wide farmers' participation is vital future experiments for sustainable and demand-driven technology development and diffusion on top of providing feedback to the concerned agricultural scientists.																			2331-1932					OCT 4	2019	5	1							1671114	10.1080/23311932.2019.1671114	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2019.1671114													WOS:000490129800001

The conversion affects soil ecological stability, especially the most active soil microorganisms. However, the impacts of the dryland-to-paddy conversion has paid little attention in recent decades. In this study, a pot experiment was used to explore the responses of the microbial community and their interactions with soil properties after rice in the first season (five months). The results indicated that a significant decrease in the topsoil pH, organic matter content, nitrate nitrogen, and ammonical nitrogen, and an increase in soil electrical conductivity (EC) was observed (p < 0.05) after the dryland-to-paddy conversion. The richness and diversity of bacteria and fungi decreased in the short term. The composition of the soil microbial community and the soil microbial dominant bacteria had considerably changed after the conversion. Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Olpidiomycota were found to be highly sensitive to the dryland-to-paddy conversion. The soil microbial community structure had extremely significant positive correlations with soil pH, EC, organic matter, nitrate nitrogen, and ammonical nitrogen (p < 0.05). Microorganisms are the most important component of soil nutrient cycling. Converting a large area of dryland to paddy may lead to an imbalance in the soil carbonitride cycle and should be further examined in North China.

Previous studies have investigated ET partitioning across sites and plants; however, direct comparisons of water consumption before and after the transition from one crop to another are scarce. The variation in and proportion of ET and its subcomponents as well as the change in soil water storage (SWS) were compared in maize (Zea mays L.) croplands and apple (Malus domestica auct. non Borkh. cv. Fuji) orchards in four active (approximately May to September) and three inactive growth periods on the southern Loess Plateau, China. Soil water evaporation (E-s) accounted for 36.3 and 37.7% of the total ET for cropland and orchard, respectively, in the active growth period. The canopy interception (I-c) significantly differed between cropland and orchard. The mean I-c/ET for cropland and orchard was 23.1 and 22.7%, respectively, in the active growth period, showing that the effects of I-c on ET partitioning should not be ignored. The mean ratio of transpiration (T) to ET for cropland was 2.8% less than that for orchard during the active growth period. The T/ET of cropland peaked twice in each active growth period. Precipitation (P) met the water consumption requirements of crop growth in the active growth period. The ET of cropland and orchard in the inactive growth period accounted for 29.4 and 31.8% of the ET for the hydrological year, respectively. These results help assess water consumption and soil sustainability under changes in crops in dryland agricultural ecosystems.

The concentration and type of DOM within rivers depends on the relative contributions of allochthonous sources and the production and consumption of DOM by microbes. In this work we have examined the temporal patterns in DOM quality and productivity in three lowland rivers in dryland Australia using fluorescence excitation emission scans. We assessed the production and consumption of DOM within light and dark bottle assays to quantify the relative contribution of bacteria and algae to the DOM pool and simultaneously assessed whether the systems were autotrophic or heterotrophic. DOM varied temporally within the three river systems over the course of the study period. Characterisation of DOM within light and dark bottles following a 6-hour incubation revealed microbial consumption of a humic-like component and production of protein-like components similar in nature to the amino acids tryptophan and tyrosine. The lack of a significant difference in DOM quality between the light and dark bottles indicated that the protein-like DOM is likely derived from bacterial activity. Respiration was shown to be higher than gross primary production in both whole river and bottle assays, yielding negative net production values and demonstrating that these rivers were predominately heterotrophic. Our work suggests that bacterial metabolism of DOM may be a significant contributor to the production of protein-like components within heterotrophic freshwater systems. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In a study of AM fungal communities and their relationship with soil chemical characteristics, we used a high-throughput sequencing technique to explore AM fungal diversity and community composition in different habitats across Qatar. We identified a total of 79 AM fungal taxa, over 77% of which were species from the Glomeraceae family. The lowest AM fungal diversity was observed in saltmarsh and in one rawdha site, while the highest richness, effective number of species, and diversity were observed in rawdha and sabkha communities. NMDS and multiple regression analyses showed that AM fungi were negatively correlated with soil pH and TC, but positively correlated with K and NO3-. AM fungi also were positively correlated with Cd, with the latter suggesting that very low levels of heavy metals may not always be harmful to AM fungi. These findings provide baseline information on AM fungal assemblages and the chemical drivers of diversity across communities in Qatar. This work partly compensates for the current lack of broad-scale studies in the Arabian Peninsula by providing understanding of overall patterns of AM fungi and their drivers in the region.

Despite the demonstrated benefits of cyanobacterial inoculation for promoting soil fertility, there is limited knowledge about the impacts of introducing cultured cyanobacteria on the indigenous microbial communities. Here, we conducted a microcosm experiment under controlled conditions using indigenous biocrust cyanobacteria and locally sourced topsoil substrate commonly used in dryland restoration in the Australian arid zone. We inoculated the topsoil with a consortium composed of Leptolyngbya sp. and Scytonema sp. cyanobacteria, to assess the effects of the inoculated cyanobacteria on (i) the soil chemical properties, i.e., pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total organic carbon (TOC), and nitrogen (TN) of the inoculated topsoil, (ii) the early formation of an artificial soil biocrust and iii) the composition and diversity of the resident bacterial community. Our results showed that the inoculated cyanobacterial consortia decreased the EC, but changes in the TOC and TN were not significant after 80 days. A higher content of chlorophyll a in the inoculated samples compared to the control, confirmed the survival of the cyanobacterial inoculants after 80 days. The inoculated cyanobacteria promoted gypsum formation on the soil surface indicating that they are actively modifying the upper layers of the soil profile and improving habitability. Although immediately after inoculation cyanobacteria dominated the abundance of bacterial phylotypes, these were replaced by other phyla such as Actinobacteria, after 80 days. The Shannon diversity and Simpson diversity indexes between control and inoculated soils differed at the time of inoculation but were similar at the end of the experiment. These results suggest that, in the short term, the introduced cyanobacteria do not significantly affect the native resident bacterial communities and are capable of colonizing the topsoil without affecting the natural community.

NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Recruitment failure of native plants is common in dryland ecosystems in New Zealand. We investigated whether herbicide control of invasive grasses or restoration of either shrub cover or the natural disturbance regime (river gravel deposition after flooding) can promote seedling establishment of the critically endangered shrub Olearia adenocarpa and two common species also found in river floodplain ecosystems (Carmichaelia australis and Sophora microphylla). Olearia adenocarpa seedlings have been observed only after invasive grasses were controlled with herbicide and when browsing mammals were also excluded. We used a field experiment to compare seedling establishment in four treatments: (1) shade cloth shelters, a proxy for native shrub cover; (2) river gravel addition, to simulate gravel deposition during flooding; (3) herbicide application, to kill invasive grasses; (4) untreated controls. For C. australis, provision of shade and shelter (hereafter referred to as shade) and herbicide application both promoted seedling emergence compared to controls, but few seedlings survived after two years. For O. adenocarpa, we found weak evidence that shade, herbicide and gravel increased seedling emergence, but the effects were small and few seeds germinated. Establishment of S. microphylla seedlings was unaffected by shade, but gravel and herbicide treatments reduced seedling emergence compared to controls. Seed germination was also low for S. microphylla. During a drought in the second spring, soil moisture was higher in all treatments than in untreated controls. Soil moisture was lower in gravel plots than in untreated controls at all other times. Shade also increased soil moisture in the first spring. The effects of herbicide on soil moisture were variable. Our findings indicate that the loss of native shrublands and invasion by non-native grasses limits the establishment of C. australis seedlings in dryland river floodplains, and that the effects of these changes are not easily overcome. While O. adenocarpa seedlings cannot compete with invasive grasses, other factors also limited recruitment of this species, and S. microphylla, in this study.

However, little is known about the quantitative characteristics and formation of NRWIs, and the relative importance of NRWIs as water sources in a dryland jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) plantation in the Hilly Loess Region of China. The objectives of this study were to determine the characteristics of NRWIs during the jujube growing season with regard to amount, duration, and contributions to transpiration, evaporation, and evapotranspiration. Dew intensity and duration were monitored using dielectric leaf wetness sensors, Also sap flow, soil water content, soil temperature, and meteorological variables were measured during the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons. NRWIs were found to be composed of canopy dew (CD) and water vapor adsorption (WVAS) in the 0-5 cm soil layer, amounting to 75.218 mm in 2017 and 75.309 mm in 2018 (CD accounted for about 81% of NRWI). Daily average CD was significantly greater than WVAS (P < 0.05), and CD duration was 2.09-9.14 h more than WVAS duration (P < 0.05). The CD rate and frequency generally exceeded that of WVAS. CD occurred from 19:00 to 9:00. WVAS mainly occurred from 6:30 to 9:00. CD reduced nocturnal sap flow by 7.36-55.64%, but increased soil water storage (in the 5-100 cm root zone) by 0.274-0.717 mm. WVAS had no effect on soil water evaporation. Over the entire growing season, the ratio of CD to total transpiration was 0.218 in 2017 and 0.258 in 2018, and the ratio of WVAS to soil water evaporation was 0.082 in both years. NRWIs occurred more frequently and were quantitatively more stable than rainfall events. Their contributions to evapotranspiration reached a maximum value of 0.184 in 2018. NRWIs are important components of the hydrological cycle in this region, and probably have potential positive ecological effects on dryland jujube plantations in the Hilly Loess Region of China.

Effect of Sheep Grazing, Stocking Rates and Dolomitic Limestone Application on the Floristic Composition of a Permanent Dryland Pasture, in the Montado Agroforestry System of Southern Portugal	ANIMALS												Simple Summary The Montado is a characteristic ecosystem of the Mediterranean region, where agricultural activities, animal production and forestry coexist alongside tourism, hunting and leisure activities. Animal grazing is fundamental for the conservation of the Montado, and it is imperative to clearly understand its interactions with the pasture floristic composition (PFC) of the Montado. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of sheep grazing, stocking rates and dolomitic limestone application on the floristic composition of permanent dryland pastures, in the Montado agroforestry system of Southern Portugal. The type of grazing influences the PFC, which may be positively or negatively impacted, depending on the adopted system. Deferred grazing seems to benefit the disappearance of undesirable plants and the appearance of desired plants. The results of this study allow for more informed management decisions and a potential increase in animal production but also improve the knowledge of conservation strategies in the Montado. The Montado is a complex agroforestry-pastoral ecosystem due to the interactions between soil-pasture-trees-animals and climate. The typical Montado soil has an acidic pH and manganese toxicity, which affect the pasture's productivity and pasture floristic composition (PFC). The PFC, on the other hand, can also be influenced by the type and intensity of grazing, which can lead to significant decreases in the amount of biomass produced and the biodiversity of species in the pasture. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of grazing type, by sheep, and different stocking rates on the PFC throughout the vegetative pasture cycle in areas with and without dolomitic limestone application. Thus, four treatments (P1UC to P4TC) were constituted: P1UC-without limestone application (U) and continuous grazing (CG); P2UD-U and deferred grazing (DG); P3TD-with the application of limestone (T) and DG; P4TC-T and CG. In DG plots, the placement and removal of the animals were carried out as a function of the average height of the pasture (placement-10 cm; removal-3 to 5 cm). The PFC was characterized in winter, at the peak of spring and in late spring. The PFC data were subjected to a multilevel pattern analysis (ISA). The combination of rainfall and temperature influenced the pasture growth rates and consequently the height of the pasture at different times of the year. Therefore, with the different growth rates of the pasture throughout the year, the sheep remain for different periods of time in the deferred grazing treatments. In the four treatments, 103 plant species were identified. The most representative botanical families in the four treatments were Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae. ISA identified 14 bioindicator species: eight for the winter period, three for the late spring vegetative period and three for the TC treatment.

Information on the bioavailability and forms of P following a one-time compost application in marginal organic agroecosystems with low and infrequent use of fertilizers is required to promote sustainability. The goal of this study was to evaluate changes in Hedley P pools following a one-time application of manure compost and its potential influence on short-term (3-yr) P bioavailability. Steer manure compost at 0, 25, and 50 Mg dry weight ha(-1) was applied to two organic dryland sites, Snowville and Blue Creek, with contrasting soil characteristics in northern Utah in a randomized complete block design. Potential phosphatase assays, a laboratory aerobic incubation study, and soil P fractionations were carried out to assess the transformation of P 1 and 3 yr after a one-time compost application. At 0-10 cm, compost application resulted in increased acid phosphatase at Snowville (67.3 vs. 42.7 mu g p-nitrophenol g(-1) soil, p = .003), while alkaline phosphatase increased at Blue Creek (124 vs. 49 mu g p-nitrophenol g(-1) soil, p = .0185). The path coefficient between compost P and Hedley labile inorganic P was significant at Snowville, but not at Blue Creek, suggesting that the pathways of P differed between the sites. The Hedley stable P pool was a sink of compost P at Snowville but a source at Blue Creek. In conclusion, our work shows that a one-time compost application had a differential effect on the variation in P dynamics in organic dryland winter wheat-fallow soils. The potential long-term benefits may be greater in semiarid soils with lower available P levels, higher carbonate levels and pH, and drier conditions.

Soil and soil organic carbon effects on simulated Southern High Plains dryland Cotton production	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												The effect of increasing soil organic content (SOC) on the soil water retention and cotton yield productivity of two benchmark U.S. Southern High Plains (SHP) soils was estimated using pedotransfer functions and the CROPGRO-Cotton crop simulation model. Increasing plow layer (0-30 cm) SOC leads to increased wilting point (WP), field capacity (FC), and plant available water capacity (PAW = FC-WP) in both soils. The increase in a clay loam's available water capacity is modest, with a 1% increase in SOC producing an additional 0.16 cm of PAW in the soil profile's uppermost 30 cm. The fine sandy loam's plow layer effect is twice that, with a 1% SOC increase producing a 0.32 cm PAW increase. These effect's magnitudes were consistent with a recent meta-analysis of SOC on soil water retention, but considerably below those cited by national and regional extension services. As surface SOC levels in both soils were increased above baseline levels the fine sandy loam's median simulated cotton lint yields were essentially unchanged, while clay loam yields decreased. The clay loam yield effect is attributed to increased soil evaporation rates. Conservation agriculture (CA) practices such as increased residue retention may compensate for these weak soil water retention effects, but cotton's limited residue production would require winter cover crops or alternate crop rotations. As the success of terminated winter wheat - dryland cotton rotations is unclear in past SHP field studies, a CA sorghum-cotton rotation with periodic tillage is proposed as a SHP dryland production system.

Scott; Bowness (Davidson), Robyne; Olson, Mark; Chatterton, Syama			Response of lentil cultivars to Sclerotinia white mold and Botrytis grey mold infection under irrigated and dryland conditions	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE												Diseases such as Sclerotinia white mold (SWM), caused by the fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary, and Botrytis grey mold (BGM), caused by the fungus Botrytis cinerea Pers., may be limiting factors for lentil production in wetter areas of Alberta, Canada. Field trials were conducted at the Lethbridge Research and Development Centre from 2013 to 2015 to evaluate the response of lentil cultivars to SWM and BGM and yield impacts. Ten lentil cultivars from five market classes were evaluated under irrigated and dryland plots with two planting densities (120 and 160 plants center dot m-2). Year and irrigation had the largest effect on disease incidence, with highest SWM incidence occurring under irrigation in 2013, followed by 2014 and 2015. Conversely, BGM incidence under irrigation was highest in 2015 and lowest in 2013, but levels were lower than SWM. Significantly (P < 0.05) lower disease incidences were observed in dryland plots, which also produced higher yield than irrigated plots. Cultivars varied significantly in SWM incidence and yield under irrigated and dryland conditions, perhaps due to variable disease pressure, but there was no consistent trend in cultivar performance. BGM incidence was similar in cultivars, but differed among years. These findings indicate that SWM may be a limiting factor to lentil produc-tion in wetter areas, as the 10 cultivars from five market classes tested were all highly susceptible to SWM.																			0008-4220	1918-1833				FEB	2022	102	1					225	233		10.1139/cjps-2020-0335	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjps-2020-0335													WOS:000754692500020

Biocrusts Modulate Responses of Nitrous Oxide and Methane Soil Fluxes to Simulated Climate Change in a Mediterranean Dryland	ECOSYSTEMS												Little is known about the role of biocrusts in regulating the responses of N2O and CH4 fluxes to climate change in drylands. Here, we aim to help filling this knowledge gap by using an 8-year field experiment in central Spain where temperature and rainfall are being manipulated (similar to 1.9 degrees C warming, 33% rainfall reduction and their combination) in areas with and without well-developed biocrust communities. Areas with initial high cover of well-developed biocrusts showed lower N2O emissions, enhanced CH4 uptake and higher abundances of functional genes linked to N2O and CH4 fluxes compared with areas with poorly developed biocrusts. Moreover, biocrusts modulated the responses of gases emissions and related functional genes to warming and rainfall reductions. Specifically, we found under rainfall exclusion and its combination with warming a sharp reduction in N2O fluxes (similar to 96% and similar to 197%, respectively) only under well-developed biocrust cover. Warming and its combination with rainfall exclusion reduced CH4 consumption in areas with initial low cover of well-developed biocrust, whereas rainfall exclusion enhanced CH4 uptake only in areas with high initial cover of well-developed biocrusts. Similarly, the combination of warming and rainfall exclusion increased the abundance of the nosZ gene compared to the rainfall exclusion treatment and increased the abundance of the pmoA gene compared to the control, but only in areas with low biocrust cover. Taken together, our results indicate that well-developed biocrust communities could counteract the impact of warming and altered rainfall patterns on soil N2O and CH4 fluxes, highlighting their importance and the need to preserve them to minimize climate change impacts on drylands.

J	Pérez, DR; Farinaccio, FM; Aronson, J				Perez, Daniel R.; Farinaccio, Fernando M.; Aronson, James			Towards a dryland framework species approach. Research in progress in the Monte Austral of Argentina	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												We discuss the strategies and early results from an ecological restoration and rehabilitation project underway in Monte Austral (Southern Monte) of Argentinian Patagonia. We use this as a platform to propose a dryland framework species approach (DFSA) to ecological restoration and rehabilitation (ERR). DFSA is based on the 'framework species approach' developed in mega-diverse tropical forest biomes of Australia and southern Asia over the past 20 years. We discuss how the approach could be adapted and modified to boost the impact of ERR and help achieve more effective recovery of biodiversity, ecosystem health, and human health and well-being in the vast dryland ecosystems of the world. In arid and semiarid ecosystems, not all native species respond well to methods for growing in nurserys, and a key to ERR success is the identification of a coherent set of species selected on the basis of multiple criteria, both ecological and practical, and simple tests for field performance. We describe selection criteria and early results of field trials of three candidate framework plant species undergoing field trials in our region. Of these three, Atriplex lampa and Hyalis argentea var. latisquama showed uniformly high performance while the response of Senecio subulatus var. subulatus varied according to substrates. We also discuss the use of drones, and other tools for both research and action in conjunction with DFSA.

Unfortunately, many restoration projects have failed in tropical drylands due to monoculture plantations or a lack of understanding regarding specific species requirements like shading. Therefore, the central question is whether species diversity and shading can improve seedling survival and vitality in dryland conditions. We conducted a tree diversity experiment in northern Ethiopia as part of the International Diversity Experiment Network with Trees (IDENT). We used 17,280 seedlings from 9 native dry Afromontane tree and shrub species, distributed across 270 plots in three replication blocks. Each block contains a shading treatment (shaded versus non-shaded) with three levels of species richness: one-, two- and four-species mixtures with varying levels of functional diversity (FD) categorized as low, medium, and high. Survival and vitality data of the seedlings were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) and linear mixed-effects models (LMMs). After two growing seasons, the overall seedling survival rate was 84%. We found significantly higher seedling survival, vitality, and chlorophyll content (SPAD value) in shaded conditions, irrespective of the tree diversity level. However, increasing species richness did improve seedling vitality in non-shaded conditions, but its impact diminished in shaded situations. The findings from this study suggest that careful selection of tree species, appropriate shading, and optimal levels of species diversity can greatly enhance the survival and performance of seedlings. This is particularly important for the successful restoration of dryland forests.

Britton in Dryland Forests in South Omo Zone, Ethiopia	SUSTAINABILITY												Senegalia senegal (L.) Britton is a multi-purpose dryland tree species that produces gum arabic, a commercially valuable product. However, this resource is underused in Ethiopian dryland areas. The aim of this study was to evaluate the population status and potential gum yield of S. senegal growing in natural stands in South Omo Zone, Ethiopia. Forty-five sample plots, each measuring 20 x 20 m, were established at 500 m intervals along transects, with 1 m(2) subplots located within the main plots to determine regeneration. S. senegal trees with a diameter at breast height of between 2 and 12 cm were most prevalent. Forty-two tree species were associated with S. senegal, of which 16 were gum- and resin-producing species. S. senegal was positively associated with Vachellia tortilis, Senegalia mellifera, Vachellia nilotica, Commiphora edulis, and Dobera glabra. Senegalia senegal comprised approximately 35% of regenerating trees. The maximum gum arabic yield obtained was 3948 g tree(-1). Linear models of dendrometric variables indicated that gum arabic yield is better predicted by tree diameter than by height. Despite the limitations of this pioneer survey, the population status and yield potential suggest that gum arabic could be sustainably produced and commercialized in natural stands of S. senegal in the studied dryland areas, providing local communities with supplementary seasonal incomes.

However, the variation of grain PAEs contents in different dryland areas is not clear, and the distribution of PAEs in different tissues of grains has not been studied yet. In the present study, field experiments in five sites (three provinces) with two treatments (soil with and without film mulching) were carried out to study the concentration and distribution of PAEs in grains and the effects of environmental factors on them. Results showed that the total PAE concentration ( n-ary sumation PAEs) in wheat grains ranged from 445 to 764 mu g/kg, mainly in the forms of di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP). Compared with control, total PAE concentrations in soils and wheat grains were significantly higher in treatments with film mulching. The effects of film on the proportion of PAEs in the flour and bran varied with experiment sites. Grain PAEs in the control groups presented significantly negative correlation with annual temperature, while there was a positive correlation between soil PAEs and bran PAEs in the film treatment. Results in this study are of great significance to comprehensively evaluate the effect of film mulching on grain safety in dryland wheat production.

Understanding of the nature of drought stress (i.e. drought pattern, DP) including its severity, timing and duration is required to deal with the negative impacts of drought on crop production. Drought patterns can be influenced by numerous factors including climatic, soil, and crop growth characteristics. Accordingly, a simulation modelling approach was applied in the current study to capture the characteristics of DPs and their long-term impact on wheat grain yield in dryland cropping systems of north-west Iran. Results showed that light drought patterns (DP1 and 2) were characterized by higher grain yield (3 t ha-1), biomass (10.6 t ha-1), LAI at flowering (2.1), cumulative rainfall from floral initiation to maturity stages (122.6), and cumulative transpiration (158.6 mm), as compared to severe drought patterns (DP3 and DP4). This is mainly because of a lower mean and minimum water supply/demand ratio (sdr) that occurs in severe DPs (0.8 and 0.06, respectively) compared to light DPs (0.92 and 0.22, respectively). Results also indicated that the occurrence of DP4 (53.5%) was dominant across all the dryland study regions while the lowest frequency was simulated for DP3 (3.5%). As drought is frequently happening in the dryland environments through various patterns (i.e. DPs), farmers should understand the patterns of drought that occur in their own regions, and the seasonal climatic characteristics of these drought pattern. Based on the results, it is recommended that (1) farmers sow dryland wheat genotypes that are highly tolerant to drought during their grain filling period for DP4; (2) sow genotypes that have high drought tolerant during vegetative stages for DP3, and (3) use late-maturing genotypes that absorb radiation for a longer period and thus increase photosynthesis and grain yield to take advantage of the optimal environmental conditions under both DP1 and DP2.

The paper analyses property right issues and institutional arrangements of a rural man-made wetland in dryland areas of West Bengal, India. It uses Participatory Rural Appraisal, Key-Informant's Interview, Focus Group Discussion, and household interview to accomplish this objective. The wetland, being located in the dryland landscape, serves as the primary freshwater source for surrounding communities and is used for multiple purposes. However, the conflict among the stakeholders on property right has caused the dissolution of the traditional local institution. Lack of regulation on water and fish extraction from the wetland affected essential human activities like household use, irrigation, and fishery. Moreover, conflict among the stakeholders adversely eroded any form of collective action for maintenance and renovation of the wetland. The study suggests that decentralized conflict resolution through dialogue is the pre-requisite for encouraging collective action and development of institutional arrangements which are vital for the restoration and sustainable utilization of the wetland.

The impact of intensive farming systems on groundwater availability in dryland environments: A watershed level study from Telangana, India	CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY												Intensification of agriculture in India has increased food self-sufficiency. However, it has also led to unwanted environmental impacts, particularly the increased pressure on groundwater resources. These impacts are most severe in the dryland regions of the country. Therefore, this paper aims to understand the impact of intensified forms of agriculture on the availability of water resources in a dryland watershed in Telangana, India. To achieve this, we first assessed the water use of three main farming systems in the study region. We then calculated the water balance at the watershed level to understand the agricultural impact on groundwater availability within the watershed. The three farming systems studied were the crop without livestock system (CWL; 48% of households), the crop-dairy system (CD; 38% of households), and the crop with small ruminants system (CSR; 6% of households). The results indicated that the CD system used the highest quantity of water (19,668 m3/ household/y), followed by the CSR (8645 m3/household/y) and CWL (4403 m3/household/y). CWL and CD systems comprise 86% of the households, making these systems the largest water users. Finally, the water bal-ance of the whole watershed showed a deficit of - 13.9 Mm3/y. Cultivation of water-demanding non-dryland crops, increased specialization of farming systems, and management practices in current farming systems are the factors causing over-utilization of water and subsequent groundwater depletion. We also realize that the current policy environment and other drivers such as decreasing landholdings and market forces, also induce increased water use in production. We, therefore, conclude that there is a need to promote agro-ecologically suitable farming strategies, improve the existing technological options and introduce new policies that reduce the over -use of water resources for sustainable agricultural production in dryland regions.

To develop generalities about climate change impacts at dryland sites, we compared broadscale patterns in climate and synthesized primary production responses among the eight terrestrial, nonforested sites of the United States Long-Term Ecological Research (US LTER) Network located in temperate (Southwest and Midwest) and polar (Arctic and Antarctic) regions. All sites experienced warming in recent decades, whereas drought varied regionally with multidecadal phases. Multiple years of wet or dry conditions had larger effects than single years on primary production. Droughts, floods, and wildfires altered resource availability and restructured plant communities, with greater impacts on primary production than warming alone. During severe regional droughts, air pollution from wildfire and dust events peaked. Studies at US LTER drylands over more than 40 years demonstrate reciprocal links and feedbacks among dryland ecosystems, climate-driven disturbance events, and climate change.

Geomorphological archives (lacustrine sediments and beach ridges, alluvial fans, aeolian deposits, peat) recorded palaeoenvironmental change from marine isotope stage (MIS) 7 to the late Holocene. Synthesizing the variety of archives allows a better understanding of geomorphological interactions in arid regions and palaeoenvironmental implications for the area. By performing palaeoshoreline mapping and dating, we identified eight palaeolake levels resulting in a refined lake level history of Orog Nuur. The highest reliably dated shoreline is about 56 m higher than today's lake level and provides evidence for a late MIS 5 lake level between 100 and 75 thousand years (ka). Reconstructions yield a minimum volume estimate of 24.5 km(3), delineating a lake that is 153 times larger than that of today (0.16 km(3)). Massive lake extensions occurred also during MIS 3 and the Holocene. The geomorphological investigation reveals late MIS 5 and MIS 3 lake expansions were of similar magnitude. The palaeoenvironmental reconstruction from early Holocene archives indicates that lake expansion was caused by an increase in precipitation and meltwater inflow from the surrounding mountain systems. Afterwards, lake levels declined with some intermittent highstands during the mid-Holocene (7-5 ka), indicating a general trend towards a lower water inflow throughout the Holocene. Palynological reconstructions of the alpine vegetation development reveal that mid-Holocene highstands (c. 6.5 ka and 5.5 ka) were fed by higher precipitation in the nearby Gurvan Bogd range. Mountain silts, basin silty sands, and Holocene dune deposits provide further evidence for paleoenvironmental change. As controlling factors of the sedimentary system, we identified changes in effective moisture, higher precipitation values and the contribution of meltwater. Orog Nuur Basin archives are valuable for landscape and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions and for comparisons in supraregional reconstruction approaches.

Summer Drylands Program Participan	Multiple scales of spatial heterogeneity control soil respiration responses to precipitation across a dryland rainfall gradient	PLANT AND SOIL												Aims Soil respiration (R-s) is a major pathway for carbon release to the atmosphere. We explored variability in dryland R(s)response to rainfall pulses at multiple levels of spatial heterogeneity: 1) along a hyper-arid to arid rainfall gradient, 2) across soil surfaces that differ in stability and composition, and 3) among different geomorphic and vegetation patch types. Methods We measured in situ R(s)responses for 48 h following simulated rainfall pulses in the Namib Desert. Working across the rainfall gradient, we compared R(s)responses on two soil surfaces. Each soil surface had two vegetation/geomorphic patch types that differed in organic matter sources and transport processes, with one characterized by depositional inputs and one characterized by erosional losses. Results Soil respiration was highly responsive to rainfall pulses, although soil surfaces and patch types often exerted more control on R(s)than did rainfall pulses. Rainfall generally had proportionally greater influence on R(s)with higher annual rainfall. Greater R(s)occurred on stable than unstable soil surfaces and in depositional than erosional patch types. Conclusions Large differences in R(s)among rainfall zones, soil surfaces, and patch types point to the need to carefully consider multiple scales of spatial heterogeneity when interpreting dryland biogeochemical fluxes.

Dryland forests constantly face extreme abiotic conditions, and this affects plant growth and nutrition. We have determined the effects of soil chemical attributes and soil nutrients on the leaf nutrient concentrations of eightProsopis pallidapopulations located along a climatic gradient in the North-Peruvian dryland forests. We analyzed the leaf chemical composition (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn), as well as soil chemical attributes [texture, pH, salinity (electrical conductivity; EC), and the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR)] and soil nutrient concentrations (the same elements as in the leaves) at 2 m from the base of each tree. The soil and leaf nutrient concentrations were not associated with the climatic gradient and were highly variable within populations. Despite the dry conditions, the soil nutrients were not a limiting resource (eutric conditions), and thus the soil chemical attributes were the main driver of the variation in leaf nutrient concentrations. Interestingly, leaf Mn was correlated with soil and leaf nutrients, as well as with soil chemical attributes, suggesting it can be used as an early indicator of plant nutrition.

In this study, two maize-soybean intercropping systems (maize with and without film mulching) were compared with maize and soybean sole crops in rainfed farmland on the Loess Plateau. Different features, including the maize root morphological traits, root vertical distribution, shoot traits, interspecific root overlap, and grain yield of intercrops, were determined after silking in 2017 (dry year) and 2018 (wet year). The intercropped maize (without film mulching) employed a thin root system under dry conditions and a profuse root system under wet conditions, with shallow roots and active root-diameter strategy to adapt to varied water conditions. These features resulted in higher grain yield in per unit area for the intercropped maize (16.97 % overyielding) than sole maize without film mulching. Film mulching of intercropped maize modified the roots with confined growth under dry conditions and inhibited the roots with excessive growth under wet conditions; as a consequence, the two morphologies of intercropped maize root system were reshaped into the optimal one (less profuse but not thin), with S-type vertical distribution (1 m soil profile) for root length and more beneficial root-diameter strategy. Besides, film mulching improved interspecific root interaction through an evident increase in root length or mass in the interspecific overlap regions. Finally, film mulching improved the maize overyielding dramatically (84 %) due to high leaf adaptability and efficient root-shoot synergy in maize plants. Importantly, the maize mulching did not decrease intercropped soybean yield significantly when compared with sole soybean due to the benefits from interspecific facilitation, while it enhanced total grain yield (10.67 %) for the inter cropping system. Thus, film mulching improved maize root morphology and balanced soil resource exploitation and shoot development, consequently strengthening the attainable grain yield in the intercropping system. To conclude, the research elucidates the plant root mechanisms (root morphological changes) underlying over yielding of intercropped maize in varied water conditions. It identifies film mulching of maize as a strategy to optimize root growth and function for higher intercropping yield advantage in dryland.

The objective of the present study was to examine GEI of grain yield among candidate dryland wheat genotypes and to identify promising genotypes for breeding. Seventeen genetically diverse wheat genotypes were evaluated at two sites during the 2015 (high-yielding environment) and 2016 (low-yielding environment) growing seasons in the Limpopo province, South Africa. Grain yield data were subjected to the additive main effect and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) and genotype and genotype-by-environment (GGE) biplot analyses. AMMI analysis of variance revealed highly significant (p <= 0.001) differences among genotypes (G), environments (E) and GEI effects, suggesting differential genotypic response across test environments. Large E (90.5%), and low G (2.96%) and GEI (4.1%) effects were observed on grain yield response. The study identified genotypes G312, G344 and G717 as high yielding and stable, and these were recommended as useful genetic resources for breeding of high-yielding genotypes under South African conditions or similar environments.

The effects of dryland cropping system intensity on soil function and associated changes in macrofauna communities	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Crop production in water-limited environments may be enhanced through improved soil function by facilitating precipitation capture and erosion control. Soil macrofauna are known to support improved soil structure and water dynamics through ecosystem engineering activities, and their populations can be influenced by management. We examined the effect of bare summer fallow frequency on soil macrofauna communities and soil physical properties in a long-term (32-yr) dryland no-till agroecosystem experiment at two sites in eastern Colorado, USA. Treatments represented a gradient of fallow frequency and organic matter inputs, which included wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow, wheat-corn (Zea mays L.)-fallow, and continuously cropped with no planned summer fallow. The design also included a perennial grass treatment with minimal management consisting of six native grasses. We observed links between soil macrofauna and soil functional metrics, particularly related to soil aggregation and water infiltration. There was a trend toward higher macrofauna populations and soil function with increased cropping system intensity, and perennial grass outperformed the cropped treatments significantly for most soil health parameters. Multivariate analyses revealed that different treatments support relatively distinct macrofauna communities. Our results suggest that soil macrofauna populations may be important facilitators of soil structure and associated water dynamics in dryland no-till agroecosystems and respond positively to reduced fallow and higher organic inputs.

It operates worldwide through a network of 15 international research centers. One of these institutions, The International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) has focused on dryland agriculture in the Mediterranean region, specifically in West Asia-North Africa (WANA). Soil fertility, agronomy, and crop nutrition were key areas of its research program. This mini review highlights the research achievements at ICARDA with respect to nitrogen, phosphorus, micronutrients, nutrient dynamics, fertilizer use, soil testing, sustainable cropping and/or crop rotations, and conservation tillage. Despite the destruction of the Center's headquarters in the ongoing civil war and its dispersion in the region, the legacy of ICARDA will survive through documentation of its research in the international literature.																			0002-1962	1435-0645				SEP-OCT	2020	112	5					3350	3360		10.1002/agj2.20374	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.20374													WOS:000600983000012

Whether aridification leads to gradual (or abrupt) and systemic (or specific) changes in the biogeography of abundant and rare microbial species is largely unknown. Here, we investigated stress-adaptive changes (aridity-driven, ranging from 0.65 to 0.94) and biogeographic patterns of abundant and rare bacterial communities in different habitats, including agricultural field, forest, wetland, grassland, and desert, in desert oasis transition zones in northern China. We observed abrupt changes at the breakpoint of aridity values (0.92), characterized by diversity (alpha-diversity and beta-diversity), species coexistence, community assembly processes, and phylogenetic niche conservatism. Specifically, when aridity was <0.92, increasing aridity led to more deterministic assembly and species coexistences for the abundant subcommunity, whereas the reverse was observed for the rare subcommunity. The phylogenetic niche conservatism for both subcommunities increased slowly with aridity. When aridity was >0.92, the systemic responses of abundant and rare taxa changed dramatically in a consistent direction, such that both subcommunities rapidly tended to have a more deterministic assembly, species coexistence, and stronger phylogenetic niche conservatism with increasing aridity. In addition, the change rates of abundant taxa were higher than those of rare taxa, indicating the more sensitive responses of abundant taxa along aridity variation. This finding has important implications for understanding the impact of aridity on the structure and function of abundant and rare soil taxa and how diversity maintenance is associated with soil microbiota responding to global change. The abrupt threshold of soil bacteria found can be used for buffering and for building effective adaptation and mitigation measures aimed at maintaining the capacity of drylands for basic ecosystem functioning. IMPORTANCE Aridity, which is increasing worldwide due to climate change, affects the biodiversity and functions of dryland ecosystems. We provided the first statistical evidence for abrupt changes of species coexistence, ecological processes, and niche conservation of abundant and rare soil bacteria triggered by diversity to abrupt increases in aridity. The abrupt threshold of soil bacterial community response to aridity is spatially heterogeneous at the local scale and should be specified according to local conditions for buffering and for building effective adaptation and mitigation measures aimed at maintaining the capacity of drylands for basic ecosystem functioning.																			2379-5077					JAN-FEB	2022	7	1							e01309-21															WOS:000760939200010

Dryland field validation of genotypic variation in salt tolerance of chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i> L.) determined under controlled conditions	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is a moderately salt-susceptible grain legume species. Genotypic differences in salt tolerance/susceptibility have been identified in chickpea genotypes grown in adequately-watered soil in pots with different salt concentrations, but few studies have been conducted in saline fields. This three-year study compared the growth and yield of chickpea genotypes to determine whether genotypic differences in salt tolerance/susceptibility identified in glasshouse pot experiments applied when grown in a dryland saline field. The emergence, phenology, growth, leaf ion concentration, yield and yield components of 10-20 chickpea genotypes were compared under controlled saline and water conditions in the glasshouse, and saline and non-saline conditions in the field in a semiarid environment. In the field, soil salinity and yields varied from year to year in the non-saline and saline treatments. Genotypic differences in salt tolerance and sensitivity were observed in the controlled salt and water conditions in the glasshouse. The salt tolerant and salt sensitive check genotypes, GENESIS 836 and RUPALI, respectively, grown in all three comparison years were similarly tolerant and sensitive in the glasshouse and dryland field in all three comparison years. However, other genotypes selected for salt tolerance under controlled conditions were not observed to be tolerant in the dryland field. While salinity slowed the rate of emergence and increased the time to flowering, the variation in saline yields among genotypes was associated with aboveground biomass, filled pod number and seed number at maturity in both the glasshouse and field, but not the number of emerged plants that survived to maturity or the delay in flowering. Salinity significantly increased the leaf Na+ , K+ and Cl concentrations in the glasshouse and field (except in the glasshouse in 2010). Na+ increased in young and old leaves by 28-84%, but the concentrations of Na+ or K+ in the leaves across genotypes was not correlated with yield in saline soil. Salinity increased leaf Cl concentrations by 80-290%; the increase in young leaves had a significant association with reduced yield among genotypes only in the glasshouse in one year. We conclude that selection under controlled soil salinity and water content in pots can identify some genotypes that are salt tolerant, but for dryland saline environments verification of their tolerance in comparable environments is essential.

NDVI Response to Satellite-Estimated Antecedent Precipitation in Dryland Pastures	REMOTE SENSING												Precipitation is a critical driver of vegetation productivity and dynamics in dryland environments, especially in areas with intense livestock farming. Availability and access to accurate, reliable, and timely rainfall data are essential for natural resources management, environmental monitoring, and informing hydrological rainfall-runoff models. Gauged precipitation data in drylands are often scarce, fragmented, and with low spatial resolution; therefore, satellite-estimated precipitation becomes a valuable dataset for overcoming this constraint. Using statistical indices, we compared satellite-derived precipitation data from four products (CHIRPS, GPM, TRMM, and PERSIANN-CDR) against gauged data at different temporal scales (daily, monthly, and yearly). Spatial correlations were calculated for GPM and CHIRPS estimates against interpolated gauged precipitation. We then estimated NDVI response to Antecedent Accumulated Precipitation (AAP) for 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of four major vegetation types typical of the region. Statistical metrics varied with temporal scales being highest and acceptable for periods of 1 month or 1 year. At monthly scale GPM presented the best Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (r), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR) and CHIRPS resulted in lower Mean Error (ME) and Bias. On an annual basis CHIRPS showed the best adjustment for all indicators except for r. NDVI responses to 3 months of AAP were significant for all vegetation types in the study area. The findings of this study show that estimated precipitation data from GPM and CHIRPS satellites are accurate and valuable as a tool for analysing the relationships between precipitation and vegetation in the drylands of Mendoza.

DEPOSITION AND DECOMPOSITION OF UNGULATE DUNG AND ASSOCIATED NITROGEN INPUTS ON A DRYLAND RIVER FLOODPLAIN	SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST												Nutrient dynamics in dryland river floodplains remain poorly understood, particularly where ungulate herbivory results in significant dung deposition. I assessed organic matter and nitrogen (N) losses from elk (Cervus elaphus) dung deposited on the floodplain of the unregulated Yampa River in semiarid northwestern Colorado. Intact elk fecal pellets were placed on relatively high, vegetated floodplain surfaces in loose piles or enclosed in mesh bags and monitored for up to 847 days. No pellets were inundated by Yampa floodwaters. Modified exponential decay models indicated intact pellets lost 50% of their initial ash-free dry matter (AFDM) and N content in 980 and 903 days, respectively, and 90% in 2,224 and 1,820 days, respectively. Macroinvertebrates appeared to be unimportant in decomposition. Based on dung deposited in <= 19 permanent 28-m(2) plots monitored from 1999 to 2006, elk added an average 13.7 g AFDM.m(-2) and 200 mg N.m(-2) to the floodplain each year. Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) added an average of 2.85 g AFDM.m(-2) and 68.2 mg N.m(-2) each year. Fecal N deposited on the floodplain, but derived from foraging outside it, would add to the N in flood-deposited sediment hypothesized to explain the N buildup observed during succession on the Yampa floodplain. The roles of large herbivores and dung decay processes in N cycling and dynamics on this and other dryland floodplains warrant greater attention.																			0038-4909	1943-6262				SEP	2021	66	3					213	224		10.1894/0038-4909-66.3.213	http://dx.doi.org/10.1894/0038-4909-66.3.213													WOS:000886924700004

Therefore, it is imperative that global terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs), which form the land component of IPCC earth system models, are able to accurately simulate dryland vegetation and biogeochemical processes. However, compared to more mesic ecosystems, TBMs have not been widely tested or optimized using in situ dryland CO2 fluxes. Here, we address this gap using a Bayesian data assimilation system and 89 site-years of daily net ecosystem exchange (NEE) data from 12 southwest US Ameriflux sites to optimize the C cycle parameters of the ORCHIDEE TBM. The sites span high elevation forest ecosystems, which are a mean sink of C, and low elevation shrub and grass ecosystems that are either a mean C sink or "pivot" between an annual C sink and source. We find that using the default (prior) model parameters drastically underestimates both the mean annual NEE at the forested mean C sink sites and the NEE IAV across all sites. Our analysis demonstrated that optimizing phenology parameters are particularly useful in improving the model's ability to capture both the magnitude and sign of the NEE IAV. At the forest sites, optimizing C allocation, respiration, and biomass and soil C turnover parameters reduces the underestimate in simulated mean annual NEE. Our study demonstrates that all TBMs need to be calibrated for dryland ecosystems before they are used to determine dryland contributions to global C cycle variability and long-term carbon-climate feedbacks.

Assessing the environmental impacts of urban expansion is highly important for the sustainable development of these dryland regions and beyond. Thus, this study aimed to assess the effects of urban expansion on environmental sustainability in the agro-pastoral transitional zone of northern China (APTZNC), a major dryland region of China. We first analyzed the patterns and modes of urban expansion and estimated the dynamics of environmental sustainability by integrating indicators of the environmental elements of water, land, air, and biodiversity from 2000 to 2015. Then, we assessed the impacts of the overall process and the different modes of urban expansion on environmental sustainability based on structural equation models. We found that the APTZNC experienced rapid urban expansion dominated by the edge expansion and leapfrog modes. The urban land area increased from 2169 km(2) to 6128 km(2) at an annual growth rate of 7.17%. This rapid urban expansion had significantly negative influences on environmental sustainability with a path coefficient of -0.98 (P < 0.001), leading to a decline of the comprehensive index of environmental sustainability from 64.22 to 50.77, a decrease of 20.93%. We also found that the three urban expansion modes had different effects on environmental sustainability, where the leapfrog mode had the greatest effect, followed by the edge expansion mode, Thus, effective management is needed to increase urban land efficiency and optimize urban land patterns to promote the sustainability of urban expansion in the APTZNC.

Higher leaf nitrogen content is linked to tighter stomatal regulation of transpiration and more efficient water use across dryland trees	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												The least-cost economic theory of photosynthesis shows that water and nitrogen are mutually substitutable resources to achieve a given carbon gain. However, vegetation in the Sahel has to cope with the dual challenge imposed by drought and nutrient-poor soils. We addressed how variation in leaf nitrogen per area (N-area) modulates leaf oxygen and carbon isotopic composition (delta O-18, delta C-13) proxies of stomatal conductance and water-use efficiency, across 34 Sahelian woody species. Dryland species exhibited diverging leaf delta O-18 and delta C-13 values, indicating large interspecific variation in time-integrated stomatal conductance and water-use efficiency. Structural equation modeling revealed that leaf N-area is a pivotal trait linked to multiple water-use traits. Leaf N area was positively linked to both delta O-18 and delta C-13, suggesting higher carboxylation capacity and tighter stomatal regulation of transpiration in N-rich species, which allows them to achieve higher water-use efficiency and more conservative water use. These adaptations represent a key physiological advantage of N-rich species, such as legumes, that could contribute to their dominance across many dryland regions. This is the first report of a robust mechanistic link between leaf N-area and delta O-18 in dryland vegetation that is consistent with core principles of plant physiology.

We tested the effect of resource redistribution (water and nutrients) relative role of biomass, grass and forb abundance as mediators of species diversity. Our research was conducted in five small watersheds located in the central Negev Highlands, Israel. We quantified nutrient addition including soil nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, total water content, and soil organic matter, in the liman, compared with two microsites (upstream, and downstream) along watersheds. We quantified biomass, grass and forb abundance and species richness in two successive years. We used structural equation modeling to study the effect of grass and forb abundance and biomass on the species richness of herbaceous plant communities. All tested soil properties significantly improved in the lint= compared with the two microsites. Annual biomass increased significantly in the liman in compared with the downstream microsite. Our results also indicate a reduction in forb abundance in the liman and the downstream, and increment in the grass abundance in the liman microsite, leading to a decline in plant species richness. We conclude that diversity responses to biomass production are both resource-specific and functional group-specific.

Climatic Sensitivity of Dryland Soil CO<sub>2</sub> Fluxes Differs Dramatically with Biological Soil Crust Successional State	ECOSYSTEMS												Arid and semiarid ecosystems make up approximately 41% of Earth's terrestrial surface and are suggested to regulate the trend and interannual variability of the global terrestrial carbon (C) sink. Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are common dryland soil surface communities of bryophytes, lichens, and/or cyanobacteria that bind the soil surface together and that may play an important role in regulating the climatic sensitivity of the dryland C cycle. Major uncertainties exist in our understanding of the interacting effects of changing temperature and moisture on CO2 uptake (photosynthesis) and loss (respiration) from biocrust and sub-crust soil, particularly as related to biocrust successional state. Here, we used a mesocosm approach to assess how biocrust successional states related to climate treatments. We subjected bare soil (Bare), early successional lightly pigmented cyanobacterial biocrust (Early), and late successional darkly pigmented moss-lichen biocrust (Late) to either ambient or +5 degrees C above ambient soil temperature for 84days. Under ambient temperatures, Late biocrust mesocosms showed frequent net uptake of CO2, whereas Bare soil, Early biocrust, and warmed Late biocrust mesocosms mostly lost CO2 to the atmosphere. The inhibiting effect of warming on CO2 exchange was a result of accelerated drying of biocrust and soil. We used these data to parameterize, via Bayesian methods, a model of ecosystem CO2 fluxes, and evaluated the model with data from an autochamber CO2 system at our field site on the Colorado Plateau in SE Utah. In the context of the field experiment, the data underscore the negative effect of warming on fluxes both biocrust CO2 uptake and losswhich, because biocrusts are a dominant land cover type in this ecosystem, may extend to ecosystem-scale C cycling.

Natural infrastructure in dryland streams (NIDS) can establish regenerative wetland sinks that reverse desertification and strengthen climate resilience	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In this article we describe the natural hydrogeomorphological and biogeochemical cycles of dryland fluvial ecosystems that make them unique, yet vulnerable to land use activities and climate change. We introduce Natural Infrastructure in Dryland Streams (NIDS), which are structures naturally or anthropogenically created from earth, wood, debris, or rock that can restore implicit function of these systems. This manuscript further discusses the capability of and func-tional similarities between beaver dams and anthropogenic NIDS, documented by decades of scientific study. In addi-tion, we present the novel, evidence-based finding that NIDS can create wetlands in water-scarce riparian zones, with soil organic carbon stock as much as 200 to 1400 Mg C/ha in the top meter of soil. We identify the key restorative ac-tion of NIDS, which is to slow the drainage of water from the landscape such that more of it can infiltrate and be used to facilitate natural physical, chemical, and biological processes in fluvial environments. Specifically, we assert that the rapid drainage of water from such environments can be reversed through the restoration of natural infrastructure that once existed. We then explore how NIDS can be used to restore the natural biogeochemical feedback loops in these systems. We provide examples of how NIDS have been used to restore such feedback loops, the lessons learned from installation of NIDS in the dryland streams of the southwestern United States, how such efforts might be scaled up, and what the implications are for mitigating climate change effects. Our synthesis portrays how restoration using NIDS can support adaptation to and protection from climate-related disturbances and stressors such as drought, water shortages, flooding, heatwaves, dust storms, wildfire, biodiversity losses, and food insecurity.

We hypothesized that combining high inputs from cover crops with no-tillage will increase long-termSOC stocks. Caatinga shrublands had been cleared in 1972 for arable crops and palmplantations before implementing field experiments on Mango and Melon systems (established in 2009 and 2012, respectively). Each of the two experiments were managed with no-till (NT) or conventional till (CT), and three types of cover cropping, either a plant mixture of 75% (PM1) or 25% (PM2) legumes, or spontaneous vegetation (SV). The RothC model was used with a daily timestep to simulate the soil moisture dynamics and C turnover for this dry climate. Carbon inputs were between 2.62 and 5.82 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) and increased the depleted SOC stocks by 0.08 to 0.56 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). Scenarios of continuous biomass inputs of ca. 5 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) for 60 years are likely to increase SOC stocks in the mango NT beyond the original Caatinga SOC by between 19.2 and 20.5 Mg C ha(-1). Under CT similar inputs would increase SOC stocks only marginally above depletion (2.75 to 2.47 Mg C ha(-1)). Under melon, annual carbon inputs are slightly greater (up to 5.5 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) and SOC stocks would increase on average by another 8% to 22.3 to 20.6 Mg C ha(-1) under NT and by 8 Mg C ha(-1) under CT. These long-term simulations show that combining NT with high quality cover crops (PM1, PM2) would exceed SOC stocks of the initial Caatinga within 20 and 25 years under irrigated melon and mango cultivation, respectively. These results present a solution to reverse prior loss of SOC by replacing CT dryland agriculture with irrigated NT plus high input cover crops agroecosystems. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Planting patterns have great influence on improving soil water storage and yield, and should be matched with different seeding rates. In order to assess the effect of different sowing methods on the drought resistance and stable yield of dryland wheat, a field experiment was conducted in Wenxi County Dryland Wheat Experimental Base in Shanxi Province, China. In the current study, the effects of three planting techniques (drilling sowing, furrow sowing, and film-mulched sowing) and four seeding rates (150, 225, 300, and 375 kg ha(-1)) were examined on water storage, dry matter formation, yield, and water use efficiency (WUE). The results showed that furrow sowing (FS) and film-mulched sowing (FM) treatments increased soil water storage in the 0-300 cm soil layer at overwintering and jointing stages. In addition, FS and FM increased soil water consumption in the 0-300 cm soil layer from overwintering to maturity of wheat. Furthermore, FS and FM significantly increased the dry matter accumulation from the overwintering to the mature stage, promoted its accumulation in vegetative organs and translocation to grains after anthesis, viz., increased yield by 6.2% and 7.9%, and WUE by 4.6% and 5.3%, respectively, as compared with those of the drilling sowing (DS) treatments. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that grain yield had a significantly positive correlation with soil water storage at overwintering and jointing. Moreover, grain yield was significantly positively correlated with soil water consumption in the 0-300 cm soil layer from jointing to maturity. Additionally, the seeding rate of 150 kg ha(-1) with FS could obtain higher WUE and grain yield. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that the seeding rate of 150 kg ha(-1) is used with FS to improve the grain yield and WUE of dryland agricultural systems in China.																				2073-4395				MAR	2023	13	3							851	10.3390/agronomy13030851	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13030851													WOS:000954004100001

This study assessed the variation in edaphic factors between wetlands and along their littoral gradients to detect the boundary between the endorheic wetlands and upland zones. A sample of 202 paired measurements of three edaphic factors were collected (Soil Moisture Content - SMC-g/g, Bulk Density - BD-g/cm (3) and Salinity as Electrical Conductivity - EC-dS/m) in 10 m plots along 14 belt transects in eight representative wetlands in the Mpumalanga Lake District, South Africa. In general, there were significant differences between the eight wetlands for SMC and BD but not for EC.SMC and BD generally showed negative trends along the littoral gradients. The trends occurred over short distances, ranging from 30 to 70 m, reflecting the extent of the wetlands. Understanding of the spatial variation of edaphic factors helps in the management and monitoring of depressional wetlands under a changing climate. In addition, the study showed that the current wetland buffer zone stipulated in local legislation was too narrow and recommended that this be extended to 100 m.

However, the applicability and prediction performance of machine learning techniques in dryland agroecosystems still needs to be further studied. In this study, we collected a total of 733 topsoil samples from the farmland in Xiao County, Anhui Province, which is a typical dryland agroecosystem in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain. Then, the environmental covariates were selected, and the ordinary kriging (OK), multiple linear stepwise regression (MLR), regression kriging (RK), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), and random forest (RF) models were conducted to map the SOM content, and the optimal model was ascertained. The results demonstrated that the alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen (26.11%), available potassium (17.73%), mean annual precipitation (13.26%), and pH (11.80%) were the main controlling factors affecting the spatial distribution of SOM in the study area. Meanwhile, the introduction of environmental covariates can effectively improve the SOM prediction accuracy, and the RF model (R-2 = 0.48, MAE = 2.38 g kg(-1), MRE = 12.99%, RMSE = 3.14 g kg(-1)) has a better performance than the RFBNN, MLR, RK, and OK methods. Although there are local differences in the spatial distribution of SOM predicted by the five methods, the overall spatial distribution of SOM was characterized by the low concentration area (13.44-20.00 g kg(-1)) distributed in the central and northwest of study area, and the high concentration area (24.00-28.95 g kg(-1)) distributed in the southeast. Overall, our study demonstrated that machine learning-based models could accurately predict the SOM content in dryland agroecosystem, and the produced maps function as baseline maps for sustainable agricultural management.					xie, xuefeng/AEQ-7470-2022	xie, xuefeng/0000-0002-2323-7452														2072-4292				OCT	2023	15	20							4945	10.3390/rs15204945	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15204945													WOS:001099402100001

The present study is to investigate the seasonal variations of cyanobacteria-dominated crust characteristics in a dryland ecosystem, including crusts thickness, chlorophyll a, proteins, polysaccharides, and carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) contents and to clarify the effects of crust characteristics together with soil properties on soil enzymes beneath crusts.MethodsCyanobacteria-dominated crusts and soils beneath crusts were sampled in spring (March 14), summer (June 15), autumn (September 14), and winter (December 15) of 2020 in the southeast edge of Tengger Desert in northern China.ResultsChlorophyll a, proteins, polysaccharides, and crusts C and N showed higher values in spring and autumn, while thickness, crusts P, C: N, C: P, and N: P have no significant changes throughout all seasons. Soil enzyme activities beneath crusts declined with increasing depth, whereas enzyme behavior differed among seasons. Redundancy analysis indicated that crust proteins and soil water content were the important factors accounting for differences in soil enzymes in 0-5 cm soil layer, while the determining factors for soil enzymes in 5-10 cm soil layer were proteins, soil organic carbon, soil available phosphorus, and thickness.ConclusionThe seasonal variations in cyanobacteria-dominated crusts mainly come from changing proteins, polysaccharides, C, and N contents. The stable C: N, C: P, and N: P ratios did not change significantly over the seasons, thus keeping a stable state of crusts in the current dryland ecosystem. Moreover, proteins, soil organic carbon, and soil moisture make great contributions to the seasonal variations of soil enzymes. Overall, our findings demonstrate the depth-related response of soil enzymes to cyanobacteria-dominated crusts in seasons and highlight the ecological function of cyanobacteria-dominated crust characteristics in seasonal fluctuations.																			1439-0108	1614-7480				JUL	2023	23	7					2756	2765		10.1007/s11368-023-03514-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-023-03514-x		MAY 2023											WOS:000982950300001

Elevated atmospheric CO2 (e[CO2]) and nitrogen (N) fertilisation stimulate biomass and yield of crops. However, their interactions depend on crop growth stages and may affect water use dynamics. Aims and methods. This study investigated the interactive effects of two N rates, 0 and 100 kg N ha(-1), and two CO2 concentrations, ambient (a[CO2], similar to 400 mu mol mol(-1)) and e[CO2] (similar to 550 mu mol mol(-)1), on biomass, yield and water use of two wheat cultivars, Wyalkatchem (N-use efficient) and Yitpi (local), using a free air CO2 enrichment facility. Key results. Elevated [CO2] stimulated leaf area (10%, P = 0.003) and aboveground biomass (11%, P = 0.03). In addition, e[CO2] reduced stomatal conductance (25%, P < 0.001) and increased net assimilation rates (12%, P < 0.001), resulting in greater (40%, P < 0.001) intrinsic water use efficiency. During early growth stages, e[CO2] resulted in higher water use than a[CO2]; however, this difference disappeared later in the season, resulting in similar cumulative water use under both CO2 concentrations. Supplemental N stimulated grain yield of Yitpi by 14% while decreasing that of Wyalkatchem by 7% (N x cultivar, P = 0.063). With supplemental N, Yitpi maintained greater post-anthesis leaf N, chlorophyll content, canopy cover and net assimilation rate than Wyalkatchem. Conclusions. During early growth stages, the e[CO2]-induced stimulation of leaf-level water use efficiency was offset by greater biomass, resulting in higher water use. By the end of the season, similar cumulative water use under both CO2 concentrations indicates the dominating effect of the prevailing seasonal conditions in the study area. Observed yield responses of the studied cultivars to supplemental N were associated with their ability to maintain post-anthesis photosynthetic capabilities. Implications. Our findings suggest that N-use efficiency traits and responsiveness need to be considered independently to optimise benefits from the 'CO2 fertilisation effect' through breeding.

Diel cycles of <i>δ</i><SUP>13</SUP>C<sub>DIC</sub> and ecosystem metabolism in ephemeral dryland streams	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Streams in hot, arid environments often exist as a series of isolated pools along main channels. During these periods, shallow alluvial through flow may strongly influence key ecological processes within pools. We measured diel changes in delta C-13 values of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved oxygen (DO) in two pools of ephemeral, dryland streams. We quantified alluvial water connectivity through stable isotope analysis (delta O-18 and delta H-2) of pool and alluvial water. We also estimated gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) rates across a wider set of pools in both streams. delta C-13(DIC) values displayed regular diel cycles, where both pools displayed small but similar daily amplitude (0.7-0.9 parts per thousand) despite contrasting amplitudes of change in DO (0.8 mg L-1 vs. 2.8 mg L-1) and contrasting alluvial water connectivity (connected vs. disconnected). Water temperature was the strongest predictor of both delta C-13(DIC) values and rates of change in delta C-13(DIC) across both pools. Across both streams, all pools were net heterotrophic. GPP (0.35-1.73 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)) and ER (0.49-2.64 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)) rates were linked to aquatic vegetation cover. The disconnect between diurnal amplitudes of delta C-13 values and DO concentrations thus suggests that ecological drivers of gas exchange became increasingly localised as pools contracted.

The valuable local environmental and scientific knowledge (LESK) of dryland SESs is crucial for adaptive governance but remains scarce. Here, we proposed an analytical framework to understand the LESK in relation to the mechanisms of ecological policy-household interactions and ecological performance of resource systems. According to this framework, we explored LESK by linking land surface dynamics and investigations of policy and households in a typical dryland region, Minqin. We reported that ecological policy contributed to significant socio-ecological benefits, including increased water resources, land desertification reduction, and natural vegetation restoration. However, there exist conflicting aspects, demonstrated by the encroachment of agricultural land, which increases the land degradation risk of oasis. These results implied that top-down ecological policy and bottom-up household responses caused both positive and negative LDN outcomes, which can be attributed to collective and conflicted actions between the self-interest orientation of multiple stakeholders. By investigating households, we found that education-induced economic need was one of the major drivers for the conflicted actions on the policy of agricultural land reduction. Therefore, we proposed a series of adaptive measurements to balance short-term economic concerns and long-term LDN. This study also highlighted that navigated LESK should be considered for future sustainable management and ecosystem modeling.																			0264-8377	1873-5754				JAN	2022	112								105863	10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105863	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105863													WOS:000731335300001

Physiological Basis of Genotypic Response to Management in Dryland Wheat	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												A great majority of dryland wheat producers are reluctant to intensify management due to the assumption that lack of water availability is the most critical factor limiting yield and thus, the response to management intensification would be limited. We conducted on-farm field experiments across three locations and two growing seasons in Kansas using 21 modern winter wheat genotypes grown under either standard (SM) or intensified management (IM) systems. The goals of this study were to (i) determine whether the SM adopted is adequate to reach achievable yields by farmers in the region and (ii) identify differences in responsiveness to IM among a range of modern genotypes. Across all sites-years and genotypes, the IM increased yield by 0.9 Mg ha(-1), outyielding the SM system even in the lowest yielding conditions. As expected, the yield response to IM increased with the achievable yield of the environment and genotype. Across all sources of variation, the yield responsiveness to IM was related to increased biomass rather than harvest index, strongly driven by improvements in grain number (and independent of changes in grain weight), and by improvements in N uptake which resulted from greater biomass and shoot N concentration. The IM system generally also increased grain N concentration and decreased the grain N dilution effect from increased yield. Genotypes varied in their response to IM, with major response patterns resulting from the combination of response magnitude (large vs. small) and consistency (variable vs. consistent). Genotypes with high mean response and high variability in the response to IM across years could offer greater opportunities for producers to maximize yield as those genotypes showed greater yield gain from IM when conditions favored their response. For the background conditions evaluated, intensifying management could improve wheat yield in between c. 0.2 and 1.5 Mg ha(-1) depending on genotype.

Plastic film mulch (PM) is widely used to improve water use efficiency (WUE) and increase crop yield over conventional methods (no mulch, NM) in China. To get a better understanding about PM influence on water use process in the field, we defined WUETWI as the ratio of yield (Y) to the total water input (TWI), and divided WUE Thri into 4 steps by means of a systematic and quantitative approach. The 4 steps included ratio of available soil water (SW) to TWI (SW0 (+) (P), where SW0 is available soil water at the sowing, P is seasonal precipitation), ratio of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) to SW, ratio of crop transpiration (T) to ETc and transpiration efficiency (WUET, Y/T). Three field experiments were conducted to analyze the influence of PM on soil moisture content, water consumption, and the grain yield of dryland spring maize (Zea mays L.). Results showed that, compared with NM, spring maize yield of PM was increased by 28.6%, and the WUETWI of PM was increased by 26.4% on average in the experiment 1. Since ETc with PM was slightly higher than that with NM, the ETc/SW was increased by 3.9%. In the experiment 2, the T/ETc with PM was 77.7% on average, 30.6% higher than that with NM; the Y/T increased by 13.6% from NM to PM. Precipitation storage efficiency increased linearly with the percentage of PM. Improved crop growth under PM led to higher crop biomass and higher leaf area index, which might result in higher transpiration rate. The T/ETc under PM was also increased.					; liu, wenzhao/W-6265-2018	Liu, Wenzhao/0000-0002-7798-8235; liu, wenzhao/0000-0001-7506-0663													0378-3774	1873-2283				SEP 1	2019	224								105710	10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105710	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105710													WOS:000495461500004

Two-year crop sequences were established in four fields in central Montana to determine if grain yield could be maintained when wheat followed warm-season annual crops compared with fallow in shallow (soil depth <= 650 mm) dryland soils. More than 15 warm-season species along with three crop mixtures were managed as cover, forage, and grain or seed crops in the 1st year. Differences were not detected in volumetric soil water content (VWC) following fallow and warm-season crops (P > .8). Wheat yield following fallow averaged 2.1 Mg ha(-1) and was comparable following warm-season broadleaf crops and grass-broadleaf crop mixtures (2.0 Mg ha(-1), P > .50), while trending downward slightly following grasses (1.9 Mg ha(-1), P = .08). Previous crop management (cover, forage, and grain or seed crop) did not affect subsequent wheat yield (P = .98), but did affect wheat grain protein (P < .01). Wheat grain protein concentration was higher following fallow (124 g kg(-1)) than warm-season grass and broadleaf crops, as well as mixtures (116 g kg(-1)), but was below the 132 g kg(-1) threshold indicating N deficiency, regardless of previous-year treatment. These results indicate that grain yield of wheat can be maintained following warm-season annual crops compared with fallow in central Montana and similar semi-arid environments with shallow soils, though soil N supplementation is needed to optimize grain yield and quality.

Size Distribution of Mineral Dust Emissions From Sparsely Vegetated and Supply-Limited Dryland Soils	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Controls on the particle size distribution (PSD) of mineral dust emissions remain poorly understood. Under near-idealized conditions, dust PSDs can appear invariant with wind friction velocity. However, dryland vegetation attenuates surface friction velocities, and soil crusting reduces the supply of loose erodible material and increases surface resistance to abrasion. Under such conditions, variability in saltation bombardment efficiency and intensity could have a large effect on dust PSDs. We present dust emission measurements from vegetated, supply-limited aeolian systems that indicate the dependence of emission-flux PSD on wind friction velocity. We find the fine fraction (<5 mu m) of dust particles increases with friction velocity. Results suggest models that assume wind-invariance of the emission-flux PSD may not be generalizable for crusted soils with vegetation. There is a need for dust models to represent variability in emission-flux PSDs for land management, air quality, and climate applications across vegetated and sediment supply-limited drylands.

They can be affected by soil microhabitat formed by plant species, soil depth, soil properties, and seasonality in drylands. We evaluated the effect of soil microhabitat, soil depth, and seasonality on the free-living diazotrophs in a Mexican tropical dryland, through the analysis of the number of nifH genes in soil beneath the shrubs Parkinsonia praecox and Prosopis laevigata, and in bare soil at different soil depths, during the dry and rainy seasons. We also evaluated the relationship between the nifH genes and soil properties. The number of nifH genes was greater under P. laevigata than under P. praecox and in bare soil during the rainy season. The nifH genes were related to soil moisture content and orthophosphates during the dry season. The number of nifH genes was greater in the upper than in the lower soil layers in P. laevigata and bare soil, but not in P. praecox. The number of nifH genes was greater in the rainy than in the dry season. We concluded that soil microhabitat, soil depth, and seasonality can control the free-living diazotrophs in this Mexican tropical dryland.

There is increasing concern over the potential for increasing nitrogen (N) inputs to affect biocrusts. This is of special concern in Mediterranean Basin drylands that face the threat of increased N inputs however, the effect on biocrusts remains poorly studied. We evaluated the potential effects of increased N inputs on biocrust structure and functioning in surrounding Mediterranean shrublands in the seventh year of a N-manipulation field experiment. We tracked the N-driven changes in biotope (changes in bare soil and in the non-legume and the legume occupation areas, and the percentage of radiation intercepted by plant canopies), evaluated biocrust functional traits (based on pigments) and measured biocrust functioning in terms of C and N cycling, soil fertility (macro and micronutrients) and biodiversity, and integrated these multiple soil functions simultaneously (i.e. soil multifunctionality) Biocrust pigment concentration was significantly influenced by both plant legacy and N input. Biocrust pigments revealed a clear functional shift from: i) biocrusts dominated by photosynthetically inactive cyanobacteria that fix N-2 and are mostly committed to photopmtection at the expense of N-containing pigments under low N inputs; into ii) biocrusts more evenly composed of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, which are more photosynthetically active, but less committed to photoprotection and N-2 fixation under exposure to increased N inputs. The N-driven functional and structural changes in biocrusts resulted in trade-offs in biocrust functioning and processes (only N-2 fixation was affected) and an overall improvement in biocrust multifunctionality. By itself, biocrust pigment evenness accounted for similar to 50% of the observed variation in biocrust multifunctionality. The biocrust pigment functional approach we adopted to study the effects of increased N inputs from patchy developed anthropogenic landscapes provides novel and critical knowledge of biocrusts community and functioning, which may be used as a tool in biodiversity conservation strategies, ecosystem functions and ecological modelling.

Over time, repeated fallow periods deplete soil organic matter, a foundation of soil health that affects the long-term functional capacity of soils. Reducing fallow periods by growing cover crops (non-harvested crops terminated prior to reproductive development), double cropping (increasing the frequency of harvested crops), or rotating to ley pasture for several years, were investigated for their potential to improve or maintain soil functional attributes. These 'reduced fallow' systems were compared against a conventional cereal-based production system with seasonal fallows as well as against a permanent fallow. Soil in the reduced fallow systems had higher concentrations of total nitrogen and mineralassociated nitrogen compared with the conventional system and permanent fallow. Reduced fallow systems also had higher concentrations of total organic carbon and mineral-associated carbon than the permanent fallow, but not the conventional system. These changes were associated with greater soil microbial respiration and improved surface soil moisture storage at cash crop planting. The conventional, cover crop and ley pasture systems had similar soil structure with greater abundance of mega-aggregates. In contrast, the double crop system had greater abundance of micro- and macro-aggregates as did the ley pasture systems that were subject to tillage after three years in preparation for a return to cropping. The ley pasture also had substantially greater numbers of root-lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus thornei), surpassing the 2000 nematodes kg-1 threshold for economic damage. The results demonstrate that different methods for reducing fallow periods can generate a range of outcomes that are not uniformly desirable in terms of soil functional attributes. Across the indicators assessed, the cover crop system generated the widest range of improvements in soil fertility and function compared with the conventional system. This suggests cover cropping may be a valuable tool for promoting soil health in subtropical dryland farming systems.

Effect of interannual precipitation variability on dryland productivity: A global synthesis	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Climate-change assessments project increasing precipitation variability through increased frequency of extreme events. However, the effects of interannual precipitation variance per se on ecosystem functioning have been largely understudied. Here, we report on the effects of interannual precipitation variability on the primary production of global drylands, which include deserts, steppes, shrublands, grasslands, and prairies and cover about 40% of the terrestrial earth surface. We used a global database that has 43 datasets, which are uniformly distributed in parameter space and each has at least 10 years of data. We found (a) that at the global scale, precipitation variability has a negative effect on aboveground net primary production. (b) Expected increases in interannual precipitation variability for the year 2,100 may result in a decrease of up to 12% of the global terrestrial carbon sink. (c) The effect of precipitation interannual variability on dryland productivity changes from positive to negative along a precipitation gradient. Arid sites with mean precipitation under 300 mm/year responded positively to increases in precipitation variability, whereas sites with mean precipitation over 300 mm/year responded negatively. We propose three complementary mechanisms to explain this result: (a) concave-up and concave-down precipitation-production relationships in arid vs. humid systems, (b) shift in the distribution of water in the soil profile, and (c) altered frequency of positive and negative legacies. Our results demonstrated that enhanced precipitation variability will have direct impacts on global drylands that can potentially affect the future terrestrial carbon sink.

This paper developed a methodological framework in the generic spectral endmember space (SVD, soils and substrates, vegetation, and dark surface endmembers ) of Landsat-8 OLI (operational land imager) imagery to concretize the catastrophe model of dryland cover state based on the co-development of plant and soil variables in a landscape. A cover function index (LCI) was proposed together with cover type growth form as cover variables in multi-seasonal SVD space. Furthermore, ecological site (ES) and topographic wetness index (TWI) were used as the landscape variables. The four variables as the explanatory variates, soil organic matter (SOM) as a slow response variable of dryland cover state, were explored by classification and regression trees (CART) for the state space. Using the Minqin dryland system in China as a case study, CART explored 65.9% amounts of SOM variance of 85 training samples with the four explanatory variables, and the measured SOM had liner relationship with CART predicted SOM at 0.05 significant level with the explained 39% SOM variance for 10 test samples. In the learned transparent tree, the two alternative stable states were identified correctly and validated by another soil intrinsic clay content variable independently, one was the current highest average SOM (26.757 g kg(-1)) of perennial forest/shrub covers, the other was the bared or sparse vegetation cover with low average SOM (<= 8.518 g kg(-1)) as a critical SOM limit in a given ecological site type. The mean clay content of the undesirable alternative states was all below 60 g kg(-1) with severe soil physical degradation, and had a clear breaking gap with other states. Moreover, the SOM-LCI plane projected the unstable states being folded in the basins of the attraction of two alternative stable states (i.e. 0.39-0.76 LCI) with relative resilience analysis of pathways. In the 10 test sites, only 1 site of the state was not predicted correctly. The results suggest the model has a level of predictability for dryland cover state and its pathway. According to the estimated states, there has 12.74% study area improved and continued to recovering the desirable states, and the study area has already net improvement at the landscape level. Therefore, without the comparable series of historical data for adaptive management, the developed framework in SVD of Landsat imagery is a cost-effective and time-saving tool, which helps managers to assess and develop appropriate management with a more spatially diversified strategy for zero net land degradation using a space-for-time substitution in an era of unprecedented change.						, Qiangqiang Sun/0000-0003-2017-6743													0143-1161	1366-5901				JUL 18	2019	40	14					5673	5694		10.1080/01431161.2019.1580795	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2019.1580795													WOS:000465406100019

The proteins were extracted from wet distillers' grains with solubles (WDGS) and characterized in terms of purity and in vitro digestibility. Starch, crude protein, crude fat, and fiber contents of the sorghums ranged from 64.16 to 68.05 g/100 g, 11.49-13.54 g/100 g, 2.45-2.98 g/100 g, and 1.62-1.80 g/100 g, respectively. For the same variety, the sorghums grown under dryland conditions had higher protein (0.33-0.91 g/100 g) and lower starch contents (0.74-1.72 g/100 g) than those grown under irrigation conditions. The highest ethanol concentration (85.15 g/L) and yield (41.64 mL/100 g sorghum) were obtained from the NS under dryland conditions and HPS under irrigation conditions, respectively. Sorghums from irrigated land displayed 0.56-8.23 mL/100 g sorghum of ethanol yield higher than those from dryland. Protein (40.21-45.13 g/ 100 g), crude fat (11.54-13.95 g/100 g), and crude fiber (7.13-9.29 g/100 g) contents in dried distillers' grains with solubles (DDGS) were increased approximately four times compared to the raw sorghum flour. The purity and digestibility in terms of the degree of hydrolysis of the proteins isolated from different sorghum sources ranged from 88.82 to 94.22% and 33.35 to 37.29%, respectively. In addition, the effects of sorghum variety, treatment (dryland and irrigated land), and their interaction on the chemical composition of sorghum and DDGS, ethanol concentration and yield, as well as the purity and digestibility of WDGS proteins were elucidated with a set of correlation coefficients among parameters associated with sorghum.					li, yurong/JMQ-8540-2023; Bean, Scott/AAE-9327-2019; Weiss, Tommy/HJI-8962-2023; du, zhenjiao/ITV-7171-2023; LI, Yonghui/E-8925-2011	Bean, Scott/0000-0001-8678-8094; Weiss, Tommy/0000-0001-7728-2569; du, zhenjiao/0000-0002-8492-4328; LI, Yonghui/0000-0003-4320-0806; Zhao, Jikai/0000-0002-0119-8640; Hong, Shan/0000-0002-1713-6583													0733-5210	1095-9963				MAR	2022	104								103432	10.1016/j.jcs.2022.103432	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2022.103432		FEB 2022											WOS:000788729600010

In-field evaporative protection for dryland wheat and lentil crops using polymers	JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE												In semi-arid cropping regions where rainfall is variable, stored soil water is important for reducing the impacts of dry periods; however, in-season evaporation limits yield potential. We tested the productivity benefits of protecting wheat and lentil crops from evaporation using inter-row polymer cover, when grown in southern Australia. For wheat, white polyvinyl chloride (PVCw) increased yield by 50% (561 kg/ha) and 11% (408 kg/ha) for decile 2 (2018) and 3 (2019) seasonal rainfall respectively; and for lentil, yield increases were 20% (443 kg/ha) in 2019. A sprayable alginate polymer increased wheat yield by 8% (310 kg/ha). Total water use for wheat in 2018 was reduced (17 mm) for PVCw and water use efficiency (WUE) significantly increased from 7 to 11 kg/ha/mm, whereas in 2019, WU was greater (47 mm) for PVCw, but WUE was equivalent to the control (similar to 15 kg/ha/mm). Colour of the PVC modified the light available to the crop and canopy temperature, where a highly reflective inter-row cover (albedo 0.44) increased wheat yield (similar to 487 kg/ha). For the future, formulations of highly reflective polymers applied in-season within dryland cropping enterprises are likely to provide production advantages, although logistical viability of application and potential environmental implications may define impediments to adoption.

However, little is known about the contribution of these two mechanisms to grain yield in old and modern wheat genotypes. Here, pot and field experiments were carried out to characterize and compare the mechanisms of drought avoidance and drought tolerance, and determine their differential contributions to the yield in six wheat genotypes. The pot experiment results demonstrated that the old genotypes acquired a better avoidance ability to adapt to drought stress. These avoidance abilities include larger root systems, lower leaf areas, low stomatal conductance, pale green leaf colour, higher degrees of leaf rolling and leaf waxiness. The modern genotypes displayed stronger drought tolerance advantages, such as high osmotic adjustment and antioxidant enzyme activity, and a smaller root system. Our field experiment further showed that under severe water-deficit conditions, the old genotypes with stronger drought avoidance traits had higher yields and water use efficiency (WUEg), whereas the modern genotypes with strong drought tolerance characteristics produced higher yields and had higher WUEg under mild and intermediate water deficits. The results indicate that the relative contribution of drought tolerance and drought avoidance to grain yield depends to a large extent on the degree of drought stress and genotypes. Understanding the differential plant response depending on genotype and drought stress may help plant breeders develop drought-resistant varieties suitable for drought-prone environments under anticipated climate change scenarios.

Here, we reviewed the comprehensive technical strategies including conserving water to combine both increased agricultural productivity and resource conservation; enquiring into how crop plants respond to drought through morphological, physiological, and molecular modifications that occur in all plant organs; breeding for drought tolerance where there is a delineated stress environment and genotype x environment interactions are stable; effective conservation of rainfall and high efficiency of use. In addition, we discussed the preponderance of biological water-saving measures, which embraces improvements in WUE and drought tolerance, by genetic improvement and physiological regulation.

As over fertilization is economically and environmentally undesirable, and crop yield and the resulting returns for N input are uncertain when rainfall variability is high, optimizing N management according to precipitation during fallow season is vital for efficient crop water use and high yield in dryland rainfed farming systems. Results show that the nitrogen treatment rate of 180 treatment significantly increased the tiller percentage rate, and the leaf area index at anthesis, the jointing anthesis, anthesis maturity dry matter, and nitrogen accumulation was closely related to yield. N150 treatment compared to N180 treatment significantly increased the percentage of ear-bearing tiller by 7%, dry substance accretion from jointing to anthesis by 9%, and yield by 17% and 15%, respectively. Our study has important implications for the assessment of the effects of fallow precipitation, as well as for the sustainable development of dryland agriculture in the Loess Plateau. Our results indicate that adjusting N fertilizer inputs based on summer rainfall variation could enhance wheat yield in rainfed farming systems.

Crop residue cover dynamics for wind erosion control in a dryland, no-till system	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Among the benefits of crop residues is their influence on reducing soil wind erosion. Residue height, diameter, and soil surface cover influence wind speeds and soil susceptibility to wind erosion events. Understanding the role of crop residue type in maximizing residue coverage through time can inform management for improved residue retention, and wind erosion models for better simulation of the residue decomposition process. We used the Dryland Agroecosystem Project (DAP), a long-term, dryland, no-till systems experiment at multiple locations in eastern Colorado, to examine differences between winter annual grain and summer annual forage crop residue dynamics. The DAP utilizes wheat-based rotations plus continuously cropped grain-forage and forage-only rotations. For this study, we focused on residue dynamics of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) and forage crop (Sorghum bicolor and Setaria italica) residues at two locations in eastern Colorado and following two harvest seasons (2014 and 2015). Decomposition days (DD), a calculation that factors in temperature and rainfall to estimate cumulative conditions that favor decomposition, were used to normalize climate conditions across sites and years. Counts of postharvest standing stems, stem diameters, and residue heights were measured, as was soil surface coverage. Soil cover measurements were used to estimate the length of time before soil surface cover fell below a 30% coverage threshold and to model residue persistence. Results showed that winter wheat consistently produced more residue cover immediately after harvest, and cover also persisted almost twice as long as forage crop residues. The hypothesis that residue cover could be represented using an exponential decay model was supported for forage sorghum and forage millet, while wheat residue maintained postharvest coverage of the soil for a period of time before beginning to decline and followed a quadratic decay model. The combined effects of standing stem density, initial residue cover, and coverage longevity point to wheat being a valuable protector against wind erosion in these systems. The different residue trajectories by crop type suggest that shifts in crop rotations within no-till management systems can have important implications for wind erosion control in the semiarid Great Plains.																			0022-4561	1941-3300				MAY-JUN	2022	77	3					221	229		10.2489/jSWC.2022.00005	http://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jSWC.2022.00005													WOS:000798841800001

One potential combination involves tristability between a patterned state and two different uniform states. Using a simplified version of the Gilad-Meron model for dryland ecosystems, we study the organization, in bifurcation terms, of the localized structures arising in tristable regimes. These states are generally related to the concept of wave front locking and appear in the form of spots and gaps of vegetation. We find that the coexistence of localized spots and gaps, within tristable configurations, yields the appearance of hybrid states. We also study the emergence of spatiotemporal localized states consisting of a portion of a periodic pattern embedded in a uniform Hopf-like oscillatory background in a subcritical Turing-Hopf dynamical regime.

Dryland cover crop soil health benefits are maintained with grazing in the US High and Central Plains	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Cover crops are important for soil conservation efforts but can compete with cash crops for limited water in dryland agricultural systems. Grazing cover crops may provide additional income to improve the profitability of cover cropped systems, but the effect of grazing cover crops on soil health remains poorly understood in semiarid regions. We conducted on-farm research to examine the short-term effects of grazed and un-grazed springplanted cover crops compared to full summer fallow on soil health metrics and wheat yields across ten no-till, dryland producer fields over two years in eastern Colorado, western Kansas and western Nebraska, USA. Soils were evaluated at cover crop termination following two to three months of growth for differences in a suite of soil physical and chemical properties. Grazed and un-grazed cover crops increased soil aggregation relative to summer fallow by 30-50%. Surface bulk density (0-5 cm) decreased by 4% with un-grazed cover crops, while bulk density under grazed cover crop was similar to fallow. Soil moisture in the top180 cm depth was reduced by 4?22 % with cover crops, with the greatest water depletion occurring below 30 cm, and grazing did not appear to affect soil moisture compared to un-grazed cover crops. Both cover crop treatments reduced wheat yields by roughly 20 %. The short-term improvements to key soil health metrics with cover crops were largely maintained with grazing, indicating the potential for livestock integration as a management option to offset the short-term yield impacts of cover crop moisture use in water-limited environments.

In this work, we focused on the conventional tillage practice and straw return practice used in the spring maize production system of this region and compared them by the addition of 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) to explore the N2O emission mechanism of the farmland. Compared with conventional farming, straw return significantly increased the N2O emissions from the soil. Soil pH had important effects on soil N2O emissions through its influence on the ammonia oxidizer community. In addition, DMPP was used to distinguish N2O emissions driven by ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), and the results showed that AOB were the dominant factor regulating N2O emissions after receiving nitrogen from an external source in dryland farming calcareous soil. Through the analyses of soil AOB community composition and the aggregated boosted tree (ABT) model for N2O emissions, Nitrosospira Cluster 3a.2 was found to be the main driving force of soil N2O emissions in AOB communities. These findings will help better understand the physiochemical and biological mechanisms underlying the N2O emissions of agricultural soils and provide insight for reducing the negative impact of agricultural production systems on the ecological environment.																			0167-1987	1879-3444				OCT	2023	234								105820	10.1016/j.still.2023.105820	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2023.105820		JUL 2023											WOS:001040256200001

However, little is known about the long-term interactive effects of cover crops and residue retention on yield of the cash crops and environmental outcomes in dryland cropping systems under climate change. We used the pre-validated APSIM model, driven by statistically downscaled daily climate data from 27 Global Climate Models (GCMs) under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP245 and SSP585), to assess the combined influences of cowpea cover crops and three residue retention levels on soil water balance, soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N) dynamics, crop yield and gross margin across six crop rotation systems during the historical period (1985-2020), near future (2021-2056), and far future (2057-2092) in southeast Australia. Our results showed that, on average, cover crops decreased soil moisture on the day of sowing the succeeding cash crop (by 22%), but led to greater SOC stock (21%), reduced N loss through leaching (71%), and enhanced N uptake and yield of cereals, but decreased N uptake and yield of field pea. The effects of cover crops on yield and gross margin became more positive in the far future under both SSPs, which may be attributed to the SOC increase and greater N availability in the long term. These benefits were more evident under residue removal due to the partly compensatory effects from cover crop residues. Furthermore, cover crops were profitable in the wetter parts of the study region (east), but reduced gross margin in the drier west due to depletion of soil water reserves for the next cash crop. We conclude that particularly where residues are removed, the long-term adoption of cowpea cover crops could be a potential practice to sustain crop productivity with environmental co-benefits under climate change in the wetter parts of the dryland cropping region of southeast Australia.

Louis; Marek, Gary; Brauer, David			Trends in Runoff From Dryland, Cropped Fields on the Texas High Plains, and Implications for Their Management	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS												Capturing precipitation as soil moisture is essential for successful dryland crop production, especially in semi-arid regions. Runoff is a loss of precipitation that does not result in increased soil moisture. Therefore, understanding the factors affecting runoff from cropped fields is important to successful dryland farming. Runoff frequency and volume were assessed using data from 1990 to 2009 from a long-term wheat-sorghum-fallow rotation near Bushland, Texas (USA), an area with an annual precipitation of similar to 500 mm and pan evaporation rate of over 2,000 mm. The likelihood that a rainfall event generated runoff increased with increasing rainfall volume such that all storms in excess of 50 mm yielded runoff. Runoff volume also increased with storm intensity. Rainfall in the preceding week was positively related to runoff volume. Runoff tended to be greater in no-till plots as compared to stubble mulched plots. During El Nino phase of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation the number of precipitations during the months of December through February tended to be higher. During La Nina phase of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation the number of precipitations during the months of November through January, respectively, tended to be lower. There also was a tendency for rainfall events during the El Nino phase to be of greater volume. However, the data did not support the hypothesis that greater winter rainfall with the El Nino event was associated with greater runoff. Therefore, greater rainfall during the El Nino phases should have been available for crop production. These results are discussed with regarding crop management practices for the Texas High Plains.																				2571-581X				OCT 30	2020	4								529319	10.3389/fsufs.2020.529319	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2020.529319													WOS:000590598600001

Intra-seasonal rainfall variability and herbivory affect the interaction outcome of two dryland plant species	ECOSPHERE												Increases in drought frequency in combination with overgrazing may result in degradation of (semi-) arid ecosystems. Facilitative interactions between plants are a key mechanism in preventing degradation, but it is poorly understood how they respond to increased stress by combined drought and herbivory. In this study, we used an ecohydrological model, to simulate the plant growth of two plant species interacting with each other under different rainfall and herbivory pressure scenarios. The functional traits of the two modeled plants were based on a prior field experiment in southeastern Spain, in which an unpalatable "nurse" species protected a palatable protege' species from herbivory. Moreover, the nurse species was more drought-resistant; that is, it had a lower wilting point, whereas the protege species had a higher optimal growth rate. Firstly, we investigated the coexistence of the two plant species growing under a single limiting resource, focusing on the effect of intra-seasonal rainfall variability. We found that longer periods without rainfall within the wet season resulted in stable coexistence, whereas nearly constant rainfall led to competitive exclusion of the protege by the nurse species. Secondly, we investigated how plant interactions varied along our studied gradients. Using the neighbor effect intensity and importance indices, we found that competitive effects increased with more constant rainfall. Moreover, higher herbivory rates resulted in increased facilitative effects of the nurse on the protege species, but facilitative effects could only prevail over competitive effects under currently observed or higher intra-seasonal rainfall variability. This study highlights the relevance of intra-seasonal rainfall variability in explaining coexistence of species in dryland ecosystems and shows that increasing intra-seasonal rainfall variability or herbivory pressure can result in more facilitative effects from a nurse species. This information is crucial to obtain a better insight into the long-term coexistence of species, and the resulting stability of dryland ecosystems in response to future climate change.

Because of the arid conditions, dryland soils are characterized by salt accumulation. Although salt-affected soils are unsuitable for agriculture, some arid lands have been cultivated for a long time. However, especially in the last decades, because of the increasingly warmer climatic condi-tions and human migration toward favorable environments, a pro-gressive abandonment and degradation of drylands has occurred. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the effects of cultivation on saline soils to develop appropriate soil management techniques to ensure their fertility. This work aims to evaluate the evolution of salinization from currently cultivated soils to soils that have been abandoned for different lengths of time in arid areas of central Tunisia. Morphological and physicochemical properties of the studied soils indicated that the cultivation, through irrigation and the presence of soil cover, reduced salt accumulation in the upper soil horizons. Salt leaching towards deeper horizons and depressed evaporation, which reduced capillary rising, maintained electrical conductivity within tolerable values for most crops. Conversely, the abandonment of previously cultivated fields com-promised soil fertility, threatening soil conservation and stabiliza-tion of agricultural production in the medium to long term.																			1125-4718	2039-6805					2023	18	2							2186	10.4081/ija.2023.2186	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/ija.2023.2186													WOS:001057847200003
J	Brown, RF; Collins, SL				Brown, Renee F.; Collins, Scott L.			As above, not so below: Long-term dynamics of net primary production across a dryland transition zone	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Drylands are key contributors to interannual variation in the terrestrial carbon sink, which has been attributed primarily to broad-scale climatic anomalies that disproportionately affect net primary production (NPP) in these ecosystems. Current knowledge around the patterns and controls of NPP is based largely on measurements of aboveground net primary production (ANPP), particularly in the context of altered precipitation regimes. Limited evidence suggests belowground net primary production (BNPP), a major input to the terrestrial carbon pool, may respond differently than ANPP to precipitation, as well as other drivers of environmental change, such as nitrogen deposition and fire. Yet long-term measurements of BNPP are rare, contributing to uncertainty in carbon cycle assessments. Here, we used 16 years of annual NPP measurements to investigate responses of ANPP and BNPP to several environmental change drivers across a grassland-shrubland transition zone in the northern Chihuahuan Desert. ANPP was positively correlated with annual precipitation across this landscape; however, this relationship was weaker within sites. BNPP, on the other hand, was weakly correlated with precipitation only in Chihuahuan Desert shrubland. Although NPP generally exhibited similar trends among sites, temporal correlations between ANPP and BNPP within sites were weak. We found chronic nitrogen enrichment stimulated ANPP, whereas a one-time prescribed burn reduced ANPP for nearly a decade. Surprisingly, BNPP was largely unaffected by these factors. Together, our results suggest that BNPP is driven by a different set of controls than ANPP. Furthermore, our findings imply belowground production cannot be inferred from aboveground measurements in dryland ecosystems. Improving understanding around the patterns and controls of dryland NPP at interannual to decadal scales is fundamentally important because of their measurable impact on the global carbon cycle. This study underscores the need for more long-term measurements of BNPP to improve assessments of the terrestrial carbon sink, particularly in the context of ongoing environmental change.

Ekrem			Modeling fate and transport of pesticides from dryland agriculture using SWAT model	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The aim of this study was to understand pesticide fate and transport from dryland agriculture in a major drinking water basin using SWAT and to identify critical source areas in the basin. Hydrological calibration results indicated satisfactory simulation of hydrologic processes within the catchment. Long term average observed sediment values (0.16 ton/ha) were compared with the annual average simulated SWAT outputs (0.22 ton/ha). Generally, the simulated concentrations were higher than the observed values, but the distribution pattern and trends were similar among the months. Average concentrations in water were 0.036 mu g/L and 0.006 mu g/L for fenpropimorph and chlorpyrifos, respectively. Transfer rates of pesticides from landscape to rivers showed that 0.36% of fenpropimorph and 0.19% of the applied amount of chlorpyrifos were exported to the river. Higher amount of fenpropimorph transport from land to the reach was attributed to its lower Koc (soil adsorption co-efficient) value compared to chlorpyrifos. Higher amounts from HRUs were observed in the application month (April) and following month (May) for fenpropimorph, while the months after September showed higher amounts for chlorpyrifos. The specific HRUs (Hydrological Response Units) located in sub-basins 3, 5, 9 and 11 presented highest dissolved pesticide amounts, while HRUs in sub-basins 4 and 11 exhibited highest concen-trations for adsorbed pesticides. Best management practices (BMPs) were recommended in critical subbasins to protect the watershed. Despite the limitations, the results demonstrate the potential contributions of modeling in terms of assessing pesticide loadings, critical zones and application timing.

Controlling Stormwater Runoff That Limits Water Availability and Dryland Crop Productivity	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS												Continued pumping for irrigation from the non-recharging Ogallala aquifer in Kansas and Texas is unsustainable. Reducing risks for dryland wheat (Triticum aestivum L) and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] production, which depends exclusively on precipitation to meet water demand is critical for future adoption. Stormwater runoff reduces the amount of precipitation available to crops, but management practices to minimize runoff concomitantly increase the opportunity time for infiltration and improve precipitation storage as soil water for crop use. Our objectives in this study were to evaluate tillage, slope and the effects of contour or with-slope farming on runoff, soil water at planting, and the growth and yield of wheat and sorghum grown in the 3 years wheat-sorghum-fallow (WSF) rotation. Long-term, 1983 to present, runoff was measured from gauged terraced and contour farmed fields managed in the WSF rotation with no-tillage (NT) or stubble-mulch (SM) tillage. We found significantly greater mean cumulative runoff during fallow for NT than for SM but only for the 1.8% terrace slopes., The corresponding soil water with NT increased by a significant similar to 27 mm over SM due to reduced evaporation but generally did not differ due to slope. Wheat yield decreased significantly as slope decreased from 1.8 to 1.2% but exhibited no yield response tillage. In contrast, grain sorghum yields were greater with NT than SM tillage residue management. Farming along the contour or slope manifested no differences in soil water, crop grain yield, or water use; however, they did increased significantly with no tillage for sorghum but not wheat. We conclude that management of tillage was more effective than slope effects in increasing water availability to crops because of evaporation reduction with crop residue.

Farmers have developed minimum tillage systems and no-till systems. This study carefully measured SOC at three sites where long-term, randomized, replicated studies compared minimum tillage and no-till ro-tations in the low-precipitation inland Pacific Northwest, USA. To overcome seasonal, annual, and rotational effects, a soil sample was taken from each plot monthly for three years. The top 250 kg m-2 dry soil mass (representing the 0-to 20-cm depth) from each core was analyzed for SOC. Averages of monthly samples revealed the tilled treatment had 7.21 g kg-1 of SOC compared to 7.04 for the no-till treatment (p < 0.004). Examining variation month-to-month, 93% of sample variation was due to sample date, and 7% due to blocks (replications) within sites. Of 77 individual site-by-date samples, only six produced significant t-tests (p < 0.05) but SOC differences were 46-31 in favor of tillage and those 46 had larger differences. Power calculations estimated 34-100 samples would be required to detect a relative difference of 5% given the data's standard deviation. Soil water and soil temperature to 30 cm was measured at the time of sampling, and while no-till more often had greater water, temperature differences were inconsistent. We conclude that no-till did not result in more soil carbon in these systems and judicious tillage is an option for sustainable production.

However, how phosphorus (P) addition regulates the responses of the plant-soil-microbe system to N deposition in dryland ecosystems remains unclear.MethodsTwo-year nutrient addition experiments, i.e., P addition rates ranging from 0 to 16 g P m(-2) yr(-1) combined with 5 g N m(-2) yr(-1), were performed to determine the effects on plant traits, soil properties, and bacterial communities in an alkaline desert steppe of Northwest China.ResultsUnder 5 g N center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1), the low-dose of P addition rates (< 2 g m(-2) yr(-1)) can help maintain higher aboveground biomass and diversity. A C-3 herb (Artemisia scoparia) became progressively dominant with increasing P rates, accompanied by the loss of Fabaceae and Amaranthaceae species. Moreover, increased P rates had important implications for plant nutrient characteristics and soil properties under simulated N deposition. Notably, the alpha-diversity and structure of the soil bacterial community exhibited no significant response to nutrient addition, suggesting that the bacterial community was more resistant to nutrient addition than the plant community, which was relatively more sensitive. Furthermore, the bacterial community composition was jointly influenced by plant traits and soil properties.ConclusionsOur results suggest that dryland prokaryotic microbes are more resistant to P addition under simulated N deposition than plant communities.					方, 昭/Q-1197-2016	方, 昭/0000-0001-9276-3096													0032-079X	1573-5036				AUG	2023	489	1-2					593	611		10.1007/s11104-023-06043-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-023-06043-1		MAY 2023											WOS:000990983800002

Predicting changes in bee assemblages following state transitions at North American dryland ecotones	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Drylands worldwide are experiencing ecosystem state transitions: the expansion of some ecosystem types at the expense of others. Bees in drylands are particularly abundant and diverse, with potential for large compositional differences and seasonal turnover across ecotones. To better understand how future ecosystem state transitions may influence bees, we compared bee assemblages and their seasonality among sites at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (NM, USA) that represent three dryland ecosystem types (and two ecotones) of the southwestern U.S. (Plains grassland, Chihuahuan Desert grassland, and Chihuahuan Desert shrubland). Using passive traps, we caught bees during two-week intervals from March-October, 2002-2014. The resulting dataset included 302 bee species and 56 genera. Bee abundance, composition, and diversity differed among ecosystems, indicating that future state transitions could alter bee assemblage composition in our system. We found strong seasonal bee species turnover, suggesting that bee phenological shifts may accompany state transitions. Common species drove the observed trends, and both specialist and generalist bee species were indicators of ecosystem types or months; these species could be sentinels of community-wide responses to future shifts. Our work suggests that predicting the consequences of global change for bee assemblages requires accounting for both within-year and among-ecosystem variation.

J	Chaabouni, S; Kallel, A; Houborg, R				Chaabouni, Sihem; Kallel, Abdelaziz; Houborg, Rasmus			Improving retrieval of crop biophysical properties in dryland areas using a multi-scale variational RTM inversion approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Optical radiative transfer models (RTM) are used to study the relationship between vegetation biophysical properties and corresponding canopy reflectances. In this paper, a RTM is inverted with satellite based surface reflectance observations to estimate key vegetation biophysical properties such as leaf area index (LAI) and leaf chlorophyll content (Cab). The complexity of model inversion makes model optimization challenging, particularly in dryland areas where the vegetation signal may have become confounded by bright soil backgrounds. Add to this, general difficulties in separating vegetation properties contributing to the combined surface reflectance signal. In this study, using a Bayesian approach, the inversion approach is written as a cost function to minimize. The high non-linearity of the RTM makes the analytical resolution of the optimization unpractical. To overcome this problem, a new multi-scale variational inversion approach is proposed. It solves progressively the inversion problem by first simplifying it, then solving it, and then coming back progressively to the original inversion problem. The approach is tested over a dryland irrigated agricultural system composed of fields of alfalfa, Rhodes grass, carrots and maize. Validation is done comparing results to in-situ measurements and other commonly used retrieval methods. The retrieved properties are shown to be in good agreement with in-situ observations of Cab (RMSE = 0.2 mu g cm(-2) and R2 = 89%) and LAI (RMSE = 0.18 m(2) m(-2) and R2 = 92%), which is shown to be an improvement over other traditional variational techniques (Gradient, Newton, LUT and QNT).																			1569-8432	1872-826X				FEB	2021	94								102220	10.1016/j.jag.2020.102220	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2020.102220													WOS:000593989200007

For this reason, the relationships between photosynthesis, N use efficiency (NUE), and related traits and grain yield, gluten quality, and the related traits of 11 representative wheat genotypes in the 2018-2021 cropping years were examined. The results show that the grain weights per spike accounted for 58.7% and 42.4% of genetic variations in the grain yield and grain protein contents, respectively. Meanwhile, N accumulation at the maturity stage caused a 49.5% genetic variation in the grain protein contents. The gluten index of MY26 and NM101 significantly decreased with a decrease in the grain number per spike in the 2018-2019 cropping season. The precipitation reduced by 53.8% in the 2019-2020 cropping season, resulting in a gluten index that increased by 13.0%. CY25 and NM101 showed high gluten quality without reducing the yield due to the high net photosynthetic rate, big grain size, large leaf area index, and high grain number per spike, respectively. Our results indicated that increasing the grain weight per spike and individual N accumulation at the maturity stage via genotype selection for a big grain size, large leaf area index, and high net photosynthetic rate simultaneously improved the grain yield and gluten quality of dryland wheat. Moreover, the effect of the genotype-environment interaction on the gluten index was related to the N translocation regulated by canopy senescence, and N translocation was affected by the source N supply associated with the net photosynthetic rate and sink N demands in relation to the grain number per spike under dryland soil conditions.																				2073-4395				APR 29	2023	13	5							1283	10.3390/agronomy13051283	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13051283													WOS:000995476700001

Herbs are a critical component of the plant community of dryland ecosystems, but the importance of different life form groups of herbs is often overlooked in experiments on biodiversity-ecosystem multifunctionality. Hence, little is known about how the multiple attributes of diversity of different life form groups of herbs affect changes to the multifunctionality of ecosystems. MethodsWe investigated geographic patterns of herb diversity and ecosystem multifunctionality along a precipitation gradient of 2100 km in Northwest China, and assessed the taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional attributes of different life form groups of herbs on the multifunctionality. ResultsWe found that subordinate (richness effect) species of annual herbs and dominant (mass ratio effect) species of perennial herbs were crucial for driving multifunctionality. Most importantly, the multiple attributes (taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional) of herb diversity enhanced the multifunctionality. The functional diversity of herbs provided greater explanatory power than did taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity. In addition, the multiple attribute diversity of perennial herbs contributed more than annual herbs to multifunctionality. ConclusionsOur findings provide insights into previously neglected mechanisms by which the diversity of different life form groups of herbs affect ecosystem multifunctionality. These results provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and multifunctionality, and will ultimately contribute to multifunctional conservation and restoration programs in dryland ecosystems.					guo, hao/HJH-6905-2023														1664-462X					FEB 15	2023	14								1099110	10.3389/fpls.2023.1099110	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2023.1099110								36890885					WOS:000943768400001

Ecological refugia enhance biodiversity and crop production in dryland grain production systems	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Meeting global food demand while reducing biodiversity loss will require strategies that quantify and minimize conservation and production tradeoffs in agroecosystems. Ecological refugia (non-crop habitat patches) were identified in three dryland grain production systems in the Northern Great Plains and assessed for their capacity to enhance biodiversity, crop yield, and crop quality. A radial design of six 100-200 meter transects originating from the refugia and extending into crop fields was used to assess trends in plant and arthropod diversity with increasing distance from the refuge center. Plant species diversity significantly declined with distance from established refugia into crop fields in all years sampled and from a newly established refuge by the third year of data collection. Arthropod taxon diversity declined significantly with distance from refugia on two organic farms but not on a conventional farm. Fields with a refuge hosted a higher abundance of arthropods belonging to Coleoptera than fields without a refuge. Distance from refuge was the most important variable explaining grain yield and grain quality in a random forest model. Yield significantly declined with distance from refugia while grain nutritional quality, based on protein content, iron concentration, and polyphenol concentration, significantly increased with distance from refugia. Overall, ecological refugia enhanced farmland biodiversity and provided tradeoffs for marketable crop production. Moving forward, ecological refugia could serve as a multiobjective conservation practice to integrate food production and conservation goals in agroecosystems.

Both human activities and climate change have driven forest expansion in parts of dryland regions. Afforestation has been implemented widely to enhance carbon sequestration and benefit the ecological environment of many global drylands. However, the potential and available afforestation space in drylands is uncertain due to the conflicts between additional forest areas and available water. How afforestation will affect the potential for forest carbon stock is also unclear. This paper assessed the future spatial distribution of affores-tation and potential forest carbon stock in a typical dryland region, the Yellow River Basin (YRB), which has experi-enced rapid afforestation and high human activity pressure over the past several decades. Combining the future land use change model (FLUS) and local important development planning, we simulated future afforestation distributions and estimated potential forest carbon stock under the ecological restoration, urban expansion, and cultivated land pro-tection scenarios. The afforestation carbon stock was predicted by considering the dynamic change trends of the ma-ture forest, the immature forest, and new afforestation. The results demonstrated that the potential afforestation area would be limited to 4000 km2 in the YRB accounting for less than one-twentieth of the total forest area. Accord-ingly, the maximum potential forest carbon stock would increase only 59.5 x 106 t. These findings implies that affor-estation programs in drylands should further consider the optimum allocation of afforestation space and the balance between carbon and water in drylands, especially under a changing climate with increasing human activities.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				FEB 1	2023	858		2						159817	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159817	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159817		NOV 2022						36334672					WOS:000898781500008

Climate-Driven Shifts in Soil Temperature and Moisture Regimes Suggest Opportunities to Enhance Assessments of Dryland Resilience and Resistance	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Assessing landscape patterns in climate vulnerability, as well as resilience and resistance to drought, disturbance, and invasive species, requires appropriate metrics of relevant environmental conditions. In dryland systems of western North America, soil temperature and moisture regimes have been widely utilized as an indicator of resilience to disturbance and resistance to invasive plant species by providing integrative indicators of long-term site aridity, which relates to ecosystem recovery potential and climatic suitability to invaders. However, the impact of climate change on these regimes, and the suitability of the indicator for estimating resistance and resilience in the context of climate change have not been assessed. Here we utilized a daily time-step, process-based, ecosystem water balance model to characterize current and future patterns in soil temperature and moisture conditions in dryland areas of western North America, and evaluate the impact of these changes on estimation of resilience and resistance. Soil temperature increases in the twenty-first century are substantial, relatively uniform geographically, and robust across climate models. Higher temperatures will expand the areas of mesic and thermic soil temperature regimes while decreasing the area of cryic and frigid temperature conditions. Projections for future precipitation are more variable both geographically and among climate models. Nevertheless, future soil moisture conditions are relatively consistent across climate models for much of the region. Projections of drier soils are expected in most of Arizona and New Mexico, as well as the central and southern U.S. Great Plains. By contrast, areas with projections of increasing soil moisture include northeastern Montana, southern Alberta and Saskatchewan, and many areas dominated by big sagebrush, particularly the Central and Northern Basin and Range and the Wyoming Basin ecoregions. In addition, many areas dominated by big sagebrush are expected to experience pronounced shifts toward cool season moisture, which will create more area with xeric moisture conditions and less area with ustic conditions. In addition to indicating widespread geographic shifts in the distribution of soil temperature and moisture regimes, our results suggest opportunities for enhancing the integration of these conditions into a quantitative framework for assessing climate change impacts on dryland ecosystem resilience and resistance that is responsive to long-term projections.

We used 2 years (2017-2019) of data to investigate soil nitrogen dynamics, production, water utilization, and fallow efficiency when forage rape (Brassica campestris L.; R) and common vetch (Vicia sativa L.; V) were planted in a 3-month summer fallow of the W-F-W-F cropping system. Three cropping systems were comprised of winter wheat-summer fallow-winter wheat-summer fallow (W-F-W-F), winter wheat-forage rape-winter wheat-forage rape (W-R-W-R), and winter wheat-forage rape-winter wheat-common vetch (W-R-W-V). The results showed that the annual forage planting decreased the average NO3--N content by 54.8% compared with the W-F-W-F cropping system. Compared with the W-F-W-F cropping system, planting annual forage in summer fallow increased the average system forage production by 4.93 t ha-1. Local total annual precipitation can meet crop-water requirements, and the limiting factor for agricultural production was the drought due to the uneven seasonal distribution of precipitation. In comparison to the W-F-W-F cropping system, annual forage planting decreased the average available soil moisture storage by 50.3 mm above the 80 cm soil layer. Compared with that in the W-R-W-R (23.21 t ha-1) and W-F-W-F (30.25 t ha-1) cropping systems, the crop productivity in the W-R-W-V cropping system (33.23 t ha-1) was relatively stable and high because the reduction in subsequent winter wheat yield (2.96 t ha-1) was adequately offset by the forage yield (5.15 t ha-1). Adding forage rape to the W-F-W-F cropping system decreased system crop-water productivity (CWP) by 40.9%. However, the CWP, precipitation use efficiency (PUE), and soil nitrate in the W-R-W-V cropping system increased by 30.4, 30.1, 110.9, and 82.0%, respectively, compared with those in the W-R-W-R cropping system. Therefore, the W-R-W-V cropping system is recommended for better water and fertility management as well as grain and forage production in semiarid regions. However, further study is required to involve drought years for better evaluation of the effect of long-term precipitation variability on the crop productivity.																				2571-581X				SEP 5	2023	7								1139453	10.3389/fsufs.2023.1139453	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1139453													WOS:001066315900001

However, few studies have assessed the nematode community under agricultural systems in cool semi-arid regions such as the U.S. northern Great Plains. We assessed soil nematode community structure of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and barley-pea (Pisum sativum L.) cropping systems from 2016 to 2018 in one tilled and two no-till field experiments under dryland management in central and southwestern Montana. Soils were sampled prior to planting in the spring and following harvest in late summer and nematodes were classified to genus level via microscopy. Both in season moisture stress and overwinter stress explained decline in nematodes in the central Montana no-till experiments, although consistent impacts of moisture or overwinter stress on nematodes were not detected in the tilled field experiment. Cropping system or sequence did not impact the nematode population (p > .1), but barley yield was positively correlated with larger nematode populations in both no-till experiments (r > .60). The percentage of fungivores were negatively correlated (r = -.42) to barley yield under tillage. Plant parasitic nematodes were positively correlated (r = .43) to barley yield under tillage. These results suggest that factors which enhance cereal crop growth and productivity rather than crop diversification drive short-term nematode community dynamics when crop rotations are established in cool semi-arid regions. Future work is needed to determine if cropping system changes can impact nematode populations after several years in cool semi-arid regions and, if so, what ecosystem services result from these transformations.

JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												This study aimed to evaluate the effects of five forage cactus genotypes ("Gigante," "Miuda," "IPA Sertania," "Orelha de Elefante Mexicana" [OCP], and "Orelha de Elefante Africana" [ACP]) in sheep. The goal was also to show the importance of energy content compared with other forages produced in dryland conditions. Five male sheep cannulated were randomized in a 5 x 5 Latin square design. The experimental diets contained a genotype of spineless forage cactus (440 g/kg of dry matter [DM]), alfalfa hay (585 g/kg DM), and a mineral mixture (15 g/kg DM). The "Gigante" diet promoted lower ruminal pH than the diet containing ACP. There was a lower ruminal ammonia nitrogen concentration observed in the "Gigante" and "Miuda" diets. The highest concentration was found in the "IPA Sertania" diet. The highest levels of microbial protein synthesis and efficiency were observed for the "IPA Sertania" diet. Except for the ACP cactus, the spineless forage cactus genotypes featured metabolizable energy content (2.29-2.39 Mcal/kg DM) that was higher than that of alfalfa hay. The spineless forage cactus is suggested to be the primary forage to adopt in semiarid areas due to its high nutritional value and its incomparable production of energy and water per area.

J	Sainju, UM; Liptzin, D; Ghimire, R; Dangi, S				Sainju, Upendra M.; Liptzin, Daniel; Ghimire, Rajan; Dangi, Sadikshya			Relationship between soil carbon and nitrogen, soil properties, and dryland crop yields	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important indicator of soil health, but its analysis requires a two-step process of measuring soil total carbon (STC) and inorganic carbon (SIC) in arid and semiarid regions. Determination of STC or soil total nitrogen (STN) for SOC can shorten the analytical process, which may be used for measuring soil health. We related STC, STN, SOC, and SIC to 62 soil properties and mean crop yields across years in two long-term (14- and 36-yr-old) experiments in the northern Great Plains. Treatments were rotations of till- and no-till spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), pea (Pisum sativum L.), and fallow with and without N fertilization. No-till continuous cropping (every year cropping) increased STC, STN, and SOC compared to till and no-till crop-fallow, with limited effect of N fertilization. Treatments had little effect on SIC. The STC correlated to 6, 7, and 28 more soil physical, chemical, biological, and biochemical properties than SOC, STN, and SIC, respectively. A combination of data from both experiments enhanced the relationships among STC, STN, SOC, and selected soil properties. The STC also more strongly related to mean crop yield across years than SOC, STN, and SIC. Because of rapid determination and sensitivity to management practices, STC can be used as a potential soil health indicator to relate to more soil properties and crop yields in dryland cropping systems in the semiarid northern Great Plains.

Using radiometrically calibrated data from two multispectral drone sensors (MicaSense RedEdge (MRE) and Parrot Sequoia (PS)) co-located with a transect of hyperspectral measurements (tramway) in the Chihuahuan desert (New Mexico, USA), we found a high degree of correspondence within individual drone data sets, but that reflectance measurements and vegetation indices varied between field, drone, and satellite sensors. In comparison to field spectra, MRE had a negative bias, while PS had a positive bias. In comparison to Sentinel2, PS showed the best agreement, while MRE had a negative bias for all bands. A variogram analysis of NDVI showed that ecological pattern information was lost at grains coarser than 1.8 m, indicating that drone-based multispectral sensors provide information at an appropriate spatial grain to capture the heterogeneity and spectral variability of this dryland ecosystem in a dry season state. Investigators using similar workflows should understand the need to account for biases between sensors. Modelling spatial and spectral upscaling between drone and satellite data remains an important research priority.

Geologic, geomorphic, and edaphic underpinnings of dryland ecosystems: Colorado Plateau landscapes in a changing world	ECOSPHERE												Drylands represent more than 41% of the global land surface and are at degradation risk due to land use and climate change. Developing strategies to mitigate degradation and restore drylands in the face of these threats requires an understanding of how drylands are shaped by not only soils and climate, but also geology and geomorphology. However, few studies have completed such a comprehensive analysis that relates spatial variation in plant communities to all aspects of the geologic-geomorphic-edaphic-plant-climate system. The focus of this study is the Colorado Plateau, a high-elevation dryland in the southwestern United States, which is particularly sensitive to future change due to climate vulnerability and increasing land-use pressure. Here, we examined 135 long-term vegetation-monitoring sites in three national parks and characterized connections between geology, geomorphology, soils, climate, and dryland plant communities. To first understand the geologic and geomorphic influences on soil formation and characteristics, we explore associations between soil pedons, bedrock geology, and geomorphology. Then, we characterize principal axes of variation in plant communities and ascertain controls and linkages between components of the edaphic-geomorphic system and plant community ordinations. Geologic and geomorphic substrate exerted controls on important properties of the soil profile, particularly depth, water-holding capacity, rockiness, salinity, and fine sands. Ordination identified five distinct plant communities and three primary axes of variation, representing gradients of woody- to herbaceous-dominated communities (Axis 1), saline scrublands to C-3 grasslands (Axis 2), and annual to perennial communities (Axis 3). Geology, geomorphology, and soil explained a large proportion of variation in Axis 1 (74%), while climate variables largely explained Axis 2 (68%), and Axis 3 was not well explained by the random forest models. The variables identified as most influential to each axis were, respectively: (1) soil depth; (2) aridity, lithology, and soil salinity; and (3) temperature and precipitation. We posit that Axis 3 represents a land degradation gradient due to historic grazing, likely exacerbated by dry conditions. Results provide a novel framework that links the geologic and geomorphic evolution of landscapes, with the distribution of soils and plant communities that can guide ecosystem management, exemplifying an approach applicable to drylands globally.

Monitoring Dryland Trees With Remote Sensing. Part A: Beyond CORONA-Historical HEXAGON Satellite Imagery as a New Data Source for Mapping Open-Canopy Woodlands on the Tree Level	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Monitoring woody cover by remote sensing is considered a key methodology towards sustainable management of trees in dryland forests. However, while modern very high resolution satellite (VHRS) sensors allow woodland mapping at the individual tree level, the historical perspective is often hindered by lack of appropriate image data. In this first study employing the newly accessible historical HEXAGON KH-9 stereo-panoramic camera images for environmental research, we propose their use for mapping trees in open-canopy conditions. The 2-4 feet resolution panchromatic HEXAGON satellite photographs were taken 1971-1986 within the American reconnaissance programs that are better known to the scientific community for their lower-resolution CORONA images. Our aim is to evaluate the potential of combining historical CORONA and HEXAGON with recent WorldView VHRS imagery for retrospective woodland change mapping on the tree level. We mapped all trees on 30 1-ha test sites in open-canopy argan woodlands in Morocco in the field and from the VHRS imagery for estimating changes of tree density and size between 1967/1972 and 2018. Prior to image interpretation, we used simulations based on unmanned aerial system (UAS) imagery for exemplarily examining the role of illumination, viewing geometry and image resolution on the appearance of trees and their shadows in the historical panchromatic images. We show that understanding these parameters is imperative for correct detection and size-estimation of tree crowns. Our results confirm that tree maps derived solely from VHRS image analysis generally underestimate the number of small trees and trees in clumped-canopy groups. Nevertheless, HEXAGON images compare remarkably well with WorldView images and have much higher tree-mapping potential than CORONA. By classifying the trees in three sizes, we were able to measure tree-cover changes on an ordinal scale. Although we found no clear trend of forest degradation or recovery, our argan forest sites show varying patterns of change, which are further analysed in Part B of our study. We conclude that the HEXAGON stereo-panoramic camera images, of which 670,000 worldwide will soon be available, open exciting opportunities for retrospective monitoring of trees in open-canopy conditions and other woody vegetation patterns back into the 1980s and 1970s.

In order to study the effects of dryland farming system on some agronomical and physiological traits of D. kotschyi, two separate experiments were conducted in three locations of, Mashad (Golmakan station), Quchan (5km in the northeast of city) and Bojnord (Sisab station) under normal irrigation and dryland farming systems in 2018. The collected data were combined analysis over three locations and mean comparisons were made using Tukey method. The results showed significant effects of locations for all of the traits except carbohydrate contents. Effect of farming system was also significant for all traits. Farming system by location interaction effects were significant for aerial fresh and dry weigh, 1000 seeds weight, proline, DPPH, flavonoid, protein, chlorophyll a, carotenoid, nitrogen and potassium. Result showed the location of Quchan had significantly higher mean values for many of traits followed by Mashad. In comparisons between two method of cultivations, the lower and higher values of plant height (20.6 vs. 25.3 cm), main branch (13.1 vs. 14.9 per plant), leaf area (38.9 vs. 48.3 mm2), flower number (14.6 vs. 23.1 per plant), fresh weight (295 vs. 888 g/plant), dry weight (80 vs. 244 g/plant), 1000 seeds weight (0.27 vs. 0.35 g), Protein (9.74 vs. 11.06%), chlorophyll a (7.47 vs. 8.19 mg g(-1)FW), carotenoid (0.08 vs. 0.11 mg g(-1)FW), nitrogen (1.43 vs. 1.77%) and phosphorus (13.89 vs. 20.79 ppm) were obtained in dryland and irrigation farming, respectively. In contrast, the higher and lower values of internode length (4.11 vs. 3.71 cm), proline (1.44 vs. 0.77 mg g(-1)FW), DPPH (0.39 vs. 0.19 mg g(-1)FW), phenol (0.83 vs. 0.67 mg g(-1)FW), flavonoid (0.60 vs. 0.47 mg g(-1)FW), carbohydrate (8.2 vs. 6.2 mg g(-1)FW), and potassium (4.2 vs. 3.7%) were obtained in dryland farming system.

Hornwort (Anthocerotopsida) spores in Late Quaternary wetland sediments and dryland soils, Rapa Nui (Easter Island)	PALYNOLOGY												Several paleoecological studies over the last decade examining plant microfossils in Late Quaternary wetland sediment cores and dryland soil samples from multiple sites on Rapa Nui found three distinct spore forms, comparable to the class Anthocerotopsida. To our knowledge, hornwort spores have not been noted specifically as such in previous or to date subsequent, published paleoecological Rapa Nui studies. As the spore descriptions in the studies were brief, without images, and reported in several separate articles, here we provide detailed descriptions and photomicrography of the spores, and comment on their distribution and dating in the sampled substrates and suggest botanical affinities. We identify two native Rapa Nui hornwort taxa, with possibly localised distributions, and another, possibly introduced taxon with widespread Rapa Nui distribution. All three taxa are associated with major landscape disturbance by people. As we cannot find any other descriptive studies of hornwort spores from east of and including French Polynesia, this study provides a platform for subsequent similar research in the region.																			0191-6122	1558-9188				JAN 2	2022	46	1							1965667	10.1080/01916122.2021.1965667	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01916122.2021.1965667		AUG 2021											WOS:000689663700001

Soil Water and Water Use in Long-Term Dryland Crop Rotations	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Dryland crop rotation systems are sustainable only if there is sufficient water available for profitable crop production. The objective of our study was to identify potential crop rotation systems for the central Great Plains and similar semiarid areas that increase soil water, fallow water accumulation, fallow efficiency, and water productivity of major crops. The study was conducted from 2000 through 2017 near Tribune, KS. Four summer crops [corn (Zea mays L.) (CR), grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) (GS), soybean (Glycine max L.) (SB), and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) (SF)] along with winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (W) were grown in 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-yr rotations, with most rotations including a fallow (F) phase. Rotations were W-CR-SB-F, W-F, WCR-SF-F, W-GS-F, W-SF-F, and W-CR-GS-F from 2000 through 2006 and W-CR-F, continuous GS, W-F, W-GSCR-F, W-GS-F, and W-CR-GS-F from 2008 through 2017. Results showed that available soil water (ASW) at corn planting was in the order W-CR-GS-F = W-CR-SB-F > W-CRSF-F for 2000-2006 period and ASW and water productivity were in the order W-CR-GS-F = W-CR-F > W-GS-CR-F for the 2008-2017 period. The ASW in the 30-150 cm profile depth at sorghum planting and crop water productivity were in the order W-GS-F > W-CR-GS-F for the 2000-2006 period and in the order W- GS-CR-F = W-GS-F > W-CR-GS-F = GS-GS for the 2008-2017 period. ASW at wheat planting and crop water productivity were greater in W- F and W-GS-F in the wheat-based rotations. Results consistently showed that with summer crop planting there was greater soil water following wheat than another summer crop.

Biomass production and carbon sequestration potential of neem (<i>Azadirachta indica</i> A. <i>Juss</i>) under dryland environment	RANGE MANAGEMENT AND AGROFORESTRY												Neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss) is a fast-growing evergreen tree species adopted to wide range of climatic condition and especially suitable for dryland areas. A study was conducted to quantify its potential for carbon sequestration. The study concentrated on estimating biomass and carbon stock of 10-year- old Azadirachta indica plantation under different diameter classes. Biomass production of neem was recorded maximum in root (258.1 t ha(-1)) followed by primary branch, secondary branch, stem and leaf under 20- 30 cm diameter class. The 10-year-old neem plantation showed carbon sequestration potential of about 31.82 kg C tree(-1) (88.15 t C ha(-1)) in above ground biomass and 17.97 kg C tree(-1) (49.78 t C ha(-1)) in below ground biomass. The maximum average CO2 equivalent was recorded in root followed by primary branch, secondary branch and stem. The carbon dioxide equivalent showed an increasing trend with increased diameter classes.																			0971-2070					DEC	2020	41	2					381	385																WOS:000645010100026

Seasonal carryover of water and effects on carbon dynamics in a dryland ecosystem	ECOSPHERE												Net primary productivity in arid and semiarid regions is controlled by water availability for which rainfall has been a commonly used proxy at annual scales. However, the hydrological partitioning occurring through the water balance can also shape both seasonal and annual net ecosystem productivity. In this study, we used 10 years of water and carbon flux measurements in a mixed shrubland watershed of the Chihuahuan Desert to investigate the seasonal variability and controls on net ecosystem production. Over this period, the site exhibited a bimodal rainfall regime with an average of 211 and 67 mm for the wet (July-December) and dry (January-June) periods of the year, respectively. During the wet season, soil infiltration and channel transmission losses led to an average of 35.8 mm of water stored in the subsurface for subsequent dry periods. By contrast, dry seasons consumed 30.3 mm of stored subsurface water to fulfill the ecosystem water demand, particularly during the springtime. In response, gross primary productivity occurred in equal amounts for both seasons, while ecosystem respiration was substantially higher during the wet season. This resulted in the mixed shrubland acting as an annual net sink of carbon (average of 153.2 g C m(-2) year(-1)) of which 65% occurred during the dry season. We determined that the wet season provided water in excess of vegetation demands in that season, a portion of which was stored in the watershed subsurface for subsequent use, leading to a legacy effect. Gross primary productivity during the dry season was dependent on carryover soil moisture accessed by deep-rooted shrubs. Our coordinated observations of water-carbon dynamics revealed that water availability during the wet season can sustain the annual ecosystem productivity by impacting the subsequent dry season carbon uptake.

However, there are few comprehensive evaluations on the temporal impacts of dryland-to-paddy conversion on soil quality. Based on principal component analysis (PCA) and soil quality index method (SQI), a minimum data set (MDS) was established to systematically evaluate the soil quality with different duration (0, 10, 20, 30 years) of dryland-to-paddy conversion in two main soil types (meadow and albic soil) in Sanjiang Plain. Conclusions are as follows: (1) The MDS was composed of soil organic carbon (SOC), available phosphorus (AP), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), available potassium (AK), fine sand (FS), coarse sand (CS), and pH. (2) In meadow soil, the SQI raised significantly in the first 10 years and reached the lowest in the 30 years (p < 0.05), and the SOC and AK were the main properties affecting SQI. (3) For albic soil, the SQI was stable within 20 years and then declined significantly in the 30 years (p < 0.05). The stable SQI within 20 years was attributed to increased SOC and downward pH and AK, while declined SOC (p < 0.05) resulted in the SQI decreasing in the 30 years. The finding can enable soil quality diagnosis and sustainable development of farmland related to dryland-to-paddy conversion in the typical black soil area in the future.

The case of irrigation as an adaptation strategy among the transitioning pastoralists and agro-pastoralists of Laikipia County, Kenya	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Irrigation as a climate-smart practice in agriculture is identified as a strategy accompanying the transformation witnessed where the dryland community is transitioning from pastoralism to agropastoralism. This community is learning and nurturing new adaptation strategies to adapt to the diminishing yet crucial natural resources. This article identifies the socio-economic factors that encourage or hinder the uptake of irrigation as an adaptation strategy among the dryland community in Laikipia County, Kenya. The Heckman probit model is used first, to assess a total of 494 household on how they perceive climate change, and secondly it identifies the drivers that either encourage these households or hinder them from adopting irrigation as an adaptation strategy. Results indicate that 80% of the households investigated experience the indicators of climate change, out of this, 32% adopted irrigation as an adaptation strategy to climatic changes among other livelihood changes. The drivers encouraging this uptake are identified as: quality of land for food production (1.152**), assistance received from government (0.906**), large livestock herd size, governance of community land tenure (1.556**) and agronomic information (1.094***). There is low possibility of adopting irrigation by older household heads (-0.0219*) and those with small livestock herds (-0.473*). The sustainable development of agriculture promoted in these dryland regions requires a broader policy response that looks at the sustainability of irrigation as an adaption strategy in the dryland.

Straw return resulted in a 13.5% increase in soil respiration, a 9.4% increase in soil moisture, a 10.4% increase in crop yield, a 18.9% increase in SOC (soil organic carbon), and a 2.6% decrease in soil temperature. Compared to conventional tillage without straw return treatment, the increase in soil respiration in response to straw return was closely related to modifications in soil temperature, soil moisture, SOC, and crop yield (P < 0.05). The contribution of the different drivers to increases in soil respiration in response to straw return showed a trend of crop yield > soil temperature > SOC > soil moisture. In addition, straw mulching, crop planting system, tillage method, and fertilization modified the effect of straw return on soil respiration. The increase in soil respiration was less when straw was used as a mulch (12.9%), compared to when it was incorporated into the soil (18.8%). The cropping system also influenced the effect of straw return on soil respiration and was increased by 21.1% in inter-crops, and by 17.3% and 11.0% in monocultures and rotations treatments, respectively. Our results also showed that the effect of straw return on soil respiration was larger in deep tillage treatments than in shallow tillage treatments (26.9% vs.18.7%). In addition, the effect of straw return on soil respiration was also larger in fertilized treatment compared to unfertilized one (12.7% vs. 0.5%). However, this depended on the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied rates and was higher (14.8%) with low (<300 kg ha(-1)) application rates compared to high (>= 300 kg ha(-1)) ones (2.5%). Therefore, in dryland agroecosystems in China, biological factors, especially those related to crop yield, may be a more important factor regulating the effect of straw return on soil respiration. However, straw mulching, crop planting system, tillage method, and fertilization can modify the effect of straw return on soil respiration.

Here we aim to disentangle the impacts of combinations of terracing and mulching on water use strategy and their response to extreme droughts in a rainfed jujube (Ziziphus jujubaMill.) plantation on the semiarid Loess Plateau of China, using 3-year in situ field observations. Pruned jujube branches and maize straw were mulched on half-moon terraces to form two combined treatments, referred to as JBT and MST, respectively. The efficacy of these two combinations on the water use strategy of jujube trees was compared with terracing alone (SHT) and control (no terrace). We found that under extreme drought there was clearly reduced soil water storage (SWS) for different treatments. However, the combined treatments showed significantly (p < .05) higher SWS than the SHT and control. Furthermore, the combined treatments enhanced soil water use in deep layers during both normal and drought years, thus helping jujube trees to resist droughts. Moreover, under extreme drought there was greatly reduced transpiration whereas for moderate drought increased transpiration at both seasonal and annual scales. Nonetheless, the combined treatments were associated with enhanced transpiration compared to the SHT and control during drought periods. Finally, jujube trees exhibited isohydric behavior which also helped them to cope with prolonged droughts. Overall, the findings here may provide insights into land management of dryland plantations worldwide under climate change.

We characterized 60 local landraces of dryland rice and three improved cultivars from EMBRAPAArroz e FeijAo for phenotypic diversity based on morphological characteristics. The landraces were collected in 27 rural communities of two municipalities in FWSC. Twenty-one morphological groups (MGs) were identified through the use of the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean clustering algorithm. Of these 21, 12 were represented by a single landrace. Grain morphology could be used both to distinguish among landraces and to identify different phenotypes within landraces. The geographical distribution of MGs seemed to be completely random. Of the 60 landraces, 35 presented a mixture of characteristics of the Indica and Japonica Groups; 24 presented only characteristics of the Group Indica; and four presented characteristics of Japonica. This finding is intriguing, since rice varieties adapted to dryland agriculture in Brazil generally have genic affinities to the Group Japonica. A clustering analysis based on both qualitative and quantitative characteristics identified four isolated populations and the formation of four groups (cophenetic correlation=0.82). Some landraces from this study are being subjected to evaluation for their agronomic potential, to be followed by individual selection with progeny testing. This breeding approach is being proposed as a tool to support in situ/on farm conservation of rice landraces in FWSC.

However, business-as-usual (BAU) intensification has reduced the ecological resilience of orchards. Agroforestry is considered to be an important method of realizing sustainable intensification of agroecosystems. However, the design of practical agroforestry systems in drylands remains poorly researched. We hypothesized that crop density is a key factor in designing dryland apple tree-based agroforestry systems. We carried out an experiment in apple orchards in the semiarid LOP, where the bioenergy crop canola (Brassica napus L.) was intercropped at low, medium, and high densities with row spacings of 25, 50, and 100 cm, respectively, to study its effects on water, carbon, and production. We found that intercropping of canola at different densities clearly decreased soil water content (SWC) in the top 60 cm soil layer at all sampling locations, reduced midday leaf water potential (psi(m)) and leaf water content (LWC), and caused apple trees to produce more fine roots at greater depths. However, intercropping did not affect SWC in soil layers below 60 cm. The SWC profiles, psi(m) and LWC, progressively recovered over the mulching period. Introduction of canola also significantly (p < 0.05) increased SOC content in the surface layer, an effect less visible in deeper layers, and increased the quality of apple fruit to varying degrees while not affecting apple yield measurably. Overall, higher intercropping density does not lead to severer water deficit but have better carbon sequestration benefit than lower density, and therefore seems more appropriate in our study site. Our findings provide solid evidence that agroforestry helps achieve sustainable intensification of dryland orchards.

However, the influence of land use on biocrusts and soil N dynamics in tropical drylands is un-known. We evaluated the influence of rainfed agriculture and firewood extraction on biocrust functional groups and soil N dynamics in a tropical dryland. We collected biocrusts in abandoned croplands resulting from rainfed agriculture and mesquite shrublands resulting from firewood extraction to measure the cover of heterocystous cyanobacteria, non-heterocystous cyanobacteria, cyanolichens, and chlorolichens. We also collected soil below biocrusts to evaluate soil N dynamics (total and available N, N transformation rates, microbial biomass N), energy availability (total C), and microbial activity (C mineralization). We evaluated the correlation between biocrust functional group cover and soil N dynamics, and between microbial activity and soil N dynamics. In abandoned croplands, heterocystous cyanobacteria had high cover and were associated to altered soil N dy-namics. In mesquite shrublands, cyanolichens had high cover and were associated to unaltered soil N dynamics. In this tropical dryland, both activities have contrasting changes in biocrust functional group cover and soil N dynamics, probably due to differences in energy availability and soil microenvironments for microbial activity under biocrusts.

J	Abel, C; Horion, S; Tagesson, T; Brandt, M; Fensholt, R				Abel, Christin; Horion, Stephanie; Tagesson, Torbern; Brandt, Martin; Fensholt, Rasmus			Towards improved remote sensing based monitoring of dryland ecosystem functioning using sequential linear regression slopes (SeRGS)	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												We present a method for remote sensing based monitoring of changes in dryland ecosystem functioning based on the assumption that an altered vegetation rainfall relationship (VRR) indicates changes in vegetation biophysical processes, potentially leading to changes in ecosystem functioning. We describe the VRR through a linear regression between integrated rainfall and vegetation productivity (using NDVI as a proxy) within a combined spatio-temporal window, sequentially moved over the study area and along the temporal axis of a time series. The trend in the slope values derived from such a sequential linear regression, termed SeRGS, thus represents a measure of change in the VRR. Scenarios of land degradation, defined here as a reduction in biological productivity, which may be caused by either climatic or anthropogenic factors are simulated for the period 1970-2016 from CRU rainfall and modelled NDVI data to test and evaluate the performance of the SeRGS method in detecting degradation, and compare it against the well-known RESTREND method. We found that SeRGS showed (1) overall more pronounced trends and higher significance levels (p <= 0.01) in detecting degradation events and (2) an improved statistical basis for the calculation of trends in the VRR (expressed by high coefficients of determination throughout the period of analysis), which was found to increase the validity of the results produced. Through the implementation of the temporal moving window the effect of inter-annual rainfall variability on vegetation productivity was effectively reduced, thereby enabling a more exact and reliable identification of the timing of degradation events (e.g. start, maximum and end of degradation) by using a time series breakpoint analysis (BFAST). Finally, the SeRGS method was applied using real data for Senegal (seasonally integrated MODIS NDVI and CHIRPS rainfall data 2000-2016) and we discuss patterns and trends. This study provides the theoretical basis for an improved assessment of changes in dryland ecosystem functioning, which is of relevance to land degradation monitoring targeting loss of vegetation productivity.

J	Karamchedu, A				Karamchedu, Ambarish			Creating the 'Rice Bowl of India': Examining the political economy of groundwater-led agrarian transformation in dryland India	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING E-NATURE AND SPACE												This article explores the political economy of groundwater-led agrarian transformation in dryland India through the expansion of groundwater irrigation and rice production since the 1990s. Within this process, I speak to aspirations by subsistence farmers and imaginaries by state governments for agricultural commercialisation via expanding and investing in irrigation infrastructures. In India, this has largely been driven by private and decentralised investments by smallholder farmers. Theoretically adding to the literature on water infrastructures, development aspirations and groundwater governance, I find how farmer aspirations of rice cultivation and associations of the crop with food security and status drove the debt-laden and capital-intensive rapid adoption of groundwater irrigation in dryland Telangana, aided by specific discourses and electricity subsidies policies post the formation of the newest state in India in 2014. I find that political discourses of historical inequalities over water in the struggle for state formation of Telangana in 2014 mobilised electricity subsidies as a key lever to re-imagine the state as a rice bowl of India through groundwater expansion, producing uneven political economy and ecological repercussions for farmers. This article finds that while rice production increased in a short period in Telangana, it came at the expense of widespread well failures and indebtedness at the farmer and village level colliding with the fragile semi-arid climate and hard rock aquifer setting in the state, deepening distress and decay from depleted water infrastructures and failed aspirations.																			2514-8486	2514-8494				2023 NOV 29	2023										10.1177/25148486231217141	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/25148486231217141		NOV 2023											WOS:001111084500001

Restoring the ecological integrity of a dryland river: Why low flows in the Barwon-Darling River must<i>flow</i>	ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT & RESTORATION												For dryland rivers globally, understanding hydro-ecological function is fundamental to informing trade-offs between consumptive water use and aquatic ecosystem integrity. The Barwon-Darling is an Australian dryland river system recognised for its hydrological variability, which is considered a primary driver of the riverine ecosystem. Emphasis has been placed on extremes of zero flow and flood but examining low flow hydrology and hydraulics - through historical and modern droughts - demonstrates that under natural conditions, the river system also exhibits persistent and predictable flow characteristics. From 1885 to 1950, prior to flow regulation, the Barwon-Darling flowed 92% of the time, and throughout severe droughts (1895-1903 and 1939-1945) the river system was characterised by: near-perennial flows (85% of the time), with lotic (flowing water) habitats; and near-annual, in channel, flow pulses. Furthermore, evidence of lotic biota is found consistently in Aboriginal middens dating over the past 15,000 years, thus indicating the long-term persistence of lotic conditions. We propose these consistent hydrological and hydrodynamic features have shaped the ecology of aquatic biota in the Barwon-Darling River but are now experiencing unprecedented change. Flow storage and diversion have increased the frequency and duration of zero flows in some reaches, but arguably the most substantial impacts, along the entire river, are on: (i) low flows, which are now frequently below lotic thresholds, and (ii) the magnitude of near-annual flow pulses, which are reduced by over 90%. Consequently, in modern droughts, the river becomes predominantly lentic (still-water), an impact that is exacerbated by weirpools which create artificial lentic conditions for approximately 1000 km (40%) of river. The ecological impacts of these changes are increasingly apparent, with the loss of lotic biota and a reduction in biodiversity. An ecohydraulic perspective explains present impacts, provides new directions and some immediate solutions for river management, and clarifies choices for stakeholders.

Anny			Dryland soil mycobiome response to long-term precipitation variability depends on host type	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Climate change is projected to cause shifts in precipitation regimes globally, leading to intensified periods of precipitation and droughts. Most studies that have explored the influence of changing precipitation regimes on ecosystems have focused on changes in mean annual precipitation, rather than the variance around the mean. Soil fungi are ubiquitous organisms that drive ecosystem processes, but it is unknown how they respond to long-term increased interannual precipitation variability. Here, we investigated the influence of long-term increased precipitation variability and host type on soil fungal diversity and community composition in a dryland ecosystem. We collected 300 soil samples from two time points and different host type substrate types at a long-term precipitation variability experiment at the Jornada Long Term Ecological Research site. Next, we used amplicon sequencing to characterize soil fungal communities. Soil fungal alpha diversity and community composition were strongly affected by host type and sampling year, and increased precipitation variability caused a modest, statistically insignificant, decrease in soil fungal evenness. Furthermore, results from our structural equational model showed that the decrease in grass-associated soil fungal richness was likely an indirect result of host decline in response to increased precipitation variability. Synthesis. Our work demonstrates effects of increase in interannual precipitation variability on soil fungi, and that plant hosts play a key role in mediating soil fungal responses.

This study investigated the soil properties and groundwater resources of the Hailiutu pasture in Inner Mongolia, China. Soil water characteristics and hydraulic conductivity function curves of the pasture soil were measured based on filter paper method. Experimental results showed that air-entry and residual value were determined to be 34.6% and 13.1%, corresponding to the field water capacity and permanent wilting coefficient, respectively, and the available water capacity was 218.0 mm. The downward velocity of the soil wetting front in the silt is 3.0 mm/h. Site investigation revealed that the pasture was a natural capillary barrier, and its critical suction could optimize the upper boundary of irrigation. Considering the limited underground water resources, shallow water level, and the transpiration of Caragana Korshinskii in the pasture, an available drip irrigation method was designed. The spacing between drip irrigation pipes is 60 cm, the spacing between drip holes is 60 cm, the drip irrigation volume per hole is 475.2 similar to 838.8 mL/d, the drip irrigation time is 110 similar to 200 min at each night. Each hectare pasture exhausts 13.5 similar to 22.5 m(3) water each day. Field tests showed that the proposed method is feasible and can be used for irrigation in dryland pastures.

J	Liu, Y; Zheng, YJ; Li, WP; Zhou, TT				Liu, Yi; Zheng, Yuejun; Li, Wenpeng; Zhou, Tiantian			Estimating evapotranspiration within a dryland watershed: Comparison of eddy-covariance observations, water budget estimates, and satellite-based products	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Accurate and continuous estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) are crucial for comprehending associated hydrological processes, especially in dryland watersheds. However, there remains a scarcity of comprehensive evaluations of multi-source ET estimates' performance and uncertainties. To further assist ET estimation improvement and water resources management, we incorporated diffuse radiation partitioning and water-carbon coupling processes into the satellite-driven Vegetation Interface Processes (VIP) model for estimating ET in the Heihe River Basin, Northwest China, and compared it with eddy covariance (EC) observations, water budget estimates, and five global satellite-based products from Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS), MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Penman-Monteith-Leuning (PML), Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop), and Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS). Sobol' sensitivity analysis was applied to the VIP model. Uncertainties in ET estimates were identified by the three-cornered hat method. Results indicate that stomatal conductance coefficient, quantum efficiency, and clear sky index were dominant influencing parameters for VIP ET. Moreover, VIP and GLASS ET were in strong agreement with the EC-based ET, although SSEBop ET was not, and MODIS ET could not capture seasonal variations. VIP could best represent ET dynamics from water budgets on the basin scale, followed by PML. During the period 2003-2015, GLASS, PML, and VIP provided reasonable ET estimates in this region, with an annual ET of 159.3, 153.2, and 173.5 mm, respectively, across the basin. Furthermore, ET algorithm benefits were presented: BESS and VIP, including diffuse radiation partitioning, performed better in cropland; PML and VIP that address water-carbon coupling were stable and independent of the aridity index, and GLASS could considerably reduce uncertainty. The findings contribute to the collective knowledge of ET estimates in similar dryland areas and are relevant worldwide.

Ammonia (NH3) volatilization is one of the main factors of agricultural non-point source pollution. Slow-release nitrogen fertilizer (S) has been widely recognized as an efficient management measure to increase crop yields and mitigate NH3 volatilization. However, few studies have reported the effects of urea (U) blended with slow-release nitrogen fertilizer (UNS) on maize yield and NH3 volatilization under dryland farming conditions. A two-season field experiment with U, S and various blending ratios of U and S (UNS) under two N application rates (N1: 180 kg N ha(-1) , N2: 240 kg N ha(-1)) was conducted to determine their effects on maize yield, NH3 volatilization and residual soil NO3--N. The results showed that UNS substantially reduced NH3 volatilization compared with U, primarily because of the relatively low soil pH and electrical conductivity, and the relatively high soil organic matter. UNS significantly increased dry matter, grain yield, N uptake and N use efficiency (NUE), but reduced residual soil NO3--N compared with U and S. Among UNS treatments, the blending ratio of U and Sat 3:7 (UNS2) was most effective in improving maize yield and NUE, while mitigating NH3 volatilization and soil NO3--N leaching. N1 not only reduced N losses, but also increased NUE compared with N2. In conclusion, UNS2N1 is recommended as the best N fertilizer application strategy for the sustainable production of dryland maize in northwest China. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study explores the relative importance of Sustainable Livelihoods Framework components in explaining variation in the adaptive capacity of agricultural households in three districts in the drylands of south Punjab, Pakistan, and to identify spatial patterns in adaptive capacity distribution. Questionnaire generated data were analyzed using Non-Linear Principal Component Analysis and spatial cluster mapping using the Global Moran's I and Anselin Local Moran's I. Natural assets were found to describe most variation among households, followed by physical, financial, human and social assets. Most households with high adaptive capacity were spatially clustered in Rahim Yar Khan, a district offering more employment opportunities and multiple income sources. Low adaptive capacity clusters were abundant in Rajanpur where respondents had negative loadings on all the principal components. Bahawalpur district lacked any significant adaptive capacity clusters. Spatial analyses can serve as a useful tool for policy makers in identifying the areas requiring government intervention to enhance adaptive capacity. The approach used here could usefully be applied to dryland regions in other parts of the world, and could help guide more targeted efforts to build adaptive capacity.

However, the current understanding of the nutrient cycling characteristics of the "leave-root-litter-soil" continuum of dryland plantation ecosystems is limited. Therefore, in the Longzhong Loess Plateau of China, we selected nine typical dryland plantations to carry related research, including two evergreen (Platycladus orientalis (13-years and 50-years) and Pinus tabuliformis) and four deciduous (Caragana korshinskii (13-years, 35-years and 55-years), Armeniaca sibirica, Populus hopeiensis and Tamarix chinensis) tree species, and measured C, N, P and K contents of green leaves, fine roots, leaf litter and surface soil (0-20 cm). Results showed tree species and afforestation years strongly changed C, N, P and K contents and ratios of green leaves, fine roots, leaf litter and soil components, and also significantly affected leaf N, P and K reabsorption efficiencies. The average N, P and K contents of four components and soil available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium (AK) contents in deciduous plantations were higher than those in evergreen plantations, resulting in the lower C:N:P:K stoichiometry of deciduous plantations than evergreen plantations. Especially in 55-years C. korshinskii plantation, its soil C, N, AN, AP and AK contents were higher than those in A. sibirica, P. hopeiensis, P. orientalis and P. tabuliformis plantations. Moreover, soil C, N, P, AN, AP and AK contents in C. korshinskii plantations increased significantly with the increase of afforestation years. Thus, C. korshinskii was more suitable for ecological restoration in drylands. Due to the P limitation in plantations, P reabsorption efficiency was higher than N reabsorption efficiency, and significantly negatively correlated with P contents of four components. And green leaves had the homeostasis to soil AP, which may be the nutrient utilization strategies for plantations to alleviate P limitation. Correlation analysis revealed that the C cycling appeared in green leave-fine root and green leave-leaf litter, the N cycling appeared in green leave-leaf litter-soil-fine root, and the P cycling and K cycling appeared in green leave-leaf litter-soil and leaf litter-fine root. These results will provide guidance for ecological restoration and plantation management in drylands.

Water sources including groundwater and streamflow are vital to the growth of deep-rooted legumes in drylands, but it is unclear how their different availability and biochemical properties may influence plant N fixation. We established two sampling transects at the southern fringe of the Taklimakan Desert (Xinjiang province, north-west China) to study the effects of both the groundwater depth and distance to a seasonally active river on the N fixation rate of Alhagi sparsifolia, a dominant deep-rooted legume species. We quantified the N fixation rate of A. sparsifolia using the 15N natural abundance method, and related variation in N fixation to water source use and soil biochemical properties along the two transects. The N fixation rate of A. sparsifolia decreased with groundwater depth and increased with distance from the river channel. Instead of variation in the water source or nutrient concentrations, we found that the gradient in salinity formed by groundwater flow and streamflow was most responsible for the spatial pattern in N fixation of A. sparsifolia. In many dryland regions, water availability controls the spatial variability of symbiotic N fixation along hydrological gradients. Our study system provides a contrasting condition where salinity most strongly regulates N fixation. In addition to understanding the important role of variation in water source and nutrient availability, our study suggests that the impact of soil salinity in mediating N fixation in dryland ecosystems is deserving of attention.						ahmed, zeeshan/0000-0002-7529-3341													0016-7061	1872-6259				JUN	2023	434								116490	10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116490	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116490		MAY 2023											WOS:000993027600001

Net return and risk analysis of winter cover crops in dryland cotton systems	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Winter cover crop and no-till are two promising conservation practices to reduce soil erosion and promote long-term sustainability. This research evaluates the net returns of two different tillage methods and five cover crop treatments in dryland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production and identifies risk-efficient tillage and cover crop management practices. Four-year field experiments (2013-2016) were conducted for a continuous cotton production system under conventional tillage and no-till without a cover crop, as well as no-till with cover crops including winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.), Austrian winter field pea (Pisum sativum L.), hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), and mixed cover crops. Results showed no statistical differences in lint yields (P = .98) or net returns (P = .82). No-till with crimson clover decreased yield variation compared to conventional tillage, while hairy vetch and mixed cover crops increased yield variation. The average net returns were US$454 and $461 ha(-1) for conventional tillage and no-till without a cover crop, respectively. The average net returns ranged from $346 to $389 ha(-1) for the cover crop treatments. Producers have a higher probability of getting a higher net return if switching from conventional tillage to no-till. The risk analysis results showed that no-till without a cover crop was the most preferred practice by risk-neutral, somewhat and rather risk-averse producers. For very and extremely risk-averse producers, no-till with crimson clover was the most preferred management practice.

However, most previous studies focused on single soil depth, leading to a poor understanding of SOC in multiple depths. To better understand the spatial distribution pattern of SOC in Northeast and North China Plain, we compared three machine learning algorithms (i.e., Cubist, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF)) within the digital soil mapping framework. A total of 386 sampling sites (1584 samples) following specific criteria covering all dryland districts and counties and soil types in four depths (i.e., 0-10, 10-20, 20-30 and 30-40 cm) were collected in 2017. After feature selection from 249 environmental covariates by the Genetic Algorithm, 29 variables were used to fit models. The results showed SOC increased from southern to northern regions in the spatial scale and decreased with soil depths. From the result of independent verification (validation dataset: 80 sampling sites), RF (R-2: 0.58, 0.71, 0.73, 0.74 and RMSE: 3.49, 3.49, 2.95, 2.80 g kg(-1) in four depths) performed better than Cubist (R-2: 0.46, 0.63, 0.67, 0.71 and RMSE: 3.83, 3.60, 3.03, 2.72 g kg(-1)) and XGBoost (R-2: 0.53, 0.67, 0.70, 0.71 and RMSE: 3.60, 3.60, 3.00, 2.83 g kg(-1)) in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness. Soil, parent material and organism were the most important covariates in SOC prediction. This study provides the up-to-date spatial distribution of dryland SOC in Northeast and North China Plain, which is of great value for evaluating dynamics of soil quality after long-term cultivation.					jie, xue/HLP-6332-2023; Chen, Songchao/S-7982-2019; shi, Zhou/A-2283-2015	jie, xue/0000-0002-0340-5594; Chen, Songchao/0000-0003-1245-0482; shi, Zhou/0000-0003-3914-5402; Zhang, Xianglin/0000-0003-0792-4700; Huang, Yuanfang/0000-0002-6706-0361														2072-4292				MAY	2022	14	10							2504	10.3390/rs14102504	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14102504													WOS:000801335800001

Dryland Grain Sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>) Yield and Yield Component Responses to Tillage and Mulch Practices Under Subtropical African Conditions	AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												In the African subtropical zones, the choice of tillage practice is critical to sustainable rainfed crop production. Two season (2015 and 2016) field trials were conducted at Matopos Research Institute (20 degrees 24 ' S; 28 degrees 29 ' E, 1340 m above sea level) in southern Zimbabwe in order to determine dryland grain sorghum yield and 1000 kernel weight responses to tillage and mulch practices under African subtropical conditions. Sorghum grain yield was highest in planting basin tillage plots under 4 T ha(-1)sorghum stover mulch application (3140.9 kg ha(-1)for year 2015 and 3415.7 kg ha(-1)for year 2016). The 1000 kernel weights in both years were least in ripper tillage and greatest in planting basin tillage field trial plots. The mass of 1000 sorghum kernels on planting basin tillage subplots under 2 T ha(-1)sorghum stover mulching was 8.6 g (25.1%) and 8.4 g (24.2%) in excess of that recorded on mulched ripper subplots for 2015 season. For the season 2016, mass of 1000 sorghum kernels on planting basin tillage subplots under 4 T ha(-1)sorghum stover mulching was 9.1 g (22.9%) and 8.4 g (21.1%) in excess of that recorded on mulched ripper subplots. The adoption of the planting basin tillage under sorghum stover mulching, a technology designed for smallholder farmers with limited access to animal draft power, can improve considerably the dryland sorghum grain yield and weight of 1000 kernels.

This study quantified the effects of tillage and straw management on SOC concentrations and stocks and P fractions after 40 years of dryland wheat under a semi-arid temperate climate. The treatments were straw management (burned and not burned) combined with tillage methods (conventional tillage (CT), stubble mulch (SM), and no-tillage (NT)). Fertilizer nitrogen (N) and P were applied annually at 60 and 12.5 kg ha(-1), respectively. The soils were sampled from 0-50, 50-200, 200-400, 400-600, 600-800, and 800-1000 mm depths, and analyzed using standard methods. The concentration of SOC was not affected by tillage and straw management, except in 200-400 mm where it was higher where the straw was burned rather than retained. The total C stock (0-1000 mm) was higher under NT with straw burning, CT with no burning, and SM, than NT with straw retention and CT with burning. In the topsoil, NT had significantly (p < 0.05) higher Bray 1 P, NaOH II Pi, and residual P than SM and CT, while burning straw increased Bray 1 P and NaHCO3 Pi concentrations. The findings imply that while the SOC concentration is not significantly affected by tillage, but is increased by burning in the subsoil only, the total C stock is improved by NT with burned straw, CT with straw retention, and SM, while the labile P fractions are increased by NT with burned straw, relative to CT with burned straw, in the semi-arid dryland wheat region.

In the first experiment, under split plot design a summer fallow treatment was compared with four different cover crops including mung bean (Phaseolus radiatus L.), huai bean (Glycine ussuriensis Regel et Maack), hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), and rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) under varying cover cropping patterns (crop rotation and crop relay intercropping). The second experiment was conducted with RCDB design to investigate four different cover crops (Huai bean, mung bean, hairy vetch and rapeseed) and four planting densities (75, 100, 125 and 150% of the recommended planting density). The results revealed that mung bean, huai bean and hairy vetch at 150% of planting density produced the highest biomass, while the rapeseed at 75% planting densities yielded higher biomass compared to the local recommended rate. Moreover, huai bean and rapeseed rotation resulted in higher contents of soil organic matter, total and mineral N, available P and K contents in comparison to the fallow treatment. Thus, Huai bean and rapeseed wheat rotations are effective strategies in order to improve crops productivity and soil quality in the Loess Plateau of China.																			0552-9034	2076-0906				JUN	2020	57	3					921	931		10.21162/PAKJAS/20.10006	http://dx.doi.org/10.21162/PAKJAS/20.10006													WOS:000546678300038

However, it remains unclear about the effects of long term fertilization on C and N immobilization as well as C/N ratios in soil aggregates at different depths. Samples taken at depths of 0 to 40 cm from dryland red soil subjected to long-term fertilization were analyzed. Four treatments were involved in the long term fertilization including no fertilizer (control), chemical fertilizer applied at two different rates, and manure combined with chemical fertilizers (MNPK). The C and N concentrations in the soil aggregates of different sizes were significantly higher (P < 0.05) and the C/N ratios in the particulate organic matter were significantly lower (P < 0.05) for soil to 20 cm deep for the MNPK treatment than for the other treatments. ANOVA indicated that the C and N concentration and C/N ratios in different sizes of aggregates significantly varied with soil depth (P < 0.05). Microaggregates contained most of the C and N, and the C/N ratios for silt-clay particles in macroaggregates were 1.37 unit (ranging - 0.25 to 2.44) lower than for other soil particles with diameters < 53 mu m. The C and N contents in aggregates of different sizes increased as the C input rate increased to a depth of 40 cm because of the fertilization practices. Overall, both increased C input and deep application of C sources promoted the storage of C and N in microaggregates, which in turn increased C and N sequestration in dryland red soils.

However, the effect of leguminous plants on microbial synthesized SOC accumulation remains a knowledge gap. We investigated the effects of planting shrubs (leguminous Caragana korshinskii and non leguminous Salix psammophila) in abandoned croplands on microbial substance accumulation in soil compared with natural succession (dominated by non leguminous semi-shrub Artemisia desertorum) in an arid area. Seventeen years after plantation, C. korshinskii increased SOC stock in the top 20 cm across canopy and gap areas by 34-80%, but S. psammophila did not affect SOC compared with abandonment (A. desertorum). This variation in the SOC stock across three vegetation types was not consistent with change patterns of aboveground litter accumulation and root biomass, but was consistent with higher living microbial biomass and non living microbial necromass contents in the soil and their proportions in the SOC under leguminous C. korshinskii than non leguminous A. desertorum and S. psammophila. These results indicated that the increased SOC under the leguminous relative to non leguminous species was mainly ascribed to the increased accumulation of microbial synthesized substances under the legume. Microbial necromass N represented 56-59% of total soil N under C. korshinskii, but this proportion was only 25-39% under non leguminous species, responding to much greater plant N input and soil N availability under the legume. Therefore, we suggest that symbiotic N fixation by leguminous species increased the production of microbial biomass and potentially decreased the reuse of N from microbial necromass compared with non leguminous species. As such, legumes can efficiently increase the net accumulation of microbial necromass carbon and thus the SOC content in dryland soils.

Mechanised sowing and weeding were based on using a combined donkey-drawn planter/weeder and a motorised planter/weeder. The research methods included studies of seed delivery in manual and mechanised sowing, field experiments on different levels of mechanization/intensification, labour studies on mechanisation and an economic assessment of the different levels of intensification. The average sorghum grain yield across three years increased by 352 kg ha(-1) (43.7% increase) by combining mechanisation with seed priming and microdosing of 0.2 g NPK 15-15-15 fertiliser per pocket compared to a control with manual sowing but without seed priming and microdosing. The labour demand (sowing and weeding) for manual, donkey-drawn and motorised operations was 184, 67 and 47 hours ha(-1), respectively. An economic analysis showed that the donkey-drawn planter/weeder is the appropriate mechanisation below six ha while above this land size it becomes increasingly interesting for the farmers to invest in a motorised planter. The use of mechanisation will result in earlier and uniform crop establishment, facilitate microdosing application, timelier weeding, higher yields, better economic return and reduced labour demand.

However, its main effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) or total organic carbon, TOC (SOC and coal-C) contents as well as their effects on soil physico-chemical properties are still unclear. Two types of organic wastes (maize straw and manure) were utilized in dryland affected by mining activities to quantify their relative effect on soil physico-chemical properties. Regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between the soil physical properties, SOC, and TOC as well as their respective contributions to improving these properties. Treatments included control (CK), straw (S), low manure (LM), medium manure plus straw (S-MM), and high manure plus straw (S-HM). The results showed that SOC, soil bulk density, mean weight diameter (MWD), soil total porosity, soil penetration resistance, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and soil infiltration rate were strongly influenced by the application of organic wastes. A stronger linear relationship between SOC and the MWD, (R-2 = 0.93, p < 0.05) compared to that between TOC and MWD indicated the important role of SOC in improving soil aggregation relative to the effect of TOC. According to the principal component analysis (PCA), the application of organic wastes had stronger effects on SOC contents and physical properties than TOC (SOC and coal-C). These findings advance our understanding of the actual effect of organic wastes on soil physical properties and SOC in dryland affected by mining activities and could inform fertilizer management decisions to improve soil properties.

In this experiment, 49 accessions were sown with a check variety in an augmented design in Whitlow farm 2015, central ferry farm 2016 and Spillman farm 2016, Washington state university. The three different locations were in the dryland of southeastern Washington. The collected 49 accessions were screened, where 32 accession were taken from the United States Department of Agriculture's single plant-derived core collection and 16 from lentil reference population of ICARDA and one check variety was Avondale. Secondary traits such as green Normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), red Normalized difference vegetation index (RNDVI), photochemical reflectance index (PRI), red Normalized difference vegetation index (RNDVI), water band index (WBI), and normalized water index (NWI) were collected using a multi spectral reflectance device and agronomic metrics such as days to flowering (DF), biomass yield per plant (BYP) and seed yield per plant (SYP) data were also collected as well. Multi trait genotype ideotype distance (MGIDI) addresses the restrictions of AMMI and GGE analysis by using BLUP and ideotype distance, which can properly select genotypes considering higher yields as well as consider other desirable parameters GNDVI, RNDVI, PRI, WBI, NWI. The accessions Avondale, PI 368647, ILL7090, PI33690, PI 5187, ILL 86, ILL595, PI 533690, PI 518734, ILL 1649, ILL 4781 were selected as the ten best genotypes and Avondale, ILL7090, PI533690 were less affected by G x E interaction and selected for further evaluation based on AMMI, GGE and MGIDI index.

Two-year field experiments were conducted to evaluate the influence of N rates (0, 100 and 200 kg ha(-1)) and genotype (hybrids vs. open pollinated variety) on N uptake, distribution, remobilization and use, and to quantify the relative contribution of different plant organs as N-providers to seed in dryland Mediterranean safflower. The rate of 100 kg N ha(-1) was adequate to maximize N content at anthesis and N use efficiency. Early N uptake was a key physiological process that largely determined the N dynamics during the achene-filling period. Enhanced N content at anthesis improved N remobilization from vegetative parts to achenes, with capitulum vegetative components (including bracts) contributing to N remobilization, on average, more (69%) than leaf plus stems (31%). The N remobilization efficiency ranged between 56 and 63%. High early N accumulation (> 158 kg N ha(-1)) and low sink N (< 113 kg N ha(-1)) resulted in N losses from plants during the post-anthesis period. Nitrogen application had no influence on the N harvest index or the efficiency of biomass production. Selection for improved N utilization efficiency would theoretically penalize achene protein content due to the negative correlation between these parameters. Safflower produced up to 32 kg achene yield per unit of N taken up. The inclusion of safflower in the rotation system of winter cereals in semiarid Mediterranean environments, apart from the diversification of cropping systems might keep the overall N utilization efficiency unchanged.

J	Das, BT; Schmidt, S; Harrison, MT; Hunt, I; Biggs, JS; Huth, NI				Das, Bianca Tara; Schmidt, Susanne; Harrison, Matthew Tom; Hunt, Ian; Biggs, Jody Scott; Huth, Neil Ian			Key drivers of phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) in a dryland cropping system	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												Increasing phosphorus (P) fertiliser use efficiency (PUE) is essential for addressing global nutrition security, food production costs, and environmental pollution. However, a myriad of soil x climate x crop x management interactions control PUE and adaptive tools are needed to put this complexity into context at the field scale. We conducted a Morris global sensitivity analysis on an evaluated agricultural system model (APSIM) across 132 years of climate data to identify important drivers of PUE in a subtropical dryland cropping system. We selected soil, crop, and management parameters to understand their influence on yield, biomass, and grain P export as measures of PUE in a subtropical wheat crop. We then examined three P fertility scenarios ranging from low to high (10, 40, 70 mg available P kg(-1) at 0-10 cm, with subsoils to 180 cm at 9-10 mg available P kg(-1)) resulting in 1,782,000 simulations. In scenarios with medium or high P fertility and higher in-crop rainfall (> 200 mm), nitrogen (N) fertiliser was the most important driver for increasing yield and associated PUE. At low P fertility and lower in-crop rainfall (< 200 mm), P fertiliser and P sorption isotherm parameters were the most important drivers. This highlighted potential constraints to PUE analysis in the region if rainfall data is not available, and to modelling activities if P isotherm data is not available. Our study is the first to use a Morris global sensitivity analysis method for defining the influence of N and P fertiliser, and in-crop rainfall, as short-term (year-year) drivers of PUE. This method may be adapted to investigate emerging challenges in increasing PUE in other agricultural systems, but future research should include interactions with deep P banding, the effects of climate change, and demonstrate drivers over the longer-term (5-10 years).																			1774-0746	1773-0155				DEC	2023	43	6							76	10.1007/s13593-023-00929-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-023-00929-1													WOS:001103780900001

Topography is considered to play an important role in the distribution of soil moisture, which will significantly affect grassland ecosystems. To examine the response of soil water content (SWC) and aboveground biomass (AGB) of grassland vegetation to precipitation patterns and topography, a 6-year investigation was conducted during the period from 2012 to 2017 in a semiarid steppe of Inner Mongolia, China. The study area was divided into three parts based on the landscape position, i.e., top area (TA), slope area (SA) and bottom area (BA). The results suggested that SWC and AGB would be significantly affected by topography and precipitation patterns. A significant negative relationship was found between the SWC and the altitude of the sampling sites. In the dryer years (2013-2017), the AGB of the BA was significantly higher than that of the SA and TA. However, a non-significant difference was found for the AGB values between the three landscape positions in the wetter year (2012). During the growing season, variation of AGB and SWC was similar in 2014 but differed in 2015. AGB exhibited a significant positive relationship with SWC above a minimum value. Precipitation significantly affected the AGB of grassland, and moderate rainfall events were more effective than light rainfall events for grassland vegetation. Moreover, the distribution of species varied in different areas, which may result in the differences in the responses of AGB to soil moisture and precipitation. This study clarifies the effects of micro-topography on soil moisture and grassland ecosystems at a local scale in dryland regions, which provides useful information for grassland ecosystem management.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2019	105						107	115		10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.05.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.05.002													WOS:000490574200011

Modelling the ecological impact of invasive weed <i>Verbesina encelioides</i> on vegetation composition across dryland ecosystems of Punjab, northwestern India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Events of climate change have led to increased aridification, which alters local vegetation patterns and results in the invasion of opportunistic species. Though many studies assess the impact of invasive weeds and aridification at the agronomic level, studies investigating changes in local vegetation are severely lacking. We investigated the impact of the invasive plant Verbesina encelioides (Asteraceae) on the local vegetation composition across different dryland ecosystems in Punjab, northwestern India. Based on the aridity index for the period of 1991-2016, three major dryland ecosystems, i.e., arid, semi-arid, and sub-humid, were found in Punjab. The impact of V. encelioides on local biodiversity was measured in terms of species diversity (using Shannon's diversity index, Simpson's dominance index, Hill's evenness index, and Margalef's richness index), species composition (using non-metric multidimensional scaling based on Bray-Curtis's dissimilarity index), and species proportion in the two invasion classes (uninvaded and invaded) and across the three aridity zones (arid, semi-arid, and sub-humid). The vegetation survey depicted the presence of 53 flowering species belonging to 22 families, including 30 exotics and 23 natives. Verbesina encelioides decreased species diversity and proportion, with a more pronounced impact in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. In contrast, species composition varied between uninvaded and invaded classes only in arid ecosystems. Ecological parameters derived from population statistics (number of individuals) were more drastically affected than those from species abundance data. Since the ecological impacts of V. encelioides were manifested with increased aridification, it is a matter of apprehension under the potential climate change scenario.

F.; Rossini, Micol			UAV RGB, thermal infrared and multispectral imagery used to investigate the control of terrain on the spatial distribution of dryland biocrust	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Biocrusts (topsoil communities formed by mosses, lichens, bacteria, fungi, algae, and cyanobacteria) are a key biotic component of dryland ecosystems. Whilst climate patterns control the distribution of biocrusts in drylands worldwide, terrain and soil attributes can influence biocrust distribution at landscape scale. Multi-source unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery was used to map and study biocrust ecology in a typical dryland ecosystem in central Spain. Red, green and blue (RGB) imagery was processed using structure-from-motion techniques to map terrain attributes related to microclimate and terrain stability. Multispectral imagery was used to produce accurate maps (accuracy > 80%) of dryland ecosystem components (vegetation, bare soil and biocrust composition). Finally, thermal infrared (TIR) and multispectral imagery was used to calculate the apparent thermal inertia (ATI) of soil and to evaluate how ATI was related to soil moisture (r(2) = 0.83). The relationship between soil properties and UAV-derived variables was first evaluated at the field plot level. Then, the maps obtained were used to explore the relationship between biocrusts and terrain attributes at ecosystem level through a redundancy analysis. The most significant variables that explain biocrust distribution are: ATI (34.4% of variance, F = 130.75; p < 0.001), Elevation (25.8%, F = 97.6; p < 0.001), and potential solar incoming radiation (PSIR) (52.9%, F = 200.1; p < 0.001). Differences were found between areas dominated by lichens and mosses. Lichen-dominated biocrusts were associated with areas with high slopes and low values of ATI, with soil characterized by a higher amount of soluble salts, and lower amount of organic carbon, total phosphorus (P-tot) and total nitrogen (N-tot). Biocrust-forming mosses dominated lower and moister areas, characterized by gentler slopes and higher values of ATI with soils with higher contents of organic carbon, P-tot and N-tot. This study shows the potential to use UAVs to improve our understanding of drylands and to evaluate the control that the terrain has on biocrust distribution.

J	Fu, TL; Li, XR				Fu, Tonglin; Li, Xinrong			Estimating the monthly pan evaporation with limited climatic data in dryland based on the extended long short-term memory model enhanced with meta-heuristic algorithms	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Accurate estimation of evaporation is of great significance for understanding regional drought, and managing and applying limited water resources in dryland. However, the application of the traditional estimation approaches is limited due to the lack of required meteorological parameters or experimental conditions. In this study, a novel hybrid model was proposed to estimate the monthly pan Ep in dryland by integrating long short-term memory (LSTM) with grey wolf optimizer (GWO) algorithm and Kendall-tau correlation coefficient, where the GWO algorithm was employed to find the optimal hyper-parameters of LSTM, and Kendall-tau correlation coefficient was used to determine the input combination of meteorological variables. The model performance was compared to the performance of other methods based on the evaluation metrics, including root mean squared error (RMSE), the normalized mean squared error (NMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSCE). The results indicated that the optimal input meteorological parameters of the hybrid Kendall-tau-GWO-LSTM models are the monthly average temperature, the minimum air temperature, the maximum air temperature, the minimum values of RMSE, NMSE, MAE, and MAPE are 38.28, 0.20, 26.62, and 19.96%, and the maximum NSCE is 0.89, suggesting that the hybrid Kendall-tau-GWO-LSTM exhibit better model performance than the other hybrid models. Thus, the hybrid Kendall-tau-GWO-LSTM model was highly recommended for estimating pan Ep with limited meteorological information in dryland. The present investigation provides a novel method to estimate the monthly pan Ep with limited meteorological variables in dryland by coupling a deep learning model with meta-heuristic algorithms and the data preprocessing techniques.																			2045-2322					APR 12	2023	13	1							5960	10.1038/s41598-023-32838-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32838-4								37045898					WOS:001034742000046
J	Pavey, CR; Nano, CEM; Waltert, M				Pavey, Chris R.; Nano, Catherine E. M.; Waltert, Matthias			Population dynamics of dasyurid marsupials in dryland Australia: Variation across habitat and time	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												The irruptive population dynamics of rodents are a globally renowned wildlife phenomenon; however, the dynamics of other small mammals with which rodents are sympatric are poorly understood. Dryland Australia supports a high diversity of small (<200 g) arthropod-eating marsupials (Dasyuridae). Here, we test the hypothesis that dasyurid marsupials do not exhibit the same degree of irruptive population dynamics that are shown by rodents. We addressed this question by sampling small mammal assemblages on 20 permanent trapping sites in the Simpson Desert on 20 occasions from 2007 to 2017. Sampling was stratified across three broad habitat types: sandridge, gibber plain and clay plain. We captured 478 dasyurid marsupials of nine species, ranging in mean body mass from 5.75 to 93.50 g, at a capture rate of 1.71 per 100 trap-nights. Capture rate varied across habitat and over time and the interaction between these two effects was also significant. Capture rate was highest on clay plain (3.35 captures/100 trap-nights), followed by gibber plain (2.16 captures/100 trap-nights) and lowest on sand habitat (0.54 captures/100 trap-nights). Each species had a clear preference for one of the dominant habitat types. Dasyurid assemblages responded to high rainfall pulses in November-December 2008 and January 2015; however, the largest rainfall period in 2010-2011 resulted in very low captures. Likewise, a peak in abundance occurred in April 2008 although it was not preceded by high rainfall. We conclude that, although dasyurid marsupial capture rates varied up to 34 fold during the study period, population changes are not strongly tied to rainfall. Heterothermic physiology in this family, in particular the ability to use daily torpor to save energy, may be central to the decoupling of population dynamics from rainfall-driven primary productivity.

Lucerne establishment in dryland conditions: effects of crop residues and wheat as a nurse crop	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE												Establishing lucerne (Medicago sativa) in dryland conditions poses challenges due to unpredictable rainy seasons and seedling vulnerability. A potential solution is adopting a nurse crop during the first year in the same field. This study aimed to assess the impact of wheat as a nurse crop and crop residue on lucerne establishment in South Africa's Mediterranean climate region. The experiment employed a split-plot design with two treatment factors across six blocks. Half of the area received wheat straw, while the rest had low residue content with almost bare soil. The nurse crop combinations included wheat alone, lucerne alone, and a wheat-lucerne mixture. Results revealed competition between wheat and lucerne when planted together. When plant populations, total biomass, wheat grain yield and grain quality were considered, wheat performed better in pure stands, as did lucerne when grown without wheat. Germination of lucerne was significantly impacted by high crop residue levels. Wheat achieved superior grain yield without crop residue, despite producing less biomass. Results indicated that it is advisable to avoid using a nurse cropping system for lucerne in this Mediterranean climate region.

These crops can help smallholder agriculture to become more resilient, productive, and profitable, but their quantitative impact on carbon sequestration is unknown. The aim of this review study was to quantify their contribution to carbon sequestration across the drylands of Africa and South Asia based on 437 publications with 1319 observations in studies conducted across 32 countries. Cropping systems with grain legumes showed the greatest increase in soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations, while cereals (and pigeon pea) gave the largest amount of aboveground carbon stock (>2 Mg C ha 1). Estimated carbon stock in post-harvest residues of these crops was 1.51 +/- 0.05 Mg C ha 1 in Africa and 2.29 +/- 0.10 Mg C ha 1 in South Asia. These crops produced more aboveground carbon, and significantly increased SOC, when grown as intercrops. Soils with low initial SOC (<1%) and high clay content (>32%) showed the greatest potential for carbon sequestration when cropped with grain legumes and dryland cereals. This study is the first of its kind to provide evidence that grain legumes and drylands cereals improve carbon sequestration across Africa and South Asia.

Phytoplankton in dryland riverine waterholes: environmental drivers, variability and ecosystem-monitoring potential using different levels of taxonomic resolution and dataset reduction	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Waterholes that remain in the dry season in intermittent dryland rivers are important biotic refugia, but detailed ecological descriptions of these habitats and their plankton are scarce. We aimed to determine spatial and temporal variation in phytoplankton assemblages in a tropical Australian dryland river system, their main environmental determinants and the potential of the phytoplankton for ecosystem monitoring. We sampled nine sites in three rivers over 2 years using standard methods. Water quality and phytoplankton assemblages varied considerably among sites, rivers and seasons, reflecting lithology, hydrology, bathymetry and local catchment influences. Major environmental drivers included conductivity, pH, temperature and species of N and P. We analysed several derived versions of the original dataset by using density and presence-absence data, eliminating rarer species and grouping species into higher taxa. We found substantial consistency among analyses in environmental drivers, identified using distance-based linear modelling, and in variability among systems, identified using nested permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). Responsiveness of the algal assemblages to environmental drivers and consistency among analyses, even using subsamples at low taxonomic resolution, suggests potential for ecosystem monitoring and optimising of sample throughput, although variability among systems requires substantial effort to determine the range of reference conditions.

Morphodynamic modelling of dryland non-perennial riverscapes, with implications for environmental water allocation	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT												Reach-scale river restoration or environmental water allocation (EWA) exercises typically address the magnitude and temporal dynamics (frequency, duration, timing, rate of change) of flows required to sustain desirable ecological conditions along a river. The role of geomorphology in this process is to broaden the gaze beyond flows to consider larger and longer-term interactions between valley lithological structure, and the feed and fate of flow-sediment mixtures. This paper proposes the integration of numerical morphodynamic modelling in evaluations of environmental water requirements for non-perennial riverscapes (channel-riparian-floodplain environments). The paper presents a methodological framework, and proof of concept case study from the Touws River, South Africa, for the application of morphodynamic modelling in EWA. The paper illustrates operational approaches to modelling the complexity of dryland mixed bedrock-alluvial (and mixed-load) riverscapes with highly variable non-perennial flow regimes, including an approach to generating initial bed conditions for numerical experiments by 'morphodynamic spin-up', and approaches to synthesising and presenting numerical experiment output in the form of a dynamic range of potential variability in metrics of physical habitat suitability and diversity, and disturbance/renewal regimes. Such efforts can assist in enhancing field observations and testing field-based hypotheses of flow-sediment regime-physical habitat associations, extending the timescales of analysis beyond field observation, and constraining uncertainty about the dynamic range of variability in responses to predicted future flow-sediment regime modifications. Further research is needed to develop growth models appropriate for key non-perennial river vegetation types, to support biomorphodynamic modelling of geomorphology-vegetation interactions, and to determine or predict appropriate inlet sediment concentrations for historical and future modification scenarios.

Therefore, the methods for assessing their status should be easy and repeatable. Monitoring through satellite data and field measurements are limited in accurately assessing the spatiotemporal dynamics of ecosystems. Fortunately, emerging technologies like Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) allow to transcend these limitations. But their calibration with field data for application in rangelands is still relatively new and less common than for example in precision agriculture. In this study we developed a drone-based workflow for mapping the condition of ran-gelands in dryland savannah. We evaluated how accurately and efficiently the two common indicators (i.e., potential forage biomass and rangeland cover type) of rangeland condition can be estimated from drone imagery across a range of conditions (i.e., highly degraded to healthy rangelands). To develop the drone-based potential forage biomass model we tested the accuracy of four vegetation indices to predict field biomass, with the optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) showing the highest prediction accuracy (R-2 = 0.89 and RMSE = 194.05). The OSAVI-based model yielded a significant strong relationship (R-2 = 0.80, p < 0.001) between predicted and field observed potential forage biomass across the rangeland system. For land cover, we applied a decision tree classification based on thresholds determined using data mining, with a mean overall accuracy of 95.8%. The drone-based estimates of bare cover, herbaceous cover and woody cover showed strong agreements (R(2 )ranging between 0.86 and 0.97) with the two image-truthing methods (line-point intercept and visual es-timations) tested. We show that the drone-based approach is more efficient, unbiased, and repeatable than the field methods. Based on these results, the drone-based workflow presented here offers a reproducible, accurate and efficient approach for near-real time monitoring of rangeland condition at a landscape level. This may assist with climate-adapted management to prevent further land degradation and associated threats to biodiversity and human livelihoods.

A two-season field trial was carried out at Save Experiment Station (20 degrees 24'S; 28 degrees 29'E) in Zimbabwe to establish soil water storage, selected biometric parameters of dryland grain sorghum responses to in-field rainwater harvesting tillage methods. Deep basin tillage method significantly increased the soil moisture content by 14.6% (62.5 mm); 6.2 % (26.5 mm) above that on the ridges and in furrows of open and closed end tied ridges, respectively. Soil moisture storage in deep basins, on ridges and in furrows of open and closed end tied ridges exceeded that in conventional tillage plots by 98.0 mm (29.8%); 35.5 mm (10.8%) and 69.5 mm (21.1%), respectively. Consequently, sorghum plant biometric growth parameters in deep basin tillage treatments were significantly higher than those in conventional, open- and close-ended tied ridges tillage plots. However, the use of conservation tillage methods where tied end ridges are opened introduces homogeneous soil water build-ups in furrows and ridges as those observed in tied end ridges with closed ends. As a consequence, biometric growth parameters of sorghum are not altered by substituting open with closed end tied ridges.																			2331-1932					JAN 1	2021	7	1							1925004	10.1080/23311932.2021.1925004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2021.1925004													WOS:000655254000001

Krishna			Root anatomical traits of wild-rices reveal links between flooded rice and dryland sorghum	PLANT PHYSIOLOGY REPORTS												The root anatomical and morphological traits and their plasticity under water deficit are essential to improve adaptation of rice cultivars to water-limited conditions. We investigated wild-rice accessions along with a dryland cereal (Sorghum bicolor) for root related traits under non-stress and water deficit during panicle initiation and flowering. Wild-rices from GG genome (Oryza granulata and Oryza meyeriana) recorded high similarity with sorghum in key root anatomical parameters such as larger stele diameter in proportion to root diameter (SD:RD [%]) and more late metaxylem number (LMXN). Comparative analyses between wild-rice accessions and a diverse indica panel revealed narrow genetic variability in LMXN and SD:RD in Oryza sativa panel compared to O. granulata and O. meyeriana. Wild-rices from GG genome had a combination of favorable anatomy (larger SD:RD and more but smaller late metaxylem) and root morphology (thinner roots and higher root surface area) during panicle initiation and flowering compared to popular rice cultivar IR64. The above combination can help facilitate effective water use by regulating axial water flow under water-deficit conditions, while the opposite was noticed in the drought susceptible IR64. Novel sources for root anatomical traits identified from wild-rice accessions can be utilized in rice breeding programs to develop water-deficit stress tolerant rice cultivars.

In the dryland of northwest China, the high input of nitrogen (N) fertilizer drives high GHG emissions. Replacement of part of the N fertilizer with manure (NM) and adding supplemental irrigation water (NMW) to NM can significantly increase crop yields. However, it is still unknown whether the increased yield would induce more GHG emissions. In this study, the change in GHG emissions were investigated under conventional farmer N application (FN), NM and NMW in winter wheat cropping systems. The two-year study showed that the global warming potential, greenhouse gas intensity and carbon footprint of NM and NMW were 3-25%, 21-42% and 9-18% lower, respectively, than those of FN, owing to the lower N fertilizer and the associated N2O emissions under NM and NMW. In addition, compared with FN, CO2 emissions during the growing season were higher under NM and NMW; however, due to the 23-40% higher biomass productivity, NM and NMW neutralized and fixed more CO2 (21-39% higher net ecosystem productivity) than FN. Therefore, NM and NMW could be favorable agronomic practices in the Loess Plateau when considering the dual goal of maintaining acceptable yields while reducing GHG emissions.					wang, yu/IUQ-6654-2023; Wang, Ying/HJI-2509-2023; Yin, Lina/AAA-9723-2019; 郭, 青霞/GZH-2618-2022; wang, yingying/GRS-3058-2022; Wang, Yiping/IZQ-2052-2023; wang, yan/GSE-6489-2022; Yue, Shanchao/D-1846-2009; wang, ying/GQY-5077-2022	Yue, Shanchao/0000-0001-8724-2974; 													0167-8809	1873-2305				JUL 1	2022	332								107937	10.1016/j.agee.2022.107937	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2022.107937		MAR 2022											WOS:000791946900007

The relationships between soil fertility and microbial communities have been demonstrated with successional stages of biocrusts, however, the effects of soil stability on microbial communities are poorly understood. Thus, we investigated the changes in microbial communities, soil stability and fertility with biocrust succession and sampled soils with biocrusts with increasing moss coverage in a semiarid climate in the Loess Plateau of China. The phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) method was used to determine the structural diversity of the microbial groups. The results showed that soil cohesion (which represented the soil stability) increased by 40%, and that the content of organic matter, total N and available N was 93%, 8% and 1.9 times greater in the later successional moss than in the early successional cyanobacteria. Consequently, the microbial diversity according to the Shannon and Simpson indices increased by 1.80% and 0.44%, respectively, and the microbial biomass was 3.1 times higher in the moss biocrusts than in the cyanobacteria biocrusts in biocrust layer, and the underlying 0-2 cm soil layer showed the similar changes of soil properties and microbial communities with biocrust layer. These findings are important for achieving a better understanding of the functions and services of biocrusts and provide a prediction for ecosystem processes in dryland ecosystems.																			1164-5563	1778-3615				NOV-DEC	2019	95								103120	10.1016/j.ejsobi.2019.103120	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejsobi.2019.103120													WOS:000501652600002

We exploit observations from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R series to examine the effect of a severe U.S. heatwave in 2020 on the diurnal variations of ecosystem photosynthesis. We find divergent responses of photosynthesis to the heatwave across vegetation types and aridity gradients, with drylands exhibiting widespread midday and afternoon depression in photosynthesis. The diurnal centroid and peak time of dryland gross primary production (GPP) substantially shift toward earlier morning times, reflecting notable water and heat stress. Our geostationary satellite-based method outperforms traditional radiation-based upscaling methods from polar-orbiting satellite snapshots in estimating daily GPP and GPP loss during heatwaves. These findings underscore the potential of geostationary satellites for diurnal photosynthesis monitoring and highlight the necessity to consider the increased diurnal asymmetry in GPP under stress when evaluating carbon-climate interactions.

Linking an Emerging Soil Health Paradigm with Shifting Social Fields among Wheat Growers of the High Plains	RURAL SOCIOLOGY												Once reliant on year-long periods of unvegetated fallow, dryland farmers are reaping environmental and economic benefits by replacing fallow with a crop, a practice called cropping system intensification. However, in the U.S. High Plains, transitions to intensified cropping systems have been slow relative to other regions, and cropping systems have stratified into varying degrees of intensity. Prior attempts to explain the wave of cropping system intensification have largely focused on simple economic rationales, and thus we lack a critical understanding of the social dynamics underlying the revolution in semi-arid cropping systems. We examined the motivations, perceptions, and social interactions of dryland farmers that practice different levels of cropping system intensity in Colorado and Nebraska. Building on Carolan's application of Bourdieusian social fields to agriculture, we identify overlapping fields expressed among interviewees. While these fields are reflected in farms' different degrees of intensification, they can be used to help identify and locate farmers associated with the emerging soil health (or regenerative agriculture) movement. The paper concludes by identifying strategies for change, some which would serve to reshape social fields, and others which leverage existing social positions and relationships to enable farmers to overcome the barriers constraining cropping system intensification.

Drylands are paradigmatic examples of systems prone to experiencing abrupt changes in their functioning. Indeed, space-for -time substitution approaches suggest that abrupt changes in plant productivity are wide-spread, but this evidence is less clear using observational time series or experimental data at a large scale. Studying the prevalence and, most importantly, the unknown drivers of abrupt (rather than gradual) dynamical patterns in drylands may help to unveil hotspots of current and future dynamical instabilities in drylands. Using a 20-y global satellite-derived temporal assessment of dryland Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), we show that 50% of all dryland ecosystems exhibiting gains or losses of NDVI are character-ized by abrupt positive/negative temporal dynamics. We further show that abrupt changes are more common among negative than positive NDVI trends and can be found in global regions suffering recent droughts, particularly around critical aridity thresholds. Positive abrupt dynamics are found most in ecosystems with low seasonal variability or high aridity. Our work unveils the high importance of climate variability on triggering abrupt shifts in vegetation and it provides missing evidence of increasing abruptness in systems intensively managed by humans, with low soil organic carbon contents, or around specific aridity thresholds. These results highlight that abrupt changes in dryland dynamics are very common, especially for productivity losses, pinpoint global hotspots of dryland vulnerability, and identify drivers that could be targeted for effective dryland management.

Field experiments investigatedweed suppression potential of spring-planted CCs and their effects on plant available water, crop yields, and net returns. The CC treatments were implemented during the fallow phase of NT wheat (Triticum aestivum L)-sorghum (Sorghum bicolor Moench)-fallow rotation at two locations: Brownell and Colby, over 3 yr in western Kansas. Treatments were oat-triticale (OT), oat-triticale-pea (Pisum sativum; OTP), spring pea, and fallow. Spring pea aboveground biomass was 3,290 kg ha-1, whereas OT produced 5,640 kg ha- 1 and OTP produced 5,260 kg ha-1. Regardless of location, weed biomass was reduced between 86 and 99% with CCs relative to weedy fallow. Cover crops reduced plant available water at winter wheat planting in three out of the six site-years. Averaged across years, CCs reduced winter wheat yields by 18% compared with fallow at Brownell but not at Colby. Replacing fallow with spring pea increased gross revenue but generated negative net returns because of high cost of herbicide and pea seed. Net return with OT or OTP CCs were negative in four out of six site-years when used strictly for weed suppression. However, net returns were mostly positive when OT ($110-876) or OTP (-$ 110-832) CCs were used as forage. Our results showed replacing fallow with spring-planted CCs for weed suppression in dryland cropping system is profitable only when the CCs are used for forage.

In this study, 119 trees with a diameter at breast height (dbh) between 3.82 and 45.48 cm were destructively sampled to evaluate aboveground biomass (AGB) allocation and prediction for four dryland species (Senegalia dudgeonii, Senegalia gourmaensis, Vachellia nilotica and Vachellia torahs) commonly found in the Sudanian and Sahelian zones of Burkina Faso. Biomass allocation to leaf, branch and stem was examined using a classmometric analysis. Allometric equations relating biomass to dbh alone, and to dbh in combination with height and/or crown area were developed with and without consideration of the additivity property. Branches stored the largest (up to 90%) proportion of AGB. For three of the species, the branch mass fraction increased with increasing tree size at the expense of stem and leaf mass fractions. The statistical evaluations of the selected additive and non-additive models were satisfactory with no severe deficiencies. Diagnostics of model performance revealed that non-additive models performed better than additive models. The biomass models developed can be used for improved quantification of carbon stock and dynamics in dry savanna ecosystems.

This study was conducted to evaluate the interspecific interaction and yield performance of silage maize (Zea mays L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) intercropping in response to N management and row arrangement under the rain-fed conditions on the Chinese Loess Plateau. Five planting arrangements, namely, sole maize, sole alfalfa, and maize and alfalfa intercropping in rows of 1:2 (I12), 2:2 (I22), and 2:4 (I24), were compared over a period of 4 years (2018-2021). Two N-levels (150 and 90 kg N ha(-1)) were applied to maize in each planting arrangement. Our results show that maize was the dominant species in 2018. In the next 3 years (2019-2021), maize was outcompeted by alfalfa during the first and second cuts of alfalfa, and complete recovery growth of maize was recorded at the third cut. The interspecific competition of I24 was less severe, resulting in a higher yield than I12 and I22. Although the reduction of N application reduced the biomass and crude protein (CP) yield, it weakened the interspecific competition and substantially increased the land equivalent ratio (LER). I24 under low N yielded more than sole cropping, with the LER based on biomass and CP yield of 1.01-1.12 and 1.08-1.18, respectively. In addition, I24 had the highest net revenue of 24,251 yen ha(-1) on average. Therefore, maize/alfalfa intercrop with a higher alfalfa proportion and a wide strip arrangement (I24) in combination with low N application could alleviate interspecific competition and improve forage production, which is suggested for our study region and similar dryland farming areas worldwide. Maize/alfalfa intercropping provides a basis for grain and livestock mixed farming and helps to improve food supply and resilience of the farming system.

PHYSIOLOGICAL, AGRONOMICAL AND QUALITY RESPONSE OF BREAD WHEAT TO PHOSPHORUS APPLICATION UNDER DRYLAND CONDITION	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												An understanding of physiological and agronomical traits associated with high grain yield and efficiency of phosphorus use is important to the improvement of genotypes under dryland conditions. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of differentiated phosphorus fertilization rate on the yield and quality of wheat at the experimental farm, University of Dicle, Diyarbakir, Turkey during 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 growing seasons. The experiment was consisted of five treatments comprising of five phosphorus (P2O5) levels (0 kg ha(-1), 30 kg ha(-1), 60 kg ha(-1), 90 kg ha(-1) and 120 kg ha(-1)). It was observed that phosphorus levels exhibited significant differences to the grain numbers per m(2), grain weight and grain yield ha', as well as to starch content and protein content in the first season. There was no significant effect of phosphorus on all studied grain yield and quality characters in the second season. The improvement in grain yield was significantly associated with the increase in the values of grain number, accordingly, the coefficients of grain number and grain yield showed that grain number had a positive and direct effect on grain yield suggesting a criteria trait to enhance yield. It was concluded that the highest grain yield of wheat crop was obtained with 120 kg ha(-1) P2O5 and it showed comparatively better performance than another treatment under investigation.

Contrasting tillage effects on stored soil water, infiltration and evapotranspiration fluxes in a dryland rotation at two locations	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												There are significant uncertainties in partitioning growing season precipitation into the water balance components that determine water available for dryland crop yield across a range of environments and tillage practices. We evaluated profile soil water contents at a high temporal resolution during phases of a dryland wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.)-fallow rotation under no tillage (NT)(1) and stubble-mulch tillage (ST) management at Bushland, Texas and Tribune, Kansas to assess event-based soil water balance components. Cumulative infiltration and evaporation were estimated based on hourly changes in stored soil water using a water balance approach and a drainage model. Estimated deep drainage comprised a small proportion of the soil water budget averaging five percent of annual precipitation in Bushland. Tillage did not significantly influence cumulative infiltration during summer fallow and growing season periods at Bushland. In contrast, NT at the Tribune location exhibited significantly greater (P = 0.023) cumulative infiltration compared to ST during the wheat fallow period just prior to sorghum planting. At both locations during summer fallow periods, NT was not more efficient in increasing stored soil water over that obtained with ST. Evaporation during summer fallow periods was more a function of the soil water content near the surface than the tillage practice. Effective infiltration expressed as a fraction of precipitation averaged 0.55 and 0.57 under NT and ST, respectively, at Bushland compared with 0.83 and 0.52 under NT and ST, respectively, at Tribune. Observations of effective infiltration elucidate historical results of the incremental sorghum grain yield response of NT over ST that averaged 12 percent at Bushland and 35 percent at Tribune. Partitioning of growing season precipitation to transpiration was insufficient in Bushland to generate yield increases under NT of similar magnitude to that observed in Tribune demonstrating that NT does not perform similarly across all environments.

However, no scientific knowledge is currently available on these dryland streams. We evaluated water quality, its relationship with the local geological characteristics, land uses, and the composition of aquatic macroinvertebrates (AM), analyzing their bioindicator potential. These results were discussed in relation to climate change predictions. The RS showed higher mineralization, salinity, hardness, water and air temperature, and low water quality index (WQI), relative to the RG. A discriminant analysis showed spatial (mineralization, salinity, and hardness in the RS) and temporal patterns (higher nitrogen compounds and temperature in the rainy season). The RS showed a lower AM diversity (40 taxa) compared to the RG (73 taxa); Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera reached higher values in the RG. A co-inertia analysis identified five groups of sites with different AM assemblages and water quality characteristics. Climate change predictions for the TCBR suggest increased aridity, higher temperature, and lower rainfall, leading to reduced river flow and increased salinity and mineralization. These could alter habitat features and connectivity, with loss of AM diversity, highlighting the vulnerability of these unique ecosystems to climate change.

To comprehen-sively safeguard the future food, water, and ecological security of drylands, this study examined the implications for FWLE linkages in a typical Chinese dryland from the perspective of future land-use change. First, four different land-use scenarios were proposed using a land-use simulation model with a gray multi-objective algorithm, including an SD scenario. Then, the variation of three ecosystem services was explored: water yield, food production, and habitat quality. Finally, redundancy analysis was used to derive the future drivers of FWLE and explore their causes. The fol-lowing results were obtained. In the future in Xinjiang, under the business as usual scenario, urbanization will con-tinue, forest area will decrease, and water production will decline by 371 million m3. In contrast, in the SD scenario, this negative impact will be substantially offset, water scarcity will be alleviated, and food production will increase by 1.05 million tons. In terms of drivers, the anthropogenic drivers will moderate the future urbanization of Xinjiang to some extent, with natural drivers dominating the sustainable development scenario by 2030 and a po-tential 22 % increase in the drivers of precipitation. This study shows how spatial optimization can help protect the sustainability of the FWLE nexus in drylands and simultaneously provides clear policy recommendations for regional development.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				JUN 1	2023	880								163183	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163183	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163183		APR 2023						37030378					WOS:000984548700001

However, the dryland-to-paddy conversion affects the ecological environment of areas of long-term dry farming, especially soil microorganisms. Little attention has been paid to the changes in microbial communities and the interactions between their populations in this process. Therefore, in this paper, the compositions and diversity of soil bacterial and fungal communities were explored through a combination of high-throughput sequencing technology and molecular ecological network methods using bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS. The results showed that: (1) both the abundance and diversity of soil bacteria and fungi decreased in a short time, and the abundance of Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Olpidiomycota varied greatly. (2) Compared to dry land, the modular structure of interaction networks and interspecific relationships of bacterial and fungal communities in paddy soil were simpler, and the network became more unstable. A cooperative relationship dominated in the molecular ecological network of bacteria, while a competitive relationship was dominant in the network of fungi. Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were the dominant bacterial species in dry land and paddy field, respectively. Ascomycota was dominant in the fungal communities of both dry land and paddy field. (3) The change in soil environmental factors, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic matter (OM) and available potassium (AK), directly affected the soil microbial community structure, showing a significant correlation (p < 0.05). These environmental factors also influenced the dominant microbial species. Microorganisms are the most important link in the carbon and nitrogen cycles of soil, and a large-scale dryland-to-paddy conversion may reduce the ecological stability of regional soil.

J	Wang, HB; Li, X; Ma, MG; Geng, LY				Wang, Haibo; Li, Xin; Ma, Mingguo; Geng, Liying			Improving Estimation of Gross Primary Production in Dryland Ecosystems by a Model-Data Fusion Approach	REMOTE SENSING												Accurate and continuous monitoring of the production of arid ecosystems is of great importance for global and regional carbon cycle estimation. However, the magnitude of carbon sequestration in arid regions and its contribution to the global carbon cycle is poorly understood due to the worldwide paucity of measurements of carbon exchange in arid ecosystems. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) gross primary productivity (GPP) product provides worldwide high-frequency monitoring of terrestrial GPP. While there have been a large number of studies to validate the MODIS GPP product with ground-based measurements over a range of biome types. Few studies have comprehensively validated the performance of MODIS estimates in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, especially for the newly released Collection 6 GPP products, whose resolution have been improved from 1000 m to 500 m. Thus, this study examined the performance of MODIS-derived GPP by compared with eddy covariance (EC)-observed GPP at different timescales for the main ecosystems in arid and semi-arid regions of China. Meanwhile, we also improved the estimation of MODIS GPP by using in situ meteorological forcing data and optimization of biome-specific parameters with the Bayesian approach. Our results revealed that the current MOD17A2H GPP algorithm could, on the whole, capture the broad trends of GPP at eight-day time scales for the most investigated sites. However, GPP was underestimated in some ecosystems in the arid region, especially for the irrigated cropland and forest ecosystems (with R-2 = 0.80, RMSE = 2.66 gC/m(2)/day and R-2 = 0.53, RMSE = 2.12 gC/m(2)/day, respectively). At the eight-day time scale, the slope of the original MOD17A2H GPP relative to the EC-based GPP was only 0.49, which showed significant underestimation compared with tower-based GPP. However, after using in situ meteorological data to optimize the biome-based parameters of MODIS GPP algorithm, the model could explain 91% of the EC-observed GPP of the sites. Our study revealed that the current MODIS GPP model works well after improving the maximum light-use efficiency (epsilon(max) or LUEmax), as well as the temperature and water-constrained parameters of the main ecosystems in the arid region. Nevertheless, there are still large uncertainties surrounding GPP modelling in dryland ecosystems, especially for desert ecosystems. Further improvements in GPP simulation in dryland ecosystems are needed in future studies, for example, improvements of remote sensing products and the GPP estimation algorithm, implementation of data-driven methods, or physiology models.

The effects of site preparation equal those of seeding at a dryland restoration site: 6 years of plant community development	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Dryland ecosystems generally require active restoration to recover from severe land degradation caused by resource and energy extraction operations. While seeding remains one of the most used forms of active restoration, land managers in dryland systems have generally had difficulty re-establishing desirable plant communities, due in part to alterations in supporting ecosystem processes and the episodic nature of resource availability. In this study, we examined the impacts of site preparation, seeding, and livestock grazing on developing plant communities after the construction of a buried natural gas pipeline corridor in the southwestern United States. We monitored plant species cover and composition beginning with the second season of growth through the sixth. Analysis of each individual year show that conclusions from the initial year of data collection did not well represent the findings in the following years. The site preparation and topsoil treatment had an ongoing positive effect on richness and cover compared to the nearby baseline conditions, while seeding only further increased cover and richness in the first year of monitoring (second season of growth). However, without seeding, the plant communities were driven by ruderal, annual species, whereas the seeded plant communities were driven by desirable seeded perennial grasses and forbs. Grazing and trampling effects were not significant overall, and the effects of livestock may have been confounded with effects of small mammals due to the exclosure configuration. We suggest that the site preparation, topsoil treatment, and configuration linearity of the disturbance corridor allowed for high levels of natural recruitment.

Hydraulic redistribution (HR) - the movement of water from wet to dry soil via roots - and canopy dew (CD) are crucial to water replenishment in dryland ecosystems. However, much is still not known about the response of CD and HR to soil water deficits (including no deficit, slight deficit, moderate deficit, and severe deficit water conditions) in dryland jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) plantations in China's Hilly Loess Region. To this end, the duration and intensity of dew were monitored using dielectric leaf wetness sensors to better understand the effects of soil water status on dew. Also, soil water content, sap flow, and meteorological variables were measured during the jujube growing seasons in 2017-2019. The results showed that the time of occurrence of CD under the no deficit condition came earlier than the time of occurrence of CD under slight, moderate, and severe soil water deficit conditions. Peak CD appeared at 5:00-6:30 am and ended at 6:30-9:00 am local time under the four soil water conditions. The amount, duration, and frequency of CD decreased with increasing soil water deficit. The amount and duration of CD under the no deficit condition were significantly higher than under the slight, moderate, and severe soil water deficit conditions (p < 0.05). The amount and frequency of HR (in the 20-60 cm soil layer) increased with increasing soil water deficit. Under the no deficit condition, HR was significantly lower than under the slight, moderate, and severe soil water deficit conditions (p < 0.05). While HR was influenced by CD, CD enhanced HR under the no deficit condition, but inhibited HR under slight, moderate, and severe soil water deficit conditions. For the growing season, the contribution of CD to total actual evapotranspiration (ETc act, CD/ ETc act ratio) was highest under the no deficit condition (maximum CD/ ETc act ratio of 0.21). The contribution of HR to ETc act (HR/ ETc act ratio) was higher under slight, moderate, and severe soil water deficit conditions (maximum of 0.11). The mutual effects of CD and HR lessened soil water deficit, making them important ecohydrological processes affecting the response of dryland jujube plantations to soil desiccation.

Non-native insects dominate daytime pollination in a high-elevation Hawaiian dryland ecosystem	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Premise of the Study Over one-third of the native flowering plant species in the Hawaiian Islands are listed as federally threatened or endangered. Lack of sufficient pollination could contribute to reductions in populations, reproduction, and genetic diversity among these species but has been little studied. Methods We used systematic observations and manual flower treatments to quantify flower visitation and outcrossing dependency of eight native (including four endangered) plant species in a dryland ecosystem in Hawaii: Argemone glauca, Bidens menziesii, Dubautia linearis, Haplostachys haplostachya, Sida fallax, Silene lanceolata, Stenogyne angustifolia, and Tetramolopium arenarium. Key Results During 576.36 h of flower observations, only insects visited the flowers. Out of all recorded flower visits, 85% were performed by non-native species, particularly the honeybee (Apis mellifera) and flies in the family Syrphidae. Some plant species received little visitation (e.g., S. angustifolia received one visit in 120 h of observation), whereas others were visited by a wide diversity of insects. The endangered plant species were visited by fewer visitor taxa than were the common native plant species. For six of the focal plant species, bagging of flowers to exclude pollinators resulted in significant reductions in seed set. Conclusions The flower visitor community in this system, although heavily dominated by non-native insects, appears to be facilitating pollination for multiple plant species. Non-native insects may thus be sustaining biotic interactions otherwise threatened with disruption in this island ecosystem. This may be particularly important for the studied endangered plant species, which exhibit fewer partners than the more common plant species.																			0002-9122	1537-2197				FEB	2019	106	2					313	324		10.1002/ajb2.1233	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajb2.1233								30768870					WOS:000459497400014

Empirical equations for estimating field capacity in dryland cropping soils of southeastern Australia	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												The root zone soil water content at field capacity, BFC, is often crucial for irrigation scheduling and soil-plantatmosphere modelling. Although BFC is traditionally determined using methodologies based on matric head or when water flux at the bottom of the root-zone equal to a prescribed negligible flux, these approaches can be problematic for some soils and applications. In this study, a novel water storage approach was used to estimate BFC for 11 soil texture classes in southeastern Australia (northwest Victoria) by employing the Soil-WaterAtmosphere-Plant (SWAP) model to simulate gravity drainage from saturation in the active root zone (top 60 cm). Field capacity was specified as the average root zone water content corresponding to a 1% relative change in daily soil water storage. We have also estimated flux-based BFC when prescribed flux at the bottom of the rootzone was 0.1 cm d-1. Three new empirical equations were developed to estimate storage-based BFC as a function of SWAP-simulated drainage flux out of the root zone, the n parameter of the van Genuchten function, and the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity, Ks, or the soil water content at - 100 cm matric head. We have evaluated these three new equations in addition to nine published equations for estimating BFC. The three new equations were found to be better predictors of BFC than most of the nine popular equations reported in the literature when compared to flux-based BFC values. Based on findings from this study the new equations are considered to be effective for irrigation scheduling and crop/climate modelling on the dryland soils of Victoria. Future studies will assess the applicability of the new equations to other parts of Australia.																			0167-1987	1879-3444				OCT	2023	234								105816	10.1016/j.still.2023.105816	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2023.105816		JUL 2023											WOS:001046556100001

Climate change impacts of drought on the livelihood of dryland smallholders: Implications of adaptation challenges	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION												This article explores the increasing impacts of recurrent droughts on dryland smallholders, caus-ing extensive damage to agriculture that impedes sustainable livelihoods and adaptation path-ways. This paper presents findings from research focusing upon five asset categories of livelihood approach, namely economic, social, natural, physical, and human capital, that are repeatedly ex-acerbated by the dynamics of repeated droughts. Focus group discussions were performed in four villages of Gorinabari union, Panchagarh district, northwest Bangladesh. This study explores the severe effects of drought on agronomic and livestock production, causing huge economic losses and unanticipated uncertainty to smallholders' livelihood activities. The findings infer several challenges that remain for undermining adaptive capacity associated with scarce modern tech-niques and knowledge, lacking agro-information, inadequate credit, capital inadequacy, agro-nomic damages, economic losses, and persistent drought episodes. The findings also suggest that smallholders' inability to adapt to changing situations causes much suffering during drought events. The results suggest that effective policy implementation, institutional arrangements, drought-resistant yields, poultry farming, livestock rearing, and small trading can expedite the smallholders' adaptive capacity to a given adverse condition in northern Bangladesh.

Comparing dryland cotton upland fibre quality from on-board spindle and stripper harvesting systems	JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE												On-board spindle and brush type stripper round module harvest systems were evaluated on commercial field scale for dryland Upland cotton in Australia over two harvest seasons. Observations on harvester performance, including harvesting efficiency, harvest loss, seed cotton yield and lint turn out were conducted at three locations, during the 2017 and 2018 cotton growing seasons, with a single variety. Fibre quality was measured by High Volume Instrumentation (HVI (TM)) and Advanced Fiber Information System (AFIS) and analysed to determine if there were any significant differences between the two harvesting systems. The stripper harvesters had higher productivity (i.e. hectares per hour), harvested more material with lower harvest loss than the spindle harvesters. The seed cotton harvested by the stripper systems contained plant material which resulted in a lower lint turn out than the spindle harvester although the yield in bales ha(-1) was still higher. There were no significant differences in fibre quality as measured by the HVI except for colour and trash. The significant differences in colour and trash did not affect the economic return to the grower as the visual colour and trash grades were below, i.e. better than, the Australian base grade. There were also no significant differences in the fibre quality as measured by AFIS. It is hypothesised that the reasons for this was due to the appropriate timing and application of defoliation, harvesting when moisture content <= 12%, reduced leaf allowing for gentler ginning and mature fibre.

However, the landscape composition affects multiple dimensions of pest control, and non-crop habitat surrounding farm fields shows variable responses across geographies. Here, crop damage and pest abundance were compared between local farms with two antagonistic land cover and land use aspects (1-High conservation, landscape with high structural complexity; 2-High degradation, landscapes with low complexity). The field data were collected at experimental guava orchards in the Cariri Paraibano, one of the driest regions in the Brazilian Caatinga. The results show that damage caused by orthopterans and their abundance was significantly smaller in the landscape with high structural complexity. Therefore, the results support the hypothesis that crop damage and pest abundance are smaller in landscapes with high structural complexity. Additionally, the results are very important for the dryland regions as they provide information about the relationship between landscape structure and crop damage plus pest abundance in a regional gap. As drylands are critically endangered in all American continents, sustainable agricultural landscapes with the application of natural cover restoration can help drylands to achieve sustainable development.

Dryland communities find little refuge from grazing due to long-term changes in water availability	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Surface water availability in drylands has changed with the introduction of artificial water points. Despite known ecological impacts, detailed mapping of this change has not occurred in most drylands. We aimed to quantify the extent and distribution of changes in water availability. We tested whether water availability increased more in pastorally productive areas than less fertile areas, and whether remaining water remote areas are restricted to low productivity landscapes. Our new spatially-explicit method mapped access to water at fine spatial scale, weighting locations by their distance to water and the permanence of those water sources. We demonstrated our method in a study area of over 700,000 km(2) in Queensland, Australia, with our mapping showing large changes in water availability since pastoral development. Less than 5% of the study area is now more than 10 km from water, compared with almost 60% previously. Few refuges for grazing-vulnerable communities remain. Even low fertility landscapes showed marked increases in water availability. This has conservation implications for managing production landscapes. Our approach can be applied in any dryland landscapes that have experienced changes in water availability, and can help guide actions such as removing artificial water points to recreate ecological refuges.

A comprehensive evaluation of twenty-one factors, primarily derived from Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and satellite data, was conducted against a database of 3822 groundwater discharge points. The majority of them consisted of shallow wells with relatively low yields. The main objective was to develop a groundwater potential (GWP) map for the study area. Among the factors considered, six variables, including two anthropogenic factors (distance to roads and presence of agricultural communities) and four natural factors (slope, elevation, concavity, and ruggedness index), were identified as the most influential indicators of GWP. The RF approach demonstrated excellent performance, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 0.95, sensitivity of 0.88, specificity of 0.86, and kappa coefficient of 0.74 in the test set. The majority of the study area exhibited low GWP, while only 14% of the area demonstrated high or very high GWP. In addition to providing valuable guidance for future hydrogeological investigations in the region, the GWP map serves as a valuable tool for identifying the areas that are most vulnerable to water shortages. This is particularly significant, as the region has been severely affected by extended drought, making water supply a critical concern.

J	Wohl, E; Scamardo, J				Wohl, Ellen; Scamardo, Julianne			Patterns of organic matter accumulation in dryland river corridors of the southwestern United States	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												We use Google Earth imagery, drone imagery, and ground-based field measurements to assess the abundance, spatial distribution, and size of accumulations of organic matter in perennial, intermittent, and ephemeral channels in dry lands of the southwestern United States. We refer to these accumulations as organic matter jams (OMJs). We examine correlations between OMJ characteristics and indicators of spatial heterogeneity within river corridors. We hypothesize that OMJs occur primarily in association with obstacles such as living woody vegetation and that spatially heterogeneous river corridors have greater numbers of OMJs per surface area of river corridor. Using data from 19 river reaches across four areas in Arizona and Utah, we find that OMJs are preferentially associated with bars in the active channel and with living woody vegetation in the channel and floodplain. We also find that whether greater spatial heterogeneity corresponds to greater spatial density of OMJs can be influenced by downstream distance from major sources of large wood and organic matter and whether the river corridor is supply-or transport-limited with respect to organic matter. Consequently, the strongest influence on OMJ location and abundance can vary between individual reaches of a river corridor and between watersheds. The abundance and size of OMJs in river corridors of sparsely vegetated drylands fall within the ranges of values published for perennial river corridors in wetter climates. We suggest that management of dryland river corridors explicitly include protecting and restoring organic matter accumulations in these environments.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				AUG 10	2022	833								155136	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155136	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155136		APR 2022						35405232					WOS:000793815900004

Nitrogen fertilizer applications at the right rate and time in the growing season are important for optimizing wheat grain yield and quality. Two dryland field experiments were conducted in North Central Montana in 2014. The effects of N fertilizer rates (28, 84, and 140 kg N ha(-1)) and application times (seeding, tillering, jointing, and flag leaf emergence) on grain yield, test weight, protein content, protein yield, grain N uptake, and N use efficiency (NUE) were evaluated. Wheat grain yield and protein content was the highest with N fertilizer applied at 140 kg N ha(-1) rate at tillering. Delaying N fertilizer until flag leaf resulted in significantly lower wheat yields and grain protein values. It is possible that higher N rates would have allowed to maximize both yield and protein content. Nitrogen use efficiency was the highest with N fertilization at tillering and jointing. Nitrogen response trials coupled with historical yield records did not provide accurate estimates of optimum N rates. Close monitoring of crop nutrient status throughout the growing season (using destructive sampling and/or crop sensors), coupled with appropriate preplant soil testing, and splitting N applications to tailor N supply with crop demand should help to improve NUE.

Here, we undertook a broad appraisal of the abundance, diversity, similarity, community assembly, network properties and functions of soil microbiomes in 82 dryland grasslands along environmental gradients. We found that the bacterial and fungal diversity and community similarity showed different sensitivities to environmental stress (decreased mean annual precipitation (MAP) and soil nutrient levels and increased soil pH), and MAP was the most important factor influencing microbial community patterns. In addition, the dominant subcommunity of both bacteria and fungi was more sensitive to environmental stress than the nondominant subcommunity. Although increasing environmental stress decreased microbial phylogenetic clustering, it had no effects on the stochastic and deterministic assembly process balance. Moreover, we identified 101 bacterial and 34 fungal environmental stress-discriminatory taxa that were sensitive to environmental stress, and these bacterial markers showed a high correlation with the abundance of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling-related genes, whereas the taxa classified as connectors in the network were mainly correlated with C degradation genes. Our study shows that the different responses of bacteria and fungi to environmental stress bring challenges to predicting microbial function, but a relatively small number of taxa play an important role in driving C and N cycling-related functional genes, indicating that identifying an organism's phenotypic characteristics or traits of key taxa may improve our knowledge of the microbial response to ongoing global changes.					贾, 晓宇/AHB-0724-2022; Yan, Weiming/CAG-9069-2022	贾, 晓宇/0000-0001-6011-1472; Yan, Weiming/0000-0001-5509-0806													0048-9697	1879-1026				APR 15	2022	817								152991	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.152991	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.152991		JAN 2022						35026259					WOS:000793348100007

Precipitation legacies amplify ecosystem nitrogen losses from nitric oxide emissions in a Pinyon-Juniper dryland	ECOLOGY												Climate change is increasing the variability of precipitation, altering the frequency of soil drying-wetting events and the distribution of seasonal precipitation. These changes in precipitation can alter nitrogen (N) cycling and stimulate nitric oxide (NO) emissions (an air pollutant at high concentrations), which may vary according to legacies of past precipitation and represent a pathway for ecosystem N loss. To identify whether precipitation legacies affect NO emissions, we excluded or added precipitation during the winter growing season in a Pinyon-Juniper dryland and measured in situ NO emissions following experimental wetting. We found that the legacy of both excluding and adding winter precipitation increased NO emissions early in the following summer; cumulative NO emissions from the winter precipitation exclusion plots (2750 +/- 972 mu g N-NO m(-2)) and winter water addition plots (2449 +/- 408 mu g N-NO m(-2)) were higher than control plots (1506 +/- 397 mu g N-NO m(-2)). The increase in NO emissions with previous precipitation exclusion was associated with inorganic N accumulation, while the increase in NO emissions with previous water addition was associated with an upward trend in microbial biomass. Precipitation legacies can accelerate soil NO emissions and may amplify ecosystem N loss in response to more variable precipitation.

Therefore, we selected 36 plots of desert and 32 plots of grassland (10 x 10 m) from a typical dryland region of northwest China. We calculated the alpha and beta components of TD, FD and PD for 68 dryland plant communities using Rao quadratic entropy index, which included 233 plant species. Redundancy analyses and variation partitioning analyses were used to explore the relative influence of environmental and spatial factors on the above three facets of diversity, at the alpha and beta scales. We found that soil, climate, topography and spatial structures (principal coordinates of neighbor matrices) were significantly correlated with TD, FD and PD at both alpha and beta scales, implying that these diversity patterns are shaped by contemporary environment and spatial processes together. However, we also found that alpha diversity was predominantly regulated by spatial structure, whereas beta diversity was largely determined by environmental variables. Among environmental factors, TD was most strongly correlated with climatic factors at the alpha scale, while with soil factors at the beta scale. FD was only significantly correlated with soil factors at the alpha scale, but with altitude, soil and climatic factors at the beta scale. In contrast, PD was more strongly correlated with altitude at the alpha scale, but with soil factors at the beta scale. Environment and space explained a smaller portion of variance in PD than in TD and FD. These results provide robust evidence that the ecological drivers of biodiversity differ among different scales and facets of diversity. Future research that focuses on the comparisons among TD, FD and PD would likely provide new insights into elucidating the underlying community assembly.					lu, qi/HHS-2115-2022														2167-8359					JAN 10	2019	6								e6220	10.7717/peerj.6220	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.6220								30648001					WOS:000455373100004

Yet, quantification of urban greening trends in drylands is still lacking. We have modeled urban greenness dynamics and its determinants, using Landsat-based time-series analyses of NDVI and census data, of 23 localities along a dryland climatic gradient in southern Israel, between 1997 and 2019. NDVI trends and their associated temporal changes in local average wages, age of locality, and average annual rainfall were analyzed by exploiting a panel structure and model parameters estimation with fixed effects to control for unobserved differences between localities, and to strengthen causal interpretation. Results show positive NDVI trends in all localities-indicating that urban construction increases greenness in drylands. However, the localities varied greatly in the slopes of their respective linear NDVI trends (0.05 <alpha < 0.161). Specifically, we found that, ceteris paribus, the differences in average wages between localities is the most important factor in explaining spatio-temporal differences be-tween the respective NDVI of localities. Given the well-known high correlation between individuals' wages and other characteristic such as education and income (all important determinants of the Socio-Economic classifi-cation of local authorities), this leads us to conclude that residents' economic characteristics are an important predictor of the level of greenness. Harlin's Granger causality test for wages and NDVI panel data indicate that wage is a Granger cause of urban greenness (p < 0.001)-however, greenness was not found to be the driving force of wage.

The examined treatments included water availability (dryland and SI), wheat cultivars (Homa, Sardari, Rijaw, Ouhadi, and Azar2), and foliar application of urea (control and 4% urea foliar application). The results demonstrated that SI (10%) reduced and urea foliar (12%) application increased the percent of grain protein. SI reduced the contents of three PAs by 24%: spermine, spermidine, and putrescine. But urea foliar application increased the three PAs in the first and second years by 31% and 27% in dryland conditions and 12% and 4% in SI conditions, respectively. These results indicated that there is less need for PAs in SI conditions, and they thus exhibit poorer accumulation in the grain; in dryland conditions, however, their content increases with greater access to foliar nitrogen. Older cultivars Sardari and Azar 2 had more polyamines. According to the observed positive correlation between 1000-grain weight and the three PAs under stress conditions, PAs are probably involved in the improvement of grain filling, and urea foliar application can affect drought tolerance by increasing PA accumulation. Moreover, cadaverine exhibited a different function from the other PAs.

This study investigated the gum ratio and yield, emulsion capacity and stability, and diosgenin and protein content of 18 fenugreek genotypes and three cultivars cultivated under irrigated and dryland conditions. A wide range in the values of the samples traits was observed, including gum ratio (47.71-79.84%), gum yield (214.30-817.10 kg/ha), emulsion stability (84.62-100%), emulsion capacity (91.11-100%), diosgenin content (0.26-1.42%), and crude protein content (19.16-30.09%) under irrigated and dryland conditions. The PI 639185 and PI 660995 genotypes were superior, with the highest gum ratio and yield, and diosgenin content, compared with the other genotypes. In addition, the Berkem cultivar and PI 613633 genotype had the highest crude protein content. Fifteen correlations were found, positive or negative, and PCA analysis revealed 49.16% total variation. The fenugreek genotypes and cultivars were divided into two main groups; over 57% of the genotypes and 66% of the cultivars fell into the same group. The study suggested that the important genotypic variation for the properties of the examined fenugreek genotypes and cultivars may be utilized in developing new cultivars.

L.; Singh, Chandni; Spear, Dian; Mensah, Adelina M.; Ansah, Prince			Everyday mobility and changing livelihood trajectories: implications for vulnerability and adaptation in dryland regions	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY												Dryland regions are highly dynamic environments in which multiple pressures intersect, threatening livelihood security. Mobility is an integral feature in these environments and represents a key risk management strategy for people to respond to frequent livelihood shocks and stresses. Global environmental change scholarship has tended to articulate spatial and temporal change inadequately, portraying populations in a way that belies their socially differentiated and inherently mobile livelihoods. We explored the role of mobility as an ongoing, "everyday" adaptive response to changing environmental, economic, and social conditions. We draw on 21 Life History (LH) interviews to explore the drivers and outcomes of people's mobility behavior in drylands of Ghana, Kenya, Namibia, and India. We present the adaptation option space (AOS) as a novel theoretical development to explore livelihood trajectories. Within our cases, we found that mobility was ubiquitous and facilitated changes to and exchanges within people's risk profiles in three main ways: novelty (risks gained or lost), modification (risks attenuated or accentuated), and no change. Temporal analysis showed three broad trajectories in people's lives set within broader structural constraints: upward, downward, and stable, depending on people's abilities to manage their AOS. The analysis confirmed that the AOS was a useful heuristic to understand how people exert agency to respond to an array of converging risks while negotiating broader drivers of change. Moreover, the data demonstrated how compounding shocks had negative impacts on people, highlighting the value of temporally-sensitive approaches.

Biosolids and conservation tillage for rainfed wheat farming in dry Mediterranean climates	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Biosolids are used in dryland wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production in eastern Washington and other regions of the world as a source of nutrients and to increase soil organic carbon (SOC). Moreover, conservation tillage is promoted to reduce erosion and soil degradation. We explored the impacts of biosolids vs synthetic fertilizer in combination with undercutter (UC) conservation tillage vs tandem disk (TD) traditional tillage in an 8-yr field experiment in drought-prone region near Lind, WA (244 mm avg. annual precipitation). There were two sets of plots to allow for data collection each year in a 2-yr winter wheat (WW)-fallow rotation. Biosolids were applied at 6.5 mt/ha dry weight to meet the nutrient needs of two WW crops. Synthetic fertilizer plots received 56 kg N plus 11 kg S/ha for every wheat crop. Biosolids increased WW grain yield vs synthetic fertilizer by 25% one year but with no differences in other years or the 8-yr avg. Tillage method had no effect on WW grain yield nor grain yield components. Wheat kernel weight was lower and grain protein higher than desirable in biosolids plots, indicating excessive N because the application rate was too high for such a dry environment. Consistent year-long surface residue cover > 30% was achieved with UC tillage for government farm program conservation compliance, but this was not attained with TD tillage. In addition to highly desirable levels of P, biosolids provided significant quantities of the important soil micronutrients Zn, Mn, Cu, Fe. Biosolids application did not increase SOC in the surface 30 cm. This study demonstrated the application of biosolids combined with lowdisturbance UC conservation tillage is an agronomically- and environmentally sound practice for dryland wheat production. We believe this is the driest rainfed environment in which biosolids for crop production have yet been evaluated.

Appropriate selection of crop sequences will be of importance to cope with these climatic changes for this largest grain-producing region of Australia. Through linking a widely used crop model (APSIM), 26 General Circulation Models (GCMs) with one Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP585) and economic analysis, we explored how the climate change would affect dryland wheat cropping and whether/how long fallow (the practice of leaving a field out of production for an entire growing season) could be integrated into wheat cropping system in Western Australia. The potential adaptation of long fallow into wheat system was assessed with four fixed rotations (fallow-wheat, fallow-wheat-wheat, fallow-wheat-wheat-wheat, and fallow-wheat-wheat-wheat-wheat) and four flexible sowing rule-based rotations (the land was fallowed if sowing rule was not met), compared with continuous wheat. The simulation results at four representing locations show that climate change would have negative impacts on both yield and economic return of continuous wheat cropping in Western Australia. Wheat after fallow out-yielded and outprofited wheat after wheat under future climate. But integrating fallow into wheat cropping systems with the above fixed rotations would lead to yield and economic loss. By contrast, cropping systems in which fallowing took place when sowing condition could not be met at a certain time would achieve comparable yield and economic return to continuous wheat, with wheat yield being only 5 % less than continuous wheat and the gross margin being $12 ha-1 more than continuous wheat averaged across locations. We highlight strategic integration of long fallow into cropping sys-tem in a dryland Mediterranean-type environment would have a great potential to cope with future climate change. These findings can be extended into other Mediterranean-type cropping regions in Australia and beyond.

Morphological and physiological traits in relation to carbon balance in a diverse clade of dryland mosses	PLANT CELL AND ENVIRONMENT												Plant functional trait analyses have focused almost exclusively on vascular plants, but bryophytes comprise ancient and diverse plant lineages that have widespread global distributions and important ecological functions in terrestrial ecosystems. We examined a diverse clade of dryland mosses, Syntrichia, and studied carbon balance during a precipitation event (C-balance), a functional trait related to physiological functioning, desiccation tolerance, survival, and ecosystem carbon and nitrogen cycling. We examined variability in C-balance among 14 genotypes of Syntrichia and measured an additional 10 physiological and 13 morphological traits at the cell, leaf, shoot, and clump level. C-balance varied 20-fold among genotypes, and highest C-balances were associated with long, narrow leaves with awns, and small cells with thick cell walls, traits that may influence water uptake and retention during a precipitation event. Ordination analyses revealed that the axis most strongly correlated with C-balance included the maximum chlorophyll fluorescence, F-m, indicating the importance of photosystem II health for C exchange. C-balance represents a key functional trait in bryophytes, but its measurement is time intensive and not feasible to measure on large scales. We propose two models (using physiological and morphological traits) to predict C-balance, whereby identifying simpler to measure traits for trait databases.

The SH was measured for a long-term (16 yr) dryland field experiment on a Dark Brown clay loam soil in southern Alberta, Canada. Mean SH was significantly (P <= 0.05) greater in rotations with grass, perennial crops, manure application, and continuous cropping; whereas cereal-legume rotations and N fertilizer effects were undetectable.

Monitoring exotic annual grass cover and dynamics over large areas requires the use of remote sensing that can support early detection and rapid response initiatives. However, few studies have leveraged remote sensing technologies and computing frameworks capable of providing rangeland managers with maps of exotic annual grass cover at relatively high spatiotemporal resolutions and near real-time latencies. Here, we developed a system for automated mapping of invasive annual grass (%) cover using in situ observations, harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data, maps of biophysical variables, and machine learning techniques. A robust and automated cloud, cloud shadow, water, and snow/ice masking procedure (mean overall accuracy >81%) was implemented using time-series outlier detection and data mining techniques prior to spatiotemporal interpolation of HLS data via regression tree models (r = 0.94; mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.02). Weekly, cloud-free normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) image composites (2016-2018) were used to construct a suite of spectral and phenological metrics (e.g., start and end of season dates), consistent with information derived from Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. These metrics were incorporated into a data mining framework that accurately (r = 0.83; MAE = 11) modeled and mapped exotic annual grass (%) cover throughout dryland ecosystems in the western United States at a native, 30-m spatial resolution. Our results show that inclusion of weekly HLS time-series data and derived indicators improves our ability to map exotic annual grass cover, as compared to distribution models that use MODIS products or monthly, seasonal, or annual HLS composites as primary inputs. This research fills a critical gap in our ability to effectively assess, manage, and monitor drylands by providing a framework that allows for an accurate and timely depiction of land surface phenology and exotic annual grass cover at spatial and temporal resolutions that are meaningful to local resource managers.

This study investigated the distribution characteristics of the SWC and SOC content for the 0-500 cm soil layer in 11 croplands and 39 shrublands planted on a former cropland over 50 years ago. The coupled and trade-off relationship between soil water consumption and carbon fixation in the shrubland soil was also analyzed. The results showed that the SOC content and SWC of the shrublands and croplands varied with soil depth, but their distribution patterns were similar under both land-use types. Planting shrubs on slopes reduced the SWC but did not significantly enhance the SOC content, indicating that cropland-to-shrubland conversion results in excessive soil water depletion without increasing carbon fixa-tion in the soil. Additionally, both the SOC content and SWC of the shrublands varied significantly with slope positions (p < 0.05) and showed intermediate coordination levels across the entire slope. Moreover, the SOC content provided higher benefits than SWC, where the foot slope showing a relatively higher coupling coordi-nation degree and a lower trade-off than other slope positions. These results suggest that shrubs provide a limited contribution to improve SOC stocks in the drylands of the Loess Plateau and that reductions in deep soil water under cropland-to-shrubland conversion require consideration when planning future ecological restoration measures. To improve ecosystem services (carbon sequestration and soil conservation) without compromising water resources in the drylands of the Loess Plateau or similar regions worldwide, it is necessary to fully consider the slope position and the trade-off between the SWC and SOC content.

Here, we use fossil pollen records from two cores recovered from Balikun Lake, eastern Tien Shan, to reconstruct regional Holocene vegetation dynamics and environmental change. These records are combined with present-day pollen assemblages measured in samples from airborne pollen traps and soils across the catchment. We find that halophytes from saline-alkali habitats dominated the traps and near-shore surface samples, implying that halophytes are the primary local pollen source when the lake-shore environment becomes drier. A high relative abundance of Chenopodioideae pollen during the early Holocene in our near lakeshore (BLK06) core implies significant shrinkage of the lake area, linked to increased aridity across the MLA. When combined with inferred low temperatures, we propose a widespread expansion of desert vegetation under cold-and-dry conditions. A consistent abundance of Pinus, Picea, Betula pollen in both cores implies a common source areas characterized by widespread forests, in addition to locally-derived pollen, during the mid-Holocene. We infer that these changes correspond to increasing growing degree days, promoted by ice sheet retreat and increased winter insolation during the mid-Holocene. This allowed alpine forests to expand extensively along the Tien Shan Mountain. In the late Holocene, tree cover gradually shrunk as temperate grassland expanded in response to increased effective moisture, associated with increased intensity of westerlies coupled with lower temperatures linked to decreased insolation. We propose that rising temperatures in the recent past and near future will act to enhance the glacial meltwater supply in the MLA drylands, yielding an increase in both the growing degree days and the moisture conditions, which will drive expansion of the mountain forest and grassland biomes.					li, wei/IUQ-2973-2023; wang, yu/IUQ-6654-2023; wang, chen/JED-7289-2023; li, yuan/GZH-3511-2022; wang, xiao/HZI-9156-2023; liu, junyang/IXD-1201-2023; zheng, xin/JNS-5523-2023; liu, jiaming/IWE-3196-2023														0341-8162	1872-6887				JUN	2022	213								106212	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106212	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106212		MAR 2022											WOS:000821279600007

The future condition of this important biome will depend on its capability to resist and recover from these disturbances. So far, the temporal stability of dryland forests is rarely studied, even though identifying the important factors associated with the stability of the dryland forests could serve as a basis for forest management and restoration. Methodology In a degraded dry Afromontane forest in northern Ethiopia, we explored remote sensing derived indicators of forest stability, using MODIS satellite derived NDVI time series from 2001 to 2018. Resilience and resistance were measured using the anomalies (remainders) after time series decomposition into seasonality, trend and remainder components. Growth stability was calculated using the integral of the undecomposed NDVI data. These NDVI derived stability indicators were then related to environmental factors of climate, topography, soil, tree species diversity, and local human disturbance, obtained from a systematic grid of field inventory plots, using boosted regression trees in R. Results Resilience and resistance were adequately predicted by these factors with an R-2 of 0.67 and 0.48, respectively, but the model for growth stability was weaker. Precipitation of the wettest month, distance from settlements and slope were the most important factors associated with resilience, explaining 51% of the effect. Altitude, temperature seasonality and humus accumulation were the significant factors associated with the resistance of the forest, explaining 61% of the overall effect. A positive effect of tree diversity on resilience was also important, except that the impact of species evenness declined above a threshold value of 0.70, indicating that perfect evenness reduced the resilience of the forest. Precipitation of the wettest month was the most important factor explaining 43.52% of the growth stability variation. Conclusion A combination of climate, topographic factors and local human disturbance controlled the stability of the dry forest. Also tree diversity is an important stability component that should be considered in the management and restoration programs of such degraded forests. If local disturbances are alleviated the recovery time of dryland forests could be shortened, which is vital to maintain the ecosystem services these forests provide to local communities and global climate change.

Intensifying cereal management in dryland Mediterranean agriculture: Rainfed wheat and barley responses to nitrogen fertilisation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												Under dryland systems of the Mediterranean basin, water management is widely recognised critical for improving grain yield. It has been proposed that nitrogen (N) fertilisation may be a tool to increase grain yield by increasing water use efficiency. We tested in a multilocation-multiyear study in four different areas of the Mediterranean Basin if durum wheat and barley may respond positively to N fertilisation under rainfed cultivation. The study involved 16 experiments including different genotypes of durum wheat and barley sown at Morocco, Jordan, North-eastern Spain, and Southern Italy, with different nitrogen doses applied at sowing or early in crop development from 2003/04-2007/08 growing seasons. Grain yield increased 26% in average for years, locations and species compared with their respective unfertilised controls. The increased yield in response to N fertilisation was noticeable under low (< 2 Mg ha(-1)) and under high yield potential cases (> 5 Mg ha(-1)). There were only exceptional cases with slightly negative or no responses to N fertilisation. Grain number per unit area, and not grain weight, was the main component related to grain yield. Also, total biomass at maturity was closely related to grain yield. Barley and durum wheat responded similarly to N fertilisation.

J	Xu, HJ; Zhao, CY; Wang, XP				Xu, Hao-jie; Zhao, Chuan-yan; Wang, Xin-ping			Spatiotemporal differentiation of the terrestrial gross primary production response to climate constraints in a dryland mountain ecosystem of northwestern China	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Monitoring seasonal and interannual variability in gross primary production (GPP) and attributing these changes to climate change across various ecosystems helps to predict the future climate-carbon cycle feedback. However, such studies are scarce in dryland mountain ecosystems, possibly because of high spatial heterogeneity in landscapes and terrain. To better understand how carbon fluxes of the dryland mountain ecosystem respond to meteorology, we identified the trend and driving mechanism related to GPP in the Qilian Mountains (QLMs) of northwestern China from 2000 to 2016 by adopting the vegetation photosynthesis model that incorporates satellite and meteorological data. Our results revealed contrasting GPP trends in the growing season (May-September) between 2000-2010 and 2010-2016. In the later period, widespread GPP reductions were found across almost the whole area, especially at the middle and end of the growing season. In the central part of the QLMs, GPP reductions were induced by warming hiatus in contrast to drought in the western and eastern parts. Responses of GPP to temperature, precipitation and solar radiation differed in seasons and biomes. The positive effect of rising temperature that increased GPP was dominant during the growing season. The interannual variability in GPP was positively related to precipitation in June and July, but was negatively related to precipitation in other months. A positive correlation between forest GPP and solar radiation occurred in all months but July. Desert GPP responded negatively to solar radiation in all months but September. Temperature and solar radiation accounted for most of the interannual variability in forest GPP. Temperature was the major climate constraints on the interannual variability in grassland GPP. Precipitation and solar radiation primarily controlled the interannual variability in desert GPP from July to September, while temperature became more limited than precipitation and solar radiation for desert GPP in May and June.

We investigated the composition of bioaerosols, ice nucleation activity, and the effect of rainfall by metagenomic sequencing and freezing experiments of aerosol samples collected during the INUIT 2016 campaign in a rural dryland on the eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus. Taxonomic analysis showed community changes related to rainfall. For the rain-affected samples, we found higher read proportions of fungi, particularly of Agaricomycetes, which are a class of fungi that actively discharge their spores into the atmosphere in response to humidity changes. In contrast, the read proportions of bacteria were reduced, indicating an effective removal of bacteria by precipitation. Freezing experiments showed that the IN population in the investigated samples was influenced by both rainfall and dust events. For example, filtration and heat treatment of the samples collected during and immediately after rainfall yielded enhanced fractions of heat-sensitive IN in the size ranges larger than 5 mu m and smaller than 0.1 mu m, which were likely of biological origin (entire bioparticles and soluble macromolecular bio-IN). In contrast, samples collected in periods with dust events were dominated by heat-resistant IN active at lower temperatures, most likely mineral dust. The DNA analysis revealed low numbers of reads related to microorganisms that are known to be IN-active. This may reflect unknown sources of atmospheric bio-IN as well as the presence of cell-free IN macromolecules that do not contain DNA, in particular for sizes < 0.1 mu m. The observed effects of rainfall on the composition of atmospheric bioaerosols and IN may influence the hydrological cycle (bioprecipitation cycle) as well as the health effects of air particulate matter (pathogens, allergens).

M.; Zhan, Ai; Fang, Quanxiao; Yu, Qiang			Soil microbial community and network changes after long-term use of plastic mulch and nitrogen fertilization on semiarid farmland	GEODERMA												Soil microbes are crucial for improving soil quality and productivity. Plastic film mulch (FM), in conjunction with fertilization, has significantly improved crop yields over vast areas of dryland production. However, how these practices affect soil microbial communities, especially as regards co-occurrence patterns within microbial taxa, is unclear. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of 10 years of FM and four nitrogen (N) fertilization rates [0 (N0), 100 (N100), 250 (N250), and 400 (N400) kg N ha(-1)] on soil bacterial and fungal diversity, community structure, composition, and the co-occurrence network in a rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) field on the Loess Plateau of China. Results showed that N fertilization and FM did not affect soil microbial biomass carbon, but these practices changed the soil bacterial and fungal community structures. The bacterial community structure was dominantly affected by N fertilization, owing to the increased soil N content and decreased soil pH, which reduced bacterial community diversity and altered the relative abundance of some copiotrophic/oligotrophic taxa (e.g., Gemmatimonadetes, Acidobacteria, Rokubacteria, and Planctomycetes). Plastic mulch played a greater role in regulating the fungal community structure, primarily because FM increased soil moisture and promoted soil organic matter decomposition, thereby reducing fungal richness and altered the relative abundance of Chytridiomycota, Mortierellomycota, Glomeromycota, and Mucoromycota. Moreover, FM mediated the effects of N fertilization by reducing soil N content, and then increased the N threshold that caused changes in microbial structure. Network analysis indicated that FM caused an unstable co-occurrence network with fewer positive and negative links, while N fertilization increased both positive and negative (except N400) links, indicating enhanced cooperation and competition among microbes. These results indicate that long-term plastic mulch and high N fertilization could result in risk for soil quality in terms of soil microbial community structure and stability, suggesting that developing new management strategies is necessary to sustain dryland productivity.

These issues are mainly pronounced in the inland arid area. The ecological environment's deterioration is especially severe in the drylands of the interior. However, dryland wetland changes and their response to climate are poorly understood. This study uses the K-means algorithm in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to classify two typical dryland wetlands (Ebinur and Bosten Lakes) for rapidly and accurately detecting dryland wetland changes. Moreover, it explores the long-term spatial-temporal variation in wetland distribution. In addition, it investigates the response of various lakes to climate change in northern and southern Xinjiang using wavelet analysis. The study's results showed that K-means clustering in the GEE platform has a high classification accuracy (Kappa > 0.8) in wetland classification, making it a feasible approach. The terminal lake wetland types, represented by the Ebinur Lake, changed significantly between 2001 and 2021. In contrast, the inflow-outflow lake wetland types, represented by the Bosten Lake, perform more consistently. Significant spatial-temporal variation is observed at Ebinur Lake, with the lake gradually shrinking and trans-forming into a marsh, where the largest marsh proportion degrades into non-wetland during the year. Bosten Lake experienced frequent conversions between marsh and non-wetland throughout the year. Furthermore, the responses of various dryland lakes to climate change are consistent, and a low precedes precipitation and follows evapotranspiration. However, their sensitivity to climate response varies, with the terminal lake being most affected by climate change. Mastering the dynamic changes and climate response of dryland wetlands achieves the sustainable development goals of drylands, including carbon neutrality and peak carbon dioxide emissions.

Here, we aimed to characterize nonlinear changes in dryland vegetation greenness over East Inner Mongolia, an ecotone of forest-grassland-cropland in northern China, with time series of Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and GEOV2 leaf area index (LAI) values during 2000 to 2016. Changes in the growing season EVI and LAI were detected with the polynomial change fitting method. This method characterizes nonlinear changes in time series by polynomial fitting with the highest polynomial order of three, and simultaneously provides an estimation of monotonic trends over the time series by linear fitting. The relative contribution of climatic factors (precipitation and temperature) to changes in the EVI and LAI were analyzed using linear regression. In general, we observed similar patterns of change in the EVI and LAI. Nonlinear changes in the EVI were detected for about 21% of the region, and for the LAI, the percentage of nonlinear changes was about 16%. The major types of nonlinear changes include decrease-increase, decrease-increase-decrease, and increase-decrease-increase changes. For the overall monotonic trends, very small percentages of decrease (less than 1%) and widespread increases in the EVI and LAI were detected. Furthermore, large areas where the effects of climate variation on vegetation changes were not significant were observed for all major types of change in the grasslands and rainfed croplands. Changes with an increase-decrease-increase process had large percentages of non-significant effects of climate. The further analysis of increase-decrease-increase changes in different regions suggest that the increasing phases were likely to be mainly driven by human activities, and droughts induced the decreasing phase. In particular, some increase-decrease changes were observed around the large patch of bare areas. This may be an early signal of degradation, to which more attention needs to be paid to combat desertification.

For waterbirds depending on Australia's dryland rivers, little is known about the spatiotemporal dynamics and degree of population synchrony, despite its importance for conservation theory and practice. We examined spatial synchrony in 50 waterbird species using aerial survey data over the past three decades (1983-2016), across two of Australia's largest river basins, representing almost a third of the continent using state-space models. There was broad synchrony in the responses of Australian waterbird numbers in wetlands, varying among functional response groups, reflecting the spatiotemporal mosaic of flooded wetlands across multiple scales. Ducks, the most abundant functional response group, and herbivorous waterbirds displayed strong spatiotemporal synchrony within and between the Lake Eyre Basin and Murray-Darling Basin, while synchrony of piscivores was patchier. In contrast, large waders and particularly shorebirds had poor synchronicity. While rainfall among catchments within river basins was highly correlated, streamflow was correspondingly weakly correlated in the Murray-Darling Basin primarily because river regulation had separated rainfall from flow and inundation, potentially compromising waterbird response triggers. There are clear conservation implications for wetlands and their waterbird populations, principally the protection of natural flow regimes in the Lake Eyre Basin and where needed, restoration of environmental flows in the Murray-Darling Basin. Also, management of waterbirds needs to often extend beyond the boundaries of basins.

Nutrient-acquisition strategy influences seed nutrient concentration and seed-to-seedling transition in ecological restoration in a regional dryland flora	PLANT AND SOIL												Purpose Seed-to-seedling transition is a primary bottleneck in dryland and post-mining ecological restoration. The role of internal seed nutrent characteristics in this critical transition remains poorly understood, despite its possible utility to inform species selection for restoration. Methods Seed mass and nutrient characteristics were determined for 188 sclerophyll shrubland species from semi-arid Western Australia (35 % of regional floristic diversity) to determine the degree to which they were driven by functional traits. Additionally, seeds of 175 species were broadcast among different surface cover treatments in a dryland post-mining ecological restoration trial, to determine whether seed mass, seed nutrient concentration, or functional traits were informative at predicting seed-to-seedling transition. Results Examined functional traits explained 48 % of variation in seed mass and nutrient characteristics. Greatest effect sizes included embryo type for seed mass, and nutrient-acquisition strategy for the concentration and ratios of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium. Seed-to-seedling transition was most significantly influenced by functional traits including nutrient-acquisition strategy, embryo type, dispersal syndrome, growth form, and life history, as well as increasing seed potassium concentration which may offer a nutritional advantage for germination and establishment on nutrient-poor substrates. Conclusion This study helps bridge the science-practice gap in seed-based restoration, laying the foundations for evidence-based approaches to determining most effective use of limited seed resources. Seed- and species-trait filters should be applied when selecting species for restoration seed mixtures, improving cost-efficiency and ethical seed use by omitting species unlikely favoured on a given restoration substrate prior to seeding.

M.; Tausz, Michael			Crop rotation options for dryland agriculture: An assessment of grain yield response in cool-season grain legumes and canola to variation in rainfall totals	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Crop production in dryland systems is mainly dependent on water availability from rainfall which is highly variable between years and locations. We employed the widely used boundary-line analysis, with an existing industry dataset from across the Australian dryland cropping regions, to investigate the relative sensitivity of grain yield in canola (Brassica napus L.), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), faba bean (Vicia faba L), field pea (Pisum sativum L.), lentil (Lens culinaris L.), and narrow-leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) to variation in rainfall totals. Chickpea had the lowest non-productive water use, was more responsive to water supply, and reached its maximum yield at a lower water supply than the other species. In contrast canola had the highest non-productive water use, was less responsive to water supply, and reached its maximum yield at a higher water supply than the other species. These results suggest that chickpea offers the most stable outcome, and canola the greatest variation, in response to the variability in rainfall totals between years and locations.

Plastic sheet mulching has improved wheat grain yield in under dryland agriculture, but its impact on grain quality, particularly grain zinc (Zn) concen-tration is not well known. Seven-site field experiments were conducted during 2014-2016 on drylands of three provinces in the Loess Plateau of China to examine the effect of plastic sheet mulching on wheat grain Zn concentration under different N applications. A split-plot design was adopted with the two main plots (no mulching and plastic sheet mulching) and the subplots with different N application rate. Measurements of Zn uptake, Zn remobilization, Zn distribution to the grain and bioavailability were made, together with biomass, yield and yield components. Study found plastic sheet mulching reduced the grain Zn concentration, and increased the molar ratio of P/Zn, decreasing the Zn bioavailability. Plastic sheet mulching also increased the aboveground Zn accumulation at anthesis by 14.4 %, the straw Zn accumulation at maturity by 14.8 % and the Zn remobilization to the grain by14.2 % but did not affect the availability of soil Zn. For each 100 kg N ha-1 applied under plastic sheet mulching, the grain Zn concentration, the Zn requirement, the aboveground Zn accumulation and remobilization to the grain increased by 3.6 mg kg-1, 2.8 g Mg-1, 6.6 g ha-1 and 3.8 g ha-1, respectively. Aboveground Zn accumulation at maturity and post-anthesis Zn uptake varied with N rates in a linear-plus-plateau model. The reduction in post-anthesis Zn uptake and Zn harvest index were the factors leading to the decrease in grain Zn concentration under plastic sheet mulching. Consequently, under plastic sheet mulching, a rational N fertilizer strategy should be considered to improve the grain Zn concentration in wheat grown in dryland.																			0378-4290	1872-6852				NOV 1	2022	288								108681	10.1016/j.fcr.2022.108681	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2022.108681		SEP 2022											WOS:000867383600001

It is well known that pedogenic carbonate is less soluble than evaporate salts and commonly forms in natural drylands. However, few studies have evaluated how irrigation loads dissolved calcium and bicarbonate to agricultural fields, accelerating formation rates of secondary calcite and simultaneously releasing abiotic CO2 to the atmosphere. This study reports one of the first geochemical and isotopic studies of such "anthropogenic" pedogenic carbonates and CO2 from irrigated drylands of southwestern United States. A pecan orchard and an alfalfa field, where flood-irrigation using the Rio Grande river is a common practice, were compared to a nearby natural dryland site. Strontium and carbon isotope ratios show that bulk pedogenic carbonates in irrigated soils at the pecan orchard primarily formed due to flood-irrigation, and that approximately 20-50% of soil CO2 in these irrigated soils is calcite-derived abiotic CO2 instead of soil-respired or atmospheric origins. Multiple variables that control the salt buildup in this region are identified and impact the crop production and soil sustainability regionally and globally. Irrigation intensity and water chemistry (irrigation water quantity and quality) dictate salt loading, and soil texture governs water infiltration and salt leaching. In the study area, agricultural soils have accumulated up to 10 wt% of calcite after just about 100 years of cultivation. These rates will likely increase in the future due to the combined effects of climate variability (reduced rainfall and more intense evaporation), use of more brackish groundwater for irrigation, and reduced porosity in soils. The enhanced accumulation rates of pedogenic carbonate are accompanied by release of large amounts of abiotic CO2 from irrigated drylands to atmosphere. Extensive field studies and modelling approaches are needed to further quantify these effluxes at local, regional and global scales.

Temporal changes in soil function in a wooded dryland following simulated disturbance by a vertebrate engineer	CATENA												An inherent feature of arid and semiarid environments (drylands) is the importance of landscape heterogeneity in driving soil and ecological processes. Soil disturbance by organisms is an important, but often overlooked, driver of patchiness, but little is known about the temporal changes in soil and ecological processes following disturbance. We used artificial depressions, designed to mimic the foraging pits of the vertebrate marsupial, the Short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), to examine temporal changes in soil labile carbon, decomposition, litter capture, and plant germination and survival, over an 18 month period. Foraging pits had a half-life of about 7 months, and trapped seven-times more litter than an equivalent area on the soil surface. Larger pits tended to trap more litter than smaller pits. Foraging pits trapped six-times more seed abundance and three-times more richness than the surface. Eighteen months after disturbance, litter decomposition was 30% greater in the pits, and labile carbon concentrations were 8% greater (622 mg kg(-1)) than the original undisturbed soils (578 mg kg(-1)). Taken together, we provide strong evidence that foraging by native animals is an important mechanism for driving spatial heterogeneity in dryland soils. Our results also suggest that simulating the activities of short-beaked echidnas may provide a mechanism for rehabilitating degraded soils.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				MAY	2021	200								105166	10.1016/j.catena.2021.105166	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.105166													WOS:000620777400028

The aerobiome is known to contain microbes, including pathogens, as well as debris or small-sized propagules from plants and animals, but its variability and composition has not been studied comprehensibly. To gain a dynamic insight into the aerobiome existing over a mixed-use dryland setting, we conducted a biologically comprehensive, year-long survey of its composition and dynamics for particles less than 10 mu m in diameter based on quantitative analyses of DNA content coupled to genomic sequencing. Airborne biological loads were more dependent on seasonal events than on meteorological conditions and only weakly correlated with dust loads. Core aerobiome species could be understood as a mixture of high elevation (e.g. Microbacteriaceae, Micrococcaceae, Deinococci), and local plant and soil sources (e.g. Sphingomonas, Streptomyces, Acinetobacter). Despite the mixed used of the land surrounding the sampling site, taxa that contributed to high load events were largely traceable to proximal agricultural practices like cotton and livestock farming. This included not only the predominance of specific crop plant signals over those of native vegetation, but also that of their pathogens (bacterial, viral and eukaryotic). Faecal bacterial loads were also seasonally important, possibly sourced in intensive animal husbandry or manure fertilization activity, and this microbial load was enriched in tetracycline resistance genes. The presence of the native opportunistic pathogen, Coccidioides spp., by contrast, was detected only with highly sensitive techniques, and only rarely. We conclude that agricultural activity exerts a much stronger influence that the native vegetation as a mass loss factor to the land system and as an input to dryland aerobiomes, including in the dispersal of plant, animal and human pathogens and their genetic resistance characteristics.

Richard) under changing climate: implications for future dryland ecosystem restoration	HELIYON												Bamboo is the world's most widely exploited plant resource, with significant socio-economic and cultural values. In most parts of Africa, the population is in jeopardy due to the high pressure from human and natural forces. Of these, Oxytenanthera abyssinica (A. Richard) is among the threatened bamboo species. Furthermore, the effect of climate change on the distribution of bamboo has not yet been adequately studied. Therefore, this study aims to model and map the current and future distribution of O. abyssinica in Africa under four representative concentration pathways (RCPs), such as RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5. The future projections were done for the years 2050 and 2070 using SDM ensemble approaches. To model the current and future distribution of O. abyssinica in Africa, 737 presence data were collected from various sources. For this study, a total of eight (8) temperature and precipitation-related variables were used as inputs to the Species Distribution Model (SDM). Finally, the model performance was assessed based on the area under the curve (AUC) and true skills statistics (TSS) measures of statistics. Our results showed an upsurge in the distribution of O. abyssinica across the study area for the low and moderate suitability classes for the climatic conditions considered in this study. However, a steady shrinkage in the habitat was found for the higher suitability classes. The model indicated climatic-related factors such as precipitation during the cold and warm quarters (57.8%), followed by mean temperature during the coldest quarter, isothermality (41.9%) and topographic factors such as elevation and slope (31.6%) were identified as the main limiting factors for the growth of O. abyssinica. Precipitation and temperature during the dry period, on the other hand, had the least impact on the growth of O. abyssinica. Except for RCP2.6, the majority of south-western African countries and the Sahel region remain the most climatically stable ecosystems for O. abyssinica growth under the three climatic scenarios RCP45, RCP6 and RCP8.5. Our results revealed a steady increase in the future suitable habitat for O. abyssinica all over the continent under the considered climatic scenarios. Therefore, to support the future restoration of dryland ecosystems, countries should scheme a restoration policy that allows the sustainable utilization of O. abyssinica tree species. The future policy direction for biodiversity conservation and management should encourage the use of O. abyssinica as a major plant species for improving the livelihoods of people living in dryland areas.						weldemariam, Elias cherenet/0000-0001-5335-2120														2405-8440				AUG	2022	8	8							e10393	10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10393	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10393		AUG 2022						36090205					WOS:000863089400008

Performance of the ecosystem demography model (EDv2.2) in simulating gross primary production capacity and activity in a dryland study area	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Dryland ecosystems play an important role in the global carbon cycle, including regulating the inter-annual global carbon sink. Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are essential tools that can help us better understand carbon cycling in different ecosystems. Currently, there is limited knowledge of the performance of these models in drylands partly due to characterizing the heterogeneity of the vegetation and hydrometeorological conditions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of a DGVM for drylands to facilitate improved understanding of gross primary production (GPP) as one of the important components of the carbon cycle. We performed a sensitivity analysis and calibrated the Ecosystem Demography (EDv2.2) DGVM to simulate GPP in a dryland watershed (Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, Idaho) in the western US for the years 2000-2017. GPP capacity and activity were investigated by comparing model simulations with GPP estimated from eddy covariance data (available from 2015-2017) and remote sensing products (2000-2017). Our results show good performance of EDv2.2 at daily timesteps (RMSE approximate to 0.38 [kgC /m(2)/year]) between simulated and measured GPP in lower elevations of the watershed. Moreover, remote sensing analysis show that EDv2.2 captures the long-term trends in this ecosystem and performs relatively well in capturing phenometrics (start/ end of the season). The performance of the model degrades in more productive sites with greater GPP (located at higher elevations in the watershed). To improve model performance, future studies will need to introduce additional plant functional types for drylands such as our study area, and modify plant processes (e.g., plant hydraulics and phenology) in the model.

Integrated Effects of Mulching Treatment and Nitrogen Fertilization on Cotton Performance under Dryland Agriculture	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS												Crop production in arid regions is characterized with high temperature, drought and salinity which decrease water and nutrient use efficiency. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of wheat residue mulch in relation to N fertilizer application rates for cotton productivity under dryland condition of Uzbekistan. Main plots were control of no mulch addition and a 5 t ha(-1) mulch treatment. These plots were split into 5 N rate plots of 0, 70, 140, 210 or 280 kg of N ha(-1). The results showed that mulching pattern decreased soil temperature by 0.7-1.5 degrees C as compared to conventional treatment (CT), regardless of N fertilization rates. The soil water storage increased by 41.8, 17.3, 48.0 mm in the flowering, boll formation and ripening stages of cotton, respectively under mulching treatment. Soil available N concentration and nutrients uptake by plants consistently increased with the increase of N fertilization rates with positive correlations. At flowering period, the plant height, chlorophyll content, stem diameter, and a number of fruit branches in plants were higher by 32.3%, 46.8%, 26.7% and 55.3%, respectively at 210 kg N ha(-1) under mulching treatment as compared to the non-fertilized control. The highest cotton yield was obtained at 210 kg N ha(-1) application under mulching treatment. The correlation difference between mulch and N application rates was higher (R-2 = 0.97) than the difference in CTs and N application rates (R-2 = 0.89). This study showed that mulching had a greater impact to preserve nutrients and water resources in the soil, thereby improved cotton growth and yield.

Modelling and measurement of water productivity and total evaporation in a dryland soybean crop	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Simpler crop models simulating evaporation are needed to provide information to farmers, policy makers and decision makers on how to maximise crop yield responses to water. This is becoming important as the frequency and severity of droughts in South Africa is increasing. In this regard, prediction of yield, determination of water productivity and total evaporation (ET) are increasingly becoming essential in water resource management. The overall objective of the study was to compare the FAO AquaCrop daily model output of ET to the residual ET for non-stressed dryland soybean in a sub-humid climate. Energy balance residual ET estimates using an eddy covariance (EC) system and modelled ET using AquaCrop obtained from Glycine max (L.) Merrill grown in the midlands of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa during the 2012/13 growing season are compared. The modelled and observed yield showed good agreement, while the residual ET was 21.6% less than the modelled. The energy balance closure computed using the daily sums of sensible heat and latent energy fluxes against daily available energy flux for unstable atmospheric conditions was 0.77. A closure of 0.99 was achieved when the EC latent energy flux was replaced with residual latent energy flux. A good fit between the modelled and observed percentage green canopy cover was observed (slope = 0.86, intercept = 15.46%, root mean square error = 10.50% and R-2 = 0.83). Season-long daily residual ET values were consistently low for most of the growth stages compared to the modelled, except for the maturity stage. However, the residual ET comparisons with the AquaCrop model improved after gap-filling was applied to discarded data and for when the EC system failed.

Geomorphic change and biogeomorphic feedbacks in a dryland river: The Little Colorado River, Arizona, USA	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The Little Colorado River in Arizona, United States, has undergone substantial geomorphic change since the late 1800s and early 1900s, consisting of sediment accumulation following an earlier period of likely widespread sediment evacuation. We analyzed hydrologic and geomorphic data at different spatial and temporal scales to determine the primary mechanisms responsible for these changes, and to provide context for periods of sediment evacuation and accumulation in other rivers. Peak-flow magnitude has progressively declined since the 1920s despite the occurrence of four alternating periods of high and low total annual flow. Largely coincident with this hydrologic change, the channel has narrowed between 72% and 88% in some reaches since the 1930s, with increases in sinuosity in wide alluvial valleys causing similar to 21 %-32 % reductions in channel slope. Dense stands of vegetation colonized, and thus stabilized, the newly deposited floodplains. Although large, long-duration floods caused some channel widening, these floods have been too infrequent to offset the progressive narrowing. Channel narrowing, increases in sinuosity, decreases in slope, and increases in vegetative roughness appear to have caused biogeomorphic feedbacks, thereby exacerbating sediment deposition, disrupting flood conveyance, and contributing to decreases in peak-flow magnitude and in sediment transport. The progressive increase in water development in parts of the basin has also likely contributed to progressive declines in peak flow. These results show that biogeomorphic feedback processes combined with human water development may be as important as, if not more important than, changes in climate in driving hydrologic, geomorphic, and sediment-load change in dryland river environments.																			0016-7606	1943-2674				NOV-DEC	2019	131	11-12					1920	1942		10.1130/B35047.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B35047.1													WOS:000493796300010

Intercropping-Towards an Understanding of the Productivity and Profitability of Dryland Crop Mixtures in Southern Australia	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Intercropping using mixtures of dryland crop species for grain or seed production was investigated in southern Australia across a range of rainfall zones over three years. The objective was to understand the productivity and profitability of intercropping in extensive, high-input grain cropping systems. Previous research has shown large productivity benefits of mixtures; however, few farmers practice intercropping in Australia, and an analysis of profitability is needed to support future potential adoption. Experimental results showed strong mixture responses (in terms of yield, value and land equivalence), but not all were profitable compared to an equivalent share of monoculture crops (as measured by gross margins). The most promising mixtures were those containing high-value crops (canola) and legumes (field pea or faba bean) at the wetter sites where the additional gross margin over equivalent monoculture crops ranged from $12/ha to $576/ha. Mixtures containing highly competitive crops (wheat or barley) were generally unprofitable. Mixtures involving cereals were doubly disadvantaged by the aggressiveness of these lower-value crops in the mixtures we examined and the high grain separation costs post-harvest. Cost reduction in mixture systems involving high-value crops that are synergistic (grain legumes) should provide enduring opportunities for intercropping in southern Australia.

Biological soil crusts, a common feature of dryland ecosystems, are under extensive exploration for their potential to restore the stability and fertility of degraded soils through the development of inoculants. However, stressful abiotic conditions often result in the failure of inoculation-based restoration in the field and may hinder the long-term success of biocrust restoration efforts. Taking an assisted migration approach, we cultivated biocrust inocula sourced from multiple hot-adapted sites (Mojave and Sonoran Deserts) in an outdoor facility at a cool desert site (Colorado Plateau). In addition to cultivating inoculum from each site, we created an inoculum mixture of biocrust from the Mojave Desert, Sonoran Desert, and Colorado Plateau. We then applied two habitat amelioration treatments to the cultivation site (growth substrate and shading) to enhance soil stability and water availability and reduce UV stress. Using marker gene sequencing, we found that the cultivated mixed inoculum comprised both local- and hot-adapted cyanobacteria at the end of cultivation but had similar cyanobacterial richness as each unmixed inoculum. All cultivated inocula had more cyanobacterial 16S rRNA gene copies and higher cyanobacterial richness when cultivated with a growth substrate and shade. Our work shows that it is possible to field cultivate biocrust inocula sourced from different deserts, but that community composition shifts toward that of the cultivation site unless habitat amelioration is employed. Future assessments of the function of a mixed inoculum in restoration and its resilience in the face of abiotic stressors are needed to determine the relative benefit of assisted migration compared to the challenges and risks of this approach.

Long-term agro-management strategies shape soil bacterial community structure in dryland wheat systems	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Soil microbes play a crucial role in soil organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling and are influenced by management practices. Therefore, quantifying the impacts of various agricultural management practices on soil microbiomes and their activity is crucial for making informed management decisions. This study aimed to assess the impact of various management systems on soil bacterial abundance and diversity, soil enzyme activities and carbon mineralization potential in wheat-based systems. To accomplish this, soil samples from 0 to 15 cm depth were collected from ongoing long-term field trials in eastern Oregon region under wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow (WF), WF with different tillage (WT), wheat-pea (Pisum sativum L.) (WP), WF under different crop residue management (CR) and natural undisturbed/unmanaged grassland pasture (GP). These trials consisted of an array of treatments like tillage intensities, nitrogen rates, organic amendments, and seasonal residue burning. This study was a part of the Soil Health Institute's North American Project to Evaluate Soil Health measurements (NAPESHM). Bacterial community structure was determined using amplicon sequencing of the V4 region of 16SrRNA genes and followed the protocols of the Earth Microbiome Project. In addition, extracellular enzyme activities, and carbon mineralization potential (1d-CO2) were measured. Among different trials, 1d-CO2 in WT, WP, and CR studies averaged 53%, 51% and 87% lower than GP systems, respectively. Enzyme activities were significantly greater in GP compared to the other managements and followed similar trend as respiration. We observed higher evenness in GP and higher richness in spring residue burning treatment of CR study. Our results indicated that species evenness is perhaps a better indicator of soil health in comparison to other indices in dryland wheat systems.																			2045-2322					AUG 25	2023	13	1							13929	10.1038/s41598-023-41216-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-41216-z								37626146					WOS:001076403600053

There is global interest in using this approach to combat land degradation. Nevertheless, in order to use this biotechnology on a large scale, researchers must explore technologies that are simple and efficient to implement. To achieve this aim, we tested the effects of different covers to control dust and stabilize sand surfaces measures-that is, nonwoven fabric, dust-proof net, and sun-shading net-on colonization and development of artificial cyanobacteria crusts on the southeast edge of the Tengger Desert in Northern China. After 80 days, cyanobacteria crusts occurred in all inoculated soils. The best results occurred when using fresh cyanobacteria were covered with two-layer nonwoven fabric and one-layer sun-shading net; this treatment resulted in 50.0% biocrust cover, 2.88 mm biocrust thickness, 19.21 mu g cm(2)chlorophyll a concentration, 79.05 mu g cm(2)total carbohydrate content, and 10.00 m s(-1)threshold friction velocity, which is significantly higher than sand (3.70 m s(-1)). The results suggest that covering with nets can accelerate development of artificial cyanobacteria crusts, because covers improve micro-environments and remove barriers limiting biocrust colonization. This study describes a potential approach to reconstruct or recover biocrusts, and to restore degraded land in dryland ecosystems.

Consequently, many attempts have been made to study these patterns. However, most studies focus on data from species in temperate forests to the neglect of data from desert species adapted to arid conditions. We hypothesize that different life history strategies drive or at least participate in different plant biomass allocation patterns, as, for example, the life history differences between desert ephemeral and shrub species. We tested this hypothesis using field data gathered directly from the entire desert vegetation in Northwestern China. When the data from each of the two species groups are pooled, ephemeral and shrub species manifest different scaling relationships between above- and belowground biomass, unlike the isometric scaling relationships typically reported for forest tree species. The observed scaling relationships are sensitive to water stress and temperature gradients. The scaling exponents numerically decrease with increasing drought stress, and relatively more biomass is allocated to shoot growth in ephemeral species (presumably to rapidly complete their life history). In the case of shrubs, the numerical value of the scaling exponent is insensitive to rainfall, presumably because these species allocate more biomass to root growth to access belowground water. However, the scaling exponent is significantly sensitive to temperature, which also regulates root growth. Moreover, for the two species groups, root-shoot ratios are jointly regulated by precipitation and temperature. The different biomass allocation patterns appear to result from different life histories that maximize either competition among neighboring plants, or escaping damage from drought and low temperatures. These findings show how overall body size and life histories jointly regulate biomass allocation patterns under different extreme conditions and provide insights into estimating the dry carbon content in dryland ecosystems.

Soil samples were collected at five depths from plots in newly established (four months) dryland lucerne (Medicago sativa) pasture. Preceding this establishment, the plots were either under Saia oats (Avena strigose) cover crop, or no cover crop (managed with herbicides). Variables studied were soil aggregate stability, active carbon (KMnO4 oxidation), Solvita (R) nitrogen and carbon, protozoa (Most Probable Number) and carbon utilisation (Biolog Ecoplates (TM)). Principal component analysis (PCA) clearly showed associations between variables and the cover crop x depth treatments (two cover crop treatments - with and without cover crop), and five depth treatments (0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-20 and 20-30 cm). The PCA explained 72.9% of the total variation with the first three components (F1, F2 and F3). Protozoa separated clearly from the other variables. Discriminant analysis showed three distinct groups, namely 0-5 cm depth in both treatments, 5-10 cm depth with cover crop, while all others were in group 3. From these preliminary results it is clear that there are definitely differences in the effect of either a cover crop or no cover crop on some aspects of soil ecology.

We document a potential recovery of the dried salt-lake, Lop Nur called "the Sea of Death" which is located at the terminus of the largest inland basin in China, the Tarim River Basin. The changes and relationship of surface water with climate parameters and groundwater in the basin over the last 30 years are analyzed, by using satellite remote sensing and land data assimilation products. We find that with increased surface water in the basin, the groundwater level in Lop Nur began to show an obvious positive response in 2015; and the rate of decline of the groundwater level is slowing down. We argue that after a balance is achieved between regional groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration, the Lop Nur ecosystem will gradually recover. This study shows an encouraging case for the protection and restoration of degraded lakes in dryland regions around the world.

It is thus important to elucidate the interactive impacts of water and fertilizer management on AM fungi for sustainable agriculture. Our study investigated the effects of irrigation (wellwatered vs. drought) and fertilization (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and NP) on AM fungi in soil and roots of maize (Zea mays L.) across three consecutive growth phases (jointing, tasseling, and mature). Drought significantly decreased AM fungal extra-radical hyphal density and root colonization rate at the tasseling and mature phases, respectively. Nitrogen and NP fertilization exerted a negative effect on AM fungal spore density under drought at the mature phase. Drought decreased AM fungal richness in soil and roots at the jointing and mature phases, respectively. AM fungal community composition in soil and roots was significantly different between the jointing phase and the tasseling and mature phases. AM fungal community composition was influenced by fertilization at the tasseling phase in soil, but by irrigation at the jointing and tasseling phases in roots. Our findings highlight the differential response of AM fungi in soil and roots to drought and fertilization during the various phases of maize development in this dryland agroecosystem.

In the present study, 15 barley lines along with three local control cultivars under dryland conditions in six cold locations of Iran during three consecutive years (2013-2016) were evaluated. The results showed that the genotype-by-environment interaction is highly significant. The ratios between the sums of squares of G, GE and IPCA1 indicated that the AMMI model is suitable for data analysis. Also, combining AMMI model with BLUP technique and using WAASB index was promising and the results of both were in agreement. With the AMMI1 model, three mega-environments were determined, and the locations of Maragheh, Qamlu and Zanjan were located in the same mega-environment every three years. Finally, it was concluded that the second control cultivar was the most desirable genotype for most environments. Genotypes 16, 15 and 12 with high yield and optimal stability have the ability to be used as new potential genetic resources for improving and stabilizing grain yield in barley breeding programs for cold rainfed conditions. Genotypes 4, 5, and 6 should only be used in narrow adaptation to restricted environments. On the other hand, rainfall in November and January is important for proper seedling establishment, and rainfall in April and May is important for pollination and grain filling period.

Rhombic and hexagonal pattern formation in 2D hyperbolic reaction-transport systems in the context of dryland ecology	PHYSICA D-NONLINEAR PHENOMENA												In this paper the formation of rhombic and hexagonal Turing patterns in bidimensional hyperbolic reaction-transport systems is addressed in the context of dryland ecology. To this aim, exploiting the guidelines of the Extended Thermodynamics Theory, a hyperbolic extension of the classical modified Klausmeier vegetation model for flat arid environments is here proposed. This framework accounts explicitly for the inertial effects associated with the involved species and allows a more suitable description of transient dynamics between a spatially-homogeneous steady-state towards a patterned configuration. To characterize the emerging Turing patterns, linear stability analysis on the uniform steady-states is firstly addressed. Then, to determine the Stuart-Landau equations ruling the time evolution of the pattern amplitudes close to onset, multiple-scale weakly nonlinear analysis is performed for the two abovementioned geometries. Finally, to validate the analytical predictions as well as to provide more insights into the spatio-temporal evolution of the resulting pattern in both transient and stationary regimes, numerical simulations have been also performed. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

An occasional tillage is proposed to alleviate these, but only limited information is available on the effect of a single or occasional tillage on crop yield in a no-till wheat grain-sorghum-fallow (WSF) rotation. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of a single tillage to a 10-cm depth of a long-term (>6 yr) continuous no-till WSF system on grain yield, soil water, and water use of grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) for up to 3 yr after the single tillage operation. This research was conducted at Garden City and Tribune, KS. The three tillage treatments were a single tillage in May or June during fallow (June tillage), a single tillage after wheat harvest (July tillage), and a complete NT system. Grain yield of sorghum varied from average of 3.40 Mg ha(-1) at Garden City in 2014 to 8.04 Mg ha(-1) at Tribune in 2016. Grain yield of winter wheat varied from average of 0.47 Mg ha(-1) at Garden City in 2014 to 5.21 Mg ha(-1) at Tribune in 2016. There was no significant effect from a single tillage (June tillage or July tillage) on crop yield, yield components, biomass, available soil water (ASW), and water use compared with continuous no-till. Therefore, we have concluded that a single tillage of a long-term no-till dryland WSF system can be done without affecting crop performance.

However, changes in vegetation cover and spatial pattern are often linked, making it difficult to disentangle and assess their independent hydro-geomorphologic roles. We used synthetic sponges placed on the soil surface to mimic the aboveground structure of vegetation patches, and manipulated patch cover and pattern as well as the sink capacity of the patches on a set of 24 (2 x 1 m) runoff plots. Combining natural-rainfall and simulated-rainfall experiments, we aimed to test that (1) both vegetation cover and pattern independently control runoff and sediment yield; (2) for any given cover, coarsening the vegetation pattern entails increasing runoff and sediment yield; and (3) pattern effect is mostly exerted by modulating the source-sink dynamics of the system. We found that increasing either patch cover or patch density decreased runoff and sediment yields from natural rainfalls, yet the effect of patch density largely disappeared when the effect of the co-varying patch cover was removed. Simulated-rainfall experiments on plots with equal mediumlow patch cover showed however that coarser patterns (lower patch density; higher patch size) increased runoff coefficients and reduced time to runoff as compared with finer patterns. The effect of patch density was particularly clear when the sink function of vegetation patches was also mimicked. Rainfall interception and direct soil protection proved to be critical mechanisms underlying the effects of patch cover, yet they barely contributed to the effects of patch pattern. The control of overland flow by patch pattern was exerted through changes in the level of runoff disruption. However, physical obstructions to runoff hardly reduced runoff unless coupled to mimicked soil sinks. Overall this work demonstrates the independent effects of patch cover and pattern on the hydro-geomorphologic functioning of patchy landscapes, with patch cover being the primary hydrologic control factor and patch pattern exhibiting its full potential for low and medium low patch cover values. Our findings provide useful information for modelling and understanding dryland vegetation dynamics, and for designing management and restoration measures that take into account the critical role played by sourcesink dynamics and hydrological connectivity in dryland landscapes.

Multi-site evaluation of plastic film mulch and nitrogen fertilization for wheat grain yield, protein content and its components in semiarid areas of China	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												High crop yield and high quality are the primarily targets in intensive crop production. Although the plastic film mulch (PFM) approach has been well established for high-yielding wheat production in dryland, effects of PFM on wheat grain quality is still poorly understood. Therefore, multi-site and fixed location field experiments were conducted to investigate effects of PFM on grain yield, protein content and its components content of dryland winter wheat in 2014-2016 in the Loess Plateau of China. Compared with no mulch (NM), PFM increased the grain yield, structural protein contents and the ratio of gliadin/glutenin by 634 kg ha(-1), 11.3%-30.8% and 15.1%, respectively, but reduced the total protein and its gluten contents by 7.8% and 3.4%-15.1%. Furthermore, PFM significantly increased the proportion of albumin, globulin and gliadin to total protein by 22.3%, 44.2% and 5.5%, respectively, but decreased the proportion of glutenin by 7.4%, compared to NM. The highest grain yield, albumin and glutenin content were attained when the critical N rates were 146 kg N ha(-1), 167 kg N ha(-1) and 100 kg N ha(-1), respectively. Moreover, for every 100 kg ha(-1) increase in N fertilizer, the globulin content increased by 0.11%, but the ratio of gliadin/glutenin decreased by 0.12%. In summary, PFM did not show any benefit for gluten, while precise N fertilizer management provided an opportunity for improving grain processing quality of dryland wheat. In order to tradeoff between grain yield and its processing quality, the optimal N application rate (146-167 kg N ha(-1)) should be considered under PFM. These findings suggest that optimal N management serves as a basis for further investigation and regulation of grain protein components of wheat under PFM in the semiarid area of China and similar cropping system around the world.

Understanding the relationship between vegetation greenness and productivity across dryland ecosystems through the integration of PhenoCam, satellite, and eddy covariance data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Drylands account for approximately 40% of the global land surface and play a dominant role in the trend and variability of terrestrial carbon uptake and storage. Gross ecosystem photosynthesis termed gross primary productivity (GPP) is a critical driver of terrestrial carbon uptake and remains challenging to be observed directly. Currently, vegetation indices that largely capture changes in greenness are the most commonly used datasets in satellite-based GPP modeling. However, there remains significant uncertainty in the spatiotemporal relationship between greenness indices and GPP, especially for relatively heterogeneous dryland ecosystems. In this paper, we compared vegetation greenness indices from PhenoCam and satellite (Landsat and MODIS) observations against GPP estimates from the eddy covariance technique, across three representative ecosystem types of the southwestern United States. We systematically evaluated the changes in the relationship between vegetation greenness indices and GPP: i) across spatial scales of canopy-level, 30-meter, and 500-meter resolution; and ii) across temporal scale of daily, 8-day, 16-day, and monthly resolution. We found that greenness-GPP relationships were independent of spatial scales as long as land cover type and composition remained relatively constant. We also found that the greenness-GPP relationships became stronger as the time interval increased, with the strongest relationships observed at the monthly resolution. We posit that the greenness-GPP relationship breaks down at short timescales because greenness changes more slowly than plant physiological function, which responds rapidly to changes in key biophysical drivers. These findings provide insights into the potential for and limitations of modeling GPP using remotely sensed greenness indices across dryland ecosystem types.

Impacts of tillage and nutrient management on soil porosity trends in dryland agriculture	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												In dryland Mediterranean semi-arid areas, the use of slurries and no-till are encouraged to reduce costs. This paper evaluates the effect of such practices in terms of morphological changes of the topsoil porosity. The experiment had seven fertilization strategies (five of them including pig slurries applied at cereal sowing or at tillering) combined with no-till or tillage by disc-harrowing at sowing. Soil was classified as a Typic Xerofluvent. Texture was silt loam. Pores in the apparent pore diameter (APD) intervals higher than >15 mu m and at intervals up to 400 mu m were studied with a micromorphological approach plus image analysis. Fifty-four undisturbed and surface soil samples (0.06 m deep) were analysed. Samples were collected in the third year after the establishment of tillage treatments and throughout the cereal growing season: just before tillage, at cereal tillering and at grain maturity. The incorporation of slurry at pre-sowing similar to 2 Mg ha(-1) of organic matter ha(-1)) enhanced porosity (>15 mu m) by 33% in the cropping season but mainly in the 200-400- mu m class. Similar behaviour was observed in plots without topdressing fertilization, when till was compared with no-till. Thus, the potential movement of water and nutrients due to bypass flow was increased. When slurries were only applied at cereal tillering, only the tillage treatment increased topsoil porosity at grain maturity in the 15-100-mu m class by 22% and, thus, increased those pores responsible for soil and water storage. Temporary changes in pore shape after tillage can be explained by microstructure collapse and compaction followed by a partial porosity recovery by faunal activity at grain maturity. Highlights Slurry at pre-sowing, combined with tillage, increases topsoil coarse pores Tillage increases mesoporosity at grain maturity regardless of the slurry fertilization strategy Pore shape changes after tillage are not further visible at grain maturity No-till tends to compact silty topsoils, creating platy structures later counteracted by fauna					Mateo-Marín, Noemí/JHT-4437-2023; Poch, Rosa M/O-2357-2014; Poch, Rosa M/AAD-9529-2019	Mateo-Marín, Noemí/0000-0002-1003-8294; Poch, Rosa M/0000-0001-8639-4204; Molina, Maria Gabriela/0000-0002-6773-0513													1351-0754	1365-2389				JAN	2022	73	1								10.1111/ejss.13139	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13139		JUL 2021											WOS:000678809400001
J	Siero, E				Siero, Eric			Resolving soil and surface water flux as drivers of pattern formation in Turing models of dryland vegetation: A unified approach	PHYSICA D-NONLINEAR PHENOMENA												Over the past two decades, multi-component dryland vegetation models have been successful in qualitatively reproducing the spatial vegetation patterns widely observed in nature. In the two-component (water, vegetation) Klausmeier model, water flow from bare to vegetated areas drives pattern formation. The more elaborate Rietkerk and Gilad three-component models make a distinction between soil and surface water. In this article the three models are approximated from within a unifying framework, with a focus on processes that drive pattern formation, in order to promote the understanding of similarities and differences between these models. Reduction from a model with a separate soil and surface water component, to a model with a single water component, preserves Turing instability in all but one of the cases studied.

The nonlinear structure of this model is more involved than other more conceptual models, such as the extended Klausmeier model, and the analysis a priori is more complicated. However, the present model has a strong advantage over these more conceptual models in that it can be more directly linked to ecological mechanisms and observations. Moreover, we find that the model exhibits a richness of analytically tractable patterns that exceeds that of Klausmeier-type models. Our study focuses on the 4-dimensional dynamical system associated with the reaction-diffusion model by considering traveling waves in 1 spatial dimension. We use the methods of geometric singular perturbation theory to establish the existence of a multitude of heteroclinic/homoclinic/periodic orbits that 'jump' between (normally hyperbolic) slow manifolds, representing various kinds of localized vegetation patterns. The basic 1-front invasion patterns and 2-front spot/gap patterns that form the starting point of our analysis have a direct ecological interpretation and appear naturally in simulations of the model. By exploiting the rich nonlinear structure of the model, we construct many multi-front patterns that are novel, both from the ecological and the mathematical point of view. In fact, we argue that these orbits/patterns are not specific for the model considered here, but will also occur in a much more general (singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion) setting. We conclude with a discussion of the ecological and mathematical implications of our findings. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Increased use of fallow can result in soil degradation and greater cropping system uncertainty. In view of that, a regional simulation study was planned to explore for different spring crop options that can fit in place of fallow in rotation with winter wheat.OBJECTIVE: The main goal of the study was to provide spring crop pre-plant yields and available soil water left after harvest of spring crop as forecasts at regional scales to compare fallow versus spring crop choices known here as flex-cropping.METHODS: Model simulations were conducted using CropSyst (Cropping System Simulation model) and were based on historic (1981-2010) and historic combined with recent year's weather identified as Dry/Average/Wet. Historic weather was joined with recent weather at different forecast dates (Dec. 1st, Jan. 1st, Feb. 1st, March 1st, and April 1st). Hence, weather until forecast dates consisted of recent and historic later on. To identify a suitable forecast date, regression analysis was conducted to compare yields of spring crops on different forecast dates with corresponding yields obtained on recent weather years. Regional simulations were run on identified forecasting date to forecast yields and available water left in the profile after harvest.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Regression analysis showed high correlation (R2) between yields obtained on forecast dates of Feb/March/April 1st with yields on recent years. Coefficient of variation (CV) was also lower for spring crops yields simulated on forecast dates of Feb/March/April 1st compared to Dec. 1st and Jan. 1st. Feb 1st was considered important to select as forecast date due to much variability in the spring crop planting across the region. Regional forecast maps of spring crop yields, their CV and available water are presented in the study. Spring pea was identified as flex-crop to intensify cropping systems in grain fallow. Spring canola and spring wheat were expected to have negative rotational impact, therefore were better options to diversify the systems in annual crop and annual crop transition areas. Keeping in mind the limitations of simulation models, this study highly recommends for validation field trials at different locations across iPNW.SIGNIFICANCE: Maps of predicted spring crop yields, their CVs and predicted available water after fallow will aid in decision making related to intensification and diversification of iPNW.

The basic information is collected from wheat farmers in the form of questionnaires in the crop year 2015-2016. The meteorology and crop data are gathered, respectively, from the Meteorological Organization and Ministry of Agriculture Jihad. The functional unit, research boundary and impact category are, respectively, considered to be "the production of 1 kg of wheat grains," "the farm gate," and "Global Warming Potential." Data were prepared and analyzed in Excel and SimaPro software. The global warming index is calculated to be, respectively, 1.22 and 0.72 equivalent kilograms of carbon dioxide for the production of 1 kg of irrigated and dryland wheat. Based on the results, electricity, and machinery (53% and 22%, respectively, in the irrigated wheat) and machinery, diesel fuel, and chemical fertilizer application (44%, 4%, and 4%, respectively, in the dry wheat) have the highest share in greenhouse gas emissions. The results indicate that improving the management of the optimal use of inputs and the increase of the area under cultivation can have a significant role in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

Deposited rocks can form a lithic niche for microorganisms in desert regions. Mineral weathering is a key process in soil formation and the importance of microbial-driven mineral weathering for nutrient extraction is increasingly accepted. Advances in geobiology provide insight into the interactions between microorganisms and minerals that play an important role in weathering processes. In this study, we present the examination of the microbial diversity in dryland rocks from the Tsauchab River banks in Namibia. We paired culture-independent 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing with culture-dependent (isolation of bacteria) techniques to assess the community structure and diversity patterns. Bacteria isolated from dryland rocks are typical of xeric environments and are described as being involved in rock weathering processes. For the first time, we extracted extra- and intracellular DNA from rocks to enhance our understanding of potentially rock-weathering microorganisms. We compared the microbial community structure in different rock types (limestone, quartz-rich sandstone and quartz-rich shale) with adjacent soils below the rocks. Our results indicate differences in the living lithic and sublithic microbial communities.

Economic and environmental performance of dryland wheat-based farming systems in a 1.5°C world	MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE												In 2015, the United Nations challenged the scientific community to evaluate development pathways consistent with the goal of limiting global average temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C. This study reports analysis that was carried out as part of a project responding to that challenge. Using recently developed methods for regional integrated assessment of agricultural systems, this study evaluates the economic and environmental performance of dryland farming systems in the United States of America (U.S). Pacific Northwest, a major wheat (Triticum aestivum) production region, under greenhouse gas mitigation and policy scenarios consistent with the 1.5 degrees C goal. A novel feature of this study is to combine bio-physical and economic models with site-specific life cycle analysis to evaluate both the economic performance of current and possible alternative farming systems. The analysis shows that these farming systems could be adapted through changes in management to reduce soil emissions of greenhouse gases and incorporation of new biofuel crops, and could be affected by changes in prices and costs of production associated with greenhouse gas mitigation policies. These changes could result in a win-win outcome for those farms in the Pacific Northwest region where site-specific conditions are suited to these adaptations, providing both higher farm incomes and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions reductions. A key implication for mitigation and adaptation strategies is the need to coordinate climate policy design and development of technologies needed to achieve policy goals.

Impacts of Vegetation on Dryland River Morphology: Insights From Spring-Fed Channel Reaches, Henry Mountains, Utah	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												A better understanding of how vegetation influences alluvial channels could improve (a) assessments of channel stability and flood risks, (b) applications of vegetation as a river management tool, and (c) predictions of channel responses to climate change and other human impacts. We take advantage of a natural field experiment in the semi-arid to arid Henry Mountains, Utah, USA: large spatial differences in bed and bank vegetation are found along some alluvial channels due to localized perennial springs caused by aquicludes in the underlying bedrock. Airborne LiDAR topography and flood modeling are used to constrain channel morphology, vegetation density, and flow velocity at different flood discharges for three spring-fed reaches along intermittently flowing streams. The spatial distribution of vegetation quantitatively influences both the magnitude and direction of channel adjustment. Reaches with abundant bed vegetation are significantly wider (by an average of approximate to 50%), with shallower flows and lower velocities, than reaches with little bed vegetation. Reaches with dense channel bank vegetation are approximate to 25% narrower and approximate to 25% deeper than sparsely vegetated reaches. We interpret that sediment grain size influences the spatial distribution of vegetation within spring reaches, but that bank vegetation may be more important than grain size for "threshold" width adjustments. Widths, depths, and velocities are fairly insensitive to whether local hydraulic roughness is parameterized in terms of local vegetation density or is assumed spatially constant, suggesting that the underlying "bare earth" topography of the channel bed and banks exerts more control on local flow than does local vegetation density in this landscape.

Treated with Cattle Manure at Different Plant Densities under Dryland Farming System	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL PLANTS AND BY-PRODUCTS-JMPB												The management of plant arrangement and organic fertilizer is an effective practice in agricultural systems particularly in dryland farming condition. The split plot experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of cattle manure and plant density on essential oil (EO) content, EO yield, photosynthesis contents, leaf nutrients, enzyme activities of Satureja mutica Fisch. & C.A.Mey. based on completely randomized block design (CRBD) with three replications during 2018 and 2019. The plants were treated with cattle manure (30 tones ha(-1)) under high plant density (HPD, 80000 plant ha(-1)), medium plant density (MPD, 40000 plant ha(-1)), and low plant density (LPD, 26666 plant ha(-1)) in dryland farming system. The results showed that the highest EO content (2.2%) and EO yield (10.9 kg ha(-1)) were observed in the second-year plants with manure application at HPD. Under both HPD and MPD, chlorophyll (Chl) a+b was greater compared to LPD. The higher concentrations of magnesium (Mg) and phosphorous (P) were observed in second-year plants treated with manure application at MPD in comparison with LPD/HPD. Compared to LPD, increased potassium (K) and calcium (Ca) contents were observed at HPD and MPD. The activity of antioxidant enzymes at LPD was significantly higher than other treatments. The use of cattle manure and HPD could increase EO production, but MPD is suggested in improving leaf nutrients of S. mutica.

Aridity drives spatiotemporal patterns of masting across the latitudinal range of a dryland conifer	ECOGRAPHY												Masting, or the synchronous and irregular production of seed crops, is controlled by environmental conditions and resource budgets. Increasing temperatures and shifting precipitation regimes may alter the frequency and magnitude of masting, especially in species that experience chronic resource stress. Yet the effects of a changing climate on seed production are unlikely to be uniform across populations, particularly those that span broad abiotic gradients. In this study, we assessed the spatiotemporal patterns of masting across the latitudinal distribution of a widely distributed dryland conifer species, pinon pine Pinus edulis. We quantified seed cone production from 2004 to 2017 using cone abscission scars in 187 trees from 28 sites along an 1100 km latitudinal gradient to investigate the spatiotemporal drivers of seed cone production and synchrony across populations. Populations from chronically hot and dry areas (greater climatic water deficits and less monsoonal precipitation) tended to have greater interannual variability in seed cone production and smaller crop sizes. Mast years generally followed years with low vapor pressure deficits and high precipitation during key periods of the reproductive process, but the strength of these relationships varied across the region. Populations that received greater monsoonal precipitation were less sensitive to late summer vapor pressure deficits during seed cone initiation yet more sensitive to spring vapor pressure deficits during pollination. Spatially correlated patterns of vapor pressure deficit better predicted synchrony in seed cone production than geographic distance, and these patterns were conserved at distances up to 500 km. These results demonstrate that aridity drives spatiotemporal variability in seed cone production. As a result, projected increases in aridity are likely to decrease the frequency and magnitude of masting in these dry forests and woodlands. Declines in seed production may compound climatic limitations to recruitment and impede tree regeneration, with cascading effects for numerous wildlife species.

We hypothesized that the N concentrations in foliar and nonfoliar organs affect the remobilization, vertical distribution, and accumulation on N in grain. A 2-yr field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of N input and mulching practice on N remobilization and N vertical distribution in the canopy of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The results showed that foliar organs had higher N concentration than nonfoliar organs in all treatments. Among the nonfoliar organs, the flag leaf sheath had the highest N concentration, followed by glumes and rachillae combination, while the stem had the lowest N concentration at anthesis and maturity. In the different internode segments of the stem, N concentrations decreased with grain filling, except for the exposed part of the peduncle. There was a top-to-down decline in N concentration within the canopy. Foliar organs contributed the most N to grain followed by the stem and the glumes and rachillae combination. The N286 treatment significantly improved N accumulation, remobilization, and vertical distribution in the canopy and N content in grain. Nitrogen concentration in the grain was positively correlated with the difference in N concentrations between apical and basal vegetative modules.

Host plants and the microbiota living in the rhizosphere are interdependent, mutually reinforced and mutually beneficial but the assembly, functions and microbial interactions of the host-associated microbiota are still unclear. 2. Herein, winter wheat was selected as a test plant to explore the assembly process of total bacteria from bulk soil (BS) and rhizosphere soil (RS), and phoD-harbouring bacteria in RS at a long-term (14 years) trial site. We also identified core microbes that are potentially relevant to soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling genes and soil biogeochemical properties, and investigated the relationships between soil variables, functional genes and wheat productivity. 3. The results showed that the microhabitat of the plant, rather than P fertilizer input, was the main factor affecting the microbial diversity, composition and co-occurrence networks. The BS bacterial community was driven by deterministic processes but the RS and phoD bacterial communities were dominated by stochastic processes. The influence of deterministic processes decreased with increasing soil nutrient content. A core microbial community consisted of 10 OTUs in different microhabitats and was significantly related to soil functional genes and properties.

In this study, eight released bread and durum wheat cultivars, differing in growth habit, were evaluated for grain yield and 15 agro-physiological traits under both conventional tillage (CT) and conservation agriculture (CA) systems using split-plot arrangements in randomized complete blocks design with three replications, in three cropping seasons (2017-2020) under rainfed conditions, at Sararood field station, Kermanshah, Iran. Cultivar, year and tillage-system main effects were significant (P < 0.01) and accounted for 1.5%, 57.8%, and 10.5% of the total variation in grain yield, respectively. The wheat cultivars performed better in conventional than conservation agriculture system with grain yield superiority varied from 4 to 35%, depending on amount and distribution pattern of precipitation over crop seasons. The best performing cultivar in conservation agriculture system was cv. Baran, winter bread wheat, while the best performing cultivar under conventional tillage was cv. Rijaw, facultative bread wheat. Cv. Sadra had the highest grain yield stability followed closely by cv. Rijaw. The positive relationships observed between grain yield and important agro-physiological traits, suggesting the efficiency of indirect selection of traits for improving grain yield under the two different tillage systems. The trait profile of wheat cultivars was strongly affected by year, depending on growth habit, and varied from one system to another. In conclusion, positive interaction of genotype and traits under two systems indicated that some traits (i.e., number of spike/m(-2), SPAD reading, normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI), days to heading, 1000-kernel weight and grain filling duration) were effective in genotype adaptation to a particular system. Based on the findings, the distribution pattern of precipitation during cropping season was among the major determinant factor in success of rainfed wheat productivity. The wheat genotypes also significantly interacted with different tillage systems, implying the need for specific adaptation to tillage systems and environments.

Forage yield and nutritive quality of summer-planted annual forages in semi-arid regions after irrigated wheat or in a dryland cropping rotation	APPLIED ANIMAL SCIENCE												Objectives: Two experiments evaluated (1) annual forages planted after wheat harvest with limited irrigation or (2) annual forage mixtures compared with monocultures in a dryland rotation in a semi-arid region. Material and Methods: In Exp. 1, sorghum sudangrass (SS), oats (OAT), and foxtail millet (FM) were planted on 2 dates (D1, D2) following irrigated wheat harvest in a split plot design. In Exp. 2, SS and FM were compared with forage mixtures containing SS or FM and soybeans and forage collards (SC), or cowpeas and forage collards (CC), in a randomized design. Results and Discussion: In Exp. 1, yr 1, SS had greater yield at D1 (P < 0.0001) than the OAT and FM, which did not differ (P > 0.81). The SS, OAT, and FM did not differ at D2 (P > 0.15). In yr 2, yield was greater (P < 0.01) at D1 than D2. The CP was greater for D2 than D1 (P < 0.0001) at fall harvest, before frost. In Exp. 2, yield was decreased when CC were added to SS and FM (P < 0.02). The mixtures had greater CP (P < 0.04) than the respective monocultures. Yield and digestibility were least expensive for SS compared with the mixtures. Implications and Applications: Early-planted annual forages in irrigated wheat stubble have the greatest yield and are acceptable standing winter forage. Annual forage mixtures planted in a dryland crop rotation were not as cost effective as monocultures. Annual forages can be used in semi-arid regions where perennial forage is limited.																			2590-2873	2590-2865				AUG	2019	35	4					371	378		10.15232/aas.2018-01828	http://dx.doi.org/10.15232/aas.2018-01828													WOS:000538173300002
J	Xiao, B; Ma, S; Hu, KL				Xiao, Bo; Ma, Shuang; Hu, Kelin			Moss biocrusts regulate surface soil thermal properties and generate buffering effects on soil temperature dynamics in dryland ecosystem	GEODERMA												Biocrusts are promising ecosystem engineers in dryland ecosystems, but their effects on soil temperature, which is the most important environmental factor of soil biological and biochemical processes, have not yet been well understood. In a semiarid ecosystem on the Chinese Loess Plateau, the thermal properties of moss-dominated biocrust layer and bare soil (upper 2 cm) were measured, and their correlations with the biocrust characteristics as well as soil properties (especially soil water content, theta) were analyzed. Afterwards, the soil temperature dynamics of the biocrust covered soil and bare soil were continuously recorded at 2, 6, and 10 cm depths during a year. From in-situ measurements in wet season, we found that the biocrusts increased surface soil heat capacity (C) by 10.3% (1.42 vs. 1.28 MJ m(-3) K-1), thermal conductivity (lambda) by 27.7% (0.69 vs. 0.54 W m(-1) K-1), and thermal diffusivity (alpha) by 27.9% (5.01 vs. 3.92 x 10(-7) m(2) s(-1)) as compared with the bare soil, through holding more soil water (theta of the biocrusts vs. bare soil = 0.06 vs. 0.03 cm(3) cm(-3)). However, in dry season (theta < 0.05 cm(3) cm(-3)) they decreased 33.4% of surface soil C (0.78 vs. 1.17 MJ m(-3) K-1), 54.9% of lambda (0.17 vs. 0.37 W m(-1) K-1), and 22.9% of a (2.32 vs. 3.01 x 10(-7) m(2) s(-1)) mostly by decreasing surface soil bulk density. Accordingly, the biocrusts decreased soil temperature by as much as 6.3-11.1 degrees C at 0-10 cm depth in wet season (summer), and they increased soil temperature by up to 1.3-3.7 degrees C in dry season (winter). More importantly, the diurnal range of soil temperature of the biocrust covered soil was sometimes as much as 6.8-9.4 degrees C lower than that of the bare soil at 0-10 cm depth. The decreasing or increasing effects of the biocrusts on soil temperature were exactly explained by the increased thermal properties of the biocrust layer in wet season or reduced thermal properties of the biocrust layer in dry season. We concluded that the biocrusts regulated surface soil thermal properties through increasing soil water holding capacity and decreasing soil bulk density; thus, they generated considerable buffering effects on soil temperature dynamics. In dryland ecosystem, such buffering effects of the biocrusts on soil temperature should be highly considered in various soil biological and biochemical processes.

In the Sahara Desert, palaeoclimate oscillations affected the extent of hyper-arid habitats, but it is unclear how these dynamics determined the evolution and distribution of local specialists. Herein, we assessed cryptic diversity, diversification patterns and spatial connectivity within a Sahara-widespread group of dryland-adapted lizards. Location Sahara-Sahel ecoregions. Taxon Acanthodactylus scutellatus species group. Methods Inter- and intraspecific phylogenetic structure, divergence times, spatial genetic patterns and cryptic diversity were assessed using nuclear and mitochondrial loci. The effects of topography and land cover on phylogeographic structure and diversity were tested with generalized linear models. Interspecific hybridization was evaluated using 11 microsatellites across the group's major sympatry zone, predicted based on ecological niche models. Results Species of Acanthodactylus scutellatus group exhibit Late Miocene origins, followed by extensive intraspecific divergence throughout the Pliocene. The northern Sahara worked as a major diversification hotspot, harbouring a patchwork of small-ranged, divergent lineages. These lineages are parapatric or sympatric and present concordant nuclear and mitochondrial differentiation, suggesting species status. Genetic connectivity increases in southern latitudes, with wide-ranging lineages spanning from the Red Sea to the Atlantic coast. Within these potential corridors, mountain outskirts and sand fields in the Sahara interior seemingly acted as origins for recent population expansions. Genetic diversity and connectivity are favoured by terrain roughness and soft-sand cover respectively. Three species inhabit the Atlantic Sahara sympatry zone without evidence of gene flow. Main conclusions Overlooked species-level diversity within a major specialist group of Sahara drylands exposes the recurrent knowledge shortfalls present in hyper-arid desert environments. Humidity and sandy habitat shifts triggered potential successions of population isolation and re-connectivity, which favoured cladogenesis in northern desert regions and population expansions across southern east-west corridors.

SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Soil labile C fractions have been proposed as promising soil health indicators, but they have not been related to extensive soil properties and crop yields. We evaluated the relationships among soil organic carbon (SOC), labile C fractions, 62 soil physical, chemical, biological, and biochemical properties, and mean crop yields in two long-term (14- and 36-yr-old) sites (Froid and Sidney, eastern Montana) under dryland farming. Soil C fractions were SOC, soil inorganic carbon (SIC), water-extractable carbon (WEC), KMnO4-extractable carbon (POXC), potential carbon mineralization (PCM), and microbially active carbon (MAC). Treatments were conventional till and no-till spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/barley (Hordeum vulgaris L.), pea (Pisum sativum L.), and fallow rotations without N fertilization in Froid and with and without N fertilization in Sidney. Carbon fractions were greater in no-till continuous cropping than till crop-fallow, with no effect of N fertilization at both sites. The principal component analysis showed that PCM was strongly associated with most soil physical, chemical, biological, and biochemical properties, followed by SOC, POXC, WEC, MAC, and SIC at both sites. More C fractions were related to soil properties in longer than shorter duration of the experiment. All C fractions, except SIC, were also related to mean crop yields across years. Although SOC was related to soil properties and crop yields, PCM may be used as a promising soil health indicator because of its greater sensitivity to management practices and better relationship to soil properties and crop yields than other labile C fractions.

Accessions under Dryland Conditions	LEGUME RESEARCH												Background: The research was conducted at the ICAR-CRIDA Hayatnagar Research Farm in Hyderabad, India. The plant material consisting of tamarind trees that were planted in 1998 with a 5 m spacing to improve the morphological and reproductive characteristics of elite genotypes as well as quality among the forty tamarind accessions maintained at the research farm. The experiment was started in 1998 and observations were taken over the fruiting season of 2020-2021 with forty tamarind accessions, the experiments were established in a randomized block design. The trees were identified for their consistent health and development. Methods: Biometric observations mainly average number of flowers per inflorescence, average number of inflorescence per Branch, average number of branches per tree, average fruit weight (g), average yield per plant (kg), fruit, pulp, seed weights as well as shell, fibre, fruit, number of normal seeds per pod as well as damaged number of seeds per pod were recorded and analyzed statistically. Result: Significant differences among the tamarind accessions evaluated, NZB(S), Hasanur #5, Salem 132, NTI-14 and SMG-3 recorded the highest values in all the growth, pod and yield characters. NZB(S) recorded the highest number of flowers per inflorescence (14.62) while Hasanur # 5 recorded the highest number of inflorescence per branch (13.87). In yield attributes, NZB(S) recorded the highest average yield per plant (kg) (15.72) followed by Hasanur #5 (15.09), Salem 132 (14.81) and NTI-14 (14.65). The results revealed that NZB(S) showed the highest mean performance in terms of growth, yield and quality characters. The best performing accessions are being multiplied through vegetative propagation methods for planting on large scale in different locations.																			0250-5371					SEP	2023	46	9					1179	1183		10.18805/LR-4810	http://dx.doi.org/10.18805/LR-4810													WOS:001092065800011

To identify important indicators of dryland degradation, we conducted a field survey of 46 drylands spanning an aridity gradient across the Tibetan Plateau. Our random forest model suggested that soil sand content was the most important predictor of variation in soil fertility (carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus). Most soil fertility showed a nonlinear and abrupt decline with increasing soil sand content, and displayed three sequential thresholds. First, soil organic carbon sharply decreased beyond a soil sand content threshold of 47%. Second, exceeding a subsequent threshold of 70%, the total nitrogen and light fraction carbon declined dramatically with increasing soil sand content. Finally, soil heavy fraction carbon, inorganic carbon, and total carbon were drastically reduced when the soil sand content exceeded 80%. The three soil fertility thresholds along the gradient of the soil sand content indicated a sequence of dryland degradation phases. Our findings provide an approach for detecting the severity of dryland degradation and suggest vulnerable areas of degradation on the Tibetan Plateau.																			1085-3278	1099-145X				JUL 15	2023	34	11					3272	3280		10.1002/ldr.4682	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4682		MAR 2023											WOS:000954745700001
J	Sagi, N; Zaguri, M; Hawlena, D				Sagi, Nevo; Zaguri, Moshe; Hawlena, Dror			Macro-detritivores Assist Resolving the Dryland Decomposition Conundrum by Engineering an Underworld Heaven for Decomposers	ECOSYSTEMS												Litter decomposition in most terrestrial ecosystems is regulated by moisture-dependent microorganism activity, among other things. Decomposition models typically underestimate rates of plant litter decomposition in drylands, suggesting the existence of additional drivers of decomposition. Attempts to reveal these drivers have predominantly focused on abiotic degradation agents, alternative moisture sources, and soil-litter mixing. The role of burrowing animals in promoting decomposition has received less attention despite greatly contributing to plant litter transfer from the harsh desert surface to the moister and nutrient-rich environment belowground. Our goal was to explore how macro-detritivore burrows affect plant litter mineralization dynamics. We introduced C-13-labeled litter belowground into (1) desert isopod (Hemilepistus reaumuri) burrows and (2) artificial burrows, and aboveground on top of (3) isopod fecal pellet mounds and (4) bare soil crust. We compared the litter mass loss between the four treatments and used cavity ring-down spectroscopy to reveal the in situ mineralization dynamics. No litter mineralization was evident during the dry summer months both above- and belowground. Following rain events, mineralization rates spiked in all four micro-environments, quickly diminishing aboveground while slowly waning belowground. Total litter mass loss was twofold higher below than aboveground and was significantly higher in isopod burrows compared to artificial burrows. Our findings demonstrate that burrowing macro-detritivores promote litter decomposition in deserts by transferring organic matter to their burrows where favorable climatic conditions and a nutrient-enriched environment foster microbial activity. Thus, attempts to resolve the dryland decomposition conundrum should not be limited to exploring factors that allow decomposition under harsh desert surface climatic conditions, but focus on the role that animals play in facilitating decomposer-friendly environments to which they translocate plant litter.

J	Schillinger, WF				Schillinger, William F.			Camelina: Long-term cropping systems research in a dry Mediterranean climate	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Camelina [Camelina saliva (L.) Crantz] is a short-season annual oilseed crop in the Brassicaceae family. Interest in camelina has increased substantially during the past 15 years because the oil is an excellent feedstock for producing low-carbon-emission biofuel and has a unique fatty acid profile as a potential edible oil. Camelina has been promoted as an alternative crop in low-precipitation dryland regions because of its low fertilizer requirement and drought tolerance. An 8-yr field experiment was conducted from 2010 to 2017 at the WSU Dryland Research Station near Lind, WA to compare a 3-yr winter wheat (WW)-spring camelina-summer fallow (SF) rotation with the traditional 2-yr WW-SF rotation. Annual crop-year (Sept. 1-Aug. 31) precipitation ranged from 193 to 375 mm and averaged 281 mm. Camelina seed yield ranged from 339 to 1175 kg/ha and averaged 643 kg/ha. Mean WW yield of 2692 kg/ha in the 3-yr rotation was significantly lower (p = 0.046) compared to 2862 kg/ha in the 2-yr rotation. Soil profile water was significantly lower (p < 0.001) after harvest of camelina compared to after WW harvest in the 2-yr rotation. This soil water reduction was consistently measured throughout the ensuing 13-month fallow cycle. There are no labeled in-crop broadleaf weed herbicides for camelina and populations of Russian thistle (Salsola tragus L.) and tumble mustard (Sisymbrium altissimum L) were higher in camelina than in WW. This was likely a factor in the deep extraction of soil water in the camelina plots to a depth of 180 cm. Data from this study suggest that, with current cultivars and management practices, camelina is not yet agronomically or economically stable or viable in a 3-yr WW-camelina-SF rotation in the low-precipitation (< 300 mm annual) rainfed cropping region of the Inland Pacific Northwest (PNW).

J	Vetter, T; Rieger, AK				Vetter, Thomas; Rieger, Anna-Katharina			Water harvesting as a key for understanding adapted ancient livelihoods in an arid environment - Approaches to dryland archaeology in the Eastern Marmarica (NW-Egypt)	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The Marmarica, an arid region in NW-Egypt between the Jebel el Akhdar to the west and the Nile Valley to the east, offers rich evidence for understanding the interlinkages of scarce natural resources, above all water and soil and their human utilization in antiquity. Analysing the natural hydrological regime depending on rainfall, soils and topography in the region and the man-made interventions lies at the heart of this landscape archaeological study. Integrating evidence from various disciplines (hydrology, geomorphology, soil science, archaeobiological methods, ceramic studies, evaluation of literary sources based on papyri) and from various periods (late 2nd millennium BCE to 7th century CE) allowed for the reconstruction of the ancient water management and the related life-strategies. An assessment of climatic conditions and morphological features of the Eastern Marmarica is provided, where wadis, alluvial fans, but also lateral wadi slopes and to a certain extent even parts of the vast tableland plains represent favourable geomorphological units for water harvesting and hence, agricultural production. Yet, a characteristic that sets the Marmarican systems apart from those in other arid regions are cultivated terrace systems (run-in areas) that are located on lower lateral valley slopes and even on the tableland plains. The results provide insights into the long-term responses of the inhabitants in antiquity to catchment hydrology by water harvesting and the effects of their interventions, the adapted livelihoods, regional specialization of rural production and intra- and interregional exchange of goods. However, new questions arose regarding i) the implications of the ancient water management strategy for the social organisation of the local people, ii) the destinations of locally produced pottery, iii) the habitational and land-use patterns before the Graeco-Roman period, iv) the role and range of climatic shifts, and v) reasons for the decline of the sophisticated runoff management.

Four treatments were evaluated: unplanted soil without (C0) or with (CN) N fertilization and planted maize without (P0) or with (PN) N fertilization. Soil surface fluxes and profile dynamics of CH4 at depths of 0-50 cm in situ were monitored. The CH4 concentrations decreased with increasing soil depth. Seasonal and vertical variations in CH4 diffusive fluxes varied with maize phenology. The CH4 fluxes in the 0-20 cm layers accounted for 48.9-57.5% of the total fluxes in the 0-50 cm layers. The surface CH4 uptake was positively correlated with soil temperature during the fallow season and negatively correlated with soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) and exchangeable NH4+ concentration during the growing season. Compared with the unplanted treatments, the presence of maize plants significantly decreased soil WFPS and increased surface CH4 uptake during the growing season. The two-year mean cumulative diffusive CH4 fluxes were also significantly increased by 33.1-36.3% at depths of 10-30 cm and by 15.8-66.4% at depths of 10-40 cm in the PO and PN treatments, respectively. Compared with the PO treatment, the PN treatment significantly increased the surface CH4 uptake and cumulative CH4 uptake at depths of 0-40 cm in 2015. There was no significant difference in the CH4 surface and subsoil fluxes between the CO and CN treatments. Our results suggested that N fertilization stimulated CH4 diffusion and uptake mainly by promoting maize growth and subsequently the soil water consumption on a dryland farm.																			0167-8809	1873-2305				FEB 1	2022	324								107716	10.1016/j.agee.2021.107716	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2021.107716		OCT 2021											WOS:000711633200005

Soil-Litter Mixing Mediates Drivers of Dryland Decomposition along a Continuum of Biotic and Abiotic Factors	ECOSYSTEMS												Litter decomposition is a key ecosystem process that determines rates of carbon and nutrient cycling. Photodegradation and soil-litter mixing have emerged as important drivers of dryland litter decomposition, but how these processes interact with decomposing microorganisms has received less attention. In this study, we examined the effects of ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B; 280-315 nm) and soil-litter mixing on the decomposition of litter and its associated microbial community in an arid shrubland. We performed a full factorial litter decomposition experiment using leaf litter from a dominant shrub (Prosopis velutina) and a dominant grass (Eragrostis lehmanniana) that were exposed to solar radiation with near-ambient or attenuated UV-B, and were either soil-free or soil-covered; we then quantified litter decomposition and microbial community composition over a 12 month period. In general, shrub litter decomposed more rapidly than grass litter regardless of soil coverage, likely due to its lower C:N. Attenuation of UV-B had modest effects on decomposition but UV-B exposure did increase fungal biomass, perhaps reflecting facilitative aspects of photodegradation. Both bacteria and fungi emerged as important regulators of decomposition, and microbial decomposition was indirectly mediated by litter C:N, soil coverage, and UV-B effects on the microbial community. Bacterial colonization was inhibited in soil-free treatments, but was facilitated when litter was soil-covered. These findings suggest that UV-B may play an important role in facilitating fungal decomposition of litter, while soil-litter mixing is fundamental for promoting bacterial decomposition of litter.

Production of a biocrust-cyanobacteria strain (Nostoc commune) for large-scale restoration of dryland soils	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY												Cyanobacteria colonize the soil surface in deserts where they coexist with other organisms such as mosses, lichens, bacteria, fungi, archaea, and microalgae, in communities known as biocrusts. Cyanobacteria are of interest for dryland restoration due to their capacity for survival under water stress, facilitating succession and influencing soil function recovery. In addition, their large-scale culturing in bioreactors is possible. The aims of this study were to optimize the biomass production of a soil cyanobacterium (Nostoc commune) and determine the feasibility of employing fertilizers instead of chemicals for their production. The suitability of the biomass produced in different culture media for inducing biocrusts was tested by inoculation on sterilized mine substrate and then measuring several soil properties. Results showed that the growth rate of biomass cultured in the fertilizer media (0.43 day(-1)) was close to the chemical media. After 3 months of incubation in soil the cyanobacteria surface coverage increased up to 36% and there was no difference between soils inoculated with biomass produced in chemical or fertilizer media. As the Mann and Myers medium made with fertilizers promoted the best soil improvements, such as increased soil organic carbon and exopolysaccharide content of 8.9 g kg(-1) and 2.2 mg g(-1), respectively, a growth model was calculated to optimize its production in this medium for future large-scale restoration. Our results demonstrate that Nostoc commune can be economically produced for improving degraded soils, reducing the cost of the medium by 295 euro ha(-1).

Thermography captures the differential sensitivity of dryland functional types to changes in rainfall event timing and magnitude	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												center dot Drylands of the southwestern United States are rapidly warming, and rainfall is becoming less frequent and more intense, with major yet poorly understood implications for ecosystem structure and function. Thermography-based estimates of plant temperature can be integrated with air temperature to infer changes in plant physiology and response to climate change. However, very few studies have evaluated plant temperature dynamics at high spatiotemporal resolution in rainfall pulse-driven dryland ecosystems. center dot We address this gap by incorporating high-frequency thermal imaging into a field-based precipitation manipulation experiment in a semi-arid grassland to investigate the impacts of rainfall temporal repackaging. center dot All other factors held constant, we found that fewer/larger precipitation events led to cooler plant temperatures (1.4 degrees C) compared to that of many/smaller precipitation events. Perennials, in particular, were 2.5 degrees C cooler than annuals under the fewest/largest treatment. center dot We show these patterns were driven by: increased and consistent soil moisture availability in the deeper soil layers in the fewest/largest treatment; and deeper roots of perennials providing access to deeper plant available water. Our findings highlight the potential for high spatiotemporal resolution thermography to quantify the differential sensitivity of plant functional groups to soil water availability. Detecting these sensitivities is vital to understanding the ecohydrological implications of hydroclimate change.

The soil analysis was conducted in 2019 and 2020 from CT and NT treatments from a long-term study conducted near Hays, KS, with N fertilizer rates of 0, 45, 90, and 134 kg N ha(-1). Averaged across years, SOC in the top 0-to-5-cm soil depth under NT was 19% greater than that measured in CT, but SOC was not different between the two tillage practices in the 5-to-15-cm depth. The SOC concentration increased by 24-25% within the top 0-to-5-cm soil depth with increasing N rate from 0 to 90 or 134 kg N ha(-1). Soil pH declined at rates of 0.004 and 0.007 for every kg ha(-1) increase in N rate for CT and NT treatments within the 0-to-5-cm soil depth. Nitrate-N concentration under NT at the top 0-5 cm soil was 55% more than CT but ammonium-N concentration was unaffected by tillage or N rate. Phosphorus (P), zinc (Zn), and iron (Fe) concentrations measured in the top 0-5 cm were 24, 34, and 33% greater in soils under NT compared with CT, respectively. Findings of the study suggest pH and SOC stratification in long-term NT systems can affect soil macro- and micronutrient concentrations and availability in dryland crop production systems.

Hierarchical architecture and lithofacies associations with detailed lithofacies characterizations were comprehensively described to document the architectural model, architectural element scale and gravel particle scale. (1) Nine lithofacies (i.e., Gmm, Gcm, Gcc, Gci, Gcl, Ss, Sm, Fsm and Fl) were identified and classified as gravel, sand and fine matrix deposits. These are typical depositional features of a mountainous dryland gravel-braided river. (2) Three architectural elements were identified, including channel (CH), gravel bar (GB) and overbank (OB). CH can be further divided into flow channel and abandoned channel, while GB consists of Central Gravel bar (CGB) and Margin Gravel bar (MGB). (3) The gravel bar is the key architectural element of the gravel braided river, with its geological attributes. The dimensions of GBs and their particles are various, but exhibit good relationships with each other. The grain size of GB decreases downstream, but the dimensions of GB do not. The bank erosion affects the GB dimensions, whereas channel incision and water flow velocity influence the grain size of GB. The conclusions can be applied to the dryland gravel braided river studies in tectonically active areas.																			1000-9515	1755-6724				FEB	2023	97	1					269	285		10.1111/1755-6724.14967	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-6724.14967													WOS:000952820100018
J	Pal, MK; Poria, S				Pal, Mrinal Kanti; Poria, Swarup			Role of herbivory in shaping the dryland vegetation ecosystem: Linking spiral vegetation patterns and nonlinear, nonlocal grazing	PHYSICAL REVIEW E												Self-organized vegetation patterns are an amazing aspect of dryland ecosystems; in addition to being visually appealing, patterns control how these water-deprived systems react to escalating environmental stress. Although there is a wide variety of vegetation patterns, little is known about the mechanisms behind spiral patterns. The well-known models that explain other vegetation patterns such stripes, rings, and fairy circles cannot account for these spirals. Here we have adopted a modeling approach in which the interplay between herbivore grazing and vegetation is found to be the reason why spirals form. To comprehend the nonlinear dependence of grazing on the availability vegetation, we have introduced a grazing term that gets saturated when forage is abundant. To account for the impact of the spatial nonhomogeneity in vegetation layout, it is thought that grazing is dependent on mean vegetation density rather than density at a single site. Results show how the system dynamics is changed fundamentally depending on the different types of grazing response. Incorporation of nonlocality into the herbivore grazing leads to spiral-shaped vegetation patterns only in natural grazing scenarios; however, no patterning is seen in human controlled herbivory. Overall, our research points to the nonlocal, nonlinear grazing behavior of herbivores as one of the major driving forces for the development of spiral patterns.

Increasing drought favors nonnative fishes in a dryland river: evidence from a multispecies demographic model	ECOSPHERE												Understanding how novel biological assemblages are structured in relation to dynamic environmental regimes remains a central challenge in ecology. Demographic approaches to modeling species assemblages show promise because they seek to represent fundamental relationships between population dynamics and environmental conditions. In dryland rivers, rapidly changing climate conditions have shifted drought and flooding regimes with implications for fish communities. Our goals were to (1) develop a mechanistic multispecies demographic model that links native and nonnative species with river flow regimes, and (2) evaluate demographic responses in population and community structure to changing flow regimes. Each fish species was represented by a stage-structured matrix, and species were coupled together into a multispecies framework through density-dependent relationships in reproduction. Then, community dynamics were simulated through time using annual flow events classified from gaged streamflow data. We parameterized the model with vital rates and flow-response relationships for a community of native and nonnative fishes using literature-derived values. We applied the simulation model to the Verde River (Arizona, USA), a major tributary within the Colorado River Basin, for the past half century (1%4-2017). Model validation revealed a match between model projections and relative abundance trends observed in a long-term fish monitoring dataset (1994-2008). At the beginning of the validation period (1994), model and survey observations showed that native species comprised approximately 80% of total abundance. Model projections beyond the survey data (2008-2017) predicted a shift from a native dominant to a normative dominant assemblage, coinciding with increasing drought frequency. Trade-offs between native and nonnative species dominance emerged from differences in mortality in response to the changing sequence of major flow events including spring floods, summer high flows, and droughts. In condusion, the demographic approach presented here provides a flexible modeling framework that is readily applied to other stream systems and species by adjusting or transferring, when appropriate, species vital rates and flow-event thresholds.

Nevertheless, there exists inherent uncertainty in such cases. General Circulation Models (GCMs) and future climate change scenarios (different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) in different future time periods) are among the major sources of uncertainty in projecting the impact of climate change on crop grain yield. This study quantified the different sources of uncertainty associated with future climate change impact on wheat grain yield in dryland environments (Shiraz, Hamedan, Sanandaj, Kermanshah and Khorramabad) in eastern and southern Iran. These five representative locations can be categorized into three climate classes: arid cold (Shiraz), semi-arid cold (Hamedan and Sanandaj) and semi-arid cool (Kermanshah and Khorramabad). Accordingly, the downscaled daily outputs of 29 GCMs under two RCPs (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) in the near future (2030s), middle future (2050s) and far future (2080s) were used as inputs for the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM)-wheat model. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to quantify the sources of uncertainty in projecting the impact of climate change on wheat grain yield. Years from 1980 to 2009 were regarded as the baseline period. The projection results indicated that wheat grain yield was expected to increase by 12.30%, 17.10%, and 17.70% in the near future (2030s), middle future (2050s) and far future (2080s), respectively. The increases differed under different RCPs in different future time periods, ranging from 11.70% (under RCP4.5 in the 2030s) to 20.20% (under RCP8.5 in the 2080s) by averaging all GCMs and locations, implying that future wheat grain yield depended largely upon the rising CO2 concentrations. ANOVA results revealed that more than 97.22% of the variance in future wheat grain yield was explained by locations, followed by scenarios, GCMs, and their interactions. Specifically, at the semi-arid climate locations (Hamedan, Sanandaj, Kermanshah and Khorramabad), most of the variations arose from the scenarios (77.25%), while at the arid climate location (Shiraz), GCMs (54.00%) accounted for the greatest variation. Overall, the ensemble use of a wide range of GCMs should be given priority to narrow the uncertainty when projecting wheat grain yield under changing climate conditions, particularly in dryland environments characterized by large fluctuations in rainfall and temperature. Moreover, the current research suggested some GCMs (e.g., the IPSL-CM5B-LR, CCSM4, and BNU-ESM) that made moderate effects in projecting the impact of climate change on wheat grain yield to be used to project future climate conditions in similar environments worldwide.																			1674-6767	2194-7783				MAY	2023	15	5					545	561		10.1007/s40333-023-0056-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-023-0056-x		APR 2023											WOS:000972776200001

Long-term trends and variability in the dryland microclimate of the Northern Cape Province, South Africa	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												A wealth of information on the extent and severity of global climate change has been produced through research over the past few decades. Global trends of the climate should be observable at a regional and local level, yet certain areas remain under-represented in both national and international research. This study presents an investigation into the microclimatic trends of the semi-arid/arid environment of the Northern Cape Province, South Africa. Long-term (1982-2016) historical daily meteorological data were analyzed using the RClimDex software package as well as other multi-temporal regression analyses. Results indicate an overall warming of the study sites, with rates of change varying between 1 and 4 degrees C century(-1). The overall increase in annual average air temperature observed at the three sites is linked to daytime warming trends. Total annual rainfall, as well as atmospheric water vapor, was found to be decreasing at significant rates across the sites, with serious implications for livestock agriculture in the region. Model outputs of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), 0-100-mm soil water and the reflection coefficient, indicate that observed changes in the microclimate are not a consequence of terrestrial factors. The results of the study indicate that the microclimate of the dryland Northern Cape environment is changing but at rates that are different to global and continental estimates. The study highlights the need for local climate change investigations, and also identifies limitations in using only ground-based datasets.

Thus, it is necessary to develop monitoring technology and three-dimensional (3D) characterisation methods for rapid, non-invasive, and accurate soil salinity measurement. This study presents a new framework combining sensor technology and an inversion algorithm to characterise 3D soil salinity. Four typical land-use types (natural desert, natural vegetation, apple orchard, and winter wheat farmland) in the Aksu region of southern Xinjiang were surveyed and apparent conductivity (ECa) data were recorded at depths of 0.75 m and 1.50 m. ECa data were converted to electrical conductivity and salinity characterisation was conducted following US. Salinity Laboratory recommendations. Ordinary Kriging interpolation was used to map the spatial distribution and an iterative inversion model was used to map the vertical distribution of soil salinity. Model parameters were adjusted several times and the accuracy of different inversion algorithms was compared to obtain the best inversion effect. As a result, the Multilevel Orthogonal Inversion model was developed to characterise 3D soil salinity for different land-use types. Due to crop activities including irrigation, managed land use types (apple orchard and winter wheat plots) typically exhibited weaker salinity than natural systems (desert and vegetation plots) but greater spatial variability overall. The proposed framework combining EM (electromagnetic) sensing and the 3D inversion algorithm can effectively characterise and visualise soil salinity for the entire soil profile, which is important for land evaluation and improvement.

In dryland semi-arid agroecosystems, any precipitation not transpired indicates crop yield that is below potential. Precipitation that is partitioned to deep percolation can transport nitrate out of the root zone, reducing nitrogen use efficiency and potentially contaminating groundwater. To mitigate loss of crop yield to drought, the practice of chemical summer-fallow (suppressing plant growth for a full growing season with herbicide) has been common in semi-arid regions to store water for the following growing season. However, precipitation losses during fallow tend to exceed the amount of precipitation stored, and fallow tends to increase nitrate leaching. We present model simulations informed by field observations that explore the interaction of crop rotation, weather, and soils as controls on precipitation partitioning and nitrate leaching. Simulations reveal that high intensity precipitation periods produce hot moments of deep percolation and nitrate leaching such that 54 % of deep percolation and 56 % of leaching occurs in two of 14 model years. Simulations indicate that thin soils (having limited water storage capacity) produce hot spots for deep percolation and nitrate leaching such that thinner soils (<25 cm) experience water and nitrate loss rates five to 16 times higher than thicker soils (>100 cm). The practice of fallow facilitates mineralization of soil organic nitrogen to nitrate and increases deep percolation, magnifying the interaction of hot moments and hot spots. Simulations suggest that a field with fallow in rotation once every three years experiences 55 % of its deep percolation and 43 % of its leaching losses during fallow years.					jones, clain a/F-1111-2013	Sigler, Adam/0000-0002-4815-0580; Ewing, Stephanie/0000-0003-0713-4266													0167-8809	1873-2305				DEC 1	2020	304								107158	10.1016/j.agee.2020.107158	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2020.107158													WOS:000581101600024

Field experiments were conducted over 3 yr (2016-2019) to investigate the effects of four treatments (CK, no-till with crushed straw left on the ground; RT, rotary tillage with crushed straw mixed into the 0-to-20-cm soil layer; DP, deep ploughing with crushed straw mixed into the 30-to-35-cm soil layer; SM, no-till with whole straw mulched on the surface) on soil water storage, yield and its components, and water use efficiency (WUE) of dryland maize in northern China. Compared with CK, the yield of RT, DP, and SM treatments increased by 2.3 to 68.3, 22.8 to 126.1% and 9.3 to 119.8%, respectively, during the 3 yr. The most significant increase was obtained in the drier year of 2019, though yields were lowest overall that year. The DP treatment had greater water storage in the upper soil layer (0-100 cm) in all 3 yr, followed by SM and RT. The average increment of precipitation use efficiency and WUE under RT, DP, and SM was 25.4, 58.6, and 48.6 and 20.7, 31.6, and 29.9%, respectively. The results indicated that numerically higher yield components and yields of dryland maize were observed upon DP and SM. Thus, these two practices (DP and SM) could be suitable field management choices to promote water storage and production of dryland maize in the northern China.

J	Akinyemi, FO; Ikanyeng, M; Muro, J				Akinyemi, Felicia O.; Ikanyeng, Mphoentle; Muro, Javier			Land cover change effects on land surface temperature trends in an African urbanizing dryland region	CITY AND ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS												Land use-land cover (LULC) association with land surface temperature (LST) is well known. Knowledge about land change effects on LST in urbanizing African drylands is very limited. We examined LST and vegetation variations in semi-arid Gaborone (Botswana's capital) using MODIS daytime and night-time LST (DNLST), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) between 2000 and 2018. Significant land transitions were identified in the land cover change map using Change Vector Analysis of Landsat-based biophysical indices of vegetation, water and bare soil. Artificial surface and tree-covered areas were net gaining categories, whereas cropland and grassland were net losing categories. Detailed profiling of DNLST trends and breakpoints was conducted in five relatively homogenous sites representing land cover/transitions. Increasing NDVI and DNLST trends found were significant. Per class, LST change at daytime and night-time are as follows: built-up areas (1.8 K, 2.2 K), Gaborone dam (5.7 K, 0.2 K), settlement expansion areas (4.6 K, 2.2 K), and rural settlement (2.0 K, 1.5 K). The cooling effect of irrigation on daytime LST was higher than night-time LST as daytime LST trend as low as -0.4 K was found in areas of irrigated croplands. Validation with synoptic station temperature data and dam water levels provides empirical evidence that MODIS gave credible DNLST estimates in this urbanizing dryland area. Our results also suggest the role of climate variability in urbanizing drylands alongside land cover change in controlling the LST.

Currently, no universal indicators are available to identify the effect of extreme climate events on specific crops of nutritional and commercial importance, as they need to be developed according to each species' physiology. Likewise, it is necessary to develop production qualifiers that allow us to identify whether the agricultural year presents high or low climatic hazards for a specific crop. In this study of roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) grown in dryland agricultural conditions in the Bajo Balsas, Michoacan, Mexico, we aimed to 1) generate and validate climatic hazard indicators and 2) propose an equation to calculate annual climatic hazards, considering the different phenological crop stages. We present both phenological and climatic information that is used for the development of 13 agmclimatic hazard indicators that have been proposed for the mselle crop in La Huacana a municipality in Michoacan. Artificial intelligence and neural networks were used for both weight variable identification in the equation and to validate the annual classification, which is derived from the proposed equation. Our proposed equation for the quick assessment of agmclimatic hazards for the mselle crop is a new tool that helps in planning and decision-making in the face of the growing presence of extreme climate events.

This paper presents a study of the Lodwar Alluvial Aquifer System (LAAS) in northwestern Kenya and its hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics, with the goal of understanding how to sustainably manage the groundwater system. As a result, the paper focuses on elucidating the hydrogeochemical and river-groundwater interaction (using environmental isotopes and major ion chemistry) of an aquifer that is located in the northwestern dryland of Kenya. The study utilised environmental isotopes of oxygen-18 (18O), deuterium (2H), and tritium (3H) as tracers for establishing recharge sources and origin of groundwater. A sampling campaign involving 112 water samples was conducted to establish isotopic compositions of rain, spring, surface water (rivers, scoop holes, dams and lake) and groundwater at the peak of the wet season in May 2018. The tritium values in the study area ranged from 1.1 to 2.4 TU. Considering the median values of 818O and 82H in surface water and groundwater samples, four clusters emerge based on the degree of enrichment; Cluster 1 comprises the lake water (818O = +6.01, 82H = +41.9); Cluster 2 is the Turkwel and Kawalase river water with slightly positive relative to VSMOW and with different 82H values (+7.6%o versus -9.8%o). The third cluster is the groundwater of the Shallow Alluvial Aquifer (SAA) and the Deep Aquifer (DA) (818O = -0.96%o and -0.70%o; and 82H = +0.4%o and +0.6%o, respectively). The last cluster comprises the most isotope-depleted waters of water pans, scoop holes, Intermediate Aquifer (IA) and Turkana Grit Shall Aquifer (TGSA) with median values ranging from -2.87%o to -2.48%o for 818O and -8.6%o and -16.4%o for 82H. While the SAA is mainly recharge by the Turkwel River, a relationship is observed between the values deuterium in the Kawalase (-9.6%o VSMOW) and IA (-8.6%o VSMOW). Understanding recharge sources and aquifer vulnerability of similar strategic aquifers helps scientists appropriately advise policymakers and the water community who develop sustainable water use, aquifer protection and conservation strategies. In addition, the study contributes scientific evidence of isotopic compositions of groundwater in the Horn of Africa. Furthermore, the evidence of surface water-groundwater interaction presents a case of a fragile dryland ecosystem. Future work will involve the installation of piezometers in strategic aquifer zones to monitor groundwater levels in relation to river gauging data to quantify the amount of recharge and establish the impacts of rainfall variability in the upstream catchment.																			1464-343X	1879-1956				OCT	2023	206								105043	10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2023.105043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2023.105043		AUG 2023											WOS:001080035000001

This study was initiated in the Tougou ephemeral river catchment (37 km(2)) to improve understanding of recharge pathways to a weathered rock aquifer in the dryland of Burkina Faso. It is based on field investigations conducted in 2016-2020 on a piezometric transect and large-diameter wells, perpendicular and longitudinal to the river, respectively. Geophysical measurements, lithologs analysis, permeability tests, groundwater and river level monitoring, and rainfall measurements were undertaken. The results showed a laterally continuous saprolite aquifer (10-22 m thick) overlain by residual soils beneath the river and discontinuous laterite on the banks. Below the river, the saprolite overlays the weathered schist aquifer with an upward or downward hydraulic gradient regardless of the seasons. The saprolite is replenished by focused recharge from the river and diffuse recharge from the rainfall on the banks, according to information from the groundwater hydrographs, groundwater tracing results, and cross-correlation between the groundwater levels and the two potential recharge sources (rainfall and river water). The low hydraulic conductivity, electrical resistivity tomography profiles and lithologs indicate restriction of diffuse and focused recharge through soil matrix infiltration, suggesting there are preferential recharge pathways. For the 2018-2020 period, the water-table fluctuation method provides recharge estimates of 14-51 mm/year on the northern bank, 10-36 mm/year on the southern bank and 148-194 mm/year in the riverbed.

Dynamic contributions of intermittent and perennial streams to fish beta diversity in dryland rivers	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim To determine the role of flow intermittence and species origin in shaping freshwater fish beta diversity across dryland riverscapes. Location Verde and Little Colorado River basins, United States. Methods Fish beta diversity was investigated in two large rivers with marked differences in basin-wide flow intermittence. Local site (continually flowing perennial vs. periodically flowing intermittent) and species (native vs. non-native) contributions to beta diversity were compared within each basin and over multiple decades (1987-2013) in relation to changing hydrologic conditions. Metacommunity dynamics were quantified using changes in alpha- (local), beta- and gamma- (regional) diversity through time. Results Beta-diversity patterns varied in relation to basin-wide intermittence. Intermittent sites were most influential to beta diversity where basin-wide intermittence was lower (Verde River), whereas perennial sites were most influential where basin-wide intermittence was higher (Little Colorado River). In intermittent sites, native fish species contributions to beta diversity tended to be higher than non-native species contributions. The relative contributions of perennial and intermittent sites to beta-diversity within each basin were invariant to annual flow regimes, whether atypically lower or higher than average flows, but somewhat related to intra-annual flow variation. Native species contributions to beta-diversity increased in years with high flow conditions in the Verde River. Over time, beta diversity decreased in the lower intermittence Verde River, indicating taxonomic homogenization, but remained relatively unchanged in the Little Colorado River. Main Conclusions Investigations of beta-diversity components over time are considered pivotal for conservation prioritization and planning. We found that both intermittent and perennial streams play complementary roles in supporting fish beta diversity, and that their relative contributions increase as basin wide availability of the habitat type decreases. Moreover, contributions of intermittent streams to overall beta diversity were relatively consistent through time and supported native fish diversity. Despite weakening policy protections of intermittent streams, these habitats are critical for supporting local species persistence and regional biodiversity.

J	Karban, CC; Barger, NN				Karban, Claire C.; Barger, Nichole N.			Seasonal effects of granivory on broadcast seeding restoration in a degraded semiarid grassland	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Granivores, such as rodents and harvester ants, are common in dryland ecosystems. In intact dryland ecosystems, the effects of such granivores on soil seed banks, plant community structure, and ecosystem functioning are well established. However, the effects of granivores on dryland restoration have received much less attention. In this study, we evaluated the seasonality of seed removal by harvester ants, seed preference of harvester ants, and effects of granivore exclosure on the soil seed bank at four sites in southeastern Utah. We studied two species of harvester ants, Pogonomyrmex rugosus and P. occidentalis. The foraging behavior of Pogonomyrmex spp. was temperature-dependent; they removed no seeds during winter months, and up to 80% of seeds during high activity in the summer. Despite seasonal differences in seed removal, Pogonomyrmex spp. did not show significant preferences for seed species. However, their seasonal foraging behavior translated into measurable differences in an experimental soil seed bank. Over the summer months, ants reduced the number of seeds in the seed bank by approximately 20%, but when ants were excluded during the winter, the number of seeds in the seed bank remained the same. This finding supports the timing of business-as-usual seeding practices of applying seeds in late fall. If seeds germinate in the first season after application, ant granivory is unlikely to pose a large barrier to establishment. However, if seeds remain dormant during the first year, as is common in many dryland species, seeds are vulnerable to ant granivory.

A two-year experiment was conducted on dryland maize (Zea mays L.) in a sub-humid but drought-prone climate zone to explore the responses of grain yield, N use efficiency (NUE), economic benefit, ammonia (NH3) volatilization and greenhouse gas emissions to various mulching methods (NM: non-mulching, SM: wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) straw mulching and RF: ridge-furrow cultivation with plastic film mulching on the ridge) and N types (U: urea, U + CRU: mixture of urea and controlled-release urea at a ratio of 3:7, U + DMPP: urea with 2 % 3, 4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate and U + NBPT: urea with 2 % N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide). The results showed that RF and SM significantly increased grain yield and NUE, and decreased residual soil mineral N in the 0-200 cm soil layer relative to NM, but the differences in these indices were not significant between RF and SM. The net benefit under SM was comparable to that under RF (1558.5 and 1613.6 USD ha(-1)). The RF treatment significantly increased global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) by 33.7 % and 20.4 % compared with NM, and by 71.9 % and 67.5 % compared with SM. Compared with urea, U + CRU, U + DMPP and U + NBPT exhibited promoting effect on grain yield and NUE, but decreased residual soil mineral N. Compared with U, U + NBPT and U + DMPP produced much lower NH3 volatilization and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission, respectively. Compared with U, U + CRU also reduced NH3 volatilization and N2O emission, but its economic benefit was 4.9 % lower. Both U + DMPP and U + NBPT exhibited inhibitory effect on methane (CH4) oxidation, but the CH4 pattern under U + CRU was inconsistent in the two years. The smallest GWP and GHGI were generally observed under U + DMPP among various N types. The interaction of mulching method and N type had significant influence on grain yield in 2019, CO2 emission in 2018, N2O emission, GWP and GHGI in both years. In conclusion, wheat straw mulching with nitrification inhibitor application achieved better balance among agronomic, economic and environmental benefits for dryland maize in northwest China.

J	Li, SL; Ma, Q; Zhou, CR; Yu, WT; Shangguan, ZP				Li, Shuailin; Ma, Qiang; Zhou, Changrui; Yu, Wantai; Shangguan, Zhouping			Applying biochar under topsoil facilitates soil carbon sequestration: A case study in a dryland agricultural system on the Loess Plateau	GEODERMA												The remarkable soil carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas mitigation effects of biochar have spurred great interest in exploring ways to maximize its benefits. However, it remains unclear how biochar application depth impacts soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and methane (CH4) uptake in upland soil. Therefore, we carried out a 16-month field experiment in a dryland agricultural system to answer the above questions. Woody biochar (20 t ha(-1)) was mixed into three soil layers: 0-10 cm (BC0-10cm)(,) 10-20 cm (BC10-20cm), and 0-20 cm (BC0-20cm). Soil without biochar addition was used as the control (CK). We monitored soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes continuously and determined the metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) and the sensitivity of soil respiration to temperature (Q(10)). The results indicated that CO2 emissions, CH4 uptake, qCO(2) and Q(10) were significantly affected by biochar application depth. Overall, compared with CK, BC0-10cm increased total CO2 emissions by 10.13%, while BC10-20cm and BC0-20cm showed no significant effect. BC0-10cm and BC0-20cm exhibited greater soil CH4 uptake enhancement than BC10-20cm, but the enhanced CH4 uptake resulted in limited net greenhouse gas mitigation. BC10-20cm and BC0-20cm had a lower qCO(2) than the other treatments, which likely increased the carbon use efficiency and decreased the stress on soil microbes, but BC0-10cm showed the opposite effect. In addition, BC0-10cm significantly reduced Q(10) mainly due to the enhanced lability of the native carbon and microbial activities. Changes in environmental factors in the 0-10 cm soil largely explained the variations in CO2 emissions, CH4 uptake and Q(10) (>88%). Nevertheless, the enhanced microbial biomass in the 10-20 cm soil helped lower qCO(2) in the whole 0-20 cm layer. In summary, adding biochar to surface soil (0-10 cm) likely accelerates carbon loss, due to the strong shift in the environment of the surface soil caused by complex interactions among hydrothermal conditions, nutrient levels (i.e., N, NH4+, NO3 and available P) and labile carbon. However, adding biochar to subsurface soil (10-20 cm) can effectively avoid severe disturbance of the surface soil environment and thus benefit soil carbon sequestration in the long term.					ma, qiang/HCI-1013-2022	Li, Shuailin/0000-0001-9743-2915													0016-7061	1872-6259				DEC 1	2021	403								115186	10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115186	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115186		MAY 2021											WOS:000671591200004

Relict canals of the Tehuacan Valley, Mexico: A Middle- to Late-Holocene dryland socio-hydrological system	HOLOCENE												The travertine-lined irrigation canal networks of the Tehuacan Valley, Mexico allowed pre-Hispanic indigenous communities to overcome risks of crop failures in an arid setting. Segments of these systems are still in use today, therefore understanding when and how these irrigation networks functioned allows us to identify which attributes of a coupled socio-hydrological system are important for maintaining the long-term resilience of irrigation systems in drylands. This paper summarizes the results of an interdisciplinary study of this prehispanic irrigation network involving mapping, radiometric dating, and diatom analyses of materials extracted from the travertine lined canals. All of the canal networks were functioning by ca. 2000 BC, at the transition from the Late Archaic to the Formative period, which is before archeological evidence for widespread community-level aggregation. Provocatively, some canals are potentially as old as 6000-4000 BC, which would mean that hunter-gatherers initiated irrigation coevally with the introduction of semi-domesticated maize, a tropical species which would require supplemental water in this arid context. The canals both facilitated agricultural intensification and enhanced the distribution of aquatic ecosystems. The resilience of these systems to their unique spring dependent context demanded frequent maintenance and the integration of multiple canal networks to mitigate geohydrological vulnerabilities of reduced discharge. These conditions set up a long-term reciprocal dynamic between people and water in the Tehuacan Valley. The results demonstrate that rigidities inherent to tightly coupled socio-hydrological systems in dryland settings were overcome by institutional arrangements first developed by indigenous communities deep in prehistory.

However, more quantitative research has been based on the freshwater ecosystem services of static situations, and less on the flow conditions. We established a comprehensive modeling framework for the analysis of water security pattern based on the physical flow (PF) and ecosystem service flow (ESF) of freshwater. The results for Yellow River Basin showed that the water-scarce area have reduced in the past two decades. The PF of freshwater relieves water stress on an average of 52.1 % of the static water in scarce areas per year. The problem in water-deficient areas meanly lies on the water supply side. These results highlight the importance of PF from the upstream to downstream, which is critical for formulating sustainable management strategies in safeguarding long-term regional freshwater resource security.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				JAN 20	2023	857		3						159549	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159549	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159549		OCT 2022						36265644					WOS:000897151600005
J	Chen, BM; Feng, WT; Jing, X; Wang, YG				Chen, Bingming; Feng, Wenting; Jing, Xin; Wang, Yugang			Dryland agricultural expansion leads to lower content and higher variability of soil inorganic carbon in topsoil	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Soil inorganic carbon (SIC) is of key importance to the global carbon cycle and mitigating climate change. However, decades of agricultural expansion in the drylands have resulted in vast and fragmented agricultural landscapes and have potentially affected SIC. Previous studies investigating the impact of agricultural expansion on SIC have primarily focused on cultivation impacts, while ignoring edge effects from agricultural land boundaries. Here, we combined cultivation impacts with edge effects and fully evaluated the impacts of agricultural expansion on SIC. We conducted spatial statistical and buffer analyses using a SIC distribution map, which was developed using 388 sample points in 0 - 20 cm topsoil over the Sangong River watershed in drylands of China. We found that decades-long agricultural expansion resulted in lower content and higher variability of SIC in topsoil. Specifically, cultivation decreased SIC content by 28.57% (1.64 g kg-1) and increased SIC variability by 95.71% (0.67 g kg- 1) in agricultural lands. Edge effects altered SIC content by - 1.95-11.51% (-0.11 to 0.54 g kg- 1) and increased SIC variability by 39.14% (0.34 g kg- 1) at edges. In addition, we found that fewer sampling points in areas with high SIC variability (e.g., agricultural lands and edges) decreased the estimation accuracy. Our study highlights the need for SIC conservation during dryland agricultural expansion. Also, it suggests that as many sampling points as possible should be set in high variability areas, which is especially useful for accurately estimating SIC distribution in drylands.

People there have been relying on the terraced fields for centuries, using various plants, including medicinal plants. However, little information was reported about the flora in SDSTS, nor medicinal plants. Thus, the present study aims to identify and document medicinal plants traditionally used by the local people living around the SDSTS and associated ethnobotanical knowledge. Methods: We conducted investigations in Shexian County, Hebei Province, North China, where SDSTS is distributed. Then, Wangjinzhuang, a community located in the core zone of SDSTS, was chosen as the case site. We selected the informants through purposive and snowball sampling. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews, participant observation, and key informant interviews. The medicinal plants traditionally used by the local people were documented and analyzed. We examined and confirmed the botanical identification based on voucher specimens and by cross-checking the descriptions with the series of books, scientific papers on medicinal plants, and the plant databases. Results: The local people have rich traditional knowledge to collect and use medicinal plants in SDSTS. Records of 123 medicinal plant species belonging to 51 families were obtained from SDSTS. Asteraceae was represented by 16 species, followed by Fabaceae, Lamiaceae and Ranunculaceae. ( They all have 8 species.) The majority of the reported plant species were commonly processed into decoctions. And 180 diseases affecting humans were reported to be treated with traditional medicinal plants from SDSTS. Conclusion: It is the first ethnobotanical study on medicinal plants in China-Nationally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems, and in globally important agricultural heritage systems as well. Medicinal plants are crucial for people living in Shexian County. It is necessary to recognize and respect traditional knowledge peculiar to the mountainous region of northern China, especially for those involved in the human-nature interaction and the role of knowledge in agrobiodiversity conservation and rural development that local residents have persisted for centuries.

J	Das, BT; Schmidt, S; Biggs, J; Lester, DW; Bourne, N; Huth, NI				Das, Bianca T.; Schmidt, Susanne; Biggs, Jody; Lester, David W.; Bourne, Nicholas; Huth, Neil, I			Simulating long-term phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbon dynamics to advance nutrient assessment in dryland cropping	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Soil chemical fertility has steadily declined in tropical and subtropical agriculture with depleted stocks of phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N), and carbon (C). Assessing the dynamics of these elements and their interactions on crop productivity in dryland cropping are complex because climate often dictates crop nutrient response. This results in under- or over- fertilising crops, suboptimal crop yield, and fertiliser inefficiency. The Agricultural Productions Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model accounts for C x N x climate interactions, but simulation of P dynamics is constrained by a dearth of suitable data. To address this problem, we used a novel approach to simulate P, N, and C dynamics at a 35-year long-term field trial, where a broad range of N (0, 40, 80, 120 kg ha(-1)) and P (0, 10, 20 kg ha(-1)) fertiliser rates were consistently applied. We parameterised the soil P model with quantified adsorption isotherms and by assuming correspondence between conceptual soil P pools and Hedley fractionation pools. Soil N and C dynamics were parameterised with measured organic N, C, and charcoal content to estimate organic matter decay coefficients, pool sizes, and C:N ratios. APSIM accounted for variation in mean N export (94%), crop yield (88%), and P export (62%) across the 12 treatments, and reproduced interannual variation in N x P effects for crop yield and N export, where crop response was strongly mediated by N supply and water availability. APSIM also identified the long-term depletion or accumulation of soil P, N, and C in most treatments. P fractionation and isotherm measurements are labour intensive but worthwhile, and future efforts should work to consolidate a database for different soil types. Better informed P modelling will provide insights into the effects of climate variability on soil fertility and crop productivity, and guide management practices to deliver better fertiliser efficiency and maintain soil organic C.

P.; Bhayal, Divya; Meena, Kamlesh			Impact of Foliar Spray of NPK and Zn on Soybean for Growth, Yield, Quality, Energetics and Carbon Footprint under Dryland Condition at Indore	LEGUME RESEARCH												Background: Dryland is characterised by drought/dry spell (s) of 10 to 15 days and is the main reason for decline in soybean production. The aim of this study was to develop a strategy of drought amelioration by using foliar sprays and enhancement of yield, quality, energetics and carbon footprint. Methods: A field experiment was carried out at Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia Krishi Vishwa Vidyalaya, College of Agriculture, Indore, (M.P.) during 2017-18 under spilt-plot design having two main plot treatments viz., foliar application at dry spell (F-1), foliar application after dry spell (F-2) and seven sub plot treatments i.e. different variants of foliar sprays (DVFS). Different growth, yield, quality, energetic and carbon footprint traits were recorded. The data were analyzed using standard statistical procedures. Result: The highest growth, yield, quality and energetic parameters were recorded for F-1 as compared to F-2. In case of DVFS, foliar application of water soluble complex fertilizer 19:19:19 (NPK) @ 0.5% + 0.5% ZnSO4 (T-4) produced maximum values for growth, energetics, carbon carbon footprint, oil (22.5%) and protein (43.1%) content as well as produced maximum yield.

Dryland Winter Wheat Production and Its Relationship to Fine-Scale Soil Carbon Heterogeneity-A Case Study in the US Central High Plains	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Soil carbon plays a key role in maintaining soil quality, but its direct impact on crop yields depends on the interplay of different factors. This study aims to study fine-spatial variation soil properties and their effect on grain productivity in fallow-wheat cropping systems in the US central High Plains. We evaluate wheat yields in relation to soil macro and micronutrients, total C (TC), and texture as well as subtle variations in field elevation. To document soil-yield relationships at a fine spatial scale, soil sampling (0-15 and 15-30 cm depths) was conducted using a regular 30 m grid spacing in eleven adjacent fields. Interpolated yield maps indicated that the availability of key nutrients and textures contributed to the spatial distribution of wheat productivity. Random forest (RF) showed that these soil attributes were able to explain slightly under 30% of the spatial variation in crop yields. Our findings demonstrate that TC can often serve as a reliable proxy for delineating yield-based management zones, even in inherently low C soils. In addition, Fe, Zn, SO4-S, sand, and subtle topographic changes were also critical factors affecting wheat yield. Our results highlight that developing management zones in these soils relying exclusively on soil information is not straightforward. However, the high level of within-field spatial variability observed needs to be addressed.

Geophysical Reconnaissance for Siting Dryland Critical-Zone Monitoring Experiments in Southern New Mexico, USA	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENGINEERING GEOPHYSICS												A dryland critical-zone observatory is planned on a piedmont setting of the Jornada Experimental Range northeast of Las Cruces, New Mexico, near a similar to 10-yr eddy flux covariance tower and vegetation monitoring experiment and a 2-yr old water-uptake rainfall infiltration experiment. We carried out several geophysical surveys to help select sites that minimize geologic complexity for follow up hydrologic and biogeochemical studies that will be conducted by other researchers. First, we conducted a review of regional topography, gravity, and magnetics prior to a site visit and then collected reconnaissance magnetic and electromagnetic data to aid in planning more detailed geophysical site characterization surveys. Our initial topographic analysis using 1/3 arc-second digital elevation models (DEMs) showed the proposed area had an out-of-equilibrium curvature pointing to active erosion and possible faulting. Short-wavelength step-like topographic anomalies in the DEMs were confirmed in LiDAR elevations, and are consistent with erosionally resistant soil horizons in the old alluvial fan deposits. Comparison of 2-D density and susceptibility models based on nearby (3-8 km) hydrostratigraphic studies established that the observed regional gravity and magnetic anomalies were larger than could be modeled with the 2-D structural constraints, and established the station spacing our reconnaissance surveys would require to sample shallow soil variations. Our first site visit confirmed the general fault locations and we identified three outcropping caliche horizons distinct to alluvial channel, proximal splay and distal splay deposits in a several hundred-meter traverse that are consistent with the short-wavelength topographic features. In order to plan additional seismic, radar, gravity, and electrical surveys within a region of such high potential variability, we collected magnetic field and magnetic susceptibility measurements along two profiles at 10-50 m spacing. We found anomalies consistent with two projected faults, as well as other bedrock structures, a result significantly more complex than prior regional hydrostratigraphic mapping had suggested. We also conducted a more limited 0.5 km long ground conductivity survey with 5 m spacing that traversed the rainfall infiltration experiment site and found anomalies that aligned with one of the projected faults. The results showed deep (>6 m) 50 mS/m (milliSiemens/meter) values, indicating moister soils, on the footwall side, dropping to 20 mS/m after crossing the fault, consistent with previous observations that normal faults in the Rio Grande Valley asymmetrically influence fluid flow.																			1083-1363	1943-2658				DEC	2021	26	4					255	266																WOS:000753059800002

Impacts of Dryland Cropping Systems on Ground Beetle Communities (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in the Northern Great Plains	JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE												Ground beetles are natural predators of insect pests and small seeds in agroecosystems. In semiarid cropping systems of the Northern Great Plains, there is a lack of knowledge to how ground beetles are affected by diversified cover crop rotations. In a 2-yr study (2018 and 2019), our experiment was a restricted-randomization strip-plot design, comprising summer fallow, an early-season cover crop mixture (five species), and a mid-season cover crop mixture (seven species), with three cover crop termination methods (i.e., herbicide, grazing, and haying). Using pitfall traps, we sampled ground beetles in five 48-h intervals throughout the growing season (n = 135 per year) using growing degree day (GDD) accumulations to better understand changes to ground beetle communities. Data analysis included the use of linear mixed-effects models, perMANOVA, and non-metric multidimensional scaling ordinations. We did not observe differences among cover crop termination methods; however, activity density in the early-season cover crop mixture decreased and in summer fallow increased throughout the growing season, whereas the mid-season cover crop mixture peaked in the middle of the summer. Ground beetle richness and evenness showed a nonlinear tendency, peaking in the middle of the growing season, with marginal differences between cover crops or fallow after the termination events. Also, differences in ground beetle composition were greatest in the early- and mid-season cover crop mixtures earlier in the growing season. Our study supports the use of cover crop mixtures to enhance ground beetle communities, with potential implications for pest management in dryland cropping systems.

Cuevas; van Toorenenburg, Koen A.; Wallinga, Jakob			Spatio-temporal reconstruction of avulsion history at the terminus of a modern dryland river system	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Fluvial depositional architecture in an unconfined environment is governed by sediment dispersal across the alluvial plain through river-path switching by avulsion. Documented inter-avulsion periodicity from modern rivers ranges from tens to over a thousand years. In this study, a quantitative spatio-temporal reconstruction of avulsion history is presented of the non-vegetated and pristine modern Rio Colorado dryland river system in the semi-arid Altiplano Basin (Bolivia), based on the integrated analysis of satellite imagery and absolute age dating using optically stimulated luminescence, complemented with sedimentological and geomorphological ground-truth data. This approach enables us to reconstruct the chronological order of channel belts of the Rio Colorado, to determine avulsion recurrence time and inter-avulsion periodicity, to identify mechanisms for flow path changes, and to present a morphodynamic model for the spatio-temporal evolution of fluvial deposits in a semi-arid environment. In a maximum timespan of 12.71 +/- 1.5 ka, successive avulsions of the Rio Colorado created a sheet of interconnected fluvial deposits, consisting of diverging and juxtaposed alluvial ridges that formed by sediment aggradation in point bars, crevasse splays, levees, and on the channel floor. The ridges show lateral onlap and amalgamation as the result of repeated avulsion and compensational stacking, whereby the river avoided the positive alluvial-ridge relief of its precursors. The resultant morphology is fan-shaped, convex-up with a surface area of approximately 500 km(2) and a maximum observed thickness of 3 m. The results show inter-avulsion periods of the river of up to 1.28 +/- 0.34 ka. A paucity in fluvial activity around 2 ka BP, and at present, is interpreted as the result of low river discharge related to long-term dry periodicity in the El Nino Southern Oscillation circulation system. Each river path started as a low sinuous, single-thread channel in a narrow belt, and in time increased its width and sinuosity by point-bar expansion and rotation.

In addition, inoculants based on soil microorganisms, such as cyanobacteria, are being applied successfully in soil restoration to improve soil stability and fertility in agriculture. However, the combination of SS and cyanobacteria inoculation is an unexplored application that may be highly beneficial to soil. In this outdoor experiment, we studied the ability of cyanobacteria inoculum to grow on degraded soil amended with different concentrations of composted SS, and examined the effects of both SS concentration and cyanobacteria application on carbon gain and soil stability. We also explored the feasibility of using cyanobacteria for immobilizing salts in SS-amended soil. Our results showed that cyanobacteria growth increased in the soil amended with the lowest SS concentration tested (5 t ha(-1), on soil 2 cm deep), as shown by its higher chlorophyll a content and associated deeper spectral absorption peak at 680 nm. At higher SS concentrations, inoculum growth decreased, which was attributed to competition of the inoculated cyanobacteria with the native SS bacterial community. However, SS significantly enhanced soil organic carbon gain and tightly-bound exopolysaccharide content. Cyanobacteria inoculation significantly improved soil stability and reduced soil's wind erodibility. Moreover, it led to a decrease in the lixiviate electrical conductivity of salt-contaminated soils, indicating its potential for salt immobilization and soil bioremediation. Therefore, cyanobacteria inoculation, along with adequately dosed SS surface application, is an efficient strategy for improving carbon gain and surface stability in dryland agricultural soil.

Short; Entekhabi, Dara			Landscape-Scale Plant Water Content and Carbon Flux Behavior Following Moisture Pulses: From Dryland to Mesic Environments	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Rain pulses followed by interstorm drying periods are the fundamental units of water input into ecosystems on subweekly time scales. It is essential to understand landscape-scale vegetation responses on these unit time scales as they may describe sensitivity of landscape water, carbon, and energy cycles to shifts in rainfall intensity and frequency, even if the average seasonal precipitation remains unchanged. Because pulse investigations are primarily carried out in drylands, little is known about the characteristics and extent of ecosystem plant pulse responses across the broader range of climates and biomes. Using satellite-based plant water content (from vegetation optical depth) and plant carbon uptake observations from eddy covariance towers across the continental United States climate gradient (dry to humid), we characterize large-scale plant carbon and water uptake responses to rain pulses during spring and summer months. We find that while all ecosystems in the study region show discernable plant water content and carbon flux responses to rain pulses, drier ecosystems exhibit more frequent and longer duration responses. Unlike mesic environments, drylands show significantly different responses under varying antecedent soil moisture and pulse magnitude conditions; the largest water and carbon uptakes follow large pulses on initially wet soils. We detect soil moisture thresholds primarily in drylands, which can partly explain dryland vegetation's different responses under dry and wet conditions. We conclude that vegetation responds to individual pulses of water availability across all climates and therefore a range of ecosystems are sensitive to rainfall distributions beyond simple seasonal precipitation totals.

This study was conducted (i) to assess the influence of tillage timing and intensity on soil and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) macronutrient concentration of a winter wheat-dry pea (Piston sativum L.) rotation (WW-P) under a dryland cropping system, and (ii) to compare macronutrients in the tillage treatments with a nearby long-term grass pasture (GP). The tillage treatments were fall tillage (FT), spring tillage (ST), no-tillage (NT) and disk/chisel tillage (DT/CT). Soil samples from 1995, 2005, and 2015 were analyzed to determine the concentration of soil organic carbon (SOC), total N and S, Mehlich III extractable P, K, Ca, and Mg, and soil pH. The impact of tillage on soil macronutrient concentration was evident after 52 years of WW-P. As a result, greater concentration of SOC, total S, and extractable P, and K were observed under NT than under FT or ST. The WW-P plots lost 28, 46, and 67% of SOC, Mg, and S, respectively, in the top 10 cm of soil compared with the GP plots, whereas the NT plots were the only plots in WW-P to maintain a P concentration (99 mg P kg(-1)) comparable with GP plots (102 mg P kg(-1)) at the same depth. The results indicated that NT could be beneficial to recharge the soil nutrient pool over time compared to FT or ST.

Using the Composite Land Degradation Index, this study assessed physical, chemical and biological degradation by determining their extent and severity. Palapye, an agro-pastoral region in eastern Botswana was used as a case study. Land degradation maps (status and indicators) were created with data from the field, soil chemical properties and image interpretation. Areas in the vicinity of settlements with Luvisols at elevations between 773 and 893 m were most degraded, implying impacts from human activities. This study developed a comprehensive list of of land degradation indicators for Botswana and created additional symbols for mapping indicators. Creation of these reference data for 2015 will facilitate the monitoring of land degradation in Palapye.

Schott] accessions under dryland conditions in South Africa	ACTA AGRICULTURAE SCANDINAVICA SECTION B-SOIL AND PLANT SCIENCE												Taro [Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott] is an important underutilised staple food crop in South Africa, with a lot of potential to address food insecurity among poor rural households. Development of high yielding stable taro cultivars is one of the most important goals of plant breeders. Twenty-nine taro accessions collected from major taro producing regions of the country were evaluated for growth performance, yield potential and stability under dryland conditions at two sites (Umbumbulu and Roodeplaat) in 2013, 2014 and 2015 cropping seasons. The experiment was laid in a randomised complete block design replicated three times. Growth and yield traits were measured. Analysis of variance and correlation analysis was done on all measured traits. The genotype by environment interaction was analysed using additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI). As a result, significant variation was observed for most of the traits except number of leaves and leaf width as well as number of suckers, while all the traits showed significant variation for location by year interaction. Number of corms showed significant variation for location by year by genotype interaction among all the traits evaluated. Genotype effect was highly significant (p < .01) on plant height, corm length, number of corms and significant (p < .05) on yield. The significant difference between genotypes for these traits proves that there was a genetic variability and there is a scope for selection. The correlation study also reveals that majority of the characters were positively correlated with each other. Total yield was positively and highly significantly (p < .01) correlated with all the measured traits. AMMI was effective in identifying stable genotypes. The top ranking cultivars per environment may be considered for cultivation under the specific environment, the stable cultivars may be considered for cultivation across all the taro growing regions.					van Rensburg, Willem Jansen/AAJ-6434-2021; Gerrano, Abe Shegro/F-2253-2016	Gerrano, Abe Shegro/0000-0001-7472-8246; Manjeru, Pepukai/0000-0001-9784-4725; Jansen van Rensburg, Willem Sternberg/0000-0002-5684-6174													0906-4710	1651-1913				APR 3	2019	69	3					219	227		10.1080/09064710.2018.1530296	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064710.2018.1530296													WOS:000456150400004

Biocrust islands enhance infiltration, and reduce runoff and sediment yield on a heavily salinized dryland soil	GEODERMA												Salinity and sodicity are major forms of land degradation in drylands worldwide, reducing soil function, and threatening pastoral livelihoods. Dryland soils are often dominated by biocrusts, surface aggregations of lichens, bryophytes, fungi and other minute organisms that stabilize surface soils. Biocrusts could have a role in maintaining hydrological functions in heavily salinized areas, but there have been few studies, and the mechanisms are poorly understood. We tested whether biocrust mosses and lichens enhanced infiltration, and reduced runoff and sediment yield, on biocrusted islands scattered among extensive patches of bare highly saline soils in northeaster Iran. Biocrusted soils had greater cumulative infiltration and hydraulic conductivity, less runoff, which commenced later, and lower sediment yields than bare soils. The water content of biocrusted soils was greater than bare soils, but only at low matric potentials. Biocrusted surfaces were alkaline, more sandy, had lower levels of sodium, chloride, and calcium-plus-magnesium ions, and a lower sodium absorption ratio than bare soils. Structural equation modelling showed that increasing salinity was associated with a suppression of the negative effect of biocrusts on runoff. Potential mechanisms for reduced runoff likely relate to enhanced soil aggregation and porosity of biocrusted soils leading to greater retention of soil water content at low matric potentials, as well as an ability of mosses and lichens to capture and store surface water or to permit infiltration into the uppermost surface layers. Overall, our findings reveal a strong association between moss- and lichendominant biocrusts and soil hydrological processes, and suggest that these crusts play an important role in maintaining hydrological function in heavily salinized soils.

Thinning decreased soil respiration differently in two dryland Mediterranean forests with contrasted soil temperature and humidity regimes	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												The effects of a thinning treatment on soil respiration (Rs) were analysed in two dryland forest types with a Mediterranean climate in east Spain: a dry subhumid holm oak forest (Quercus ilex subsp. ballota) in La Hunde; a semiarid postfire regenerated Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) forest in Sierra Calderona. Two twin plots were established at each site: one was thinned and the other was the control. Rs, soil humidity and temperature were measured regularly in the field at nine points per plot distributed into three blocks along the slope for 3 years at HU and for 2 years at CA after forest treatment. Soil heterotrophic activity was measured in laboratory on soil samples obtained bimonthly from December 2012 to June 2013 at the HU site. Seasonal Rs distribution gave low values in winter, began to increase in spring before lowering as soil dried in summer. This scenario indicates that with a semiarid climate, soil respiration is controlled by both soil humidity and soil temperature. Throughout the study period, the mean Rs value in the HU C plot was 13% higher than at HU T, and was 26% higher at CA C than the corresponding CA T plot value, being the differences significantly higher in control plots during active growing periods. Soil microclimatic variables explain the biggest proportion of variability for Rs: soil temperature explained 24.1% of total variability for Rs in the dry subhumid forest; soil humidity accounted for 24.6% of total variability for Rs in the semiarid forest. As Mediterranean climates are characterised by wide interannual variability, Rs showed considerable variability over the years, which can mask the effect caused by thinning treatment.

Seeding rate and nitrogen fertilizer rate effect on dryland no-till hard red spring wheat yield and quality	AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES & ENVIRONMENT												Increasing the efficiency of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production is vitally important to Montana growers' bottom line. In semiarid regions of the Northern Great Plains, agronomic practices must aim at maximum capture and utilization efficiency of plant growth resources. Appropriate plant population and N management are important for optimizing wheat yield and quality by enhancing N uptake and improving nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). Field experiments were conducted in 2014 at two locations in northcentral Montana. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of four N levels (0, 28, 84, and 140 kg N ha(-1)) in dryland no-till hard red spring wheat seeded at two seeding rate levels (67 and 135 kg ha(-1) pure live seed [PLS]). Nitrogen rate significantly improved wheat grain yield, grain protein content, protein yield, and N uptake at both locations, and NUE at one of two locations. The 135 kg ha(-1) did not have an advantage over the 67 kg ha(-1) PLS seeding rate, resulting in comparable wheat grain parameters, N uptake, and NUE. Wheat yield and quality was highest at 140 kg N ha(-1); higher N rate (especially split-applied) may have improved wheat production (especially grain protein content) further.

Biodegradable film (BF) is considered an alternative to conventional polyethylene film (PF), but its feasibility to replace PF needs to be verified. Thus, we conducted a two-year field experiment in the Loess Plateau region of China, exploring the effects of residual biodegradable film and polyethylene film (RBF and RPF) on soil moisture, maize root, and productivity at different residual levels (75 kg ha(-1), 150 kg ha(-1) and 300 kg ha(-1)). Regardless of the residual film type, soil water content (SWC), root length density (RLD), and root surface area density (RSD) all decreased with increasing residual level; this phenomenon observed significant differences when the residual level exceeded 150 kg ha(-1). Different organs (root and shoot) of maize differed in their sensitivity and sensitivity period to residual film. The two-year degradation rate of RBF was 59.24%, which was higher than that of RPF. Compared to the RPF treatments, the SWC, RLD, RSD, biomass, and root-shoot ratio of the RBF treatments were closer to the no residual film treatment in the second maize growing season. After the two-year experiment, compared to the grain yield, water use efficiency, and precipitation use efficiency of the RPF treatments, that of the RBF treatments increased 0.41-6.24%, 0.12-4.44%, and 0.41-06.24%. The application of BF to replace PF is beneficial to sustainable maize production in dryland, but finding efficient methods to recycle the residual film remains a priority.					张, 贵鑫/GRO-0384-2022	张, 贵鑫/0009-0003-4982-1432; XIa, Zhenqing/0000-0002-7326-4459														2077-0472				FEB	2023	13	2							332	10.3390/agriculture13020332	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13020332													WOS:000937813000001

The objective was to determine if liveweight production by sheep was enhanced by inclusion of a companion grass species with lucerne. Over five growth seasons (2012/2013-2016/2017) annual liveweight production ranged from 439 kg/ha (lucerne/grass mixes in 2016/2017) to 883 kg/ha (lucerne in 2013/2014). Liveweight produced from the monoculture was greater than, or equal to, that of the mixes every year. Dry matter yields ranged from 6.3 (lucerne and lucerne/cocksfoot in 2016/2017) to 16.2 t/ha/yr (lucerne in 2013/2014) primarily due to differences in in-season rainfall. Annual yield from the monoculture was less than, or equal to, lucerne/grass mixes in most years. The relationship between liveweight production and lucerne yield was strong (R-2 = 0.84). Earlier grazing of the mixes occurred in two of five years. After two years liveweight production from the lucerne/grass mixes was consistently lower than that achieved from the monoculture. However, in commercial situations drilling a runout lucerne stand with grass to extend stand life may be beneficial to provide an introductory feed prior to grazing a lucerne monoculture.

J	Chanza, N; Musakwa, W				Chanza, Nelson; Musakwa, Walter			Ecological and Hydrological Indicators of Climate Change Observed by Dryland Communities of Malipati in Chiredzi, Zimbabwe	DIVERSITY-BASEL												Existing evidence about climate change in Zimbabwe has tended to focus more on elements and events of the climate system, marginalizing changes in the hydrological and ecological system. To contribute to the improved understanding of climate change, this study captured the observations of climate change in Malipati, a remote agrarian dryland area in the Chiredzi District, Zimbabwe. The aim of the study was to gather detailed insights about perceived environmental changes using the evidence drawn from local and indigenous populations who have close interactions with their natural environment. A household questionnaire-based survey with randomly chosen farmers (n = 116) revealed that participants' observations of changes in hydrological and ecological system were consistent with available evidence of increasing temperatures and little rainfall recorded in the district. Results also showed high sensitivity of the area to climate change that manifest in various indicators: hydrological changes in rivers, streams, swamps, and ground water; and ecological changes through the behaviour of trees, insects, birds, and wild animals. Sex and age of the participants did not influence the way they perceived most of these changes (p > 0.05). However, education and the period of stay in the area were related to the respondents' perceived changes in river flows and siltation, and the conditions of swamps (p < 0.05). Our study also revealed deeper insights about the human-biodiversity interactions in the face of climate change in unique areas where communities live alongside wildlife. The evidence drawn from local and indigenous populations can be used to inform local-based solutions to the growing problems of climate change and biodiversity loss. Future studies would need to further examine such areas to understand the mitigation and adaptation practices that would promote the sustainable co-existence of humans and wildlife.

This area has been characterised by a long history of natural resource exploitation, especially soil and native vegetation, and the arrival and rapid expansion of monoculture forest plantations resulting in serious environmental degradation issues. Using a mixed methods approach including social network surveys, semi-structured interviews, and geospatial data, this article compares social capital indicators and socio-ecological interactions for rural households with different levels of encroachment due to forest plantations. The research objective is to contrast diverse socio-environmental scenarios with different levels of dispersion and proximity to forest plantations. Findings on local egocentric networks propose clues about the social effects of traditional agriculture loss, rural depopulation and other socio-economic and ecological issues which respondents associated with the introduction and expansion of monoculture plantations in the region.																			1037-1656	2204-0536				2023 SEP 2	2023										10.1080/10371656.2023.2270849	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10371656.2023.2270849		SEP 2023											WOS:001087387100001

Based on a long-term field experiment involving three N rates (0 (N0), 160 (N160), and 320 (N320) kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), we measured nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from wheat fields and determined the soil organic carbon (SOC), total N, microbial biomass C (MBC), and N (MBN), mineralized C (C-min) and N (N-min) concentrations and the bacterial community composition. The results showed that N fertilization significantly (P < 0.05) increased N2O and CO2 emissions. N fertilization also significantly (P < 0.05) increased SOC by 13.2%, total N by 7.4%, MBN by 34.3%, C-min by 15.5%, and N-min by 27.8%, as well as the soil bacterial diversity and abundances of N cycling functional groups (by 149%). Additionally, N2O and CO2 emissions were positively and linearly correlated with NH4-N and NO3-N concentrations and positively correlated with SOC, total N, MBN, and the number of bacterial species, as well as most of the bacterial phyla and functional groups. These results suggest that N fertilizer applied to the dryland soils improved soil fertility and changed the soil bacterial community composition and function, thus increased N2O and CO2 emissions. Therefore, to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and maintain soil fertility for wheat production, an optimized N fertilizer rate should be applied in the southern region of the Loess Plateau in China.

The 6 yr effect of straw mulching (SM), plastic film mulching (PM), and no mulching (CK) on soil aggregation and associated C and N concentrations at 0-20 and 20-40 cm soil layers were studied under dryland winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and spring corn (Zea mays L.) in the Loess Plateau of China. Regardless of crop types, aggregate proportion was greater in macroaggregates (2.00-10.00 mm), but lower in microaggregates (<0.50 mm) with mulching than without in both soil layers. The mean weight diameter of aggregates was greater with SM and PM than CK. Compared with CK and PM, SM increased soil organic C (SOC) and total N (STN) concentrations in both macroaggregates and bulk soil at 0-20 cm. Aggregate proportion and soil C and N concentrations at both depths were more pronounced in winter wheat than spring corn. The recovery rates of bulk soil SOC and STN in aggregates varied from 94% to 107%. Straw and plastic film mulching enhanced soil aggregation compared with no mulching. Straw mulching was more effective in increasing SOC and STN concentrations at the surface layer in dryland winter wheat and spring corn.																			0008-4271	1918-1841				DEC	2019	99	4					367	379		10.1139/cjss-2019-0015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjss-2019-0015													WOS:000500183800002

Seed germination and dormancy traits of forbs and shrubs important for restoration of North American dryland ecosystems	PLANT BIOLOGY					International Symposium of the NAtive Seed Science, TEchnology and Conservation (NAS-STEC)	SEP, 2017	Royal Botan Gardens, Kew, ENGLAND	NAt Seed Sci TEchnol & Conserv	Royal Botan Gardens			In degraded dryland systems, native plant community re-establishment following disturbance is almost exclusively carried out using seeds, but these efforts commonly fail. Much of this failure can be attributed to the limited understanding of seed dormancy and germination traits. We undertook a systematic classification of seed dormancy of 26 species of annual and perennial forbs and shrubs that represent key, dominant genera used in restoration of the Great Basin ecosystem in the western United States. We examined germination across a wide thermal profile to depict species-specific characteristics and assessed the potential of gibberellic acid (GA(3)) and karrikinolide (KAR(1)) to expand the thermal germination envelope of fresh seeds. Of the tested species, 81% produce seeds that are dormant at maturity. The largest proportion (62%) exhibited physiological (PD), followed by physical (PY, 8%), combinational (PY + PD, 8%) and morphophysiological (MPD, 4%) dormancy classes. The effects of chemical stimulants were temperature- and species-mediated. In general, mean germination across the thermal profile was improved by GA(3) and KAR(1) for 11 and five species, respectively. We detected a strong germination response to temperature in freshly collected seeds of 20 species. Temperatures below 10 degrees C limited the germination of all except Agoseris heterophylla, suggesting that in their dormant state, the majority of these species are thermally restricted. Our findings demonstrate the utility of dormancy classification as a foundation for understanding the critical regenerative traits in these ecologically important species and highlight its importance in restoration planning.

J	Zeng, ZW; Zhu, HT				Zeng, Zhiwei; Zhu, Hongtao			Modern Dryland Source-to-Sink System Segments and Coupling Relationships from Digital Elevation Model Analysis: A Case Study from the Mongolian Altai	REMOTE SENSING												Source-to-sink (S2S) systems have represented a major area of research in recent years; however, few modern S2S system analyses have been applied to typical dryland uplifts/mountains. A modern lacustrine sedimentary system is widely developed in the Great Lakes Basin of western Mongolia, and the Jargalant Nuruu in the Mongolian Altai is a suitable natural laboratory for modern dryland S2S system analysis. In this study, the multi-order S2S system of the Jargalant Nuruu was applied based on a digital elevation model (DEM) and Google Earth database analysis. The Jargalant Nuruu system is subdivided into three second-order sub-S2S systems of the eastern, western, and southern parts (S2S-E, S2S-W, and S2S-S, respectively) and 35 third-order sub-S2S systems (E1-E18, W1-W9, and S1-S8) according to the slope gradients, altitude, and hydrographic net of the Jargalant Nuruu recognized by DEM data, integrated with the quantitative recognition of the topographic drainage divide and structural patterns of the uplift margin. The three second-order S2S systems correspond to three various S2S system coupling models. The S2S-E is characterized by a steep slope gradient system (average 15.61 degrees) with small-scale dominantly alluvial fan deposits (average 4.56 km(2)). S2S-W is represented by a gentle slope gradient system (average 10.24 degrees) with large-scale dominated fan-shaped lobes (average 30.04 km(2)). S2S-S, in contrast, is a transformation zone system with transitional features between the two former types. Four major potential controlling factors for the difference in sub-S2S systems are summarized here, including tectonic activity, bedrock properties in the source area, morphology from source to sink, and climatic conditions. The landforms, sedimentary characteristics, and their differences in these sub-S2S systems are the result of the comprehensive influence and control of these multiple factors. This case study could serve as a useful reference for characterizing the sedimentary features of a modern or even ancient S2S system in other regions.

Invasive annual grass interacts with drought to influence plant communities and soil moisture in dryland restoration	ECOSPHERE												Understanding the combined effects of drought and invasive species on plant community development and soil moisture could provide valuable insight into the mechanisms hindering successful native plant establishment in dryland restoration projects. We implemented a re-vegetation experiment at two sites in Colorado, USA (one each in the Western Great Plains and Cold Desert ecoregions) to investigate the effects of drought (66% reduction of ambient growing season rainfall), non-native Bromus tectorum seed addition (465 seeds/m(2)), and superabsorbent polymer soil amendment (25 g/m(2)) on plant community development and soil volumetric water content at 5 and 30 cm depth. Drought resulted in higher B. tectorum cover at the Western Great Plains site but lower B. tectorum cover at the Cold Desert site. These contrasting results suggest drought may interact with site-specific precipitation patterns to influence B. tectorum establishment. At the Western Great Plains site, drought reduced seeded forb cover and B. tectorum seed addition reduced seeded grass cover, highlighting how the effects of drought and invasive species may vary depending on which functional group is assessed. At the Cold Desert site, drought and B. tectorum seed addition each decreased seeded species cover from approximately 8% to 3%. Superabsorbent polymer effects were limited to slight increases in overall seeded grass cover at the Western Great Plains site from 2.2% to 4.9%. Both drought and B. tectorum seed addition reduced soil volumetric water content but in some cases effects depended on interactions between the two treatments, site, or soil depth. Notably, at the Cold Desert site the reduction in soil volumetric water content resulting from B. tectorum seed addition with ambient precipitation exceeded that of the drought treatment alone at 5 and 30 cm depth. Our results demonstrate that drought and invasive species both negatively influence native plant establishment and soil moisture, and in some cases may interact. Considering both abiotic and biotic stressors as well as their interactions in restoration planning could improve our understanding of native plant establishment and improve re-vegetation outcomes.

Soil water availability shapes species richness in mid-latitude shrub steppe plant communities	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions Ecological communities are controlled by multiple, interacting abiotic and biotic factors that influence the distribution, abundance, and diversity of species. These processes jointly determine resource availability, resource competition, and ultimately species richness. For many terrestrial ecosystems in dryland climates, soil water availability is the most frequent limiting resource for plant species. We used field sampling coupled with process-based soil water balance modeling to explore the relative importance of multiple macroclimatic, ecohydrological, and biotic variables on plant species and functional type richness at the landscape scale in dryland plant communities. Location Dryland plant communities dominated by big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) that span climatic and elevational gradients in Wyoming, USA. Methods We quantified species richness at 1,000 m(2) and used multiple regression to determine whether mean climatic conditions, multiple metrics of soil moisture from a soil water balance model (SOILWAT2), soil physical and chemical properties, and shrub stand structure (biotic) variables were related to species and functional type richness. Results Species richness varied between 16 and 54 across sites. We found that species and functional type richness were related to both macroclimate and ecohydrology, but ecohydrology explained slightly more variation than climate. Biotic variables were always secondary to macroclimate and ecohydrology in our models. Variance partitioning revealed that large portions of variability in species (similar to 54%), forb (similar to 47%), and grass (similar to 40%) richness were explained by ecohydrological variables. Conclusions Our results highlight the importance of the spatial and temporal distribution of soil water for dryland plant species richness and suggest that documenting the ways in which climate, vegetation, and soil properties interact to determine soil water availability is critical for understanding biodiversity patterns in dryland plant communities. This work has relevance for other mid-latitude, shrub-dominated dryland plant communities where soil water availability strongly influences ecosystem structure and function.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate long-term effects of conservation tillage on soil characteristics and prospects of cropping intensification in a subtropical dryland. This two-year field study was carried out in the plots of an established long-term field experiment (initiated in 2011) where four tillage systems were compared viz., conventional tillage (CT, moldboard), minimum tillage (MT), reduced tillage (RT) and zero tillage (ZT). Each tillage plot was split into three subplots for crop sequences viz., fallow-wheat (Triticum aestivum) (F-W), mung bean (Vigna radiata) green manure-wheat (M-W) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) fodder-wheat (S-W). Under all crop sequences soil profile water content (0-90 cm) was the highest in RT tillage plots (19%) and the lowest in ZT plots (13%). Both RT and ZT significantly increased water stable aggregates in soil (35%) compared with CT (22%). However, ZT had the highest bulk density that was on average 1.53 Mg ha(-1) compared to 1.45 Mg ha(-1) under CT. In summer, RT tillage produced higher biomass yield of sorghum and mung bean than other tillage systems. In winter, RT produced the highest wheat grain yield, which was 2.89 and 2.84 t ha(-1) in 2016, and 2.63 and 2.61 t ha(-1) in 2017 especially in F-W and M-W systems, respectively. Moreover, DSSAT model also confirmed increase in biomass and grain yields of wheat with long-term application of RT practices. In conclusion, reduced tillage strategy should be implemented to avoid soil deterioration and enhance crop productivity in subtropical drylands.

J	Ben Mhenni, N; Shinoda, M; Nandintsetseg, B				Ben Mhenni, Nada; Shinoda, Masato; Nandintsetseg, Banzragch			Assessment of drought frequency, severity, and duration and its impacts on vegetation greenness and agriculture production in Mediterranean dryland: A case study in Tunisia	NATURAL HAZARDS												Drought is among the highest-impact natural hazards affecting drylands around the world in a warming climate. The Mediterranean region, including Tunisia, is projected to experience the most predominant drying trends worldwide. However, a detailed regional scale study of drought for Tunisia has been limited, hampering an assessment of drought impact on the ecosystem and society. This study explored drought characteristics and its effect on vegetation greenness and agricultural productivity in three vegetation zones of Tunisia during 1982-2011, taking advantage of both meteorological and soil moisture drought indices and identifying the most appropriate index for each zone. The results revealed that meteorological droughts were short and frequent, triggering soil moisture droughts that were long-lasting and intense. The standardized precipitation index was identified as the best indicator of vegetation and agricultural droughts in the Northern forest, while the Palmer Drought Severity Index was best in the Central steppe and Southern desert (no crop data in the Southern desert). The lag-correlation analysis revealed that the response of both vegetation greenness and wheat productivity to droughts was more pronounced and had a longer significant lag in the Central steppe than in the other regions. These results suggest that arable land species (Central steppe and Southern desert), characterized by shallow roots, have a rapid response to rainfall variability when compared with forest species (Northern forest), which have deep roots allowing them an adequate supply of moisture. The region-specific indices identified here will provide a useful measure for drought monitoring and mitigation in Tunisia.

The dryland potential is optimally utilized using biofertilizers that can produce microbes to increase soil fertility. This research aims to determine the effects of biofertilizers on dryland improvement and crop production. The study was conducted from February to May 2021 in Central Java, Indonesia. Using a randomized block design in peanut cultivation. Six biofertilizers (Controlled, Agrimeth, BioNutrient, Gliocompost, Agrimeth + BioNutrient, Agrimeth + BioNutrient + Gliocompost) were applied with four replications. The performance of each biofertilizer was assessed based on chemical soil parameters, soil microbe population, plant growth, and yields. The soil in the study area belonged to the Inceptisols group and exhibited moderately acidic pH, low organic carbon content, and low nitrogen levels. However, it had high potential and available phosphorus, as well as moderate potential and high available potassium. BioNutrient and Gliocompost increased available phosphate by 12 and 19%, respectively, due to the presence of Pseudomonas fluorescens and Aspergillus sp. Agrimeth influenced the population of Azospirillum (45-63%) and enhanced phosphate-solubilizing bacteria. Agrimeth + BioNutrient + Gliocompost promoted the growth of the Azospirillum and Trichoderma populations (17-18%), resulting in a 45.04% increase in profits. Biofertilizer inoculation positively affected peanut development, root nodule formation, and yield. This novelty showed the potential of biofertilizers in improving dryland conditions, increasing crop productivity, and contributing to sustainable agriculture in the long term.

It is not clear whether the reduction in aboveground growth is associated with increased or decreased root growth and carbon allocation. Using genotypes of wheat released over the last 125 years, we evaluated the changes in belowground biomass, structure and activity as the grain yield increased with modern genotypes. Fourteen spring wheat genotypes released in different eras were selected to study the relationships between root traits and grain yield in two dryland environments in northwest China. In the field, root biomass, root-to-shoot ratio, and root length density decreased, while specific root length and water uptake per unit root biomass increased as the grain yield increased in later-released genotypes. Leaf C-13 pulse labeling was applied to six representative genotypes at the stem elongation and early grain-filling stages to measure the distribution of assimilated carbon between shoots, roots, the root rhizosphere, and losses by root respiration. The labeling with C-13 showed that at stem elongation and early grain filling, the proportion of C-13-labeled dry matter allocated to aboveground biomass increased, and that allocated to roots decreased as grain yield increased with the later release of the genotypes. At stem elongation, across all genotypes 55% (genotypic range 46-66%) of the C-13 was in the shoot biomass and 19% (13-25%) was used to build root biomass, while 16% (13-19%) was lost as root and soil respiration and 10% (8-11%) was in the root rhizosphere. At the grain filling stage, 75% (68-80%) of the C-13 was in the shoots, 7% (5-9%) was in the roots, 12% (9-15%) was used for root and soil respiration, and 6% (5-7%) was in the root rhizosphere. In the modern high-yielding genotypes, a lower percentage of C-13 was translocated to the roots, secreted into the rhizosphere and lost by root respiration than in the landraces. While crop breeders do not actively select and breed for root characteristics, we conclude that breeding and selection for higher-yielding genotypes of spring wheat in northwest China has inadvertently selected for smaller but more efficient root systems that have contributed to higher grain yield in the rainfed environment of the study region. The implications of this biomass distribution for grain yield in other dryland environments are discussed.

However, the strong coupling of SM and VPD makes it difficult to quantify their relative importance in the ecosystem carbon cycle. In this study we decoupled the negative correlation between SM and VPD by sorting and binning reanalysed SM and VPD data, and based on this, we quantified the relationship between VPD and SM and sunlight-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) in dryland Central Asia (CA). We found that SM promoted and suppressed photosynthesis in CA, accounting for 94.08% and 5.92% of the vegetated areas in CA, respectively; VPD promoted and suppressed photosynthesis in CA accounted for 39.68% and 60.32% of the vegetation area, respectively. The effects of SM and VPD on the photosynthesis of different vegetation types were different: the photosynthesis of croplands and forests tended to increase and then decrease with increasing SM, and the photosynthesis of grasslands, shrublands and sparse vegetation tended to increase with increasing SM; the photosynthesis of croplands, grasslands and forests increase with VPD, while the opposite is true for shrublands and sparse vegetation. Relative effects on photosynthesis indicated that the areas where SM had a greater effect than VPD on photosynthesis accounted for 74.26% of the vegetation area, mainly in the central part of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, which was related to the fact that the main vegetation types in these regions were croplands, grasslands, forests and sparse vegetation. The areas with greater effects of VPD than SM on photo-synthesis were mainly located in the northern part of Kazakhstan and most of Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan (25.74% of vegetated areas). Our study contributes to further understanding of the key processes involved in carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems.

J	Sadono, R; Wardhana, W; Idris, F; Wirabuana, PYAP				Sadono, Ronggo; Wardhana, Wahyu; Idris, Fahmi; Wirabuana, Pandu Yudha Adi Putra			Allometric Equation for Estimating Energy Production of <i>Eucalyptus urophylla</i> in Dryland Ecosystems at East Nusa Tenggara	JURNAL MANAJEMEN HUTAN TROPIKA												A precise and accurate energy production quantification, particularly at the individual tree level is needed to understand the potential contribution of eucalyptus plantations to renewable energy development. However, measuring energy storage with a destructive method is inefficient because it requires a large amount of resources. The development of allometric equations is a realistic solution to solve this problem as it facilitates the efficient estimation of energy production from trees. Therefore, this study aims to develop an allometric equation for estimating the energy production of Eucalyptus urophylla in dryland ecosystems in East Nusa Tenggara. The destructive sampling was carried out on 25 sample trees which are evenly distributedfrom small to large dimensions, while the calorific value of each tree component was analyzed using the bomb calorimeter method. Furthermore, the energy production of each tree was counted by multiplying the calorific value with the total biomass accumulation. To develop an allometric equation, the analysis of regression was applied using several independent variables, such as diameter at breast height (D), combined squared diameter of breast and tree height ((DH)-H-3), as well as D and H separately. The results showed that the energy production of E. urophylla at the study site varied from 252.56 to 7,813.30 MI tree(-1) with more than 90% accumulated in the stem, followed by foliage (4.62%) and branches (4.05%). The higher the tree dimension, the greater the energy production. Moreover, the equation ln (Y) over cap = lna + b.lnD + c.lnH was the best allometric model to estimate energy production with an accuracy of 95.2%. Based on the results, the allometric equation provides an accurate estimation of energy production in E. urophylla.

How global drylands extent and climate changed is not clear, and the dominant factor is the dispute over enhanced air evaporative demand and insufficient precipitation. This study attempted to fill this gap by exploring the trends in dryland areas, aridity index (AI), precipitation (P), and potential evapotranspiration (PET), and quantifying the temporal contributions of P and PET to AI. The results showed that the total dryland area shrunk 0.71 x 10(6) km(2) during 1901-2017 with reversed trend of shrinking to expanding. Precipitation dominates aridity in 88% of drylands, except for some regions in Europe and East Asia. With global warming, the relative contribution of PET to aridity in drylands increased significantly with a rate of 0.07% per year. The effect of PET exceeded that of P in 1966, which was the reason for the trend reversals of average AI.

Productivity and water use efficiency of intensified dryland cropping systems under low precipitation in Pacific Northwest, USA	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												A lack of plant available water limits the ability to intensify the summer fallow-winter wheat (SF-WW) rotation in low precipitation (<350 mm) areas of the inland Pacific Northwest (PNW). The objective of this study was to compare crop yield, water use efficiency, precipitation capture, and soil water storage between conventional-tillage SF and reduced tillage fallow (RTF) and among different 2-yr and 3-yr cropping sequences. After full initiation of the experiment, eight sequences were evaluated over a 3-yr period (2016-18) including SF-WW, RTF-WW, RTF-WW-spring barley (SB), RTF-winter napus canola (WN)-spring wheat (SW), RTF-spring carinata (SC)-SW, RTF-WN-spring forage triticale (ST), and RTF-winter forage triticale (WT)-SC. Growing season precipitation was near average (269 mm) each year. Ponded infiltration rates were significantly higher (P <= 0.05) in 2-yr rotations managed with RTF (77.68 +/- 24.56 mm h(-1)) than SF (37.08 +/- 13.03 mm h(-1)). Water use efficiency and yields of WW were generally greater following RTF than for WW after SF. Water use and yield of winter cereals WW and WT after fallow were greater than for oilseeds WN and SC that also followed fallow. Pre-plant soil water contents were significantly lower following a primary crop than after fallow. Consequently, water use and yield of secondary crops were <50 % of primary crops. Of 3-yr cropping sequences, RTF-WW-SB and RTF-WW-SC had the highest water use efficiencies with annualized yields generally approaching that of RTF-WW and SF-WW. These results support integration of spring barley and spring carinata under low precipitation dryland conditions in the PNW to increase diversification and improve conservation of water.																			0378-4290	1872-6852				SEP 1	2020	254								107787	10.1016/j.fcr.2020.107787	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2020.107787													WOS:000542185300003

Topographic, Hydraulic, and Vegetative Controls on Bar and Island Development in Mixed Bedrock-Alluvial, Multichanneled, Dryland Rivers	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												We investigate processes of bedrock-core bar and island development in a bedrock-influenced anastomosed reach of the Sabie River, Kruger National Park, eastern South Africa. For sites subject to alluvial stripping during an extreme flood event (similar to 4,470-5,630 m(3) s(-1)) in 2012, preflood and postflood aerial photographs and LiDAR data, 2-D morphodynamic simulations, and field observations reveal that the thickest surviving alluvial deposits tend to be located over bedrock topographic lows. At a simulated peak discharge (similar to 4,500 m(3) s(-1)), most sediment (sand, fine gravel) is mobile but localized deposition on bedrock topographic highs is possible. At lower simulated discharges (<1,000 m(3) s(-1)), topographic highs are not submerged, and deposition occurs in lower elevation areas, particularly in areas disconnected from the main channels during falling stage. Field observations suggest that in addition to discharge, rainwash between floods may redistribute sediments from bedrock topographic highs to lower elevation areas, and also highlight the critical role of vegetation colonization in bar stability, and in trapping of additional sediment and organics. These findings challenge the assumptions of preferential deposition on topographic highs that underpin previous analyses of Kruger National Park river dynamics, and are synthesized in a new conceptual model that demonstrates how initial bedrock topographic lows become topographic highs (bedrock-core bars and islands) in the latter stages of sediment accumulation. The model provides particular insight into the development of mixed bedrock-alluvial anastomosing along the Kruger National Park rivers, but similar processes of bar/island development likely occur along numerous other bedrock-influenced rivers across dryland southern Africa and farther afield.

Chemical Amendments of Dryland Saline-Sodic Soils Did Not Enhance Productivity and Soil Health in Fields without Effective Drainage	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												A common restoration treatment for saline-sodic soils involves improving soil drainage, applying soil amendments (e.g., CaSO4, CaCl2, or elemental S), and leaching with water that has a relatively low electrical conductivity. However, due to high subsoil bulk densities and low drainable porosities, these treatments many not be effective in glaciated dryland systems. A 3-yr field study conducted in three model systems determined the impact of chemical amendments (none, CaCl2, CaSO4, and elemental S) on plant growth, microbial composition, temporal changes in electrical conductivity (ECe), and the relative sodium content (% Na). Chemical amendments (i) either reduced or did not increase maize (Zea mays), soybean (Glycine max), and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) yields; (ii) did not increase water infiltration or microbial biomass as determined using the phospholipid-derived fatty acid (PLFA) technique; and (iii) did not reduce ECe or % Na. These results were attributed to high bulk densities and low drainable porosities that reducing the drainage effectiveness in the model backslope and footslope soils, the presence of subsurface marine sediments that provided a source for sodium and other salts that could be transported through capillary action to the surface soil, high sulfate and gypsum contents in the surface soil, and relatively low microbial biomass values. The results suggests that an alternative multistep saline sodic soil restoration approach that involves increasing exchangeable Ca+2 through enhanced microbial and root respiration and increasing transpiration and soil drainage by seeding full season deep rooted perennial vegetation should be tested.

The strains were isolated from a dryland agricultural soil in southern Spain where no record of legume cultivation is available, thus we propose the name Neorhizobium tomejilense sp. nov. (type strain T17_20(T), LMG 30623(T) and CECT 9621(T)). N. tomejilense exhibit a clear distinct lineage from the other Neorhizobium species, Neorhizobium galegae, Neorhizobium alkalisoli and Neorhizobium huautlense, based on polyphasic evidence. Phylogenetic marker analysis of 16S rDNA, atpD, glnll, recA, rpoB and thrC genes and genomic identity data derived from the draft genomic sequences showed that N. tomejilense strains clearly separated from the other Neorhizobium species and that N. galegae represents the closest species, with Average Nucleotide Identities (ANIb) ranging from 90% (for type strain HAMBI 540(T)) to just under 95.0% (for two N. galegae sv. officinalis strains). Genomes from N. galegae and N. tomejilense, however, clearly differed in important traits, such as the number of rRNA operon copies or the number of tRNAs. Phenotypic characterisation of N. tomejilense also displayed differences with the other Neorhizobium species. Whole-cell matrix-assisted laser-desorption time-offlight mass spectrometry (WC MALDI-TOF-MS) fingerprint analysis and the dendrogram derived from the fingerprint profiles, showed a clearly distinct group formed by the three N. tomejilense isolates (T17_20(T), T20_22 and T11_12) from the other Neorhizobium especies.

J	Alon, M; Dovrat, G; Masci, T; Sheffer, E				Alon, Moshe; Dovrat, Guy; Masci, Tania; Sheffer, Efrat			Soil nitrogen regulates symbiotic nitrogen fixation in a legume shrub but does not accumulate under it	ECOSPHERE												Legumes in dryland ecosystems face the challenge of maintaining energetically costly symbiosis with N-2-fixing rhizobia, in a water- and nutrient-limited environment. Controlled experiments showed a strong reduction in symbiotic N-2 fixation in response to elevated levels of nitrogen availability, but this regulation of N-2 fixation was not found in dryland field settings. Here, we ask whether regulation of N-2 fixation occurs in the field and what are the possible consequences for dryland soil nitrogen. We measured plant investment in root nodules and rates of bacterial activity, in seedlings and adults of a common N-2-fixing shrub, Calicotome villosa, in five field sites naturally varying in soil nitrogen and phosphorus availabilities. Additionally, we measured nitrogen concentrations and availabilities in the soil under C. villosa and a reference non-fixing shrub. Biomass investment in root nodules was significantly reduced in response to elevated levels of soil nitrate in adult shrubs, but no such effect was found for seedlings. Soil nitrogen concentration under C. villosa shrubs was low compared to the soil under a non-fixing reference shrub. We provide evidence that symbiotic N-2-fixing plants in drylands tightly regulate their investment in symbiotic N-2 fixation, therefore controlling nitrogen inputs into the soil. These findings challenge the long-held notion that the growth of N-2-fixing plants necessarily leads to the accumulation of soil nitrogen in their surroundings over time.

Biotic vs abiotic controls on temporal sensitivity of primary production to precipitation across North American drylands	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												Dryland net primary productivity (NPP) is sensitive to temporal variation in precipitation (PPT), but the magnitude of this 'temporal sensitivity' varies spatially. Hypotheses for spatial variation in temporal sensitivity have often emphasized abiotic factors, such as moisture limitation, while overlooking biotic factors, such as vegetation structure. We tested these hypotheses using spatiotemporal models fit to remote-sensing data sets to assess how vegetation structure and climate influence temporal sensitivity across five dryland ecoregions of the western USA. Temporal sensitivity was higher in locations and ecoregions dominated by herbaceous vegetation. By contrast, much less spatial variation in temporal sensitivity was explained by mean annual PPT. In fact, ecoregion-specific models showed inconsistent associations of sensitivity and PPT; whereas sensitivity decreased with increasing mean annual PPT in most ecoregions, it increased with mean annual PPT in the most arid ecoregion, the hot deserts. The strong, positive influence of herbaceous vegetation on temporal sensitivity indicates that herbaceous-dominated drylands will be particularly sensitive to future increases in precipitation variability and that dramatic changes in cover type caused by invasions or shrub encroachment will lead to changes in dryland NPP dynamics, perhaps independent of changes in precipitation.

The environmental implications of upper Paleozoic plant-fossil assemblages with mixtures of wetland and drought-tolerant taxa in tropical Pangea	GEOBIOS												We evaluate the influences of elevation and climate on the spatio-temporal distribution of wetland and dryland biomes during the Pennsylvanian and early Permian in tropical Pangea. The longstanding "upland model" places drought-tolerant vegetation in elevated habitats, where slope and drainage created moisture-limited substrates under a humid climate that simultaneously promoted peat accumulation in contemporaneous lowlands. Upland plants were periodically transported to, and buried in, lowlands. Rare preservation of dryland vegetation thus reflects its general absence in basins, and taphonomic vagaries of long-distance transport. The alternative "climate model" proposes that drought-tolerant plants dominated tropical habitats when climate was seasonally dry, with wetland vegetation reduced to scattered refugia. Environmental changes attending glacial-interglacial cycles caused alternating wetter-drier conditions, and the relative abundance of wetland versus dryland biomes in basinal lowlands thus varied with climatic oscillations. The paucity of drought-tolerant plants reflects a preservational megabias against habitats with seasonal moisture deficits. The environmental signal of "mixed" plant-fossil assemblages, comprising taxa characteristic of both wetland and dryland biomes, may help resolve these debates. We review key Pennsylvanian and lower Permian mixed assemblages from tropical Euramerican Pangea, and interpret their original habitats and climatic contexts based on multidisciplinary lines of evidence, including sedimentology, taphonomy, physiology, and paleoecology. Evaluations also consider patterns of vegetational distribution and taphonomy in modern tropical environments. We suggest that even a cursory view of current tropical plant distribution exposes flaws in the upland model. Where tropical climate is sufficiently humid to support peat swamps, slopes and elevated habitats do not host drought-tolerant vegetation, but are occupied by plants similar to those in lowland settings. This occurs because equable, high precipitation strongly dampens water-table variation across entire landscapes. Furthermore, taphonomic studies indicate that most plant-fossil assemblages record vegetation living near the burial site. Fossil floras thus reflect environmental conditions near their growth site, excluding an upland origin for most occurrences of droughttolerant taxa. Conversely, the climate model is consistent with modern tropical vegetational distribution and soundly explains late Paleozoic floristic patterns. When Pangean tropical lowlands experienced seasonally dry conditions, plants tolerant of moisture deficits dominated most habitats, whereas wetland vegetation was restricted to wetter sites with greater preservation potential. This occurred because topographic variations are magnified under seasonal precipitation regimes, creating a complex habitat mosaic with wetland patches in a landscape subject to seasonal drought. Accordingly, we propose that a macrofloral assemblage with even rare drought-tolerant taxa indicates seasonality in the broader landscape. At larger spatio-temporal scales, disagreement also persists about whether tectonic uplift or long-term climatic drying was the primary driver of changes in late Paleozoic floristic patterns and areal extent of tropical peat swamps. We argue that tectonic activity alone cannot explain the drastic reduction in peat swamps or coincident changes in dominance-diversity of wetland vegetation. Rates of plant dispersal and evolution far outpace that of mountain building, and peat-forming wetlands persisted in elevated habitats well into the Late Pennsylvanian. Therefore, progressive late Paleozoic aridification was the most probable driver of changing floral patterns and the distribution of wetland and dryland biomes in tropical Pangea.

Among them, carbon storage is one of the most important. However, grasslands are increasingly threatened by drought and overgrazing which might negatively affect soil carbon stocks. Despite this threat, there is a dearth of information on how drought and grazing jointly impact soil carbon stocks and CO2 fluxes in dryland grasslands. With the aid of a large field experiment, we studied the combined effects of a 5-year extreme drought and moderate grazing on soil carbon stocks, CO2 fluxes and soil chemical properties. Extreme drought was induced by reducing ambient rainfall by 66% using large rainout shelters. We found CO2 fluxes to strongly respond to the 5-year experimental drought. Extreme drought reduced CO2 emission rates by 32% compared to ambient conditions. CO2 fluxes averaged 5.7 mg m(-2)min(-1) under drought compared to 8.3 mg m(-2) min(-1) under ambient conditions. CO2 fluxes were, however, not influenced by grazing. At the end of the growth period, grazed plots under ambient rainfall had released 16.3 tons of CO2 ha(-1) which was 58% higher than observed on grazed plots subjected to severe drought. Soil carbon stocks were higher under drought conditions due to slower decomposition rates. Drought resulted in increased concentrations of primary macronutrients (N, P, and K), micronutrients (Zn and Mn) and pH in the top 30 cm of the soil relative to ambient conditions. The results also showed that grazing reduced the concentration of N and P in the topsoil compared to the ungrazed plots. This study provided insights on the soil carbon storage, CO2 emission rates and nutrient dynamics in a semi-arid dryland grassland as influenced by both drought and grazing. Our study also revealed that long-term extreme drought may be favorable in terms of preserving the existing soil carbon stocks through reduced CO2 release. This finding is critical for understanding future soil carbon dynamics in dryland grasslands in the face of climate change.

These systems have temporal and spatial variability of pasture quality resulting from the diversity of soil fertility and pasture floristic composition, the interaction with trees, animal grazing, and a Mediterranean climate characterized by accentuated seasonality and interannual irregularity. Grazing management decisions are dependent on assessing pasture availability and quality. Conventional analytical determination of crude protein (CP) and fiber (neutral detergent fiber, NDF) by reference laboratory methods require laborious and expensive procedures and, thus, do not meet the needs of the current animal production systems. The aim of this study was to evaluate two alternative approaches to estimate pasture CP and NDF, namely one based on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined with multivariate data analysis and the other based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) measured in the field by a proximal active optical sensor (AOS). A total of 232 pasture samples were collected from January to June 2020 in eight fields. Of these, 96 samples were processed in fresh form using NIRS. All 232 samples were dried and subjected to reference laboratory and NIRS analysis. For NIRS, fresh and dry samples were split in two sets: a calibration set with half of the samples and an external validation set with the remaining half of the samples. The results of this study showed significant correlation between NIRS calibration models and reference methods for quantifying pasture quality parameters, with greater accuracy in dry samples (R-2 = 0.936 and RPD = 4.01 for CP and R-2 = 0.914 and RPD = 3.48 for NDF) than fresh samples (R-2 = 0.702 and RPD = 1.88 for CP and R-2 = 0.720 and RPD = 2.38 for NDF). The NDVI measured by the AOS shows a similar coefficient of determination to the NIRS approach with pasture fresh samples (R-2 = 0.707 for CP and R-2 = 0.648 for NDF). The results demonstrate the potential of these technologies for estimating CP and NDF in pastures, which can facilitate the farm manager's decision making in terms of the dynamic management of animal grazing and supplementation needs.

J	Tulbure, MG; Broich, M				Tulbure, Mirela G.; Broich, Mark			Spatiotemporal patterns and effects of climate and land use on surface water extent dynamics in a dryland region with three decades of Landsat satellite data	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Spatiotemporal distribution and systematic quantification of surface water and their drivers of change are critical. However, quantifying this distribution is challenging due to a lack of spatially explicit and temporally dynamic empirical data of both surface water and is drivers of change at large spatial scales. We focused on one of the largest dryland basins in the world, Australia's Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), recently identified as a global hotspot. of water decline. We used a new remotely sensed time-series of surface water extent dynamics (SWD) data to quantify spatiotemporal patterns in surface water across the entire MDB and catchments and to assess natural and anthropogenic drivers of SWD including climate and historical land use change. We show high intra- and inter-annual dynamics in surface water with a rapid loss during the Millennium Drought, the worst, decade-long drought in SE Australia. We show strong regional and catchment differences in SWD with the northern basin showing high variability compared to the southern basin which shows a steady decline in surface water. Linear mixed effect models including climate and land-use change variables explained up to 70% variability in SWD with climate being more important in catchments of the northwestern MDB, whereas land-use was important primarily in the central MDB. Increase in fraction of dryland agriculture in a catchment and maximum temperature was negatively related to SWD, whereas precipitation and soil moisture were positively related to SWD. The tact that land-use change was an important explanatory variable of SWD in addition to climate is a significant result as land-use can be managed more effectively whereas climate-mitigation actions can be intractable, with global change scenarios predicting drier conditions for the area followed by a further reduction in surface water availability.

J	Huang, MT; Zhai, PM				Huang, Meng-Tian; Zhai, Pan-Mao			Desertification dynamics in China's drylands under climate change	ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH												Much of drylands has been hit by land degradation during the recent decades. But whether and how desertification is related to climate change is poorly understood. Here, using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series and climatic variables, we assessed the desertification dynamics over China's drylands from 1982 to 2016 and explored the climate change impacts, with a particular focus on the influence of the 2015/2016 El Nino event. We found a fluctuant downward trend of barren land area from 1982 to the early 2010s, but followed by a sharp increase afterwards. Decrease in precipitation combined with high temperature are major contributors to the barren land expansion. During the 2015/2016 El Nino, the concurrence of severe drought and heat stress gave rise to the most serious land desertification in the record. Hyper-arid and arid drylands are the predominant contributors to the abrupt barren land area increase during 2015/2016. Our findings, therefore, highlight the climate change impacts on dryland desertification processes. Future dryland expansion and accompanying drought stress may exacerbate the risk of land degradation in these regions.

Subsequently, limited data in the sub-Saharan region impedes the formulation of policies on GHG mitigation and adaptation. Therefore, the need to study effluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) was salient. The objective of the study was to assess GHG effluxes across seasons in conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) systems under nitrogen (N) fertilizer management. Gases were sampled using static PVC chambers and sampling was done by inserting a 25-mL polypropylene syringe into the chamber septa and slowly removing the gas. Samples were analysed for CO2, CH4 and N2O using gas chromatography. In winter, CH4 effluxes were higher under NT than CT for each application rate (p < 0.05). N2O efflux was higher (p < 0.05) under CT at 120 and 240 kg N ha(-1) compared to NT in summer. The CO2 effluxes of CT were higher (p < 0.05) than NT at all N application rates and seasons. Higher GHG effluxes in summer than winter was attributed to higher soil temperature and moisture. CO2 and N2O emissions were positively correlated to tillage with CH4 negatively correlated, but it has to be noted that not only the intensity of tillage influenced effluxes, but also climatic conditions played a huge role in determining the direction of effluxes. Conservation tillage is climate smart and, in this case NT at 120 kg N ha(-1), can be recommended because it sustained less effluxes especially during summer.

Iron/manganese oxide-based amendments have been widely applied to remediate heavy metal polluted paddy soils. However, little is known about the performance and mechanism of single iron/ manganese oxides and iron-manganese composite oxides in reducing Cd accumulation in wheat plants from dryland soils. Here, iron oxide (alpha-FeOOH), manganese oxide (delta-MnO2) and iron-manganese composite oxides (birnessite and weakly crystalline iron oxide) were prepared and used the addition of 0.1%, 0.5% and 1.0% to decrease the Cd accumulation in wheat plants cultivated in weakly alkaline soil through pot experiments. The results showed that iron and manganese oxides could reduce the content of available Cd by transforming acid extractable Cd to reducible Cd and improve the antagonistic effect of wheat rhizosphere Cd with Fe and Mn in weakly alkaline soils, thereby significantly reducing Cd accumulation in wheat plants. The amendment performance followed the order of manganese oxide > iron-manganese composite oxides > iron oxide. The application of 1.0% manganese oxide decreased the available Cd in soils from 0.41 to 0.21 mg kg(-1), and correspondingly decreased Cd content in wheat roots, straw and grains by 56.2%, 49.9% and 70.0%, respectively. More importantly, the Cd content in grains was decreased to below the limit set by the China's food safety standard (0.10 mg kg(-1)). The present work reveals the effect of Cd accumulation by iron and manganese oxides in wheat, and develops an efficient approach for amending Cd polluted weakly alkaline soils.					lu, yang/IWE-3635-2023; liu, jiaming/IWE-3196-2023; wang, wei/JBS-7400-2023; wen, liang/JNR-7720-2023; liu, junyang/IXD-1252-2023; Liu, Yujie/IWU-6535-2023; Wang, lingyu/JLM-2013-2023; liu, junyang/IXD-1201-2023; yuan, liping/JPK-7584-2023; zhang, chen/JES-0371-2023; Qiu, Guohong/E-5495-2012; XIE, WANYING/JNR-9259-2023; QIU, LI/JPK-7397-2023; Zhang, Xiaoyue/JFS-9880-2023; wang, yu/IUQ-6654-2023; wang, yingying/JSK-6741-2023; Wang, lili/IXD-9828-2023; Liu, Lihu/AFH-8586-2022; LI, XIAO/JCE-6169-2023	Liu, Yujie/0000-0002-1153-6156; Qiu, Guohong/0000-0002-1181-3707; Liu, Lihu/0000-0001-7026-769X; 													0959-6526	1879-1786				SEP 10	2022	365								132794	10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132794	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132794													WOS:000821998000001

The present study in the Sekota district, northeastern Amhara region, Ethiopia evaluated the influence of areas exclosures on woody species diversity, population structure and regeneration status. A total of 36 and 27 quadrats, each 20 m x 20 m, were used to collect data in exclosures and non-exclosures, respectively. Within quadrats, four 5 m x 5 m and 2 m x 2 m quadrats at the corners were used to sample saplings and seedlings, respectively. In exclosures, 35 woody species representing 21 families and 29 genera were recorded; 19 woody species representing 13 families and 13 genera were recorded in the non-exclosure. Acacia etbaica was the most dominant species in the two land-uses. The Shannon diversity index was 1.77 +/- 0.46 in exclosures and 1.39 +/- 0.46 in non-exclosures. Shannon and Simpson diversity indices showed a significant difference between the two land-uses (p < 0.01). The regeneration status of all wood species in exclosures was good, only fair in non-exclosures. Area exclosures have thus played a great role in the restoration of degraded lands by improving vegetation diversity and regeneration status. The least dominant woody species should be maintained through active restoration. Continuous follow-up, maintenance of soil water conservation structure to improve soil fertility will further help enhance the woody species diversity and abundance.

Most previous studies in this region aim to understand the impacts of long-term irrigation on the land. In this paper, we analyze the Mezquital Valley as a socioecological system (SES) within the framework of the dryland development paradigm (DDP). The integrative principles of unpacking, traverse and sharing were used to untangle the biophysical and socio-economic subsystems and their interactions. Small landholders were identified as the main drivers of change. The high availability of wastewater has put farmers in a precarious comfort zone where high crop yields are obtained by overlooking environmental tradeoffs; treatment of wastewater is therefore perceived as a threat to the status quo, due to assumed increased cost or reduced access. Academia can build a functional learning community with farmers to understand the benefits of wastewater treatment. This community can develop sustainable water management strategies based on technical innovations and market diversification, empowering farmers to face upcoming external threats like climate change.

To date, research has mostly specialized in changes in the soil microorganisms between disturbed and undisturbed biocrusts, and it is unclear whether disturbance intensity drives the soil microorganisms in biocrusts toward distinct responses. Thus, we investigated the changes in biocrust characteristics, soil properties and microbial abundance at six simulated grazing disturbance gradients (based on the coverage of the broken biocrusts) in the Loess Plateau region of China. The results showed that moderate disturbance, in which the biocrust coverage experienced a 20-30% breakage, was beneficial for improving the abundances of bacteria, actinomycetes and total microorganisms, but severe disturbance (i.e., 40-50% disturbance) may result in a significant reduction in abundance. The increased fungal abundance with the disturbance gradients was related to the aerobic feature of fungi. Additionally, a varied proportion of actinomycetes and bacterial abundance was found under disturbance. Disturbance induced the alteration of soil aeration, moisture and nutrient status (total N or ratio of C/N) that driving the changes of microbial abundance. These results will be meaningful for evaluating the ecosystem services of biocrusts under a disturbance event in dryland ecosystems.

Conservation tillage has been widely applied to promote aggregate stability, enhance soil organic C (SOC) storage, and conjointly influence microbial community composition. However, the relation among soil microbial groups, aggregate stability and SOC stocks under management practices remains unclear. We conducted a 17year field experiment in a spring maize cropping system on the Loess Plateau of northwest China, comparing three types of management: conventional tillage with residue removal (CT-RR), reduced tillage with residue incorporation (RT-RI) and no-tillage with residue mulching (NT-RM). We evaluated aggregate stability index (ASI), SOC stocks and microbial community composition at 0-10 and 10-25 cm. The results showed that RT-RI and NT-RM significantly increased ASI by 11% and 16% relative to CT-RR in the 0-10 cm layer; RT-RI significantly increased ASI by 13% relative to CT-RR in the 10-25 cm layer (p < 0.05). The RT-RI increased the SOC concentrations and SOC stocks of macroaggregates (>250 mu m), which harbor most of the total SOC stocks in bulk soil. Both RT-RI and NT-RM increased total microbial biomass and biomass of six microbial groups (i.e., gramnegative bacteria (GN), gram-positive bacteria (GP), total bacteria (B), total fungi (F), arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and saprophytic fungi (SF)) at 0-10 cm, and RT-RI increased the above groups at 10-25 cm. Across a range of microbial community indicators, we found strong positive relationships between SOC and GN, ASI and AMF in bulk soil. A random forest analysis indicated that GN and F were the best microbial predictors of SOC concentrations and overall aggregate stability, whereas AMF/SF was the best predictor of SOC concentrations within aggregates and the stability of individual aggregate size classes. These results demonstrated a strong link between aggregate stability, SOC dynamics and microbial community composition, and suggest that conservation tillage increases both soil aggregation and SOC storage, thus providing sustainability and technical feasibility for the development of dryland agroecosystems.					van Groenigen, Kees Jan/Q-7081-2018; Zhang, Yuan/JUF-7293-2023; Liu, Xiaotong/AAT-4220-2021; LI, YUN/JTV-7108-2023; Li, Yan/JUU-5189-2023	van Groenigen, Kees Jan/0000-0002-9165-3925; Liu, Xiaotong/0000-0001-9393-933X; Wu, Xueping/0000-0002-7772-0773													0341-8162	1872-6887				DEC	2023	233								107509	10.1016/j.catena.2023.107509	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.107509		SEP 2023											WOS:001082968500001

Yet, woody vegetation is often able to recover from mortality events once precipitation returns to pre-drought conditions. Climate change, however, may impact woody vegetation resilience due to more extreme and frequent droughts. Thus, better understanding how woody vegetation responds to drought events is essential. We used a phenology-based remote sensing approach coupled with field data to estimate the severity and recovery rates of a large scale die-off event that occurred in 2014-2015 in Senegal. Novel low (L-band) and high-frequency (Ku-band) passive microwave vegetation optical depth (VOD), and optical MODIS data, were used to estimate woody vegetation dynamics. The relative importance of soil, human-pressure, and before-drought vegetation dynamics influencing the woody vegetation response to the drought were assessed. The die-off in 2014-2015 represented the highest dry season VOD drop for the studied period (1989-2017), even though the 2014 drought was not as severe as the droughts in the 1980s and 1990s. The spatially explicit Die-off Severity Index derived in this study, at 500 m resolution, highlights woody plants mortality in the study area. Soil physical characteristics highly affected die-off severity and post-disturbance recovery, but pre-drought biomass accumulation (i.e., in areas that benefited from above-normal rainfall conditions before the 2014 drought) was the most important variable in explaining die-off severity. This study provides new evidence supporting a better understanding of the "greening Sahel", suggesting that a sudden increase in woody vegetation biomass does not necessarily imply a stable ecosystem recovery from the droughts in the 1980s. Instead, prolonged above-normal rainfall conditions prior to a drought may result in the accumulation of woody biomass, creating the basis for potentially large-scale woody vegetation die-off events due to even moderate dry spells.

Accounting for non-rainfall moisture and temperature improves litter decay model performance in a fog-dominated dryland system	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Historically, ecosystem models have treated rainfall as the primary moisture source driving litter decomposition. In many arid and semi-arid lands, however, non-rainfall moisture (fog, dew, and water vapor) plays a more important role in supporting microbial activity and carbon turnover. To date though, we lack a robust approach for modeling the role of non-rainfall moisture in litter decomposition. We developed a series of simple litter decay models with different moisture sensitivity and temperature sensitivity functions to explicitly represent the role of non-rainfall moisture in the litter decay process. To evaluate model performance, we conducted a 30-month litter decomposition study at 6 sites along a fog and dew gradient in the Namib desert, spanning almost an eightfold difference in non-rainfall moisture frequency. Litter decay rates in the field correlated with fog and dew frequencies but not with rainfall. Including either temperature or non-rainfall moisture sensitivity functions improved model performance, but the combination of temperature and moisture sensitivity together provided more realistic estimates of litter decomposition than relying on either alone. Model performance was similar regardless of whether we used continuous moisture sensitivity functions based on relative humidity or a simple binary function based on the presence of moisture, although a Gaussian temperature sensitivity outperformed a monotonically increasing Q(10) temperature function. We demonstrate that explicitly modeling non-rainfall moisture and temperature together is necessary to accurately capture litter decay dynamics in a fog-affected dryland system and provide suggestions for how to incorporate non-rainfall moisture into existing Earth system models.

Although these are worldwide phenomena, sufficient knowledge about anthropogenic effects caused by various populated areas in dryland ecosystems is lacking. This study explored anthropogenic development in rural areas and its effects on the conservation of protected areas in drylands, focusing on the change in VC, the reasons, extent, and the drivers of change. We propose a novel framework for exploring VC change (VCC) as a function of environmental and human-driven factors including different types of populated areas in drylands. As a case study, we used a 30-year time series of Landsat satellite images over the arid region of Israel to analyze spatiotemporal VCC. The temporal analysis involved the Contextual Mann-Kendall significance test and spatial analysis to model clustering of VCC. A Gradient Boosted Regression machine learning algorithm was applied to study the relative influence of environmental and human-driven factors on VCC. In addition, we used ANOVA to examine differences between the effects of three types of populated areas on the spatiotemporal trends of VC. The results show that the most influential environmental variable on VCC was elevation (relative contribution of 17%), followed by slope (14.8%) and distance from populated areas (14.6%). Moreover, different types of populated areas affected VC differently with varying distances from residential centroids. The nature reserves increased VC positively and significantly, while livestock settlements had a negative effect. Change in vegetation was mostly confined to the stream network and occurred in lower elevations. The study demonstrates how different land-use practices alter the landscape in terms of VC and differ in their extents, patterns, and effects. With the expected growth in population and residential development worldwide, the proposed framework may assist conservation managements and policy makers in minimizing environmental degradation in drylands.

Sensitivity of dryland plant allometry to climate	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												Patterns of plant biomass partitioning are fundamental to estimates of primary productivity and ecosystem process rates. Allometric relationships between above-ground plant biomass and non-destructive measures of plant size, such as cover, volume or stem density are widely used in plant ecology. Such size-biomass allometry is often assumed to be invariant for a given plant species, plant functional group or ecosystem type. Allometric adjustment may be an important component of the short- or long-term response of plants to abiotic conditions. We used 18 years of size-biomass data describing of 85 plant species to investigate the sensitivity of allometry to precipitation, temperature or drought across two seasons and four ecosystems in central New Mexico, USA. Size-biomass allometry varied with climate in 65%-70% of plant species. Closely related plant species had similar sensitivities of allometry to natural spatiotemporal variation in precipitation, temperature or drought. Annuals were less sensitive than perennials, and forbs were less sensitive than grasses or shrubs. However, the differences associated with plant life history or functional group were not independent of plant evolutionary history, as supported by the application of phylogenetically independent contrasts. Our results demonstrate that many plant species adjust patterns in the partitioning of above-ground biomass under different climates and highlight the importance of long-term data for understanding functional differences among plant species.

To optimise the characterisation of sheet erosion on slope farmland in South China, the present study conducted field simulation rainfall experiments with vegetated and fallow soils. According to the results, sheet erosion rate first increased with an increase in rainfall duration and then stabilised. Exclusive P. vulgaris planting and P. vulgaris in combination with earthworms could reduce sheet erosion by 10-60%, and the combined method could better control sheet erosion. There were significant differences in erosion rate between mild and steep slopes, and light and heavy rain conditions. The influence of rain intensity on sheet erosion was greater than that of slope. Soil organic matter (SOM), rain intensity, and slope can be used to optimise sheet erosion equations of exposed slopes, and SOM and hydraulic parameters can be used to optimise sheet erosion equations in vegetated slopes. The results of the present study could facilitate the reduction of the time and space variability errors in the establishment of sheet erosion models for vegetated slopes.																			2045-2322					APR 15	2022	12	1							6276	10.1038/s41598-022-09258-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-09258-x								35428771					WOS:000782844000042

Differing climate and landscape effects on regional dryland vegetation responses during wet periods allude to future patterns	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Dryland vegetation is influenced by biotic and abiotic land surface template (LST) conditions and precipitation (PPT), such that enhanced vegetation responses to periods of high PPT may be shaped by multiple factors. High PPT stochasticity in the Chihuahuan Desert suggests that enhanced responses across broad geographic areas are improbable. Yet, multiyear wet periods may homogenize PPT patterns, interact with favorable LST conditions, and in this way produce enhanced responses. In contrast, periods containing multiple extreme high PPT pulse events could overwhelm LST influences, suggesting a divergence in how climate change could influence vegetation by altering PPT periods. Using a suite of stacked remote sensing and LST datasets from the 1980s to the present, we evaluated PPT-LST-Vegetation relationships across this region and tested the hypothesis that enhanced vegetation responses would be initiated by high PPT, but that LST favorability would underlie response magnitude, producing geographic differences between wet periods. We focused on two multiyear wet periods; one of above average, regionally distributed PPT (1990-1993) and a second with locally distributed PPT that contained two extreme wet pulses (2006-2008). 1990-1993 had regional vegetation responses that were correlated with soil properties. 2006-2008 had higher vegetation responses over a smaller area that were correlated primarily with PPT and secondarily to soil properties. Within the overlapping PPT area of both periods, enhanced vegetation responses occurred in similar locations. Thus, LST favorability underlied the geographic pattern of vegetation responses, whereas PPT initiated the response and controlled response area and maximum response magnitude. Multiyear periods provide foresight on the differing impacts that directional changes in mean climate and changes in extreme PPT pulses could have in drylands. Our study shows that future vegetation responses during wet periods will be tied to LST favorability, yet will be shaped by the pattern and magnitude of multiyear PPT events.

Influence of Irrigation Modalities (Irrigation Management and Dryland), Fruit Ripening, and Cultivation Modality (Organic and Conventional) on Quality and Chemosensory Profile of Hojiblanca and Picual Extra Virgin Olive Oils	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF LIPID SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												A study with controlled field and authentic samples of olives, obtained in similar conditions of soil, climate, region, harvest, and with the same cultivation techniques and considering simultaneously different agronomic factors (olive variety, fruit ripening degree, irrigation, and organic or conventional production system) is performed to evaluate their influence on quality and added value of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). Agronomical and physicochemical parameters, polyphenols, tocopherols, and fatty acid composition and volatile and sensory profiles are determined in Hojiblanca and Picual VOOs obtained from different fruit ripening degrees and different cultivation modalities (conventional with and without irrigation, and organic with irrigation). Among volatile compounds, 1-hydroxy-2-propanone, (E)-linalool oxide, and 2-acetylfuran are described for the first time in EVOO. The variable that most influences the chemosensory composition of EVOOs is the variety, followed by the stage of ripeness, and, within each variety, the cultivation modality. Organic irrigation differ from conventional modalities, showing significant differences in acidity, stability, tocopherol and polyphenol contents, fatty acid composition, and sensory attributes. Practical Applications: Results are of great importance, due to their applicability to the EVOO sector, allowing one to know the qualitative, chemical and organoleptic differences between organic and conventional EVOO, and factors that improve the quality and performance of EVOO.

Although the response of biological N fixation (BNF) to salt stress has received much research attention, less is known about how N fixing plants may adjust their N acquisition strategies in response to variation in salt stress. Alhagi sparsifolia, a perennial deep-rooted legume located in both riparian and desert environments of the hyperarid Taklimakan Desert, China, is a regionally important species due to its capacity for fixing atmospheric N and increasing soil stability. We investigated how groundwater biogeochemistry was related to seasonal differences in BNF of Alhagi sparsifolia located at terminal ends of a soil salinity gradient (high salinity riparian; inland low salinity sand dunes) in the Taklimakan Desert. Additionally, to elucidate the plasticity of A. sparsifolia nitrogen fixation to variation in soil salinity, we experimentally treated Alhagi seedlings from the same parental lineage with NaCl, Na2SO4, NH4NO3, and groundwater, and evaluated N fixation potential via root nodule development. We did not find evidence that mineral nitrogen concentrations influenced the varied N-2 fixation rates (indicated by foliar d15N value) in A. sparsifolia that we observed in the field. Instead, BNF of Alhagi plants was higher in high salinity riparian areas, whereas these plants utilized groundwater N when located in low salinity inland sand dunes. In our experimental treatments, salt addition did not significantly influence the nodulation of Alhagi seedlings, suggesting that nitrate assimilation instead of BNF is suppressed by salt stress. Thus, BNF in A. sparsifolia is tolerant to salt stress, and can be adjusted in response to variation in N availability and soil salinity. Relationships between salt tolerance and biological nitrogen fixation in A. sparsifolia explains how these species can increase soil nutrient availability across differing dryland environments, and illustrates a possible strategy whereby dryland legumes enhance their adaptability to saline environments by both building symbiotic associations with Rhizobium and utilizing readily available N when salt stress is less prohibitive.

Sixteen genotypes of spring wheat introduced and grown over the past 120 years were compared in terms of their yield and yield-related traits. As the grain yield increased, the spike number per unit area and the grain number per spike increased linearly, but the 1000-kernel weight was not correlated with grain yield. In the more recent genotypes, anthesis was initiated significantly earlier, although the length of the period from anthesis to maturity remained unchanged. Water use and the Effective Use of Water (EUW) for aboveground biomass before anthesis and the contribution of pre-anthesis aboveground biomass to grain yield all decreased as grain yield increased. Soil water content at anthesis was negatively correlated with aboveground biomass at anthesis, but positively correlated with grain yield. Conclusively, breeding in spring wheat over the past century has increased the yield of new genotypes by (1) increasing the number of grains per unit area; (2) shortening the period of vegetative growth; (3) decreasing EUW and the soil water use before anthesis; thereby (4) retaining more soil water and increasing biomass accumulation after anthesis. Future spring wheat breeding for this dryland region should determine whether the time for grain filling from anthesis to maturity can be extended to enable greater use of environmental resources and higher yields.

Some are in demand in agricultural production systems due to their high potential market value, because of their roles as grain or forage crops, their nitrogen fixation capability, and because they provide a disease break or improve soil health. While several pulse crops have been identified for winter-season cropping, there are few adapted legumes apart from mungbean that are appropriate for dryland summer cropping. Currently, short-duration crops of mungbean are commonly used, but yields are highly variable and susceptible to drought. Here, we propose that cowpea has the potential to become an alternative rotation crop in dryland summer cropping zones, providing a competitive and profitable alternative pulse crop option where its drought tolerance could enable better performance under inconsistent in-crop rainfall. We demonstrate that cowpea has nutritional properties and putative uses that could prove valuable in emerging plant-based protein and aquaculture markets.

A stakeholder-driven, science-based multimodel approach has been developed and used by the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) to generate actionable information for adaptation planning processes. For a range of mid-century climate projections-likely to be hotter, drier, and more variable-contrasting future socio-economic scenarios (Representative Agricultural Pathways, RAPs) were co-developed with stakeholders to portray a sustainable development scenario and a rapid economic growth pathway. The unique characteristic of this application is the integration of a multi- modeling approach with stakeholder engagement to co-develop scenarios and adaptation strategies. Distribution of outcomes were simulated with climate, crop, livestock, and economic impact assessment models for smallholder crop livestock farmers in a typical dryland agro-ecological zone in Zimbabwe, characterized by low and erratic rainfall and nutrient depleted soils. Results showed that in Nkayi District, Western Zimbabwe, climate change would threaten most of the farms, and, in particular, those with large cattle herds due to feed shortages. Adaptation strategies that showed the most promise included diversification using legume production, soil fertility improvement, and investment in conducive market environments. The switch to more legumes in the farming systems reduced the vulnerability of the very poor as well as the more resourced farmers. Overall, the sustainable development scenario consistently addressed institutional failures and motivated productivity-enhancing, environmentally sound technologies and inclusive development approaches. This yielded more favorable outcomes than investment in quick economic wins from commercializing agriculture.					crespo, olivier/L-6398-2013; Ruane, Alex/ABD-5612-2021; Valdivia, Roberto/R-1755-2017	crespo, olivier/0000-0001-7320-9428; Valdivia, Roberto/0000-0002-0002-848X; Homann-Kee Tui, Sabine/0000-0001-8570-336X; Sisito, Givious/0000-0001-6868-6916; MOYO, Elisha N/0000-0002-3833-8272													0165-0009	1573-1480				SEP	2021	168	1-2							10	10.1007/s10584-021-03151-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-021-03151-8													WOS:000698946800002

Knowledge of the factors that drive soil respiration in drylands is limited, despite these regions represent more than 40% of the Earth land's surface. In these environments, biocrusts play an important role in CO2 exchange towards and from soils. However, the temporal dynamics and main drivers of CO2 efflux in biocrusts compared to other representative dryland covers such as bare soil and soil under perennial grasses, has not been fully investigated. In this study, we measured the soil CO2 molar fraction (chi(c)) at 2 and 5 cm depths in representative surface covers (cyanobacteria and lichen dominated biocrusts, soil under the alpha grass Macrochloa tenacissima and bare soil) from a semiarid area in SE Spain (Tabernas desert, Almeria) using small solid-state CO2 sensors, during one hydrological year. We determined the CO2 efflux (F-s) from the 0 to 5 cm soil profile using the gradient method. Our results show that soil chi(c) and F-s were low in all surface covers (on average, 464 ppm at 5 cm) during dry soil periods (soil moisture <0.05 m(3) m(-3)). chi(c) and subsequent F-s rapidly increased after rainfall, and showed the highest values in the soil under grass (M. tenacissima) and lichen biocrusts. Time series analysis of F-s allowed identifying periodic patterns in F-s strongly related to moisture and temperature periodicities. Moisture was the main driver for F-s on timescales of weeks and months, while temperature was the main driver on daily scales. Moisture exerted a greater influence on F-s in lichen and soil under grass, while temperature had a greater effect on F-s in cyanobacteria and bare soil. Estimated annual CO2 efflux was 633 g CO2 m(-2) y(-1) in the soil under M. tenacissima, 450 g CO2 m(-2) y(-1) in the lichen biocrust, 268 g CO2 m(-2) y(-1) in the cyanobacterial biocrust and 188 g CO2 m(-2) y(-1) in the bare soil. On the whole, we demonstrate the suitability of automated F-s measurements for characterising rapid changes in C efflux from dryland surfaces due to changing environmental conditions, which can help improve C predictions in drylands under current climate change.

Due to the harmful nature of the chemical pesticides used against such pathogens, extensive research has focused on developing sustainable solutions such as biocontrol agents. Nevertheless, the complex interaction of such agents with their biotic and abiotic environment is challenging. Filamentous cyanobacteria, the pioneers and main primary producers in biological soil crusts (BSC), show considerable tolerance to extreme environmental conditions within the crust. Soil inoculation with cyanobacteria is a promising practice for sustainable agriculture in drylands where high tolerant organisms is required. Nevertheless, its plant protection potential has been less explored. Cyanobacteria such as Leptolyngbya ohadii, a dominant species in the BSC of the northwest Negev desert, Israel, are known to produce a large array of secondary metabolites. Application of L.ohadii spent media severely inhibits the growth of various prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Its resilience and the observed antimicrobial activity thus make L.ohadii a promising candidate for the development of a biocontrol agent. However, little is known about the effect of environmental conditions on its antimicrobial activity. Here we examined the antifungal activity of L.ohadii on a range of soil-borne fungal pathogens. We assessed the effect of the daily hydration/dehydration cycle of its natural habitat on the expression of gene clusters for secondary metabolites production using a novel custom-made environmental conditions simulation chamber. Our data advance the understanding of the complex interaction of L.ohadii with its biotic and abiotic environment for application as a dryland biocontrol agent.																			0334-2123	1876-7184				SEP	2023	51	4					717	725		10.1007/s12600-022-01031-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12600-022-01031-0		OCT 2022											WOS:000871286000001

The colonization of drylands by early vascular plants: Evidence from Early Devonian fossil soils and <i>in situ</i> plant traces from South China	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												The mid-Paleozoic colonization of land by plants induced profound changes in the Earth's surface environments. However, it remains poorly understood how the earliest vascular plants, arising during the Silurian and Devonian periods, adapted to and functioned in ancient drylands. Today, drylands occupy similar to 45% of the Earth's land surface and support diverse ecosystems forming the Earth's most extensive biome. By contrast, only sparse records of dryland systems have been documented from Silurian-and Devonian-aged deposits, and furthermore, in most cases, the evidence for recognizing major plant types is compromised by poor preservation potential of organic matter in such dry environments. Here, we recognize an Early Devonian dryland river system represented by the Guijiatun Formation, Qujing, Yunnan, South China, based on an integrative study combining paleopedology, geochemistry, and paleobotany. This formation contains diverse and abundant redbed calcareous paleosols, most being classified as Calcisols. Such paleosols are interpreted as developing within well-drained landscapes that experienced a semiarid climate with seasonal wet-dry cycles, and are geochemically characterized by the sub-surface accumulation and reorganization of pedogenic carbonates. Extensive plant traces are preserved in most of the paleosols observed in the Guijiatun Formation and show K-or H-shaped branching structures that are morphometrically comparable to the belowground rhizomes of zosterophyllopsids and early lycopsids. These plant-bearing paleosols provide direct evidence for the development of primitive vegetation on drylands. The soil inorganic carbon (SIC) contents stored as Ca-Mg carbonates in the Guijiatun paleosols are estimated at 38 +/- 8 g C kg(-1), comparable to the highest levels of present-day dryland ecosystems. We argue that dryland floras could have been a significant component of the Early Devonian landscapes, controlling the retention of both mobile elements (Ca and Mg) and fine-grained sediment on land, and mantling and protecting buried soil carbon against erosion.

J	Marshall, JC; Lobegeiger, JS; Starkey, A				Marshall, Jonathan C.; Lobegeiger, Jaye S.; Starkey, Alisa			Risks to Fish Populations in Dryland Rivers From the Combined Threats of Drought and Instream Barriers	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												In dryland rivers, flow intermittency means fish populations are often subjected to drought disturbance. The viability of these fish populations depends on the availability of waterhole refuges for individuals to survive drought (resistance) and the ability of surviving fish to repopulate the rivers by recruitment and dispersal once flow returns (resilience). In this study we combined remote-sensed mapping of the locations of waterholes that lasted through an extreme drought in the northern Murray Darling Basin, Australia, with an assessment of the impacts of in-stream barriers on limiting the opportunities for fish to move and repopulate after drought. We found that at the peak of this 2018-2020 drought, the worst on record for some rivers and the most spatially synchronous recorded across the region, waterholes were few and generally small - representing only 11% of the total river channel network. All the fish in the region that survived the drought were concentrated into this limited waterhole refuge habitat. Even small instream structures, such as minor weirs, caused large reductions in the opportunities for fish to move between river segments when there is flow. Almost all the 104 instream structures assessed reduced long-term fish movement opportunities, measured as days with discharge greater than calculated barrier drown out thresholds, by more than 70% and up to 100%, when compared to opportunities for movement if the barrier was not present. This large impact from small instream barriers is a consequence of flow intermittency and is likely to reduce fish population resilience and impact the capacity of fish populations to recover after drought. Combining information on the risks posed by limited refuge habitat availability during drought and from reduced movement opportunity following drought allowed us to identify river segments where these combined threats are the greatest risk to viability of local fish populations. Considering the spatial arrangements of these risks provides a means to systematically prioritize mitigation measures such as weir removal to improve fish movement opportunities and local management of key waterholes to increase drought resistance. The approach used here provides a guide for assessing and prioritizing the management of fish population viability risks from drought and fragmentation by barriers in any non-perennial river setting.

The non-material links between people and dryland ecosystems are largely ignored and its integration into dryland restoration and management remains a challenge. The studies reviewed in this paper highlight the development of cultural ecosystem services (CES) evaluation in drylands. We found that CES may act as a reference or indicator for diverse motivations and mitigate the potential conflicts between individuals and groups and has great potential for fostering sustainable dryland development with local engagement. The way that local people would be influenced by or the role that they could play in influencing dryland restorations should be interconnected, to improve the shared ecological and sociocultural benefits.

J	Sun, MY; Chen, W; Lapen, DR; Ma, B; Lu, PA; Liu, JH				Sun, Mengyuan; Chen, Wen; Lapen, David R.; Ma, Bin; Lu, Peina; Liu, Jinghui			Effects of ridge-furrow with plastic film mulching combining with various urea types on water productivity and yield of potato in a dryland farming system	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Ridge-furrow with plastic film mulching (RM) has the potential to enhance crop yields and water productivity, particularly in semi-arid regions. However, the combined effects of RM and various urea types on rainfed potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) production remain unclear. A three-year field experiment (2018-2020) was conducted to elucidate the effects of the RM combined with various urea types on water productivity, tuber yield, and eco-nomic benefits in a dryland farming system. Treatments consisted of two mulching patterns [RM and no plastic film mulching (NM)], combined with the application of three urea types [common urea (U), controlled-release urea (C), and mixed C and U at a ratio of 1:1 (CU)]. Our results indicated that compared to NM, the RM system reduced soil evaporative losses, which ultimately increased average soil water storage for the 0-60 cm soil layer by 6.7% (P < 0.05). In addition, RM increased the mean soil temperature for the 0-10 cm soil layer by 1.4 degrees C compared with NM. These changes in soil under RM helped increase plant height, leaf chlorophyll, and nitrogen balance index, but reduced leaf flavonoid, thereby improving tuber yield. The application of CU further improved plant height, leaf chlorophyll, and nitrogen balance index, which allowed the exploitation of more soil water to increase tuber yield and water productivity (P < 0.05). The interactions of mulching and urea type had significant influence on the tuber yield, water productivity, and partial factor productivity of nitrogen, especially with the RMCU. RMCU significantly (P < 0.05) increased potato yield (up to 23.5%), water productivity (23.7%), partial factor productivity of nitrogen (23.5%), and economic benefit (38.4%), compared to the NMU during both drought and non-drought growing seasons. We conclude that compared with other treatments, RMCU resulted in the highest tuber yield, water productivity, and economic benefit across three growing seasons and should be considered an effective strategy to foster sustainable potato production in dryland farming systems.

However, the majority of studies focused on a two-dimensional scale, especially lacking of field measured data. We employed the interpolation method with gradient plane nodal function (GPNF) and Shepard (SPD) across a range of parameters to simulate SOCD with a 40 cm soil layer depth in a dryland farming region (DFR) of China. The SOCP was estimated using a carbon saturation model. Results demonstrated the GPNF method was proved to be more effective in simulating the spatial distribution of SOCD at the vertical magnification multiple and search point values of 3.0x10(6) and 25, respectively. The soil organic carbon storage (SOCS) of 40 cm and 20 cm soil layers were estimated as 22.28x10(11) kg and 13.12x10(11) kg simulated by GPNF method in DFR. The SOCP was estimated as 0.95x10(11) kg considered as a carbon sink at the 20-40 cm soil layer. Furthermore, the SOCP was estimated as -2.49x10(11) kg considered as a carbon source at the 0-20 cm soil layer. This research has important values for the scientific use of soil resources and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.																			1009-637X	1861-9568				OCT	2021	31	10					1453	1468		10.1007/s11442-021-1906-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11442-021-1906-0													WOS:000702396300004
J	Metternicht, G; Smith, MS				Metternicht, Graciela; Smith, Mark Stafford			Commentary: on the under-valuing of Australia's expertise in drylands research and practice globally	RANGELAND JOURNAL												Global drylands are a significant driver of earth system processes that affect the world's common resources such as the climate. Their peoples are also among the first to be widely affected by global changes such as land degradation and climate change. Yet drylands are a source of many social and technical innovations, globally, as well as in Australia. As a major developed dryland nation, Australia has previously played a major role in extending these innovations to the rest of the world. The nation has reaped reputational and commercial benefits through major research and practice contributions to dryland agriculture, water management and governance, remote area services, indigenous partnerships, dryland monitoring systems, and 'desert knowledge' innovation. Australian researchers continue to contribute to various relevant international processes, yet recognition and support for this within Australia has dropped off markedly in recent years. We analyse the Australian government's investment in research and in overseas aid for drylands over the last two decades, and explore trends in government's active involvement in major international processes related to land. These trends are short-sighted, overlooking potential economic benefits for Australian enterprises, and undermining Australia's stance and scientific leadership in dryland systems globally. In this commentary, we argue that it is time for the trends to be reversed, as this is an area of comparative advantage for Australian diplomacy with significant returns on investment for Australia, both direct and indirect, especially when most emerging economies contain substantial drylands. We identify four major pathways to obtaining benefits from science diplomacy, and four interrelated actions within Australia to enable these - to place a higher emphasis on science diplomacy, to re-forge a bipartisan recognition of Australian drylands expertise, to establish a dedicated Dryland Information Hub, and to create a network of relevant science and technology advisors.

Detecting Streamflow in Dryland Rivers Using CubeSats	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Determining the flow regime of non-perennial rivers is critical in hydrology. In this study, we developed a new approach using CubeSat imagery to detect streamflow presence using differences in surface reflectance for areas within and outside of a river reach. We calibrated the approach with streamflow records in the Hassayampa River of Arizona over 3 years (2019-2021), finding good agreement in the annual fractions of flowing days at stream gages (R-2 = 0.82, p < 0.0001). Subsequently, annual fractions of flowing days were derived at 90 m intervals along the Hassayampa River, finding that 12% of reaches were classified as intermittent, with the remaining as ephemeral. Using a Hovmoller diagram, streamflow presence was visualized in unprecedented spatiotemporal detail, allowing estimates of daily fraction of flowing channel and annual fractions of flowing days. This new tool opens avenues for detecting streamflow and studying hydrological and biogeochemical processes dependent on water presence in drylands.

Examining the effects of different intensities of disturbance on biocrusts and exploring appropriate disturbance levels can provide important information about ecosystem processes and services in drylands. Methods Five disturbance intensities ranging from 10% to 50% based on the percentage of broken biocrusts were implemented to examine the effects of simulated goat trampling on microbial communities; microbial community structure was measured with the phospholipid fatty acid method. Results The effects of disturbance on the biocrusts were closely related to disturbance intensity. Surprisingly, moderate disturbance had a weak effect on total biocrust coverage but increased cyanobacterial coverage by 2 3%. Consequently, there was an increase in total N, a reduction in the C/N ratio and improvements in soil moisture, and these effects led to 13 21% and 5 6% increases in microbial biomass and diversity, respectively, compared with those in undisturbed biocrusts. However, high-intensity disturbance substantially reduced biocrust coverage and microbial abundance. Conclusions The study supports the intermediate disturbance hypothesis and suggests that moderate disturbance has positive effects on the microbial communities of biocrusts. These findings provide vital information for the ecological management of drylands.

We described and analysed the key elements and driving forces of change in a dryland terrace system in China through the narratives of 31 local farmers. We identified 16 key system elements related to farming tools, agricultural inputs, crops and diets and constructions. We distinguished the newly adopted and inherited elements and revealed relationships of complementarity or substitution among them. Land abandonment, the introduction of external inputs and dual-track farming, the mechanization of farming and the simplification of the farming calendar were identified as the main systemic changes. We discuss the importance of dynamic adaption process by integrating new elements with active traditional knowledge. We stress that local networks and the necessity of collective action in-and-outside the local community are crucial to preserve terraced systems. We suggest that understanding local perceptions of change and specific customs should be taken into consideration in policy making processes. We highlight the role of the Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems initiative (GIAHS), especially in the aspect of empowering farmers to activate the interaction and integration of inherited and newly adopted elements.

Overcoming agricultural sustainability challenges in water-limited environments through soil health and water conservation: insights from the Ogallala Aquifer Region, USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY												A rapid decline in water availability for crop production has driven substantial changes in cropping systems in the arid and semi-arid regions, including transitions from irrigated to dryland cropping. Management decisions play a critical role in the sustainability of agricultural systems facing transitions. Specifically, adopting practices that increase crop water use efficiency, improve soil health, and conserve water in the soil profile could improve agricultural sustainability. This review discusses published literature on the challenges associated with crop production and highlights management strategies to sustain soil health, enhance agricultural production, and farm profitability in the Ogallala Aquifer region to elucidate pathways to agricultural sustainability in water-limited environments around the world. We searched for published papers discussing soil health and water conservation practices, including conservation tillage, crop residue management, crop diversification, cover cropping, and livestock integration in cropping systems. These studies demonstrate adopting conservation systems can increase soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, water infiltration, soil microbial activities, water use efficiency, and decrease N fertilizer inputs compared to conventional systems. Integrating more than one soil and water conservation practice can complement to enhance soil health and sustainability of dryland or limited-irrigation agriculture in the Ogallala Aquifer region and similar agroecosystems across the world.

Branchiopod crustaceans are endemic to temporary waters and rely on banks of drought-resistant eggs in the sediment for survival across dry seasons. These egg banks are like archives to biologists and allow them to estimate population status and resilience, without the need to sample active communities. Such an approach has, however, not yet been fully explored. Here, we investigate egg bank abundance and morpho-species richness to assess the vulnerability of branchiopod communities in dryland landscapes. For study systems, we use 98 temporary wetlands across the Northern Cape Province, South Africa, which contained eggs of Notostraca, Anostraca, Spinicaudata and Cladocera. We invoked the insurance hypothesis to investigate community resilience and studied egg bank abundance to reveal population status. Our results indicate that branchiopod communities become more vulnerable along an aridity gradient, from the semi-arid eastern regions to the arid western parts of the province. Apart from longitude, we also considered a suite of other environmental descriptors to explain variability in egg bank abundance and richness patterns and found that egg bank abundance decreased with alkalinity.

Insights into dryland biocrust microbiome: geography, soil depth and crust type affect biocrust microbial communities and networks in Mojave Desert, USA	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Biocrusts are the living skin of drylands, comprising diverse microbial communities that are essential to desert ecosystems. Despite there being extensive knowledge on biocrust ecosystem functions and lichen and moss biodiversity, little is known about factors structuring diversity among their microbial communities. We used amplicon-based metabarcode sequencing to survey microbial communities from biocrust surface and subsurface soils at four sites located within the Mojave Desert. Five biocrust types were examined: Light-algal/Cyanobacteria, Cyanolichen, Green-algal lichen, Smooth-moss and Rough-moss crust types. Microbial diversity in biocrusts was structured by several characteristics: (i) central versus southern Mojave sites displayed different community signatures, (ii) indicator taxa of plant-associated fungi (plant pathogens and wood saprotrophs) were identified at each site, (iii) surface and subsurface microbial communities were distinct and (iv) crust types had distinct indicator taxa. Network analysis ranked bacteria-bacteria interactions as the most connected of all within-domain and cross-domain interaction networks in biocrust surface samples. Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Ascomycota functioned as hubs among all phyla. The bacteria Pseudonocardia sp. (Pseudonocardiales, Actinobacteria) and fungus Alternaria sp.

These problems could potentially be addressed by combining mulching during the summer fallow period and reducing N fertilization rate to the recommended levels. Thus, we assessed this possibility in a three-year in-situ field experiment with four treatments: farmers' customary fertilization (CF) and reduced N fertilization (RNF) with no mulching during the summer fallow period (CF and RNF, respectively), and RNF with plastic film mulch (PM) and straw mulch (SM) in the summer fallow period (i.e., RNF + PM and RNF + SM, respectively). We evaluated the effects of various treatments on wheat grain yield, economic profit and environmental risk. The average grain yields of the CF, RNF, RNF + PM and RNF + SM treatments were 5932, 5364, 5950 and 6240 kg ha(-1), respectively. In addition, the average and yearly soil water storage at pre-seeding were significantly higher for the RNF + SM and RNF + PM treatments than the RNF treatment by 23% and 18%, respectively. Moreover, the average increases in soil water storage during the summer fallow period were significantly higher for the RNF + SM and RNF + PM treatments than the RN treatment, by 63% and 44%, respectively. Both the average and yearly soil accumulated temperatures during the summer fallow period were significantly higher for the CF, RNF and RNF + PM treatments than the RNF + SM treatment. The NO3-1-N leaching occurred under the CF treatment during the summer fallow period, but not under the RNF, RNF + PM and RNF + SM treatments. The RNF + SM treatment resulted in a significantly higher economic profit and significantly lower greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) than the CF, RNF and RNF + PM treatments. Thus, mulching with straw during the summer fallow period and reducing N fertilization appears to be an environment-friendly strategy for dryland wheat production in northern China.																			1161-0301	1873-7331				FEB	2022	133								126440	10.1016/j.eja.2021.126440	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2021.126440		DEC 2021											WOS:000740711500007

The results show that during the research period both an improvement and degradation of the regional eco-environment occurred simultaneously. In the earlier period, the ecological environment tended to be worse, while in the later period, the eco-environmental quality was dramatically enhanced. Pasture ecological land in the study area had the strongest positive impact on the eco-environmental quality, while the negative effect of agricultural production land was severe. The quality of the regional eco-environment was enhanced (degraded) due to the extension (contraction) of ecological land. The construction of an ecological environment is a complex engineering task. Although the eco-environment in most areas of the study area showed an improving trend, the overall eco-environment remains relatively fragile. In the course of supporting high-quality regional social and economic growth and pursuing high-level environmental preservation strategies, we should take corresponding measures to protect and repair the regional ecological environment.																				2073-445X				MAY 12	2023	12	5							1060	10.3390/land12051060	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land12051060													WOS:000996614400001

Projecting the effect of climate change on planting date and cultivar choice for South African dryland maize production	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												The anticipated climate change in South Africa is of great concern as Southern Africa appears to be warming at twice that of the global average, limiting maize production in the country and threatening food security in the region. The formulation of effective adaptation measures calls for understanding how projected changes in temperature, precipitation, and climate extremes might become misaligned with the critical maize developmental stages, which are likely to impact crop development. We conducted an analysis of the climate change impacts for dryland maize phenology in Bloemfontein and Lichtenburg, which represent major maize growing regions of South Africa. The climate projections generated by six Global Climate Models under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 were used. Analyses were performed for four representative planting dates: November 15 (early), December 15 (optimal), January 15 (late), and February 5 (very late). Days to maturity decreased (by approx. 5-10 days) as years progressed from baseline period (1991-2020) to the far future period (2051-2080), at both locations with higher rates projected under RCP 8.5. The results suggest a longer summer season with receding freeze dates in these regions and might provide additional flexibility for adaptive strategies. At the optimal planting dates, future climate will likely affect both vegetative and reproductive stages of maize leading to the decrease in the days to maturity. A major factor affecting maize productivity is extreme temperature, with the number of days above 35 degrees C expected to increase 20-30% at the optimal planting date as climate changes progresses, which will likely limit grain filling and yield. Exploring maize phenology in the future at later planting dates revealed a decrease in days to maturity trending towards the optimal number of days required for each cultivar (100-110 days) in both regions. This coupled with the projected receding freeze date at these planting dates under future climates suggests there may be opportunities to shift planting to later dates in the region.																			0168-1923	1873-2240				OCT 15	2023	341								109695	10.1016/j.agrformet.2023.109695	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2023.109695		SEP 2023											WOS:001080114400001

The objective of this study was to examine the influence of tillage intensity and timing on micronutrient concentration of soils and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under dryland winter wheat-pea (Pisum sativum L.) or WW-P rotation. The treatments included moldboard tillage in fall (FT) and spring (ST), disk/chisel tillage (DT), and no-tillage (NT). The concentrations of Mehlich III extractable boron, manganese, zinc, copper, and iron in soil were unaffected by the tillage methods; however, a significant decline in extractable zinc in the top 10 cm soil was observed compared to an adjacent undisturbed grass pasture (GP) (NT: 2.3 mg kg(-1) vs. GP: 6.0 mg kg(-1)). In the upper 10 cm soil surface, NT (123 mg kg(-1)) maintained the extractable manganese concentration with GP (175 mg kg(-1)) whereas FT (97 mg kg(-1)), ST (92 mg kg(-1)), and DT (113 mg kg(-1)) had lower manganese than GP. Soil pH declined in the upper 10 cm under NT more than in the rest of the WW-P treatments. The results suggest NT can play a vital role in sustaining micronutrient availability due to decreased soil pH and the greater amount of organic matter within the surface soil of NT compared to other tillage methods.

However, information about how the use of selected sorghum grains affects nutritive values and its functional properties from sorghum flours is still lacking. To address this question, we selected six sorghum varieties (i.e., JinZa 34, LiaoZa 19, JinNuo 3, JiZa 127, JiNiang 2, and JiaXian) for the comprehensive analysis of the relationship among nutritional compositions, energy value contributions, and functional properties of sorghum grains. Results showed that Carr's index (CI) and angle of repose (AR) of all sorghum flours indicated good flow and compressibility properties in terms of micrometric parameters. All sorghums were considered free of tannin. Based on the scatterplot analysis, the proportions of energy contributions due to protein, fat, and carbohydrate (CHO), were highly positively correlated with protein, fat, and CHO, respectively. The significantly different flours of six sorghum varieties resulted in different functional properties. The amylose content showed a highly negative association with light transmittance and water and oil absorption capacities. In addition, amylose had a highly positive relationship with water solubility (WS) and swelling power (SP). JinNuo 3 had the highest nutritional compositions [proximate, mineral, anti-nutritional values, and amino acid (AA) profiles] and functional properties indicating that it could be used as a brewing liquor. Our findings will provide a new opportunity to cultivate sorghum as an environment friendly minor cereal crop in dryland agro-ecosystems of arid and semi-arid regions of northern China for nutritional security, agriculture processing, and non-food industry in the future.

Soil management legacy interacts with wheat genotype to determine access to organic N in a dryland system	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Organic nutrient management through the application of compost and/or cover crops provides mineralizable sources of nutrients for plants while often building soil organic matter (SOM) and various aspects of soil health. Variability in nutrient acquisition strategies between crop genotypes may confer advantages under different soil health contexts and could be important for crop selection and breeding, but crop response under field conditions remains unexplored. We investigated the ability of different genotypes of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to access nitrogen (N) from newly added cover crop residues in two soils with contrasting levels of SOM and biological activity. We planted three previously characterized wheat genotypes in a long-term dryland compost amendment field trial: 1) Byrd (modern, deep roots, low exudation), 2) Cheyenne (historic, drought susceptible, intermediate exudation), and 3) Snowmass (modern, drought-susceptible, high exudation). 15N-labelled cover crop residue was added to each plot and traced into wheat tissue. In the low SOM soil, the high exudate genotype Snowmass and historic genotype Cheyenne took up the most residue-derived N (6.4-8.1 kg N ha-1) compared to the low-exudate genotype Byrd (4.4 kg N ha-1), suggesting a strong exudate effect in the more carbon-limited soil. However, in the high SOM soil, the low-exudate, deep rooted genotype, Byrd, took up the most residue N (4.6 kg N ha-1 vs. 2.8 and 3.3 hg N ha-1 for Cheyenne and Snowmass, respectively), which indicated higher native N cycling activities and greater importance of drought resistance. Enzyme activity, inorganic N, and microbial communities were not influenced by genotype, though did show strong effects of compost application legacy. Our results show that belowground allocation strategies that favor microbial stimulation may be less successful under water limitation, especially when high native SOM and biological activity can support miner-alization of residue N without added investment in root inputs. Increased soil health through SOM-building management likely enhances nutrient cycling, and may better support root strategies that invest less in micro-bial stimulation in favor of other limiting resources.																			0167-8809	1873-2305				APR 1	2023	345								108336	10.1016/j.agee.2022.108336	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2022.108336		JAN 2023											WOS:000993202800001

Overall, there is little difference in the total area of drylands from the preindustrial period; global drylands are 8% wetter than during the preindustrial period as measured by an aridity index; and 16% of preindustrial drylands convert to a wetter climate subtype, double the sum of zones that are replaced by a drier category. Considerable variations are present among regions with major contractions of each dryland subtype from northern Africa to South Asia and the main expansions of arid, semiarid, and dry subhumid climates in southern hemisphere continents. The difference in precipitation is the leading factor of the aforementioned changes. The second factor is the altered potential evapotranspiration as mainly induced by relative humidity, which contributes to additional aridity changes in a same direction as precipitation does. The collective effects of precipitation and relative humidity account for more than 80% of the dryland variations. In comparison, the simulated aridity change is in reasonable agreement with reconstructions, while there are model-data discrepancies for Australia and uncertainties across proxies for southern Africa.

Ideal crops, tolerant to these events, such as cactus, can perform well under such changing climatic conditions. This study spatially maps land suitability for cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica) cultivation in India using the analytical hierarchical process (AHP). Nine essential growth factors that include the climate and edaphic components were considered for the period 2000 to 2007. About 32% of the total geographic area of the country is in the high to moderate suitable category. Remaining 46% falls under the marginally suitable and 22% under the low to very low suitable category. The suitability analysis, based on the precipitation anomaly (2008-2017), suggests a high probability of cactus growth in the western and east-central part of India. The relationship with aridity index shows a decreasing rate of suitability with the increase of aridity in the western and east-central provinces (beta-1 to -2). We conclude that integrating cactus into dryland farming systems and rangelands under changing climate can be one plausible solution to build resilient agro-ecosystems that provide food and fodder while enhancing the availability of ecosystem services.

However, detailed exploration of combined application on crop eco-physiological performance is limited. In this study, we explored the agronomic and eco-physiological responses of wheat crop grown under different combinations of rice-husk ash (RHA/biochar), farmyard manure (FYM) and chemical fertilizers in a silty loam soil. Aboveground biomass varied significantly across the treatments and was found higher (11-31%) under chemical fertilizer-applied treatments, but lower (6%) under sole RHA-applied treatment as compared to control. Crop eco-physiological parameters varied significantly (at P<0.01) with the treatment and crop growth stages. Sole chemical fertilizer- and FYM-applied treatments showed better (5-26% higher), whereas sole RHA- and combined RHA+FYM-applied treatments showed poor (2-15% lower) photosynthetic rate as compared to control. Ear length was moderately correlated (r=0.53) with aboveground biomass and explained 27% of the variability in it. Transpiration rate, intercellular CO2 concentration and water-use efficiency (WUEp) were identified as the major determinants of photosynthetic rate during vegetative and maturity growth stages. WUEp along with transpiration rate was found to explain 94% of the variability in photosynthetic rate for overall dataset. The findings suggest that combined RHA+FYM amendment may limit crop agronomic and eco-physiological performance due to nutrient immobilization. Therefore, combined application of RHA+FYM with chemical fertilizer application at reduced rate can be suggested for improving crop eco-physiological and agronomic responses under the sustainable agriculture practices in silty loam soils of tropical dryland agro-ecosystems.

However, these soils undergo swelling and shrinkage cycles, which exert a strong influence on soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics. The long-term effects of agricultural conservation practices on SOM content and stability on a Vertisol located in a tropical dryland area was evaluated. Two tillage systems (conventional tillage [CT], disc ploughing and extraction of 70% harvest residues, and no tillage [NT], incorporating 100% of the harvest residues) in combination with three different crop rotations (sorghum-soyabean [SrSy], maize-maize [MM] or soyabean-maize [SyM]) were tested. All plots were irrigated during dry periods. The effects on soil organic C, N, microbial biomass and aggregate size class distribution were evaluated. Carbon sink capacity were assessed by studying the aggregate-associated SOM content and quality (thermal recalcitrance), as determined by thermo-calorimetry. Relative to the CT system, NT yielded a higher percentage of small macroaggregates (2-0.25 mm). It also promoted the accumulation of aggregate-associated SOM, especially in the small macroaggregates and micro-aggregates. Thermal analysis revealed that the aggregate-associated SOM was more recalcitrant (higher values of T50 and more energy released at 475 degrees C) in NT than in CT. Coinciding with these effects, the soil microbial biomass/SOC ratio was lower in NT than in CT. The gain of SOM and the higher recalcitrance of OM in the NT soils may be related to different characteristics of NT Vertisols, such as poor aeration or disruption of the swelling and shrinkage cycles. The findings show that soil conservation practices increase the capacity for long-term C sequestration in Vertisols via organomineral interactions and SOM recalcitrance, which are determined by the formation of large cracks as a result of the swelling and shrinkage cycles that are some of the specific properties and processes of these soils.					hidalgo, claudia M/E-4797-2010; Merino, Agustin/I-5451-2015; limon-ortega, agustin/AAH-7015-2020; Aguirre, Eduardo/IXN-1380-2023	Merino, Agustin/0000-0003-3866-7006													0167-1987	1879-3444				NOV	2019	194								104348	10.1016/j.still.2019.104348	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2019.104348													WOS:000486360400047

OPTIMIZING THE SEEDING RATE IN SUBSOILING FOR DRYLAND WHEAT (<i>TRITICUM AESTIVUM</i> L.): A KEY TO IMPROVING WATER USE EFFICIENCY AND NITROGEN USE EFFICIENCY IN THE LOESS PLATEAU OF CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The effects of seeding rate and tillage on water use and nitrogen use efficiencies were studied based on a field experiment carried out from 2012 to 2016. The results showed that subsoiling significantly increased the soil water storage before sowing in all years. The water consumption (ET) during the four years was, on average, 461 and 301 mm for subsoiling (SS) and CK, respectively. The average yield of SS was 4821 kg/ha, which was 944 kg/ha higher than that of CK. The average yield was highest at the mid-seeding rate for both SS and CK, with values of 5115 and 4394 kg/ha, respectively. Since the nitrogen fertilizer application rate was the same, a higher yield indicates a higher nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). Contribution analysis showed that the higher seeding rate led to a lower contribution of nitrogen uptake efficiency (UPE) and a higher contribution of NHIp to NUEp. In summary, subsoiling during summer fallow period increased the soil water retention and improved the wheat yield and WUE. It also increased nitrogen uptake and NUEp. The mid-seeding rate (approximately 90 kg/ha) under subsoiling is optimal for improving water use efficiency (WUE) and NUE in the Loess Plateau.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2020	18	2					3015	3026		10.15666/aeer/1802_30153026	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1802_30153026													WOS:000530720800064

In this study, climate change impacts on irrigated corn and sorghum, dryland (rainfed) sorghum, and continuous fallow in the Northern High Plains of Texas were evaluated using an improved Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model equipped with management allowed depletion (MAD) irrigation scheduling. Projected climate data (2020-2099) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP 5) of 19 General Circulation Models (GCMs) were used. Climate data were divided into four 20-year periods of near future (2020-2039), middle (2040-2059), late (2060-2079), and end (2080-2099) of the 21st century under two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). For irrigated corn, median annual crop evapotranspiration (ET) and irrigation decreased by 8%-25% and 15%-42%, respectively, under the climate change scenarios compared to the historical period (2001-2010). The median yield was reduced by 3%-22% with exponentially decreases in the latter half of the 21st century. For sorghum, the reduction of median annual crop ET ranged from 6%-27%. However, the decline in the median annual irrigation was within 15%, except for the 2060-2079 and 2080-2099 periods under RCP 8.5 scenarios with 30% and 49% reductions in median annual irrigation. The median irrigated sorghum yield declined by 6%-42%. The median annual crop ET of dryland sorghum decreased by 10%-16%. The reduction in median yield was within 10% of the historical dryland sorghum yield. The decrease in median annual evaporation varied from 15%-23% under future continuous fallow conditions. The elevated CO2 level of future climate scenarios was the primary factor for the decrease in the ET and irrigation. The reduction in future crop yield was mainly attributed to the shortening of the maturity period caused by increased future temperature.

A.; Tooth, Stephen			Crevasse splay morphodynamics near a non-vegetated, ephemeral river terminus: Insights from process-based modelling	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Crevasse splays generate subtle local relief and contribute to fluvial basin sedimentary filling but controls on splay development along dryland rivers remain poorly understood owing to limited field, laboratory, and nu-merical modelling studies. Based on previously-acquired field data and new remote sensing observations of splay morphology and sedimentology (e.g. slope, width, length, grain size) and flooding characteristics (e.g. discharge, water depth and extent) near the terminus of the non-vegetated, ephemeral Rio Colorado on the southeastern margin of Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia, we undertake process-based modelling using Delft3D to isolate the role of hydrological controls on crevasse splay morphodynamics. Holding the potential sediment supply constant, we focus on the role of discharge (outflow from trunk channel to crevasse channel during rising stage), floodplain water levels, and backflow (reflux to the trunk channel during falling stage). Using nine different model runs, each with 10 simulated flood cycles, we show that the processes associated with these hydrological controls result in various outcomes, from short crevasse splay channels that may bifurcate and develop depositional bars to longer splays with one primary channel that mainly transfers sediment across the floodplain. Results reveal that increases in flood discharge lead to more rapid splay sedimentation and stabilization of a single crevasse channel. Increases in floodplain water level lead to shorter but wider splays and facilitate the formation of multiple stable crevasse channels. High floodplain water levels probably restrict splay length owing to decel-eration of outflow as floodplain water is encountered, but separate crevasse channels may form downstream as backflow breaches the trunk channel levee during falling stage. These findings support and extend previous observations from the Rio Colorado and other dryland rivers worldwide. Future modelling studies that consider a wider range of hydrological, sedimentological, and floodplain topographic conditions will help develop more comprehensive numerical models of splay development. A combination of insights from field, laboratory experimentation, remote sensing and modelling will improve knowledge of the cascades of channel-floodplain dynamics that characterise many dryland endorheic basins.

J	Fan, W; Wu, JG				Fan, Wei; Wu, Jinggui			Short-term effects of returning granulated straw on soil microbial community and organic carbon fractions in dryland farming	JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY												We conducted a 2-year field experiment which was comprised of five treatments, namely no straw returning (CK), straw mulching (SM), straw plowed into the soil (SP), and straw returned in granulated form (SG). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different straw returning modes on soil bacterial and fungal community structure and their relationships to soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions at three different soil depths (0-20, 20-40, and 40-60 cm) in a dryland under maize cultivation in Northeast (NE) China. SM, SP, and SG treatments significantly increased SOC content. Compared with SM and SP treatments, SG treatment significantly increased the content of SOC and easily oxidizable carbon (EOC) in the topsoil (0-20 cm depth), and increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and SOC content of the light fraction (LFOC) in the 20-40 cm layer. Meanwhile, SG treatment exhibited the highest microbial biomass C (MBC) content in all of the three soil depths. SG treatment also enhanced bacterial richness as well as fungal richness and diversity in the upper 40 cm of soil. In addition, SG treatment increased the relative abundance ofProteobacteriain all depths, and had the highest relative abundance ofBasidiomycotain the first 20 cm of soil. SP treatment showed the lowest soil organic carbon content in all fractions and soil microbial community composition. SM treatment exhibited similar results to SG treatment in SOC, DOC, and LFOC contents, and bacterial diversity in the topsoil and subsoil. As a whole, treatment SG improved soil quality and maize yield, hence we recommend returning granulated straw as the most effective practice for enhancing labile SOC fractions as well as maintaining soil diversity and microbial richness of arid farmlands in NE China.						fan, wei/0000-0003-0012-118X													1225-8873	1976-3794				AUG	2020	58	8					657	667		10.1007/s12275-020-9266-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12275-020-9266-5		JUN 2020						32583286					WOS:000543147800002

Pasture and lamb production from binary and diverse mixtures (Mix) of tall fescue (TF) with white clover (Whc), balansa clover (Bc), subterranean clover (Sc) and birdsfoot trefoil (Bft) were compared in a summer-dry hill site in Corvallis, Oregon over a two-year period. In 2018, all pasture combinations provided similar lamb liveweight gains (LWG, mean 177 g/day) in the first half of spring. Lambs in TF-Bc and TF-Mix pastures grew 31 to 41 g/day faster than those grazing TF-Sc, TF-Whc and TF-Bft in the second half of spring (p < .05). Overall, TF-Bc and TF-Mix had higher (p < .05) legume contents (32% and 37% respectively) compared to other pasture combinations. In spring 2019, lambs that grazed the TF-Mix and TF-Whc pastures had higher LWG than those on other pastures (p < .05). The superior lamb growth rates were associated with the higher legume content and pasture quality maintained into the late spring period. Overall, the legume content of all pastures decreased over the course of the two-year trial, with the decline being substantial for balansa clover. The present study confirmed that a high legume content of pastures leads to greater lamb growth rates. Total annual yields of pastures that had greater legume contents were superior to others (p < .05). Thus, a combination of self-regenerating annual clovers with perennial legumes in pasture mixtures may ensure a higher legume content and longer persistence in dryland hill pastures.																			0142-5242	1365-2494				MAR	2021	76	1					159	172		10.1111/gfs.12497	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gfs.12497		AUG 2020											WOS:000563328200001
J	Quichimbo, EA; Singer, MB; Cuthbert, MO				Quichimbo, Edisson A.; Singer, Michael B.; Cuthbert, Mark O.			Characterising groundwater-surface water interactions in idealised ephemeral stream systems	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Transmission losses from the beds of ephemeral streams are thought to be a widespread mechanism of groundwater recharge in arid and semi-arid regions and support a range of dryland hydro-ecology. Dryland areas cover similar to 40% of the Earth's land surface and groundwater resources are often the main source of freshwater. It is commonly assumed that where an unsaturated zone exists beneath a stream, the interaction between surface water and groundwater is unidirectional and that groundwater does not exert a significant feedback on transmission losses. To test this assumption, we conducted a series of numerical model experiments using idealised two-dimensional channel-transects to assess the sensitivity and degree of interaction between surface and groundwater for typical dryland ephemeral stream geometries, hydraulic properties and flow regimes. We broaden the use of the term 'stream-aquifer interactions' to refer not just to fluxes and water exchange but also to include the ways in which the stream and aquifer have a hydraulic effect on one another. Our results indicate that deep water tables, less frequent streamflow events and/or highly permeable sediments tend to result in limited bi-directional hydraulic interaction between the stream and the underlying groundwater which, in turn, results in high amounts of infiltration. With shallower initial depth to the water table, higher streamflow frequency and/or lower bed permeability, greater 'negative' hydraulic feedback from the groundwater occurs which in turn results in lower amounts of infiltration. Streambed losses eventually reach a constant rate as initial water table depths increase, but only at depths of 10s of metres in some of the cases studied. Our results highlight that bi-directional stream-aquifer hydraulic interactions in ephemeral streams may be more widespread than is commonly assumed. We conclude that groundwater and surface water should be considered as connected systems for water resource management unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.

Methods: Thirty-four patients with CVD (C3,Ep,As,Pr) were included in the study and randomly assigned to perform a standardized exercise protocol in a DL environment (DL group) or in a thermal water (TW group) from a natural hot spring at 33 degrees C with a high mineral content. Leg volumetry, ankle range of motion (ROM), ultrasound-detected subcutaneous tissue and great saphenous vein (GSV) diameter were assessed. Quality of life was measured by VVSymQ and CIVIQ-20. Results: After five TW sessions the average volume decrease was -432.4 +/- 122.4 mL (P<.0001) in the right leg and -358.8 +/- 109.3 mL (P<.0001) in the left. No significant volume change was reported at the end of the five sessions in DL. In TW, the subcutaneous tissue thickness significantly decreased (all assessment points P<.0001 right and P<.0001 left). In contrast, no significant changes were found in the DL group. The TW group showed a significant great saphenous vein caliber reduction, both in the right and left legs (6.2 +/- 5.9%, P<.002; 6.1 +/- 2.2%, P<.0001), whereas in the DL group no significant differences were found. After five sessions, ankle ROM significantly increased in both groups, both in dorsiflexion and in plantarflexion (right leg: TWdorsiflexion P<.0001, TWplantarflexion P<.0001; DLdorsiflexion P<.003, DLplantarflexion P<.007) (left leg: TWdorsiflexion P<.0001, TWplantarflexion P<.0001; DLdorsiflexion P<.006, DLplantarflexion P<.001). Only the TW group showed a linear correlation between volume and ankle ROM variation (right leg: R-2 = 0.80, R-2 = 0.75, P<.0001; left leg: R-2 = 0.82, R-2 = 0.81, P<.0001). The VVSymQ and CIVQ20 scores significantly improved in TW (P<.0001 and P<.0001, respectively), whereas DL showed a significant improvement only in CIVQ20 score (P<.02). Conclusions: Thermal aquatic immersion enhances the clinical benefits of a standardized exercise protocol for patients with CVD. Compared with the data available in the literature on non-TW, the present investigation shows a potential role of higher density types of water in lower limb volume control. Intense and rigorous data collection is needed to move from empirical evidence to evidence-based science in TW, a potentially very useful treatment modality for CVD.

This study was designed to better understand dryland salinity as a natural phenomenon and a potential consequence of land use changes, in order to avoid adverse economic and environmental impacts. A total of 28 wells at two study sites located nearby Loma Plata were monitored approximately every two weeks for groundwater conductivity and water table level, following transects from sown pasture to native forest and topographic gradients from bush or pasture to a nearby temporarily flooded lagoon. Results show a relation among topography, land cover, precipitation, groundwater salinity and surface salinization. Under pasture, groundwater was less saline in the average and the water table was slightly higher than under adjacent forest. Under forest, infiltrating rainwater never reached groundwater level, whereas under pasture, rainwater diluted the groundwater at several occasions during the observation period. Along the topographic gradients, there was a fringe prone to surface salinization along the borderline of the lagoon. At higher topographic levels, the saline ground water was low enough to not reach the surface by capillary ascension. On the other hand, high water table in the center of the lagoon fed by inflowing rainwaters (which had a slightly higher altitude level than the water table under adjacent land covers), displaced the saline groundwater vertically and horizontally. These findings provide information for land use planning in the region, which is prone to dryland salinity due to a generally high saline water table.

Changes in precipitation patterns can have large effects on dryland agricultural production, but experimental tests on the effects of changing precipitation intensity are limited. Over 3 years, we tested the effects of increased precipitation intensity on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.; Promontory variety) in a temperate dryland agricultural system that was on a rotation of crop and fallow years. We used 11 (2.1 x 2.5 m) shelters to collect and redeposit rain and snow as larger, more intense events. Total precipitation was the same in all plots, but event sizes in each plot varied from 1 to 18 mm. Treatments increased soil water availability, but winter wheat biomass and grain yield did not differ among treatments. Similarly, other measured plant growth responses, including vegetation greenness, leaf area index, canopy temperature, photochemical efficiency, root area, and new root growth, did not differ among treatments. Results indicate that at least in the semiarid climate and silt loam soils studied here, anticipated increases in precipitation intensity are unlikely to affect winter wheat production negatively. Further, increased precipitation intensity may mitigate water stress caused by increasing temperatures and encourage the use of wheat varieties that utilize deeper, later season soil water.					kulmatiski, andrew/J-2072-2015	kulmatiski, andrew/0000-0001-9977-5508; Holdrege, Martin/0000-0003-4078-6012														2073-4395				APR	2021	11	4							751	10.3390/agronomy11040751	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11040751													WOS:000642658400001

The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential of conservation agriculture in Pakistan's subtropical dryland to reduce atmospheric CO2 enrichment and alter soil organic carbon fractions. In a field experiment, fallow-wheat (farmers' practice) and the conservation tillage methods minimum tillage (MT), reduced tillage (RT), and zero tillage (ZT) were compared to conventional tillage (CT) in the main plots and the cropping systems sorghum-wheat (S-W) and mungbean-wheat (M-W) to fallow-wheat (F-W) in the sub-plots. Multiple assessments taken over a two-year period revealed that CT plots lacked greater soil organic carbon and its fractions than ZT and RT plots. In comparison to CT, ZT, and RT exhibited higher average total organic carbon (TOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), particulate organic carbon (POC), and mineral-associated organic carbon (MOC) concentrations, respectively, of 1.43% and 1.31%, 4.61% and 2.83%, 2.42% and 1.97%, and 1.66% and 1.76%. In comparison to the S-W cropping system, the F-W and M-W cropping systems showed increased MBC and MOC, but POC and TOC were little impacted. The maximum TOC (0.589% and 0.589%), MBC (0.021% and 0.021%), POC (0.195% and 0.192%), and MOC (0.489% and 0.485%) were found in the combinations of ZT with F-W and M-W. Regardless of the cropping systems, cumulative CO2 flow was lowest in ZT plots compared to the other tillage techniques. The CENTURY model confirmed that the use of continuous tillage is a major threat to both soil fertility and production. The study, therefore, concludes that ZT and RT systems in particular are potential possibilities for carbon sequestration in subtropical dryland soils for CO2 reduction.																			1161-0301	1873-7331				JUL	2023	147								126840	10.1016/j.eja.2023.126840	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2023.126840		APR 2023											WOS:001012719100001

Corn yield response to irrigation level, crop rotation, and irrigation system	JOURNAL OF CROP IMPROVEMENT												Economic sustainability is a result of efficient crop management, irrigation system selection, proper crop rotation, and crop yield. A long-term corn (Zea mays L.) yield research project was conducted in Southwest Georgia, USA (84 degrees 36"W, 30 degrees 44"N) during the 2001 to 2018 crop years, which compared four corn crop rotations, three irrigation systems, and three irrigation levels. Drip and overhead irrigation systems, along with a dryland control, were implemented. Drip systems included shallow subsurface drip (S3DI) and subsurface drip irrigation (SSDI). Irrigation levels included dryland, 33%, 50%, 62/66%, and 100% of estimated water use. Crop rotations were 1) peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.)-corn-corn, 2) peanut-corn, 3) peanut-corn-cotton, (Gossypium hirsutum L.), and 4) peanut-corn-corn-cotton. There were yield differences due to crop rotation; however, the differences were not consistent across years, irrigation levels, or irrigation systems. The SSDI system had consistently lower yield (9659 kg/ha) than both the S3DI (11,791 kg/ha) and sprinkler (12,230 kg/ha) at 100% irrigation level when averaged across all crop rotations and years. In wet years, irrigation level had no effect on yield due to total rainfall amount and timing. However, in dry years, corn yield for sprinkler and SSDI were influenced by irrigation level but not always for S3DI. When selecting an irrigation system, long-term yield should not be the only criterion but should consider crop rotation, system installation cost, field size, irrigation system controls, and irrigation and crop system management.																			1542-7528	1542-7536				SEP 3	2022	36	5					701	716		10.1080/15427528.2021.2005212	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15427528.2021.2005212		NOV 2021											WOS:000719798500001

Seedling responses to soil moisture amount versus pulse frequency in a successfully encroaching semi-arid shrub	OECOLOGIA												Rainfall timing, frequency, and quantity is rapidly changing in dryland regions, altering dryland plant communities. Understanding dryland plant responses to future rainfall scenarios is crucial for implementing proactive management strategies, particularly in light of land cover changes concurrent with climate change. One such change is woody plant encroachment, an increasing abundance of woody plants in areas formerly dominated by grasslands or savannas. Continued woody plant encroachment will depend, in part, on seedling capacity to establish and thrive under future climate conditions. Seedling performance is primarily impacted by soil moisture conditions governed by precipitation amount (quantity) and frequency. We hypothesized that (H1) seedling performance would be enhanced by both greater soil moisture and pulse frequency, such that seedlings with similar mean soil moisture would perform best under high pulse frequency. Alternatively, (H2) mean soil moisture would have greater influence than pulse frequency, such that a given pulse frequency would have little influence on seedling performance. The hypotheses were tested with Prosopis velutina, a shrub native to the United States that has encroached throughout its range and is invasive in other continents. Seedlings were grown in a greenhouse under two soil moisture treatments, each which was maintained by two pulse frequency treatments. Contrary to H1, mean soil moisture had greater impact than pulse frequency on seedling growth, photosynthetic gas exchange, leaf chemistry, and biomass allocation. These results indicate that P. velutina seedlings may be more responsive to rainfall amount than frequency, at least within the conditions seedlings experienced in this experimental manipulation.

Broad-Scale Patterns of Soil Carbon (C) Pools and Fluxes Across Semiarid Ecosystems are Linked to Climate and Soil Texture	ECOSYSTEMS												Dryland (semiarid and arid) ecosystems are responsible for most of the interannual variation in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and contain a considerable fraction of the globe's soil carbon (C) stock. Despite their important contribution to the global land C sink, we have a poor mechanistic understanding of the processes that drive C cycling patterns in drylands. In this study in eastern Utah, we examined the natural variation of soil C pools and fluxes along semiorthogonal gradients of climate and soil texture in order to determine the pertinent environmental controls on soil C cycling dynamics. Our study revealed a high degree of collinearity among C stocks and fluxes, which were related to climate, vegetation, and soil clay content. Soil C pools were positively correlated with both soil clay content and precipitation, which in turn was linked to aboveground plant biomass. By contrast, enzyme activities were negatively associated with temperature. We observed a strong decoupling of C pools and fluxes (for example, total C, DOC, microbial biomass C, and respiration) from the enzyme activities involved in organic matter decomposition. Overall, our findings indicate that the within- and between-site variation of soil C pools across diverse dryland ecosystems was strongly linked to both climate and edaphic characteristics, but the high degree of local variability within sites could challenge interpretations of environmental controls at broader scales.

Drought resistance and resilience: The role of soil moisture-plant interactions and legacies in a dryland ecosystem	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												In many regions of the world, climate change is projected to reduce water availability through changes in the hydrological cycle, including more frequent and intense droughts, as well as seasonal shifts in precipitation. In water-limited ecosystems, such as drylands, lower soil water availability may exceed the adaptive capacity of many organisms, leading to cascading ecological effects during (concurrent effects) and after drought (legacy effects). The magnitude and duration of concurrent and legacy effects depends on drought intensity, duration and timing as well as the resistance and resilience of the ecosystem. Here, we investigated the effects of drought seasonality and plant community composition on two dominant perennial grasses, Achnatherum hymenoides (C-3 photosynthesis) and Pleuraphis jamesii (C-4 photosynthesis), in a dryland ecosystem. The experiment consisted of three precipitation treatments: control (ambient precipitation), cool-season drought (-66% ambient precipitation November-April) and warm-season drought (-66% ambient precipitation May-October), applied in two plant communities (perennial grasses with or without a large shrub, Ephedra viridis) over a 3-year period. We examined the concurrent and legacy effects of seasonal drought on soil moisture, phenology and biomass. Drought treatments had strong concurrent and legacy effects on soil moisture, which impacted the phenology and biomass of the two grasses. Drought reduced growing season length by delaying green-up (cool-season drought) or advancing senescence (warm-season drought) and reduced biomass for both species. Biomass and phenology legacy effects from drought emerged in the second and third years of the experiment. While we observed differential sensitivity to drought legacies between the two grasses, we found limited evidence that shrub presence had interactive effects with the drought treatment. Synthesis. The results from this study highlight how abiotic and biotic legacies can develop and influence a community's resistance and resilience to subsequent droughts. When the frequency of repeated extreme events, such as recurring seasonal droughts, exceeds the capacity of organisms or ecosystems to recover (i.e. resilience), persistent drought legacies can reduce the resistance to subsequent drought events. Overall, these results highlight how drought legacies are a product of ecological resistance and resilience to past drought and can influence ecosystem vulnerability to future droughts.

During the winter season of 2017-2019 in which three sowing methods were applied: wide space sowing (WSS), furrow sowing (FS) and drill sowing (DS) along with four nitrogen levels (150 kg center dot hm(-1), 225 kg center dot hm(-1), 300 kg center dot hm(-1) and 375 kg center dot hm(-1)). The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of tillage condition on nitrogen, production and consumption, protein content/yield and grain yield of dryland wheat. The wide space sowing method has extremely significant effects on the number of ears, thousand grain weight and yield of winter wheat and also it significantly increased nitrogen absorption efficiency by 50%, nitrogen fertilizer production efficiency by 51%, the number of ears and yield were also significantly increased by 22%, 46% and the content of protein, globulin, gliadin and gluten in grains were the highest in furrow sowing, while the yield of albumin and grain protein were the highest in wide space sowing. The wide space sowing WSS and a nitrogen level of 300 kg center dot hm(-1) was beneficial to increase water consumption during the growth period, also to increase the tiller dynamics, improve the dry matter quality of the plant, and to improve nitrogen absorption and nitrogen fertilizer production efficiency by increasing grain protein.

Seed priming and foliar nutrition spray at various stages of growth have both been shown to be beneficial in lowering stress and improving wheat grain production. For this reason, this experiment was conducted in the form of split plots in a randomized complete block design with two factors including seed priming (Main factor) and foliar application (Sub-factor), and 3 replications during the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 cropping seasons. Eight seed priming treatments including control (without seed priming), water (hydro-priming), urea (2%), zinc sulfate (0.6%), potassium chloride (1%), calcium chloride (1.4%), vitaspirin (1 g L-1), and cytokinin (50 mg L-1) were randomized on the main plot, and 3 foliar application treatments including control (without foliar application), urea (4%), and vitaspirin (0.1%) were randomized on a sub-plot. The results showed that the thousand kernel weight had not had much effect on grain yield in this experiment. Furthermore, treatments that increased the number of grains had a positive impact on enhancing grain yield. In the 2020-2019 cropping season, none of the seed priming treatments enhanced grain yield because of temperature and rainfall constraints. This demonstrated the role of early growth conditions in the effectiveness of seed priming treatments. As a result, seed priming treatments without foliar application under dryland conditions cannot be recommended due to the unpredictability of weather conditions. In both cropping seasons, seed priming with calcium chloride + foliar application of vitaspirin was one of the top three treatments in terms of grain yield.																			0133-3720	1788-9170				SEP	2023	51	3					761	771		10.1007/s42976-022-00318-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42976-022-00318-6		DEC 2022											WOS:000912598500001

BP) represents the first Neolithic settlements in the middle Yellow River Valley, marking the beginning of millet and rice farming in the region. While previous studies have focused primarily on identifying cultivated cereals, less attention has been given to plant harvesting and processing practices or environmental conditions. To address this gap, we present new phytolith data from the Peiligang site (8000-7600 cal. BP) to make three key contributions. First, we show that the Peiligang people utilized two microhabitats: hillslopes for dryland millet cultivation and alluvial plain for wetland resources. Second, we combine our findings with other archaeological evidence to reconstruct the environmental conditions of the Peiligang site, suggesting that it was a water-rich habitat. Finally, by analyzing phytolith remains of plant processing waste in middens, we reconstruct how people harvested and processed millets and rice at the site. This study sheds light on the plant-based subsistence strategies employed by the Peiligang people and offers insights into the environmental factors that contributed to the development of early farming in the middle Yellow River Valley.

Many of these species originate from temperate to subarctic climates and occur across wide elevations in their native range, and so arrived predisposed to adapt to a variety of habitats and bioclimatic zones in their new environs, including the alpine zone. Almost all of New Zealand's invasive small mammal species have been recorded in the country's alpine zones, yet neither the altitudinal distribution nor the extent to which such species use high elevation areas has been clearly defined. We conducted extensive camera trap surveys in summer to autumn periods of 2019 and 2020 across an elevation range of 500-2250 m above sea level, and used detection rates and occupancy modelling to reveal the altitudinal distributions and habitat associations of all 10 invasive small mammals that occur in the dryland zone of the central South Island. We found altitudinal distributions varied greatly across species, and that while most exhibited decreasing detection rates and site occupancy probabilities with increasing elevation, some used the subalpine and alpine zones to a greater degree than adjacent lower elevations. There were clear habitat associations, as well as interspecific associations that helped to explain the altitudinal distribution of some species. Understanding how such factors influence the distribution of invasive small mammals has both broad implications for invasive species management, and direct applications in evaluating threats to native taxa, advancing management strategies, and benchmarking distributions in a changing climate.					; Seddon, Philip/G-8659-2011	/0000-0002-9449-2952; Maloney, Richard/0000-0002-1699-763X; Seddon, Philip/0000-0001-9076-9566; Foster, Nicholas/0000-0002-5233-6118; Khan, Md Saiful/0000-0003-2742-1086													1387-3547	1573-1464				JUN	2021	23	6					1837	1857		10.1007/s10530-021-02474-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-021-02474-y		MAR 2021											WOS:000625743800003
J	Soliveres, S; Eldridge, DJ				Soliveres, Santiago; Eldridge, David J.			Dual community assembly processes in dryland biocrust communities	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												Biocrusts are critical components of drylands where they regulate a wide range of ecosystem functions, however, their response to the world-wide phenomenon of shrub encroachment and to livestock grazing, the most extensive land use in drylands, is not well studied. Grazing by livestock and increases in shrub cover could influence biocrust communities directly via trampling or shading, or indirectly, by altering biotic interactions amongst biocrust taxa. The extent of these changes in biocrust cover, diversity and composition are poorly known. We used linear models and structural equation modelling to examine the direct effects of grazing and shrubs on biocrust community composition and the indirect effects mediated by changes in species interactions. Biocrust richness and cover increased with increasing shrub cover at the site level. This pattern occurred despite the negative response we found (lower cover and richness) under shrub patches versus open areas, which was consistent irrespective of the grazing level. Functional diversity and evenness were similar between shrubs and open at low grazing intensity, but at high grazing functional diversity was greater in the open. Competition between biocrust species was an important driver of their community assembly irrespective of shrub cover, grazing intensity or patch type. Structural equation models showed that the effects of grazing and shrub cover on functional evenness, functional diversity and richness were controlled by biotic interactions within the shrub microsites. In the open, however, these effects were either direct or mediated by changes in cover. Biocrust cover, species richness and functional diversity increase with shrub cover at the site scale, despite the negative effects at the microsite level. We demonstrate here that drivers of community assembly differ markedly at small spatial scales. Though biocrust communities were directly driven by environmental filtering in the open, biotic interactions played a fundamental role in their assembly when growing beneath shrubs.

J	Leng, XJ; Feng, XM; Fu, BJ				Leng, Xuejing; Feng, Xiaoming; Fu, Bojie			Driving forces of agricultural expansion and land degradation indicated by Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) data in drylands from 2000 to 2015	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Drylands account for 41% of the world's terrestrial surface, affect more than two billion people, and play a crucial role in global circulation and even global climate change. Therefore, the investigation of agricultural expansion and land degradation regions is a critical part of understanding the human-land coupling systems in dryland ecosystems. The specific distributions of agricultural expansion or land degradation in arid areas were obtained by using three indicators of global Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) data, in which expanding agriculture is usually characterized by tree canopy (TC) loss and short vegetation (SV) gain, while land degradation is characterized by a decrease in short vegetation and an increase in bare ground (BG). Assessing the partial correlation of natural or socioeconomic factors and indicators of agricultural expansion or land degradation while the structural equation model was established, we found that (1) the vegetation situation in the global arid region is relatively stable, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) value in the Asian arid region is increasing annually; (2) precipitation in the global arid region has a highly positive correlation with TC and a highly negative correlation with BG, while temperature is strongly correlated with SV except in arid areas; (3) both agricultural expansion and land degradation regions are dominated by natural factors, especially temperature; and (4) the control of socioeconomic factors is not closely related to the original land use/cover types in dryland regions.

They are characterized by less precipitation, with vulnerable and sensitive ecosystems. Although they are located in the heart of continent, precipitation in these regions has opposite patterns on the multi-decadal time scale. In this study, we focus on different responses of precipitation changes in these drylands and related drought to different phases of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) on the multi-decadal time scale. We show that less precipitation in the CAD and more precipitation in the EAD were always associated with a positive AMO phase, which was caused by the weakened westerly and simultaneous enhancement of vertically integrated water vapor from the Indian Ocean and western Pacific. Such precipitation pattern was accompanied by a drying (wetting) phase of self-calibrating Palmer's drought severity index in the CAD (EAD), which further contributed to a worse (better) ecology in the CAD (EAD). This explains why the positive AMO phase in recent decades starting from 2000 made a positive contribution to the drying (wetting) arid region in the CAD (EAD).

However, their distribution patterns and driving factors, particularly, the relative importance of climate, plant and soil factors, remain largely unknown. This limits our understanding of soil protist roles in ecosystem functions and their responses to climate change. This is particularly a concern in dryland ecosystems where soil microbiomes are more important for ecosystem functions because plant diversity and growth are heavily constrained by environmental stresses. Here, we explored protist diversity and their driving factors in grassland soils on the Tibetan Plateau, which is a typical dryland region with yearly low temperatures. Soil protist diversity significantly decreased along the gradient of meadow, steppe, and desert. Soil protist diversity positively correlated with precipitation, plant biomass and soil nutrients, but these correlations were changed by grazing. Structural equation and random forest models demonstrated that precipitation dominated soil protist diversity directly and indirectly by influencing plant and soil factors. Soil protist community structure gradually shifted along meadow, steppe and desert, and was driven more by precipitation than by plant and soil factors. Soil protist community compositions were dominated by Cercozoa, Ciliophora and Chlorophyta. In particular, Ciliophora increased but Chlorophyta decreased in relative abundance along the gradient of meadow, steppe and desert. These results demonstrate that precipitation plays more important roles in driving soil protist diversity and community structure than plant and soil factors, suggesting that future precipitation change profoundly alters soil protist community and functions in dry grasslands.

J	Fu, W; Fan, J; Hao, MD; Hu, JS; Wang, H				Fu, Wei; Fan, Jun; Hao, Mingde; Hu, Jinsheng; Wang, Huan			Evaluating the effects of plastic film mulching patterns on cultivation of winter wheat in a dryland cropping system on the Loess Plateau, China	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Plastic film mulching (PFM) can increase or stabilize crop yields worldwide when applied to agricultural planting systems, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. Although the adverse effects that are caused by residual plastic film, such as plastic pollution, are becoming a global concern, the application of PFM will not be replaced by other materials in the short-term in agriculture. It is important to understand the various PFM patterns (different mulching periods and coverage rates) that impact on soil physicochemical properties and characteristics of crop growth. Therefore, based on a field experiment that we established in 2002, we conducted consecutive field observations from 2013 to 2016 to determine the optimum PFM mulching period and coverage rate. Three mulching periods were included: (I) summer fallow period (FM), (II) growth period (GM), and (III) whole growth year (WM). Two coverage rates were included: (i) 50%, half mulching (HM), and (ii) 100%, total mulching (TM). That is, there were six different PFM treatments. No mulching (NM) over the growth years was considered the CK treatment. PFM increased canopy height and leaf area index of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the growing season by 29.5% and 19.4%, respectively. Average winter wheat grain yields of various PFM patterns were 5318.5 kg ha(-1) and 4557.7 kg ha(-1) in 2013-2014 and 2015-2016, respectively; these yields were 13.8% and 23.7% higher than NM in 2013-2014 and 2015-2016, respectively. However, the difference in the growth characteristics and grain yield of winter wheat under various PFM patterns resulted from the change in the mulching period and coverage rate. Winter wheat grain yield and biomass increased with GM and WM compared with FM and NM in normal rainfall years. PFM coverage rates improved yield significantly (P < 0.05) and influenced soil nutrient concentrations. HM maintained or increased soil organic matter (SOM) and total nitrogen concentrations, but TM decreased SOM concentration by 8.3%. Water use efficiency (WUE) and rainfall use efficiency (RUE) were improved by various PFM patterns. Furthermore, WM had the most significant impact on SOM concentrations, GM was second, and FM was minor. Considering the costs and benefits of PFM patterns, the half coverage rate of PFM during the whole year (FWH) had the best index (BI) value, and the total coverage rate of PFM during the growth period (FGT) and the half coverage rate of PFM during the growth period (FGH) had higher BI values than other PFM patterns; the values for BI for FWH, FGT, and FGH were 10.3, 8.9, and 8.5, respectively. In conclusion, ignoring the amount of PFM pollution in the environment (or use biodegradable film instead of polyethylene film), FWH was the best PFM pattern with the highest WUE and RUE in dryland rainfed agriculture. But, to decrease the amount of PFM application and pollution, FGH was more beneficial for soil health with a low coverage rate and short mulching period. FGH was the optimal pattern for PFM when applied to winter wheat on the Loess Plateau, China based on our field experiment.

With-in season emission of soil CO2 from croplands are affected by changes in weather, tillage, plant row spacing, and plant growth stage. Tillage involves physical turning of soils which accelerate residue decomposition and CO2 emission. No-tillage lacks soil disturbance and residues undergo slower decomposition at the surface. In this study, we compared with-in season soil conditions (temperature and moisture) and soil respiration from two major crops (soybean and winter wheat) by making high temporal frequency measurements using automated chambers at half-hourly intervals. The experiment lasted for 179 days. Total number of measurements made from conventional and no-tillage soybean and winter wheat plots were 6480 and 4456, respectively. Average flux after the winter-dormancy period of wheat was 37% higher in tilled soil compared to no-till soil. However, average flux during the soybean growing season was 8% lower in conventional till compared to no-till soil. This differential response of soil respiration in wheat and soybean was primarily due to tillage-induced changes in surface characteristics (residue cover) and soil environmental conditions (soil temperature and soil moisture). Results from this study can help elucidate relationships for modeling and assessment of field-scale soil CO2 emissions from dryland wheat and soybean crops grown in sub-tropics.

Here, we exploited the complementary use of optical and passive microwave satellite data- normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and vegetation optical depth (VOD)-to provide new insights of ecosystem changes in African drylands. During 1993-2012, 54% of African drylands experienced a significant increase of VOD, mainly located in southern Africa and west and central Africa, with an average rate of increase of (1.2 +/- 2.7) x 10(-3) yr(-1). However, a significant decreasing NDVI was observed over 43% of the African drylands, in particular in western Niger and eastern Africa, with an average browning rate of (-0.13 +/- 1.5) x 10(-3) yr(-1). The contrasting vegetation trends (increasing VOD and decreasing NDVI) were largely caused by an increase in the relative proportion of the woody component of the vegetation, as a result of the prevailing woody encroachment in African drylands during the study period. Soil water emerges as the dominant driver of ecosystem changes in African drylands, in particular in arid and semiarid areas. This is evidenced by a strong spatio-temporal correlation between soil water and vegetation, where soil water changes explain about 48% of vegetation variations. This study emphasizes the potential of utilizing multiple satellite products with different strengths in monitoring different characteristics of ecosystems to evaluate ecosystem changes and reveal the underlying mechanisms of the observed changes.

In this regard, a new scheme, that uses three sets of irrigation depth and numerically simulated cumulative transpiration, was evaluated in the Egyptian Nile delta in 2020. Presuming that water is volumetrically priced, the proposed scheme can maximize net incomes at optimum irrigation depths considering quantitative weather forecasts. A field experiment was carried out with a randomized complete block design using a major crop, maize, to assess the feasibility of the proposed scheme in comparison to a sensor-based irrigation method under conditions of dry climate and clay loamy soil. The proposed scheme could increase the gross net income of farmers and conserve irrigation by 21% and 35%, respectively, compared to a sensor-based irrigation method, although the yield and its components were almost the same with no significant statistical differences. The model could accurately simulate soil water content in the topsoil layers with a RMSE of 0.02 cm(3) cm(-3). The proposed scheme could be a useful tool to spare the costs of expensive soil monitoring sensors while saving water and improving net income.					Baki, Hassan M.

Many woody species develop adaptive mechanisms in response to water stress. This study assesses survival rate, growth and dry matter distribution in response to water stress in four dryland species (Senegalia dudgeonii, Senegalia gourmaensis, Vachellia nilotica and Vachellia tortilis). A total of 240 seedlings (60 per species) were grown using a completely randomized block design with three replicates in each of three water treatments (control = 100 percent of field capacity; moderate water stress = 50 percent of field capacity; severe water stress = 25 percent of field capacity) with a 7 day watering frequency. Data were collected on seedling survival, height, collar diameter, leaf production and dry matter distribution. Survival rate of the four species was not affected by water stress. However, the morphological responses to water stress were significantly different between species. Water stress resulted in significant reductions in height and collar diameter, higher below-ground biomass and significant increase in shedding of leaves. Under water stress, S. dudgeonii, S. gourmaensis and V. tortilis invested more in root growth. The allocation pattern from above-ground to below-ground parts was found to be the main adaption to drought. In contrast, V. nilotica gave preference to above-ground development, which could be an indication that the seedlings are adapted to grow under severe water stress. The results confirm the interspecific genetic differences in growth and dry matter distribution among species.

Global climate change has an impact on the water cycle and can result in an increase in ET from the land surface; nevertheless, an increase in ET can destabilize the macro- and micro-climate at the local and continental levels. In line with this, the purpose of this article is to learn more about the factors that contribute to the high and current reference ET (ET o ) rate of Karakalpakstan (Uzbekistan). MODIS Terra images was used to analyze long-term land cover change. The Google Earth Engine code editor, Erdas Imagine 2020, and ArcMap 10.8 were used to map land cover change and the leaf area index (LAI). Though the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index were used because of their past performance as affirmative measurement techniques for vegetation monitoring. The HargreavesSamani equation was utilized to ET o in this study. Increased crop density in agriculture and the conversion of barren soil to grasslands to rehabilitate the seashore ecosystem of the Aral Sea influenced LAI significantly, according to multifactorial analyses of perennial air temperature, land cover change, solar irradiance, and ET o in a typical dryland of Uzbekistan. However, the extension of LAI in the agricultural area of Karakalpakstan substantially accelerated the ET o rate, which was a key contributor of an increase in crop water demand. We can see that measured solar radiation and ET o were consistent across time by looking at the nearly same quantities for both. As a result, we assume that global climatic changes have no effect in the uncertainty of solar radiation and ET rate.& COPY; 2023 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

Cereal and oil seed crops response to organic nitrogen when grown in rotation with annual aerial-seeded pasture legumes	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE												Nitrogen fixation from pasture legumes is a fundamental process that contributes to the profitability and sustainability of dryland agricultural systems. The aim of this research was to determine whether well-managed pastures, based on aerial-seeding pasture legumes, could partially or wholly meet the nitrogen (N) requirements of subsequent grain crops in an annual rotation. Fifteen experiments were conducted in Western Australia with wheat, barley or canola crops grown in a rotation that included the pasture legume species French serradella (Ornithopus sativus), biserrula (Biserrula pelecinus), bladder clover (Trifolium spumosum), annual medics (Medicago spp.) and the non-aerial seeded subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum). After the pasture phase, five rates of inorganic N fertilizer (Urea, applied at 0, 23, 46, 69 and 92 kg/ha) were applied to subsequent cereal and oil seed crops. The yields of wheat grown after serradella, biserrula and bladder clover, without the use of applied N fertilizer, were consistent with the target yields for growing conditions of the trials (2.3 to 5.4 t/ha). Crop yields after phases of these pasture legume species were similar or higher than those following subterranean clover or annual medics. The results of this study suggest a single season of a legume-dominant pasture may provide sufficient organic N in the soil to grow at least one crop, without the need for inorganic N fertilizer application. This has implications for reducing inorganic N requirements and the carbon footprint of cropping in dryland agricultural systems.

However, it is still unclear how different plantations influence the carbon sink and how they respond to environmental factors, especially in drylands. In this study, eddy correlation method (EC) was used to measure carbon and water fluxes and environmental factors of two artificial forests (Larix principis-rupprechtii and Pinus tabulaeformis) in the dryland of Northwest China, and the responses of evapotranspiration (ET), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary productivity (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (RECO) to environmental factors were also assessed. Results showed that the L. principis-rupprechtii forest ecosystem had higher water use efficiency (WUE), light use efficiency (LUE), GPP, and RECO than the P. tabulaeformis forest ecosystem. However, the proportion of net ecosystem production (NEP) to GPP in the P. tabulaeformis forest ecosystem (62.89%) was higher than that in the L. principis-rupprechtii forest ecosystem (47.49%), indicating that the P. tabulaeformis forest ecosystem had the higher carbon sequestration efficiency. In addition, the CO2 and H2O fluxes in the L. principis-rupprechtii forest ecosystem were more sensitive to environmental factors, compared with the P. tabulaeformis forest ecosystem. Further, the RECO of the L. principis-rupprechtii forest ecosystem was more sensitive to temperature changes, which implies that the L. principis-rupprechtii forest ecosystem will release more CO2 than the P. tabulaeformis forest ecosystem with a warming climate. Therefore, the P. tabulaeformis forest ecosystem may have better carbon sequestration potential. These results are important for understanding the effects of climate change on the CO2 and H2O cycles in coniferous plantation ecosystems in drylands.					peng, jy/JMB-2297-2023; xuan, li/JNI-7432-2023; Li, Yage/HHD-2668-2022; li, bai/JNE-1502-2023; Yang, Xiaoming/GRJ-9483-2022	peng, jy/0000-0001-9665-1059; Yang, Xiaoming/0000-0002-1792-6921														1999-4907				MAY	2022	13	5							739	10.3390/f13050739	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f13050739													WOS:000801279000001

Understanding the impact of desertification reversion on terrestrial ecosystems, including vegetation greenness and photosynthetic capacity, is crucial for land policy-making and carbon-cycle model improvement. However, the phenomenon of desertification reversal is rarely mentioned in previous studies, which dramatically limits the understanding of vegetation dynamics in the arid area. Therefore, it is of great necessity to investigate the status of desertification reversal on the ecosystem in arid areas. In this study, we first reported the phenomenon of desertification reversion over the southern edge of the Gurbantunggut Desert through the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer classification map year by year. We discussed the consequences, ways, and causes of desertification reversion. Our results showed that the desertification reversal significantly increased vegetation greenness and photosynthetic capacity, which largely offset the negative impact of desertification on the ecosystem productivity; cropland expansion and grassland's natural restoration were the two main ways of desertification reversal; the improvement of soil-water condition was an essential environmental factor leading to the phenomenon of reverse desertification. This finding highlights the importance of desertification reversal in the carbon cycle of dryland ecosystems and prove that desertification reversal is an integral part of global and dryland vegetation greening.

Diet selection and preference of small ruminants during drought conditions in a dryland pastoral system in South Africa	SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH												Semi-arid to arid areas are prone to droughts which are frequent occurrences in South Africa's rangelands. Drought can trigger plant species compositional changes in rangelands thus influencing the availability and quality of forage for livestock. The availability and quality of forage drives livestock production, especially among pastoralists who mainly rely on the natural rangeland to sustain their livestock and livelihoods. The aim of this study was to determine the forage selection of cross-bred sheep, Swakara sheep (Ovis aries) and Boer goats (Capra hircus), during the wet season in the summer rainfall Nama Karoo and winter rainfall Succulent Karoo biomes in Namaqualand, South Africa. Since this dryland pastoral system was experiencing drought conditions during the study period of 2016 & 2017, the focus of the study was placed within this context to determine, (1) the availability of forage for small ruminants, (2) the nature of diet selection of different small ruminant groups and how it vary between the two biomes, and (3) the role livestock species, breeds and season play in forage preferences. We established diet selection, preference and dietary overlap by using direct observation of livestock grazing in the veld. Results indicate that availability of forage influence diet selection and preferences of all small ruminant groups. There was a high dietary overlap between mixed bred and Swakara sheep irrespective of the biomes. During 2016 annual herbs made up a large proportion of the sheep's diets indicating an overdependence to this forage resource when it became available in the rangeland. However, due to the drought spell extending into 2017, annual herbs became less available and therefore altered the forage choices of both sheep groups. Goats were primarily browsers in the Succulent Karoo biome where shrubs dominate, but were considered grazers in the Nama Karoo biome where grasses were dominant. Moreover, all small ruminant groups in this study showed non-selective grazing tendencies which is an important grazing management tool to ensure that rangeland resources are not over exploited. We conclude by arguing that the mixture of different livestock species by pastoralists is an effective diversification strategy for better use of rangelands with herbaceous and woody plants during drought periods.

Werner			Africa's drylands in a changing world: Challenges for wildlife conservation under climate and land-use changes in the Greater Etosha Landscape	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Proclaimed in 1907, Etosha National Park in northern Namibia is an iconic dryland system with a rich history of wildlife conservation and research. A recent research symposium on wildlife conservation in the Greater Etosha Landscape (GEL) highlighted increased concern of how intensification of global change will affect wildlife conservation based on participant responses to a questionnaire. The GEL includes Etosha and surrounding areas, the latter divided by a veteriland to the north. Here, we leverage our knowledge of this ecosystem to provide insight into the broader challenges facing wildlife conservation in this vulnerable dryland environment. We first cesses that drive dryland system dynamics. We then look forward, focusing on eight key areas of wildlife conflict, wildlife crime, and human dimensions of wildlife conservation. Using this Yet, despite these trends, a gap exists between the scope of recent research efforts and the needs of wildlife conservation to adapt to climate and land-use changes. Given the complex nature of research could be beneficial. One critical area for growth is to better integrate research and wildlife management across land-use types. Such efforts have the potential to support wildlife direct relevance for other African dryland systems impacted by global change.

However, only a few studies have investigated the effect of reducing nitrogen (N) application on the performance of maize and peanut crops in intercropping system based on rotation of the planting strip. Therefore, a field study was conducted from 2018 to 2020 in Yangling, China, where the treatments comprised peanut monoculture, maize monoculture, maize-peanut intercropping, mai-ze-peanut rotational intercropping, and maize N reduction based on the rotational intercropping system. The N accumulation and yield in maize increased after intercropping, while the N accumulation, yield and N fixation capacity of peanut decreased than other treatments. In addition, soil residual N, ammonia volatilization, N leaching, and N2O emissions of maize-peanut intercropping significantly decreased than maize monoculture. The rotation of planting strips in maize-peanut intercropping had increased the land equivalent ratio by 3.06 % and 9.39 % and N recovery efficiency by 15.45 % and 27.37 % in the second and third years of planting, as well as alleviated the continuous cropping barrier for peanuts. N reduction does not affect N fixation capacity and yield of peanut and reduces ammonia volatilization and N leaching from farmland, although it does influence maize yield. The optimal cropping system was a 20 % N reduction in maize planting strip under rotational inter -cropping because N accumulation and the farmland productivity were not affected significantly, while the N losses to the environment also decreased by an average of 44.17 % and 14.87 % compared with traditional intercropping and monoculture in the second and third years of planting. These results are useful for optimizing cropping systems to promote sustainable development in dryland regions and mitigate N pollution.

J	Noorisameleh, Z; Gough, WA; Mirza, MMQ				Noorisameleh, Zahra; Gough, William A.; Mirza, M. Monirul Qader			Persistence and spatial-temporal variability of drought severity in Iran	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Drought is a natural hazard that can inflict significant damage to agriculture, society, economy, and ecosystems. The assessment of the persistence of drought severity (PDS) assists in understanding the characteristics of droughts better and enables the development of associated prediction tools and models. This work explores the persistence and spatial-temporal variability of drought severity (DS) in the diverse dryland of Iran. Using monthly precipitation and temperature data of 44 synoptic stations from 1989 to 2018, relationships between DS coefficient of precipitation variation, aridity, and the persistence percentage are determined by the application of the standardized precipitation index (SPI), the dryland index, and the Hurst exponent (H). The results confirm the persistence of droughts in Iran as H exceeded the 0.5 threshold for all stations. The PDS average in Iran is 0.78 with high regional variability reflective of different climatic conditions and geographical locations. An inverse relationship exists between the long-term coefficient of variation of monthly precipitation and PDS in the hyper-arid and arid regions of watersheds. Higher PDS values and increasing trend in the DS are detected in dry-subhumid areas. Also, the effect of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a teleconnection metric, on the DS displays high spatial and temporal variability in Iran. The results show that the PDS is consistent with the spatial variation of DS changes during the period of 2009-2018.

J	Butterfield, BJ; Munson, SM				Butterfield, Bradley J.; Munson, Seth M.			Do seeding and seedling planting result in similar restored plant communities?	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												AimsRestoration practitioners often face a tradeoff between low cost but risky seeding vs expensive but more reliable seedling planting to meet revegetation goals. Knowing under what environmental and management conditions direct seeding vs seedling planting benefit different species could improve restoration practice.MethodsWe compared seed emergence to planted-seedling survival among perennial herbaceous species commonly used in restoration across eight experimental restoration sites on the Colorado Plateau, USA. We used linear models to assess relationships between emergence and survival among species, and to assess the effects of site climate and seeding pre-treatments on those relationships.ResultsWe found that among species, emergence was positively correlated with survival in the cooler sites, meaning that species with high emergence also had high survival and vice versa, but had no relationship in the hottest sites. Furthermore, pre-treatments to enhance soil moisture in seeded plots, specifically microtopography (pits) and mulch, also resulted in positive relationships between emergence and survival among species, while seeding without additional soil pre-treatments did not. Seedling planting cost 14 times as much as direct seeding alone, dropping to nine times as much when pre-treatments were combined with seeding.ConclusionsTaken together, these results suggest that investments in seedling planting at hotter dryland sites, or in creating microtopography or mulching prior to seeding across sites, are likely to promote establishment success compared to simple seeding methods in degraded dryland ecosystems. These findings also identify opportunities for hybrid seeding and planting approaches that balance tradeoffs between risk and cost, respectively. Restoration practitioners face a tradeoff between low cost but risky seeding vs expensive but more reliable seedling planting to meet revegetation goals. We show that investment in seedling planting, rather than seeding, is most beneficial at hotter sites, and that creating microtopography or mulching prior to seeding is necessary to achieve similar outcomes to seedling planting in degraded dryland ecosystems.image																			1402-2001	1654-109X				OCT	2023	26	4							e12758	10.1111/avsc.12758	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/avsc.12758													WOS:001119076800001

FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Improvements in wheat tillering in dry-land farming systems can be achieved by reducing soil water loss by straw mulching and enhancing the capability of wheat roots to capture soil water and N. However, the effects of the application of maize straw mulching in combination with uniconazole application on wheat tillering is not yet investigated. Field experiments were conducted during 2017-2018 (dry, 167 mm) and 2018-2019 (favorable, 222 mm) to investigate the combined effects of uniconazole (0 and 10 mg kg(-1)) and maize straw mulching (0 and 7500 kg ha(-1)) on soil water and root distribution, phytohormone signal transduction, total N uptake, plant N nutrition, tillering capability, and the expression of critical genes and metabolites in response to wheat tillering. Compared with no mulch control, straw mulching combined with uniconazole application increased soil moisture content and root length in the 0-20 cm soil layer and thereby increased total N uptake. Owing to allometric increases in aboveground N content and plant dry mass, uniconazole application combined with straw mulching increased the dry mass per kg N uptake and N nutrition index in the tillering and stem extension stages. Improved N nutrition index led to higher tiller emergence rate and tiller occurrence rate of first primary tillers and thus increased the number of fertile spikes and grain yield. Multi-omics integration analysis revealed that the increased tillering capability was associated with abscisic acid and gibberellic acid-mediated phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and glycerophospholipid metabolism because of their critical roles in lignin biosynthesis and the maintenance of cell membrane integrity in tiller node cells. The collective results indicate that maize straw mulching combined with uniconazole application improved the capability of wheat roots to capture soil moisture and N in addition to increasing lignin biosynthesis, ultimately enhancing tillering capability and grain yield of dryland winter wheat.

J	Wetzel, J; Stone, A				Wetzel, Jennifer; Stone, Alexandra			Yield Response of Winter Squash to Irrigation Regime and Planting Density	HORTSCIENCE												Consumers are increasingly interested in buying local vegetables in the fall and winter. Winter squash is an important vegetable crop for local and regional fall and winter markets, and consumers are increasingly seeking high-culinary value Cucurbita maxima types such as kabocha and buttercup. Although consumer demand for kabocha and buttercup squash is increasing, Oregon farmers report they are marginally profitable. The goals of this project were 1) to identify productive kabocha and buttercup varieties for western Oregon when grown with or without overhead irrigation and 2) to describe the effects of planting density on yield, fruit weight, number of fruit per hectare, and fruit per plant. Seven varieties of C. maxima winter squash, including kabochas and buttercups, and one interspecific (C. maxima 3 C. moschata) hybrid 'Tetsukabuto' were grown in a split-split plot randomized complete block design experiment with irrigation as the main plot, planting density as the subplot, and variety as the sub-subplot. Four replications of four different planting densities for eight varieties were grown in 2016 and 2017. Irrigated planting densities ranged from 8611-32,292 plants/ha (0.86-3.2 plants/m(2)) and dryland planting densities ranged from 3827-14,352 plants/ha (0.38-1.4 plants/m(2)) in 2016 and 5741-21,528 plants/ha (0.57-2.2 plants/m(2)) in 2017. The seven C. maxima types had statistically comparable yield under both irrigated and dryland production, with an average yield of 33.9 t.ha(-1) with irrigation and 19.4 t.ha(-1) without irrigation. Dryland yields in 2016 and 2017 were 76% and 37% of irrigated yields, respectively. 'Tetsukabuto' had the greatest yield (mean, 51.4 t.ha(-1)), the greatest number of fruit per hectare (mean, 12,080), and the greatest number of fruit per plant (mean, 1.94) when grown with irrigation, and yielded comparably with other varieties when grown in dryland production. Planting density impacted the fruit weight, number of fruit per hectare, and number of fruit per plant, although it did not impact yield statistically in both irrigated and dryland production. Average fruit weight decreased linearly from 1.89 to 1.30 kg for the irrigated trials, from 2.04 to 1.56 kg in the 2016 dryland trial, and from 1.42 to 0.93 kg in the 2017 dryland trial as planting density increased from 0.86 to 3.2, 0.38 to 1.4, and 0.57 to 2.2 plants/m(2), respectively. The number of fruit per hectare increased linearly from 6660 to 10,590 as the number of plants per hectare increased from 8611 to 32,292 plants/ha for the irrigated trials, because even at the lowest planting density, plants did not produce more than two fruit per plant on average across varieties when grown with irrigation. Farmers can manipulate squash fruit size to suit market preferences by changing planting density. The very low 2017 dryland yields were likely a result of unusually high summer temperatures in western Oregon. Increasingly hot summers may render dryland squash production unfeasible in this region.																			0018-5345	2327-9834				JUL	2019	54	7					1190	+		10.21273/HORTSCI13690-18	http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI13690-18													WOS:000478790100012

Effect of natural factors and management practices on agricultural water use efficiency under drought: A meta-analysis of global drylands	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Agriculture's need to feed the growing population is challenged by the decline in available water resources especially in the context of global climate change. Improving crop water use efficiency (WUE) will help to safeguard the environmental sustainability of food production in dryland areas. However, the impact of drought on crop WUE varies-a comprehensive and quantitative understanding of relevant factors is needed to support evidence-based management decisions. Here, we used a meta-analysis of global drylands (81 studies with 836 paired observations) to evaluate the response of various crop WUEs to drought based on various natural and human induced factors. Our results showed that responses of crop types' WUE varied under drought intensity, which probably a reference for crop selection in drylands. Cotton could be one of crop selection reference in hyper-arid or arid regions, and legume is not recommended for drylands without irrigation. Cereal crop are suitable for growing in semi-arid or dry sub-humid areas. Moreover, soil improvement and fertilizer management are the effective methods to alleviate drought stress, in addition to irrigation. Soil with medium-texture, 1.3-1.4 g cm(-3) bulk density and 15-20 g kg(-1) organic matter is beneficial for improving WUE under drought. Fertilizer should be carefully considered and not exceed 200 kg ha(-1) for wheat in drylands. Water deficit can improve crop WUE, but should not exceed 40% of the full irrigation amount. Field management practices, such as mulching and weed control, can help alleviate drought by regulating WUE to some extent. This study evaluated the responses of various crop WUEs to drought and highlighted the factors contributing to and/or decreasing crop WUE from natural factor and management practices, which provides a basis for agricultural drought mitigation strategies under future climate change in dryland areas.					杨, 杨/IUQ-0395-2023; yang, menghao/HPE-9850-2023; Siddique, Kadambot H.M./B-3462-2011	Siddique, Kadambot H.M./0000-0001-6097-4235; Gao, Xiaodong/0000-0002-4954-8830													0022-1694	1879-2707				MAR	2021	594								125977	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.125977	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.125977		JAN 2021											WOS:000641589600078

Rainwater use by cotton under subsurface drip and center pivot irrigation	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												To increase the efficiency by which agronomic crops use water from both irrigation and rain during the growing season requires quantifying the proportion of rainfall used by the crop for a rain event. The rainfall pattern in the Texas High Plains (THP) is characterized by isolated thunderstorms of high rates and of short duration, where < 1% of the storms produce rain events > 50 mm and 80% of total rain events are < than 13 mm. The primary source of irrigation-water in the THP is pumped from the Ogallala Aquifer (OA), which has a different isotopic (delta O-18) signature compared to rainfall-captured water. Given this difference, it is feasible to quantify changes in the delta O-18 signature of the plant water as the plant uptakes the rain- and irrigation-water stored in the soil. To this end, cotton (Gossypiurn hirsutum L.) was grown and irrigated with subsurface drip and center pivot and under dryland conditions. The irrigation-water was pumped from the OA and rainfall was collected in a rain gauge with mineral oil to prevent evaporation. Additionally, plant and soil samples were collected before and after each rain event. Thereafter, water was extracted from the collected soil and plant samples using cryogenic vacuum distillation and analyzed for delta O-18 (parts per thousand) using a Liquid-Water Isotope Analyzer. The difference in isotope concentrations in the extracts showed a change delta O-18 (parts per thousand) of the cotton petiole water toward that of the rainwater signature of 17% for sub-surface drip, 32% for dryland, and 63% for center pivot irrigation. These results imply that the application of irrigation-water with a sprinkler center pivot results in increased rainwater use in cotton compared to that of sub-surface drip.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				APR 20	2019	215						1	7		10.1016/j.agwat.2018.12.027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2018.12.027													WOS:000459950300001

The main objective was to determine (1) effect of seed priming with auxin (IAA), zinc (Zn) or manganese (Mn) on growth and yield parameters of wheat under dry land farming; (2) influence of on-farm priming withAzospirillumunder field conditions. In this study, the response of dryland wheat yield to soaking seeds in water, 2 ppm IAA, 0.2% Mn solution and 0.2% aqueous solution of Zn with or withoutAzospirillum zeaeinoculation was investigated under field condition. Total grain yield was significantly enhanced for water primed seeds i.e., 1273 kg ha(-1)(6.8%) or seeds primed with IAA, as compared to 1191 kg ha(-1)in plants from non-primed seeds. Difference in grain yield between priming with water and 2 ppm IAA was not significant when compared with 1372 kg ha(-1)(15%) for seeds primed with 0.2% Mn solution and 1440 kg ha(-1)(20%) for seeds primed with 0.2% Zn solution. Grain yield was significantly increased for plants inoculated withAzospirillum, 1411 kg ha(-1)(8%) as compared to 1191 t ha(-1)for non-Azospirillum-inoculated seeds. Yield parameters, i.e., tiller no. per m(-2), grain number per spike, and 1000-grain weight, were all significantly affected by priming treatments andAzospirilluminoculation. Grains with the high nitrogen and phosphorous content were recorded for the treatment where seeds were primed with Zn and inoculated withAzospirillum. In the present study, inoculation of wheat seeds followed by priming is a significant approach to enhance grain yield and grain nutrients (N and P) content.

These lateral flow paths create zones of saturation that promote nutrient loss from runoff and leaching beneath the root zone. Despite its clear importance, a spatially explicit representation of landscape hydrology is frequently missing from site-specific crop and fertilizer management plans. This work uses the grid-based water balance model, SMR (soil moisture routing), to adapt an established method of hydrologic classification, the Budyko framework, for small agricultural watersheds. The model was evaluated with spatially distributed soil moisture data and surface runoff measurements in four annually cropped fields located across the eastern Palouse region of the inland Pacific Northwest. The Budyko framework, modified to include change in root zone water storage and lateral flow, was combined with a separate indicator of yield potential to form a dual-threshold classification scheme for variable-rate fertilizer management that balances agronomic benefit with environmental impact. Each field was divided into zones based on crop yield and nitrogen loss potentials, which link to the hydrologic functioning of the landscape through soil water storage and subsurface redistribution, respectively. Results showed large variability in the annual water balance assessed within individual fields and between fields. The greatest variability was observed in the two eastern-most fields where the wettest zone of each had water supply 172% and 137% that of the dry zone. Depth to a hydraulic restrictive layer and topography were identified as primary landscape controls on the water supply (precipitation plus net lateral flow minus change in water storage) in these fields. Moreover, the steep climate gradient in the region created field-to-field variability in water balance with the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation ranging from 91% in the western-most field to approximately 70% in each of the fields to the east. The clearest choice is for growers to apply more fertilizer in areas with high water storage capacity and high crop yield and where fertilizer loss through leaching and runoff is minimal. Less fertilizer should be applied in areas with low water storage capacity that frequently saturate. Areas with high storage capacity and frequent saturation involve a tradeoff between yields and minimizing fertilizer loss that may be best served by splitting fertilizer application to avoid excessive over-winter leaching losses. Even though remote sensing and variable-rate applicators are at the frontiers of precision agriculture, landscape hydrology underlies all dryland crop production and should accordingly be looked to for inspiration in the design of cropping systems.

It is a necessity to improve the water use efficiency (WUE) of the crop once the water resource is limited. In northern China, where there is a wide shortage of water resources, it is therefore necessary to investigate how fertilization affects the WUE of spring maize and to quantify the effects. A total of 33 published peer-reviewed papers were collected, and a meta-analysis and random forest model analysis were performed with 364 WUE comparisons, aiming to explore the effects of fertilization on the WUE of spring maize and to clarify the optimal conditions for WUE under fertilizer management. The results showed that fertilization significantly increased the WUE of spring maize by 56.72% (P < 0.01) when compared with non-fertilization. The WUE effect under the organic-inorganic fertilizer combination (MNPK) was approximately twice as high as that under inorganic fertilizer (NPK) or organic fertilizer (M). The greatest increase in WUE occurred at 0-100 kg ha(-1) of nitrogen application (NA). Under environmental conditions including 7 <= mean annual temperature in the test year (T) <= 10 degrees C, 400 <= mean annual precipitation in the test year (P) <= 600 mm, and mean altitude (A) > 1500 m, and soil conditions including 10 <= soil organic matter content (SOM) <= 14 g kg(-1) and available phosphorus (AP) < 5 mg kg(-1), the fertilization optimally enhanced the WUE of spring maize when the agronomic measures of ridge-furrow planting (RFP) and mulching film (MF) were used. The random forest model analysis indicated that the influence factors (i.e., fertilizer regimes, environmental factors, soil factors, and agronomic measures) caused 65.62% of the variation in spring maize WUE effects, while in all influence factors, fertilizer types related to fertilizer regimes caused the most variation. The initial available potassium (AK) and available nitrogen (AN) of the soil were negatively correlated to the WUE effect, indicating that fertilization imposed a better effect on the WUE of spring maize when the soil was infertile. Fertilization significantly increased the WUE of spring maize, and organic and inorganic fertilizer application provided an effective measure for the sustainable development of spring maize in northern China. After clarifying the required conditions for fertilization increasing WUE, high-efficiency water use may be achieved.

J	Nelson, C; Giraldo-Silva, A; Garcia-Pichel, F				Nelson, Corey; Giraldo-Silva, Ana; Garcia-Pichel, Ferran			A Fog-Irrigated Soil Substrate System Unifies and Optimizes Cyanobacterial Biocrust Inoculum Production	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are globally important microbial communities inhabiting the top layer of soils. They provide multiple services to dryland ecosystems but are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic disturbance from which they naturally recover only slowly. Assisted inoculation with cyanobacteria is held as a promising approach to promote biocrust regeneration. Two different methodologies have been developed for this purpose: mass cultivation of biocrust pioneer species (such as the cyanobacteria Microcoleus spp.) on cellulose supports, and polymicrobial cultivation of biocrusts in soils within greenhouse settings. Here, we aimed to test a novel method to grow cyanobacterial biocrust inoculum based on fog irrigation of soil substrates (FISS) that can be used with either culture-based or mixed-community approaches. We found that the FISS system presents clear advantages over previous inoculum production methodologies; overall, FISS eliminates the need for specialized facilities and decreases user effort. Specifically, there were increased microbial yields and simplification of design compared to those of the culture-based and mixed-community approaches, respectively. Its testing also allows us to make recommendations on underexplored aspects of biocrust restoration: (i) field inoculation levels should be equal to or greater than the biomass found in the substrate and (ii) practices regarding evaluation of cyanobacterial biomass should, under certain circumstances, include proxies additional to chlorophyll a. IMPORTANCE Biocrust inoculum production for use in dryland rehabilitation is a powerful tool in combating the degradation of dryland ecosystems. However, the facilities and effort required to produce high-quality inoculum are often a barrier to effective large-scale implementation by land managers. By unifying and optimizing the two foremost methods for cyanobacterial biocrust inoculum production, our work improves on the ease and cost with which biocrust restoration technology can be translated to practical widespread implementation.

Productivity, economic performance, and soil quality of conventional, mixed, and organic dryland farming systems in eastern Washington State	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												The global trends of shortening crop rotations, simplifying cropping systems, and segregating livestock from cropping enterprises have generated high yields while creating high environmental costs. Diversification, including integrated crop/livestock systems and the use of cover, forage, and perennial crops, can be used to improve soil health, reduce financial risk, increase yields, and reduce many negative environmental externalities. With such diversification in mind, we conducted a 5-year study examining four contrasting farming systems in dryland eastern Washington State in terms of their impacts on total productivity, economic performance, and soil quality. The four systems were a conventional (CONV) winter wheat/spring wheat/spring pea rotation, typical for the area; a mixed crop-livestock (MIX) winter wheat/spring wheat/grazed winter pea forage rotation; an organic mixed crop-livestock (ORGcrop) rotation of 3 yr perennial alfalfa and grass/grazed pea forage/winter wheat; and an organic hay (ORGhay) continuous perennial alfalfa and grass system. Soft white winter wheat (SWWW) yields were higher following grazed pea forage in MIX (6.2 Mg ha(-1)) than following harvested pea crop in CONV (5.9 Mg ha(-1)) despite lower N fertilizer rates in MIX. Following 3 yr of alfalfa and grass hay and no N fertilizer, SWWW yields in ORGcrop (6.2 Mg ha(-1)) were similar to CONV and MIX yields but averaged 15.5% lower protein concentration. Over the 5-yr rotation, average net returns were ORGhay ($616 yr(-1))> ORGcrop (216 yr(-1))> MIX (-1 yr(-1)) = CONV (-13 yr(-1)), in part due to high hay prices and average grain prices during this period compared to long-term averages. Over the course of the study, total soil profile SOC showed significant negative trends in CONV (-3.1 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) and MIX (-4.1 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) but not in ORGcrop and ORGhay. In surface (0-15 cm) soil, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen and beta-glucosidase activity were greater in ORGcrop and ORGhay than in CONV and MIX. The landscape position of this study site is of relatively poorer soil quality and results may differ across the heterogeneity of a whole farm field. Overall, ORGhay, ORGcrop, MIX, and CONV in this order produced a gradation of forage production relative to cereal production from greatest to least, and also a gradation of economic and soil sustainability metrics from greatest to least. This study found that integrating perennial crops, such as alfalfa and forage grasses, into organic farming systems can build soil quality, be profitable, and supply nitrogen to succeeding grain crops.

A five-season (June 2013-October 2015) field experiment was conducted using N fertilizer rates of 0, 86, 172 and 258 kg ha(-1)during the summer maize growing season, and 0, 105, 210 and 315 kg ha(-1)during the winter wheat growing season. Soil NR increased sharply as N rates rose, but soil moisture storage decreased. Summer maize under the high N treatment suffered from increased NR levels and low soil water at the vegetative stage. The dry matter levels increased as the N supply rose during the wheat season. When the N application rate was below 210 and 172 kg N ha(-1)for wheat and maize, respectively, yield increased as the N application rose, but excessive N applications negatively affected maize and wheat grain yields. NUE decreased significantly as time progressed and N rates increased. The most appropriate N rates were 172 kg N ha(-1)for maize and 210 kg N ha(-1)for wheat, which led to relatively good soil moisture uptake and NR conditions.

Climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies in drylands of Northern Karnataka	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES												This study was carried out in Vijayapura and Bagalkot districts of Karnataka to assess the adoption of improved technologies by dryland farmers to mitigate effects of climate change. Primary' data was collected from 240 farmers using multi-stage random sampling technique. Nearly 70% farmers experienced the decreased and uneven distribution of rainfall, 35% farmers experienced untimely rainfall and 48% farmers experienced increase in temperature. This unpredictable variation in climate especially rainfall and temperature resulted in decreased crop yields, frequent crop failures, sinking water level in bore wells and open wells and increased emergence of pest and diseases. The farmers in the region sustained crop yields by adopting climate resilience indigenous and modern scientific technologies like manipulating sowing dates, mixed fanning, crop diversification, alternate cropping systems and drought tolerant varieties.The age of farmer, access to irrigation, level of education, fanning experience, social participation, land holding size, livestock possession and institutional credit had significant impact on adoption of climate resilient technologies by the farmers in the region.																			0019-5022	2394-3319				JAN	2022	92	1					80	84		10.56093/ijas.v92i1.120844	http://dx.doi.org/10.56093/ijas.v92i1.120844													WOS:000897368400017

Productivity and soil quality of organic forage, quinoa, and grain cropping systems in the dryland Pacific Northwest, USA	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Organic management is rapidly expanding as an alternative to conventional agriculture, but maintaining sufficient available soil nitrogen (N) supply is a challenge for organic systems in the semiarid regions of the US Pacific Northwest (PNW). Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) is a potential new crop for such systems, but there are many knowledge gaps regarding impacts of quinoa in crop rotations in the US. Here we tested the effects of quinoa in organic crop rotations for the Palouse region of the PNW. Specifically, we evaluated eight 3-year grain crop sequences, as part of a longer rotation with alfalfa, on the following metrics: crop productivity, soil N budgets, soil microbial parameters, arbuscular mycorrhizae, and soil aggregate size distribution. Organic crop yields averaged 495, 2736, and 2403 kg ha(-1) for chickpea, barley, and wheat, respectively (33 %, 79 % and 77 % of the respective crop county averages). Yields were affected by weather across growing seasons, as were the amount and quality of residues, which in turn influenced soil N cycling. Overall soil N supply decreased slightly through the 3-yr sequences. Cereal grain yields were correlated with inorganic N (IN), and the correlation was stronger for subsurface (30 -150 cm) depths than the surface (0 - 30 cm); IN was sufficient to support high cereal yields even in the later years when weather was suitable, but cereal yields overall may have been N-limited. Crop yields were more highly correlated with spring surface soil potentially mineralizable N than with spring surface IN. More inorganic N was available in surface (0 - 30 cm) post-harvest soil following quinoa (13.1 kg N ha(-1) more) compared to wheat, but quinoa yields were low, with a 4-yr average of 104 kg ha(-1). Soil microbial biomass and activity were not affected by sequence treatments. Although plants of the family Amaranthaceae are often considered "non-mycorrhizal", moderate rates of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonization were observed in quinoa. However, AMF colonization was lower in quinoa compared to other grains in the sequences, and the colonization of crops following quinoa was lower than following wheat. Soil structure was finer after quinoa, with a higher proportion of aggregates in the smaller size classes. Our results show that quinoa affects soil properties, and that organic management of 3-yr dryland grain sequences in rotation with alfalfa are possible in this area, given efficient N cycling through crop residues.

Methods The treatments comprised sole maize, sole peanut, maize-peanut intercropping, maize-peanut intercropping-rotation (rotation of the maize and peanut planting strips every year), and maize-peanut intercropping-rotation with 20% and 40% N reduction in maize planting strip. Soil water and total N stock, photosynthetic traits, yield, greenhouse gas emissions, economic income, and interspecific relationships were evaluated. Results Intercropped maize absorbed more moisture but lost more N than sole maize. Maize-peanut intercropping had higher economic benefits and less N2O emissions than sole maize, but had no intercropped advantage on land equivalent ratio. In addition, intercropping increased the continuous cropping barriers of peanuts than a sole peanut. Rotation of the planting strips in intercropping increased the peanut yield and economic benefits compared with not rotating the planting strips, and the economic benefits reached the highest level in the third planting year. A 20% N reduction in maize planting strips can decrease the global warming potential without affecting economic benefits. A 40% N reduction in maize planting strips could reduce soil N stock, maize yield, water use efficiency, N use efficiency, land equivalent ratio, and income. Conclusions A maize-peanut intercropping-rotation system is recommended for dryland farming since it promoted efficient use of N and economic benefits and decreased N2O emission. The proper N reduction in maize planting does not lead to N stress but decreased global warming potential.

Effects of vegetation on bacterial communities, carbon and nitrogen in dryland soil surfaces: implications for shrub encroachment in the southwest Kalahari	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Shrub encroachment is occurring in many of the world's drylands, but its impacts on ecosystem structure and function are still poorly understood. In particular, it remains unclear how shrub encroachment affects dryland soil surfaces, including biological soil crust (biocrust) communities. In this study, soil surfaces (0-1 cm depth) were sampled from areas of Grewia flava shrubs and Eragrostis lehmanniana and Schmidtia kalahariensis grasses in the southwest Kalahari during two different seasons (March and November). Our hypothesis is that the presence of different vegetation cover types (shrubs versus grasses) alters the microbial composition of soil surfaces owing to their contrasting microenvironments. The results showed that more significant differences in microclimate (light, soil surface temperatures) and soil surface microbial communities were observed between shrubs and grasses than between sampling seasons. Based on high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing, our findings showed that approximately one third (33.5%) of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) occurred exclusively in soil surfaces beneath shrubs. Soil surfaces with biocrusts in grass areas were dominated by the cyanobacteria Microcoleus steenstrupii, whereas the soil surfaces beneath shrubs were dominated by the proteobacteria Microvirga flocculans. Soil surfaces beneath shrubs are associated with reduced cyanobacterial abundance but have higher total carbon and total nitrogen contents compared to biocrusts in grass areas. These findings infer changes in the relative contributions from different sources of carbon and nitrogen (e.g. cyanobacterial and non-cyanobacterial fixation, plant litter, animal activity). The distinctive microbial composition and higher carbon and nitrogen contents in soil surfaces beneath shrubs may provide a positive feedback mechanism promoting shrub encroachment, which helps to explain why the phenomenon is commonly observed to be irreversible.

In drylands, low annual rainfall and resultant poor ground cover, coupled with high-intensity storms and dispersive soils, predispose these landscapes to gully erosion. Land management, such as grazing, exacerbates gully-forming processes by degrading ground cover and compacting soils, thereby increasing and concentrating overland flow. Current surface erosion models do not adequately represent sediment export from gullied terrain due to lack of distributed data and complex hydrogeomorphic processes, such as overland flow concentration, waterfall erosion, soil pipe collapse, and mass wasting. Here, we outline the strengths and weaknesses of past modelling approaches in erodible terrain and focus on how gully erosion processes can be better simulated at appropriate scales using newly available remote-sensing techniques and databases, coupled with improved understanding of relevant hydrogeomorphic processes. We also discuss and present examples of challenges related to assessing land management practices in drylands that affect gully erosion.

This study was conducted to determine the physiological and biochemical response of Bakhtiari savory (Satureja bachtiarica Bunge.) to cattle manure (30-ton ha(-1)) and plant density (high plant density, HPD: 80000, medium plant density, MPD: 40000, and low plant density, LPD: 26666 plant ha(-1)) during 2018 and 2019. Chlorophyll (Chl) content, relative water content (RWC), Malondialdehyde (MAD), proline concentrations, total phenol content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and essential oil (EO) percentage of Bakhtiari savory were measured under dryland farming condition. Chl a and b increased under manure application at high/MPD in the second year. RWC at high/MPD with manure application in the second-year plants was higher compared to other experimental treatments. The highest MAD was observed in plants at LPD with non-manure application in the first year. Increased proline concentration was found at LPD compared to MPD and HPD. TPC and TFC in second-year plants were significantly greater than the first-year plants. Organic fertilizer improved TPC and TFC content. The greatest TPC and TFC were observed at MPD with manure application in the second-year plants. EO percentage in MPD was higher than other plant densities. The highest EO percentage was achieved at MPD with manure application in the second-year plants. It could be suggested that use of cattle manure and HPD or MPD leads to obtain higher plant production.

Compost and soil moisture effects on seasonal carbon and nitrogen dynamics, greenhouse gas fluxes and global warming potential of semi-arid soils	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RECYCLING OF ORGANIC WASTE IN AGRICULTURE												Purpose An 8-week incubation study was conducted to monitor soil inorganic nitrogen (N), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), greenhouse gases (GHG) [CO2, N2O and CH4] and cumulative global warming potential (GWP) in dryland soil. Methods Soil was amended with variable rates of compost (zero, 15, 30 and 45 dry Mg ha(-1)) and soil moistures [5% (dry), 7% (normal) and 14% (wet) water filled pore space (WFPS)] and experienced biweekly temperature transitions from 5 degrees C (late winter) to 10 degrees C (early spring) to 15 degrees C (late spring) to 25 degrees C (early summer). Results The addition of 30 and 45 Mg ha(-1) compost enhanced N mineralization with 13% more soil inorganic N (7.49 and 7.72 mu g Ng(-1) day(-1), respectively) during early summer compared with lower compost rates. Normal and wet soils had 35% more DOC in the late spring (an average of 34 mu g g(-1) day(-1)) compared to the dry WFPS, but transitioning from late spring to early summer, DOC at all soil WFPS levels increased. Highest rates of compost were not significant sources of GHG with normal soil WFPS, compared with lower compost rates. Carbon dioxide emissions increased by 59 and 15%, respectively, as soil WFPS increased from dry to normal and normal to wet. Soils with normal WFPS were the most effective CH4 sink. Conclusion One-time application of high compost rates to dryland soils leads to enhanced N and C mineralization under normal soil moisture and warmer temperature of the summer but will not pose significant global warming dangers to the environment through GHG emissions since soils are rarely wet.

J	Yigezu, YA; El-Shater, T				Yigezu, Yigezu A.; El-Shater, Tamer			Socio-economic impacts of zero and reduced tillage in wheat fields of the Moroccan drylands	AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS												Zero tillage (ZT) is recommended for dryland farming because it enhances retention of residual soil moisture. However, it is not always clear whether this translates to an economic advantage over conventional tillage, which helps in controlling weeds. Using a nationally representative sample of 1901 wheat fields in Morocco as a case study, we provide comparative analysis on different tillage intensities. Results from an endogenous switching regression model showed that fields that were not tilled gave 298.6 kg/ha (23%) higher yields, US$89/ha (27%) more income and more stable yields than those tilled once or more. Fields that were not tilled also had 87% lower yield variance with 100% and 65.6% less risk of giving yield levels below 500 and 1000 kg/ha, respectively. The highest yield losses occurred during the first and third tillage passes, but the second had negligible effect. Labor saving from avoiding tillage under ZT was undermined by higher labor needed for weeding. Along with biophysical benefits documented elsewhere, our results show that, if constraints for its wider diffusion are removed, zero or reduced tillage has the potential to sustainably improve the economic and biophysical viability of dryland agriculture in Morocco and other similar countries in North Africa and West Asia.																			0169-5150	1574-0862				JUL	2021	52	4					645	663		10.1111/agec.12640	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/agec.12640		JUN 2021											WOS:000656997500001

WL1 (Eustigmatophyceae) isolated from dryland biological soil crusts in China	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY												A new strain of Eustigmatophyceae, Vischeria sp. WL1, which accumulates oil droplets in the cells, was isolated from a large biological soil crust in the arid steppes of north-western China. Its growth and oil productivity were explored using nitrate-N and peptone-N sources, as well as salt stress treatment. Compared to the commonly used similar to 18.0 mM nitrate-N, 4.5 mM nitrate-N was found to be relatively cost-effective for oil production, and 4.5 mM peptone-N was much more effective. After 24 days of cultivation, the biomass increased up to 7.5 times the initial biomass and the oil yield reached 1.13 g L-1 for the 4.5 mM peptone-N condition. In addition, supplementation of 0.3 M NaCl in the medium was found to enhance the oil productivity, while 3.0 M NaCl treatment facilitated the obtaining of relatively pure oil, removing more than 95% of the cellular pigments prior to oil extraction. The oils produced are characterized by high contents of C16:1 (similar to 50%) and C20:5 (similar to 10%) fatty acids, implying that they may serve as ideal biodiesel feedstocks or nutritional supplements. In general, this study reported a new dryland microalgal strain and its biotechnological potential in the production of oils with biofuel or edible value.

Various global soil moisture products have been mostly retrieved from microwave remote sensing data. However, currently there is rarely spatially explicit and time-continuous soil moisture information with a high resolution at the national scale. In this study, we generated a 1 km soil moisture dataset for dryland wheat and maize in China (ChinaCropSM1 km) over 1993-2018 through a random forest (RF) algorithm based on numerous in situ daily observations of soil moisture. We independently used in situ observations (181 327 samples) from the agricultural meteorological stations (AMSs) across China for training (164 202 samples) and others for testing (17 125 samples). An irrigation module was first developed according to crop type (i.e., wheat, maize), soil depth (0-10, 10-20 cm) and phenology. We produced four daily datasets separately by crop type and soil depth, and their accuracies were all satisfactory (wheat r 0.93, ubRMSE 0.033 m(3) m(-3); maize r 0.93, ubRMSE 0.035 m(3) m(-3)). The spatiotemporal resolutions and accuracy of ChinaCropSM1 km were significantly better than those of global soil moisture products (e.g., r increased by 116 %, ubRMSE decreased by 64 %), including the global remote-sensing-based surface soil moisture dataset (RSSSM) and the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) SM. The approach developed in our study could be applied to other regions and crops in the world, and our improved datasets are very valuable for many studies and field management, such as agricultural drought monitoring and crop yield forecasting.

Foliar fertilization of two dominant species in a semiarid ecosystem improves their ecophysiological status and the use efficiency of a water pulse	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												The role of soil fertility in modulating plant water utilization from rainfall pulses under dryland conditions is poorly understood. Moreover, the effectiveness of soil fertilization in drylands is difficult to ensure due to immobilization of nutrients such as phosphorus and micronutrients. The use of foliar fertilization could overcome these difficulties, but its effectiveness has not been evaluated in wild dryland plants so far. In this study, we assessed the responses to foliar P, Fe, Mn and Zn fertilization before a rainfall event in two Mediterranean species with contrasting strategies to cope with drought/light stress, namely, Stipa tenacissima (poikilochlorophyllous) and Rosmarinus officinalis (photoprotective). We hypothesized that foliar fertilization can mitigate soil nutritional constraints and trigger physiological improvements enabling a more efficient use of water pulses. In nonfertilized plants, the rainfall event triggered increases in chlorophyll content, epoxidation of xanthophyll cycle pigments and PSII efficiency, indicating stress alleviation and photosynthesis improvement, but also induced decreases in foliar concentrations of several elements. Foliar fertilization increased the concentrations of sprayed nutrients in the leaves of both species. In R. officinalis, P and Zn fertilization also increased carotenoid concentrations, PSII photochemical efficiency and photosynthesis rates, and changed delta O-18 isotope ratios. While in S. tenacissima, Fe and Mn fertilization increased photosynthetic pigment concentrations without affecting PSII efficiency. The results obtained show that foliar fertilization can mitigate soil nutritional constraints affecting dryland vegetation, thereby promoting species-specific physiological responses to cope with water and/or light stress and ultimately leading to a more efficient use of rainfall pulses.

Plant water-use strategies predict restoration success across degraded drylands	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Plant strategies for coping with water limitation are likely to mediate restoration outcomes in degraded dryland ecosystems. Trade-offs in traits related to water acquisition and use can intensify in more arid environments, making their effects on dryland restoration success even more salient. However, isolating the effects of drought responses from those of other environmental factors, as well as identifying the specific drought resistance traits that influence restoration success, can be difficult.2. In the present study, we couple a controlled dry-down experiment with a cross-site restoration field trial of out-planted seedlings (RestoreNet) using a suite of dryland herbaceous plant species from the same seed sources. We quantified interspecific variation in physiological responses to drought, specifically reductions in stomatal conductance (g(s)) and stem water potential (SWP), by comparing well-watered control plants to those experiencing decreasing soil moisture.3. Drought responses of SWP and g(s) varied independently among species, but both were related to survival in the cross-site restoration field trial when effect sizes were aggregated across all sites. Responses were consistent with acquisitive water-use strategies resulting in greater success, where species with greater declines in SWP or weaker declines in g(s) under drought had greater survival. The correlation between SWP drought response and survival also intensified in sites with lower accumulated precipitation following restoration.4. Differences among functional groups revealed two different paths to restoration success: forbs that maintain high g(s) and narrow safety margins to maximize exploitation of moisture pulses before going into drought dormancy, or C-4 grasses that maintain efficient water uptake in drying soils while risking cavitation. C-3 grass species varied between these two strategies.5. Synthesis and applications. Taken together, the results of this study and others conducted at RestoreNet sites indicate that while a diversity of physiological responses to drought may exist in dryland plant communities, successfully restoring herbaceous species through out-planting in degraded conditions is likely to be achieved with species that maximize water uptake via one of two strategies, with tolerance of low SWP being particularly important in the most arid settings.

However, maps of their distribution over large spatial scales are uncommon and sometimes unreliable, because our current remote sensing technology is unable to efficiently discriminate between biocrusts and vascular plants or even bare soil across different ecosystem and soil types. The lack of biocrust spatial data may limit our ability to detect risks to dryland function or key tipping points. Here, we indirectly mapped biocrust distribution in China's drylands using spatial prediction modeling, based on a set of occurrences of biocrusts (379 in total) and high-resolution soil and environmental data. The results showed that biocrusts currently cover 13.9 % of China's drylands (or 5.7 % of China's total area), with moss-, lichen-, and cyanobacterial-dominated biocrusts each occupying 5.7 % to 10.7 % of the region. Biocrust distribution is mainly determined by soil properties (soil type and contents of gravel and nitrogen), aridity stress, and altitude. Their most favorable habitat is arenosols with low contents of gravel and nitrogen, in climate with a drought index of 0.54 and an altitude of about 500 m. By 2050, climate change will lead to a 5.5 %-9.0 % reduction in biocrust cover. Lichen biocrusts exhibit a high vulnerability to climate change, with potential reductions of up to 19.0 % in coverage. Biocrust cover loss is primarily caused by the combined effects of the elevated temperature and increased precipitation. Our study provides the first high-resolution (250 x 250 m) map of biocrust distribution in China's drylands and offers a reliable approach for mapping regional or global biocrust colonization. We suggest incorporating biocrusts into Earth system models to identify their significant impact on global or regional-scale processes under climate change.

In this study, we investigated 804 farmers' wheat fields from 2015 to 2018 in the dryland area of the Loess Plateau in China and analyzed the relationships between wheat yield and the influence factors (including precipitation, wheat sowing rate, fertilizer inputs, and soil nutrients) to propose optimized agricultural management practices for wheat production. The results showed that wheat grain yield followed a linear plateau pattern relative to the precipitation in the summer fallow season, with a yield of 5344 kg ha(-1) obtained at a precipitation of 203 mm. In the L203 group (precipitation in the summer fallow season less than 203 mm), the Low-yield subgroup (0-33th in grain yield group (in order from low to high)) had a lower sowing rate, kernel weight, kernel number and spike number than the High-yield subgroup (68-100th in grain yield group); different levels of phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) fertilizer overuse were found among the three yield subgroups. However, in the H203 group (precipitation in the summer fallow season greater than 203 mm), differences in only kernel and spike numbers and nitrogen (N) fertilizer application rate were observed among the Low-, Moderate-, and High-yield subgroups. Additionally, there were no differences in the soil organic matter (SOM), total N or pH in the three subgroups in either L203 or H203, but significant differences in soil mineral N, available P and K were observed among the three subgroups (except mineral N in L203). Based on these results, the wheat sowing rate and fertilizer input rates can be optimized to increase wheat yield and farmers' income and promote agricultural management for dryland wheat production on the Loess Plateau.

In this study, 13 winter bread wheat genotypes (old, relatively old, modern, and breeding lines) were evaluated under three different tillage systems, i.e., conventional tillage (CT, full tillage with residue removed), reduced tillage (RT, chisel tillage with residue retained) and no-tillage (NT, no-tillage with residue retained on the soil surface) in farmer's fields under rainfed conditions using strip-plot arrangements in a randomized complete block design with three replications in the west of Iran (Kamyaran and Hosseinabad locations) over two cropping seasons (2018-2019 and 2019-2020). The main objectives were to investigate the effects of tillage systems and growing conditions on the agronomic characteristics, grain yield and stability performance of rainfed winter bread wheat genotypes. Significant (P<0.01) genotypextillage system interaction effects on grain yield and agronomic traits suggested that the genotypes responded differently to the different tillage systems. The number of grains per spike and plant height were positively (P<0.0) associated with grain yield under the NT system, so they may be considered as targeted traits for future wheat breeding. Using statistical models, the modern cultivars ("Sadra" and "Baran") were identified as high yielding and showed yield stability across the different tillage systems. As per each tillage system, genotype "Sadra" followed by "Zargana-6//Dari 1-7 Sabalan" exhibited higher adaption to CT; while cultivars "Jam" and "Azar2" showed better performance under the RT system; and cultivars "Varan" and "Baran" tended to have better performance expression in the NT condition. The increased grain yields achieved in combination with lower costs and greater profits from conservation agriculture suggest that adapted cultivar and NT systems should be evaluated and promoted more widely to farmers in the west of Iran as an attractive package of crop management technologies. In conclusion, variations in the performance of genotypes and the significant genotypextillage system interaction effects on grain yield and some agronomic traits assessed in this study suggest that the development and selection of cultivars adapted to the NT system should be considered and included in the strategies and objectives of winter wheat breeding programs for the temperate and cold dryland conditions of Iran.

This disequilibrium between climate and community composition could diminish, however, when critical climate thresholds are exceeded, due to population declines or losses among the more mismatched species. Here, we assessed the effect of an extreme drought event on rich semiarid shrubland communities in the south-eastern Iberian Peninsula. Using a community climate framework, we compared the community climatic disequilibrium before and after the drought episode on three study sites with different levels of precipitation. Disequilibrium was estimated as the difference between observed reference climate and community-inferred climate, calculated as the mean climatic optimum for the species present, weighted by their abundances. We found that extreme drought embedded within a decadal trend of increasing aridity led to a significant reduction in community climatic disequilibrium, and that this reduction was positively related to water deficit (low P/PET values). In contrast, microhabitat variables such as vegetation cover or slope, did not emerge as significant predictors of changes in community climatic disequilibrium. Our study highlights that extreme drought events pushing communities in the same direction as climate trends may decrease community climatic mismatch, leading to communities more adapted to aridity through loss of drought-sensitive species. These findings underscore that extreme events will play a crucial role in speeding up climate-induced community transformations and biodiversity losses.

Scale-wide participatory evaluation and promotion of improved teff technologies was thus conducted to assess their profitability, farmer preferences and constraints in Northeast Amhara drylands. Zoble and Kuncho improved teff technologies were compared with the local teff production practice for three consecutive years on un-replicated farms using 270 farmers. All necessary data were collected and analyzed in descriptive statistics, cost-benefit ratio, weighted matrix and poisson regression model. Therefore, Zoble teff provided 1620 and 1280 kgha(-1) average yield in Sekota and Lasta districts, respectively. Kuncho teff provided average yield of 1830 and 1420 kgha(-1) in Lasta and Sekota districts. They also ensured 3.7 and 4.5 ETB return for 1 ETB investment on production costs in Sekota and Lasta districts, orderly. Moreover, Zoble and Kuncho teff were primary and secondary choices of farmers in Sekota, and vice-versa in Lasta. The regression result revealed that except land holding size of the household head, other significant factors (sex, family size, training and credit access) were positively influenced teff technology package application. Hence, Zoble and Kuncho teff technologies should further diffuse to Sekota and Lasta districts, respectively. Providing access to package components, eminence training and credit services is worthwhile to enhance farmers' technology package application. Agricultural mechanization research also should take an initiative to design labor relaxing devices to ease the labor pressure imposed by large farm size.					mihiretu, ademe/AHD-3473-2022	mihiretu, ademe/0000-0002-2861-5694													2331-1932					APR 14	2020	6	1							1746228	10.1080/23311932.2020.1746228	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2020.1746228													WOS:000528800600001

In this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to study the influences of three N fertilizer levels (0 (N0), 90 (N90) and 120 (N120) kg ha-1) and two biochar levels (0 (B0) and 20 (B20) t ha-1) on the soil microbial community and symbiotic network among microbial taxa in wheat fields. Compared to the control (B0N0), N fertilizer alone or combined with biochar significantly increased soil total N, available N, and organic matter in topsoil (0-20 cm), and the same results were found only in B20N120 treatment in subsoil (20-40 cm). In addition, bacterial and fungal diversity in topsoil were significantly increased and decreased by all N and biochar treatments, respectively. Moreover, soil bacterial and fungal community compositions also were also changed by N and biochar. Furthermore, biochar weakened the competition and cooperation among microorganisms in topsoil and subsoil, and the keystone species of networks were also changed by biochar. Redundancy analysis showed that soil total N, available N, available P, available K and pH were the main environmental factors driving the changes in bacterial and fungal community structures. These data indicated that the addition of N fertilizer and biochar could improve soil fertility by maintaining the stability of microbial community structures, which can provide reasonable guidance for the sustainable development of agriculture, such as maintaining dryland production.																			0045-6535	1879-1298				JAN	2023	312		1						137101	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.137101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.137101		NOV 2022						36334753					WOS:000903951300006

Dynamics of Fenugreek Production: An Elixir for Dryland Agriculture	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND DEVELOPMENT												This study estimated the growth in the area, forecast of seed demand and economics of the fenugreek enterprise by using primary and secondary data. The results indicated that India had registered a growth of 5.26 per cent per annum in the fenugreek area. In contrast, Karnataka has shown a declining trend of 7.56 per cent per annum in the fenugreek area. Following this trend, the incremental and total estimated area in India would be 6.87 and 137.31 thousand ha, respectively, which demands fenugreek seed to the tune of 3433 MT during 2022-23. An estimated Cost C for fenugreek production was.95,434 per ha. In comparison, the gross 3 and net income were to the tune of.1,80,137 and 84,703 per ha, respectively, with a benefit-cost ratio of 1.89. The lack of availability of high-yielding varieties and the high wage rate were significant constraints in fenugreek cultivation.																			2277-5412	2322-0430				DEC	2022	18	4					929	935		10.35716/IJED/22198	http://dx.doi.org/10.35716/IJED/22198													WOS:000924607400019

A Random Forest-Based Multi-Index Classification (RaFMIC) Approach to Mapping Three-Decadal Inundation Dynamics in Dryland Wetlands Using Google Earth Engine	REMOTE SENSING												Australian inland riparian wetlands located east of the Great Dividing Range exhibit unique, hydroecological characteristics. These flood-dependent aquatic systems located in water-limited regions are declining rapidly due to the competitive demand for water for human activities, as well as climate change and variability. However, there exist very few reliable data to characterize inundation change conditions and quantify the impacts of the loss and deterioration of wetlands. A long-term time record of wetland inundation maps can provide a crucial baseline to monitor, assess, and assist the management and conservation of wetland ecosystems. This study presents a random forest-based multi-index classification algorithm (RaFMIC) on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to efficiently construct a temporally dense, three-decadal time record of inundation maps of the southeast Australian riparian inland wetlands. The method was tested over the Macquarie Marshes located in the semiarid region of NSW, Australia. The results showed a good accuracy when compared against high-spatial resolution imagery. The total inundated area was consistent with precipitation and streamflow patterns, and the temporal dynamics of vegetation showed good agreement with the inundation maps. The inundation time record was analysed to generate inundation probability maps, which were in a good agreement with frequently flooded areas simulated by a hydrodynamic model and the distribution of flood-dependent vegetation species. The long-term, time-dense inundation maps derived from the RaFMIC method can provide key information to assess the condition and health of wetland ecosystems and have the potential to improve wetland inventory with spatially explicit water regime information. RaFMIC can be adapted over other dryland wetlands, as an effective semiautomated method of mapping long-term inundation dynamics.					; Senanayake, Indishe/C-1768-2019	Yeo, In-Young/0000-0001-5991-733X; Senanayake, Indishe/0000-0003-0507-8176														2072-4292				MAR	2023	15	5							1263	10.3390/rs15051263	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15051263													WOS:000947659300001

However, as a universal statement, this may not be true as best documented successful agroforestry practices are located largely on good soils. Its impacts on dryland soils have rarely been quantified and studied in detail. This study determined the impacts of selected agroforestry practices on soil properties in Makueni, Eastern Kenya. A total of 252 soil samples were collected along transects located within mixed tree woodlots established in 2007, 2010 and 2013 and adjacent parklands and grazing lands at depths of 0-15 cm, 15-30 cm, 30-45 cm and 45-60 cm. Tree density per agroforestry practice was also determined using the quadrat technique. The soil samples were analyzed using laboratory soil physico-chemical properties techniques. The results showed that Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) and Total Nitrogen (TN) were significantly higher in the woodlots than in the parkland and grazing lands (p <= 0.05). SOC was significantly higher in woodlots established in 2007 than those established in 2013 and strongly correlated with the tree density. Phosphorus was significantly higher in parkland as compared to woodlots and grazing lands. Phosphorus and Potassium were significantly higher at 0-15 cm depth compared to other soil depths. bulky density was significantly higher with a corresponding lower total porosity in grazing lands than in the woodlots and parklands. Mixed woodlots positively influenced soil property and could be considered as a strategy to restore degraded dryland soils as well act as important carbon dioxide and nitrogen sinks.																				2666-7193				DEC	2023	14								100437	10.1016/j.tfp.2023.100437	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tfp.2023.100437		SEP 2023											WOS:001084344100001

In this work, the improved Vegetation Interface Processes (VIP) model was employed to characterize the spatio-temporal pattern of the root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) from 1982 to 2015 over the West Liao River Basin (WLRB). Results showed that RZSM decreased in most parts of the WLRB along with precipitation decline and vegetation greening. Sensitivities of RZSM to climate and vegetation dynamics exhibited obvious spatial and seasonal heterogeneity. Averaged over the whole basin, sensitivity of RZSM to precipitation (S-P) is the highest. Significant seasonal differences were found in the sensitivity of RZSM to leaf area index (LAI) (S-LAI). S-LAI values in spring and autumn were generally negative throughout the WLRB, but prominent positive S-LAI values were observed in the north-west forest in summer, owing to the increased drier-and-browner associations in summer induced by the earlier spring greenness. Attribution analysis showed that relative contributions of precipitation, air temperature and LAI changes to the growing-season RZSM (RZSM(GS)) drying trend were 69.0%, 17.5% and 13.5 %, respectively. It can be inferred that precipitation decrease dominated the soil drying over the WLRB, while air warming and vegetation greening accelerated this drying. In a future warming scenario without substantial increase in water use efficiency (WUE), dryland ecosystems might suffer more severe biomass losses caused by complex soil-vegetation-atmosphere interactions. This study can improve our understanding of the terrestrial-atmospheric feedbacks and their possible effects on dryland ecosystems.

RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Active restoration is frequently implemented to restore degraded drylands globally, yet predicting the overall success of these restoration projects remains challenging. Here, we aim to explore if vegetation spatial patterns can be used to monitor ecosystem recovery and anticipate the success of restoration practices. We combined field surveys and high-resolution drone images to analyze how vegetation spatial patterns change after the large-scale straw checkerboards restoration projects in the sand dune systems of the Tengger Desert in northern China. We found that vegetation cover, plant species richness, and diversity increased rapidly, approaching the level of the naturally vegetated sand dunes, after 5 years of restoration. Soil fertility remained low despite the positive vegetation change. Along with the recovery process, we found a larger diversity of patch sizes (i.e. spatial variance) with an increasing proportion of large-size patches. These patterns, combined with a constant positive recovery rate in vegetation cover, are consistent with theoretical predictions used to anticipate transitions to alternative ecosystem states. Although some indicators may be masked by the artificial planting scheme and community succession process during recovery, our results show that vegetation spatial patterns can be used to forecast and monitor the possible recovery of drylands.

Three agroecosystems (AE) were selected from the Department of 25 de Mayo, San Juan. Its main economic activity is goat farming and, to a lesser extent, cultivation of orchards, as well as subsistence economic activities. To determine the state of sustainability, the indicators were selected and subsequently standardized and weighted according to their relative importance with respect to sustainability. The results indicated that none of the dryland AE achieves sustainability simultaneously in its three dimensions. The systemic analysis through indicators showed that the critical variables are food self-sufficiency, water access, livestock survival, and technical assistance, among others. The methodology used is simple, allowing to detect the sustainability status of the three EAs, and to identify the critical variables that jeopardize the permanence of the AE over time.																				1853-8665				JUN	2020	52	1					190	209																WOS:000545872300015

Despite progress in understanding the ecology of viruses in extreme environments, viruses' dynamics and functional roles in dryland ecosystems, which cover about 45% of the Earth's land surfaces, remain largely unexplored. This study characterizes virus sequences in the metagenomes of endolithic (within rock) microbial communities ubiquitously found in hyper-arid deserts. Taxonomic classification and network construction revealed the presence of novel and diverse viruses in communities inhabiting calcite, gypsum, and ignimbrite rocks. Viral genome maps show a high level of protein diversity within and across endolithic communities and the presence of virus-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes. Phage-host relationships were predicted by matching tRNA, CRISPR spacer, and protein sequences in the viral and microbial metagenomes. Primary producers and heterotrophic bacteria were found to be putative hosts to some viruses. Intriguingly, viral diversity was not correlated with microbial diversity across rock substrates.

However, changes in production efficiency and the environmental footprint remain less investigated when narrowing these gaps. In this study, we collected data from 299 wheat plots on the Loess Plateau of China to identify changes in nitrogen efficiency, nutrient balance, and environmental risks when narrowing the yield gaps. The low-yielding (L-gamma) and high-yielding (H-gamma) plots had an average yield gap of 1936 kg ha(-1) (33.5%) and nitrogen partial factor productivity gap of 10.3 kg kg(-1) (30.1%) that were simultaneously narrowed under similar fertilizer inputs. Optimizing sowing date improved spikes per m(2) (27.4%) and grains per head (12.9%), key measures to improving wheat grain yields. The high-yielding high-efficiency (H gamma LE) plots produced on average 43.0% and 14.6% higher nitrogen partial factor productivity and grain yield, respectively than the high-yielding low-efficiency (H gamma LE) plots. Appropriate nitrogen fertilizer inputs significantly enhanced nitrogen use efficiency and maintained grain yield on Hy plots. Grain yield and nitrogen partial factor productivity gradually increased with year of cultivar release (1995-2019) (P < 0.05). However, soil organic matter, pH, available phosphorus, mineral nitrogen, and available potassium had no significant effect on grain yield or nitrogen use efficiency. The H Y H E plots had the lowest nitrogen surplus (25 kg N ha(-1)), phosphorus surplus (31 kg P ha(-1)), and greenhouse gas emissions (2327 kg CO2-eq ha(-1)) of the surveyed plots. In the Hy plots, moderate potassium fertilizer should be supplemented to balance wheat production. In conclusion, excellent cultivars and high plant density are key for bridging the yield gap between L-gamma and H-gamma plots. Optimizing fertilizer management could further promote H-gamma plots from low to high production efficiency. This research provides farmers with the knowledge and methods to sustainably bridge field-level yield gaps in dryland wheat production.					zhang, hao/JOJ-7093-2023; Siddique, Kadambot H.M./B-3462-2011	Siddique, Kadambot H.M./0000-0001-6097-4235													0378-4290	1872-6852				FEB 1	2022	276								108374	10.1016/j.fcr.2021.108374	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2021.108374		NOV 2021											WOS:000724686000003

P.; Tomar, Sandeep S.; Singh, Sudhir			Effect of precise levelling, tillage and seed sowing methods of pearlmillet based cropping systems on productivity and soil quality in dryland area	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Pearlmillet (PM) - Indian mustard (IM) is a major cropping system of dryland areas having some provision for supplemental irrigation either from groundwater or seasonal canal water supplies. In India, quite for some time, the PM-IM cropping system has been showing signs of stress and decline in system productivity and profitability, primarily due to deteriorating soil quality associated with the inability of the PM-IM growers to return any crop residues back to the soil. The objective of research study conducted during 2014-17 could improve the soil quality, productivity of the system and make it more profitable was to find if shift from traditional to an innovative conservation agriculture (CA) farming system. The study was conducted on rainy season PM based four dry winter season crops involving an IM and three legume crops- chickpea (CP), fieldpea (FP) and lentil (L) under two methods of land levelling viz. conventional (CLL) and precision laser-assisted land levelling (PLL), and three tillage and seed sowing (TSS) methods- conventional tillage (CT), zero tillage (ZT) and permanent raised broad bed- furrow (PBBF). The results of PLL and PBBF seed sowing significantly enhanced the soil quality parameters, yield attributing characters, productivity of rainy and winter season crops and of the cropping systems, net returns and water use efficiency (WUE) as compared with the conventional practices. Improvement in soil quality parameters and performance of the cropping systems followed the order: PM-CP > PM-L > PM-FP > PM-IM. Research study showed that TSS method with PBBF with in conjunction PLL can further make this system more productive and economically profitable, uplift soil quality and save resources.																			0167-1987	1879-3444				AUG	2021	212								105069	10.1016/j.still.2021.105069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2021.105069		MAY 2021											WOS:000659204700009

These structural and functional shifts are often assumed to impact wildlife but this has rarely been measured directly. Likewise, evaluation of weed removal programs rarely considers benefits to fauna, thereby limiting information that could inform management decisions. We used an experimental approach to test the impacts of removing invasive buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris), a globally significant invader of dryland systems, on reptiles, a prominent component of the Australian desert fauna. A combination of mechanical and herbicide treatment was applied to replicate plots in areas that had been invaded for at least two decades and changes to ground cover and plant and reptile assemblages were monitored over six years and compared to still-invaded control plots. Following treatment, native plants re-established without the need for reseeding or planting, especially during a period of high rainfall, when positive effects on reptiles also became apparent. The abundance and species richness of reptiles increased at all plots during the mesic period, but less so in control plots, and remained higher at treated plots thereafter, although this was only significant at some times. Post-treatment 27 of 36 species were captured more frequently in treated plots and only four species, all with very low captures, were captured more often in invaded control plots. This consistent trend among species suggests negative impacts of buffel grass on reptiles are likely caused by broad factors such as reduced prey or habitat diversity. Together with concurrent research at the same sites, our results provide experimental evidence that removing buffel grass from heavily invaded areas, even at small scales, benefits a variety of native flora and fauna. Until landscape-scale options are available, restoration of smaller areas within buffel-invaded landscapes can help to pre serve native seed banks and adult plants, reduce fire impacts, and provide patches of favourable habitat for fauna. The creation of 'islands' of restored native vegetation deserves further consideration as an effective intervention that could help to achieve short and long-term conservation goals in grass-invaded dryland ecosystems.

Strong Correspondence in Evapotranspiration and Carbon Dioxide Fluxes Between Different Eddy Covariance Systems Enables Quantification of Landscape Heterogeneity in Dryland Fluxes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The eddy covariance method is widely used to investigate fluxes of energy, water, and carbon dioxide at landscape scales, providing important information on how ecological systems function. Flux measurements quantify ecosystem responses to environmental perturbations and management strategies, including nature-based climate-change mitigation measures. However, due to the high cost of conventional instrumentation, most eddy covariance studies employ a single system, limiting spatial representation to the flux footprint. Insufficient replication may be limiting our understanding of ecosystem behavior. To address this limitation, we deployed eight lower-cost eddy covariance systems in two clusters around two conventional eddy covariance systems in the Chihuahuan Desert of North America for a period of 2 years. These dryland settings characterized by large temperature variations and relatively low carbon dioxide fluxes represented a challenging setting for eddy covariance. We found very good closure of energy and water balance across all systems (within +/- 9% of unity). We found very good correspondence between the lower-cost and conventional systems' fluxes of sensible heat (with concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of >= 0.87), latent energy (evapotranspiration; CCC >= 0.89), and useful correspondence in the net ecosystem exchange ((NEE); with CCC >= 0.4) at the daily temporal resolution. Relative to the conventional systems, the low-frequency systems were characterized by a higher level of random error, particularly in the NEE fluxes. Lower-cost systems can enable wider deployment affording better replication and sampling of spatiotemporal variability at the expense of greater measurement noise that might be limiting for certain applications. Replicated eddy covariance observations may be useful when addressing gaps in the existing monitoring of critical and underrepresented ecosystems and for measuring areas larger than a single flux footprint.

Quantifying soil respiration rates in these environments is often complicated by the presence of calcium carbonates, which are a common feature of dryland soils. We show with high-precision O-2 measurements in a laboratory potted soil experiment that respiration rates after watering were similar in control and carbonate treatment soils. However, CO2 concentrations were up to 72% lower in the carbonate treatment soil because CO2 was initially consumed during calcite dissolution. Subsequently, CO2 concentrations were over 166% greater in the carbonate treatment soil as respiration slowed and calcite precipitated, releasing CO2. Elevated delta C-13 values of soil CO2 (>6 parts per thousand higher in the treatment than control) confirm that observed differences were due to calcite dissolution. These findings demonstrate that calcite dissolution and precipitation can occur rapidly enough to affect soil gas compositions and that changes in soil CO2 are not always directly related to changes in soil respiration rates. Studies of local soil respiration rates and carbon exchange are likely to be influenced by dissolution and precipitation of calcium carbonates in soils. We estimate that one fifth of global soil respiration occurs in soils that contain some amount of soil carbonate, underscoring the need to account for its obscuring effects when trying to quantify soil respiration and net ecosystem exchange on a regional or global scale.

Shrub influence on soil carbon and nitrogen in a semi-arid grassland is mediated by precipitation and largely insensitive to livestock grazing	ARID LAND RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT												Dryland (arid and semi-arid) ecosystems globally provide more than half of livestock production and store roughly one-third of soil organic carbon (SOC). Biogeochemical pools are changing due to shrub encroachment, livestock grazing, and climate change. We assessed how vegetation microsite, grazing, and precipitation interacted to affect SOC and total nitrogen (TN) at a site with long-term grazing manipulations and well-described patterns of shrub encroachment across elevation and mean annual precipitation (MAP) gradients. We analyzed SOC and TN in the context of vegetation cover at ungrazed locations within livestock exclosures, high-intensity grazing locations near water sources, and moderate-intensity grazing locations away from water. SOC was enhanced by MAP (p < 0.0001), but grazing intensity had little effect regardless of MAP (p = 0.12). Shrubs enhanced SOC (300-1279 g C m(-2)) and TN (27-122 g N m(-2)), except at high MAP where the contribution or stabilization of shrub inputs relative to grassland inputs was likely diminished. Cover of perennial herbaceous plants and litter were significant predictors of SOC (r(2) = 0.63 and 0.34, respectively) and TN (r(2) = 0.64 and 0.30, respectively). Our results suggest that continued shrub encroachment in drylands can increase SOC storage when grass production remains high, although this response may saturate with higher MAP. In contrast, grazing - at least at the intensities of our sites - has a lesser effect. These effects underscore the need to understand how future climate and grazing may interact to influence dryland biogeochemical cycling.

Recently enacted regulations limiting groundwater withdrawals and the potential for farm profitability with cotton production systems indicate driving forces for increased cotton production acreage in the Northern High Plains of Texas (NHPT). This study focused on evaluating the land-use change from corn or winter wheat to cotton under irrigation and dryland conditions in the Palo Duro watershed (PDW) in the NHPT using an improved Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Land-use change from irrigated corn to irrigated cotton led to reductions in average (2000-2014) annual irrigation, actual evapotranspiration (ETa), and surface runoff by 21%, 7%, and 63%, respectively. Nevertheless, the replacement of irrigated wheat with irrigated cotton caused irrigation and ETa to increase by 46% and 18%, respectively. Land-use conversion from dryland wheat to dryland cotton showed 0.1% and 15% decreases in ETa and surface runoff, respectively. More than 40% reductions in simulated cotton yields were found when the cotton planting area was moving northward to the cooler NHPT. The ongoing change in land use provided an option to lengthen the water availability of the southern Ogallala Aquifer for irrigation.

Landscape-scale cropping changes in the High Plains: economic and environmental implications	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												A global transformation in semi-arid cropping systems is occurring as dryland (non-irrigated) farmers in semi-arid regions shift from crop rotations reliant on year-long bare fallows, called summer fallow, to more intensively cropped systems. Understanding the rate of cropping system intensification at the landscape scale is critical to estimating the economic and environmental implications of this movement. Here, we use high-resolution satellite data to quantify dryland cropping patterns from 2008 to 2016 in the US High Plains. We use these estimates to scale up our previous field-level research in this region on soil carbon, herbicide use, yields, and profitability. Over the nine year study period, the High Plains witnessed a profound shift in cropping systems, as the historically dominant wheat-fallow system was replaced by more intensified rotations as the dominant systems by land area. Out of the 4 million hectares of non-irrigated cropland in the study area, this shift coincided with a 0.5 million-hectare decline in summer fallow and a concurrent increase in alternative (non-wheat) crops. We estimate that, from 2008 to 2016, these patterns resulted in a 0.53 Tg (9%) increase in annual grain production, 80 million USD (10%) increase in annual net farm operating income, substantial reductions in herbicide use, and an increase in C sequestration that corresponds to greenhouse gas reductions of 0.32 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents per year (MMTCO(2)e yr(-1)). We project each of these implications to a scenario of potential maximum 100% intensification and estimate that, relative to 2016 levels, herbicide use would be reduced by more than half, grain production would increase by 25%, net operating income would increase by 223 million USD (26%), and greenhouse gases would be reduced by an additional 0.8MMTCO(2)e yr(-1). The scale of cropping intensification in the High Plains and its environmental and economic impacts has important implications for other regions undergoing similar transformations, and for policy that can either support or hinder these shifts toward more sustainable cropping systems.																			1748-9326					DEC	2019	14	12							124088	10.1088/1748-9326/ab5e8b	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab5e8b													WOS:000514833700005

Despite its clear potential to tackle the dryland dynamics, the tradition of pastoralism in Kutch has been systematically denigrated and marginalised in the district over the years. Drawing on research conducted in eastern Kutch, and along the coast, this article shows how pastoralist communities have been displaced from a range of vital hydric resources - such as mangroves and water sources - in the name of development and conservation. Together, these have accelerated processes of dispossession and exacerbated both 'old' and 'new' resource scarcities.

To understand the initial effects of the transition of tilled cotton systems to no-tillage with winter wheat as a cover crop, we sampled 18 commercial grower sites from 2019 to 2022 in the Southern High Plains (SHP). We evaluated the soil biological component, which often responds rapidly to changes in residue additions or minimized soil disturbance providing an early indication of changes in soil health, especially in the low organic matter soils in this region. After two years, compared to tilled systems, no-till systems had significant increases in ester-linked fatty acid methyl ester (EL-FAME) bacterial and saprophytic and AMF fungal markers, enzyme activities of nutrient cycling, and various SOM pools, under both center-pivot irrigation and dryland. Similar increases were also observed in two dryland sites sampled before and up to two years after transition to no-till. Our study demonstrates the potential of no-tillage and cover crops to improve soil health in cotton production in semiarid regions, and a framework for a soil health assessment that links different soil health indicators with functions related to soil organic matter, soil water, and biogeochemical cycling.

Dung beetles and nutrient cycling in a dryland environment	CATENA												Insects are involved in the biogeochemical cycles of multiple elements and influence soil fertility. In particular, soil insects and the functions that they support can affect the response of terrestrial ecosystems to environmental changes. We experimentally studied the role of dung beetles as recyclers of cow dung in drylands of the Central Monte in mid-western Argentina; and we extrapolated these results to ecosystem impact in a grazing field, considering the dung beetle's abundance in summer. We conducted experiments with four species of dung beetles (Sulcophanaeus imperator, Eucranium arachnoides, Digitonthophagus gazelle and Malagoniella puncticollis), and quantified their abundance on the field. Dung beetles incorporated nitrogen, ammonium, and phosphorous to the soil, but this activity varied substantially among species. The highest quantity of organic matter, nitrogen and phosphate was incorporated to the soil by S. imperator, one of the larger beetle studied. While the per capita effect of S. imperator is superior to other species studied, the impact on the ecosystem of the invasive D. gazelle might be superior due to their major abundance in grazing fields. Our results highlight the importance of considering both components, per capita effect and abundance, to estimate with more reliability the relative importance of dung beetle species. Given that the effect of dung beetles on nutrient cycling is variable among species, and their abundance is variable in space, it is important to conserve beetle diversity in order to maximize their beneficial impacts on soils. Therefore, dung beetle effect on soil might be crucial in drylands to mitigate the nitrogen losses caused by grazing.

This is an important reason behind why it is difficult to identify BTH units in subsurface reservoirs. A Middle Jurassic dryland sandy braided river outcrop in northwestern China is characterized in this study through the application of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveying and mapping, and ground penetrating radar (GPR). A workflow of UAV data processing has been established, and a 3D digital outcrop model has been built. By observation and measurement of the outcrop model and GPR profiles, two types of BTH filled units were found: (a) sandstone-filled, and (b) mudstone-filled hollows. Both of these units were located between two adjacent bar units in an area that is limited to a compound bar, and were developed in the upper part of a braided bar depositional sequence. The ellipse-shaped, sandstone-filled unit measures 10 m x 27 m in map view and reaches a maximum thickness of 5 m. The transversal cross-section across the BTHs displays a concave upward basal surface, while the angle of the inclined structures infilling the BTHs decreases up-section. The GPR data show that, in the longitudinal profile, the basal surface is relatively flat, and low-angle, inclined layers can be observed in the lower- and middle part of the sandstone-filled BTHs. In contrast, no obvious depositional structures were observed in the mudstone-filled BTH in outcrop. The new understanding of BTH has a wide application, including the optimization of CO2 storage sites, fresh water aquifers exploration, and oil and gas reservoir characterization.						zhang, xian guo/0000-0002-1497-635X														2072-4292				FEB	2021	13	4							560	10.3390/rs13040560	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13040560													WOS:000624446200001

Rainfall pulses increased short-term biocrust chlorophyll but not fungal abundance or N availability in a long-term dryland rainfall manipulation experiment	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Microbial activity in drylands is mediated by the magnitude and frequency of growing season rain events that will shift as climate change progresses. Nitrogen is often co-limiting with water availability to dryland plants. This study investigated how microbes important to the nitrogen (N) cycle and soil N availability varied temporally and spatially in the context of a long-term rainfall variability experiment in the northern Chihuahuan Desert. Specifically, biological soil crust (biocrust) chlorophyll content, fungal abundance, and inorganic N were measured in soils adjacent to individuals of the grassland foundation species, Bouteloua eriopoda, and in the unvegetated interspace at multiple time points associated with experimental monsoon rainfall treatments. Treatments included 12 small weekly (5 mm) or 3 large monthly (20 nun) rain events, which had been applied during the summer monsoon for nine years prior to this study. Additionally, target plant C:N ratios were measured, and N-15-glutamate was added to biocrusts to determine potential for nutrient transport to B. eriopoda. Biocrust chlorophyll was up to 67% higher in the small weekly and large monthly rainfall treatments compared to ambient controls. Fungal biomass was 57% lower in soil interspaces than adjacent to plants but did not respond to rainfall treatments. Ammonium and nitrate concentrations near plants declined through the sampling period but varied little in soil interspaces. There was limited movement of N-15 from interspace biocrusts to leaves but high N-15 retention occurred in the soils even after additional ambient and experimental rain events. Plant C:N ratio was unaffected by rainfall treatments. The long-term alteration in rainfall regime in this experiment did not change how short-term microbial abundance or N availability responded to the magnitude or frequency of rain events at the end of the growing season, suggesting a limited response of N availability to future climate change.

These changes can be much faster and more intense in arid and semiarid areas that have been affected by intense human activities. Iran has climates from very humid to very dry, but arid and semiarid climates cover the country's largest area. Many of these arid areas have undergone severe changes in their surface and groundwater ecosystems in recent years, which have caused severe damage to humans and the environment in the area and surrounding areas. Therefore, in this study, using the theory of regime shifts, the time series of the Zayandeh-Rud River Basin in the center of Iran were analyzed. First, the data of the desired time series in the period of 1986-2018 was arranged seasonally. Then, using the sequential t-test method, regime shifts in these time series were identified, and then, causal loop diagrams of these shifts and their drivers and feedbacks were interpreted. The results showed that in the time series of quantity and quality of surface water and groundwater level in the studied stations and aquifers, regime shifts can be identified. Regime shifts were also identified in the time series of agricultural land area. These shifts have occurred with the increase in human activities since the early 1950s in the metropolis of Isfahan, the increase in agricultural and industrial exploitation, and consequently, the increase in population. When this reinforcing feedback loop becomes dominant, the Zayandeh-Rud River system has shifted from a regime of rich water resources to a regime of poor water resources. However, by recognizing and systematically analyzing these shifts, the Zayandeh-Rud River system can be directed toward a sustainable system through structural reform, negotiation, and redefining goals.

Ecosystems in these areas play an important role in determining the interannual variability of the global terrestrial carbon sink. Examining carbon fluxes of various types of dryland ecosystems and their responses to climatic variability is essential for improving projections of the carbon cycle in these regions. In this study, we made use of observations from a regional flux tower observation network in a typical arid endorheic basin, the Heihe river basin (HRB). As a representative area of both the arid region of China and the entire region of central Asia, the HRB includes the main ecosystems in arid regions. We compared the spatial variations of carbon fluxes of five terrestrial ecosystems (i.e., grassland, cropland, desert, wetland, and forest ecosystems) and explored the responses of ecosystem carbon fluxes to climatic factors across different ecosystems. We found that our region exhibits a carbon sink ranging from 85.9 to 508.7 gC/m(2)/yr for different ecosystems, and the water availability is critical to the spatial variability of carbon fluxes in arid regions. Carbon fluxes across all sites exhibited weak correlations with temperature and precipitation. Marked differences in precipitation effects were observed between the sites within oases and those outside of oases. Irrigation and groundwater recharge were of great importance to the variations in carbon fluxes for the sites within oases. Evapotranspiration (ET) exhibited strong relationships with carbon fluxes, indicating that ET was a better metric of soil water availability than was precipitation in driving the spatial variability of carbon fluxes in arid regions. This study has implications for better understanding the carbon budget of terrestrial ecosystems and informing ecological management in dryland regions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, the mechanistic relationship between evapotranspiration and leaf temperature remains poorly constrained. In this study, we present a novel mechanistic model to predict leaf temperature as a linearized function of the evaporative fraction. The model is validated using measurements from infrared radiometers mounted on two flux towers in Arizona, USA, which measure canopies of Prosopis velutina with contrasting water availability. Both the observations and model predictions reveal that leaf temperature equilibrates with air temperature when latent heat flux consumes all of the energy incident on the leaf surface. Leaf temperature exceeds air temperature when there is a net input of energy into the leaf tissue. The flux tower observations revealed that evaporative cooling reduced canopy leaf temperature by ca. 1-5 degrees C, depending on water availability. Evaporative cooling also enhanced net carbon uptake by reducing leaf respiration by ca. 15% in the middle of the growing season. The regulation of leaf temperature by evapotranspiration and the resulting impact on net carbon uptake represents an important link between plant water and carbon cycles that has received little attention in literature. The model presented here provides a mechanistic framework to quantify leaf evaporative cooling and examine its impacts on plant physiological function.

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of crop rotation and N fertilization rate on soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes and C balance under dryland farming from 2012 to 2016 in the northern Great Plains, USA. Treatments were two crop rotations (continuous spring wheat [Triticum aestivum L.], CW; and spring wheat-pea [Pisum sativum L.], WP) and four N fertilization rates (0, 50, 100, and 150 kg N ha(-1)) applied to spring wheat. The soil CO2 flux peaked immediately after planting, fertilization, and intense precipitation (>15 mm in a day) when the emissions varied among treatments. Treatment did not affect soil CH4 uptake, except that the uptake varied with N fertilization rate in 2015-2016. Cumulative annual soil CO2 flux was 35-55% greater with CW than WP at 50-150 kg N ha(-1) in 2013-2014 and 2015-2016, but was 37% greater with WP than CW at 100 kg N ha(-1) in 2014-2015. Mean cumulative soil CH4 flux was 34% greater with CW than WP at 0 kg N ha(-1), but was 16% greater with WP than CW at 150 kg N ha(-1). Yield-scaled soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes were unaffected (P > 0.05) by treatments, but varied among years. Carbon balance was negative and unaffected by treatments. Results showed that soil CO2 emissions can be reduced by using legume-nonlegume crop rotation with reduced N fertilization rate with limited impact on soil CH4 emissions. Dryland spring wheat-based cropping systems was a carbon source in the semiarid region. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We found ITAVE group students had significantly (p<0.05) higher cognitive, affective and phsycomotoric out outcomes, compared to the DI group. The ITAVE group also had better agronomic skills. We conclude the ITAVE base practical for agriculture vocational students improves learning outcomes, better than the DI approach.																			1811-9506	2218-3973				APR-JUN	2019	16	2					949	955																WOS:000477770300009

Conservation tillage rotation is considered to be an effective method that can better alleviate these threats if the plowing method is retained and incorporated into the popular no-tillage and subsoiling rotation systems. With this in mind, a long-term (2007-2018), plowing-based conservation rotational tillage experiment was established in an extraordinarily semi-arid region in Heyang Country, Shaanxi Province, China. Four treatments were applied: (1) a three-year rotation where the first year was no-tillage, the second year rotated via alternate plowing, and the third year was subsoiling tillage (NPS); (2) a two-year rotation alternating annual subsoiling tillage with plowing (SP); (3) a two-year rotation alternating annual plowing tillage with no-tillage (PN); and (4) continuous annual plowing (P). After the 11-year experiment, three rotational systems (NPS, SP, and PN) had significantly ameliorated soil bulk density (BD), porosity, and water-stable aggregates (WSA). Especially when compared to the P treatment, the SP rotation significantly reduced mean BD (5.19 %) and increased porosity (5.69 %) at 0-60 cm soil depth. This happened with higher amounts of water-stable macro-aggregates (26.92 %), and may have a synergetic relationship between the WSA of 2-5 and 0.25-2 mm at 30-40 cm soil depth. Also this significantly enhanced the average soil water storage (0-200 cm) under wet rainfall patterns (500.50 mm), and even occurred in extremely dry (391.37 mm) and wet (566.26 mm) years; as well significantly promoted the average water use efficiency (7.25 %) and yield (8.37 %), respectively. Overall, the SP rotation is a suitable agricultural tillage scenario for ameliorating soil bulk density, porosity, water-stable aggregates, water use and storage, yields, and profits that meet the variable climate of dryland farming ecosystem in the future.					wang, xiao/HZI-9156-2023; hao, wang/IXN-0703-2023; wang, yu/IUQ-6654-2023; Chen, Shuo/JEO-6350-2023; Li, June/JEF-1173-2023	hao, wang/0000-0002-5109-7194; 													0167-1987	1879-3444				MAY	2020	199								104600	10.1016/j.still.2020.104600	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2020.104600													WOS:000521110000025

The objective of this study was to determine the persistence over time of the effect of subsoiling, as a tool to reduce soil compaction, on a soil under crop rotation-grazing. A field experiment was established for 5 consecutive seasons (t). Soil compaction was measured at a depth of 0-45 cm, using the Cone Index as an indicator and considering >= 2000 kPa as compacted soil. The diagnosis was conducted in 2015 (t(0)), while the experimental trials started in 2016 (t(1)) when oats were sown on a site with two different treatments: 'Subsoiling' and 'No subsoiling'. The obtained results showed that subsoiling increased yield by 14.9% compared to the no subsoiling treatment. Subsequently, the experimental site was used for grazing without animal load control from 2017 to 2020 (t(1)-t(5)). During this period, the persistence of the effect of subsoiling on the experimental site was evaluated by measuring soil compaction of a depth of 0-45 cm and contrasting the values to those obtained in 2015 (t(0)). In the last season (t(5)), the 0-10 cm profile showed surface compaction, which was attributed to grazing. It can be concluded that compaction levels (kPa) return to the original levels (t(0)) from the second season after subsoiling (t(2)), which ends the residual effect derived from the use of this tool.																			0719-3882	0719-3890					2022	38	2					224	233		10.29393/CHJAA38-22PEMJ20022	http://dx.doi.org/10.29393/CHJAA38-22PEMJ20022													WOS:001077705500009

PUE is determined by a complicated process of precipitation use in farmland, which includes several sequential steps: precipitation infiltrates into the soil, the infiltrated precipitation is stored in soil, the soil-stored precipitation is consumed through transpiration or evaporation, transpired precipitation is used to produce dry-matter, and finally dry-matter is re-allocated to grains. These steps can be quantified by six ratios: precipitation infiltration ratio (SW/SWe; SW, total available water; SWe, available soil water storage at the end of a specific period), precipitation storage ratio (SWe/P; P, effective precipitation), precipitation consumption ratio (ET/SW; ET, evapotranspiration), ratio of crop transpiration to evapotranspiration (T/ET; T, crop transpiration), transpiration efficiency (B/T; B, the increment of shoot biomass) and harvest index (Y/B; Y, grain yield). The final efficiency is then calculated as: PUE= SWe/P x SW/SWe x ET/SW x T/ET x B/T x Y/B. Quantifying each of those ratios is crucial for the planning and execution of PUE improvements and for optimizing the corresponding agronomic practices in a specific agricultural system. In this study, those ratios were quantified and evaluated under four integrated agronomic management systems. Our study revealed that PUE and wheat yield were significantly increased by 8-31% under manure (MIS) or biochar (BIS) integrated systems compared to either conventional farmers' (CF) or high N (HN) integrated systems. In the infiltration and storage steps, MIS and BIS resulted in lower SWe/ P but higher SW/SWe compared with CF and HN. Regarding the consumption step, the annual ET/SW under MIS and BIS did not increase due to the higher ET after regreening and the lower ET before regreening compared with CF or HN. The T/ET was significantly higher under MIS and BIS than under CF or HN. In the last two steps, transpiration efficiency and harvest index were less strongly affected by the agronomic management system, although both values varied considerably across the different experimental years. Therefore, attempts to achieve higher PUE and yields in rainfed wheat through agronomic management should focus on increasing the T/ET and SW/SWe, while maintaining ET/SW throughout the year and keeping SWe/P relatively low at harvest time.

However, the mechanisms under-lying the positive effect of SMNT on wheat tillering are not fully elucidated. A split-plot experiment was designed to investigate the combined effects of SMNT and cultivars on tillering of dryland wheat grown under both dry and favorable climates. Application of SMNT to a cultivar with 1-2 tillers exploited both tillering and kernel-number plasticity, increasing the mean grain yield by 20.5%. This increase was attrib-uted primarily to an increased first-tiller emergence rate resulting from increased N uptake, leaf N con-tent, and N remobilization from tillers to their grain. The second and third tillers, as transient sinks, contributed to the tiller survival rate, which depends on tiller leaf number. The increased total N uptake by SMNT also increased the dry mass yield of tillers and the C:N ratio, reducing the asymmetric compe-tition between main stem and tillers. Owing to these beneficial effects, reduced mitogen-activated pro-tein kinase (MAPK) and abscisic acid signals were observed under SMNT, whereas indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) signals and genes involved in DNA replication and mismatch repair were increased. These signals activated three critical transcription factors (the calmodulin-binding transcription activator, GRAS domain, and cysteine-2/histidine-2 family) and further increased rapid drought response and tiller main-tenance after stem extension. Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, sphingolipid biosynthesis, and galactose metabolism were most relevant to increased tillering under SMNT because of their critical role in drought response and lignin biosynthesis. Our results suggest that straw mulch-based no-tillage activates rapid drought response and improved wheat tillering by coordinating root N uptake, N remobilization, and asymmetric competition between main stem and tillers.(c) 2021 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS.

Understanding the yield formation and its relation to the N uptake and requirement are urgently needed to reduce the nitrate-N residue for plastic mulched wheat production in drylands. A three-year location-fixed field experiment with five N rates was carried out to test the grain yield formation and N use characteristics of wheat and soil nitrate-N response to no mulch (NM) and plastic film mulch (PM) cultivations. Obtained results showed that the PM promoted the wheat growth and had higher maximum grain yield and biomass at the similar N rate, compared to the NM. Although wheat took up much more N from the soils under the PM, its N requirement for 1000 kg grain formation (N-R) showed no significant difference from that of the NM, and for management of N fertilization, the same N-R can be used for both cultivations in dryland. Nitrate-N content in 0-20 cm top soil (S-NC) was found lower under NM than that under PM, but nitrate-N residue in 0-100 cm soil (S-NR) showed no significant difference between these two cultivations. The S-NR was significantly and linearly correlated with the S-NC under both cultivations, and thus the S-NC is able to be used to predict the S-NR. Therefore, the present work provides a feasible way or an idea to use the top soil nitrate content, wheat grain yield and its N requirement to optimize the N application rates and N fertilizer recommendation for wheat production and soil nitrate-N residue control in dryland.

However, there is still a need to better understand the impact of various fertilization practices on CSE. We studied the data from eight long-term experiments located in the main dryland region of China in order to comprehensively assess the key drivers of CSE in the plow layer considering nearly four decades of various fertilizer treatments, i.e., no fertilizer (CK); chemical nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK/NP); chemical fertilizers plus manure (NPKM/NPM/NM); and straw (NPKS/NPS/NS). Our results showed that manure amendment had the most significant fertilization effect on SOC sequestration with an average CSE of 14.9%, which was significantly higher than that of chemical fertilization (9.0%) and straw return treatments (7.9%). In addition, manure amendment also had the highest average SOC increase rate of 684 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Variance partitioning analysis (VPA) illustrated that the CSE of the main dryland region of China was mostly controlled by edaphic characteristics (32.2%), especially the soil C/N ratio and clay content. VPA and structural equation modeling revealed that the magnitude and influencing factors driving CSE varied among different fertilizer treatments. Soil total N was the limiting factor for CSE in the CK treatment, whereas the soil C/N ratio and pH were the main explanatory factors for CSE in the long-term chemical NPK fertilizer treatment. The negative impact of C input from straw was the main driver of CSE under straw return treatments, though C input had a positive effect on the improvement of soil physical properties. However, when considering manure amendments, the improvement of soil nutrients and clay content controlled CSE, underlining the main positive direct effect of soil chemical properties. In a nutshell, our results recommend manure plus chemical fertilizers as a sustainable practice for improving the C sequestration rate and efficiency in dryland cropping systems.

Overcoming field barriers to restore dryland soils by cyanobacteria inoculation	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Cyanobacteria inoculation to promote biocrust formation and improve soil properties has shown positive results in indoor studies, but limited success when applied under field conditions. Successful results of application of this technology in the field have been only found in desert sand dunes in China. Therefore, further development of this technique is necessary to extend its applicability to other soil types and regions. In this study, we inoculated a consortium of three N-fixing native cyanobacteria (Nostoc commune, Scytonema hyalinum and Tolypothrix distorta) on degraded soils from three semiarid study sites in south-eastern Spain with differing soil properties and soil development. After two years, chlorophyll a spectral absorption and albedo in inoculated and control plots were similar. Consequently, a second experiment was conducted to test the effectiveness of progressive cyanobacterial preacclimation before inoculation as well as the use of habitat amelioration techniques, consisting of covering the inoculated soils with a vegetal fiber mesh or a plastic grid, to improve cyanobacteria performance. Our results showed that: 1) hardening these cyanobacterial strains did not enhance their colonization capability, and 2) covering inoculated soils with a vegetal mesh did promote soil colonization by cyanobacteria, as shown by higher chlorophyll a soil content and Chla spectral absorption and lower albedo than in the uncovered plots. Moreover, it promoted the presence of more condensed, tightly-bound exopolysaccharides (EPS) and higher molecular weight molecules in the more soluble loosely-bound EPS fraction, both of which could be involved in the improvement of soil aggregation. Finally, higher abundance of xylose and galactose was also found in this treatment, likely indicating a greater development of the induced biocrusts. The results of this study show that direct soil inoculation with cyanobacteria, whether subjected to desiccation hardening or not, did not promote the artificial formation of biocrusts in the field. However, more positive results were found when the inoculated soils were covered with a vegetal mesh to help cyanobacteria cope with abiotic stress and soil erosion. Therefore, developing diversified efficient habitat amelioration strategies might be key in the successful application of this restoration technique in the field.

This is the case of the badlands, highly eroded arid ecosystems without vegetation, which have been extensively analysed from a physical point of view, but hardly studied from the point of view of the benefits they provide to society. This paper aimed to determine the social preferences for and the relative importance of the ES provided by badlands. To achieve this objective, a representative sample of the population was taken from the Region of Murcia (Spain), a semiarid Mediterranean area with an abundant presence of these ecosystems. This study area is of additional interest for the provision of ES derived from agroecosystems. The contingent ranking method was used to identify aspects such as the utility provided by the different types of ES and the social well-being derived from different management policies to be implemented. The results show a preference of the population for cultural ES and biodiversity in the badlands. Given that the implementation of badlands ES protection and a management policy based on the maintenance of agricultural ES are the two strategies that yield the highest social well-being, the provisioning and regulating ES derived from agroecosystems in the area should be evaluated simultaneously, given the trade-off that can occur between the two ecosystems. These results provide dryland ecosystem managers with a view of soil erosion management that is different from the traditional one, since it promotes not only its control, but also a greater presence of educational and recreational activities.

Vegetation cover reveals the phase diagram of patch patterns in drylands	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS												Drylands are ecosystems with limited water resources, often subjected to desertification. Conservation and restoration efforts towards these ecosystems depend on the interplay between ecological functioning and spatial patterns formed by local vegetation. Despite recent advances on the subject, an adequate description of phase transitions between the various vegetated phases remains an open issue. Here, we gather vegetation data of drylands from Southern Spain using satellite images. Our findings support three vegetated phases, separated by two distinct phase transitions, including a continuous one, with new relations between scaling exponents of ecological variables. The phase diagram is obtained without a priori assumption about underlying ecological dynamics. We apply our analysis to a different dryland system in the Western United States and verify a compatible critical behavior, in agreement with the universality hypothesis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Optimized fertilization further promotes fertilizer utilization efficiencies. In this study, plastic film mulching was extended from plant growth season to summer fallow, and fertilizers were applied by monitoring soil nutrient availability. Field trials were conducted in the dryland of the Loess Plateau over 4 years by using four types of cultivation to investigate the effects of year-round plastic film mulching with monitored fertilization on utilization efficiencies of rainwater and nitrogen (N), and winter wheat yield. The four types of cultivation were farmer practice (FP), ridge-furrow with plastic film mulching system plus conventional fertilization (RPCF), ridge-furrow with plastic film mulching system plus monitored fertilization (RPFM), and flat soil surface with plastic film mulching system plus monitored fertilization (FPFM). Our results indicate that the average yield of winter wheat in RPFM and FPFM treatments was 4491 kg ha(-1). Compared with FP treatment, the combined effects of monitored fertilization and film mulching(RPFM and FPFM treatments) could increase grain yield in the range of 24.7 to 42.1%. The film mulching extended to the fallow season increased the water storage in 2 m depth of soil profile, and the amount of soil water storage in the summer fallow period increased by 27 to 30% in FPFM treatment than FP treatment. After 4-year consecutive planting of wheat, the accumulation of nitrate-N in 2 m soil reached 277 kg.ha(-1) in the FP treatment, which is 87.7% higher than of the level at the beginning of the experiment. Seventy-five percent of nitrate-N was distributed in the soil layer of 0-120 cm. In addition, the residual nitrate-N showed downward leaching with rainfall during the experiment. The RPFM and FPFM treatments reduced the apparent loss and residual levels of soil N, whereas increased its apparent mineralization compared with FP treatment. The FPFM treatment exhibited a greater utilization of residual nitrate-N from previous years and showed a higher amount of the mineralized N from soil organic matter, therefore leading to a relatively high apparent utilization rate of N (56.7%). Considering both grain yield production and utilization efficiencies of water and N, FPFM with year-round mulching was the most effective cultivation measure for winter wheat in the Loess Plateau.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2019	26	10					9524	9535		10.1007/s11356-019-04337-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-04337-5								30725261					WOS:000464852200010

To fill this gap, a new systematic analysis method was developed to quantify crop yield, economic input and environment impact of farmland. Taking the farmland ecosystems of Loess Plateau (LP) in China during 2014-2018 as a case, this new systematic analysis method was applied to quantify the ecological environment, systematic sustainability, and socioeconomic characteristics (indicators) of the farmland ecosystems in dry farming. Then, by exploring the relationships of these indicators and combining with crop switching analysis, the relatively unsustainable counties in farming and the improving potential of sustainable crop production was clarified, respectively. Several interesting results were explored. (1) The counties with the farmland of grey-water footprints exceeding 500 m3/t or soil erosion empowers exceeding 1.5E+12 sej/ha could be categorized as the relatively unsustainable counties in farming. (2) Maize and sorghum showed superior performance in terms of both environmental sustainability and crop productivity, and had promotion advantages in LP. (3) Crop switching could reduce grey water footprint and soil erosion of farmland by up to 27.41% and 35.14% respectively, and increase emergy sustainability index and crop yield by up to 10.35% and 19.90% respectively. The integrated systematic analysis method and crop switching method has high application value for regional sustainable crop production, especially for dryland regions with fragile ecological environment and prominent food demand-supply conflict.

Soils had significantly higher organic matter under C. propinqua and significantly higher nitrate and phosphorus concentrations under K. serotina than soils in the adjacent open grassland. A bioassay using oat (Avena sativa) growth indicated higher fertility in soils from under K. serotina than from under grassland. A review of 28 other studies revealed that fertile island effects of woody plant species on soil nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations decreased significantly with increases in annual precipitation. The occurrence of fertile islands under only two of the four shrub species in the current study in a dry sub-humid environment is consistent with this trend of decreased fertile island effect with increased annual precipitation. The higher concentration of nitrogen in soils under woody plants such as C. propinqua may be explained by the plants depositing organic matter on the surface, but some species such as K. serotina, D. toumatou, R. rubiginosa and C. propinqua, may also preferentially establish in areas of high soil phosphorus availability. I conclude that the occurrence of fertile islands under woody plants may be due to both effects of the woody plant canopy, and the plants preferentially establishing in areas of high soil fertility.

Dryland soil salinity and seasonal effects on leaf and xylem sap ecophysiological characteristics of native plant species	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The objective of this 3-year study was to investigate the relationships between soil salinity and ecophysiological responses of C-3 and C-4 native plant species around Lake Altham and Lake Coyrecup (both are salt lakes in Western Australia), and to evaluate their potential for use in the remediation of salt-affected soils. Three shrubs (Atriplex vesicaria, Tecticornia lepidosperma and T. indica) that grew in highly saline soil of average Na concentration greater than 300 mM had higher leaf delta C-13 and delta N-15 ratios. These species also had higher Na-to-K and Na-to-Ca ratios in both their leaves and stem xylem sap, indicating that these species accumulate high amounts of sodium in their tissues. In contrast, tree species Eucalyptus loxophleba, Casuarina obesa and Acacia acuminata grew in soil of average Na concentration of less than 100 mM and had lower values of delta N-15, delta C-13, Na content, and Na-to-K ratio in their leaves. These species also had lower xylem Na-to-K and Na-to-Ca ratios. Seasonal effects were observed in leaf total N content, leaf Na, xylem sap Na-to-K ratio and xylem sap Na-to-Ca ratio. Strong and significant positive correlations (r > 0.75; P < 0.01) were observed between soil Na concentration and ecophysiological responses, such as leaf Na contents, leaf delta N-15, xylem sap Na, xylem Na-to-K ratio and xylem Na-to-Ca ratio. Overall, Atr. vesicaria, T. lepidosperma, T. indica and Santalum acuminatum are good candidates for remediation of highly saline soils.

Previous studies primarily employed equation -based approaches to clarify this relationship, ignoring the state-dependent nature of ecological dynamics. Here, using 40 y of climate and productivity data from 48 grassland sites across Mongolia, we applied an equation-free, nonlinear time-series analysis to reveal sensitivity patterns of productivity to climate change and variability and clarify underlying mechanisms. We showed that productivity responded positively to annual precipitation in mesic regions but negatively in arid regions, with the opposite pattern observed for annual mean temperature. Furthermore, productivity responded negatively to decreasing annual aridity that integrated precipitation and temperature across Mongolia. Productivity responded negatively to interannual variability in precipitation and aridity in mesic regions but positively in arid regions. Overall, interannual temperature variability enhanced productivity. These response patterns are largely unrecognized; however, two mechanisms are inferable. First, time-delayed climate effects modify annual productivity responses to annual climate conditions. Notably, our results suggest that the sensitivity of annual productivity to increasing annual precipitation and decreasing annual aridity can even be negative when the negative time-delayed effects of annual precipitation and aridity on productivity prevail across time. Second, the proportion of plant species resistant to water and temperature stresses at a site determines the sensitivity of productivity to climate variability. Thus, we highlight the importance of nonlinear, state-dependent sensitivity of productivity to climate change and variability, accurately forecasting potential biosphere feedback to the climate system.

This topic has attracted increasing attention by researchers. To assess the response of soil properties to vegetation succession in arid regions of China, we measured the soil water content (SWC) to a depth of 5m and determined soil properties of surface (0-5 cm) and subsurface (20-25 cm) layers in areas of natural grasses (NGs) and planted shrubs (PSs). The patch size of Caragana korshinskii shrubs resulted in different soil water storage losses (small shrub patch: 206.67 +/- 35.58 mm; medium shrub patch: 416.88 +/- 35.12 mm; large shrub patch: 588.63 +/- 72.00 mm; degraded shrub patch: 740.54 +/- 17.00 mm). Shrub cover showed an initial increase but then decreased as shrubs extracted soil water from the deep soil layers (>1 m). The species richness index in the PSs decreased with increasing shrub patch sizes. Surface soil organic carbon (SOC), extractable nitrogen (NH4+-N and NH3--N), and available phosphorous contents and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (Ks) in the PSs were all significantly (p < 0.05) lower than those in NGs. Soil particles in the range of 0.002-02 mm explained 28.0% and 47.3% of the total variability of these surface indices under NGs and PSs, respectively. The differences in SOC, NH4+-N, NO3--N, Ks, and field capacity between the surface and subsurface layers declined significantly (p < 0.05). The introduction of shrubs affected the plant community by increasing the spatial heterogeneity of soil resources (e.g. water and nutrient contents). Therefore, the strong feedback between SWC and vegetation succession should be carefully considered when revegetating drylands. The evaluation of regional soil property responses to vegetation succession aids in a better understanding of soil water-vegetation feedback and provides important implications for future revegetation in arid regions.

Although characterized by older design, they are still commonly used at smaller and medium size farms in this region. Therefore, their optimal exploitation parameters are still of large importance for hay quality and production efficiency and sustainability. The exploitation parameters of all three mowers generally increased linearly with higher speeds, having high R-2 values (over 0,8), with rare exceptions. The regression coefficients b clearly showed that the self-propelled mower-conditioner achieved maximum increase in production performance (b = 0,3606), compared with the oscillatory (b = 0,1158) and rotary mowers (b = 0,1414). Mower design had a significant (p <= 0,001) effect on cutting and chopping losses, production performance, and specific fuel consumption (p <= 0,05). The tests confirmed the superiority of the self-propelled mower over the two mowers aggregated with tractors.

Impact of soil residual auxin herbicide on seedling emergence and biomass differs between soil types, water pulse event, and seedling species	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Synthetic-auxin herbicides are often used to control woody plants and aid in grassland restoration. Seed-based restoration is common alongside herbicide applications and there may be unintended effects of these herbicides on dryland plants at the seed and seedling stages. Additionally, abiotic conditions at the time of herbicide application may influence herbicide-soil-plant interactions. We conducted a greenhouse study to examine the effects of a common shrub-control herbicide mix and its interaction with soil type and a post-herbicide water pulse on common desert plant seeds and seedlings. In this greenhouse study, we found that a subset of species responded negatively to soil residual herbicide activity of a mixture of aminopyralid, clopyralid, and triclopyr at the seed and seedling stages. Species sensitive to soil herbicide residues were primarily shrub and forb species that are often the target species of herbicide applications for woody plant control, such as honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and creosote bush (Larrea tridentata). However, two shrub species (four-wing saltbush [Atriplex canescens], soaptree yucca [Yucca elata]) and one perennial grass species (Arizona cottontop [Digitaria californica]), which are used in dryland restoration projects, were found to be particularly sensitive to soil residual herbicide activity. Thus, if using these herbicides to control woody plants and restore herbaceous vegetation via active seeding or relying on the in situ seed bank, considerations should be given to what species are used in the seed mix, what species are already present in the soil seed bank, and other details of the circumstances of herbicide application.

There are totally drylands of 5.17 x 10(6) km(2) (above 80% of global total temperate desert area) in Central Asia (CAS), in which significant increases of temperature and changes of precipitation have been detected in recent decades. However, environment-induced changes in terrestrial carbon stocks of these dryland ecosystems have not been well investigated. With the Arid Ecosystem Model (AEM), this study was devoted to analyze spatiotemporal changes of carbon stocks in drylands over CAS during the past 35 years (1980-2014) and to quantify contributions to these changes of various factors, including temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric CO2 concentration. Over the study period, total stocks of vegetation carbon (VEGC), soil organic carbon (SOC), and litter carbon (LTRC) averaged 2.8 +/- 0.05 Pg C, 45.2 +/- 0.01 Pg C, and 0.3 +/- 0.004 Pg C(1Pg = 10(15) g) in CAS, respectively. Meanwhile, total carbon (TOTC) declined by 0.7 Pg C. Climate change caused TOTC to decrease by 1.3 Pg C. In contrast, CO2 enrichment effect caused TOTC to increase by 0.9 Pg C. The effects of different factors on TOTC changes varied spatially. Precipitation was the dominant factor regulating TOTC change in 40.9% of the study area, mainly in the desert sparse shrub region in northwest Kazakhstan and the dryland region of southern Xinjiang of China, in which vegetation growth was mainly limited by water resource. CO2 dominated the change of TOTC in 38.3% of the study area, mainly in the lower altitude regions of Tianshan mountain, in which the hydrothermal condition was relatively suitable for vegetation growth. Ecosystems in southern Xinjiang of China and northwest Kazakhstan are fragile to climate change.

Redefining the link between rainfall and crop establishment in dryland cropping systems	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												Context: The seasonal break is a rainfall event that has traditionally initiated sowing and enabled plant establishment in Mediterranean-type environments. Despite its importance to crop production, neither the pattern of the seasonal break, nor the impact of recent autumn rainfall decline in eastern Australia on the pattern has been quantified at a national scale. Adaptive strategies to remove reliance on the seasonal break for crop establishment can include combinations of novel genotypes and innovative crop management. Objective: This paper (i) shows how seasonal changes may be altering the pattern of sowing opportunities across southern Australia, and (ii) evaluates the potential for adaptive management to deal with these changes using a case-study in southern Australia involving early, deep-sown wheat cultivars with long coleoptiles to reduce the dependence on the seasonal break for successful crop establishment. Methods: In the first part of the study, the timing of the seasonal break across the southern Australian cropping regions was determined using the sum of a 7-day rolling mean rainfall to evaporation ratio > 1 to trigger a sowing opportunity between 1 March and 30 July using long-term (1971?2018) gridded (0.05? ? 0.05?) historical climate data. The relationship between early-season climatic conditions and adaptive management options was then evaluated using a growth chamber experiment and a field experiment in a Mediterranean-type environment to evaluate the factors leading to successful establishment of earlier deeply sown wheat cultivars with long coleoptiles. Results and conclusions: The analysis revealed spatial and seasonal variability with the earliest median seasonal break (27-March) in New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria, and the latest (3-June) in Western Australia (WA). The largest shift in seasonal break was a 17-day advance in the Mallee and Sandplain of WA, and an 11-day delay in Central NSW during the period 1990?2018. Evaluation of the factors controlling establishment of a long coleoptile wheat cultivar suggested that soil temperatures in the early sowing windows were unlikely to reduce coleoptile length, but seeding depth, soil type and water availability will play an important role on emergence. Significance: In summary, the shifts in the climatic conditions at the break of the growing season have not been the same across the southern cropping region. Adaptations for this climatic shift such as long-coleoptile, deepsowing strategies for wheat show significant promise but careful consideration of soil factors is required to ensure success and to improve on-farm decision making regarding its use.

Phlebovirus diversity in ticks from livestock in arid ecologies in Kenya	TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES												Phleboviruses are emerging pathogens of public health importance. However, their association with ticks is poorly described, particularly in Africa. Here, adult ticks infesting cattle, goats and sheep were collected in two dryland pastoralist ecosystems of Kenya (Baringo and Kajiado counties) and were screened for infection with phleboviruses. Ticks mainly belonged to the species Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, Hyalomma impeltatum, and Hyalomma rufipes. A fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene was identified in thirty of 671 tick pools, of which twenty-nine were from livestock sampled in Baringo county. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that twenty-five sequences were falling in three clades within the group of tick-associated phleboviruses. The sequences of the three clades showed nucleotide distances 8%, 19% and 22%, respectively, to previously known viruses suggesting that these sequence fragments may belong to three distinct viruses. Viruses of the group of tick-associated phleboviruses have been found in several countries and continents but so far have not been associated with disease in humans or animals. In addition, five sequences were found to group with the sandflyassociated phleboviruses Bogoria virus, Perkerra virus and Ntepes virus recently detected in the same region. Further studies are needed to investigate the transmission and maintenance cycles of these viruses, as well as to assess their potential to infect vertebrates.

However, because direct observation of livestock behavior is time- and labor-intensive, an automated methodology to classify livestock behavior according to animal position and posture is necessary. We applied the Random Forest algorithm to predict livestock behaviors in the Horqin Sand Land by using Global Positioning System (GPS) and tri-axis accelerometer data and then confirmed the results through field observations. The overall accuracy of GPS models was 85% to 90% when the time interval was greater than 300-800 s, which was approximated to the tri-axis model (96%) and GPS-tri models (96%). In the GPS model, the linear backward or forward distance were the most important determinants of behavior classification, and nongrazing was less than 30% when livestock travelled more than 30-50 m over a 5-min interval. For the tri-axis accelerometer model, the anteroposterior acceleration (-3 m/s(2)) of neck movement was the most accurate determinant of livestock behavior classification. Using instantaneous acceleration of livestock body movement more precisely classified livestock behaviors than did GPS location-based distance metrics. When a tri-axis model is unavailable, GPS models will yield sufficiently reliable classification accuracy when an appropriate time interval is defined.

However, could this strategy improve yield or water use efficiency (WUE) and be sustainable without decreasing deep soil water in drought-prone environments is not clear. A 4-year of successive field study was carried out with three different drought and density stress tolerance maize hybrids and four plant density arrange from 52,500 to 97,500 plants ha(-1). To quantify the responses of grain yield formation and WUE to increasing plant density under various rainfall condition and evaluate the effect on deep soil water balance. Results showed that using of drought and density stress tolerance hybrids could achieve higher grain yield and WUE with higher plant density in normal years, which was associated with an increase in kernels number per square meter. But in dry year, as fewer water was available during reproductive growth stage in higher plant density, grain yield and WUE was gradually decreased with increasing plant density, especially in density stress sensitive hybrid. Soil water balance at 0 to 200 cm depth was not broken by high plant density from the perspective of same water availability at sowing in each year, despite of the lower soil water content during maize growth stage. However, high plant density tended to consume more deep soil water which was hardly been replenished by precipitation, especially in high density tolerance hybrids. Hence, higher density that exceed 60000 plants ha(-1) couple with drought and density stress tolerance hybrids is a potential way to improve maize production in dryland, but it increases the risk of deep soil desiccation.					hao, wang/IXN-0703-2023; wang, yu/IUQ-6654-2023; Wu, Yiping/JJF-6185-2023; dong, zhao/JHS-9392-2023	hao, wang/0000-0002-5109-7194; Wu, Yiping/0009-0000-6223-5786; 													0378-3774	1873-2283				AUG 20	2019	223								105655	10.1016/j.agwat.2019.05.039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.05.039													WOS:000495460400005

The decline of water resources and the increased use of N fertilizer as a result of climate change have made it even more challenging for farmers to produce winter wheat with high yields and efficiently use water and N for sustainable agriculture. To achieve sustainable agricultural development in dry land regions of China, we need to improve yields and efficient use of N fertilizer in winter wheat. The purpose of this study is to observe the changing trends of the N application rate during the variety replacement process on winter wheat yield and NUE. In this study, a 2-year field experiment was conducted with three N application rates (0, 120, and 240 kg hm(-2)) and eight commonly grown winter wheat cultivars cultivated in the dry land areas of Guanzhong plain since the 1950 s. Two indicators of fertilizer-based N partial factor productivity (PFP) and apparent N recovery efficiency (RE), and two indicators of plant-based N use efficiency (NUTE) and N harvest index (NHI) were selected to observe the synergistic relationship between N rates and NUTE of different varieties in 2 years. The results showed that plant N accumulation (PNA), N transfer amount (NTA), N transfer efficiency (NTE), and NHI were significantly positively correlated with grain yield (r > 0.8). Nitrogen application and cultivar replacement not only increased the amount of assimilated N in grains after anthesis, but also increased the redistribution into grains. The contribution of vegetative organs to grains before anthesis ranged from 54.8 to 74.9%, which was the reason for the high N absorption efficiency and NUTE. The latest winter wheat variety of 2020 (XN20) accumulated the highest N content in all organs at flowering and maturity stages, while the oldest genotype of 1950 (BM1) accumulated minimum. The N1 and N2 treatments showed a significantly greater yield than N0. In summary, N application had a positive impact on grain yield in winter wheat, while year-to-year variability was mainly attributed to changes in variety and meteorological factors. The release of N-efficient varieties with PNA, NTA, NTE, and NHI can be selected in breeding work to increase grain yield. Under N application, PFP and RE were significantly positively correlated with yield, suggesting that these two indicators can be used as basic crop management indicators to increase yield. This provides information on effective agricultural N management measures and wheat breeding practices in the dryland regions of China.

In each of the two years, Angus crossbred heifers (14 mo of age; year 1, N = 57, BW = 449 +/- 3.60 kg; year 2, N = 58, BW = 328 +/- 3.57 kg) were used in a 84-d completely randomized design evaluating the following treatments: 1) control, no supplement; 2) salt-limited supplement in pelleted form; and 3) a salt-limited supplement in loose form. Individual supplement intake, and time spent at the feeder were measured throughout the course of the study using a SmartFeed Pro self-feeder system (C-Lock Inc., Rapid City, SD, USA). On days 0, 42, and 84, the heifers were weighed, and body condition scored following a 16-h shrink. Supplementation and form of supplement did not influence (P >= 0.62) BW change for yearling heifers within or across study grazing periods. Body condition score was not influenced (P >= 0.26) by supplementation and form within the 0 to 42 (period 1) or 42 to 84 (period 2)-d periods but displayed a treatment by year interaction (P < 0.01) for the 84-d summer grazing period. Supplement intake (kg/d and g/kg BW) displayed a treatment x period interaction (P < 0.01). Supplement intake (kg/d) of heifers consuming pelleted supplement was 28% and 31% greater (P <= 0.02) than heifers consuming loose supplement in periods 1 and 2, respectively. Supplement intake (g/kg BW) of heifers consuming pelleted supplement was 24% and 32% greater (P <= 0.05) than heifers consuming loose supplement in periods 1 and 2, respectively. Overall, across both years, supplement intake in period 1 was less than half (P < 0.01) that of period 2, averaging 0.50 and 1.14 kg/day, respectively. Variation in supplement intake (% CV) was greater (P = 0.03) in period 1 compared to period 2, averaging 119% and 91%, respectively. In addition, variation in supplement intake was greater (P = 0.03) in year 2 than year 1, averaging 122% and 88%. Our results suggest that salt-limited supplements have a high degree of intake variation and pelleting could have a masking effect as indicated by the greater intake and intake rate of supplement with heifers consuming the pelleted supplement. Lay Summary Protein supplements are often utilized for cattle grazing extensive rangelands to increase forage intake during times of seasonal nutrient deficiencies. An ideal supplement program minimizes costs, maximizes animal performance, and utilizes supplements that reduce variation of animal intake. Numerous factors can impact supplement intake including delivery method, inclusion of salt and supplement forms (loose, finely ground, and pelleted). Our research evaluated the use of salt as an intake limiter and the supplement form (loose versus pelleted) on individual supplement intake of yearling heifers grazing low-quality forage. Overall, our research suggests salt-limited supplements have a high degree of intake variation. Additionally, pelleted supplement resulted in a higher intake and intake rate compared to loose supplement. Therefore, the physical form of supplement (loose versus pelleted) should be considered in precision supplementation strategies.

In particular, the unassisted establishment of nonvascular plants such as biological soil crusts or biocrust communities (e.g., soil lichens, mosses and cyanobacteria) in newly formed habitats is not yet fully understood. However, the potential of biocrusts to improve soil structure and function at the early stages of succession and promote ecosystem recovery is enormous. In this study, we evaluated the capacity of lichen biocrusts to spontaneously establish and develop on road slopes in a Mediterranean shrubland. We also compared taxonomic and functional diversity of biocrusts between road slopes and natural habitats in the surroundings. Biocrust richness and cover, species composition, and functional structure were measured in 17 road slopes (nine roadcuts and eight embankments) along a 13 km highway stretch. Topography, soil properties and vascular plant communities of road slopes were also characterized. We used Kruskal-Wallis tests and applied redundancy analysis (RDA) to test the effect of environmental scenario (road slopes vs. natural habitat) and other local factors on biocrust features. We found that biocrusts were common in road slopes after similar to 20 years of construction with no human assistance needed. However, species richness and cover were still lower than in natural remnants. Also, functional structure was quite similar between roadcuts (i.e., after soil excavation) and natural remnants, and topography and soil properties influenced species composition while environmental scenario type and vascular plant cover did not. These findings further support the idea of biocrusts as promising restoration tools in drylands and confirm the critical role of edaphic factors in biocrust establishment and development in land-use change scenarios.

However, the landmass has received less attention even if it has high ecological, environmental, and economic uses. The present study was conducted in Hirmi woodland vegetation, which is one of the dryland areas in Ethiopia, with the objective of investigating the floristic composition, plant community types, vegetation structure, community-environment relations and its regeneration status. Vegetation and environmental data were collected from 80 sampling plots with a size of 25 m x 25 m designated as the main plots. Diameter at breast height (DBH), height, basal area, density, vertical structure, importance value index (IVI), and frequency were computed. Species diversity and evenness were analyzed using Shannon diversity and evenness indices. The plant community types and vegetation-environment relationships were analyzed using classification and ordination tools, respectively. A total of 171 vascular plant species belonging to 135 genera and 56 families were recorded. About 5.3% of the species were endemic and near-endemic to Ethiopia. The highest number of species was recorded in families Fabaceae (16.4%) and Poaceae (11.7%) followed by Asteraceae (7.0%), Combretaceae, Lamiaceae, and Moraceae (3.5% each). Five plant communities were identified. According to the results from ordination analysis, the floristic composition of these plant communities was significantly affected by altitude, slope, sand, silt, soil organic matter, total nitrogen, and disturbance. The vegetation structure reveals that a large number of individual species was categorized in the lower DBH, frequency, and height classes. The highest Shannon diversity index and evenness values of the study area were 4.21 and 0.95, respectively.Anogeissus leiocarpa, Combretum hartmannianum, Ziziphus mucronata, Terminalia macroptera,andAcacia polyacanthawere the species with high IVI. Some endemic plants were in the IUCN red list categories of Ethiopia and Eritrea. The overall regeneration status of the study area was poor because of anthropogenic disturbances and grazing pressures. Although the study area is endowed with high plant species diversity including endemism, it is under poor regeneration status due to various disturbances. To overcome this challenge, integrated management measures including monitoring and application of restoration techniques by taking into consideration the significant environmental factors associated with species diversity as well as observed regeneration status and IUCN threat level of the species are highly recommended.

Temperate biocrusts: mesic counterparts to their better-known dryland cousins	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT												Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are known to serve crucial functions in many arid and semiarid habitats, but less is understood about biocrusts in temperate biomes, where they are often widespread and can play important roles in aboveground and belowground processes. Because the distinctive conditions that support biocrusts in temperate biomes - sandy, acidic, and/or nutrient-poor soils or exposed bedrock - frequently also support rare plant and animal communities, such sites can have considerable conservation value. We detail the distribution of biocrusts in temperate habitats, including many in the northeasternUS, where they have not previously been described. Besides adding another layer of biodiversity to the sites in which they occur, biocrusts may also play a critical role in site-level ecology and functioning. As such, integrating temperate biocrust composition, distribution, and functions into ecosystem management may contribute to the stability and resilience of the ecosystems in which they are found in the face of global climate change and other disturbances.

Incorporating the impacts of human-social aspects is thus imperative in examining ecological interactions. The provision of agricultural inputs in these resource-scarce regions supports invasive and pest species, negatively impacting both agricultural productivity and native desert ecosystems. Understanding the spatial dynamics of invasive and pest species requires analyzing both bottom-up resource availability factors underlying animal distributions and top-down biological controls. Here, we evaluate the social-ecological cascading effects of dryland agriculture on vertebrate pest communities in dryland agricultural communities of Israel. Our study region is characterized by 18 agricultural cooperatives with distinct crop regimes due to contrasting social decision-making and resource allocation schemes (i.e., communal kibbutzim vs. privatized moshavim). Crop choices further affect land management (e.g., enclosed vs. open farm systems) and resource intensity. This system is ideal for studying trophic mechanisms underlying animal assemblages between agricultural regimes. We examine the role of agricultural land-use practices on pest spatial distributions based on multiyear vertebrate pest observations with agricultural data sets. We use structural equation modeling (SEM) to quantify the relative importance of added agricultural resources underlying bottom-up and top-down trophic processes regulating vertebrate pest assemblages. Results reveal that crop choices determine pest distributions through bottom-up processes directly, while simultaneously driving pest competitive interactions through indirect top-down cascades impacting pest communities. For example, due to the indirect negative effect of wolves on mesopredators (foxes and jackals) mediated by livestock, the total positive effect of livestock on the abundance of mesopredators is reduced. Our study illustrates the social-ecological cascading effects of agricultural regimes on pest community assemblages mediated by contrasting agricultural land-use practices. Considering the expansion of dryland agroecological systems globally, understanding the intricate cascading pathways of predator- and prey-pest communities has important implications for agricultural management, biological invasions in drylands, and fragile desert environments.

However, the integrated effects of different ridge-furrow configurations on rainwater collection and crop performance are still lacking. Using a specialized database drawn from field experiments in the Loess Plateau, we examined the regional effects of three typical ridge-furrow configurations, namely high (>1:1), uniform (=1:1), and low (<1:1) ridge-furrow ratios, on soil water storage, crop water use efficiency (WUE), and grain yield. The high ridge-furrow ratio achieved the greatest improvements in soil water storage than the other two ratios. Compared with traditional flat planting without ridge-furrow configuration, crop yield and WUE were significantly increased by 37.65%, 27.12%, 31.70%, and 47.70%, 30.00%, and 17.80% under high, uniform, and low ridge-furrow ratios, respectively. Improvements in crop yield and WUE due to the different ridge-furrow configurations were jointly affected by climate, soil organic matter, and fertilizer application. The mean annual precipitation of 600 mm and the mean annual temperature of 12 degrees C can be used as the threshold for selecting the ratio of ridge-furrow. An increase in soil organic matter gradually declined the increase in grain yield and WUE owing to the three ridge-furrow ratios, such that the maximum effect was found for the high ridge-furrow ratio. Among the three ratios, the improvements in crop yield and WUE were most notable when the application rates of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer were 100-200 kg ha(-1) and 101-125 kg ha(-1), respectively. This study examined the scientific basis of a ridge-furrow farming practice for enhancing rainfall use and crop WUE; thus, these results offer novel insights for the optimized design of a ridge-furrow ratio in dryland agroecosystems of the Loess Plateau by taking into account site-based climatic conditions, soil fertility, and fertilization input level.

GENOTYPE BY ENVIRONMENT AND STABILITY ANALYSES OF DRYLAND MAIZE HYBRIDS	SABRAO JOURNAL OF BREEDING AND GENETICS												The phenotypic analysis of new candidate varieties at multiple locations could provide information on the stability of their genotypes. We evaluated the stability of 11 maize hybrid candidates in five districts in East Java Province, Indonesia. Maize hybrids with high yield potential and early maturity traits derived from a diallel cross were planted in a randomized complete block design with two checks (Srikandi Kuning and BISI-2) as a single factor with four replicates. The observed traits were grain yield per hectare and harvest age. The effects of environment, genotype, and genotype x environment interaction on yield were highly significant (P < 0.01). KTM-1, KTM-2, KTM-4, KTM-5, and KTM-6 showed higher average grain yield per hectare than the checks (Srikandi Kuning = 8.49 ton ha-1 and BISI-2 = 7.32 ton ha(-1)) at five different locations. The average harvest age of 11 candidates was less than 100 days. KTM-4 and KTM-5 had production yields that were higher than the average yield of all genotypes in all environments (Yi > 7.78 tons ha(-1)) and were considered stable on the basis of three stability parameters, i.e., FinlayWilkinson, Eberhart-Russell, and additive main effect multiplicative interaction (AMMI). KTM-2 had the highest yield among all tested genotypes (9.33 ton ha(-1)) and was considered as stable on the basis of AMMI but not on the basis of FinlayWilkinson and Eberhart-Russell. KTM-1 performed well only in Pamekasan, whereas KTM-6 performed well only in Sampang. Thus, these two genotypes could be targeted for these specific locations.					amzeri, achmad/AAW-3808-2021	amzeri, achmad/0000-0002-8521-5021													1029-7073	2224-8978				DEC	2020	52	4					355	368																WOS:000661376900001

This study examined the ability of optimized multi-endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) for monitoring desert vegetation degradation, recovery, and greening in a dryland basin of Northwest China using Landsat time series data from the 1990s to 2016. Eight modeled endmember fractions were generated using the best endmember model with the lowest fraction error and root mean square error (RMSE). Abundances of non-desert vegetation, desert vegetation, soil, and impervious surface areas were incorporated based on the eight original fractions and validated using high spatial resolution images. Finally, the post-classification comparison approach was used to detect desert vegetation degradation, recovery, and greening. Results show that: (1) More than 97% of the land pixels were modeled successfully into eight endmember fractions for each period with the mean RMSE less than 0.01. All four simulated abundances had high correlations (r = 0.89-0.96) with the corresponding reference data, indicating good performance of MESMA in this study; (2) Desert vegetation increased dramatically (772.68 km(2)) during the 26-year period. The major change was desert vegetation recovery with a total area of 10,705 km(2), followed by degradation with a total area of 4,715 km(2). The greening area was the smallest, covering only 1,509 km(2); (3) Increased precipitation was the major contributor for desert vegetation greening in the west of upper region while decreased precipitation was the major contributor for the degradation in the west of lower region. Anthropogenic factors (e.g., improvement of irrigation, crop expansion) were major contributors for the change in desert vegetation in the middle region. This research demonstrates that MESMA is promising in detecting desert vegetation dynamics in semi-arid and arid regions.

The economiceenvironmental trade-off of growing apple trees in the drylands of China: A conceptual framework for sustainable intensification	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Agricultural intensification has turned the drylands-dominated Loess Plateau (LOP) of China into the world's largest apple production area, which has greatly contributed to increasing farmer's income and reducing rural poverty in the past two decades. However, substantial environmental trade-offs are evident, including (i) severe deep soil desiccation, which lowers resistance to extreme droughts; (ii) low soil organic carbon sequestration, which undermines apple tree's ability to mitigate climate change; (iii) high soil erodibility, which increases the risks for orchards suffering serious erosion; and (iv) severe residual nitrate pollution, which threatens drinking water and planetary health. We propose a concep-tual framework for addressing those environmental externalities, which will incorporate a nexus of scientists and technicians, policymakers, social enterprises, and smallholder farmers (SPES) to emphasize good governance, green-production technologies (GPTs), and collaboration as the route toward sus-tainable intensification and the realization of SDG 1 (alleviation of rural poverty), SDG 6 (reduction of soil and water pollution), SDG 13 (provision of important carbon sinks), and SDG 15 (positive water cycling and soil and water conservation).

Here we use 30-year observed streamflow data (1991-2020) and numerical models to assess the impacts of climate variability and climate change on the Macquarie Marshes (the Marshes), a large floodplain wetland complex in the semi-arid region of New South Wales, Australia. A fast ecohydrologic emulator based on network linear programming with side constraints was developed to simulate the spatial and temporal responses of different wetland vegetation types to water regime. The emulator represents the wetland by a series of inter-connected level-pool reservoirs with the volume-discharge relationship obtained from a calibrated quasi-2d hydrodynamic model. The emulator reproduces daily flows and volume with good accuracy (Nash-Sutcliffe statistic ranging from 0.61 to 0.96) with 1/26,000 of the computational effort. We use the emulator to simulate the potential effects of climatic variability on vegetation by running the model over 30 years of observed data and 1000 statistically representative 30-year streamflow time series, which were generated using a stochastic model calibrated to the gauged flows. The collection of results for all 1000 contemporary simulations indicates the Marshes experience severe conditions 43% (+/- 18%) of the time in a 30year period. We then ran an additional 6000 simulations to assess the combined impacts of climate variability and future climate change at the end of the century. For the driest future climates (-60% and -30% reduction in runoff), the Marshes remain in severe condition 89% (+/- 6%) and 63% (+/- 16%) of the time, respectively, while no major differences with respect to the contemporary conditions were found for the wetter future. Our results highlight the importance of quantifying the extent and uncertainty in the degradation of these ecosystems due to climate variability and change for informing management decisions.

Remotely Sensed Spatial Structure as an Indicator of Internal Changes of Vegetation Communities in Desert Landscapes	REMOTE SENSING												Desert environments are sensitive to disturbances, and their functions and processes can take many years to recover. Detecting early signs of disturbance is critical, but developing such a capability for expansive remote desert regions is challenging. Using a variogram and 15-cm resolution Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI) imagery, we examined the usefulness of the spatial structure of desert lands for monitoring early signs of habitat changes using the Riverside East solar energy zone located within Riverside County, California. We tested the method on four habitat types in the region, Parkinsonia florida-Olneya tesota, Chorizanthe rigida-Geraea canescens, Larrea tridentata-Ambrosia dumosa, and Larrea tridentata-Encelia farinosa alliances. The results showed that the sill, range, form, and partial sill of the variogram generated from VARI strongly correlate with overall vegetation cover, average canopy size, canopy size variation, and spatial structure within a dryland habitat, respectively. Establishing a baseline of variogram parameters for each habitat and comparing to subsequent monitoring parameters would be most effective for detecting internal changes because values of variogram parameters would not match absolute values of landscape properties. When monitoring habitats across varying landscape characteristics, a single appropriate image resolution would likely be the resolution that could adequately characterize the habitat dominated by the smallest vegetation. For the variogram generated from VARI, which correlates to vegetation greenness, the sills may indicate the health of vegetation communities. However, further studies are warranted to determine the effectiveness of variograms for monitoring habitat health. Remotely sensed landscape structure obtained from variograms could provide complementary information to traditional methods for monitoring internal changes in dryland vegetation communities.

Biocrusts increase the resistance to warming-induced increases in topsoil P pools	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. Ongoing global warming and alterations in rainfall patterns driven by climate change are known to have large impacts on biogeochemical cycles, particularly on drylands. In addition, the global increase in atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition can destabilize primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems, and phosphorus (P) may become the most limiting nutrient in many terrestrial ecosystems. However, the impacts of climate change on soil P pools in drylands remain poorly understood. Furthermore, it is unknown whether biocrusts, a major biotic component of drylands worldwide, modulate such impacts. 2. Here we used two long-term (8-10 years) experiments conducted in Central (Aranjuez) and SE (Sorbas) Spain to test how a similar to 2.5 degrees C warming, a similar to 30% rainfall reduction and biocrust cover affected topsoil (0-1 cm) P pools (non-occluded P, organic P, calcium bound P, occluded P and total P). 3. Warming significantly increased most P pools-except occluded P-in Aranjuez, whereas only augmented non-occluded P in Sorbas. The rainfall reduction treatment had no effect on the soil P pools at any experimental site. Biocrusts increased most soil P pools and conferred resistance to simulated warming for major P pools at both sites, and to rainfall reduction for non-occluded and occluded P in Aranjuez. 4. Synthesis. Our findings provide novel insights on the responses of soil P pools to warming and rainfall reduction, and highlight the importance of biocrusts as modulators of these responses in dryland ecosystems. Our results suggest that the observed negative impacts of warming on dryland biocrust communities will decrease their capacity to buffer changes in topsoil P driven by climate change.

It is a great challenge to accurately estimate the woody aboveground biomass (AGB) of a sparse mixed forest with heterogeneous woody vegetation types and background types. In this study, a novel woody AGB estimation methodology (VI-AGB model stratified based on herbaceous vegetation coverage) using a combination of Landsat-8, GaoFen-2, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images was developed. The results show the following: (1) the woody and herbaceous canopy can be accurately identified using the object-based support vector machine (SVM) classification method based on UAV red-green-blue (RGB) images, with an average overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 93.44% and 0.91, respectively; (2) compared with the estimation uncertainties of the woody coverage-AGB models without considering the woody vegetation types (RMSE = 14.98 t center dot ha(-1) and rRMSE = 96.31%), the woody coverage-AGB models stratified based on five woody species (RMSE = 5.82 t center dot ha(-1) and rRMSE = 37.46%) were 61.1% lower; (3) of the six VIs used in this study, the near-infrared reflectance of pure vegetation (NIRv)-AGB model performed best (RMSE = 7.91 t center dot ha(-1) and rRMSE = 50.89%), but its performance was still seriously affected by the heterogeneity of the green herbaceous coverage. The normalized difference moisture index (NDMI)-AGB model was the least sensitive to the background. The stratification-based VI-AGB models considering the herbaceous vegetation coverage derived from GaoFen-2 and UAV images can significantly improve the accuracy of the woody AGB estimated using only Landsat VIs, with the RMSE and rRMSE of 6.6 t center dot ha(-1) and 42.43% for the stratification-based NIRv-AGB models. High spatial resolution information derived from UAV and satellite images has a great potential for improving the woody AGB estimated using only Landsat images in sparsely vegetated areas. This study presents a practical method of estimating woody AGB in sparse mixed forest in dryland areas.					liu, lingling/IUQ-7478-2023; Liu, Liangyun/D-9891-2016; shi, yonglei/JHT-8182-2023; Wang, Zhihui/ABD-5203-2021	Liu, Liangyun/0000-0002-7987-037X; Wang, Zhihui/0000-0002-4984-1623; Wang, Zhihui/0000-0001-8836-7111														2072-4292				DEC	2021	13	23							4859	10.3390/rs13234859	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13234859													WOS:000735051000001
J	Prince, SD; Podwojewski, P				Prince, Stephen D.; Podwojewski, Pascal			Desertification: Inappropriate images lead to inappropriate actions	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Among policy institutions, researchers in other fields, and the public, there is an enduring misunderstanding of the nature of desertification. To a considerable extent, its meaning has been reduced to just two eye-catching images: sand dunes encroaching on productive land and habitations and bare, cracked soil surfaces. Yet neither of these is an indicator of desertification-sometimes called dryland degradation. Rather desertification results in a wide range of changes, including erosion, loss of biodiversity, decline in soil fertility, and reduced carbon storage. Surprisingly, it is the pictures themselves, not the scientific literature, that have fixed this erroneous concept in the minds of even some who work in the field of land degradation. The results of this confusion include inappropriate management efforts, mistaken premises in research, and ill-informed policies at local to global scales including misleading prognostications of institutions-even at the level of United Nations agencies.

Remote sensing tools have tremendous potential for improving NUE in crops through efficient nitrogen management as well as the identification of high-NUE genotypes. The objectives of this study were (i) to identify and quantify the variation in NUE across 24 winter wheat genotypes (Triticum aestivumL.) and (ii) to determine if the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) could characterize the variability in NUE across wheat genotypes. This study was conducted in 2010 and 2011 in the semi-arid climate of Northeastern Colorado across dryland and irrigated conditions. Our results indicate significant variation in the NUE among genotypes across two irrigation conditions. We observed a strong relationship between the NDVI and NUE-as PFP (partial factor productivity) and PNB (partial nitrogen balance)-across the 24 wheat genotypes under dryland conditions (average R(2)for PFP and PNB = 0.84) at Feekes growth stage 11.1, for site year II. However, poor association was observed under irrigated conditions (average R(2)for PFP and PNB = 0.29) at Feekes growth stage 3 to 4 for site year II. This study demonstrates the potential and limitations of active canopy sensing to successfully characterize the variability in NUE across wheat genotypes.

However, the assembly of plant-associated microbiomes and the effect of the introduction of plants on soil and plant-associated microbiomes remain unclear. In this study, we investigated shrub-associated microbes from five ecological microhabitats, including the leaves, litter, roots, rhizosphere, and root zone, across four xeric shrub plantations (Artemisia ordosica, Caragana korshinskii, Hedy-sarum mongolicum, and Salix psammophila), using 16S and internal transcribed spacer2 rRNA gene sequencing. We found that the changes in the bacterial and fungal communities were more influenced by the microhabitats than by the plant species, with distinct niche differentiation. Microbial source tracking and nestedness analysis showed that the shrub-associated bacteria primarily originated from the bulk soils and were slightly selected in the different microhabitats; this similar pattern was not observed in the shrub-associated fungi. Furthermore, the surrounding zone of roots was a hot spot for microbial recruitment in revegetated shrubs. Null model analysis indicated that the deterministic and stochastic process dominated the assembly of bacterial and fungal com-munities, respectively. Our findings suggest that ecological microhabitats of revegetated shrublands strongly influence the bacterial and fungal compositions of the plant microbiome. This study enhances our understanding of the mechanism underlying the plant-soil microbiome feedback during the initial plant-establishment period in dryland ecosystems. Furthermore, our insights can assist in the development of effective strategies for estab-lishing and managing vegetation sustainably in drylands.

It is challenging to obtain both high and stable crop yield in drylands. Soil water storage and consumption are crucial affecting crop yield in drylands. However, the relationship between yield and the degree of subsoil water consumption is still unclear. To clarify the contribution of subsoil water on yield performance under different conditions of WS (water supply during the growing season), we analyzed the relationship between grain yield of winter wheat and SWC1-2 (1-2 m subsoil water consumption) under different WS conditions, from published studies on a typical dryland habitat (Loess Plateau of China). The results showed that increasing SWC1-2 during late growth stage had a great potential to increase wheat yield. Moreover, the probability of low wheat yield decreased as more subsoil water was used. When the residual subsoil water storage reduced from (270-210) to (150-90) mm at harvest time, the probability of yield falling below 4000 kg ha-1 was decreased from 100 % to 48.01 % under < 666 mm WS conditions; and the probability of exceeding 5000 kg ha-1 was greatly increased from 0.55 % to 99.59 % under > 666 mm WS conditions. In addition, SWC1-2 was significantly increased with increasing number of spikes or shoot biomass, which suggests that it is necessary to ensure a sufficient plant population for higher consumption of subsoil water. Our study indicates that wheat yield can be greatly enhanced by using more subsoil water under high WS conditions, and the probability of low wheat yield can be decreased with increasing subsoil water consumption under low WS conditions.																			1161-0301	1873-7331				SEP	2022	139								126558	10.1016/j.eja.2022.126558	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2022.126558		JUN 2022											WOS:000817822400003

The present study aimed to reveal the new characteristics of low-temperature cold damage to maize in the context of climate warming. Heilongjiang, one of the provinces with the highest latitude, the most significant climate change and the largest maize production in China, was taken as the study area. We combined meteorological stations and MODIS remote sensing data to spatially identify the occurrence and intensity of cold damage to maize based on the growing season temperature distance level index, as well as to assess the extent of cold damage. RESULTSThe main findings are: (i) The frequency and intensity range of cold damage in the growing season (May to September) in Heilongjiang Province from 1991 to 2020 against climate warming showed a decreasing trend. The average temperature from 1991 to 2000 was 17.777 degrees C, with seven occurrences of maize cold damage years, of which 5 years comprised widespread cold damage and 2 years comprised regional cold damage. The average temperature from 2000 to 2010 was 18.137 degrees C, with cold damage three times, of which 2 years comprised regional cold damage and 1 year comprised widespread cold damage. The average temperature from 2010 to 2020 was 18.130 degrees C, with one maize cold damage year occurring, which comprised regional cold damage. The frequency of maize chilling injury decreased significantly from 1991 to 2020, from 0.23 in 1991-2000 to 0.1 in 2000-2010 and, finally, to 0.03 in 2010-2020. (ii) The good consistency between MODIS_LST data and temperature data from meteorological stations suggests that MODIS_LST data can be used to build a temperature remote sensing estimation model for spatially extensive cold damage monitoring and intensity discrimination. (iii) Taking 2009 as an example of a large-scale cold damage year, the spatial discrimination of maize cold damage intensity shows that the spatial distribution of chilling injury intensity has no obvious geographical features. The intensity of cold damage was mainly mild cold damage. According to administrative regions, the scope of chilling injury was the largest in Mudanjiang City, Heihe City, and Jixi City, accounting for 91.56%, 86.25%, and 84.91%, respectively. The areas with the most extensive range of severe chilling injuries were the Great Khingan Mountains region, Heihe City, Mudanjiang City, Yichun City, and Jixi City. CONCLUSIONIn the context of climate warming, the frequency and intensity range of maize cold damage showed a decreasing trend from 1991 to 2020 in Heilongjiang Province. The results of cold damage identification based on MODIS_LST data are accurate and can improve the spatial accuracy. The results of the present study provide a reference and guidance for dealing with the occurrence and defence of spatially refined cold damage.

Development and validation of soil test based fertilizer prescription equations for enhancing yield, uptake and nutrient use efficiency of foxtail millet (<i>Setaria italica</i>) under dryland condition	JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION												Balanced crop nutrition will be rewarding to profitable sustainable yield and soil quality.To develop and validate fertilizer prescription equation for foxtail millet under dryland farming situation by encompassing the Soil Test Crop Response approach (STCR), field experiments were conducted at Eastern Dry Zone of Karnataka, University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore from Kharif 2017 to 2020 in four phases. Soil test data, grain yield, and NPK uptake by foxtail millet crop were used for achieving four important basic parameters, viz., Nutrient requirement, contribution of nutrients from fertilizers (%CF), soil (%CS), and organic manure (%C-OM) to develop the targeted yield equation and these equations were in comparison with Low-Medium-High (LMH) approach and general recommended dose (GRD). It was found that 4.30, 3.13, and 3.61 kg of N, P2O5, and K2O, respectively were required for producing one quintal of foxtail millet grain under inorganic approach whereas 4.20, 2.87, and 4.19 kg of N, P2O5, and K2O, respectively, under integrated approach. The STCR approach, with or without FYM, at the target yields 13 and 10 q ha(-1) enhanced the grain yield over general recommended dose and approach. It also exhibited a higher NPK uptake and use efficiency, along with better profitability. Frontline demonstrations were conducted at Tumakuru district, Karnataka, and grain yield under the STCR approach was increased to the extent of 77.94% compared to farmer's practice. STCR-targeted yield approach could improve the yield, economics, and efficiency of nutrient use for foxtail millet compared to GRD and LMH approach.																			0190-4167	1532-4087				AUG 9	2023	46	13					3082	3100		10.1080/01904167.2023.2188065	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2023.2188065		MAR 2023											WOS:000950961800001

Given its climate-sensitivity it forms a serious environmental hazard, and to cope with this challenge during current global warming it needs to be better understood. The Bajestan Playa in the strongly salinization-affected Iranian drylands hosts several protected areas and forms an important regional dust source. Hence, soil salinization in this region affects local and regional ecosystems and societies, but was not systematically studied yet. Using an unprecedented comprehensive approach we systematically monitored regional soil salinity 1992-2021 using remote sensing as well as on-site field and laboratory measurements, and linked these with regional and global climatic data to understand (i) the spatio-temporal soil salinity dynamics, (ii) the impact of regional and global climate changes, and (iii) the potential of our approach for further soil salinity studies. Our annual time resolution over three decades provided significantly deeper and unprecedented insights into soil salinization: Both regional annual precipitation and temperature control soil salinity, but the latter responds to precipitation with time lags of up to two years and to higher temperatures without any time lag. This probably reflects the transport time of leached soluble salts from their sources following humid years. No systematic soil salinity changes were observed within the playa basin, but outside the basin soil salinity systematically increased. Whereas regional precipitation did not show a systematic trend during the last decades, regional temperature increased and was mostly correlated with the increasing GLOTI, POL and TSA climatic indices. Hence, given ongoing global warming a further increase of regional soil salinization should be expected, with serious consequences for saline dust emissions, the regional protected areas and climate-related migrations. Altogether, our multi-disciplinary pioneer study demonstrates a high future application potential also for other salinity-affected drylands, forming a base to deal with the consequences of ongoing global climate change.

Assessing impact of dry spells on the principal rainfed crops in major dryland regions of India	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												The dry spells and rainfall deficit within crop season, play vital role in determining productivity of rainfed crops. Dry Spell Index (DSI) was formulated to quantify cumulative impact of dry spells during kharif season (Jun-Sep) on major rainfed crops of India. District-wise variability of DSI were analyzed across rainfed regions of India using rainfall data of 1636 stations. Comparison of DSI with Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), hitherto, a widely used drought index showed that, central and eastern Karnataka, northern Rajasthan and western Gujarat are becoming wetter in terms of total seasonal rainfall as indicated by SPI, and becoming drier in terms of total dry spell duration within the season as per DSI. The impact of DSI on yield of major rainfed crops viz., cotton, groundnut, maize, pearl millet, pigeon pea and sorghum were estimated. The analysis showed that, the impact of dry spells integrated in form of the DSI on yields of six major rainfed crops was higher in comparison to total rainfall indicated by SPI for six major rainfed crops in India. Groundnut and pearl millet crops experienced higher duration of dry spells in comparison to other crops. The productivity of all the crops was significantly influenced by DSI across more than 65% growing regions. The yield loss was about 75-99% in 24% of sorghum, 23% of groundnut and 13% of pearl millet and it was about 50-74% in 44% of cotton, 24% of groundnut, 17% of maize, 16% each of pearl millet & sorghum and 12% of pigeon pea growing regions. We also found that by minimizing the cumulative impact of dry spells, yield can be increased twice in more than 55%, 49% and 42% areas of pearl millet, pigeon pea and groundnut growing regions, respectively. This study will help developing adaptation strategies to sustain crop production in rainfed regions of India.

Annette; Ekwaro-Osire, Stephen			Long-Term Drought Trends in Ethiopia with Implications for Dryland Agriculture	WATER												Intraseason and seasonal drought trends in Ethiopia were studied using a suite of drought indicators-standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) and Z-index for Meher (long-rainy), Bega (dry), and Belg (short-rainy) seasons-to identify drought-causing mechanisms. Trend analysis indicated shifts in late-season Meher precipitation into Bega in the southwest and southcentral portions of Ethiopia. Droughts during Bega (October-January) are largely temperature controlled. Short-term temperature-controlled hydrologic processes exacerbate rainfall deficits during Belg (February-May) and highlight the importance of temperature- and hydrology-induced soil dryness on production of short-season crops such as tef. Droughts during Meher (June-September) are largely driven by precipitation declines arising from the narrowing of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). Increased dryness during Meher has severe consequences on the production of corn and sorghum. PDSI is an aggressive indicator of seasonal droughts suggesting the low natural resilience to combat the effects of slow-acting, moisture-depleting hydrologic processes. The lack of irrigation systems in the nation limits the ability to combat droughts and improve agricultural resilience. There is an urgent need to monitor soil moisture (a key agro-hydrologic variable) to better quantify the impacts of meteorological droughts on agricultural systems in Ethiopia.

M.; Domingos, Tiago			Comparative Analysis of Pasture Soil Fertility in Semiarid Agro-Silvo-Pastoral Systems	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Dryland pastures are usually on soils with a low fertility. However, a high spatial variability is apparent in pasture soils. In consequence, the application of inputs should be based on the particular characteristics of each field and their within-field variability. In this study, a comparative analysis of seven experimental fields (agro-silvo-pastoral ecosystems) in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula was performed using a probabilistic and objective model. Some soil properties (the texture, cation exchange capacity, soil apparent electrical conductivity, organic matter, nitrogen, potassium and slope) measured at six sampling locations in each field were consolidated in the model. It was verified that the data fit the model and, later, a ranking of all the sampling locations and, consequently, a ranking of all the experimental fields according to the pasture soil fertility was established. Moreover, another output of the model was a ranking of the soil properties according to their influence on the soil fertility: the topographical property, the slope, was the most influential as it is related to the level of other important soil properties, as the textural components. Two fields, Cubillos and Grous, had the highest overall soil fertility levels because the soil samples in these fields were very fertile. However, some samples in the other five fields were also in the group of the most fertile, denoting the existence of an important spatial variability within each field. The proposed method is a rational way to improve the efficiency of the use of fertilisers by adjusting them to the soil pasture fertility.

J	Dingaan, MNV; Tsubo, M				Dingaan, Mamokete N., V; Tsubo, Mitsuru			Improved assessment of pasture availability in semi-arid grassland of South Africa	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Satellite remote sensing technology has been successfully used to monitor grassland productivity, especially for estimating the green component of biomass using popular indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The non-green component, which includes senescent and dead standing material, has not been widely quantified. Our study aimed at devising a satellite remote sensing-based method that can distinguish between green and non-green herbage, in order to improve the accuracy of total aboveground biomass (TBM) estimations. This in turn can minimise under-estimations of pasture availability in semi-arid grasslands. MODIS satellite data was used to determine the relations of various indices to ground-measured green aboveground biomass (GBM) and non-green aboveground biomass (NBM) in South African semi-arid grasslands. We found a strong correlation of GBM to NDVI. We were then able to detect a correlation of NBM to Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), but a robust relationship was between NDWI and the ratio of NBM to TBM. NDVI and NDWI were used to estimate long-term TBM, which varies inter- and intra-seasonally. During the non-rainy season, NBM is important to maintain livestock grazing and in this regard monitoring of pasture availability in terms of green and non-green herbage is critical for sustainable grassland management.

Palustrine limestones and calcretes as the sedimentary record of paleoenvironmental changes in a Late Permian semi-arid climate at the SE periphery of the Southern Permian Basin (the Holy Cross Mountains, Poland)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												An important part of the Upper Permian (Zechstein) sequence in the Holy Cross Mountains (HCM) in Poland comprises continental carbonate facies where dryland and wetland depositional environments dominated the southeastern part of the Southern Permian Basin. Sedimentological and thin-section microfacies analysis of over 860 m of core from seven wells, supplemented with field observations from several outcrops from the HCM area, has allowed recognition of numerous siliciclastic and mixed silici-carbonate facies which are related to alluvial fan, proximal and distal floodplains, and ephemeral lacustrine environments. Due to climatic seasonality and subsequent groundwater oscillations, the latter were frequently exposed, causing widespread desiccation cracking and pedogenesis. Continuous aggradation controlled by steady tectonic subsidence allowed the deposition and preservation of thick (> 30 m) units with numerous palustrine intervals. In such a low aggradation rate system, vertical and lateral changes in the continental facies associations reflect the climatic evolution from arid to semi-arid and then to sub-humid environments with enhanced climatic seasonality. These facies changes indicate a gradual increase in the water availability towards the Permian-Triassic boundary, which may support the hypothesis of generally increased wetting at the low-latitudes of Pangea, linked with the development of greenhouse conditions and enhancement of the intertropical convergence zone at that time. Continental carbonates are therefore recognised as high-resolution recorders of palaeoclimate and tectonics.

However, early vigour is a genetically complex trait, and results from field experiments have been highly variable. Whether early vigour can lead to improved water use efficiency and crop yields is strongly dependent on climate and management conditions across the entire growing season. Here, we present a modelling framework for simulating the impact of early vigour on wheat growth and yield at eight sites representing the major climate types in Australia. On a typical soil with plant available water capacity (PAWC) of 147 mm, simulated yield increase with early vigour associated with larger seed size was on average 4% higher compared with normal vigour wheat. Early vigour through selection of doubled early leaf sizes could increase yield by 16%. Increase in yield was mainly from increase in biomass and grain number, and was reduced at sites with seasonal rainfall plus initial soil water < 300 mm. Opportunities exists for development of early vigour wheat varieties for wetter sites. Soil PAWC could play a significant role in delivering the benefit of early vigour and would require particular attention.

Therefore, a field study was conducted during 2016-2017 at the Research field of AICRP for Dryland Agriculture Akola, Maharashtra (India), on an ongoing long-term experiment initiated in 1987-1988 under cotton + greengram (1:1) intercropping system to find out how different nutrient management practices affect the soil quality (SQ) and cotton + greengram productivity. The eight treatments comprised of sole use of organics and chemical fertilizers, integration of organics with chemical fertilizers (INM) to partially substitute nitrogen, and a control treatment. The results after 30th cycle revealed that the partial substitution of N through FYM/gliricidia increased cotton and greengram yield over control. These treatments caused significant improvement in the soil physical and biological properties and also improved the soil fertility status, mainly soil organic carbon (OC) by 53%, available N (AN) by 25%, available P (AP) by 50%, and available K (AK) by 25% over control. The SQ assessment through principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that, in this semi-arid subtropical region, HC, OC, and CO2 evolution can be viewed as important indicators of SQ for cotton + greengram intercropping system. Therefore, we concluded that, INM practice that encourages balanced fertilization must include FYM/gliricidia as part of the nutrient application package in this region to improve soil quality and sustain productivity of cotton + greengram intercropping system.

Habitat associations of dryland avian communities during an extended dry period	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												The influence of resource availability on ecosystem function varies spatially and temporally, among and within ecosystems. Dramatic shifts in moisture-driven resources can drive bottom-up effects on animal behaviours and distributions. Further, complexity arises when landscapes are influenced by large mammalian grazers and predator-induced trophic cascades, such as those mediated by the dingo (Canis familiaris (Dingo)) in the eastern arid Strzelecki Desert in Australia. During the driest two-year period on record for this region, we investigated the persistence of avian communities associated with structurally distinct dunes and swale habitats, and across two different land management regimes (pastoral land with livestock and dingoes, and Sturt National Park managed for conservation without these animals). We grouped all birds into dietary functional groups to infer patterns of habitat use associated with available resources. We also compared incidental observations of the 'winter' bird community in part of the study region between the extended dry period of 2018/2019 and wet period of 2020/2021. Despite habitat partitioning, the avian community did not differ between land management regimes except in species richness during the dry period, likely driven by the low numbers of birds present during the surveys. Incidental observations indicated that insectivorous and omnivorous species dominated the bird community in the dry period, with granivorous species forming a greater proportion of the bird community during wet times. Birds with completely or partially insectivorous diets dominated avian species composition on surveys in the dry period, but there were distinct structural vegetation associations among functional groups, indicating that heterogeneity in vegetation structure was likely important for the conservation of refuges, which enable the persistence of avifauna during extended dry periods. Distinct habitat type, structure and available resources shaped avian communities in this landscape, during the extremely resource-limited extended dry period, with implications for conservation and management, particularly given the increasing drying effects of climate change.

Sustainability strategies and soil fertility in the dryland Binh Thuan, Vietnam	SPANISH JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Land degradation caused by both human impact and climatic factors leads to desertification and results in a reduction of the vegetation cover, erosion and a loss of soil fertility followed by socioeconomic problems. In particular, non-adjusted land use practices are the main driving forces for desertification. The present study examines how sustainability strategies under dragon fruit and peanut cultivation in Binh Thuan, Vietnam, influence soil fertility in a region that is characterised by Arenosols and a semi-arid climate. The coastal area is prone to desertification which complicates agricultural production. For that purpose, soil analyses for various soil parameters were combined with a socio-scientific survey based on the evaluation of quantitative interviews and a SWOT analysis. The results indicate that no significant effects of sustainability strategies on soil fertility could be measured. Furthermore, no evidence was found that intercropping enhances soil fertility, since soil parameters were not higher under dragon fruit intercropped with peanut than under monoculture. A higher nutrient concentration directly next to the dragon fruit shows that dragon fruit cultivation contributes more to soil fertility than peanut cultivation. This is especially because of the application of mulch around the plant which increases the humus content in soil and keeps the nutrients from leaching. However, the non-cultivated area in between the dragon fruit is more exposed to soil erosion. Differences in values next to and in between the plants are higher under dragon fruit. Therefore, it can be assumed that under peanut, nutrient concentrations are more balanced over the whole field. Due to a rising demand for food and pressure on land not yet used for agriculture, further research on Arenosols and the implementation of agricultural practices adapted to environmental conditions should be accelerated in order to achieve the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals).																			2253-6574						2019	9	2					71	87		10.3232/SJSS.2019.V9.N2.02	http://dx.doi.org/10.3232/SJSS.2019.V9.N2.02													WOS:000475502100002

This study aimed to characterize soil microbial genes and their potential to mediate SOC decomposition in three revegetation shrublands (Artemisia ordosica, Salix psammophila and Caragana microphylla) in the Mu Us Desert of northern China using an SOC mineralization experiment and shotgun metagenome sequencing. Among the three shrublands, the S. psammophila shrubland had the highest cumulative CO2 emissions and highest rates of mineralization of the slow SOC pool. The mineralization rate of the slow SOC pool and the microbial taxonomic and functional composition displayed a significant correlation. Most C-degradation genes were assigned to three bacterial phyla, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria. The relative abundance of microbial functional genes involved in degrading recalcitrant C-complexes was significantly higher in the S. psammophila shrubland, resulting in the slow accumulation of recalcitrant SOC. These results suggest that the microbial functional genes that regulate the decomposition of the SOC pool in dryland shrubland soils may be influenced by shrub species selection. These findings highlight the importance of understanding how microbial catabolic potential mediates the potential for SOC sequestration in different revegetation shrublands in drylands. Highlights We studied SOC mineralization and soil microbial functional genes in three revegetation shrublands. S. psammophila shrubland had the highest CO2 emissions and highest mineralization rates of the slow C pool. Slow SOC pool mineralization rate was related to microbial taxonomic and functional composition. Different dryland shrubs may mediate soil microbial functional genes that regulate SOC pool decomposition.

Temporal variations in plant and soil characteristics following strip-till manure application	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Utilizing manure as a cost-effective plant nutrient source under dryland farming is often undermined by transportation and application costs of large quantities of manure. Reducing application quantities by applying manure only to the strip-till (ST) zone also may help reduce possible eutrophication and nitrate contamination of ground and surface water. A 3-yr study conducted at New Mexico State University's Agricultural Science Center at Tucumcari, NM USA, compared the effectiveness of a one-time application of manure in the ST zone using dryland sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) as the test crop in four randomized complete blocks each year. Treatments were an ST control and manure rates [11 (Low (L)) and 22 (High (H)) Mg ha(-1)] in combination with application techniques [surface (S) and 15 cm incorporation by ST (I)]. Significant treatment X year interactions existed (P <= 0.05) for sorghum biomass yield, tissue N and P, water-use efficiency (WUE) and the majority of residual soil characteristics with the H + I treatment consistently having greater results compared to the other treatments every year. The WUE for control, L + S, L + I, H + S, and H + I were 8.9, 9.9, 10.3, 11.7, and 13.9 kg ha(-1) mm(-1), respectively, three years after the single manure application (P < am, SEM = 0.674). Despite having the higher biomass yield and tissue N and P concentrations, H + I continued to show high residual soil N and P, even three years after the single manure application. Consequently, significant agricultural benefits from a one-time application of manure continued to be evident beyond a three-year period. Due to predominant semiarid dryland conditions, the N and P runoff losses were not evident in this study.

This transition poses several challenges, and it is necessary to understand the changes in crop productivity and soil health for the design of viable cropping systems. Our objective was to compare the impact of irrigation retirement on crop production and soil microbial dynamics under the two major crops of the semiarid High Plains. In a formerly irrigated field, we installed a transition experiment that consisted of two irrigation managements, irrigated and non-irrigated (retired), under two cropping systems: continuous maize and continuous winter wheat. Lower soil moisture after irrigation retirement decreased plant biomass production in both crops, with a higher effect on maize (2 to 6-fold decrease) than on wheat (20% less aboveground biomass production). In both crops, irrigation retirement affected crop development in the order grain yield > aboveground biomass > belowground biomass. Soil microbial communities were less affected by irrigation retirement than the evaluated crops and changes were concentrated in the maize agroecosystem. After three seasons, the high decrease in maize productivity and soil moisture resulted in 50% less extracellular enzyme activity in the dryland treatment, but without consistent effects on microbial biomass or community composition assessed by phospholipid fatty acids. Winter wheat appears as a viable option not only to sustain crop production but also to minimize the negative impacts of irrigation retirement on soil health. However, root production was lower in wheat than in maize, which may affect the long-term evolution of soil organic carbon.

Moench]-fallow (W-GS-FL) crop rotation with annual forages can increase productivity and resource use efficiency. The objective of this research was to quantify the impact of increasing crop intensity by growing forages in a traditional W-GS-FL rotation on cropping system productivity, water use, precipitation use efficiency, and net income. The study was conducted at the Southwest Research-Extension Center near Garden City, Kansas, from 2013 through 2020. Winter wheat (W), grain sorghum (GS), forage sorghum (FS), and forage oats (FO, Avena sativa L.) were used to generate six crop rotation treatments. These rotation treatments interspersed with fallow periods (FL) were W-GS-FL, W-FS-FL, W/FS-GS-FO, W/FS-FS-FO, W/FS-GS-FL, and W/FS-FS-FL. A W/FS indicates winter wheat double crop FS planted in the same year. The yield of FS was 45%-56% more with W/FS-FS-FO and W/FS-FS-FL compared with W-FS-FL. Available soil water at GS planting was 23%-30% less, and GS yield was 52%-60% smaller with W/FS-GS-FL compared to W-GS-FL. Water productivity and pre-season soil water storage were greatest with W/FS-FS-FL and W/FS-FS-FO. Inclusion of W/FS increased cost of production compared with W-GS(FS)-FL rotations. Gross return was greatest with W/FS- FS-FO and W/FS-FS-FL. The W/FS-FS-FO increased cropping intensity, productivity, resource use, and gross margin relative to other rotations in the semi-arid Great Plains. Producers should consider double-cropping of FS after wheat harvest, followed by a second year of FS in dryland cropping systems if there is sufficient forage demand.

Here we investigated the uncertainty and dynamics of gross primary productivity (GPP) by distinguishing the contributions of soil microbial primary producers and plants to CO2 fixation during four sequential growing seasons in a fragile dry grassland on the Tibetan Plateau. The results demonstrated that soil microbial GPP consistently accounted for a high proportion of plant GPP (18.2%), and both exhibited similar seasonal patterns during the four-year observation. Soil microbial GPP demonstrated a much greater interannual variation (76.1%) than plant GPP (15.1%), indicating that the interannual GPP uncertainty could be largely from microbial primary producers. Regression analysis indicated that plant GPP had higher sensitivity (demonstrated by slope) than soil microbial GPP to both soil water content and temperature. The GPP ratio of soil microbes to plants also demonstrated a clear seasonal change, and peaked in July in the four-year observation, with a minimum interannual variation (6.8%). The GPP ratio enhanced with increasing soil water content (P < 0.001), but did not correlate with soil temperature. Our findings suggest the great potential of soil microbial GPP, and challenge the plant-oriented models of terrestrial C estimation, which account for plant GPP but ignore soil microbial GPP. Thus, a more robust framework needs to incorporate both soil microbial and plant GPPs for accurately assessing C balance. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Turner, S; Norbury, G				Turner, Samantha; Norbury, Grant			Population responses of common lizards inside a predator-free dryland sanctuary	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Predator-free sanctuaries can assist the conservation of multiple endemic species, but quantitative evidence of these benefits is often lacking, especially for herpetofauna. We measured population responses of three common lizard species (schist geckos, Woodworthia 'Central Otago'; McCann's skinks, Oligosoma maccanni; and southern grass skinks, O. aff. polychroma Clade 5) 1 year before and 5 years after mammalian predators were removed inside a mammal-proof fence in a dry grass/shrubland habitat with abundant schist rock in Central Otago, New Zealand. Gecko counts in 25 artificial retreats (ARs) along replicated, 250-m long transects inside the fence increased from 5.2 to 17.7 per transect, compared with 3.3 to 5.4 per transect outside the fence where predators were present. This indicates a doubling of counts inside the fence when changes outside the fence are accounted for. The number of skinks seen along these transects increased from 1.3 to 2.3 per transect without predators, compared with 0.6 to 0.4 with predators. Lizard tracking tunnel indices (recorded only after predators were removed) were significantly higher without predators (62% geckos, 42% skinks) than where predators were present (12% geckos, 2% skinks). Tail loss in geckos was significantly higher where predators were present (24%) than where they were absent (1%). These data suggest that common lizard species are being suppressed to a significant degree by mammalian predators and demonstrate the potential for their recovery where predators are removed.																			0110-6465	1177-7788					2023	47	1							3544	10.20417/nzjecol.47.3544	http://dx.doi.org/10.20417/nzjecol.47.3544													WOS:001089484500002

Local contextual factors are a prerequisite for effective policy development and optimisation of water resources management for smallholder sheep production. Two-hundred and fifty-two structured questionnaires were administered to investigate the contextual factors that influence smallholder farmers' perceived impact of water scarcity on sheep production in the dry ecozones of the Cape provinces in South Africa and identify their local response strategies. Logit regression findings showed that a unit increase in private commercially-oriented arid farms, males, education level, flock size, adapted breeds and income from livestock increased farmers' probability to perceive impact of water scarcity on sheep production. Regardless of ecozone and farm types, sheep farmers switched between water sources, provided supplementary feed and shade, used adapted breeds and alternative markets to manage the impact of water scarcity. Interventions to build resilience to water scarcity in the surveyed areas should target sheep farmers with low adaptive capacity, particularly less educated women relying on livestock income and farming with non-adapted breeds on subsistence-oriented communal farms in the semiarid ecozone.

J	Li, SL; Bowker, MA; Xiao, B				Li, Shenglong; Bowker, Matthew A.; Xiao, Bo			Biocrust impacts on dryland soil water balance: A path toward the whole picture	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												As a crucial living feature inhabiting the soil-atmosphere boundary, biocrusts play a vital role in liquid water or vapor transport through surface soil and thus have strong effects on soil water regimes. However, it remains unclear how biocrusts affect annual or multiyear soil water budgets through the regulation of evaporation outputs and non-rainfall water (NRW) or infiltration inputs. Thus, we used automated microlysimeters to continually investigate the differences in evaporation and NRW rates between moss-dominated biocrusts and bare soil at 0-5 cm depth for 2 years. The upper 30 cm of soil moisture (theta) and water storage (W) of bare soil and biocrusts were also monitored. Our results showed that the daily evaporation rate (E) of biocrusts was 17% higher than bare soil. Especially after rainfall events, biocrusts had higher E and larger cumulative evaporation than bare soil. Besides, the daily NRW of biocrusts averaged 15% higher than bare soil over 2 years. Furthermore, biocrusts increased theta by 11%-76% at 0-10 cm depth but decreased theta by 32%-56% at 20-30 cm depth in comparison to bare soil, and they subsequently decreased W by 20% at 0-30 cm depth. Summarized annually, the NRW amount of biocrusts was 19% higher than bare soil, but at the same time, the cumulative evaporation of biocrusts was also 19% higher than bare soil. Finally, biocrusts resulted in more water loss at shallow depth through evaporation and lessened total W throughout 0-30 cm depth of soil. These findings demonstrate that although biocrusts input more NRW into surface soil, these water inputs partially offset their intensified evaporation. Given that all rainfall water infiltrates into the soil in our study system, our findings indicate that biocrusts may have an overall negative effect on soil water balance there, while at the same time increasing water storage and availability of the deeper soil underlying biocrusts.

Although distinct biocrust types contain different dominant photoautotrophs, few studies to date have documented carbon exchange over time from various biocrust types. This is especially true for gypsum soils. Our objective was to assess the carbon exchange of biocrust types established at the world's largest gypsum dune field at White Sands National Park. MethodsWe sampled five different biocrust types from a sand sheet location in three different years and seasons (summer 2020, fall 2021, and winter 2022) for carbon exchange measurements in controlled lab conditions. Biocrusts were rehydrated to full saturation and light incubated for 30 min, 2, 6, 12, 24, and 36 h. Samples were then subject to a 12-point light regime with a LI-6400XT photosynthesis system to determine carbon exchange. ResultsBiocrust carbon exchange values differed by biocrust type, by incubation time since wetting, and by date of field sampling. Lichens and mosses had higher gross and net carbon fixation rates than dark and light cyanobacterial crusts. High respiration rates were found after 0.5 h and 2 h incubation times as communities recovered from desiccation, leveling off after 6 h incubation. Net carbon fixation of all types increased with longer incubation time, primarily as a result of decreasing respiration, which suggests rapid recovery of biocrust photosynthesis across types. However, net carbon fixation rates varied from year to year, likely as a product of time since the last rain event and environmental conditions preceding collection, with moss crusts being most sensitive to environmental stress at our study sites. DiscussionGiven the complexity of patterns discovered in our study, it is especially important to consider a multitude of factors when comparing biocrust carbon exchange rates across studies. Understanding the dynamics of biocrust carbon fixation in distinct crust types will enable greater precision of carbon cycling models and improved forecasting of impacts of global climate change on dryland carbon cycling and ecosystem functioning.

Seeking Common Ground in Dryland Systems: Steps Towards Adaptive Water Governance	WATER												Drylands are exposed to climate stressors, such as water scarcity, as well as societal stressors, including conflicts, which can make water governance unsuitable for the system's context. The emergence of adaptive water governance often takes places in these challenging contexts, but the process of achieving this style of governance requires a better consideration of system complexities. Using the Rio del Carmen watershed in Mexico as a case study, with primary data obtained through a questionnaire survey carried out with 217 farmers, this paper aims to identify the main complexities and needs to enable the emergence of adaptive water governance. We found that different groups of farmers converge in identifying system stressors and the main needs regarding water governance; yet, the ways these stressors are perceived differ between groups. The results indicate that contrasting perceptions are shaped by the different cultural roots and environmental conditions in the upper and lower parts of the watershed. This variation increases the difficulty in achieving collaboration and compromise when conflicts ensue. Reducing inequalities in the awareness of system stressors has the potential to enable adaptive water governance. This could be achieved through a peacebuilding technique with an appropriate cultural approach for the watershed's context in the early stages of a stakeholder engagement process.

We consider a two-component reaction-diffusion-advection model of Klausmeier type describing the interplay of vegetation and water resources and the resulting dynamics of these patterns. We focus on the large advection limit on constantly sloped terrain, in which the diffusion of water is neglected in favor of advection of water downslope. Planar vegetation pattern solutions are shown to satisfy an associated singularly perturbed traveling wave equation, and we construct a variety of traveling stripe and front solutions using methods of geometric singular perturbation theory. In contrast to prior studies of similar models, we show that the resulting patterns are spectrally stable to perturbations in two spatial dimensions using exponential dichotomies and Lin's method. We also discuss implications for the appearance of curved stripe patterns on slopes in the absence of terrain curvature.

Hydrologic Connectivity and Patch-To-Hillslope Scale Relations in Dryland Ecosystems	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												In drylands, runoff during storms redistributes water and nutrients from bare soil areas to vegetated patches, subsidizing vegetation with additional resources. The extent of this redistribution depends on the interplay between surface roughness and permeability; greater permeability in vegetated patches promotes run-on to vegetation, but greater surface roughness diverts runoff, producing tortuous flow paths that bypass vegetation. Here, this interplay is examined in virtual experiments using the 2D Saint Venant Equations to measure runoff connectivity. Flowpaths are delineated using tracers advected by the flow. Distances between tracer sources and sinks along flowpaths measure hydrologic connectivity at two lengthscales: connectivity to the hillslope outlet and within-slope source-sink connectivity. Differences between these connectivity lengthscales indicate how flow may "by-pass" vegetated patches within hillslopes. At the hillslope scale, a derived power-law relation between the runoff coefficient and outlet connectivity describes hillslope water losses, providing a foundation for identifying landscapes likely to shed water.

The characteristics of the multiple relationships between ecosystem functional traits affected the vulnerability to drought. A three-level network analysis on instead of the network metrics, relationships among inter-components, and essential traits was conducted in dryland ecosystems of China. The new network of functional traits included leaf, root, and biomass components was constructed to simulate different aridity conditions. Results show that the multiple relationships of functional traits that co-regulated ecosystem biomass differ along an aridity gradient. The highest network modularity and degree centrality were observed in the semiarid ecosystems indicating low integration and high sensitivity of semi-arid ecosystems (269% and 23.7% higher than in dry sub-humid site, and 142% and 51.1% higher than arid sites). The leaf quantity strongly affected the connection between functional traits at the semi-arid zone. The semi-arid areawas found to have relatively low resistance to environmental change because of low integration and high sensitivity of the ecosystem structure at that site. An increase of degree centrality of the root traits and trade-off relationships between roots and leaves indicated greater allocation of resources by vecgetation to underground components by the arid ecosystems to increase water absorption. The study reveals the complex relationships between leaf, root, and biomass components, and the essential traits of the ecosystem. It enhanced understanding of the vulnerability of semi-arid ecosystems to environmental change.

J	Wijas, BJ; Finlayson, G; Letnic, M				Wijas, Baptiste J.; Finlayson, Graeme; Letnic, Mike			Herbivores' Impacts Cascade Through the Brown Food Web in a Dryland	ECOSYSTEMS												Food webs can be conceptualized as being powered by energy derived from living and dead vegetation, respectively. Most food web research has focused on "green food webs " which begin with the consumption of living vegetation by herbivores. However, "brown food webs " which stem from the consumption of senescent vegetation by detritivores are also an important channel of energy transfer. In theory, herbivores have the potential to disrupt brown food webs by consuming plant material before it can senesce and become available for detritivores. Here we investigate the effects that grazing by kangaroos, whose population had irrupted partly due to the absence of an apex predator, has on the brown food web in an arid environment. We compared the cover of living and dead vegetation, the abundances of detritivorous termites and their predators inside one ha herbivore exclosures and nearby control plots. Results show there was more cover of living and dead vegetation inside the exclosures. Similarly, abundances of termites and small vertebrate predators of termites were greater inside the exclosures. Our study provides evidence that consumption of plant material by irruptive herbivores can disrupt the functioning of the brown food web by reducing the flow of energy from plant biomass to termites which in turn translates to reduced abundances of termites and small vertebrates that feed on termites. Our findings have implications for conservation and management because they shed light on a previously unconsidered threat to the functioning of arid ecosystems, disruption of brown food webs by irruptive herbivores.

Our study included various critical thematic layers such as precipitation, temperature, slope, land-use/land-cover (LULC), soil texture, soil depth, and length of growing period, prepared and modeled on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Using expert knowledge, scores were assigned to these thematic layers, and a priority map was prepared based on the combined weighted average score. We also validated priority watersheds. For this, the study area was classified into three priority zones ranging from 'high' to 'low'. Of the 277 watersheds identified, 57 fell in the high priority category, implying that they are highly favorable for interventions. This would be useful for regional-scale water resource planning for agricultural landscape development.

Formation of localized states in dryland vegetation: Bifurcation structure and stability	PHYSICAL REVIEW E												We study theoretically the emergence of localized states of vegetation close to the onset of desertification. These states are formed through the locking of vegetation fronts, connecting a uniform vegetation state with a bare soil state, which occurs nearby the Maxwell point of the system. To study these structures we consider a universal model of vegetation dynamics in drylands, which has been obtained as the normal form for different vegetation models. Close to the Maxwell point localized gaps and spots of vegetation exist and undergo collapsed snaking. The presence of gaps strongly suggest that the ecosystem may undergo a recovering process. In contrast, the presence of spots may indicate that the ecosystem is close to desertification.

Soil water repellency after slurry fertilization in a dryland agricultural system	CATENA												In the context of the circular economy, the use of animal excrements as fertilizers is encouraged, but the addition of such organic materials can develop soil water repellency (SWR) or hydrophobicity. There is a lack of consensus about how to assess SWR in agricultural soils. This work evaluated SWR when pig slurries were applied onto soil using the two most common testing methods: the water drop penetration time (WDPT) and the molarity of ethanol droplet (MED) tests. The experiment consisted of five different slurry treatments plus a control (no slurry added). At sowing, slurry from fattening pigs (SF) or no slurry application was combined with a second application at the cereal tillering stage, in which SF, slurry from sows (SS) or no-slurry were the treatments. Soil water repellency was tested at cereal tillering before slurry application and then during the following 47 days. At each sampling date, hydrophobicity was tested in undisturbed samples at field-moist and after 25 degrees C, 65 degrees C, and 105 degrees C oven drying. Disturbed samples were tested after 40 degrees C oven drying. Soil disturbance removed SWR. Under field conditions, undisturbed samples attained the maximum SWR expression 7d from pig slurry application; moderate and very severe scores using WDPT and MED were respectively attained. From 14d to the end of the experiment, the highest SWR was observed after 105 degrees C oven drying and when SF applications at sowing (900 kg TOC ha(-1)) had been combined with SS applications at cereal tillering (1894 kg TOC ha(-1)). Slurry hydrophobic compounds rather than slurry dry matter influenced SWR expression which is enhanced as the soil dries. The persistence of repellency (WDPT test) was more sensitive to detecting changes in SWR between treatments than the changes in its severity (MED test). The importance of the SWR described hereafter slurry application will depend on plant cover over the soil and the effects in slaking prevention in order to avoid superficial water runoff.

This study was conducted in the Changwu tableland, a representative area for agricultural crop cultivation in the Loess Plateau of China. Fifteen soil profiles, including grassland, farmland, and young, mature, and old apple orchards, were sampled to investigate the effects of different land uses on soil water and nitrate dynamics using a "space-for-time" substitution approach. The results showed that the soil water content and nitrate content in farmlands were comparable to those in wild grassland. However, significant differences in soil water were observed below a depth of 2 m in apple orchards, with mature and old orchards experiencing water deficits compared to grassland of 624.9 mm and 690.0 mm, respectively. Moreover, a dried soil layer formed below a depth of 5 m in these orchards. In terms of soil nitrate, the concentration in the 0-5 m depth of apple orchards was significantly higher than that in agricultural land and grassland, and it increased with the age of the orchards. However, below 5 m, the residual nitrate stock per unit depth in apple orchards decreased to levels comparable to grassland and farmland, primarily due to the inhibitory effect of the dried soil layer on downward migration and leaching processes. Furthermore, the relationship between nitrate and soil water at 0-5 m soil depths differed during the conversion from grassland to farmland and apple orchard, with positive and negative correlations observed, respectively. This indicates that water plays a key role in influencing nitrate movement, and distinct hydrological processes occur for soil water and nitrate nitrogen under different land use change conditions. In conclusion, converting grassland and farmland to apple orchards can lead to soil water decline and nitrate accumulation in the vadose zone, posing potential threats to ecosystem sustainability and security in dryland regions. Therefore, implementing appropriate water-fertilizer management practices is crucial for promoting sustainable land use in loess drylands, with potential implications for similar areas worldwide.

A chronological database assessing the late Quaternary palaeoenvironmental record from fluvial sediments in southwestern Africa	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Fluvial sediments preserve evidence of past hydroclimatic regimes and are important but potentially under-utilised indicators of palaeoenvironmental change in drylands. This paper presents a new chronological data-base of 603 ages from late Quaternary fluvial sediments at 70 sites in southern Africa's western dryland regions. This synthesis assesses the spatial and temporal trends in both the palaeoenvironmental record and the sup-porting data that underpins these interpretations. We find that topographic and climatic characteristics of river catchments influence the nature of fluvial archive formation and preservation. Channel confinement, legacies of research, and sampling strategies in specific river basins are found to control the sedimentary context and length of documented record available for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. The age of dated deposits and associ-ated magnitude of chronological uncertainties influence the temporal range and resolution of climate and fluvial variability that can be discerned. Where calendar year uncertainties are small enough, predominantly dating to the last millennium, individual flood events and multi-year episodes within flash flood deposits can be linked to synoptic climate patterns, yet when uncertainties are larger, interpretations are restricted to understanding multidecadal to centennial-scale phases of flow regimes. This paper collates a scattered literature to detail the current state of southwestern Africa's fluvial record and highlights opportunities for future research. We consider controls on fluvial archive interpretation that are pertinent to wider dryland contexts and argue that fluvial records provide useful information for inclusion in regional palaeoenvironmental syntheses. Following a filtering process, quality-assessed chronologies are compiled to establish the combined fluvial history of 22 rivers to consider the response of fluvial systems to hydroclimatic drivers. At the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 24-18 ka), records detail a regionally consistent signal of intermittent to perennial flow under relatively humid conditions in what are currently ephemeral systems. The mid Holocene (MH; 8-4 ka) is also characterised by the occurrence of sustained river flow and higher discharge events than present, but with greater spatial variability. Sedimentary archives display evidence of both intermittent flow and extreme flood events within ephemeral regimes, and two rivers, the Hoanib and Molopo, are characterised by reduced fluvial activity. Within the last millennium, flash flood regimes within an arid to hyper-arid climate were established with coherence in the timing of flood frequency variations recorded between catchments.																			0012-8252	1872-6828				JAN	2023	236								104288	10.1016/j.earscirev.2022.104288	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2022.104288		DEC 2022											WOS:000903374500002

Based on multiple satellite datasets from 2001 to 2020 and in-situ measurements, we investigated the effects of intensified precipitation on global drylands GPP under diverse annual total precipitation along the bioclimate gradient. Dry, normal, and wet years were identified as years with annual precipitation anomalies below, within, and above the range of one standard deviation. Intensified precipitation led to increases or decreases of GPP during dry or normal years, respectively. However, such effects were largely weakened during wet years. The responses of GPP to intensified precipitation were mirrored by soil water availability, as intensified precipitation enhanced root zone soil moisture, and thus vegetation transpiration and precipitation use efficiency during dry years. During wet years, root zone soil moisture showed less response to changed precipitation intensity. Land cover types and soil texture regulated the magnitude of the effects along the bioclimate gradient. Under intensified precipitation, shrubland and grassland distributed in drier region with coarse soil texture showed greater increases of GPP during dry years. As global precipitation will likely further intensify, the impacts of intensified precipitation on dryland carbon uptake capacity will be highly diverse along the bioclimate gradients.

FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS												The current paradigm of agricultural research and extension in support of rural development in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is to disseminate improved technologies designed to increase the generally low crop yields per hectare on individual farms. Using data from a baseline survey (n = 7,539) from a large rural development programme implemented in five countries in SSA, we calculate the increases in yield per hectare required to significantly contribute to poverty alleviation for households managing such farms. We estimate the gap between current crop productivity and the productivity required to reach a poverty line of $1.90 per capita per day adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). We find this gap to be very large, both in percentage and absolute terms. Median additional gross crop productivity required to reach this poverty threshold was: $324/ha/year (254% increase) in Mali; $1,359/ha/year (1,157% increase) in Niger; $4,989/ha/year (665% increase) in Ethiopia; $1,742/ha/year (818% increase) in Burkina Faso; $2,893/ha/year (1,297% increase) in Kenya. The required additional productivity taking account of production costs including the opportunity cost of family labor would need to be even higher. Given that (a) values of net productivity of improved rainfed crop technologies reported in the literature rarely exceed $1,000/ha/year; and (b) the majority of arable farms in SSA are two hectares or less with increasing trends toward land fragmentation, we argue that closing the yield gap among smallholder farmers in SSA will never-alone-be sufficient to meaningfully alleviate the high levels of poverty and deprivation many currently experience.																				2571-581X				DEC 10	2021	5								723301	10.3389/fsufs.2021.723301	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2021.723301													WOS:000743572800001

Esten			Does agroecosystem management mitigate historic climate impacts on dryland winter wheat yields?	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Global studies that quantify climate effects on crop yields using top-down spatial frameworks are invaluable for assessing generalized effects on world food supplies, yet do not contain the resolution necessary to identify local mediating effects of management. Our objectives were to identify (a) what climate factors have historically affected winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields in eastern Colorado, (b) how management may mitigate climate impacts, and (c) the potential for varietal selection to climate extremes. We paired long-term yield data for wheat in rotations that varied in management (tillage intensity, with and without fallow) with robust on-site weather data. We also used data from colocated variety trials to investigate trade-offs between mean yields and the ability to withstand water and temperature stress. Precipitation in April-June was nearly as predictive of yields as full growing season precipitation. While precipitation and air temperatures are tightly linked in this agroecosystem, temperatures were more predictive of yields than precipitation. Increases in minimum May temperatures positively affected yields, likely because of minimizing freeze damage, but did not offset detrimental effects of warmer daytime spring and summer temperatures. The largest negative temperature effects were caused by extreme maximum temperatures in June. No-till with fallow maximized yields. Lowand high-yielding varieties did not differ in yield responses to high temperatures, suggesting that future advancements in heat stress resistance will not necessarily require yield trade-offs. Climate pressures will likely require producers to balance yield goals with maintaining soil cover, underscoring the difficulty of identifying win-win climate adaptations.

J	Caviedes-Voullieme, D; Hinz, C				Caviedes-Voullieme, Daniel; Hinz, Christoph			From nonequilibrium initial conditions to steady dryland vegetation patterns: How trajectories matter	ECOHYDROLOGY												The multiscale nature of ecohydrological processes and feedbacks implies that vegetation patterns arising in water-limited systems are directly linked to water redistribution processes occurring at much shorter timescales than vegetation growth. This in turn suggests that the initially available water in the system can play a role in determining the trajectory of the system, together with the well-known role of the rainfall gradient. This work explores the role of initial hydrological conditions on vegetation dynamics and vegetation patterns. To do so, the HilleRisLambers-Rietkerk model was solved with different rainfall amounts and a large range of initial hydrological conditions spanning from near-equilibrium to far-from-equilibrium conditions. The resulting vegetation patterns and ecohydrological signatures were quantitatively studied. The results show that not only do initial hydrological conditions play a role in the ecohydrological dynamics but also they can play a dominating one even resulting in divergent vegetation patterns that exhibit convergent mean-field properties, including a new set of hybrid patterns. Our results highlight the relevance of assessing both global ecological and hydrological signatures and quantitatively assessing patterns to describe and understand system dynamics and in particular to determine if the systems are transient or steady. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the trajectories the system follows during its transient stages cannot be neglected to understand complex dependencies of the long-term steady state to environmental factors and drivers.

However, its actual climatic benefits are uncertain because the forests' reduced albedo can produce large warming effects. Using high-resolution spatial analysis of global drylands, we found 448 million hectares suitable for afforestation. This area's carbon sequestration potential until 2100 is 32.3 billion tons of carbon (Gt C), but 22.6 Gt C of that is required to balance albedo effects. The net carbon equivalent would offset similar to 1% of projected medium-emissions and business-as-usual scenarios over the same period. Focusing forestation only on areas with net cooling effects would use half the area and double the emissions offset. Although such smart forestation is clearly important, its limited climatic benefits reinforce the need to reduce emissions rapidly.					; Carmel, Yohay/G-4362-2011	Yakir, Dan/0000-0003-3381-1398; Carmel, Yohay/0000-0002-5883-0184													0036-8075	1095-9203				SEP 23	2022	377	6613					1436	1439		10.1126/science.abm9684	http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.abm9684								36137038					WOS:000887934300039

The aim of this paper is to assess the spatial variability and impact of riparian vegetation on reservoir evaporation by remote sensing. Eight reservoirs located in subhumid and semi-arid climates in the Brazilian Drylands were studied. Scenes from Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellites (1985 and 2018) supplied the data for four evaporation models. For reference evaporation, the Class A Pan and Piche Evaporimeter closest to the reservoirs were considered. The occurrence/density of riparian vegetation was associated with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and its influence on evaporation was assessed. The Surface Energy Balance System for Water (AquaSEBS) model presented the best average performance (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient 0.40 +/- 0.19). Evaporation was observed to be higher at the reservoirs' margins and near the dams, due to the contact of exposed soil and rock/concrete, respectively, which transfer heat to the water. Marginal areas near the riparian forest presented low evaporation rates with decreases between 18% and 31% in relation to the average. This interdependence was evidenced by the high negative correlation (R2 0.87-0.96) between NDVI and evaporation; vegetation reduces radiation because of the shading of the reservoir margin and changes local aerodynamics, reducing evaporation. Depending on the spatial variability of evaporation, it was found that the volumes transferred to the atmosphere may have variations of up to 30%. On average, the evaporated volume in all the studied reservoirs is 450,000 m3/day, a quantity enough to supply more than two million people. Overall, the results of this study contribute not only to a better understanding of the spa-tial variability of evaporation in surface reservoirs, but also of the interdependence between riparian vegetation and evaporation rates.

We conducted 2 experiments to investigate the effects of replacing oat hay by leguminous forages (alfalfa hay [AH] in experiment [Exp] 1 and common vetch hay [CVH] in Exp 2) with 4 levels (0%, 8%, 16% or 24% AH and 0%, 10%, 20% or 30% CVH on dry matter [DM] basis) at the same crude protein (135 g/kg DM) and metabolizable energy (10.1 MJ/kg DM) on feed intake, N metabolism, NUE and blood composition of crossbred Simmental calves. Sixteen calves of each Exp were assigned to the four diets in a randomized block design. Faecal N (FN) output and the ratio of FN to NI increased with increasing AH/CVH proportions, whereas urinary N (UN) output, the ratio of UN to NI, and the ruminal ammonia N concentration gradually decreased in both experiments. Nutrient digestibility (DM, organic matter [OM] and neutral detergent fibre [NDF]) of calves showed a parabolic trend with gradually increasing AH/CVH proportions. The highest values of nutrient digestibility (DM, OM and NDF) of calves were observed in 16% AH in Exp 1 and 20% CVH in Exp 2. Our findings suggest that 16% and 20% substitution (as a percentage of the total DM allowance) of AH and CVH, respectively, for oat hay are optimal diets to improve NUE and reduce the potential impact of N excretion from livestock farming on the environment through shifting routes of N from urine to faeces without negative effects on live weight gain and nutrient digestibility of crossbred Simmental calves in dryland environments.

In north-western Ethiopia, a field experiment was conducted to assess the effects of farmyard manure (FYM) and Desmodium intortum intercropping on the morphological characteristics, dry matter yield, and crude protein yield of Napier and desho grass, as well as their effects on soil physicochemical properties. The experiment was carried out in three replications using randomized complete block design with factorial arrangements at the Aba Gerima and Guder watersheds, which represent midland and highland agro-ecologies, respectively. The treatments used were Napier or desho grass alone [control], Napier or desho with Desmodium, Napier or desho with FYM, and Napier or desho combined with Desmodium and FYM. The results showed that fertilizer treatments had positive influence on morphological characteristics in both watersheds. The dry matter yield and crude protein yield were higher (p < 0.001) with FYM as well as FYM combined with Desmodium (9.1 to 9.6 t ha(-1) and 866.7 to 792.4 kg ha(-1)) at Aba Gerima and (7.0 to 7.1 t ha(-1) and 795.3 to 510.5 kg ha(-1)) at Guder, respectively. The fertilizer treatments, that is, FYM and combined use of FYM and Desmodium groups, showed soil organic carbon (18.4% and 20.5%) and available phosphorous (16.3% and 23.0%) content increments over the control at the Aba Gerima watershed. The findings suggested that applying FYM and combining FYM and Desmodium improved forage grass growth and yield by maintaining soil health in the dryland areas of Ethiopia's Upper Blue Nile basin.

For sustaining date palm production in these areas, organic fertilizers are applied, either spread on the soil surface (in Chenini) or buried under a sand layer (in Guettaya). We examined at a molecular level how these management techniques affect soil organic matter composition in oasis systems. A dominance of fresh plant input for Guettaya was indicated by solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy signals, which was most pronounced in the uppermost soil close to palms. Evidence for more degraded organic matter was found in deeper soil near the palms, as well as in the soil distant from the palms. Amino sugar contents were low in the uppermost Guettaya soil near the palms. The overall microbial amino sugar residue contents were similar in range as those found in other dryland environments. With increasing distance from trees, the amino sugar contents declined in Guettaya, where the palms grow on bare soil, but this was not the case for Chenini, which has multi-layer vegetation cover under palms. In agreement with the results from previous dryland studies, the soil microbial community in both oasis systems was dominated by fungi in topsoil, and a shift toward bacteria-derived residues in subsurface soil. This might be due to higher variability of temperature and moisture in topsoil and/or lower degradability of fungal remains; however, further research is required to confirm this hypothesis.

To achieve this goal, an hyperbolic extension of the classical parabolic Klausmeier model of vegetation, generally used to predict the formation of banded vegetation along the slopes of semiarid environments, has been here considered together with an additional advective term mimicking the downslope motion of seeds. Linear stability analyses have been carried out to inspect the dependence of the wave instability locus on the model parameters, with particular emphasis on the role played by inertial time and seed advection speed. Moreover, periodic travelling wave solutions are taken into account to better characterize modulus and direction of the migration speed of striped vegetation patterns. Theoretical predictions are corroborated by numerical Investigations and ecological implications are also discussed. In particular, it is highlighted how the hyperbolic nature of the model may provide possible justifications about some controversial field observations.

J	Smiley, RW				Smiley, Richard W.			Root-Lesion Nematodes Affecting Dryland Cereals in the Semiarid Pacific Northwest USA	PLANT DISEASE												Root-lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus spp.) are parasites that invade and deteriorate roots, thereby reducing the efficiency of water and nutrient uptake. Pratylenchus neglectus and P. thornei are the two species that are most prevalent and cause reduced yields of rainfed wheat and barley in semiarid regions of the Pacific Northwest. They are particularly damaging where wheat and barley are produced without irrigation in areas receiving less than 450 mm (18 in.) of precipitation annually. This review is focused on the biology and management of P. neglectus and P. thornei in semiarid rainfed agriculture. Characteristics of climates, soils, and crop production systems are described as a preface to constraints placed upon management options. Discussions include the economic importance, host ranges, and protocols for sampling and species identification. Discussion of disease management options include crop rotation, genetic resistance and tolerance, planting date, trap and biofumigant crops, crop nutrition, chemical and biological nematicides, and tillage. Predictions for rainfed agriculture in a period of changing climate are presented, as are suggestions for important areas of research including crop genetics, nematode testing, and communication of results, Pratylenchus biology, mechanisms of resistance, the phytobiome, and closing the "yield gap" between actual and attainable yields.

Data for each monitoring plot includes basic climatic and landscape features, photographs, 500 point intercepts for vegetation cover, plant species list and biodiversity indexes, 50-m line-intercept transect for vegetation spatial pattern analysis, land function indexes drawn from 11 measures of soil surface characteristics and laboratory soil analysis (pH, conductivity, organic matter, N and texture). Monitoring plots were installed between 2007 and 2019, and are being reassessed at 5-year intervals (247 have been surveyed twice). The MARAS dataset provides a baseline from which to evaluate the impacts of climate change and changes in land use intensity in Patagonian ecosystems, which collectively constitute one of the worlds largest rangeland areas.

J	Wijas, BJ; Cornwell, WK; Letnic, M				Wijas, Baptiste J.; Cornwell, William K.; Letnic, Mike			Herbivores disrupt the flow of food resources to termites in dryland ecosystems	ECOLOGY												Irruption of herbivore populations due to the extirpation of predators has led to dramatic changes in ecosystem functioning worldwide. Herbivores compete with other species for their primary source of nutrition, plant biomass. Such competition is typically considered to occur between species in closely related clades and functional groups but could also occur with detritivores that consume senescent plant biomass. In this study, we tested predictions that in ecosystems where herbivores are not regulated by predators, their indirect impacts on dead vegetation increase with primary productivity and extend to termites that feed on senescent vegetation. We compared dead vegetation cover and termite activity in herbivore exclosures and associated grazed plots at three locations situated along a rainfall gradient in arid Australia where kangaroo populations have irrupted. Dead vegetation cover and termite activity increased with rainfall in ungrazed plots but showed a negligible response to rainfall in grazed plots. Our results suggest that grazing can disrupt the flow of energy to detritivores and decouple the relationship between termite activity and primary productivity. Such disruption could have far-reaching impacts on arid ecosystems because many organisms sit within "brown food webs" that are sustained by energy derived from the decomposition of senescent plant tissues.

Indigenous and Local Knowledge (ILK) supports the design and practice of ecological restoration across rural to urban gradients - including both ancestral lands and contemporary places, with thought leaders advocating for biocultural approaches to address biodiversity loss, land occupation, and the colonial legacies of social and economic marginalization of Indigenous Peoples. To date, there are few examples in Hawai'i, where in 1893 the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom disenfranchised most Indigenous People of land, freshwater, and coastal resources. Here we describe the Pu'u-wa'awa'a Community-Based Subsistence Forest Area (P-CBSFA), that was formed in 2017 to steward 34-ha of land within the Pu'uwa'awa'a State Forest Reserve, North Kona, Hawai'i Island and is led by multi-generational lineal descendants of Pu'uwa'awa'a. We focus on how this stewardship initiative has relied on holistic acknowledgement in the engagement of historical context, a Native Hawaiian conceptualization of the resto-ration process, and a collaborative and consensus-based restoration practice that includes non-profit organiza-tions and state and federal agencies. This initiative, the first community-based and subsistence-focused forest restoration project on State of Hawai'i administered lands, is using a biocultural framework to transform 34-ha of non-native and fire-prone grasses into a native species dominated dryland subsistence forest. To do this, the P-CBSFA relies on a relationship ethic to: (i) build trust among partners; (ii) articulate an exportable vision of ILK-based restoration; (iii) walk in awareness of historical and contemporary injustices; (iv) enhance cultural values of the landscape; (v) establish and rely on formal, empathy focused communication; (vi) focus on community directed benefits; and most importantly (vii) cultivate joy. From this framework, the P-CBSFA emerges to provide a multi-dimensional passageway through which lineal descendants of Pu'uwa'awa'a are formalizing governance and decision-making authority over their ancestral lands.

J	Mayor, AG; Bautista, S; Rodriguez, F; Kéfi, S				Mayor, Angeles G.; Bautista, Susana; Rodriguez, Francisco; Kefi, Sonia			Connectivity-Mediated Ecohydrological Feedbacks and Regime Shifts in Drylands	ECOSYSTEMS												Identified as essential mechanisms promoting alternative stable states, positive feedbacks have been the focus of most former studies on the potential for catastrophic shifts in drylands. Conversely, little is known about how negative feedbacks could counterbalance the effects of positive feedbacks. A decrease in vegetation cover increases the connectivity of bare-soil areas and entails a global loss of runoff-driven resources from the ecosystem but also a local increase in runoff transferred from bare-soil areas to vegetation patches. In turn, these global resource losses and local resource gains decrease and increase vegetation cover, respectively, resulting in a global positive and a local negative feedback loop. We propose that the interplay of these two interconnected ecohydrological feedbacks of opposite sign determines the vulnerability of dryland ecosystems to catastrophic shifts. To test this hypothesis, we developed a spatially explicit model and assessed the effects of varying combinations of feedback strengths on the dynamics, resilience, recovery potential, and spatial structure of the system. Increasing strengths of the local negative feedback relative to the global positive feedback decreased the risk of catastrophic shifts, facilitated recovery from a degraded state, and promoted the formation of banded vegetation patterns. Both feedbacks were most relevant at low vegetation cover due to the nonlinear increase in hydrological connectivity with decreasing vegetation. Our modelling results suggest that catastrophic shifts to degraded states are less likely in drylands with strong source-sink dynamics and/or strong response of vegetation growth to resource redistribution and that feedback manipulation can be useful to enhance dryland restoration.

However, the key resources (solar radiation, temperature, and precipitation) that affect crop production vary greatly in different dryland areas, and the best results will not be achieved if farmland planting methods are applied blindly. This study was initiated to identify the appropriate farmland planting patterns based on regional hydrothermal characteristics. Four different planting patterns were tested for several years in semiarid (2013-2018) and semi-humid (2015-2018) sites in the dryland area of northwest China: (i) ridge-furrow planting pattern where only the ridges were mulched using plastic-film (R), (ii) flat planting pattern with full plastic-film mulch (P), (iii) flat planting pattern with full straw mulch (S), and (iv) conventional tillage without mulch (control). The crop productivity and related factors were studied, i.e., air temperature, precipitation, soil moisture and soil temperature. Hydrothermal conditions significantly affected the crop productivity performance under different planting patterns. The average yield increased by 33.3 %, 73.8 %, and -10.4 % in the semi-arid area, under R, P and S, respectively, and by 17.3 %, 17.5 %, and 6.7 % in the semi-humid area. In addition, the water use efficiencies under R, P, and S was 26.8, 33.5, and 18.3 kg mm(-1) ha(-1), respectively, in the semiarid area, and 30.4, 28.8, and 27.3 kg mm(-1) ha(-1) in the semi-humid area. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the soil temperature from seedling to jointing was the most important environmental factor that affected crop productivity in the semi-arid area, followed by evapotranspiration and precipitation during the growth period. The difference in crop productivity in the semi-humid area was mainly determined by precipitation during the growth period and evapotranspiration. Therefore, screening appropriate planting methods based on the major limiting factors in different regions is effective for maintaining farmland productivity.

Climate Change Effect on Water Use Efficiency under Selected Soil and Water Conservation Practices in the Ruzizi Catchment, Eastern D.R. Congo	LAND												Concerns have been raised on the effectiveness and sustainability of Soil and Water Conservation (SWC) practices as adaptation options to climate change and high intra- and inter-annual rainfall variabilities in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This study was conducted in the Ruzizi Plain, a dryland area, to assess the performance of maize (Zea mays L.) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) and two SWC practices (tied ridges and conventional tillage). The AgMIP's Regional Integrated Assessment (RIA) approach was used to simulate Water Use Efficiency (WUE) under the Cropping System Model-Crop Environment Resource Synthesis (CSM-CERES-Maize) of the Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer (DSSAT). The model was calibrated using experimental data from nine cropping seasons (2011-2018) and 100 farms. The model sensitivity was assessed as a function of temperature, water, and SWC practices for the same environments. Initial conditions of crop management practices were used as input data for CSM-CERES-Maize. Current climate data were extracted from AgMERRA datasets corrected with local data for the period of 1980 to 2021. Future climate projections (2022-2099) were obtained after down-scaling the data from the 29 General Circulation Models (GCMS) of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) and subsetted to five GCMs based on climate regimes. GCMS results were a strong indicator that climate change in this DRC dryland will result in an increase in average annual temperatures for both RCP 4.5 and 8.5, with the highest increase (3.05 degrees C) under hot/dry conditions for RCP8.5 and the lowest (1.04 degrees C) under cool/dry conditions for RCP 4.5. All the models selected for five climate regimes for 2022-2099 showed no change in the rainfall trends for RCP 4.5 (p > 0.05). The models projected yield declines of 5-25%, with less yield losses under tied ridges as an adaptation practice. The use of efficient SWC practices could therefore be a promising strategy in reducing potential losses from climate change in drylands of eastern DRC.

Predicted climate change (precipitation reductions and temperature increases) and anthropogenic activities such as groundwater drawdown jeopardise the functioning of these ecosystems, presenting new challenges for their management. We developed a trait-based analysis to examine the spatiotemporal variability in the ecophysiology of Ziziphus lotus, a long-lived phreatophyte that dominates one of the few terrestrial GDEs of semiarid regions in Europe. We assessed morpho-functional traits and stem water potential along a naturally occurring gradient of depth-to-groundwater (DTGW, 2-25 m) in a coastal aquifer, and throughout the species-growing season. Increasing DTGW and salinity negatively affected photosynthetic and transpiration rates, increasing plant water stress (lower predawn and midday water potential), and positively affected Huber value (sapwood cross-sectional area per leaf area), reducing leaf area and likely, plant hydraulic demand. However, the species showed greater salt-tolerance at shallow depths. Despite groundwater characteristics, higher atmospheric evaporative demand in the study area, which occurred in summer, fostered higher transpiration rates and water stress, and promoted carbon assimilation and water loss more intensively at shallow water tables. This multiple-trait analysis allowed us to identify plant ecophysiological thresholds related to the increase in salinity, but mostly in DTGW (13 m), and in the evaporative demand during the growing season. These findings highlight the existence of tipping points in the functioning of a long-lived phreatophyte in drylands and can contribute to the sustainable management of GDEs in southern Europe, paving the way for further studies on phreatophytic species.

Esther; Manrique, Esteban; Duran, Jorge			Simulated nitrogen deposition influences soil greenhouse gas fluxes in a Mediterranean dryland	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Soil nitrogen (N) availability is a key driver of soil-atmosphere greenhouse gas (GHG) exchange, yet we are far from understanding how increases in N deposition due to human activities will influence the net soil-atmosphere fluxes of the three most important GHGs: nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2). We simulated four levels of N deposition (10, 20 and 50 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), plus unfertilised control) to evaluate their effects on N2O, CH4 and CO2 soil fluxes in a semiarid shrubland in central Spain. After 8 years of experimental fertilisation, increasing N availability led to a consistent increase in N2O emissions, likely due to simultaneous increases in soil microbial nitrification and/or denitrification processes. However, only intermediate levels of N fertilisation reduced CH4 uptake, while increasing N fertilisation had no effects on CO2 fluxes, suggesting complex interactions between N deposition loads and GHG fluxes. Our study provides novel insight into the responses of GHGs to N deposition in drylands, forecasting increases in N2O emissions, and decreases in CH4 uptake rates, with likely consequences to the on-going climate change.

J	Sun, QQ; Zhang, P; Jiao, X; Han, WC; Sun, YN; Sun, DF				Sun, Qiangqiang; Zhang, Ping; Jiao, Xin; Han, Wenchao; Sun, Yanan; Sun, Danfeng			Identifying and understanding alternative states of dryland landscape: A hierarchical analysis of time series of fractional vegetation-soil nexuses in China's Hexi Corridor	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Understanding and early identification of state transitions in dryland systems' landscape pattern are challenging but critical for conservation planning and sustainable management strategies. Currently the alternative states of drylands have been identified based on dynamics of single vegetation index (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index), with the interactions between vegetation and soil components often being neglected. Here, we proposed a framework for identifying the alternative states in relation to land degradation based on the interactive pathways of fractional vegetation and soil-related endmember nexuses. In this framework, we initially generated 16-day fractional green vegetation endmember (green vegetation [GV]) and soil-related endmembers (sand [SL], saline [SA], dark surface [DA]) time series using a standardized linear spectral mixture analysis model in the Hexi Corridor during 2001-2017. A discrete wavelet transform based trends and turning points detection (DWT-TTD) algorithm was proposed to detect trends, turning point types, and timing of these time series records. These metrics were subsequently used to identify eight state transition pathways for each endmember and synthetic degradation processes at the appropriate 5-10 year scale. We found that the unmixed fractional endmembers exhibited a consistent agreement with both field abundance values and estimated fractions from high-spatial-resolution Google Earth images. Based on the DWT-TTD algorithm derived alternative pathways, we found that four positive pathways of GV and DA fractions can be observed in the vegetated areas were integrated with corresponding negative pathways of SA and SL fractions. These pathways resulted in remarkably increasing GV (+4551.81 km2) and DA (+9749.26 km2) and significantly declining SA (-1452.70 km2) and SL (-9555.57 km2) from 2001 to 2017. These processes were linked to increased precipitation and temperature and reduced drought degree. Also, the timing of the turning points (around 2007 and 2013) was largely coincidental with the timing of ecological management, suggesting that ecological governance played a crucial role in the state shifts. However, because of drought trends in the barren regions, land desertification exhibited an increasing occurrence in extent (+2.5% of total pixels) during the study period, which may increase in the future, as indicated by the large pixel proportion of initially positive reversal pathway for SL (9.31%). Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the DWT-TTD algorithm, as a multi-resolution analysis method, has the potential to detect hierarchical temporal changes and disentangle the cross-scale inherent shifts of vegetation-soil systems. The framework can help devise sustainable management practices that maintain land degradation neutrality, especially when integrated with land use cover change analysis.					wang, wei/JBS-7400-2023; Wang, Siyi/JNT-2690-2023														0169-2046	1872-6062				NOV	2021	215								104225	10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.104225	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.104225													WOS:000696646500005
J	Garibotti, IA; Polo, MG; Satti, P				Garibotti, Irene A.; Gonzalez Polo, Marina; Satti, Patricia			Compost promotes biocrust and plant growth in greenhouse cocultures for dryland restoration	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Biocrusts and plants are the main ground cover and provide multiple ecosystem functions in arid and semiarid areas. As land degradation worsens and waste management is ever more pressing, the use of composted waste appears as a sustainable restoration practice to enhance vegetation reestablishment, but its effects on biocrusts still remain largely understudied. Moreover, developing appropriate methods for the co-introduction of plants and biocrusts can be an emerging approach to reconstruct the biocrust/plant interaction and their associated functions. We evaluated the effect of different compost types on biocrust and plant cocultivations. We performed a greenhouse mesocosm experiment using urban organic solid waste and sewage sludge composts to grow a moss-dominated biocrust and seedlings of two pioneer shrubs (Senecio filaginoides and Acaena splendens) in the Patagonian steppe. Both compost types successfully enhanced biocrust cover and chlorophyll a development, with cultured biocrusts being compositionally similar to the natural inoculum. Only the addition of composted sewage sludge enhanced seedling growth, and biocrusts had significant but opposite effects (positive/negative) on the two plant species we used for experimentation. This difference in the biocrust/plant interaction outcome was likely mediated by the significant influence of biocrusts on the relative availability of ammonium and nitrate and possible plant species-specific preferences for different inorganic nitrogen forms. We conclude that the application of sewage sludge compost effectively improves the success of biocrust and plant cocultures, but species-specific differences in the performance of seedlings growing in biocrusted soils impose limits on attempts to promote biocrust and plant joint restoration.																			1061-2971	1526-100X				2023 SEP 19	2023										10.1111/rec.14020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.14020		SEP 2023											WOS:001067733400001

This study aims to simulate maize (Zea mays L.) ET using a crop modeling system and compare that to ET measured using an eddy-covariance (EC) system. An EC system was used to collect growing season ET data from a rainfed maize field in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Supporting soil and plant growth data were also collected. The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT)-Crop Environment Resource Synthesis (CERES)-Maize model was used in this study. Results from DSSAT's ET simulation methods, FAO-56 and Priestley-Taylor, were compared to measured ET. Results indicated a low coefficient of determination (R-2) between simulated and measured ET, due to overestimation of simulated ET in all 3 yr. The average percent root mean square error for the daily ET simulation across all 3 yr was 34.6% for the Priestley-Taylor method and 30.4% for the FAO-56 method. For the FAO-56 simulation, the average seasonal overestimation compared to measured ET was 59 mm and the average R-2 was .59. For the Priestley-Taylor method, the average seasonal overestimation was 72 mm and the average R-2 was .57. Possible sources of error contributing to this overestimation include DSSAT's potential ET estimations, crop coefficient estimation, and the simulation of soil water balance in vertisols with high swell-shrink clay minerals. The mixed simulation results, particularly compared to those seen in studies of irrigated crops, indicate a greater need to improve ET estimation capabilities in rainfed systems.

In arid environments, unpredictable changes in water and forage resources are known drivers of nomadic movements. Water resources vary temporally but are often spatially stationary, whereas foraging resources are often both temporally and spatially variable. These differences may lead to different types of nomadic movements: forage- vs. water-driven nomadism. Our study investigates these two different types of nomadism in relation to resource gradients from mesic steppe to xeric desert environments in Mongolia's Gobi-Steppe Ecosystem. We hypothesized that in the desert, where water is a key resource, animals are more water-dependent and may show water-driven nomadism with frequent revisits to spatially fixed resources, while in the steppe, animals are less water-dependent and may show forage-driven nomadism, tracking high-quality foraging patches with infrequent revisits to previously used resources. We utilized GPS movement data from 40 individuals of four ungulate species (Mongolian gazelle, goitered gazelle, saiga antelope, and Asiatic wild ass) in the Gobi-Steppe Ecosystem. We calculated displacement distances and recursion metrics and subsequently performed a principal component analysis to quantify the variation in movement patterns. The satellite-derived vegetation greenness served as a proxy for the resource gradient and was associated with variation in movement behaviors described by the first principal component, demonstrating that the variability in movements was closely related to the resource gradient from mesic to xeric habitats. We showed that ungulates in the resource-rich steppe tended to move long distances with few revisits (forage-driven nomadism), while ungulates in the resource-poor desert tended to move shorter distances with more revisits (water-driven nomadism). Our results suggest that xeric and mesic habitats promote different types of nomadic strategies. These results have important implications for conservation strategies: Forage-driven nomads primarily require a high degree of landscape-level permeability, and water-driven nomads additionally require the protection of ephemeral water bodies and actions to maintain the functional connectivity between them.

We contribute to this debate by studying effects of a randomly allocated, nationwide development program in The Gambia on deforestation, focusing on parts of the country with meaningful baseline forest cover. Our main finding is that the program caused significant increases in annual forest loss. Conservative benchmark estimates imply that 5.6% of all forest loss occurring within 1km of treatment villages during the eight post-program years resulted from the program. Accounting for spillovers, we estimate that the program explains about one quarter of the forest loss around all villages. Looking at possible channels, we find moderate treatment effects of the development program on household wealth and livestock holdings. Further, villages with limited access to markets drive the effect of the program on deforestation.

J	Eldridge, DJ; Delgado-Baquerizo, M				Eldridge, David J.; Delgado-Baquerizo, Manuel			The influence of climatic legacies on the distribution of dryland biocrust communities	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Predicting the distribution of biocrust species, mosses, lichens and liverworts associated with surface soils is difficult, but climatic legacies (changes in climate over the last 20 k years) can improve our prediction of the distribution of biocrust species. To provide empirical support for this hypothesis, we used a combination of network analyses and structural equation modelling to identify the role of climatic legacies in predicting the distribution of ecological clusters formed by species of mosses, lichens and liverworts using data from 282 large sites distributed across 0.6 million km(2) of eastern Australia. Two ecological clusters contained 87% of the 120 moss, lichen and liverwort species. Both clusters contained lichen, moss and liverwort species, but were dominated by different families. Sites where the air temperature increased the most over 20k years (positive temperature legacies) were associated with reductions in the relative abundance of species from the lichen (Peltulaceae and Teloschistaceae) and moss (Bryaceae) families (Cluster A species), greater groundstorey plant cover and lower soil pH. Sites where precipitation has increased over the past 20k years (positive precipitation legacy) were associated with increases in the relative abundance of lichen (Cladoniaceae, Lecideaceae and Thelotremataceae) and moss (Pottiaceae) families (Cluster B species) and lower levels of soil pH. Sites where temperatures have increased the most in the past 20k years suppressed the negative effects of plant cover on Cluster B by reducing plant cover. Increased intensity of grazing suppressed the negative effect of soil pH and the positive effect of soil carbon, on the relative abundance of Cluster B taxa. Finally, increasing temperature and precipitation legacies reduced the negative effect of soil pH on Cluster B. Understanding of the importance of climatic legacies improves our ability to predict how biocrust assemblies might respond to ongoing global environmental change associated with increasing land use intensification, increasing temperature and reduced rainfall.

Interannual variability of spring and summer monsoon growing season carbon exchange at a semiarid savanna over nearly two decades	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Eddy covariance measurements of land-atmosphere energy, carbon, and water exchange now span multiple decades at some sites, supporting an improved understanding of flux interannual variability (IAV) and its ecophysiological and physical controls. Most eddy covariance IAV studies have focused on temperate forest ecosystems, where carbon fluxes are large and flux records are longest - but also where IAV is much lower than in dryland regions, which have been identified as an essential driver of the trend and variability in the global terrestrial carbon sink. In this study, we leveraged 19 years of continuous micrometeorological measurements at the AmeriFlux US-SRM mesquite savanna site in southern Arizona, USA to quantify the IAV, trends, and drivers of carbon fluxes during the distinct spring and summer growing seasons. We also assessed the ability of modern satellite and land surface models to capture the IAV of seasonal water and carbon fluxes. Annual net ecosystem production (NEP) was small and highly variable (23 +/-64 gC m -2 yr � 1). Precipitation and associated measures of water availability determined most of the variability in NEP, largely through their influence on annual and seasonal gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) as opposed to ecosystem respiration (ER). Root-zone soil moisture captured between 73% (spring) and 85% (summer) of GEP variability and between 73% (spring) and 58% (summer) of ER variability. Throughout the study period, soil moisture and greenness increased with associated increases in GEP, ER and NEP. These trends were strongly influenced by very productive and wet summer growing seasons during the last two years, which were characterized by abundant understory grass cover. Typically, less than half of the variability in growing season GEP and evapotranspiration was captured by satellite-based estimates and land surface model simulations with local site forcing and calibration, highlighting the ongoing utility of long-term datasets to support careful model testing and improvement.					; MacBean, Natasha/L-2190-2015; Dannenberg, Matthew/G-8826-2016	Knowles, John/0000-0002-3697-9439; Mahmud, Kashif/0000-0002-8198-4325; MacBean, Natasha/0000-0001-6797-4836; Dannenberg, Matthew/0000-0002-6518-4897													0168-1923	1873-2240				AUG 15	2023	339								109584	10.1016/j.agrformet.2023.109584	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2023.109584		JUN 2023											WOS:001037040000001
J	He, L; Li, ZL; Wang, XM; Xie, YW; Ye, JS				He, Lei; Li, Zhao-Liang; Wang, Xunming; Xie, Yaowen; Ye, Jian-Sheng			Lagged precipitation effect on plant productivity is influenced collectively by climate and edaphic factors in drylands	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Lagged precipitation effect explains a large proportion of annual aboveground net primary productivity in some dryland ecosystems. Using satellite-derived plant productivity and precipitation datasets in the Northern Hemisphere drylands during 2000-2018, we identify 1111 pixels mainly located in the Tibetan Plateau, the western US, and Kazakhstan where productivities are significantly correlated with previous-year precipitation (hereafter, the lagged type). Differences in climatic and edaphic factors between the lagged and unlagged (pixels where productivities are not correlated with previous-year precipitation) types are evaluated. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance shows that the two types differ significantly regarding six climatic and edaphic factors. Compared to unlagged type, water availability, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, field capacity, silt content and radiation are more sensitive to changes in precipitation in lagged type. Water availability is the most important factor for distinguishing the two types, followed by soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, field capacity, soil texture, and radiation. Our study suggests that the altered sensitivities of several climatic and edaphic factors to precipitation collectively affect the lagged effect of precipitation on productivity in drylands.

Salinity balance and historical flushing quantified in a high-rainfall catchment (Mount Lofty Ranges, South Australia)	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Human-induced landscape salinization, including the effects of dryland salinity, is negatively impacting many catchments in southern Australia. Salinization occurs due to increased recharge and water-table rise following land clearing of deep-rooted native vegetation. In low-lying areas with poor drainage, groundwater-level rise can lead to increased evapotranspiration, mobilization of vadose zone salt, and salt scalding. Alternatively, these same processes of increased recharge and groundwater rise can lead to decreased salinization as accumulated salts are flushed into surface waters. This study in a high-rainfall area of the Mount Lofty Ranges of South Australia documents catchment desalinization. A 28-year record (1989-2016) of flow and salinity in Scott Creek was analysed based on monthly data. Analysis of catchment-scale chloride deposition and export determined that approximately three times more chloride is exported than is input to the catchment from atmospheric sources. Over the time period investigated, salt load exported to surface water decreased by, on average, 6.4t annually due to catchment freshening. Analysis of monthly salinity balance of a sub-catchment drained by an intermittent stream demonstrates that accumulation of chloride, rather than export, occurs during drought years. In the catchment, as a whole, salts are being flushed via groundwater flow into the permanent stream in all years of the record. Deep groundwater is input to the permanent stream, with mixing of deeper more saline and fresher shallow groundwater. Thus, a complex interaction of landscape hydrologic parameters such as relief, precipitation, chloride deposition and land-use history, determine whether a catchment undergoes salinization or desalinization.

Salinity Effects on Morpho-Physiological and Yield Traits of Soybean (<i>Glycine max</i> L.) as Mediated by Foliar Spray with Brassinolide	PLANTS-BASEL												Salinity episodes that are common in arid regions, characterized by dryland, are adversely affecting crop production worldwide. This study evaluated the effectiveness of brassinolide (BL) in ameliorating salinity stress imposed on soybean at four levels (control (1.10), 32.40, 60.60 and 86.30 mM/L NaCl) in factorial combination with six BL application frequency (control (BL0), application at seedling (BL1), flowering (BL2), podding (BL3), seedling + flowering (BL4) and seedling + flowering + podding (BL5)) stages. Plant growth attributes, seed yield, and N, P, K, Ca and Mg partitioning to leaves, stems and roots, as well as protein and seed-N concentrations, were significantly (p <= 0.05) reduced by salinity stress. These trends were ascribed to considerable impairments in the photosynthetic pigments, photosynthetically active radiation, leaf stomatal conductance and relative water content in the leaves of seedlings under stress. The activity of peroxidase and superoxidase significantly (p <= 0.05) increased with salinity. Foliar spray with BL significantly (p <= 0.05) improved the photosynthetic attributes, as well as nutrient partitioning, under stress, and alleviated ion toxicity by maintaining a favourable K+/Na+ ratio and decreasing oxidative damage. Foliar spray with brassinolide could sustain soybean growth and seed yield at salt concentrations up to 60.60 mM/L NaCl.

All fluorescent pseudomonads isolates had the ability to grow at different drought stress levels and at salinity level of 4% NaCl. In addition, a significant percentage of these isolates retained their ability to produce PGP traits (especially P solubilization and indole-3-acetic acid production) in the presence of salinity. The results showed that 80% FC moisture level compared to 55% FC moisture level significantly increased plant growth indices and P uptake by wheat plant. In most of the measured parameters, RP treatment (8 mg P kg(-1) soil) alone did not show any significant difference compared to negative control (without RP and TSP), but combination treatments with RP and TSP at all levels (3, 6, and 9 mg P kg(-1) soil) increased these parameters compared to negative control. In non-stress and water-deficit stress conditions, bacterial strains significantly increased soil available P, growth indices (a 41.6% increase in root dry weight and an 11% increase in shoot dry weight), grain yield (a 17% increase), shoot P uptake of wheat plant as compared to control (without bacterial strains). Overall, the results of this study showed that dryland wheat rhizosphere harbors drought- and salinity-tolerant phosphate-solubilizing fluorescent pseudomonads isolates with potential of producing PGP traits in the presence or absence of salinity and improving P uptake by the plant under water-deficit stress.

We analyzed the response of a predator community of jackals, wolves and foxes to land-management choices, and how that response in turn affects native gazelles and Acacia vegetation in the Arava Valley of Israel. This hyperarid region is characterized by contrasting regimes comprising privatized (Moshavim) and communal (Kibbutzim) agricultural settlements, which provides ideal conditions for evaluating how land-management differences translate into crop choices, affecting resource availability and ecosystem changes. Integrating multi-year field observations of predators and gazelles with agricultural datasets, we show that shifts in land-use strategies have cascading ecological impacts. This is evident in the association of date orchards, an expanding land use especially in Kibbutzim, with shifts in the geographical and seasonal distributions of predators. Increased predator presence due to resource availability has displaced gazelles farther from settlements, subsequently impacting Acacia seed dispersal and recruitment. Considering the global expansion of dryland agriculture, the evidence of such socio-ecological cascading effects suggests the necessity to approach agricultural management at the landscape scale in desert regions.					le Polain, Yann/N-2554-2016; Erinjery, Joseph/J-8443-2019; Iwamura, Takuya/D-1125-2018	le Polain, Yann/0000-0001-9887-7270; Erinjery, Joseph/0000-0002-5690-838X; Iwamura, Takuya/0000-0002-3740-7758													0140-1963	1095-922X				SEP	2021	192								104547	10.1016/j.jaridenv.2021.104547	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2021.104547		JUN 2021											WOS:000663808500008

Since overbank flooding has been considered the driving factor of vegetation distribution on floodplains, sustainable water resource management requires a better understanding of the influence of inundation on vegetation distribution. We examined the relationship between the distribution of four flood-dependant vegetation communities and associated long term inundation metrics on the upper Darling River floodplain using electivity analysis and a generalised additive model (GAM) by generating a total of 10,478 individual inundation maps with a high spatial resolution over a period of 29 years. Our results show that the four dominant vegetation communities are situated differently in relation to inundation attributes. The inundation metrics better explained the variation in the distribution of River Red Gum than those of Black box, Coolabah and Lignum communities. We found that the floodplain forests and woodlands in the upper Darling can survive longer periods of drought and shorter inundation duration than previously reported. The results provide practical information for ecosystem management by offering a means of predicting changes in vegetation distribution in relation to alteration in flow regime resulting from water planning arrangements or climate change.

Data were collected from multiple seasons at Managed Environment Facilities (MEFs; field experimental facilities to control and target water supply) at three locations across the Australian wheatbelt. The minimum water required to obtain a measurable yield was less in reduced-tillering than free-tillering NILs (70 vs 95 mm). Above this minimum, for every mm increase in water supply, grain yield in free-tillering lines increased more rapidly (that is, showed greater responsiveness) than reduced-tillering lines (15.4 vs 12.6 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)). This difference suggests the reduced-tillering gene is associated with greater yield potential in situations with water supply of less than 200 mm. Reduced-tillering wheat also affords a 0.3 t ha(-1) yield benefit in extremely water-limited, low yielding situations where no measurable yield is expected with free-tillering wheats (i.e. at water supply 95 mm). These specific adaptations need to be considered when contemplating the use of reduced-tillering wheats in dryland systems where water is a key limiting factor.

Metastability as a Coexistence Mechanism in a Model for Dryland Vegetation Patterns	BULLETIN OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY												Vegetation patterns are a ubiquitous feature of water-deprived ecosystems. Despite the competition for the same limiting resource, coexistence of several plant species is commonly observed. We propose a two-species reaction-diffusion model based on the single-species Klausmeier model, to analytically investigate the existence of states in which both species coexist. Ecologically, the study finds that coexistence is supported if there is a small difference in the plant species' average fitness, measured by the ratio of a species' capabilities to convert water into new biomass to its mortality rate. Mathematically, coexistence is not a stable solution of the system, but both spatially uniform and patterned coexistence states occur as metastable states. In this context, a metastable solution in which both species coexist corresponds to a long transient (exceeding 103 years in dimensional parameters) to a stable one-species state. This behaviour is characterised by the small size of a positive eigenvalue which has the same order of magnitude as the average fitness difference between the two species. Two mechanisms causing the occurrence of metastable solutions are established: a spatially uniform unstable equilibrium and a stable one-species pattern which is unstable to the introduction of a competitor. We further discuss effects of asymmetric interspecific competition (e.g. shading) on the metastability property.

However, there is a lack of research on whether the inclusion of GM crops enhances the C economy under semiarid conditions. An ongoing field experiment was conducted on Cumulic Haplustoll in the northwest region of China to (i) quantify the biomass C release patterns of three GM legumes; (ii) evaluate the effect of the GM legumes on the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock (0-20 cm depth), and (iii) estimate the soil C dynamics for the GM systems under semiarid conditions in more detail. The results showed that the percentages of the remaining GM C in the soil after one year of decomposition averaged 26% and 33% for the above-ground and below-ground residues, respectively. Thus, the 5-yr growth of GM legumes continuously significantly improved the SOC and easily oxidized organic carbon (EOOC) concentrations, as well as the corresponding stocks (except for soybean) (P < 0.01), compared with the original soil at the 0-20 cm depth. We estimated the annual decomposition rate of SOC as 1%, and the C added by the crops that remained in the SOC as 23% each year using the one-compartment model. The mean turnover time of the SOC at equilibrium was estimated to be 22 years, indicating that the loess soil was not C saturated and still had the potential for C sequestration. In general, Huai bean performed better on biomass production, C accumulation, and soil C sequestration than mung bean and soybean under the dryland conditions during the 5-yr period of this study. Consequently, the cultivation of leguminous GM during the summer is a better option than bare fallow to improve the soil fertility and environmental sustainability not only in the Loess Plateau of China but also in other similar dryland regions.																			0016-7061	1872-6259				MAR 1	2019	337						425	433		10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.09.053	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.09.053													WOS:000456761500044

Satellite-based precipitation products are often used in these regions to improve data availability. This research presents the first validation study in Syria for Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) estimates using in-situ precipitation data. The validation was performed using accuracy and categorical statistics in the semi-arid Barada Basin, Syria, between 2000 and 2020. Multiple temporal scales (daily, pentad, monthly, seasonally, and annual) were utilized to investigate the accuracy of CHIRPS estimates. The CHIRPS results indicated advantages and disadvantages. The main promising result was achieved at the seasonal scale. Implementing CHIRPS for seasonal drought was proven to be suitable for the Barada Basin. Low bias (PBwinter = 2.1%, PBwet season = 12.7%), high correlation (r(wet season) = 0.79), and small error (ME = 4.25 mm/winter) support the implementation of CHIRPS in winter and wet seasons for seasonal drought monitoring. However, it was observed that CHIRPS exhibited poor performance (inland pentads) in reproducing precipitation amounts at finer temporal scales (pentad and daily). Underestimation of precipitation event amounts was evident in all accuracy statistics results, and the magnitude of error was higher with more intense events. CHIRPS results better corresponded in wet months than dry months. Additionally, the results showed that CHIRPS had poor detection skill in drylands; on average, only 20% of all in-situ precipitation events were correctly detected by CHIRPS with no effect of topography found on detection skill performance. This research could be valuable for decision-makers in dryland regions (as well as the Barada Basin) for water resource planning and drought early warning systems using CHIRPS.					shi, xiaogang/HZL-9299-2023	Alsilibe, Firas/0000-0003-3327-262X; Alghafli, Khaled/0000-0001-8888-9016														2072-4292				APR	2023	15	7							1778	10.3390/rs15071778	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15071778													WOS:000969915400001

Here, we selected 68 plots from a typical dryland region of Northwest China to explore how and to what extent different environmental and spatial factors influence plant beta-diversity of different growth forms. The results showed that environmental and spatial factors were significantly correlated with whole community, shrub and herb beta-diversity (P < 0.001), and the combinations of soil, climate, topography, and spatial factors explained approximately 24, 10, and 20% of the variation in whole community, shrub and herb beta-diversity, indicating that niche and neutral processes work together to regulate plant beta-diversity in drylands of Northwest China. However, the relative contribution of environmental filtering and spatial processes varid between shrub and herb layers, where shrub beta-diversity was predominantly determined by spatial processes, but herb beta-diversity was largely determined by environmental filtering. Taken together, these findings provide an important empirical evidence that niche processes may not always be dominant processes of community assembly, even in harsh environments of drylands. Future research that focuses on the comparisons among different plant growth forms would likely shed new insights into mechanisms of community assembly under climate change. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Dryland crop production and economic returns for crop residue harvest or grazing	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												While crop residues could provide an additional source of revenue for agricultural producers, there are concerns that harvesting these residues could have negative effects on productivity and economic returns. Although crop residue harvest effects have been studied in wetter areas, including the U.S. Corn Belt and Southeast, there have been few studies in more arid areas. The objective of this analysis was to quantify intermediate-term (6-yr) effects of crop residue harvest on crop productivity and economic returns for different biomass harvest intensities and methods, and for different practices aimed at mitigating negative effects of residue harvest in the U.S. Northern Great Plains. Crop rotation treatments included spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-dry pea (Pisum sativum L.), W-P; spring wheat-dry pea/cover crop mix, W-P/CC; and spring wheat-dry pea-corn (Zea mays L.), W-P-C. Biomass removal treatments included no biomass removal, bale and remove wheat straw, bale and remove residues from each crop, and graze all crop residues. Significant corn yield reductions occurred when baling crop residues, but not with grazing. However, significant spring wheat yield reductions occurred with grazing in the W-P rotation. Grazing may be more suited to the W-P-C rotation than the W-P or W-P/CC rotations as the breakeven grazing price was lower in this rotation, and the grazing treatment in this rotation had both relatively high economic returns and low economic risk over the study period.

Moss-biocrusts strongly decrease soil surface albedo, altering land-surface energy balance in a dryland ecosystem	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Land surface albedo measures the degree to which the sun's radiation is absorbed or reflected, and thus can be highly influential in global climate trends, local weather phenomena, and biological processes. As an extensive living cover in drylands, biocrusts cover substantial land surface but their potential influences on surface albedo and energy balance are underdocumented, and its temporal dynamic is virtually unknown. We continuously measured the surface albedo, land-surface energy balance, temperature and moisture of moss-biocrust covered soil and bare soil for two years, and measured the surface color and roughness of the two land cover types. Our results showed that the surface albedo of the biocrusts was 43.4% lower than that of the bare soil, due to the increased darkness (43.7%) and roughness (90.4%) together with increased moisture (20.7%) of the biocrust layer. Through time, the albedo of the biocrusts were negatively and linearly related with surface soil temperature or moisture, which resulted in lower albedo in summer and higher albedo in other seasons. As a result of decreased albedo, biocrusts decreased outgoing short-wave radiation by 44.8% in comparison to the bare soil, and consequently they increased net short-wave radiation by 11.4% and net all-wave solar radiation by 22.9% However, the increased energy absorption by the biocrusts did not consistently increase soil temperature; instead, soil temperature increased by up to 9.3 degrees C under dry conditions but decreased by as much as 11.4 degrees C under wet conditions, resulting in a net cooling. This indicates that the temperature regimes of the biocrust-covered soil were not determined only by albedo, but also by modification of soil thermal properties by biocrusts. Because biocrusts are highly responsive to land use, it appears that altered albedo and energy balance may be one of the ways in which human activity can impact climate and weather.

Larrabee; Niu, Guo-Yue			Why Is the Terrestrial Water Storage in Dryland Regions Declining? A Perspective Based on Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Satellite Observations and Noah Land Surface Model With Multiparameterization Schemes Model Simulations	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Drylands cover over 40% of the global land area and are home to more than 2 billion humans. Here, we use the terrestrial water storage (TWS) anomaly data derived from GRACE satellites to assess water storage changes globally and find that drylands lost similar to 15.9 +/- 9.1 mm of water between April 2002 and January 2017. The TWS trends are more significant and apparent in dry regions than in humid regions. The decrease in TWS occurred mainly in hyperarid and arid regions. Exact causes to the observed declines in TWS remain elusive due to anthropogenic water withdrawals, atmospheric demand (potential evapotranspiration, PET) in contrast to supply (precipitation, P) caused by the warming, and terrestrial ecohydrological responses. Therefore, we use a process-based model forced by climate data to interpret the causes over three selected dryland regions showing the strongest drying trends. We find that the modeled TWS without considering anthropogenic water withdrawals explains most of the declining GRACE TWS over the southwestern North America (NA) and Middle East but underestimates the drying trend over North China. This suggests that TWS declines in the southwestern NA and the Middle East were primarily driven by the contrast between atmospheric demand and supply, whereas anthropogenic water withdrawals may have played a relatively more dominant role in TWS declines over North China. Additional model experiments indicate that terrestrial ecohydrological processes that help extract deep substrate water are critical for providing water supply additional to precipitation to sustain ET in the drying drylands at decadal scales.

The rotary seedling pick-up mechanism with a planetary gear train for non-uniform intermittent transmission, and a concave and convex locking arc device, has a large rigid impact. To solve these problems, according to the design requirements for a dryland plug seedling transplanting mechanism, a rotary seedling pick-up mechanism of a planetary gear train with combined non-circular gear transmission of incomplete eccentric circular and non-circular gears was proposed. This has the characteristics of two-times greater fluctuation of the transmission ratio in a cycle, and can achieve a non-uniform continuous drive. Through analysis of the working principle of the seedling pick-up mechanism, its kinematics model was established. The human-computer interaction optimization method and self-developed computer-aided analysis and optimization software were used to obtain a set of parameters that satisfy the operation requirements of the seedling pick-up mechanism. According to the optimized parameters, the structure of the seedling pick-up mechanism was designed, a virtual prototype of the mechanism was created, and a physical prototype was manufactured. A virtual motion simulation of the mechanism was performed, high-speed photographic kinematics tests were conducted, and the kinematic properties of the physical prototype were investigated, whereby the correctness of the theoretical model and the optimized design of the mechanism were verified. Further, laboratory seedling pick-up tests were conducted. The success ratio of seedling pick-up was 93.8% when the seedling pick-up efficiency of the mechanism was 60 plants per minute per row, indicating that the mechanism has a high efficiency and success ratio for seedling pick-up and can be applied to a dryland plug seedling transplanter.																			1000-9345	2192-8258				MAY 22	2019	32	1							49	10.1186/s10033-019-0357-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s10033-019-0357-3													WOS:000468579800001

Shrub persistence and increased grass mortality in response to drought in dryland systems	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Droughts in the southwest United States have led to major forest and grassland die-off events in recent decades, suggesting plant community and ecosystem shifts are imminent as native perennial grass populations are replaced by shrub- and invasive plant-dominated systems. These patterns are similar to those observed in arid and semiarid systems around the globe, but our ability to predict which species will experience increased drought-induced mortality in response to climate change remains limited. We investigated meteorological drought-induced mortality of nine dominant plant species in the Colorado Plateau Desert by experimentally imposing a year-round 35% precipitation reduction for eight continuous years. We distributed experimental plots across numerous plant, soil, and parent material types, resulting in 40 distinct sites across a 4,500 km(2) region of the Colorado Plateau Desert. For all 8 years, we tracked c. 400 individual plants and evaluated mortality responses to treatments within and across species, and through time. We also examined the influence of abiotic and biotic site factors in driving mortality responses. Overall, high mortality trends were driven by dominant grass species, including Achnatherum hymenoides, Pleuraphis jamesii, and Sporobolus cryptandrus. Responses varied widely from year to year and dominant shrub species were generally resistant to meteorological drought, likely due to their ability to access deeper soil water. Importantly, mortality increased in the presence of invasive species regardless of treatment, and native plant die-off occurred even under ambient conditions, suggesting that recent climate changes are already negatively impacting dominant species in these systems. Results from this long-term drought experiment suggest major shifts in community composition and, as a result, ecosystem function. Patterns also show that, across multiple soil and plant community types, native perennial grass species may be replaced by shrubs and invasive annuals in the Colorado Plateau Desert.

Genotype x environment interaction and stability in landraces of cowpea under dryland conditions	REVISTA CAATINGA												Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) is an excellent crop for research in semi-arid regions, due to its tolerance to high temperatures and water deficit, with satisfactory yields in rain-fed cultivation. The objective this work was to evaluate the genotype x environment (G x E) interaction, adaptability and stability of cowpea landraces used in the Cariri, Paraiba, in the semi-arid region of Northeast Brazil. The experiment was carried out under rain-fed conditions in two locations of this region. For all traits evaluated, the G x E interaction was simple, which means that the evaluated landraces can be recommended for the different environments tested. The results also suggest that phenotypic selection can be efficient to enhance the yield of cowpea landraces and, therefore, can be practiced by the farmers themselves. The most advantageous landraces were ranked with good stability (qi <5%). Although the performance standards between the cowpea landraces were similar in the different environments, the best values were obtained on the farm with the best environmental conservation history and with higher precipitation. Therefore, the integration between the yield of cowpea landraces, environmental conservation in agricultural landscapes, and strategic planning that considers possible variations in local precipitation is essential in models of sustainable agricultural development in semi-arid zones of Northeast Brazil.

Rainstorm regimes of amounts 60 (high), 30 (medium), and 15 (low) mm with respective intensities of 1.61, 0.52, and 0.27 mm min(-1) were simulated on 1 m(2) plot with 1% slope. Infiltration-excess runoff properties were affected by a rainstorm, but not soil-type. When combined with rainstorm, soil-type affected accumulative run-off rates. High rainstorm had different (p <= 0.05) accumulative runoff rates (0.1-0.61 mm min(-1)) and increased with clay content. Different response times of 4, 10, and 17 min for respective high, medium, and low rainstorms were quickest on higher clay plus silt content and bulk-density under high and lower rainstorms, respectively. Lower rainstorms had similar effects on accumulative runoff rates (0.01-0.05 mm min(-1)), total runoff yield (0.59-18 mm), and runoff coefficients (4.29-18%). Under the high rainstorm, total runoff yields (11.4-25.8 mm) and runoff coefficients (19-42.9%) were different and increased with clay plus fine-silt content. Although simulated rainstorms had constant intensities, results showed high rainstorms to be of primal influence on infiltration-excess runoff. Clay plus silt content and bulk-density influenced infiltration-runoff properties for respective high and lower rainstorms. Apart from rainstorm characteristics, surface clay plus silt content and bulk-density are important for harnessing surface runoff in floodplains for aquifer recharge.

Most instances of dryland degradation include some form of soil disturbance and/or soil erosion, which can hinder vegetation establishment and reduce ecosystem productivity. To combat soil erosion, researchers have identified a need for rehabilitation of biological soil crusts (biocrusts), a globally relevant community of organisms aggregating the soil surface and building soil fertility. Here, the impact of plant and biocrust cover was tested on soil erosion potential in the pinon-juniper woodlands of Bandelier National Monument, New Mexico, USA. Biocrusts were found to be similarly influential to vascular plants in reducing erosion, largely acting by promoting surface roughness. The potential to rehabilitate biocrusts within the Monument was also tested. Plots were inoculated on eroding soils before the summer monsoon with greenhouse-cultured biocrusts. In a full-factorial design, treatments to reduce or halt erosion were administered to the inoculated plots and their paired controls. These erosion-reduction treatments included barriers to overland flow (flashing), slash placement, and seeding of vascular plants. Dynamic changes to soil stability, penetration resistance, and extractable soil nutrients were observed through time, but no strong effects with the addition of biocrust inoculum, seeding, or erosion intervention treatments were seen. The results do suggest possible ways forward to successfully rehabilitate biocrust, including varying the timing of biocrust application, amending inoculum application with different types of soil stabilization techniques, and adding nutrients to soils. The insights gleaned from the lack of response brings us closer to developing effective techniques to arrest soil loss in these socially and ecologically important dryland systems.

The link between geodiversity and biodiversity incorporates physical aspects from geology, geomorphology and pedology. We aimed to assess the effects of hillslope geodiversity on the cover, composition and biophysiological properties of biological soil crusts (biocrusts) in a dryland ecosystem. The geodiversity of the hillslope is determined by the stone cover on the ground surface, the content, stones in the soil profile, and the soil depth. It is known from the scientific literature that geodiversity affects biodiversity; thus, we hypothesized that the hillslope type may affect biocrust properties that develop on these hillslopes. The results indicate that the mean covers of biocrust types in the homogeneous (low geodiversity) hillslopes were 60.6% cyanobacterial crusts and 39.4% biocrusts composed of cyanobacteria, moss and lichens, whereas those of the heterogeneous (high geodiversity) hillslopes were 81.6% cyanobacterial crusts and 18.4% biocrusts composed of cyanobacteria, moss and lichens. It was concluded that geodiversity enhances the growth of biocrust species that require higher soil moisture. The results imply that wherever restoration activities are planned, and especially in drylands, the geodiversity of the area should be taken into account. Highlights Geodiversity expressed by the degree of stoniness impacts ecosystem functioning and soil properties Geodiversity impacts the biocrust's cover and composition Geodiversity enhances the growth of biocrusts that require high soil moisture Chlorophyll a, b and a + b in biocrusts are increased in heterogeneous hillslopes					Yizhaq, Hezi/AAJ-9663-2021	Yizhaq, Hezi/0000-0001-7573-3303													1351-0754	1365-2389				SEP	2021	72	5					2308	2315		10.1111/ejss.13097	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13097		FEB 2021											WOS:000620823400001

A community-GIS supported dryland use and cover change assessment: The case of the Njemps flats in Kenya	COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE												Land use and Land Cover Changes (LULCC) are a major cause of environmental degradation in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) drylands and hence a serious problem to sustainable utilization and development of those lands. Involving communities in their detection and identification can empower and convince them of the importance of adopting practices that minimize their undesirable impacts. In this study, we applied a GIS assisted community participatory approach to detect LULCC, their drivers and effects in the drylands of mid rift valley Kenya. Focus group discussions, key informant and household head interviews were corroborated with three Landsat images for three periods of 1980, 1995 and 2019. Results from community interviews and focus group discussion reported increasing trends in cropland and shrubland, Declining trend were reported in livestock mobility, livestock herd size, forest land and natural grasses. The GIS analysis reported increase of cropland from 370 Ha to 2889 Ha, increase in shrubland by 4.2%, expansion of Lake Baringo by 1.4%, decrease in forest cover by 1.2% and decrease in natural grass pastures by 1.1%. Major driving forces for LULCC were identified as population growth, insecurity caused by cattle rustling, government policies and interventions, poor agricultural practices, drought and climate change. From the outcomes of this study, we recommended government policy strategies and interventions that support adoption of practices that mitigate adverse effects of LULCC including sustainable grazing schemes, rehabilitation of already degraded land, community participation in watershed management and adoption of soil and water conservation measures.

Thus, it is not fully understood how spatial vegetation patterns affect wind erosion on a field-scale. Based on an investigation of 36 plots of vegetation in Alxa Plateau, northwestern China, we established a multivariate linear model for temporally and spatially averaged aerodynamic roughness length (Z (0)) incorporating the height, roughness density, regularity of vegetation patches (curvature) and spacing between patches (connectivity). The curvature positively interacted with the connectivity in affecting the mean Z (0), while it was the most important factor affecting the standard deviation of Z (0). The connectivity modulated the roughness density in affecting the standard deviation of Z (0). The spatial-related terms contributed 37% and 62% to the model variance of the mean and standard deviation of Z (0), respectively. Our results validate the importance of spatial vegetation structure in the vegetation-airflow interactions, with a suggestion of estimating the heterogeneity of surface erodibility by intuitive spatial parameters. Based on that spatial vegetation patterns reflect the ecosystem states, a strengthened linkage between wind erosion and vegetation stability may be useful in erosion regulation in drylands.					liu, lin/JFK-3401-2023; wu, p/JDW-5015-2023; yang, peng/JEZ-8452-2023; WANG, YANG/JFA-8821-2023; li, qing/JEF-9044-2023; zhang, xu/JEO-4879-2023; li, jing/JEF-8436-2023; liu, xy/JEP-3175-2023; LI, XIAO/IQV-9318-2023; Liu, Jie/JCP-1070-2023; Chen, Yu/JLL-0171-2023; Wang, Chao/JHT-6081-2023; LU, Li/JFJ-9011-2023; Wang, lingyu/JLM-2013-2023; wang, chen/JED-7289-2023; JIN, LIYING/JFB-1980-2023; WANG, HUI/JFA-9683-2023; Jiang, Yuan/JED-3759-2023; Li, Yan/GQR-2606-2022; Zhang, Yun/JCN-7026-2023; liu, peng/JSL-1931-2023; Jiang, Yu/JEZ-9814-2023; li, xiang/JCN-9316-2023; wu, yi/JEP-1581-2023; Yang, Jing/JFK-4046-2023	Yang, Jing/0009-0004-8274-9863													1748-9326					APR 1	2023	18	4							044017	10.1088/1748-9326/acc3b0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/acc3b0													WOS:000951836700001

Monitoring dryland trees with remote sensing. Part B: Combining tree cover and plant architecture data to assess degradation and recovery of <i>Argania spinosa</i> woodlands of South Morocco	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												The argan woodlands of South Morocco represent an open-canopy dryland forest with traditional silvopastoral usage that includes browsing by goats, sheep and camels, oil production as well as agricultural use. In the past, these forests have undergone extensive clearing, but are now protected by the state. However, the remaining argan woodlands are still under pressure from intensive grazing and illegal firewood collection. Although the argan-forest area seems to be overall decreasing due to large forest clearings for intensive agriculture, little quantitative data is available on the dynamics and overall state of the remaining argan forest. To determine how the argan woodlands in the High Atlas and the Anti-Atlas had changed in tree-crown cover from 1972 to 2018 we used historical black and white HEXAGON satellite images as well as recent WorldView satellite images (see Part A of our study). Because tree shadows can oftentimes not be separated from the tree crown on panchromatic satellite images, individual trees were mapped in three size categories to determine if trees were unchanged, had decreased/increased in crown size or had disappeared or newly grown. The current state of the argan trees was evaluated by mapping tree architectures in the field. Tree-cover changes varied highly between the test sites. Trees that remained unchanged between 1972 and 2018 were in the majority, while tree mortality and tree establishment were nearly even. Small unchanged trees made up 48.4% of all remaining trees, of these 51% showed degraded tree architectures. 40% of small (re-) grown trees were so overbrowsed that they only appeared as bushes, while medium (3-7 m crown diameter) and large trees (> 7 m) showed less degraded trees regardless if they had changed or not. Approaches like grazing exclusion or cereal cultivation lead to a positive influence on tree architecture and less tree-cover decrease. Although the woodland was found to be mostly unchanged 1972-2018, the analysis of tree architecture reveals that a lot of (mostly small) trees remained stable but in a degraded state. This stability might be the result of the small trees' high degradation status and shows the heavy pressure on the argan forest.

J	Tonda, MM; Martín-Uceda, J				Tonda, Maria Marta; Martin-Uceda, Javier			Landscape intangible values: alternatives of territorial planning in dryland metropolitan borders (Mendoza, Argentina)	BOLETIN DE LA ASOCIACION DE GEOGRAFOS ESPANOLES												Latin American cities grow towards the peripheries, fragmenting the connector with its natural context. A representative case is the metropolitan area of Mendoza (Argentina), with more than 60% of the provincial population. Its foothills, between the western limit of the metropolitan conglomerate and the Andes, is one of the most studied ecosystems: due to its fragility and threat; and the functional, environmental and landscape importance. This research incorporates the landscape as a transversal element in the ordering of the foothills, mapping the intangible values of the landscape, generally excluded from the variables for territorial management. Based on principles of citizen science and participatory georeferenced mapping (PPGIS), this approach recovers the intangibles of the landscape, due to its ability to generate affective links between society and the environment. As a result, cartographies capable of spatializing the perceptual -emotional dimension of people can be obtained, to generate alternatives that allow them to be included as a management and planning tool in a landscape perspective.																			0212-9426	2605-3322					2023		98							3343	10.21138/bage.3343	http://dx.doi.org/10.21138/bage.3343													WOS:001092555700001

These aspirations include: increasing production of nutritious food; minimising risk and maximising resilience in response to climate variability, fluctuating markets and extreme weather events; minimising impacts on global warming by reducing emissions; efficiently using limited resources; minimising negative on-site and off-site impacts; preserving biodiversity on farm and in nature; and achieving positive social outcomes reflected in farmers' incomes (revenue and profit). Here we used cropping systems simulation to assess multiple (11) sustainability indicators for 26 crop rotations to quantify their sustainability throughout Australia's subtropical cropping zone. Results were first expressed via a series of maps quantifying the minimal environmental impacts of attributes such as N applied, N leached, runoff and GHG emissions of the 26 crop rotations while identifying the locations of the optimal rotation for each attribute. Inspection of these maps showed that different rotations were optimal, depending on both location and the attribute mapped. This observation demonstrated that an 11-way sustainability win-win across all attributes was not likely to happen anywhere in the cropping zone. However, rotations that minimised environmental impacts were often among the more profitable rotations. A more holistic visualisation of the sustainability of six contrasting sites, using sustainability polygons, confirmed that trade-offs between sustainability indicators are required and highlighted that cropping in different sites is inherently more or less sustainable, regardless of the rotations used. Given that trade-offs between the various sustainability attributes of crop rotations are unavoidable, we plotted trade-off charts to identify which rotations offer an efficient trade-off between profit and other sustainability indicators. We propose that these maps, sustainability polygons and trade-off charts can serve as boundary objects for discussions between stakeholders interested in achieving the sustainable intensification of cropping systems.

However, information is limited to which forage species and forage rotation system increases productivity the most in the central Great Plains. The objective of this research was to identify the productivity and nutritive value of forage sorghum [FS, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], winter triticale [WT, xTriticosecale Wittm. ex A. Camus (Secale x Triticum)], and spring triticale (ST) crop rotations in the central Great Plains. The study was conducted from 2008 through 2011 at Garden City, Jetmore, and Tribune, KS. The experimental design was a randomized completed block with four crop rotation treatments: continuous FS-FS, continuous WT-WT, annual double-crop WT/FS, and 2-yr, double-crop WT/FS-ST rotations. The annualized forage accumulation from WT/FS-ST rotation at Garden City, Jetmore, and Tribune were 30, 53, and 62% greater than annualized yields from the WT-WT rotation, respectively. The annualized forage accumulation from double crop WT/FS rotation were 55 and 148% greater than annualized forage accumulation from WT-WT rotation at Garden City and Jetmore. Overall productivity of a rotation was in the order WT/FS > WT/FS-ST or FS-FS > WT-WT. Despite its greater productivity, it was difficult to implement field operations (planting and harvesting) in the WT/FS rotation due to insufficient time in the growing season and because, often, there was little to no soil water available at planting. We concluded the WT/FS-ST rotation was less intense and more easily adoptable than the WT/FS rotation and has sufficient diversity to utilize resources better than continuous FS-FS or WT-WT rotations.

We collected field management, soil, and plant information from 78 fields in Shuiqing, 106 fields in Yongshou, and 120 fields in Qiujialing on China's Loess Plateau to explore limitations in wheat grain Zn and design alternative options to achieve the target grain Zn concentration (40 mg kg-1). The Shuiqing fields had an average grain yield of 5022 kg ha-1 and grain Zn concentration of 22.8 mg kg-1, with no fields achieving the target grain Zn concentration due to phosphorus (P) fertilizer overuse (254 kg P2O5 ha-1) and very low soil DTPA-Zn (0.23 mg kg-1). Two Yongshou fields reached the target grain Zn concentration but had 52.3%, 16.0%, and 51.4% lower average grain yield, P fertilizer rate, and soil Olsen-P, respectively, than other fields. The Qiujialing fields had an average grain Zn concentration of 34.8 mg kg-1, with 18.3% of fields >= 40 mg kg-1, of which 91% had soil DTPA-Zn >= 0.5 mg kg-1 and 45.2% higher grain Zn uptake than other fields due to newly released wheat cultivars, low P fertilizer rates, low soil Olsen-P, and high soil mineral nitrogen. In conclusion, a feasible framework for achieving the target grain Zn level would be using cultivars with high Zn uptake capacity, reducing P fertilizer use and soil Olsen-P, and improving soil available Zn in low Zn soils.

Climate change intensifies the conflicting water demands between people and the environment and highlights the importance of effective water resource management for achieving a balance between economic development and environmental protection. In 2008, Inner Mongolia, typical dryland in northern China, proposed strict regulations on water exploitation and utilization aimed at achieving sustainable development. Our study is the first to investigate the effectiveness and performance of these long-standing water conservation regulations. Our analyses found that the regulations drove industrial transformation, evidenced by the decreasing proportion of environmentally harmful industries such as coal and steel, and the increasing proportion of tertiary industries (especially tourism). Following industrial transformation, economic development decoupled from industrial water consumption and subsequently led to reduced negative environmental impacts. Based on these results, adaptive strategies were developed for 12 cities by revealing and integrating their development pathways and relative status in achieving sustainable development. Integration and cooperation between cities were proposed, e.g., a water trade agreement between eastern Inner Mongolia (an economically underdeveloped region with relatively abundant water resources) and central Inner Mongolia (an economically developed region with high water stress). Such an agreement may enable the holistic achievement of sustainable development across regions. By integrating the findings of our research, our study presents a reproducible framework for water-management-based sustainable development strategies in drylands.					liu, wen/HGE-3071-2022; Wang, Yanfen/IUM-5374-2023; Wang, Yanfen/C-6889-2013	Ding, Boyang/0009-0007-3623-7009													2095-2201	2095-221X				MAR	2022	16	3							28	10.1007/s11783-021-1462-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-021-1462-y													WOS:000669990200001
J	Everard, M				Everard, Mark			Can management of 'thirsty' alien trees improve water security in semi-arid India?	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Arid and semi-arid regions of central India receive scarce and episodic precipitation during the short monsoon season, and also experience substantial evaporation. Traditional and innovative water harvesting and governance practices improve water stewardship, or abate some impacts of intensive mechanised water extraction. However, significant numbers of alien trees, in particular Eucalyptus species with high water demands, populate some regions practicing progressive water stewardship. The water demands of these trees can potentially undermine efforts to achieve water security. Through interviews with community leaders in Indian villages with differing eucalyptus tree densities, water loss through evapotranspiration compared with livelihood demands was approximated. Literature review of the water demands and ecosystem services provided respectively by alien eucalypts and native, culturally valued neem trees supports assessment of the likely benefits and acceptability of a replacement programme favouring native trees. Although data limitations mean that the findings of this study are necessarily uncertain, they nonetheless illustrate the likely scale of impact, substantiating the case for alien tree management as an important contribution to water security. Alien vegetation management practices as a contribution to water security are already firmly established in South Africa, and are likely to yield equivalent benefits if translated to dryland India.

The Reliability and Validation of the Aquatic Movement Protocol as an Instrument for Assessing Aquatic Motor Competence in Primary Aged Children	JOURNAL OF MOTOR LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT												There is a dearth of research in aquatic motor competency, a key requirement for primary physical education in order to become physically literate. This study proposes a new assessment protocol for aquatic motor competence and sets out to examine the validity of the Aquatic Movement Protocol (AMP) in children between 7 and 9 years of age. Testing of Grass Motor Development-second edition was implemented to assess general motor competence, including a composite of 10-m running sprint time and standing long jump distance. Aquatic motor competence was assessed by the AMP. Univariate analyses of covariance were used to examine whether assessment of general motor competence differed as opposed to aquatic motor competence. Process and product measures of dryland motor competence were analyzed using male and female subjects measuring three aquatic motor competences (low, medium, and high). Cronbach's alpha and exploratory factor analyses were implemented to show both construct and concurrent validity of the AMP. Children classified as high for aquatic motor competence had significantly higher general motor competence (p = .001). Those who achieved a higher composite score for faster sprint speeds and longer jump distances had significantly higher aquatic motor competence (p = .001). Cronbach's alpha of .908, showed internal consistency of the AMP. Results extracted one factor from analysis with an eigenvalue = 6.2; %variance = 62.1, with loadings higher than 0.5. This data suggests that the items on the AMP measure a single construct that we would call "Aquatic Motor Competence." This study demonstrates that the AMP is a valid measure of aquatic motor competence in primary aged children.

Further, the amount of water that could have been saved if farmers would follow the planned area is unknown. In this study, water delivery performance was assessed by comparison of actual paddy rice planting and the government's planned conditions. For both conditions, performance indicators relating to adequacy, equity, and dependability were analyzed across six locations in conjunction with the branch canal water level in 2013 and 2014. Based on the difference between the actual water supply and planned water demand, the amount of water that could have been saved for downstream uses was calculated. The average adequacy for the investigation period was good at one location, fair at 2 locations, and poor at 3 locations in both years. Further, adequacy under both actual and planned conditions was poor in late July at all locations. The planned adequacy and dependability downstream and equity among locations improved compared to the actual condition in both years. Under the condition that paddy rice area is the upper limit planned by the government, about 12.3% and 9.6% of water could be potentially saved in each year. The difference between actual and planned water delivery performance is caused by the branch canal's low water level. Control of overplanting paddy rice and coordination of water distribution among water user associations would improve stable water level in the canal and, eventually, water delivery performance.

Over multiple years, the continuous planting of potatoes can lead to a decrease in both potato yield and soil quality. Crop rotation proves to be a viable solution for enhancing soil productivity, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. A 5-year field experiment was conducted in northwestern China's semi-arid region to evaluate the impact of different potato rotation treatments (1-year rotation with maize, 3-year rotation with maize, oil flax and broad bean; 2-year continuous potato planting rotated with maize and 5-year continuous potato planting) and mulching techniques (unmulched and plastic film) on potato yield and soil fertility. The results showed that crop rotation (1-year and 3-year) improved plant height, dry matter accumulation, soil quality, and reduced water footprint. Under plastic film mulching mode, 1-year rotation resulted in an increase in number of potatoes per plant by 38.24%, economic benefits by 9.70%, water use efficiency by 41.86 and soil fertility in comparison to the 5-year continuous planting, the tuber yield significantly increased by 78.86%, and the green/grey/total water footprint reduced by 28.8%-46.4%. We recommend the 1-year rotational cropping system using plastic film mulch as an effective technique for addressing the challenges of continuous potato cultivation in arid and semi-arid regions.																			0921-3449	1879-0658				OCT	2023	197								107114	10.1016/j.resconrec.2023.107114	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2023.107114		JUL 2023											WOS:001066063500001

H.			Path analysis of phenotypic factors associated with grain protein in dryland winter wheat	JOURNAL OF CROP IMPROVEMENT												In hard red winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), increased understanding of relationships between grain protein concentration (GPC) and other phenotypic traits is needed for simultaneously achieving high yield and GPC through genetic improvement and management. Two field experiments with 20 genotypes each were conducted in 2018/2019 in Uvalde and Chillicothe, TX. The primary objective was to assess direct and indirect effects of phenotypic traits on GPC using path analysis. Broad-sense heritability was high for grain yield but low for GPC, indicating that breeding selection for high yield is best done directly, but selection for elevated GPC may be approached indirectly. Grains m(-2) was positively related to GPC, though highly affected by environment, whereas 1000-kernel weight was negatively related to GPC and highly heritable. Heads m(-2) had a negative direct influence on GPC, but a positive indirect effect of head number on GPC through grain number indicated head number would positively impact GPC if additional heads increased grain number. There were conflicting results between locations on the relationship between aboveground biomass at anthesis and GPC, similar to other reports. Increased time to physiological maturity positively affected GPC, with time to anthesis being the primary offsetting indirect factor, meaning a longer grain-filling period can likewise increase GPC. Crop management practices can interact with these phenotypic factors to affect GPC, which is discussed herein. These findings provide novel information on direct and indirect effects of several phenotypic traits on GPC, giving insights into routes for improvement of wheat quality through breeding and management.

Little is known about the different roles of these two mechanisms in longterm crop breeding. A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the different effects of drought tolerance and avoidance mechanisms on the drought adaptation of wheat crops. The meta-analysis summarized the results of 283 published papers in international journals, and illustrated that primitive wheat genotypes, including wild, cultivated diploids, tetraploids and old hexaploids, preferentially showed a drought avoidance strategy, as evidenced by large root biomass, small leaf area, and reduced stomatal conductance under water deficits. Modern hexaploid genotypes showed stronger drought tolerance advantages, such as high leaf water potential and osmotic adjustment, with a small root system. The meta-analysis indicated that the breeding process of dryland wheat has been continuously enhancing drought tolerance while weakening drought avoidance. Under severe water deficits, old hexaploid wheat genotypes with drought avoidance characteristics showed lower reduction of aboveground biomass and yield than modern genotypes with stronger drought tolerance features, while under mild and moderate water deficits genotypes with stronger drought tolerance features had higher yields and aboveground biomass.

An experiment was conducted to study the performance of pearl millet under different technologies in 2013 and 2014 main cropping seasons at the main site of the research center, Aybra, with the objective of evaluating and identifying appropriate combinations of technologies that enhance the production of pearl millet in the study area. About fourteen integrated technologies were applied in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The analysis was done by using SAS software version 9.1, and means were separated through the Duncan multiple range test. Results of analysis of variance showed that yield-related traits of pearl millet were significantly influenced by the integration of technologies in the 2013 cropping season. According to the results, the maximum yield (3084 kg ha(-1)) was recorded with the application of the treatment combination of recommended fertilizer application + seed primming + tie ridging, while the minimum was recorded (919 kg ha(-1)) in the treatment combination of microdose application of fertilizer + primed seed + intercropping of pearl millet with mung bean. In the case of the 2014 cropping season, the highest grain yield (3687 kg ha(-1)) was recorded with the treatment combination of microdose fertilizer application + primed seed + tie ridging + intercropping of pearl millet with mung bean, whereas the lowest grain yield (2115 kg ha(-1)) was recorded in the treatment combination of no fertilizer application + primed seed + flat bed. Based on the results of the current investigation, it could be recommended that using technology integration of microdose, tied ridge, primed seed, and intercropping of pearl millet with mung bean is better to attain maximum yield in the study area and similar agroecologies.

However, few experimental studies have focused on effects of organic fertilizers on soil quality in a field ecosystem. The overarching goal of this study was to develop a soil quality index (SQI) for fertilization management in red soil farmland in China. The specific objectives were to determine 1) appropriate soil quality indicators, 2) a suitable weight assignment method (PCA, principal component analysis or MRA, multiple regression analysis) and 3) the optimal scoring function (standard or linear or non-linear). We analyzed 40 soil physical, chemical, biochemical and biological properties under nine fertilization treatments (CK (no fertilizer), CF (chemical fertilizer), RF (60% chemical fertilizer), CFS (chemical fertilizer + straw), RFS (60% chemical fertilizer + straw), CFB (chemical fertilizer + biochar), RFB (60% chemical fertilizer + biochar), RFP (60% chemical fertilizer + pig manure), RFV (60% chemical fertilizer + vermicompost)) as potential soil quality indicators. Principal component analysis and correlation analysis were applied to determine the indicators responsive to management and for the confirmation of the six SQIs. Available phosphorous, nitrogen, potassium and gram-positive bacteria were chosen as the minimum data set from the total of 40 soil indictors. Management of organic and inorganic fertilizers affected each soil property in different ways, and the index based on the minimum data set, calculated using standard scoring function and weight assignment method of multiple regression analysis, was most accurate and sensitive. Application of a pig manure or vermicompost significantly increased SQI values relative to other treatments, followed by straw or biochar treatments which were higher than a single application of chemical fertilizer. These results indicate that the addition of organic fertilizers will not only improve soil quality, but also enhance rapeseed and sweet potato yield compared to chemical fertilizers. Additionally, the SQI method can provide a practical and quantitative tool for the evaluation of soil quality.

Evapotranspiration partitioning in dryland ecosystems: A global meta-analysis of <i>in situ</i> studies	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In drylands, evapotranspiration (ET) is the dominant ecohydrologic process. For this reason, partitioning of ET-determining the relative importance of interception (I), soil evaporation (E), and plant transpiration (T)-is critical, but remains a challenge. Recently, however, advances in measurement technologies and data availability have triggered an upsurge in in situ studies focused on quantifying T/ET. We carried out a meta-analysis of 38 datasets drawn from 31 studies done in drylands worldwide. This analysis showed that over the growing season, E and T are roughly equivalent for most natural ecosystems, whereas T/ET is higher in irrigated agro-ecosystems. With respect to factors controlling variations in T/ET, we found (1) no clear correlation for annual precipitation, soil texture, or ecosystem type; (2) leaf area index is a more significant controlling factor than fractional cover; and (3) T/ET varies most during dynamic wetting-drying episodes. We also found that controlling factors are different for E and T. Because these two processes differ in temporal dynamics, the factors controlling ET partitioning vary with temporal scale. Further, when interception and shallow groundwater are substantial, including these factors is essential for accurate T/ET quantification. The isotopic approach, especially using laser spectroscopy, is now indispensable for such studies. However, issues related to sampling protocols and quality assurance still must be resolved. We propose three promising areas for future studies in drylands: (1) isotopic sampling of vadose-zone water vapor using laser spectroscopy; (2) improved definition/identification of diffusive pathways; and (3) robust upscaling from incongruent hydrometric and isotopic measurements.					sun, xiangmin/AAV-2275-2020; Sun, Xiangmin/AAI-1913-2020; Wilcox, Bradford/AAA-5561-2021; Zou, Chris/A-5039-2010	sun, xiangmin/0000-0002-5034-4392; Sun, Xiangmin/0000-0002-5034-4392; Wilcox, Bradford/0000-0002-3903-9098; Zou, Chris/0000-0003-0080-2866													0022-1694	1879-2707				SEP	2019	576						123	136		10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.06.022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.06.022													WOS:000486092200011

This study incorporated these methods to study the impacts of future climate on biomass production, crop development, lint yield, and water use efficiency in a Texas rainfed cotton system. Based on two-years of field data obtained from a rainfed cotton field (12 ha), APSIM accurately predicted cotton biomass and lint yield during the calibration (NRMSE: biomass, 17.6%; lint, 10.8%) and validation (NRMSE: biomass, 18.8%; lint, 13.1%) processes. The deviation between simulated and observed development stages as days after sowing was less than 6 days across squaring, flowering, and boll maturity stages. A partial least square model was constructed based on satellite NDVI data and development stage accurately predicted cotton biomass (R2 = 0.93, P < 0.05), and the results agreed well with the predicted values of APSIM (R2 = 0.96, P < 0.05), which was calibrated by the cotton biomass derived from NDVI. Decreased yield was detected in almost all RCP scenarios, with the greater reductions in end-century (29.9???82.4%) scenarios than mid-century (16.2???46.7%) scenarios. For precipitation productivity, 14???80.3% of reduction was found across all future scenarios. A great reduction in reliable yield (45.0???92.0%) and reliable precipitation productivity (37.6???84.7%) were projected by future scenarios. Slight differences were detected in model validation between the two dominant soil types present at the study location; however these differences were much greater under future projections (P < 0.05), largely caused by differences in water holding capacity during critical growth stages. The results from this study suggest that future managerial and breeding efforts that focus on water use efficiency enhancement should be promoted in the future. <comment>Superscript/Subscript Available</comment					李, 舟/GSN-8872-2022; Rajan, Nithya/N-1472-2014	李, 舟/0000-0002-1091-8865; 													0168-1923	1873-2240				OCT 15	2022	325								109148	10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.109148	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.109148		AUG 2022											WOS:000859538300003

This is a priority in the shrinking, seasonally dry forest of Berenty, a private reserve in Southern Madagascar. However, to provide a basis for forest restoration, a study of tree growth and regeneration in this unique biome is essential. A three-year planting program of native and endemic species was initiated in 2016. Three trial plots were established in forest gaps, with varying microclimates and soil conditions: one on the riverside, one in the mid-forest and the third in a degraded dryland area. We planted 1297 seedlings of 24 native tree species with plantings spaced at 1 m and 1.5 m and measured their height and stem diameters and recorded seedling mortality. We also recorded plant recruitment on the plots from the nearby forest. The main findings were that growth was best on the mid-forest plot planted at 1 m. Seedling mortality was highest on the riverside plot for the 1 m seedlings and least in the mid-forest at both planting distances. Recruitment was highest in the mid-forest at both planting distances and high also at 1.5 m by the river. These results are intended to aid future forest restoration on the Reserve and may serve as a reference for restoration of other dry forests in Madagascar. Finally, since species identification is central to the project, we collected, prepared and catalogued tree specimens to form a reference collection in an herbarium under construction in a new Research Centre at the reserve.

The cultivars introduced for the conventional systems may not be suitable under CA environments, and newly adapted cultivars need to be developed. Accordingly, four separate field experiments were conducted over two cropping seasons (2018-2019 and 2019-2020) to study the agronomic performance of seven barley genotypes under three tillage systems: conventional tillage (full tillage with residue removed), reduced tillage (chisel plowing with residue retained) and CA system (no tillage with residue retained on soil surface). The genotypes were grown under rainfed conditions in two different agro-ecological regions (Kamyaran and Hosseinabad locations) in the west of Iran. Significant genotypic differences were observed for grain yield and yield components except 1000-kernel weight. The results of this study showed that rainfed barley genotypes under a CA system produced yields equal to, or better (0.7%) than, the conventional tillage; while reduced tillage system decreased their performance by 4.9%. Regarding genotype x tillage interaction, the barley genotypes Catalhuyuk 2001 and Bulbule positively interacted with conventional tillage and showed higher performance than other genotypes, whereas genotypes cumra 2001, Ansar and Abidar expressed highest performance under CA system. Consequently, genotypes Bulbule, Catalhuyuk 2001 and Gumharriyet 50 outperformed the domestic performance and the amount of grain yield and showed the highest adaptation to the tested environments. The results of the present study could be useful to improve the efficiency of a CA system in rainfed cultivation of barley and open new windows for the cereal production in arid and semi-arid regions with food security concerns.

However, the combined effects of mulching type and planting density on maize growth and yield have been seldom studied, especially in different hydrological years. A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of mulching type and planting density on the soil temperature, growth, grain yield (GY), water use efficiency (WUE) and economic benefit of rainfed maize in the drylands of northern China during 2015-2017. Precipitation fluctuated over the three years. There were four mulching types (NM, flat cultivation with non-mulching; SM, flat cultivation with straw mulching; RP, plastic-mulched ridge plus bare furrow; RPFS, plastic-mulched ridge plus straw-mulched furrow) and three planting densities (LD, low planting density, 45.0x10(3) plants/hm(2); MD, medium planting density, 67.5x10(3) plants/hm(2); HD, high planting density, 90.0x10(3) plants/hm(2)). Results showed that soil temperature was higher with RP and lower with SM compared with NM, but no significant difference was found between RPFS and NM. More soil water was retained by soil mulching at the early growth stage, but it significantly varied at the middle and late growth stages. Maize growth was significantly improved by soil mulching. With increasing planting density, stem diameter, net photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content tended to decline, whereas a single-peak trend in biomass yield was observed. Mulching type and planting density did not have significant effect on evapotranspiration (ET), but GY and WUE were significantly affected. There were significant interacting effects of mulching type and planting density on biomass yield, GY, ET and WUE. Compared with NM, RPFS, RP and SM increased GY by 57.5%, 50.8% and 18.9%, and increased WUE by 66.6%, 54.3% and 18.1%, respectively. At MD, GY increased by 41.4% and 25.2%, and WUE increased by 38.6% and 22.4% compared with those of at LD and HD. The highest maize GY (7023.2 kg/hm(2)) was observed under MD+RPFS, but the value (6699.1 kg/hm(2)) was insignificant under MD+RP. Similar trends were observed for WUE under MD+RP and MD+RPFS, but no significant difference was observed between these two combinations. In terms of economic benefit, net income under MD+RP was the highest with a 9.8% increase compared with that of under MD+RPFS. Therefore, we concluded that RP cultivation pattern with a suitable planting density (67.5x10(3) plants/hm(2)) is promising for rainwater resources utilization and maize production in the drylands of northern China.

Soil loss is often nonlinear, involving a rapid deterioration from a stable eco-geomorphic state once a tipping point is reached. Soil loss thresholds have been studied at plot scale, but for landscapes, quantitative constraints on the necessary and sufficient conditions for tipping points are rare. Here, we document a landscape-wide eco-geomorphic tipping point at the edge of the Tibetan Plateau and quantify its drivers and erosional consequences. We show that in the upper Kali Gandaki valley, Nepal, soil formation prevailed under wetter conditions during much of the Holocene. Our data suggest that after a period of human pressure and declining vegetation cover, a 20% reduction of relative humidity and precipitation below 200 mm/year halted soil formation after 1.6 ka and promoted widespread gullying and rapid soil loss, with irreversible consequences for ecosystem services.

This research was needed to answer the economics of these various tillage systems and how the re-introduction of a single tillage changes the cost and revenue of long-term NT. An Economic analyses of these alternative tillage systems, based on long-term field research, is limited. The specific objective of this research was to quantify the relative eco-nomic advantages of various tillage systems (CT, RT, NT, and OT) in a wheat-sorghum-fallow (W-S-F) rotation in the central Great Plains. Results of two long-term field research studies conducted in western Kansas were used for this analysis. The first study was conducted from 2001 to 2018 to compare CT, RT, and NT systems and the second study from 2014 to 2018 at two locations to compare NT with OT. Results showed average NT sorghum yields were more than double the average yields of CT and 58 % greater than RT. There were no significant differences in wheat or sorghum yields between NT and OT. Total cost of production for the W-S-F system increased in the order NT>RT>CT. However, the NT system had the greatest average return, about $76 and $146 ha-1 greater than RT and CT, respectively. Net returns were not different between NT and OT. In support with our initial hypothesis, we concluded that a NT system has yield and profit advantages over RT and CT. And if a onetime OT is necessary in a long-term NT system, crop yields and return will not be significantly affected in the first 5 years after the OT.																			0167-1987	1879-3444				AUG	2023	232								105751	10.1016/j.still.2023.105751	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2023.105751		MAY 2023											WOS:001001282000001
J	Wasson, RJ; Weaver, DM				Wasson, Robert J.; Weaver, David M.			Sediment Budgets for Small Salinized Agricultural Catchments in Southwest Australia and Implications for Phosphorus Transport	WATER												Examples of sediment budgets are needed to document the range of budget types and their controls. Sediment budgets for three small agricultural catchments (7.6 to 15.6 km(2)) in southwestern Australia are dominated by channel and gully erosion, with sheet and rill erosion playing a subordinate role. Erosion was increased by clearing naturally swampy valley floors and hillslopes for agriculture and grazing, and episodic intense rainstorms. The proportion of sediment from channel and gully erosion in the sediment budget appears to be determined by the depth of alluvial fills. Dryland salinization caused by clearing native vegetation has connected hillslopes to channels across narrow floodplains, increasing the Sediment Delivery Ratio (SDR). Yield and SDR are found to be insensitive to major in-catchment changes of vegetation cover after initial clearing, the ratio of sheet and rill erosion/channel and gully erosion, and sediment storage masses. This supports the idea that yield alone is often a poor indicator of the impact of land use and land management change. Riparian vegetation would reduce sediment yield but not phosphorus yield. This study demonstrates the value of mixed methods where field observations and chemical analysis are combined with information from local people.

The data come from the Cretaceous paleosols of the Manlia Formation (Bauru Basin, SE Brazil), in which the T. barretti ichnofabric and rhizoliths represent the biotic record. Beetle larvae are considered to be the most likely T. barretti tracemakers in these paleosols. The intensity and recurrence of bioturbation suggest that the windows of opportunity for beetle population growth were very short and controlled by the pro-gressive substrate desiccation after flood cessation. The characteristics of the trace fossil assemblage suggest soil colonization by r-strategic organisms triggered by flooding events that provided the resource inputs necessary for their living during rainy seasons. The results also show that in fluvial systems with high discharge variations, the boundaries between a "pre-desiccation suite" and a "desiccation suite" in the Scoyenia ich-nofacies can be diffuse due to the short duration of colonization windows and progressive terrestrialization of floodplains and channels. Therefore, the frequency of flooding events, the lowered water table, and the rapidity of substrate desiccation constrained colonization by other burrowers and may be considered as first -order factors controlling the generation of a monotypic T. barretti ichnofabric. Thus, the monotypic Taenidium ichnofabric in the Scoyenia ichnofacies context is an ichnomarker of brief windows for colonization in highly seasonal environments.

Landsat images were used in the years 1985, 1989, 1993, 1997, 2001, 2005, 2009, 2014, and 2019, and the classes were broken down into areas: water, exposed soil, agriculture, and forestry, and using the Bhattacharya classifier, the classification was carried out for generating land use maps. The data was validated by the Kappa index and points collected in the field, and the projection of the dynamics of use for 2024 was constructed. The thematic maps of land use and coverage from 1985 to 2019 show more significant changes in the forest and exposed soil classes. The increase in the forest class and the consequent reduction in exposed soil are consequences of the interaction between climate and human activities and the quality of the spatial resolution of the satellite images used between the years analyzed.

In farmland, microbes in soils are affected by exogenous carbon, nitro-gen, and soil depth and are responsible for soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization. The cherry industry has been evolving rapidly in northwest China and emerged as a new source of income for local farmers to overcome poverty. Accordingly, it is highly imperative to probe the effect of defoliation and nitrogen addition on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and microbial communities in soils of dryland cherry orchards.Methods. CO2 emissions and microbial communities were determined in soil samples at three depths, including 0-10 cm, 10-30 cm, and 30-60 cm, from a 15-year-old rain-fed cherry orchard. The samples were respectively incubated with or without 1% defoliation under three input levels of nitrogen (0 mg kg-1, 90 mg kg-1, and 135 mg kg-1) at 25 degrees C in the dark for 80 days.Results. Defoliation and nitrogen addition affected CO2 emissions and microbial communities and increased microbial biomass carbon (MBC), the activity of soil catalase, alkaline phosphatase, and cellulase in soils of the dryland cherry orchard. The culture with defoliation significantly promoted CO2 emissions in soils at the three depths mainly by increasing the MBC, catalase, alkaline phosphatase, and cellulase activities, resulted in positive priming index. Nitrogen addition elevated the MBC and changed soil enzymes and reduced CO2 emissions in soils at the three depths. Moreover, the priming index was higher in deep soils than in top and middle soils under the condition of defoliation and nitrogen addition. No significant differences were observed in the soil bacterial diversity (Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson) among all treatments. Meanwhile, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was markedly increased and that of Acidobacteria was substantially diminished in soils at the three depths by defoliation and nitrogen addition. The results sustained that defoliation and nitrogen can regulate SOC dynamics by directly and indirectly affecting soil microbial activities and communities. As a result, the combination of defoliation return and nitrogen fertilization management is a promising strategy to increase SOC and promote soil quality in dryland cherry orchards.																			2167-8359					MAY 8	2023	11								e15276	10.7717/peerj.15276	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.15276								37180582					WOS:000996190800002

However, the combined effects of mulching type and planting density on maize growth and yield have been seldom studied, especially in different hydrological years. A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of mulching type and planting density on the soil temperature, growth, grain yield (GY), water use efficiency (WUE) and economic benefit of rainfed maize in the drylands of northern China during 2015-2017. Precipitation fluctuated over the three years. There were four mulching types (NM, flat cultivation with non-mulching; SM, flat cultivation with straw mulching; RP, plastic-mulched ridge plus bare furrow; RPFS, plastic-mulched ridge plus straw-mulched furrow) and three planting densities (LD, low planting density, 45.0x10(3) plants/hm(2); MD, medium planting density, 67.5x10(3) plants/hm(2); HD, high planting density, 90.0x10(3) plants/hm(2)). Results showed that soil temperature was higher with RP and lower with SM compared with NM, but no significant difference was found between RPFS and NM. More soil water was retained by soil mulching at the early growth stage, but it significantly varied at the middle and late growth stages. Maize growth was significantly improved by soil mulching. With increasing planting density, stem diameter, net photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content tended to decline, whereas a single-peak trend in biomass yield was observed. Mulching type and planting density did not have significant effect on evapotranspiration (ET), but GY and WUE were significantly affected. There were significant interacting effects of mulching type and planting density on biomass yield, GY, ET and WUE. Compared with NM, RPFS, RP and SM increased GY by 57.5%, 50.8% and 18.9%, and increased WUE by 66.6%, 54.3% and 18.1%, respectively. At MD, GY increased by 41.4% and 25.2%, and WUE increased by 38.6% and 22.4% compared with those of at LD and HD. The highest maize GY was observed under MD+RPFS (7023.2 kg/hm(2)), but the value was insignificant under MD+RP (6699.1 kg/hm(2)). Similar trends were observed for WUE under MD+RP and MD+RPFS, but no significant difference was observed between these two combinations. In terms of economic benefit, net income under MD+RP was the highest with a 9.8% increase compared with that of under MD+RPFS. Therefore, we concluded that RP cultivation pattern with a suitable planting density (67.5x10(3) plants/hm(2)) is promising for rainwater resources utilization and maize production in the drylands of northern China.

Detailed plant characteristics can be used to indicate lodging risk; however, such measurements are destructive and time-consuming for projects that are not focused solely on evaluating lodging. The Stalker, a push force meter, can be used nondestructively to rapidly indicate stem strength and elasticity, which may be useful for measuring lodging risk in small-plot research to indicate both root and shoot lodging. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of the Stalker to detect agronomic management practices that are known to reduce lodging risk (reduced plant density, split nitrogen applications, and plant growth regulator applications). Stalk strength (resisting force) and elasticity (spike displacement, energy, and power) measurements were taken at anthesis and physiological maturity in a small-plot agronomic research trial. The Stalker was able to identify practices with high and low lodging risk. Lower plant density led to increased stem strength (measured by resisting force) and stem flexibility (measured by spike displacement) compared with high plant densities, indicating a decreased risk of both stem and root lodging when low plant densities were used. Overall, the Stalker is a new tool for rapid and nondestructive measurements of lodging risk in small-plot agronomic research trials and can indicate both stem and root lodging risk by measuring indicators of both stem strength and elasticity.

Increasing sensitivity of dryland vegetation greenness to precipitation due to rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Water availability plays a critical role in shaping terrestrial ecosystems, particularly in low- and mid-latitude regions. The sensitivity of vegetation growth to precipitation strongly regulates global vegetation dynamics and their responses to drought, yet sensitivity changes in response to climate change remain poorly understood. Here we use long-term satellite observations combined with a dynamic statistical learning approach to examine changes in the sensitivity of vegetation greenness to precipitation over the past four decades. We observe a robust increase in precipitation sensitivity (0.624% yr(-1)) for drylands, and a decrease (-0.618% yr(-1)) for wet regions. Using model simulations, we show that the contrasting trends between dry and wet regions are caused by elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)). eCO(2) universally decreases the precipitation sensitivity by reducing leaf-level transpiration, particularly in wet regions. However, in drylands, this leaf-level transpiration reduction is overridden at the canopy scale by a large proportional increase in leaf area. The increased sensitivity for global drylands implies a potential decrease in ecosystem stability and greater impacts of droughts in these vulnerable ecosystems under continued global change. Changes in vegetation responses to precipitation may be hydroclimate dependent. Here the authors reveal contrasting trends of vegetation sensitivity to precipitation in drylands vs. wetter ecosystems over the last 4 decades and identify increased CO2 as a major contributing factor.

To guide the integrated forest-water management at stand level, a study on the response of water yield from larch (Larix principis-rupprechtii) plantations to key stand structure and site factors was carried out in the Liupan Mountains. Models of leaf area index (LAI) of forest canopy and stand evapotranspiration (ET) in the growing season were developed and fitted. The growing season water yield was calculated based on water budget. The results showed that: (1) The LAI increases with rising tree density firstly quickly and then slowly and finally tending to its maximum; but firstly increases and then decreases with rising tree age and elevation. The LAI model coupling the effects of tree density, age, and elevation works well. (2) The ET model reflecting the coupled effects of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, LAI and soil moisture can well predict the ET variation. (3) The water yield decreases gradually with rising tree density, but firstly decreases and then increases with rising tree age and elevation. The lowest water yield appears at the age of 30 years and at an elevation of 2420 m. (4) The implications of this study for integrated forest-water management are: defining water yield as the dominant forest service at high or low elevations, but quality timber production as the dominant service at medium elevations; arranging rational thinning for dense forests around the age of 30 years; designing a mosaic distribution of forest ages within watersheds. Applying the study outcomes can promote the integration of water yield management with traditional forest management to ensure the sustainability of water supply in dryland regions.

Hydrological and productive impacts of recent land-use and land-cover changes in the semiarid Chaco: Understanding novel water excess in water scarce farmlands	ECOHYDROLOGY												Over the last decades, the rapid replacement of native forests by crops and pastures in the Argentinean semiarid Chaco plains has triggered unprecedented groundwater level raises resulting from deep drainage increases, leading to the first massive waterlogging event on records (similar to 25,000 Ha flooded in 2015 near Bandera, one of the most cultivated clusters of the Chaco). In this paper, we link this episode to the ongoing deforestation and cropping scheme shifts through the combined analysis of remote sensing data, agricultural surveys, local farmer information and hydrologic modelling. From 2000 to 2015, the agricultural area of Bandera increased from 21% to 50%, mostly at the expense of dry forests. In this period, agriculture migrated from more intensive (i.e., double-cropping) to more water-conservative (i.e., late-summer single crops) schemes as a general strategy to reduce drought risks. These changes reduced regional evapotranspiration and increased the intensity of deep drainage in wet years. Contrasting cropping schemes displayed significant evapotranspiration differences, but all of them experienced substantial drainage losses (similar to 100-200 mm) during the wettest year (2014/2015), suggesting that cropping adjustments have a limited capacity to halt the generation of water excesses. Nearly 50% of the cropped area in Bandera could not be sown or harvested following the groundwater recharge event of 2014/2015. In the ongoing context of shallow and rising water tables, the introduction of novel cropping schemes that include deep-rooted perennials, to promote transpirative groundwater discharge, seems crucial to avoid the recurrence of water excesses and their associated dryland salinity risk in the region.

Biological invasions and climate change amplify each other's effects on dryland degradation	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Climate models predict that, in the coming decades, many arid regions will experience increasingly hot conditions and will be affected more frequently by drought. These regions are also experiencing rapid vegetation change, notably invasion by exotic grasses. Invasive grasses spread rapidly into native desert ecosystems due, in particular, to interannual variability in precipitation and periodic fires. The resultant destruction of non-fire-adapted native shrub and grass communities and of the inherent soil resource heterogeneity can yield invader-dominated grasslands. Moreover, recurrent droughts are expected to cause widespread physiological stress and mortality of both invasive and native plants, as well as the loss of soil resources. However, the magnitude of these effects may differ between invasive and native grasses, especially under warmer conditions, rendering the trajectory of vegetated communities uncertain. Using the Biosphere 2 facility in the Sonoran Desert, we evaluated the viability of these hypothesized relationships by simulating combinations of drought and elevated temperature (+5 degrees C) and assessing the ecophysiological and mortality responses of both a dominant invasive grass (Pennisetum ciliare or buffelgrass) and a dominant native grass (Heteropogan contortus or tanglehead). While both grasses survived protracted drought at ambient temperatures by inducing dormancy, drought under warmed conditions exceeded the tolerance limits of the native species, resulting in greater and more rapid mortality than exhibited by the invasive. Thus, two major drivers of global environmental change, biological invasion and climate change, can be expected to synergistically accelerate ecosystem degradation unless large-scale interventions are enacted.

Here, we obtained a record of sediment grain size from Tolbo Lake in western Mongolia to reconstruct changes in aeolian activity since similar to 14 ka. The results suggest that intensified aeolian activity in the late Holocene may mainly have been a response to stronger surface winds resulting from an increase in spring insolation and mountain snow. The stable weak aeolian activity appears to coincide with ice-rafting events in the North Atlantic during the middle Holocene and may be a response to warming at northern high latitudes, increased humidity and vegetation coverage in western Mongolia, indicating that dust from western Mongolia would possibly contribute minimally to dust deposition in Greenland during this period.

Are microbial communities indicators of soil health in a dryland wheat cropping system?	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												Soil health is an increasingly important concept that provides aspirational targets for agricultural management. Due in part to the incredible diversity of soil microbial communities, however, the biological components of soil health remain poorly understood. In the last decade the refinement of high-throughput DNA sequencing approaches for examining soil microbial communities has led to sequence-variant resolution insights into their diversity. In this work we employ high-throughput sequencing of bacterial (16S rRNA genes) and fungal (internal transcribed spacer [ITS]) regions to evaluate soil microbial communities in relation to other soil chemical parameters, biological soil health tests, and crop yields in fields under long-term reduced tillage (business-as-usual) and no tillage (aspirational) management at two soil depths. We found that tillage systems and soil depth were crucial determinants of microbial community composition and diversity in conjunction with soil chemical measures. Moreover, although some measures of biological soil health (CO2-burst, Haney Soil Health Score) did not differentiate fields under reduced tillage and no-till systems, amplicon sequencing revealed clear differences in microbial communities between management regimes. The relative abundances of many microbial taxa were significantly related to soil chemical variables and crop yields. Fungal communities showed stronger correlations with yield than bacterial communities at both depth increments. Fungi from the families Sordariaceae, Hydnodontaceae, Hypocreaceae, and Clavicipitaceae were positively correlated with yield, especially in the upper soil depth, while Glomeraceae and Phaeosphaeriaceae were negatively correlated. Many of these correlations were also seen in the subsequent winter wheat and chickpea crops, and some correlations could be detected in the 20-year previous yield history of the no-tillage farm. Among the bacteria, only Microbaceriaceae and Xanthomonadaceae were positively correlated, but Caulobacteriaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, Sphingobacteriaceae, Chitinophagaceae were more abundant in lower yielding locations. This may reflect the strong plant selection in the rhizosphere for these bacterial groups in stressed plants. There were no significant differences, however, between microbial diversity and management practices or significant correlations with crop yields. These results suggest that some specific groups of microbial taxa are responsive to tillage systems, exhibit positive relationships with grain yields, and may be useful indicators of soil health.

In addition, the nitrogen use efficiency is low in this area because nutrient availability is affected by drought. As a result, rainwater storage during the summer fallow season is very important to increasing nitrogen use efficiency, and to the stable production of dryland wheat in the Loess Plateau. Methods: A 3-year field experiment in the eastern part of the Loess Plateau was conducted with two tillage methods (no tillage (NT) and deep ploughing (DP)) and five N rates (0, 120, 150, 180, and 210 kg N ha-1) to study the effect of tillage on soil water utilization, plant nitrogen utilization, and wheat yield.Result: Compared to NT, DP showed a larger increase in soil water storage (SWSf) and precipitation storage efficiency (PSEf) during the two dry summer fallow seasons than in the normal summer fallow season. DP substantially increased the pre-anthesis soil water consumption (SWCpre) and N translocation. The average yield under DP was 12.46% and 14.92-18.29% higher than under NT in the normal and dry seasons, respectively. A 1 mm increase in SWCpre could increase grain yield by 25.28 kg ha-1, water use efficiency (WUE) by 0.069 kg ha-1 mm-1, and nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUtE) by 0.029 kg kg-1. DP could reduce the N rate by 11.49-53.34% in the normal seasons and 40.97-65.07% in the dry seasons compared to the same highest point of yield, WUE, and NUtE under NT.Conclusion: Deep ploughing in the summer fallow season, paired with optimized N application, could help increase wheat yield and nitrogen efficiency in dryland.

J	Ma, XZ; Wang, XP; Xiong, WH				Ma, Xiong-Zhong; Wang, Xin-Ping; Xiong, Wei-Hong			Fine-root turnover and leaf litterfall of <i>Salsola passerina</i> facilitate soil restoration in Alxa steppe desert of northwest China	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Nutrient cycling in desert ecosystems is heavily reliant on the fine root turnover and litter decomposition processes of dominant plant species. Based on field investigations and laboratory experiments, we explored fine root production (FRP) and turnover of Salsola passerina in Alxa steppe desert, and assessed fine root and leaf litter input and its correlation with soil C and N stocks, and then compared the variability of soil physicochemical properties at the site below and the interspace of S. passerina canopy. Results showed that fine root biomass dynamics of S. passerina were consistent with soil water content. Annual FRP of S. passerina was 243.3 g m(-2) yr(-1) and the turnover rate was 2.0 per year. S. passerina contributed 172.2 g Cm-2 and 6.8 g N m(-2) to soil from its fine root senescence and leaf litter input annually. Compared to the canopy interspace, the soil texture and fertility beneath the shrubs significantly improved, while the soil salinity decreased. The results indicated that the activities of desert shrub growth provided the degraded soil with abundant nutrients through fine root turnover and litter decomposition processes, which promoted soil texture and nutrition heterogeneity at the stand scale, and played an important role in degraded dryland restoration.																			1061-2971	1526-100X				2023 OCT 12	2023										10.1111/rec.14040	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.14040		OCT 2023											WOS:001084007400001
J	Garba, II; Williams, A				Garba, Ismail Ibrahim; Williams, Alwyn			Integrating Diverse Cover Crops for Fallow Replacement in a Subtropical Dryland: Implications on Subsequent Cash Crop Yield, Grain Quality, and Gross Margins	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Integrating cover cropping into crop-fallow rotation has been considered a key component of ecological intensification that could mitigate negative productivity and sustainability challenges associated with conventional fallow practices. However, the adoption of cover crops in water-limited environments has been limited by potential soil water and nitrogen (N) costs and resulting yield penalties. We examined the impacts of diverse cover crops on fallow soil water and mineral N dynamics and the legacy impacts on subsequent cash crop productivity and profitability. The cover crops used (forage oat-Avena sativa L. [grass], common vetch-Vicia sativa subsp. sativa L.)/fababean-Vicia faba L. [legume], forage rape-Brassica napus L. [brassica]) differed in functional traits related to growth, phenology, and soil water and N acquisition and use strategies. We found that grass-associated cover crops generally supported higher cash crop grain yield and profit than brassica- or legume-associated cover crops, mainly due to moderate biomass accumulation and water use and persistent groundcover. Cash crop grain yields increased by +19% and +23% following forage oat cover crop, with concomitant gains in gross margins of +96$ ha(-1) and +318$ ha(-1) for maize and winter wheat compared to conventional fallow. In contrast, maize grain yield following brassica-associated cover crops ranged from +8 to -21% and reduced gross margins by -229 to -686$ ha(-1) relative to conventional fallow. Legume- and brassica-associated cover crops had the lowest mungbean and winter wheat grain yield and gross margins compared to conventional fallow and the added stubble. Cash crop yields were related to cover crop biomass production, biomass N accumulation, residue carbon to N ratio, and legacy impacts through effects on soil water availability at cash crop sowing. Given the additional grain yield and gross margin benefits following grass-associated cover crops, they may provide a potential alternative fallow soil water and N management option that could improve crop productivity and cropping system resilience in water-limited environments.

In this study, we used 93 samples from the surface layer of soils located in tropical drylands in northeastern Brazil, to estimate the effects of climate, land use, parent material, topography and altitude on soil P availability. Our results indicated that the climate affected the availability of P in the soil by its effect in the dynamics of pH values. The increase in pH values in the most arid environments explained 21.9% of the increase in P availability in the soils. We observed that the P available content in soils originated from river sediments was 286, 202 and 168% higher than those found in soils from sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic rocks, respectively. We observed that agricultural cultivation (>20 years) and pasture (>20 years) increased the available P content in the soil by 60 and 51%, respectively, when compared to the reference native forest. We observed that soils located in flat and gently wavy topography had the highest contents of P. The results of our study can be useful for the sustainable use of soils in tropical drylands.

Black Placemaking under Environmental Stressors Dryland Farming in the Arid Black Pacific, 1890-1930	ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIETY-ADVANCES IN RESEARCH												Dry farming, or techniques of cultivating crops in regions with domineering dry seasons, was central to Black agricultural life across the Black diaspora, but especially in the Black Pacific. Ecologically, the Black diaspora transformed semi-arid ecosystems in both the Atlantic and Pacific. However, there is a dearth of Black narratives that draw on the ecological and botanical relationships held with the land. Through a collaborative botanical and historical approach that blends historical ecology and botany, we evaluate how Black placemaking occurred despite arid climatic stressors and as a result of ecological and cultural knowledge systems. Highlighting Black agricultural life in Costa Chica, Mexico and Blackdom, New Mexico, we argue that people and plants made cimarronaje (or collective and situated Black placemaking) possible in the Western coasts and deserts of Mexico and New Mexico through botanical knowledge systems of retaining water and cultivating a life in water-scarce environments.																			2150-6779	2150-6787				SEP	2022	13	1					121	139		10.3167/ares.2022.130108	http://dx.doi.org/10.3167/ares.2022.130108													WOS:000849090800008

Exploring these links in desert fluvial landscapes would augment our understanding of watershed biogeochemistry and river morphogenesis on early Earth (i.e. prior to the greening of landmasses). Accordingly, we analyse the Mojave River (California), one of the largest watercourses in the Great Basin of the western United States. We integrate discharge records with channel-migration rates derived from dynamic time-warping analysis and chronologically calibrated subsidence rates, thereby constraining the river's formative conditions. Our results reveal a slight downstream decrease in bankfull discharge on the Mojave River, rather than the downstream increase typically exhibited by perennial streams. Yet, the number of days per year during which the channel experiences bankfull or higher stages is roughly maintained along the river's length. Analysis of historical peak flood records suggests that the incidence of channel-formative events responds to modulation in watershed runoff due to the precipitation in the river's headwaters over decades to centuries. Our integrated analysis finally suggests that, while maintaining hydraulic geometries that are fully comparable with many other rivers worldwide, ephemeral desert rivers akin to the Mojave are capable of generating a surprisingly wide range of depositional geometries in the stratigraphic record.

The use of drought-resistant clones allows mitigating the negative effects of water deficit on the establishment and the productivity of unstable irrigated plantations in dryland areas. We evaluated the responses of four Populus x canadensis ('Conti 12', 'Guardi', 'I-214' and 'I45/51') and four Populus deltoides ('Stoneville 67', 'Catfish 2', 'Dvina' and 'Australiano 129/60') clones to a short-term water stress. Three water treatments were imposed on 6-month-old plants: well-watered (WW), 5 days of irrigation withdrawal followed by rewatering (-5 + RW), and 9 days of irrigation withdrawal followed by rewatering (-9 + RW). Populus clones presented different strategies to face water deficit, resulting in variable effects on plant growth. The small-leaved clone 'Australiano 129/60' showed strong stomatal control and maintained a high increase in leaf area during the water-shortage period. These strategies were associated with high relative growth under both water-shortage treatments. 'Australiano 129/60' showed to be a drought-resistant clone with the highest growth under both water-shortage treatments, appearing to be a promising clone for production in environments prone to short-term water stress.																			0169-4286	1573-5095				MAY	2023	54	3					421	437		10.1007/s11056-022-09929-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11056-022-09929-7		JUL 2022											WOS:000819308400001

Long-term relationships between seed bank communities and wildfire across four North American desert sites	ECOSPHERE												It is well documented that the recovery of dryland plant communities following wildfire can be variable, and that legacies of fire can have long-lasting effects on aboveground plant communities. However, our understanding of the degree to which dryland soil seed banks, or the viable seeds in situ, are impacted by fire and their subsequent postfire succession remains extremely poor. To address this important knowledge gap, we used a time-since-fire approach to investigate soil seed bank community changes approximately 15 and 30 years after wildfire and to determine the influence of microsites (e.g., shrub vs. interspace) on seed bank composition. We assessed soil seed bank metrics across four North American deserts, including two cold desert sites (Colorado Plateau and Great Basin) and two warm desert sites (Chihuahuan and Sonoran). In greenhouse emergence trials, we found that seed bank characteristics diverged between warm and cold desert sites, such that warm desert sites had seed banks dominated by annual plants while our cold desert sites had seed banks with greater proportions of perennial species, regardless of fire history. In cold desert sites, fire significantly altered seed bank species composition even 30 years after fire. Shrub versus interspace microsites had no observed influence on seed bank composition in any desert. However, seed bank species richness was greater under shrubs in both warm deserts. Non-native species were present in the seed banks of all deserts and some were particularly abundant in the burned sites. Despite the presence of native species in both burned and unburned seed banks, the presence of non-native species suggests some degree of vulnerability to future disturbances because fire can create amplifying feedback with many non-native plants. Our results highlight strong differences in fires' relationship with seed banks for warm and cold desert sites and lend insight into how fire relates to the composition and diversity of the seeds that play a fundamental role in future plant communities.																			2150-8925					MAR	2023	14	3							e4398	10.1002/ecs2.4398	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4398													WOS:000958704500001

Kunth (= Stipa tenacissima L.), also defined as Alpha grass steppes, form the main dryland ecosystems throughout the Mediterranean region. Recent studies suggest that ongoing climate change will lead to a sequence of changes in them, including modifications in the composition of vegetation and reduction in vegetation cover and biomass, which will diminish plant-derived organic inputs into the soil. These changes are expected to affect the spatial arrangement of vegetation and the ecosystem's water-nutrient balance, as well as the microbial populations in the underlying soil. In addition, the lithological legacy affecting soil hydrological properties might modulate the effects of aridity.Objectives With this study, we wanted to evaluate the interactive effects of the lithological legacy on soil water availability and aridification on vegetation cover, spatial structure, and composition, and on soil microbial biomass.Methods We combined field data, including plant composition and soil physicochemical and biological properties, with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images collected at eight study sites along two different altitudinal-aridity gradients with contrasting lithologies in a space-for-time substitution approach to explain the role of lithological legacies on soil properties in aridification. High-resolution UAV images were used to determine the vegetation cover and three spatial metrics related with the hydrological connectivity within the study areas. Soil microbial biomass was estimated using the substrate-induced respiration method.Results Aridification was critical to explaining changes in vegetation coverage, diversity, richness, and spatial distribution, reducing plant cover, and promoting dominance of small round isolated vegetation patches. By modulating soil physicochemical properties, lithology interacted with aridity controlling the variations in plant composition and the changes in soil microbial biomass along the altitudinal aridity gradients. This may have also affected nutrient cycling, thus determining the response of the ecosystem to aridification.Conclusion According to our results, the effect of the lithology legacy on soil properties interacts with aridity, determining the response of M. tenacissima steppes to aridification, as it modifies water availability on soil and plant composition, leading to differences in microbial biomass. Thus, both factors should be considered in the development of management strategies aimed for reducing and mitigating the negative impacts of climate change and aridification in drylands.

Flash flaming is a valid seed enhancement for a diverse range of species and seed morphologies	SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Flash flaming has shown promise as a seed enhancement technology that improves the handling properties of bulky or irregularly shaped seed material, which in turn benefits logistical and ecological aspects of large-scale direct seeding. To date, only a small number of grass species, that possess similar morphological characteristics, have been tested. This paper describes the application of flash flaming to diaspores (i.e. the dispersal unit comprising the seed and any surrounding or attached tissues) of 19 diverse dryland species from the Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae, Chenopodiaceae and Poaceae critical to ecological restoration in the mining intensive Pilbara region of Western Australia. Flash flaming parameters for each species were tested to identify and maximise volume and mass reduction, reduce particle cohesiveness and maximise flow through a mechanical seeding device, whilst maximising germination. Flaming of all species resulted in reductions in batch volume and mass, and improvements to flow characteristics. For 17 species, flaming either benefited or did not impact on germinability. For two species in the Amaranthaceae, flaming with the settings tested here resulted in a reduction in germinability; however, flaming enabled the diaspores to pass through a mechanical seeding device enabling mechanical distribution which is critical if the species are to be used in large scale restoration.

J	Lu, D; Lu, YH				Lu, Da; Lu, Yihe			Spatiotemporal variability of water ecosystem services can be effectively quantified by a composite indicator approach	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Ecological restoration will be promoted globally as a strategic solution supporting the relevant sustainable development goals including land degradation neutrality. However, this restorative approach is facing challenges from climate change and anthropogenic land-use change. One of these acute challenges is to balance ecological restoration and water ecosystem services particularly in dryland areas that are the most vulnerable to land degradation and climate change. Therefore, it is critical to understand the spatiotemporal variability of water ecosystem services in a changing environment on a regional scale. To gain this understanding, this paper formulates a composite indicator approach by integrating gross primary productivity (GPP) and waterbodies derived from remote sensing with key soil, climate, and topographic variables. The water ecosystem service index (WESI) was quantified in 10 watersheds of the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) region during 2000-2018 and found to be correlated positively with the surface runoff of these watersheds at high confidence levels. Then WESI is used in the whole CLP. The results of WESI indicate that about 90% of the CLP is low in water ecosystem services and about 45% of the CLP experienced significant increases for water ecosystem services under the impacts of large scale vegetation restoration, climate change, and land-use change. The WESI approach provides an efficient alternative to the complex modelling approaches that need much more ground based monitoring data. The WESI is useful for mapping the spatial pattern and temporal trends of regional water ecosystem services that are critical for ecological restoration and land-use planning in a changing environment.						lv, da/0000-0002-5919-5231													1470-160X	1872-7034				NOV	2021	130								108061	10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108061	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108061		AUG 2021											WOS:000692561800002

However, there is limited understanding of the impacts of ST on soil microbiome and their associated soil processes, particularly in dryland agriculture. This study aims to quantify the effect of one-off ST - after three years - on soil microbiomes and functions in a long-term no-till farming system under crop stubble and fertilizer management practices. The results showed that ST had marginal effects on microbial richness and diversity, enzyme activities, and catabolic function, but significantly affected the abundance of some microbial taxa (Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Verrucomicmbia, Basidiomycota and Ascomycota) that are relevant to carbon (C) degradation. Stubble retention, regardless of tillage and fertilizer management, mainly increased the abundance of copiotrophs such as Proteobacteria (e.g., Rhizobiales) and Actinobacteria (e.g., Streptomyces and Micromonosporaceae), and affected Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Among the management practices, stubble retention was the main factor that contributed to increased richness and diversity of the soil bacterial and fungal community. Supplementary fertilizer application, regardless of tillage and stubble management had minimal impact on bacterial and fungal richness and diversity, enzyme activity and catabolic function. The variation in bacterial community structure was influenced mainly by soil pH (c.a. 10%), while only a small but significant effect (< 7%; P = 0.001) was attributed to tillage and stubble management. Wheat grain yields ranged between 5 and 5.3 t ha(-1) and were not affected by tillage, stubble, nor fertilizer management practices. Similarly, these management practices did not influence total soil C or nitrogen concentrations. Our findings show that strategic tillage, when used to address specific constraints in no-till systems in dryland agriculture, does not have a significant effect on total soil C, microbial ecology nor catabolic function.

Moreover, systematic research on carbon (C) sequestration, SOC pools, their sensitivity to management change and critical C input level for zero change in SOC, especially under cotton-greengram intercropping in Vertisols of semi-arid climates, is limited. Therefore, we studied cotton-greengram intercropping after 35 years (1987-2022) under continuous application of organics (farmyard manure/gliricidia), chemical fertilizers and substitution of 50% or 100% fertilizer nitrogen (N) through farmyard manure/gliricidia (integrated nutrient management) (INM). The INM treatments recorded significantly higher cotton-greengram system productivity and sustainable yield index. Continuous cropping without an external nutrient source decreased the soil C, while cropping with INM resulted in a positive build-up of C in both labile and stable pools. On average, about 62% of total organic carbon was stabilized in the passive pool (C-LL, Less Labile C + C-RC, Recalcitrant C) of SOC. The increment in SOC stock was linearly (y = 0.0767x - 0.2248; R-2 = 0.87, p < .001) related to the system productivity. The very labile C, potassium permanganate oxidizable C and microbial biomass C fractions were the most sensitive to nutrient management. A threshold C input of 0.71 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) is required to maintain antecedent SOC, which is readily supplied to the soil using the region's current cotton-greengram intercropping system. Thus, this cropping system is quite capable to maintain antecedent SOC. We conclude that, in the context of changing climates, promoting cotton-legume intercropping using locally available farmyard manure/gliricidia as a substitute for 50%--Fertilizer N is a viable strategy for enhancing SOC storage while achieving sustainable productivity in semi-arid Vertisols of Central India.

Agronomic factors are the dominant influence on nitrogen fertilizer strategies in dryland cropping systems	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												Factors affecting fertilizer decisions made by grain growers are changing in the context of changing climatic conditions and growing volatility in global fertilizer and grain markets. To ensure sustainable development of grain industries in light of this uncertainty, research, development, extension, and adoption activities associated with growers' fertilizer decisions need to be focused on factors to which they are most sensitive. The aim of this paper is to understand the factors that have the greatest influence on grain producer's fertilizer strategies, how these factors have changed over recent years, and what is the relative importance of agronomic, socioeconomic, and logistical factors affecting these strategies. A telephone survey of 425 grain-growing businesses in Western Australia was conducted, and survey results were analyzed statistically. We show for the first time that grain growers' fertilizer decisions are most sensitive to agronomic factors (especially the amount and distribution of rainfall). Logistic factors (such as difficulties fertilizing increasing areas in short periods of time) are growing in influence as farm size, cropping areas, and the number of fertilizer applications within seasons increase. Fertilizer decisions have become less sensitive to socioeconomic factors over the last 10 to 15 years. To ensure sustainable development of grain production, research through to adoption activities should focus on agronomic issues (such as seasonal forecasting) and logistic issues (such as improving planning, organizational, and technical capacity for developing and implementing fertilizer strategies).

In order to study the effects of different nitrogen application rates under plastic film mulching on soil extracellular enzyme activities and stoichiometry, five nitrogen application levels (i.e., 0, 90, 150, 225 and 300 kg.hm(-2)) were set based on two treatments: plastic film mulching (PM) and no film mulching (LD). We measured the soil extracellular enzyme activities (EEAs) and stoichiometry (EES) of four enzymes (i.e., beta-1,4-glucosidase (beta G), leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), beta-1,4-N-acetylaminoglucosidase (NAG) and alkaline phosphatase (AP)) involved in the C, N and P cycles of soil microorganisms in surface soil at five maize growth stages (seedling stage, jointing stage, trumpet stage, grout stage and harvest stage). The results showed that there were significant differences in soil EEA at different maize growth stages. The soil nutrient content and soil EEA were significantly improved under PM, and the stoichiometric ratio of extracellular enzymes (E-C:(N:P)) was closer to 1:1:1, which indicated that PM was beneficial to the balance of soil nutrients and the activity of microorganisms. At each stage, with the increase in nitrogen application levels, the soil EEA showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing (or remained unchanged), and both LD and PM treatments reached their highest activity at the 225 kg.hm(-2) nitrogen application rate. When the nitrogen application level was less than 225 kg.hm(-2), the soil enzyme activity was mainly limited by the N nutrient, and when the nitrogen application level reached 300 kg.hm(-2), it was mainly limited by the P nutrient. RDA and correlation analysis showed that the soil C:P, C:N, N:P and pH had significant effects on soil beta G, NAG + LAP and AP activities as well as E-C(:N), E-C:(P) and E-N:P.					zhang, luyu/JJC-4227-2023	Hossain, Dr. Md Elias/0000-0002-3834-6838														2223-7747				JUL	2022	11	13							1748	10.3390/plants11131748	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants11131748								35807699					WOS:000825605900001

SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												The study of different types of tillage can be effective in promoting conservation agriculture for chickpea cultivation. The present experiment was conducted to study the effects of different soil management (reduced tillage (RT), no-tillage (NT), and conventional tillage (CT)) on morpho-physiological characteristics of chickpea in a complete randomized block design field experiment with three replications during the 2017-2019 cropping seasons. In this experiment effects of soil management on mycorrhizal colonization and sporulation, rhizobium nodules, relative leaf water content, leaf area index, chlorophyll and carotenoids, chlorophyll fluorescence, canopy temperature, enzymes, proline, hydrogen peroxide, malondialdehyde, leaf soluble proteins, carbohy-drates, and leaf P and N content were investigated in early grain filling were evaluated. The highest activity of antioxidant enzymes including catalase (0.066 U/mg- 1Protein min -1), peroxidase (1.22 U/mg- 1Protein min -1), and superoxide dismutase (0.69 U/mg- 1Protein min -1) were observed in the plants grown under CT practice, while the lowest were observed under NT system. In NT, the lowest amounts of malondialdehyde and carotenoids were retrieved compared to the conventional tillage. CT determined a reduction in chlorophyll in leaves compared to RT (13 %) and NT (36.2 %), respectively. The highest rate of canopy temperature depression occurred in no-tillage system. The highest remobilization from stems to seeds was respectively obtained from conventional tillage, reduced tillage and no-tillage treatments. In no-tillage, leaf area index, quantum efficiency of PSII (chlorophyll fluorescence), relative water content, leaf nitrogen, and leaf phosphorus increased compared to reduced tillage and conventional tillage, respectively. The rate of colonization and sporulation of mycorrhizal fungi and the number of rhizobium nodules significantly increased under NT compared to RT and CT systems. The results in this experiment showed that the NT system improved relative leaf water content, reduced anti-oxidant enzymes, and positive effects on measured morpho-physiological traits increased the yield and stability of chickpea compared to RT and CT systems under rainfed conditions.																			0167-1987	1879-3444				MAY	2023	229								105660	10.1016/j.still.2023.105660	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2023.105660		FEB 2023											WOS:000948506700001

The right trait in the right place at the right time: Matching traits to environment improves restoration outcomes	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The challenges of restoration in dryland ecosystems are growing due to a rise in anthropogenic disturbance and increasing aridity. Plant functional traits are often used to predict plant performance and can offer a window into potential outcomes of restoration efforts across environmental gradients. We analyzed a database including 15 yr of seeding outcomes across 150 sites on the Colorado Plateau, a cold desert ecoregion in the western United States, and analyzed the independent and interactive effects of functional traits (seed mass, height, and specific leaf area) and local biologically relevant climate variables on seeding success. We predicted that the best models would include an interaction between plant traits and climate, indicating a need to match the right trait value to the right climate conditions to maximize seeding success. Indeed, we found that both plant height and seed size significantly interacted with temperature seasonality, with larger seeds and taller plants performing better in more seasonal environments. We also determined that these trait-environment patterns are not influenced by whether a species is native or nonnative. Our results inform the selection of seed mixes for restoring areas with specific climatic conditions, while also demonstrating the strong influence of temperature seasonality on seeding success in the Colorado Plateau region.

Causes of leaf reddening in subterranean clover cultivars	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) is an important legume in dryland hill pastures in New Zealand. In this environment plants adapt to low temperatures (<10 degrees C) through a series of physiological mechanisms, such as the foliar biosynthesis of pigments, to protect vulnerable tissues. The biosynthesis of anthocyanins is one of the most important physiological responses for cold acclimation in plants. In this study we investigated anthocyanin concentration by accessing leaf reddening in 14 cultivars from three subspecies (yanninicum, brachycalycinum or subterraneum) during winter growth. The effect of anthocyanin production on spring herbage productivity was further quantified in the field and in the glasshouse. Leaf concentration of anthocyanins increased 10-fold as a consequence of cold exposure (mean daily air temperature was below similar to 7 degrees C) in red leaves compared with green leaves. There were large cultivar differences with yanninicum ssp. cultivars having the highest leaf reddening at >60%. Lowest values were observed in 'Antas' (brachycalycinum ssp.) and 'Denmark' (subterraneum spp.) at subterraneum ssp. cultivars had 13% higher leaf reddening values than Italian cultivars. Leaf reddening was a temporary, cold induced, anthocyanin response that did not affect subsequent subterranean clover plant growth.

In this study, the underlying water use efficiency (uWUE) method is compared with hydrometric and remote sensing-based ET partitioning methods. The uWUE method is considered to be a promising method for partitioning ET, and can also be used to obtain temporal continuous data with fine spatial representation. Thus, the uWUE method was used to partition ET in six typical ecosystems in the Heihe River basin (HRB), which is the second largest endorheic river basin in western China. During 2008-2016, the daily average contributions of T to ET (T/ET) were 0.53, 0.52, 0.59, 0.37, 0.56, and 0.59 in the alpine meadow, Qinghai spruce, maize, desert, Tamarix, and Populus euphratica-Tamarix ecosystems, respectively. The T/ET ratio exhibited obvious seasonal variations in alpine meadow, maize, Tamarix, and Populus euphratica-Tamarix ecosystems. The ET partitioning results were related to air temperature in all ecosystems, especially in areas with sufficient precipitation or irrigation water supply. The vapor pressure deficit was also a main controlling factor in the upper- and middle-reach ecosystems, especially in the Qinghai spruce ecosystem. Groundwater and/or soil moisture made high relative contributions (RCs, %) to the T/ET ratio of the riparian forest in the lower reaches. Additionally, the leaf area index also made a high RC to the T/ET ratio of deciduous vegetation. Determining the quantitative contribution of T to ET in the HRB is beneficial for water resource management to guide the rational allocation and efficient use of water resources.

Here we use in situ observations to assess the performance of monthly VPD calculated from state-of-the-art data sets including CRU, ERA5, and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA2). We investigate trends in VPD at global scale and for different climatic zones for 1981-2020 and future trends (2021-2100) from Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) outputs. The results show that monthly VPD estimated from CRU, ERA5, and MERRA2 correlated well against in situ estimates from 15,531 World Meteorological Organization stations, with R-2 ranging between 0.92 and 0.96. Moreover, robust correlations were also found across in situ stations and when analyzing different months separately. During 1981-2020, VPD increased in all climatic zones, with the strongest increase in the arid zone, followed by tropical, temperate, cold and polar zones. CMIP6 simulations show a continuously increasing trend in VPD (0.028 hPa year(-1)), with the largest increase in the arid zone (0.063 hPa year(-1)). The magnitudes of trends are found to increase following the magnitude of CO2 increases in the future emission scenarios. We highlight that atmospheric aridification will continue under global warming, which may pose an increasing threat to terrestrial ecosystems and particularly dryland agricultural systems.

Incorporating stakeholders' perceptions has been established as a critical factor to improve the success of restoration and conservation initiatives and decrease future social conflicts; however, it has barely been incorporated. Our objective was to analyze and compare the differences in the perceptions of Chilean dryland forest restoration of three groups: local community, experts, and government managers. We asked about: (1) what is the knowledge, importance, and uses that they have and give to the native forest and its restoration? (2) What is the willingness to restore the native forest? (3) What are the most valuable goods and services provided by the forest? (4) Where to begin to restore? (5) What criteria must be considered to prioritize areas to restore? To determine if the criteria selected were related to the stakeholder group, a semi-parametric multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 61 stakeholders. The community gave greater importance to restoring the ravines and creeks, the experts to restoring areas that increase landscape connectivity, and both experts and government managers to restoring areas of greater biodiversity and ecological value. The experts gave a lower value to both social and economic criteria compared to the local community and government managers. The differences among stakeholder perceptions must necessarily be considered in the restoration programs. Research on perceptions can contribute to decision-making and will favor the social approval and long-term success of restoration programs.

This study attempted to fill this gap by examining agricultural land changes and NPP responses in drylands. A data-driven assessment of effects on the NPP of individual agricultural land displacement was carried out using three methods: the mean difference method, a newly introduced ridge-regression method, and a proposed method based on actual change excluding climate impact. Increases in NPP were accompanied by agricultural land transitions from natural land cover and expected forests. The agricultural expansion mainly replaced sparse vegetation and grassland and increased the overall NPP of the dryland ecosystem. The mean difference method and ridge-regression method overestimated the NPP increase caused by agricultural land expansion. Land use change contributed more than 70% to NPP increase in the new agricultural area. However, land use change has less effect on total NPP in drylands than climate change. Monitoring agricultural land dynamics and distinguishing NPP changes caused by different agricultural land transitions is helpful for targeted management and sustainable development of agriculture in drylands.

JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Global drylands are threatened by grazing pressure intensification and climate change, which act as major drivers of land degradation. Detecting this process at an early stage is essential for predicting losses of ecological functions and for restoration management. Vegetation patch-size distribution is an indicator of dryland multifunctionality and has been proposed as a warning signal for the onset of degradation processes. However, we proposed and tested a general model that stresses that patchiness may fail to detect degradation of the forage provision, depending on plant community species composition. This is a key aspect since forage provision is strongly associated with human well-being in drylands. We hypothesized that grazing-induced changes in patchiness and forage provision converge in drylands dominated by forage species but are decoupled in those dominated or co-dominated by non-forage species. We tested the conceptual model in a unique regional-scale gradient with strong ecological differences but a common biogeographical and human impact history to reduce local contingencies effects. We compared datasets of grazing intensification impacts on (i) plant cover and patch-size distribution and (ii) plant density and plant-size distribution of dominant forage grasses (a proxy of forage provisioning). We showed that there is a decoupling between grazing-induced changes in vegetation patchiness and forage provisioning, particularly in drylands where non-forage species are dominant. In these drylands, plant cover and patch-size distribution were slightly affected by grazing intensification, whereas plant density of forage species was decimated and their plant-size distributions were strongly skewed towards small sizes. Synthesis. Our dryland conceptual model suggests that global change impacts on forage species populations can be detected even before changes in patch-size distribution and plant cover. Our findings support the model and indicate that the population status (plant density and plant-size distribution) of forage species allows for predicting forage dynamics and is useful to the early detection of losses of ecosystem services linked to human well-being in drylands.

Long-range seed dispersal enables almost stationary patterns in a model for dryland vegetation	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY												Spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation are a ubiquitous feature of semi-arid ecosystems. On sloped terrain, vegetation patterns occur as stripes perpendicular to the contours. Field studies report contrasting long-term dynamics between different observation sites; some observe slow uphill migration of vegetation bands while some report stationary patterns. In this paper, we show that long-range seed dispersal provides a mechanism that enables the occurrence of both migrating and stationary patterns. We utilise a nonlocal PDE model in which seed dispersal is accounted for by a convolution term. The model represents vegetation patterns as periodic travelling waves and numerical continuation shows that both migrating and almost stationary patterns are stable if seed dispersal distances are sufficiently large. We use a perturbation theory approach to obtain analytical confirmation of the existence of almost stationary patterned solutions and provide a biological interpretation of the phenomenon.

Soil Olsen P (0 - 20 cm, sampled at harvest of previous season wheat) and wheat-yearly rainfall from 781 wheat fields were also determined. Results: The wheat grain yield followed a piecewise linear model with the amount of wheat-yearly rainfall, with a threshold rainfall of 527 and 550 mm for the -P and +P treatments, respectively; the P uptake by wheat was also fitted to a piecewise model with wheat-yearly rainfall. When each site-year was classified into dry, intermediate, and wet rainfall years, a P uptake response to Olsen P was evident only in dry and intermediate years. Olsen P at harvest was 18.9% lower in dry/wet years than in intermediate years. Across all years, the critical Olsen P values were higher for -P (16.2 mg kg-1) than for +P (15.3 mg kg- 1) and were lower in dry and intermediate years than in wet years. In addition, an empirical model is proposed to manage P fertilization, where P application rates are calculated from the expected wheat P uptake and the Olsen P level in the soil based on wheat-yearly rainfall or summer-season rainfall.Conclusions: Wheat-yearly rainfall is the main factor affecting wheat yield, and the wheat-yearly rainfall and P input strongly affected the soil critical Olsen P values in the drylands of the Loess Plateau. A soil critical Olsen P value of 14 - 18 mg kg- 1 was determined for dryland wheat production. Implications: This research implied that the management of P fertilization for green wheat production should consider the rainfall and soil critical Olsen P value in dryland grain production systems.

Darrel			Rapid nitrate reduction produces pulsed NO and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions following wetting of dryland soils	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Soil drying and wetting cycles can produce pulses of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions with substantial effects on both regional air quality and Earth's climate. While pulsed production of N emissions is ubiquitous across ecosystems, the processes governing pulse magnitude and timing remain unclear. We studied the processes producing pulsed NO and N2O emissions at two contrasting drylands, desert and chaparral, where despite the hot and dry conditions known to limit biological processes, some of the highest NO and N2O flux rates have been measured. We measured N2O and NO emissions every 30 min for 24 h after wetting soils with isotopically-enriched nitrate and ammonium solutions to determine production pathways and their timing. Nitrate was reduced to N2O within 15 min of wetting, with emissions exceeding 1000 ng N-N2O m(-2) s(-1) and returning to background levels within four hours, but the pulse magnitude did not increase in proportion to the amount of ammonium or nitrate added. In contrast to N2O, NO was emitted over 24 h and increased in proportion to ammonium addition, exceeding 600 ng N-NO m(-2) s(-1) in desert and chaparral soils. Isotope tracers suggest that both ammonia oxidation and nitrate reduction produced NO. Taken together, our measurements demonstrate that nitrate can be reduced within minutes of wetting summer-dry desert soils to produce large N2O emission pulses and that multiple processes contribute to long-lasting NO emissions. These mechanisms represent substantial pathways of ecosystem N loss that also contribute to regional air quality and global climate dynamics.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of animal manure combined with straw on soil enzymes and microbial quantity. The two-year experiment involved four treatments: maize straw only, maize straw plus ox manure, maize straw plus chicken manure, and maize straw plus pig manure. In 2018 and 2019, treatments with animal manure combined with straw led to increased levels of soil microbial quantity, soil enzyme activity, and yields. Compared to other treatments, higher catalase activities were achieved in both years for the maize straw plus ox manure and maize straw plus pig manure treatments whereas the cellulase activities were higher for the maize straw plus ox manure and maize straw plus chicken manure treatments. The maize straw plus ox manure treatment had the highest number of soil bacteria, and the quantity of actinomycetes was higher after the applications of maize straw plus ox manure and maize straw plus chicken manure as compared to the other treatments. Moreover, compared to the application of maize straw only, treatment maize straw plus pig manure had the most significant effect on the soil urease activity, invertase activity, fungal quantity, and maize yield with 43.9, 35.9, 52.0, and 31.7% increases, respectively. In conclusion, our findings suggested that animal manure combined with straw, especially the application of maize straw plus pig manure was the most effective treatment for enhancing soil enzymes and microbial quantity and also promoting maize yield.																			0236-8722	2300-8725					2021	35	3					279	287		10.31545/intagr/142368	http://dx.doi.org/10.31545/intagr/142368													WOS:000730435600005

Holocene evolution of a floodplain wetland in the dryland piedmont of central-west Argentina	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												In arid central-west Argentina, South America, many wetlands have developed in association with rivers draining the Andean piedmont and are vital hotspots for resources. However, knowledge about their long-term evolution is generally scarce. The Baflados del Atuel wetland, a low gradient fluvio-aeolian plain linked to the Atuel-Diamante fluvial system, is analyzed to depict its geomorphological and sedimentological Holocene evolution. The study area comprises a fluvial fill terrace with fine-grained alluvial deposits (similar to 4186-4419 cal years BP), deposited by a palaeodistributary fluvial system, that is covered by SW-NE oriented aeolian dune complexes. The present-day wetland, which developed after formation of the fill terrace, is characterized by: (1) a NW-SE oriented floodplain with distributary channels and fine-grained, massive to laminated deposits of low organic matter content, dated to 2755-2864 and 729-895 cal years BP, and includes SW-NE oriented dune systems and salt flat depressions; and (2) a transfer area with active headcutting channels, entrenched in the fill terrace, that connects the NW-SE oriented floodplain with (3) a saline endorheic depression (salt lake) with active deflation. The fill terrace distribution suggests much more extensive floodplain environments prior to the late Holocene; the present-day wetland is not older than the last 2-3 millennia and records a late Holocene trend of floodplain size reduction. Fluvial processes of avulsion were likely driven by mid and late Holocene El Niflo Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Late Holocene arid conditions favoured aeolian dune formation and fluvio-aeolian interactions. Furthermore, anthropogenic river modifications, starting similar to 200 years ago, also have promoted severe changes in the AtuelDiamante fluvial system, deepening the aridity in the wetland.																			0923-4861	1572-9834				AUG	2022	30	4			SI		647	673		10.1007/s11273-022-09880-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-022-09880-6		MAY 2022											WOS:000791667100001

Using a combined image processing and field approach, we examined: (1) how variation in the land subsidence rate induces different soil compaction degrees; and (2) the response patterns of microbial communities to such variations. By using Sentinel Synthetic Aperture Radar image processing, we selected three locations that exhibited different land subsidence rates, including high (HSR), moderate (MSR), and low (LSR). Then, soil sampling was undertaken within these representative locations. Indicators of soil compaction, including total porosity, air-filled porosity, water-filled porosity, and bulk density, were measured. The soil microbial community was determined using qPCR and sequencing. The highest and lowest values for bulk density were observed in the HSR-MSR and LSR zones, respectively. The greatest values of total porosity and macropore volume were displayed in the LSR zone compared to other zones. Bacterial abundance in the LSR zone was significantly greater than that in the HSR and MSR zones. The relative abundances of bacterial taxa indirectly demonstrated that the anaerobic phyla were significantly increased (by 10-13%), and the aerobic phyla decreased (by 30-40%) in the HSR zone compared to the LSR zone. This result demonstrates that the aerobes declined as larger volumes of the soil became more anaerobic. Indeed, the increased abundance of anaerobes was not able to compensate for the larger decrease in the abundance of aerobes. Our work showed that at the increased rates of land subsidence, the abundance distribution of the microbial community critically declined. These findings highlight the critical impacts of increasing the land subsidence rate on the emergence of high soil compaction degrees, which can significantly affect the resilience thresholds of the microbial communities in dryland soils.

Seed dispersal by ants, i.e. myrmecochory, is important in drylands because ants may contribute to overcoming the typical resource limitation imposed on plants in these environments. Dispersal distance and directed dispersal of seeds to nutrient-enriched ant nests benefit plants by reducing parent or sibling competition and improving growth, survival, and reproduction. 2. This study investigated the role of ants as seed dispersers in the semi-arid Patagonian steppe. In particular, this study surveyed native and exotic plants potentially dispersed by ants (i.e. those with nutritive tissues attached to seeds that could attract ants), identified seed disperser ants, and compared their effectiveness as dispersers (i.e. number of removed seeds, transport distance, and seed fate). 3. It was found that 9% of plant species could be potentially dispersed by ants, and field experiments were carried out with five of them (three natives and two exotics). Six ant species dispersed seeds, with Dorymyrmex tener being the most effective seed disperser, interacting preferably with an exotic seed. Finally, the types of nutritive tissues of the seeds are important in determining the attractiveness towards different ant foraging groups. 4. This study's results highlight that ant foraging group and seed's nutritive tissues are relevant traits that could help in understanding ant-seed interactions. Furthermore, in the Patagonian steppe, there are effective seed disperser ants that could play an important role in the distribution of native plants, as well as the spread of invasive species, being especially relevant in nutrient-poor drylands due to the benefits provided by myrmecochory.

Livestock removal increases plant cover across a heterogeneous dryland landscape on the Colorado Plateau	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Livestock removal is increasingly used as a management option to mitigate the negative impacts of grazing-related disturbances on rangelands. Removal generally increases plant cover, but it is unclear when, where, and by how much plant and soil cover changes can be expected. On the Colorado Plateau, complex geology, topography, soils, and climate all interact to mediate the relationship between land cover, climate, and disturbance. In this study we used new developments in land cover mapping and analysis to assess landscape plant and bare soil cover up to 30 years after livestock removal from two grazing allotments in Capitol Reef National Park, Utah, USA. Results indicate that livestock removal increases plant cover 0.17%-0.32% per year and reduces bare soil cover 0.34%-0.41% per year, although these rates may be suppressed by warming temperatures. Soils, assessed through soil geomorphic units, played a strong but complex role in mediating land cover changes through time. These results suggest that livestock removal is an effective strategy for increasing plant cover and reducing bare soil on the Colorado Plateau, but including soil information in decision making will enhance efficiency by improving manager's ability to prioritize						Knight, Anna/0000-0002-9455-2855													1748-9326					MAR 1	2023	18	3								10.1088/1748-9326/acb728	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/acb728													WOS:000940127200001
