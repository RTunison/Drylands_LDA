Breeding in Kenya	SUSTAINABILITY												Participatory variety selection (PVS) is the selection of new varieties among fixed lines by farmers under different target environments. It is increasingly being used to select and promote new crop breeding materials in most African countries. A gender-responsive PVS tool was piloted in Embu and Nakuru in the first and second cropping seasons of 2019 to understand similarities and differences between men's and women's varietal and trait preferences for biofortified released varieties and local bean varieties (landraces). Pooled results indicate that varietal and trait preferences between men and women farmers were slightly different but followed gendered roles and division of labor. Women farmers have a higher preference for landraces compared to men due to their availability, affordability and accessibility. Preferences for bean varieties differed between men and women across the two counties. High yielding was the most prioritized trait by both men and women for Mwitemania, Nyota, and Angaza. The findings support the long-held assumption that men prefer market-oriented traits, but women have a greater range of concerns thus less market oriented than men. For Nyota, men's preferences were shaped by market traits, while women's preferences were based on the variety being early maturing, resistant to pests and diseases, marketable, and fast cooking. For other varieties, men preferred Mwitemania because it is high yielding, early maturing, resistant to pests and diseases, and marketable. In contrast, women preferred Mwitemania because of seed availability, fast cooking, and early maturing. However, men's and women's varietal preferences for Angaza were similar, with them reporting early maturing, resistance to pests and diseases, and marketability as attractive traits. Sociodemographic characteristics such as education, age, marital status, and land ownership underlined the differences in trait preferences. Despite having attractive traits for both men and women, Nyota increased drudgery, displaced women from their usual activities, and required additional inputs by women, signaling possible adoption tradeoffs. However, Nyota, Angaza, and Mwitemania can provide the opportunity to increase employment for women. This study calls for gender integration at the design stage of any breeding system to ensure men and women farmers have access to varieties they prefer for food and income generation.

Genotype Showing Seed-Coat Color Anomalies Due to Altered Anthocyanin Pathway	PLANTS-BASEL												This study reports the identification of a unique lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) genotype L4717-NM, a natural mutant (NM) derived from a variety L4717, producing brown, black, and spotted seed-coat colored seeds in a single plant, generation after generation, in different frequencies. The genetic similarity of L4717 with that of L4717-NM expressing anomalous seed-coat color was established using 54 SSR markers. In addition, various biochemical parameters such as TPC (total phenolic content), TFC (total flavonoid content), DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl), FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power), H2O2 (peroxide quantification), TCC (total carotenoids content), TAC (total anthocyanin content), and TAA (total ascorbic acid) were also studied in the seeds, sprouts, and seedlings of L4717, brown, black, and spotted seed-coat colored seeds. Stage-specific variations for the key biochemical parameters were recorded, and seedling stage was found the best for many parameters. Moreover, seeds with black seed coat showed better nutraceutical values for most of the studied traits. A highly significant (p <= 0.01) and positive correlation was observed between DPPH and TPC, TAA, TFC, etc., whereas, protein content showed a negative correlation with the other studied parameters. The seed coat is maternal tissue and we expect expression of seed-coat color as per the maternal genotype. However, such an anomalous seed-coat expression, which seems to probably be governed by some transposable element in the identified genotype, warrants more detailed studies involving exploitation of the anthocyanin pathway.

The treatments were control, tebuconazole, soil solarization and pesticidal weed extracts (Argemone mexicana, Parthenium hysterophorus, Tagetes minuta & Salvia aethiopis). Result showed that population density of beneficial soil microorganisms were recorded high in soils incorporated withP. hysterophoruswhen compared with soils incorporated with tebuconazole and solarization. Low percentages of disease incidence (3.3%) and severity (16%) were recorded in solarized plots as compared to control (11.7% and 65%, respectively). Application of tebuconazole,T. minutaand solarization increased yield of onion to 12, 11.95 and 10.6 tonnes ha(-1), respectively compared with untreated plot (8.03 tonnes ha(-1)). Thus, soil solarization and pesticidal weeds can be contributed to increase soil health and to the control of white rot diseases, and can be used as an alternative to the chemical pesticides.

Cultural practices and host plant resistance are effective measures for mitigating the losses caused by sorghum shoot fly. Therefore, we evaluated 32 sorghum genotypes consisting of a set of 10 restorer lines, 10 CMS (cytoplasmic male-sterile) lines and their respective maintainers exhibiting resistance/susceptibility to shoot fly along with resistant and susceptible checks under field conditions. The traits such as leaf glossiness, leaf sheath pigmentation, percentage plants with shoot fly deadhearts and number of shoot fly eggs per plant were used as morphological markers for selecting genotypes with resistance to shoot fly during the rainy and post rainy seasons of 2016 and 2017. The test material was also subjected to biochemical analysis (total soluble sugars, protein and tannin contents), while the leaf surface chemicals were analysed by GC-MS to identify the compounds associated with resistance/susceptibility to shoot fly. The genotypes differed significantly for all the traits, except percentage plants with shoot fly deadhearts during the 2016 rainy season. The genotypes ICSB 458, ICSA/B 467, ICSA/B 487, ICSA/B 14037, IS 18551 and ICSV 93046 exhibited moderate to high levels of resistance to shoot fly based on number of plants with shoot fly deadhearts, plants with shoot fly eggs and total number of shoot fly eggs. The shoot fly resistant genotypes ICSB 84, ICSA/B 467, ICSB 487, ICSB 14024, and IS 18551 had low shoot fly deadheart incidence, higher amounts of condensed tannins, soluble sugars, phenols and lower protein content as compared to the susceptible genotypes. Thirteen unique compounds were identified from leaf surface extracts by GC-MS which were associated with shoot fly resistance/susceptibility. While HPLC analysis revealed that Protocatechuic and coumaric acids were present in most of the sorghum genotypes, but their amounts were significantly greater in resistant as compared to the susceptible ones. The findings of the study highlight the importance of various morphological and biochemical traits conferring resistance to sorghum shoot fly, and these traits can be used as markers to identify shoot fly resistant genotypes for use in breeding programs.

The objective of this study was to examine whether plant residue amendments from stems and leaves (SL) of an agroforestry shrub (Piliostigma reticulatum) enriched with nitrogen (N) sources improve nutrient cycling in Soudano-Sahelian cropping systems. The experimental design was organized into four replicates with six treatments consisting of two treatments of SL residue amendments (amended and non-amended) in combination with three treatments including additional N sources (natural soils, urea, and cowpea as intercrop). The results showed that the activity of termites (Nasutitermes torquatus) and ants (Messor galla and Pachycondyla rufipes) was 12-13 and 2-3 times higher in the SL amended soils than in non-amended soils, respectively. The activity of earthworms (Millsonia inermis) was highest in the SL amended soils associated with the cowpea intercrop, and was significantly lower in the urea enriched soils. SL amendments and N enrichments had no effect on soil basal respiration. The substrate-induced respiration with N substrates (L-alanine and L-arginineL) was 25 and 52 % higher in the SL amended soils than in the natural soils without any N inputs, indicating N limitation of microbial activity. This corroborates the higher C/N ratio (14.3) observed in the SL amended soils compared to the natural soils without any inputs (10.3). The N enrichment decreased the C/N ratio of the SL amended soils but was not efficient to alleviate microbial catabolic limitations, likely by switching from N to C limitation. Overall, the SL amendments with or without N enrichments triggered temporarily the soil macrofaunal activity, increased the NH4-N availability compared to that of NO3-N, and improved crop performance.

However, information on mungbean CCA1L genes is limited. Results In this study, we identified 27 VrCCA1L genes from the mungbean genome. VrCCA1L genes were unevenly distributed on 10 of the 11 chromosomes and showed one tandem and two interchromosomal duplication events. Two distinct kinds of conserved MYB domains, MYB 1 and MYB 2, were found, and the conserved SHAQK(Y/F) F sequence was found at the C terminus of each MYB 2 domain. The VrCCA1Ls displayed a variety of exon-intron organizations, and 24 distinct motifs were found among these genes. Based on phylogenetic analysis, VrCCA1L proteins were classified into five groups; group I contained the most members, with 11 VrCCA1Ls. VrCCA1L promoters contained different types and numbers of cis-acting elements, and VrCCA1Ls showed different expression levels in different tissues. The VrCCA1Ls also displayed distinct expression patterns under different photoperiod conditions throughout the day in leaves. VrCCA1L26 shared greatest homology to Arabidopsis CCA1 and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY). It delayed the flowering time in Arabidopsis by affecting the expression levels of CONSTANS (CO), FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1). Conclusion We identified and characterized 27 VrCCA1L genes from mungbean genome, and investigated their spatio-temporal expression patterns. Further analysis revealed that VrCCA1L26 delayed flowering time in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Our results provide useful information for further functional characterization of the VrCCA1L genes.					wu, jialin/JPY-4408-2023; LI, SHA/JNR-9956-2023														1471-2164					MAY 17	2022	23	1							374	10.1186/s12864-022-08620-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-022-08620-7								35581536					WOS:000796961000002

Whole-genome resequencing-based QTL-seq identified candidate genes and molecular markers for fresh seed dormancy in groundnut	PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL												The subspecies fastigiata of cultivated groundnut lost fresh seed dormancy (FSD) during domestication and human-made selection. Groundnut varieties lacking FSD experience precocious seed germination during harvest imposing severe losses. Development of easy-to-use genetic markers enables early-generation selection in different molecular breeding approaches. In this context, one recombinant inbred lines (RIL) population (ICGV 00350 x ICGV 97045) segregating for FSD was used for deploying QTL-seq approach for identification of key genomic regions and candidate genes. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data (87.93 Gbp) were generated and analysed for the dormant parent (ICGV 97045) and two DNA pools (dormant and nondormant). After analysis of resequenced data from the pooled samples with dormant parent (reference genome), we calculated delta-SNP index and identified a total of 10,759 genomewide high-confidence SNPs. Two candidate genomic regions spanning 2.4 Mb and 0.74 Mb on the B05 and A09 pseudomolecules, respectively, were identified controlling FSD. Two candidate genes-RING-H2 finger protein and zeaxanthin epoxidase-were identified in these two regions, which significantly express during seed development and control abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation. QTL-seq study presented here laid out development of a marker, GMFSD1, which was validated on a diverse panel and could be used in molecular breeding to improve dormancy in groundnut.					yaduru, Shasidhar/HLW-8252-2023; Khan, Mohammad Aamir Waseem/AAP-1262-2021; Vishwakarma, Manish Kumar/ABE-8806-2021; GANGURDE, SUNIL S/S-4139-2016; Pandey, Manish/JPL-3773-2023; Varshney, Rajeev K/C-5295-2014	yaduru, Shasidhar/0000-0002-8520-578X; Khan, Mohammad Aamir Waseem/0000-0001-9734-8123; Vishwakarma, Manish Kumar/0000-0001-8068-2280; GANGURDE, SUNIL S/0000-0001-7119-8649; Varshney, Rajeev K/0000-0002-4562-9131; Kumar, Rakesh/0000-0001-5072-5673; Manohar, Surendra Singh/0000-0002-6540-6250; Pandey, Manish/0000-0002-4101-6530													1467-7644	1467-7652				APR	2020	18	4					992	1003		10.1111/pbi.13266	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.13266		OCT 2019						31553830					WOS:000491105700001

Soil arylsulfatase (ARS) activity indicates heavy metal pollution. However, the enzyme's substrate concentration can affect the toxicity evaluation of heavy metals using enzyme activity. Enzyme kinetic parameters directly reflect the potency of heavy metals, and the magnitude of these parameters does not change with the substrate concentration of soil enzyme. In this work, seventeen soils were exposed to Sb contamination to investigate the change of kinetic parameters of soil arylsulfatase under Sb stress. Results showed that Sb inhibited soil arylsulfatase activity. The maximum reaction rate (V-max) of soil arylsulfatase was reduced by 11.58-46.72% in 16 tested soils and unchanged in S15 when exposed to Sb. The Michaelis constant (K-m) presented three trends: unchanged, increased by 28.46-41.27%, and decreased by 19.71-29.91% under Sb stress. The catalytic efficiency (K-a as the ratio of V-max to K-m) decreased by 12.56-55.17% in all soils except for S12 and S16. Antimony acted as a non-competitive and linear mixed inhibitor by decreasing ARS activity in S1-S12, S14, and S17-S18 soils, as an uncompetitive inhibitor in S13 and S16 soils and as a competitive inhibitor in S15. The competitive and uncompetitive inhibition constants (K-ic and K-iu) were 0.058-0.142 mM and 0.075-0.503 mM. The ecological dose values of Sb to catalytic efficiency (K-a) of ARS (ED10-K-a) ranged from 50 to 1315 mg kg(-1). Soil pH and total phosphorus (TP) contents were the dominant factors responsible for Sb toxicity on K-a by affecting the interaction of inhibitor (Sb) with enzyme-substrate (ES) complex. The findings of this study advance the current knowledge on Sb toxicity to soil enzymes and have significant implications for the risk assessment of Sb in soils.

Br.]	PLOS ONE												Pearl millet is a key cereal for food security in arid and semi-arid regions but its yield is increasingly threatened by water stress. Physiological mechanisms relating to conservation of soil water or increased water use efficiency can alleviate that stress. Aquaporins (AQP) are water channels that mediate root water transport, thereby influencing plant hydraulics, transpiration and soil water conservation. However, AQP remain largely uncharacterized in pearl millet. Here, we studied AQP function in root water transport in two pearl millet lines contrasting for water use efficiency (WUE). We observed that these lines also contrasted for root hydraulic conductivity (Lpr) and AQP contribution to Lpr. The line with lower WUE showed significantly higher AQP contribution to Lpr. To investigate AQP isoforms contributing to Lpr, we developed genomic approaches to first identify the entire AQP family in pearl millet and secondly, characterize the plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIP) gene expression profile. We identified and annotated 33 AQP genes in pearl millet, among which ten encoded PIP isoforms. PgPIP1-3 and PgPIP1-4 were significantly more expressed in the line showing lower WUE, higher Lpr and higher AQP contribution to Lpr. Overall, our study suggests that the PIP1 AQP family are the main regulators of Lpr in pearl millet and may possibly be associated with mechanisms associated to whole plant water use. This study paves the way for further investigations on AQP functions in pearl millet hydraulics and adaptation to environmental stresses.

Increased rainfall may place saline/sodic soils on the tipping point of sustainability	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Increased rainfall is increasing the risk of the capillary movement of sodium (Na+) and other salts from buried marine sediments to the soil surface in the North American northern Great Plains. These salts reduce productivity and resilience while increasing their effect on the environment. Understanding the interactions among management, climate, cropping system, and soil is the first step toward implementing effective management plans. Unfortunately, while much work has been conducted, little is known about the effective management of semiarid dryland saline/sodic soils. This study determined the influence of soil depth on hydraulic conductivity and changes in soil Na+ (mg Na+ kg(-1) soil) to electrical conductivity (EC1:1) (dS m(-1)) ratio following high spring rainfall in 2019 in three soils.The soil parent materials were Glaciolacrustrine underlaid at a depth of approximately 15 m by marine sediments that contained Na+ and other salts. The landscape positions included in the study were a well-drained shoulder, moderately well-drained backslope, and a poorly drained toeslope soil. Based on the soil classification, shoulder and backslope subsoils were not predicted to be salt affected, while the toeslope soil was predicted to contain a natric soil horizon. Rainfall in 2018, 2019, and 2020 was 46, 76, and 37 cm, respectively, and soil cores were collected prior to and following the 2019 high rainfall. Soil cores were separated into the 0 to 7.5, 50 to 57.5, 82.5 to 90, 92.5 to 100, and 105 to 112.5 cm segments. Samples from 2018 were analyzed for soil EC1:1, pH, ammonium acetate extractable cations, soil particle size, available water at field capacity, drainable porosity, soil bulk density, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Samples from 2019 were analyzed for EC1:1 and ammonium acetate extractable Na+. Across the sampling sites, shoulder and backslope soils had higher saturated hydraulic conductivities than the toeslope soils. Saturated hydraulic conductivities were negatively correlated to pH (r = -0.55, p < 0.01), the Na+ to EC1:1 ratio (r = -0.66, p < 0.01), extractable Na+ (r = -0.56, p < 0.01), and sand content (r = -0.66, p < 0.01), and positively correlated to the silt content (r = 0.65, p < 0.01). A comparison between the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the Na+ to EC1:1 ratio suggests that saturated conductivities approached 0 cm h(-1) when the Na+ (mg Na+ kg(-1)) to EC1:1 (dS m(-1)) ratio exceeded 600. The 2019 high rainfall increased the risk of soil dispersion in the lower soil depths (>82.5 cm). For example, in the shoulder soil at the 105 to 112.5 cm depth, EC1:1 decreased 0.936 +/- 0.254 dS m(-1) from 2018 to 2019, whereas the exchangeable Na+ increased 688 +/- 283 mg kg(-1) soil. Our findings suggest that a climate change-induced shift in rainfall patterns can increase salinity and sodicity risks in northern Great Plains subsurface soils. Salinity and sodicity risks are expanding into zones not previously identified as at risk, and improving or maintaining the productivity of these soils requires careful planning.

The present paper tries to identify the effective botanical insecticides against these insect pests on citrus orange. An experiment was conducted in the established citrus orange farm in Kolla Temben at two farmer's fields, Adiha and Agibe during the off-season of 2018 under irrigation growing condition in a randomized complete block design with six treatments and replicated thrice. The findings in both experimental sites showed that the neem seed extract had a significantly (P=0.001) lower leafminer infestation levels compared to the untreated control which is on par to the insecticide treatment of dimethoate. On the other hand, in both areas, whitefly mortality of more than 81% on average was recorded from neem seed extract followed by Tree tobacco (70%) (P=0.001). For scale insects however, in both experimental sites, the highest mean percent mortality was recorded from the insecticide dimethoate 40% EC (86.9%, 87.2 & 86.0%on average) followed by neem seed and tree tobacco extracts,70.1 and 65.4% respectively. The botanicals particularly the neem seed extracts followed by tree tobacco are as effective as the chemical insecticide, dimethoate 40% EC, even superior in some cases, in controlling the target pests. Therefore, these botanicals could be used as an IPM component for against the target pests.

A cylinder of radius r, inserted vertically from the soil surface to a depth d, is used as a water supply tank, through which water infiltrates into the soil. The falling-head test is repeated without allowing the cylinder to be drained entirely to eliminate the effects of the initial soil moisture conditions. Either change in the water level (H) in the water supply cylinder or strong linearity between the infiltration flux (qs) and H can be used to determine Kfs directly or by multiplying the slope with an empirical ring-installation scaling length, Lg; thus, no soil-dependent variable is necessary. To obtain the Lg value for various conditions, we carried out numerical experiments using HYDRUS (2D/3D) with a recently implemented reservoir boundary condition for six different soil textures, ranging from coarse soil (e.g., sand) to fine soil (e.g., silty clay loam), and two different ranges of water levels, 15 <= H <= 25 cm and 2 <= H <= 6 cm. Numerical results showed that the Lg has a strong linear dependence on d and r, where Lg increases as d and r increase. We propose a new linear model to determine Lg with optimized coefficients for each H range. Numerical results showed no significant differences in the estimated Kfs after the second repetition, confirming that repeating the falling head test twice is sufficient. The newly obtained Lg values were then applied to the experimental data obtained at multiple fields having different soil textures. The Kfs values determined using the RFH method agreed well with those measured using the field two-ponding depths steady-state method and/or the FH method in the lab. These results demonstrate the reliability of the proposed RFH method.

We examined the effect of summer cover crops and N fertilization rates on soil water storage at wheat planting (SWP) and harvest (SWH), winter wheat yield, evapotranspiration (ET), and WUE from 2017-2018 to 2019-2020 at Changwu and Chang'an in the Loess Plateau of China. Cover crops were soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr., SB], sudangrass [Sorghum sudanense (Piper) Stapf, SG], soybean and sudangrass mixture (SS), and no cover crop (CK) and N fertilization rates were 0, 60, and 120 kg N ha(-1) applied to winter wheat. Soil water was measured to a depth of 2 m at wheat planting and harvest, and grain yield, ET, and WUE of wheat were evaluated. Cover crop biomass was greater for SS than SB at both sites. The SWP and ET were greater for CK than other cover crops at all N fertilization rates, but SWH varied for cover crops, N fertilization rates, years, and sites. Winter wheat grain yield and WUE were greater for SS than other cover crops and increased with increased N fertilization rates in all years and sites. Although SS and 120 kg N ha(-1) reduced SWP and ET, wheat yield and WUE were greater than other cover crops and N fertilization rates in the semiarid climatic condition of the Loess Plateau of China where annual precipitation is adequate to reduce the detrimental effect of water stress.

J	Fu, Y; Wang, DC; Sun, WP; Guo, MM				Fu, Yu; Wang, Dichen; Sun, Wenping; Guo, Mingming			Impacts of grass planting density and components on overland flow hydraulics and soil loss	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Although abundant studies have confirmed the positive effect of vegetation on runoff and soil erosion reduction, few studies have clarified the effects of planting density and its components (aboveground parts and roots) on slope runoff and soil erosion mechanisms. A series of field experimental plots were constructed on two slopes (3 degrees, 6 degrees), including a bare land plot as the control, three grassed plots with three grass (Agropyron cristatum) planting densities of 20 cm x 20 cm, 15 cm x 15 cm, and 10 cm x 10 cm, and a plot without aboveground parts, to examine runoff and soil erosion process under simulated overland flow of 4, 8, 12, and 16 L min(-1). The runoff regime was transformed from supercritical-turbulent flow to subcritical-laminar flow with increasing planting density. Grass significantly reduced the runoff rate (RR), velocity (V), shear stress (tau), stream power (omega), and soil loss rate (SLR), with average reductions of 38.6%, 56.6%, 76.5%, 87.6%, and 61.9%, respectively. The aboveground parts contributed 74.1% and 75.1% of the total reduction in RR and V, respectively, while the grass roots contributed to 84.9%, 89.7%, 84.9%, and 69.7% of the reductions in Reynolds number, tau, omega, and SLR, respectively. RR, V, tau, omega, and SLR were significantly affected by slope, inflow discharge, root density, and the ratio of grass stem area to plot area. The runoff-sediment relationship changed from positively exponential function to linear and power functions with the planting density increased. Grass significantly weakened the sensitivity of soil erosion by reducing soil erodibility and improving critical hydrodynamic triggering soil erosion. This study improved the understanding of grass controlling soil and water loss, and the plants with well-developed roots and planting space of 10-15 cm are preferred to provide a scientific reference for revegetation strategy.

Inorganic fertilizer use efficiency of millet crop increased with organic fertilizer application in rainfed agriculture on smallholdings in central Senegal	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Much effort has been spent on formulating guidelines for inorganic fertilizer use in millet crops in Sub-sahelian farms. However, these guidelines do not take into account the diversity of manuring practices. In this study we analyzed over two years (2016-2017) the use efficiency of an inorganic NPK fertilizer as affected by the two most contrasted categories of organic manure strategies (OMS) found in millet fields of central Senegal. 19 farmers' fields were selected in a village typical of that region, 11 and 8 of which respectively corresponding to categories OMS1 and OMS2 as follows: OMS1, locally referred to as Homefields, were fields continuously cropped with millet over the last 15 years, having received organic manure regularly in the past, and manured again at the onset of the 2016 rainy season. OMS2 fields locally referred to as Outfields, were not manured in 2016 and were rarely manured in the past. Four of them were continuously cropped with millet and the others had followed a triennial millet-peanut-fallow rotation. In 2017, no manure was applied in any of the OMS1 or OMS2 fields. A pairwise treatments with and without the same inorganic fertilizer dose was applied in each field in both 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons. In 2016, the higher the manure application, the higher the use efficiency of the inorganic fertilizer applied. The use efficiency of the inorganic N was most closely related to soil bulk density and P availability. In 2017, with no new manure amendment, millet yield in OMS1 was about three times higher than in 2016. It was close to the water-limited yield, suggesting that the residual effect of the manure applied in 2016 was high. The use efficiency of the inorganic N was generally low under these conditions. In OMS2, millet yield and use efficiency of inorganic fertilizer remained low in both years. The crop rotation with peanuts did not enrich the soil compared to the millet returning every year, but it reduced Striga hermontica infestation and increased the millet 1000-grain weight. The methodological approach developed here may help in formulating guidelines to deal with the diversity of farming practices in Sub-sahelian villages.

In this study, three maize flowering-related traits (DTT, days to tasselling; DTP, days to pollen shed; DTS, days to silking) were evaluated with an association panel consisting of 226 maize inbred lines and an F-2:3 population with 120 offspring from a cross between the T32 and Qi319 lines in different environments. A total of 82 significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 117 candidate genes were identified by genome-wide association analysis. Twenty-one quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and 65 candidate genes were found for maize flowering time by linkage analysis with the constructed high-density genetic map. Transcriptome analysis was performed for Qi319, which is an early-maturing inbred line, and T32, which is a late-maturing inbred line, in two different environments. Compared with T32, Qi319 showed upregulation of 3815 genes and downregulation of 3906 genes. By integrating a genome-wide association study (GWAS), linkage analysis and transcriptome analysis, 25 important candidate genes for maize flowering time were identified. Together, our results provide an important resource and a foundation for an enhanced understanding of flowering time in maize.																			1664-462X					MAR 22	2023	14								1145327	10.3389/fpls.2023.1145327	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2023.1145327								37035050					WOS:000963781800001

The emergence of tethered cut-to-length harvesting systems and small wood markets (e.g., biochar) could decrease costs and increase revenue generated from treatments. Over the course of 3 weeks, we observed both tethered (steeper slopes) and untethered cut-to-length fuel-reduction treatment on the Fremont-Winema National Forest in south-central Oregon and interviewed operators. We used those data to derive and contrast hourly costs and productivity for the harvester and forwarder. This was the first time a tethered harvester and forwarder were used in a fuel-reduction treatment on federal forests in this region. We developed and tested a variety of work time model forms for each machine. The mean utilization rate for the harvester was 64 percent on 17 tethered consolidated corridors but 87 percent on 28 untethered consolidated corridors. Similarly, the forwarder had a mean utilization rate of 76 percent on 30 tethered trips and 89 percent on 114 untethered trips. This reduced utilization rate could be because of the direct effects of tethering, the increased complexities of operations associated with steeper slopes, and the stand characteristics (e.g., lower stand density and tree sweep) associated with steeper slopes. Costs during tethered operations were higher than during nontethered operations, but lower than previous reports using cable logging.

Seeds and Foliar Treatment with γ-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA), Confers Protection to Reproductive Function and Yield Traits under High-Temperature Stress Environments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES												Gradually increasing temperatures at global and local scales are causing heat stress for cool and summer-season food legumes, such as lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.), which is highly susceptible to heat stress, especially during its reproductive stages of development. Hence, suitable strategies are needed to develop heat tolerance in this legume. In the present study, we tested the effectiveness of heat priming (HPr; 6 h at 35 degrees C) the lentil seeds and a foliar treatment of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA; 1 mM; applied twice at different times), singly or in combination (HPr+GABA), under heat stress (32/20 degrees C) in two heat-tolerant (HT; IG2507, IG3263) and two heat-sensitive (HS; IG2821, IG2849) genotypes to mitigate heat stress. The three treatments significantly reduced heat injury to leaves and flowers, particularly when applied in combination, including leaf damage assessed as membrane injury, cellular oxidizing ability, leaf water status, and stomatal conductance. The combined HPr+GABA treatment significantly improved the photosynthetic function, measured as photosynthetic efficiency, chlorophyll concentration, and sucrose synthesis; and significantly reduced the oxidative damage, which was associated with a marked up-regulation in the activities of enzymatic antioxidants. The combined treatment also facilitated the synthesis of osmolytes, such as proline and glycine betaine, by upregulating the expression of their biosynthesizing enzymes (pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase; betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase) under heat stress. The HPr+GABA treatment caused a considerable enhancement in endogenous levels of GABA in leaves, more so in the two heat-sensitive genotypes. The reproductive function, measured as germination and viability of pollen grains, receptivity of stigma, and viability of ovules, was significantly improved with combined treatment, resulting in enhanced pod number (21-23% in HT and 35-38% in HS genotypes, compared to heat stress alone) and seed yield per plant (22-24% in HT and 37-40% in HS genotypes, in comparison to heat stress alone). The combined treatment (HPr+GABA) was more effective and pronounced in heat-sensitive than heat-tolerant genotypes for all the traits tested. This study offers a potential solution for tackling and protecting heat stress injury in lentil plants.					Prasad, P.V.

Incorporating sediment connectivity index into MUSLE model to explore soil erosion and sediment yield relationships at event scale	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Sediment connectivity quantifies the intermediate processes between initial erosion and the corresponding sediment yield. However, fully capturing the variations in sediment connectivity at the event scale and revealing their impact on watershed sediment sources remains challenging. Herein, we established an event-based model to assess sediment connectivity by integrating runoff factors. The spatiotemporal variability of sediment con-nectivity was evaluated for 58 rainfall events in three heterogeneous watersheds. The degree of sediment con-nectivity served as an indicator to quantify the proportion of potential sediment transport from units to the watershed outlet, with 1 indicating that the eroded sediment can be fully connected and 0 indicating that it cannot be transported. Moreover, the controls of sediment connectivity on watershed sediment sources and yield were determined. Our results indicated that the watersheds with poor vegetation and dense gullies were char-acterized by high sediment connectivity during all the rainfall events. The connectivity degree was below 0.5 in approximately 80 % of the watershed area, suggesting that most of the eroded sediment was deposited. Rainfall amount and duration dominated the degree of connectivity of the distal hillslopes, while rainfall intensity exerted a primary control on the transport of sediments from riverbanks to the outlet. In addition, the increase of mismatched area between sediment connectivity and erosion resulted in the decrease of sediment yield. The interaction between sediment connectivity and erosion effectively explained the spatial patterns of sediment sources (p < 0.05). Our work confirmed that the coupled erosion model and sediment connectivity predicted the sediment yield accurately. The predictions for different watersheds portrayed that the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and Willmott's agreement index were greater than 0.70 and 0.89, respectively. These findings revealed the role of sediment connectivity and are the critical basis to identify watershed-specific sediment management practices.

Current treatments, including immunoglobulin G (IgG) immunoadsorption, plasma exchange, steroid pulse therapy, and the monoclonal antibody eculizumab, have limited effects against the severe neurologic sequelae. Multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring (Muse) cells are endogenous reparative non-tumorigenic stem cells that naturally reside in the body and are currently under clinical trials for regenerative medicine. When administered intravenously, Musecells accumulate to the damaged tissue, where they exert anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-fibrotic, and immunomodulatory effects, and replace damaged cells by differentiating into tissue-constituent cells. Here, severely immunocompromised non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD-SCID) mice orally inoculated with 9 x 10(9) colony-forming units of STEC O111 and treated 48 h later with intravenous injection of 5 x 10(4) Muse cells exhibited 100% survival and no severe after-effects of infection. Suppression of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) by RNAi abolished the beneficial effects of Muse cells, leading to a 40% death and significant body weight loss, suggesting the involvement of G-CSF in the beneficial effects of Muse cells in STEC-infected mice. Thus, intravenous administration of Muse cells could be a candidate therapeutic approach for preventing fatal encephalopathy after STEC infection.

Can intercropping be an adaptation to drought? A model-based analysis for pearl millet-cowpea	JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE												Cereal-legume intercropping is promoted within semi-arid regions as an adaptation strategy to water scarcity and drought for low-input systems. Our objectives were firstly to evaluate the crop model APSIM for pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.))-cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp) intercropping-and secondly to investigate the hypothesis that intercropping provides complimentary yield under drought conditions. The APSIM model was evaluated against data from a two year on station field experiment during the dry season of a semi-arid environment in Patancheru, India, with severe, partial and no water deficit stress (well-watered); densities of 17 and 33 plants per m(-2), and intercrop and sole crop production of pearl millet and cowpea. Overall, APSIM captured the dynamics of grain yields, indicated by the Willmott Index of Agreement (IA: 1 optimal, 0 the worst) 0.91 from 36 data points (n), total biomass (IA: 0.90, n = 144), leaf area index (LAI, IA = 0.77, n = 66), plant height (IA 0.96, n = 104 pearl millet) and cowpea (IA 0.81, n = 102), as well as soil water (IA 0.73, n = 126). Model accuracy was reasonable in absolute terms (RMSE pearl millet 469 kg/ha and cowpea 322 kg/ha). However, due to low observed values (observed mean yield pearl millet 1,280 kg/ha and cowpea 555 kg/ha), the relative error was high, a known aspect for simulation accuracy in low-yielding environments. The simulation experiment compared the effect of intercropping pearl millet and cowpea versus sole cropping under different plant densities and water supplies. A key finding was that intercropping pearl millet and cowpea resulted in similar total yields to the sole pearl millet. Both sole and intercrop systems responded strongly to increasing water supply, except sole cropped cowpea, which performed relatively better under low water supply. High plant density had a consistent effect, leading to lower yields under low water supply. Higher yields were achieved under high density, but only when water supply was high: absolute highest total intercrop yields were 4,000 (high density) and 3,500 kg/ha (low density). This confirms the suitability of the common practice among farmers who use the low planting density under water scarce conditions. Overall, this study confirms that intercropping is no silver bullet, i.e. not per se a way to achieve high yield production or reduce risk under drought. It does, however, provide an opportunity to diversify food production by additionally integrating protein rich crops, such as cowpea.

To increase the grain yield of winter wheat in this region, the effects of different agronomic practices, including adjusting planting pattern (NR, narrow row spacing), increasing seeding rate (high seeding rate, HS), decreasing basal nitrogen rate and increasing top-dressed nitrogen rate (DBN), and replacing an old cultivar with a new cultivar (NC) on wheat yield were investigated for two consecutive years. The results showed that the current grain yield of rainfed winter wheat in the Loess Plateau could be increased to 5879-7093 kg ha(-1) by HS, DBN and NC practices relative to the practice of high-yielding farmers (PF). The increased yield due to HS, DBN and NC was attributed to the higher number of spikes ha(-1), 1000-grain weight, and kernels spike(-1). Before the flowering stage, HS increased soil water consumption (SWC) in 1-3 m subsoil due to the higher plant population compared with that of PF, whereas DBN decreased SWC in the 0-2 m soil layer compared with that of PF. After the flowering stage, HS, DBN, and NC increased SWC by 8-16 mm in 2-3 m subsoil compared to PF. The water use efficiency (WUE) was increased under DBN and NC in comparison with PF. However, the WUE did not increase under HS as it had the highest evapotranspiration among the five treatments. Increasing the use of subsoil water during the late growth stage by optimizing agronomic practices or applying new cultivars with expansive roots should be the primary approach to increase rainfed winter wheat yield in this region.

In part 2, more detailed meteorological analyses support the interpretation of the airborne measurements for aerosol transport and its interaction with low clouds over the southeastern (SE) Atlantic Ocean during the September 2016, August 2017, and October 2018 deployments at a daily and synoptic scale. The key meteorological characteristics during the September 2016 deployment are (1) the southern African easterly jet (AEJ-S), centered at around 600 hPa (similar to 4 km), which strengthens throughout the month in concert with a warming continental heat low, with the strongest winds occurring around 23 September. These advect both aerosol and moisture in the free troposphere. (2) Mid-tropospheric black carbon (BC) is entrained at times into the boundary layer, and (3) convection over land is dry south of about 10 degrees S and moist north of 10 degrees S. The daily mean low-cloud fraction (low CF) is well correlated with the daily mean high low tropospheric stability (LTS, r=0.44-0.73 over the flight domain; 0-10 degrees E, 5-25 degrees S) and moderately correlated with the daily mean boundary layer height (BLH, r=0.37-0.52), defined as the altitude of the maximum vertical gradient of moisture. For the August 2017 deployment, the primary meteorological characteristics are that (1) the AEJ-S is at a lower altitude (similar to 3 km; similar to 700 hPa) and further north (5-7 degrees S) than in September 2016 and only becomes established by 20 August, with a separate easterly jet present aloft above 500 hPa (similar to 5.5 km) before that, (2) the mid-tropospheric BC-RH coupling strengthens after the AEJ-S develops, at around 3 km, (3) the daily mean low CF is less closely correlated with the daily mean LTS (r=0.16-0.57) and BLH (r=0.11-0.25) than in September 2016, and (4) dry convection reaches 700 hPa over the Namibian-Kalahari dryland (similar to 15-25 degrees S, similar to 18-24 degrees E), generating the moist plume subsequently advected over the southeastern Atlantic by the AEJ-S. For the October 2018 deployment, the key meteorological characteristics are that (1) the AEJ-S develops around 600 hPa, driven by the Kalahari heat low (similar to 10-25 degrees S, similar to 12-24 degrees E), but it diminishes over time as moist continental convection moves southward, (2) the offshore advection of mid-tropospheric BC (similar to 4 km, 600 hPa) and water vapor are strongly modulated by the AEJ-S around 8-10 degrees S in early October, but this decreases as mid-latitude frontal systems develop and the AEJ-S weakens around mid-to-late October, (3) the AEJ-S-low-level jet (LLJ) over the coastal Namibian region relationship is the strongest among all deployment months, and the daily mean low CF is largely reduced by the strong daily mean LLJ, especially to the cloud deck's south, and (4) the relationship of the daily mean low CF with the daily mean BLH and LTS are insignificant compared to the other 2 deployment months, partially due to the variability introduced by the passage of the mid-latitude disturbance.

Using spring wheat cv. Longchun 27 as test material, a field experiment involved two treatments: (i) whole-field soil plastic mulching and bunch seeding (PM); (ii) uncovered and bunch seeding (CK). The results showed that soil water storage in the 0-300 cm profile for PM was higher than that of CK. Before the jointing stage, the periodic water consumption, water consumption modulus coefficient and water consumption intensity of PM were lower than CK by 10.7-36.2 mm, 19.8-52.4% and 9.1-52.7%; However, from jointing to heading, they were correspondingly higher by 15.8-21.8 mm, 19.5-34.1% and 18.2-32.9% (P < 0.05). The above-ground biomass, crop growth rate and water consumption efficiency of PM were significantly higher than that of CK. Based on the significantly increased spike length, grain number per spike and 1000-grain weight, PM increased grain yield by 8.9-22.8%, and WP by 9.9-25.2% without significant change of evapotranspiration, as compared with CK. Consequently, PM regulated the water consumption characteristics of spring wheat, resulting in significantly increased water productivity and grain yield.																			1531-0353	1531-0361				OCT	2020	69	4					914	927		10.1002/ird.2458	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ird.2458		MAY 2020											WOS:000530875900001

Effect of adult feeding substrates on survival and reproduction of <i>Therophilus javanus</i> and <i>Phanerotoma syleptae,</i> two parasitoids of <i>Maruca vitrata</i>	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE												The current study was designed to assess the effect of different feeding substrates on survival and reproduction of Therophilus javanus (Bhat & Gupta) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and Phanerotoma syleptae Zettel (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) in order to optimize their potential as biological control agents against Maruca vitrata Fabricius (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). Experiments were carried out in laboratory with batches of ten adult females exposed to flowers of either Vigna unguiculata (L) Walp., Tephrosia candida (Roxb.) DC, and Sesbania rostrata Bremek & Oberm, pure honey, honey solution, or saccharide solution to assess parasitoid survival. Parasitoid fecundity was evaluated with separate couples of each species using the same substrates. The highest longevity and mean fecundity were obtained for the parasitoids exposed to Tephrosia candida flowers, while there was no difference between control (starved adults) and adults fed using S. rostrata flowers. The putative nutritional compounds of different flowers used in our study affected the biological parameters and performance of these parasitoids differently. Flowers of Tephrosia candida can serve as feeding substrates to both P. syleptae and T. javanus. This study suggests the possibility of using host plants at the flowering stage as a release point for the deployment of the two parasitoids in a classical biological control programme against M. vitrata.																			1742-7584	1742-7592				AUG	2022	42	4					3073	3082		10.1007/s42690-022-00844-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42690-022-00844-0		JUL 2022											WOS:000827369700001

Adoption of improved or diverse seed varieties is a promising strategy to achieve increased yields, support food security and reduce poverty under climate change in East Africa. However, rigorous impact evaluations linking the contributions of improved seeds to the welfare of households have been limited. This paper evaluates the impact of diversified seed systems on farm household production, sales, income, consumption and seed storage in Kenya and Uganda. It applies four-cell analysis to explore the intra-specific diversity of crops within farming systems, using primary data obtained from a random sampling of 207 treatment households and 87 control households. Propensity score matching was used to investigate the relationship between adoption of improved seeds and changes in production, sales, income, consumption, seed storage and food security. Econometric results indicate that treatment households using improved seeds saw a significant positive impact on income from bean seed sales, sorghum and millet consumption, bean livestock feed and maize and millet seed stored. We conclude that increasing seed diversity helps farmers cope with climate change and increases productivity, food availability, incomes and food security. Partnerships among seed improvement stakeholders need to be enhanced to ensure a continued supply of appropriate seeds to farmers.

However, the key mechanism by which RFMS drives spatiotemporal hydrothermal variation of soil to positively affect crop production is not well-defined, and a better understanding of this mechanism could guide RFMS optimization. A two-year field experiment was conducted with three planting treatments: 1) the RFMS with high coverage ratio, 50 cm mulched ridge:10 cm bare furrow, RFH; 2) the RFMS with low coverage ratio, 60 cm mulched ridge:60 cm bare furrow, RFL; and 3) flat planting without mulching as the control treatment, CK. The results showed that RFMS increased topsoil temperature by 1.0-2.5 degrees C during the day (08:00-20:00) and 1.6-3.4 degrees C at night (20:00-08:00), respectively, compared with CK, which led to a decrease of 0.4-1.3 degrees C in diurnal temperature amplitude, but indicated a strong positive impact on maize growth in the thermally deficient study area. In addition, RFMS drove the spatio-temporal alternation of soil wetting and drying (alternation of high and low SWC) relative to CK, indicating an efficient water use strategy that significantly reduces soil evaporation but promotes the plant transpiration during water sensitive period. These effects in RFH were significantly greater than those in RFL due to its significantly enhanced water infiltration, suppressed evaporation and reduced heat loss, which stimulated vigorous crop growth. This study suggested that, compared to CK, RFH was more efficient than RFL to improve maize production, which increased these amplitudes from 43.1% to 59.2% in grain yield increase, from 38.5% to 57.4% in water use efficiency (WUE) increase and from 71.7% to 95.0% in economic benefit increase, respectively. Therefore RFH can be considered as a superior technique for overcoming simultaneous drought and cold stresses in northwestern China.

However, how elevation changes control soil ecological processes through temperature and the mechanism that affects the carbon cycle remain unclear. Therefore, we have studied the distribution of temperature, bulk density (BD), soil pH, mean weight diameter (MWD), clay, and diversity of soil fungal community diversity, and discussed the critical factors affecting soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N) in a typical karst mountainous area. The results showed that the dominant phyla were Ascomycota (42.28%), Mortierellomycota (20.6%), Basidiomycota (17.83%), and Rozellomycota (11.82%). The elevation distributions of MWD, fungal diversity, the rate of SOC and N stocks change per temperature index, and SOC and N stocks all exhibited unimodal patterns. Additionally, temperature, fungal diversity, MWD, BD, and clay were the dominant factors explaining the variability of SOC and N, and SOC and N had a positive relationship with pH, BD, MWD, clay-silt content, warmth index, and Sobs and Shannon diversity. Analyses showed that the warmth index regulated soil aggregates through fungal diversity and combined with BD to affect carbon sequestration, which was controlled by clay, the C:N ratio, and pH during the process. These conclusions have important implications for improving the SOC sequestration capacity in karst mountainous areas.

An "Axiom Cajanus SNP Array" based high density genetic map and QTL mapping for high-selfing flower and seed quality traits in pigeonpea	BMC GENOMICS												BackgroundPigeonpea has considerable extent of insect-aided natural out-crossing that impedes genetic purity of seeds. Pre-anthesis cleistogamy in pigeonpea promotes self-pollination which helps in maintaining genetic purity. The cleistogamous flowers are linked with shriveled seeds, an undesirable trait from variety adoption point of view, and breeding using genomics tools can help in overcoming this constraint. Therefore, in order to identify genomic regions governing these target traits, one recombinant inbred line (RIL) population was developed using contrasting parents (ICPL 99010 and ICP 5529) for flower shape and shriveled seeds. The RILs were phenotyped for two years and genotyped using the Axiom Cajanus SNP Array.ResultsOut of the 56,512 unique sequence variations on the array, the mapping population showed 8634 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) segregating across the genome. These data facilitated generation of a high density genetic map covering 6818 SNPs in 974cM with an average inter-marker distance of 0.1cM, which is the lowest amongst all pigeonpea genetic maps reported. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis using this genetic map and phenotyping data identified 5 QTLs associated with cleistogamous flower, 3 QTLs for shriveled seed and 1 QTL for seed size. The phenotypic variance explained by these QTLs ranged from 9.1 to 50.6%. A consistent QTL qCl3.2 was identified for cleistogamous flower on CcLG03 covering a span of 42kb in the pigeonpea genome. Epistatic QTLs were also identified for cleistogamous flower and shriveled seed traits.ConclusionIdentified QTLs and genomic interactions for cleistogamous flower, shriveled seed and seed size will help in incorporating the required floral architecture in pigeonpea varieties/lines. Besides, it will also be useful in understanding the molecular mechanisms, and map-based gene cloning for the target traits.

However, there is no consensus among researchers on the most appropriate field management practices regarding WUE, which requires further integrated quantitative analysis. We conducted a meta-analysis by computing 1338 effect sizes from 171 publications to quantify the effect of agricultural practices (nitrogen (N) fertilizer management, mulching management, water-saving irrigation, straw return and conservation tillage) on crop WUE. Our results showed that N fertilizer management (51.83% increase, P < 0.05) is the most effective practice for improving the crop WUE, followed by mulching management (17.44% increase, P < 0.05), water-saving irrigation (15.97% increase, P < 0.05), straw return (10.00% increase, P < 0.05), and conservation tillage (5.09% increase, P < 0.05). This study also identified the key drivers (including climatic factors, soil factors, and human intervention factors) that affect the crop WUE under various field management practices. For example, the mean annual precipitation, annual evaporation, soil type, pH, soil total nitrogen content, N application frequency, N fertilizer type, and N application rate were identified as the key factors that affect the crop WUE under N fertilizer management practices. In addition, we quantified the effects of the different drivers on the crop WUE under various field management practices by subgroup analysis, and then the drivers level with the best improvement effect of WUE was determined. Specifically, when the N application rate is 150-225 kg ha-1, the N fertilizer type is controlled release urea, the soil covering ratio is more than 0.5, the irrigation method is drip irrigation, the amount and length of straw returning is 10,001-15,000 kg ha-1 and less than 0.5 cm, etc., the improvement effect of crop WUE was the best.

As a consequence of the diversification of EVP, there emerged distinctive soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (SPAC) systems in different plant groups, including among others the zosterophyllopsids, drepanophycaleans, pseudosporochnaleans, and archaeopteridaleans. Each of these groups has been extensively studied and can be described by different SPAC models. Key innovations that are closely associated with water transport processes, and that involve roots, vascular tissues, stomata, leaves, and body size and architecture, evolved in different groups, leading to more complex and presumably more efficient water cycling in the SPACs. The earliest vascular plants of the Silurian and Early Devonian periods typically show small aboveground stature with shallow roots, although some groups such as zosterophyllopsids and drepanophycaleans are characterized by extensive rhizomatous clonal growth, producing complex and shallow underground rhizome systems. Nevertheless, deeper underground water did not become available to plants until deep roots evolved during the Middle to Late Devonian. Within the evolving SPAC systems, soils from the Early Devonian onward showed increasing thickness and complexity of horizonation, increased maturity in composition, and diversification of soil classes. Forest canopies that first appeared in the Middle Devonian would have had a profound impact on water runoff, evaporation and transpiration. Therefore, the evolution of plants in both their underground and aboveground tissues, as well as their enhanced effects on water cycles and weathering domains, led to a dramatic expansion of the Earth's Critical Zone. The radiation of EVP enhanced feedbacks among vegetation, geomorphology and water cycles. From the late Silurian onward, the tracheophyte-type land-ocean hydrologic continuum (LOHC) was established as an essential landscape on the Earth's surface, as exemplified by the Old Red Sandstone facies of the Laurussian paleocontinent and the non-marine siliciclastic sequence of Qujing, Yunnan of the South China Block. Such LOHCs are characterized by geomorphological stability of inland drainage basins and coastal areas, leading to establishment of vegetated, stable lowlands that provided accommodation space for increasing volumes of fine-grained particles derived from plant-induced intensified weathering. Such lowlands provided abundant opportunities for preservation of plant fossils and organic matter, contributing to an apparent increase in plant diversity from the late Silurian through Late Devonian; that is, the diversification of EVP enhanced landscape stability, thus providing more opportunities for plants themselves to be preserved in the fossil record. The evolution of EVP was closely coupled with changes to carbon and water cycles by SPAC and LOHC systems and the underlying processes. Development of geomorphologically stable wetlands favored an increase in burial of terrestrial organic carbon as coals and other organic-rich sediments, as well as long-term pedogenesis on dryland floodplains, processes leading to an increase in organic and inorganic carbon sequestration, respectively. As current understanding of EVP-based SPAC models is qualitative and highly speculative, directions for future studies include investigation of character evolution in different plant groups that will contribute to a better understanding of water transport process in early plants. Studies of long-term evolution of tracheophyte-type LOHC at multiple spatial scales and across geological time, from microscopic- to habitat-, regional-, and global scales, will contribute to a better understanding of the interrelationships among EVP, water-carbon cycles, and Earth's surface environments.

Despite the crucial role of desert clouds in the distribution of water and energy budgets, their climatology is still largely incomplete. With arid regions projected to become dryer under global warming conditions, understanding the characteristics of their cloud cover can provide critical insights. In this work, cloud coverage was investigated over one of the Earth's most arid regions - the Arabian Peninsula. Four total cloud cover (FCC) products, namely the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project H (ISCCP), the CM SAF Cloud, Albedo and Surface Radiation AVHRR 2 (CLARA) satellite datasets, the National Centers for Environmental Prediction - National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) Reanalysis (R-2) (NCEP) and the ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA) reanalyses, were used to construct a climatology of desert clouds over the peninsula between 1984 and 2009, accounting for the different products' uncertainties and limitations. Satellite retrievals and reanalysis fields were first validated against ground observations from the United Arab Emirates, for which homogeneity assessments were conducted. The validation was done using statistical indicators, including Normalized Root Mean Square Errors (nRMSE), relative biases (rBIAS), and correlation coefficients, on monthly and seasonal scales. The ISCCP dataset resulted in the highest correlations with the ground observations (overall 0.38) and the lowest nRMSE (overall 0.54), while CLARA had the lowest rBIAS (overall 0.02). All products showed discrepancies when compared to the ground observations, both annually and on a seasonal basis. When extended to the entire Arabian Peninsula, the satellite and reanalysis products showed decreasing spring and increasing summer (except for ISCCP) TCC evolution across the region. At inter-annual scales, the TCC over the peninsula showed a significant discontinuity in 1998. This shift could be linked to the forcing of the El Nino Southern Oscillation on water vapor transport over the region, as well as to documented artifacts in satellite retrievals and model outputs. These discrepancies are indicative of a need for detailed assessments to be made of the uncertainties existing in TCC data for the Arabian Peninsula. Plain Language Summary: Clouds represent a primary source of uncertainty in future climate predictions. This is particularly pronounced in dryland clouds, given their sporadic and intermittent nature. With global warming predicted to enhance aridification trends in terrestrial arid zones, historical cloudiness trends over arid and hyper arid regions are very important - yet their climatology to date is still largely incomplete. The quality of observations and/or model outputs are an important consideration, making validation and intercomparison assessments imperative. This work investigated cloud cover over the Arabian Peninsula, one of the most arid regions on the Earth. Four cloud cover datasets were used, derived from satellite measurements and atmospheric reanalysis model outputs. The selected study period was between 1984 and 2009. The four datasets were initially compared with observations taken at ground stations in the United Arab Emirates. The four products were then studied over the entire Arabian Peninsula. Results showed that cloud cover displayed marked seasonal characteristics and large inter-annual temporal evolution. An abrupt change in regional cloud cover time series was found to occur in 1998. This could be attributed to the forcing of the El Nino Southern Oscillation, although significant documented uncertainties in satellite products over this time span call for deeper investigations of this causal relation.

Ethiopian mustard (Gomenzer) Brassica carinata (A) Braun var. Yellow Dodolla was grown under three different water treatments; drought-stressed, well-watered and water-logged conditions to evaluate glucosinolate content and performance of two aphid species, the generalist Myzus persicae (Sulzer) and specialist Brevicoryne brassicae (L.). The analysis of High Performance Liquid Chromatography showed that water stress altered the levels of glucosinolates in (B) carinata plants. Plants cultivated under water-logged showed significantly higher glucosinolate content (2.236 mu mol/g) when compared to well-watered (1.307 mu mol/g) plants, whereas plants grown under drought-stressed (0.773 mu mol/g) showed significantly reduced glucosinolate content after two week stress. B. carinata plants grown under water-logged condition had significantly higher sugar level (785.8 mu g/g) followed by well-watered (667.6 mu g/g) and drought-stressed (637.9 mu g/g) plants after two week stress. Both aphid species reacted differently to water stress-induced change in the host plants. Significantly higher number of B. brassicae was recorded on plants grown under drought-stressed (395 aphids) plants than well-watered (278 aphids) and water-logged plants (179 aphids). Populations of M. persicae were significantly larger on plants grown under water-logged (558 aphids) and followed by well-watered (329 aphids) and drought-stressed plants (193 aphids). Feeding by both aphid B. brassicae and M. persicae increased significantly the level of glucosinolates in B. carinata plants. B. brassicae induced higher amount of glucosinolate content (3.85 mu mol/g) when feeding on drought-stressed plants whereas M. persicae induced higher glucosinolate content (3.55 mu mol/g) on water-logged plants. Water stressed B. carinata plants resulted to lower glucosinolate content and higher aphid population.																			1742-7584	1742-7592				JUN	2021	41	2					953	960		10.1007/s42690-020-00340-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42690-020-00340-3		NOV 2020											WOS:000592977800001

However, the formation of thick eolian dust deposits requires not only climatic prerequisites for dust emission and transport but also climatic and topographic conditions favourable for deposition and accumulation. The scarcity of widespread eolian deposition around the CLP before 7-8 Ma hinders a full understanding of the processes and mechanisms of Central Asian aridification. The deposition of eolian dust also impacts the hydrogeochemistry of fluvial systems and the precipitation of authigenic phases in continental sedimentary systems could be an archive for studying eolian dust dynamics when pure eolian deposits are scarce. Here, we present the Ca-Mg-Sr concentrations and Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope compositions of bulk carbonates in a new fluvial sequence (12.7-4.8 Ma) of the Xining Basin. The Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios of the carbonate describe a power law relationship with a power coefficient of 0.8, lower than the coefficient characteristic of prior calcite precipitation (PCP). An input of eolian dust with the dissolution of Mg-rich carbonate is likely responsible for the deviation from a pure PCP process. The bulk carbonates also show a general decrease of Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios from 12.7 to 4.8 Ma, with a transition around 8.6 Ma revealed by lower Sr/Mg ratios. The comparison of these proxies to a previously reported fluvial section (12.2-5.1 Ma) in the Linxia Basin, similar to 200 km to the southeast, shows that the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of the bulk carbonates and water-soluble salts in the Linxia Basin are around 0.7098, which is 0.0018 lower than those in the Xining Basin before 8.6 Ma, but shows a significant rise between 8.6 and 7.0 Ma. The two basins share the same range of carbonate Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios when sediments are younger than 7 Ma. For the last 7 Myrs, the evolution of the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios in bulk carbonates of fluvial sediments and Pliocene-Quaternary eolian deposits found in the Xining Basin are similar to those in typical eolian red clays/loess-palaeosol sequences on the CLP. These results suggest a transition of the hydrochemical regime at 8.6 Ma in the Linxia Basin from a catchment only influenced by the weathering of its bedrock to one significantly impacted by eolian dust input. In the Xining Basin, the carbonate elemental and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios are consistent with a hydrochemistry more impacted by the presence of the eolian dust. There, the dust input occurred earlier, at >= 12.7 Ma, though it has strengthened since 8.6 Ma. The eolian dust impact on fluvial systems in the Xining Basin was much earlier than in the Linxia Basin and also preceded the initial accumulation of widespread eolian red clays on the CLP (7-8 Ma), suggesting a temporally propagating and spatially stepwise expansion of eolian dust delivery across the Asian inland during the late Cenozoic.

Natural recovery rates of moss biocrusts after severe disturbance in a semiarid climate of the Chinese Loess Plateau	GEODERMA												Biocrusts are vulnerable to large scale disturbances including trampling activities, and their recovery rates are highly variable with estimates fluctuating by more than one order of magnitude, from < 5 years (very fast) to > 250 years (very slow). Also, the development of microbial abundance and community diversity of biocrusts after disturbances is poorly understood. In a semiarid climate of the Chinese Loess Plateau, we conducted a recovery experiment on well-developed moss biocrusts after a severe disturbance, during which the entire upper 3 cm of the surface was removed. In the following nine years, the general characteristics and microbial community of the recovering and undisturbed biocrusts as well as a substrate with no crust (bare sand) were periodically determined. Through linear or logistic extrapolation of the observed recovery rates, the recovery time of the biocrusts after disturbance was estimated by both biocrust characteristics and microbial community. Recovery time yielded the following estimates: a) coverage within 3 years, b) thickness within 8 years, c) biomass within 9-13 years, and d) cultivable microbial density within 11-13 years. More importantly, the recovery time of the disturbed moss-biocrusts estimated by the number of bacteria and fungi was similar to 10 and 20 years, respectively, and that estimated by the bacterial and fungal community diversity was 12-14 and 12-16 years, respectively. In conclusion, moss biocrusts would take 15-20 years to achieve full recovery, which was shorter than many previously published estimates that regarded biocrusts and especially moss-dominated biocrusts to have a long recovery time of hundreds of years. However, it should be also kept in mind that very fast recovery ( < 5 years) of biocrusts was less reliable because such estimations are mostly based on visual cover only rather than on the multi-variables of the recovering biocrusts.

J	Li, XZ; Shao, MA; Xu, XL; Wang, KL				Li, Xuezhang; Shao, Ming'an; Xu, Xianli; Wang, Kelin			Improving prediction accuracy of soil water storage through reducing sampling frequency	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												Knowledge of spatiotemporal dynamics of soil water storage (SWS) is essential for hydrological modeling and vegetation restoration in semi-arid areas. However, characterizing the temporal stability of SWS at a regional scale requires time-consuming and labor-intensive manual sampling. Moreover, the influence of soil depth on temporal stability of SWS is not systematic. This study aimed to investigate the influences of sampling frequency and soil depth on SWS and SWS temporal stability. We measured soil moisture at 20-cm intervals in the soil profiles to a depth of 3 m using a neutron probe at 135 locations along a 1340-m long transect on 14 dates from 2012 to 2013. Results showed that sampling frequency did not influence the mean SWS (P < 0.05), while sampling frequency significantly affected temporal stability characteristics including Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r(s)), standard deviation of mean relative difference (SDRD), the number of locations with SDRD < 5%, and the representative locations. Temporal stability of SWS increased with the increasing soil thickness and depth, which increases the possibility of the number of representative locations in deep soil. Although the mean SWSs of all soil depths can be predicted accurately at each sampling frequency, the prediction accuracy improved when sampling frequency was reducing. The values of R-2 ranged from 0.769 to 0.978 at 15-day sampling frequency, and from 0.987 to 0.998 at 45-day sampling frequency. Soil moisture stability may be more important than the soil water regime during prediction of soil moisture. These findings can provide guidelines for optimizing soil moisture sampling strategies and benefit management of water resources in semiarid watershed.					liang, shuang/JOK-5869-2023; xu, xian/IYS-8236-2023; He, Chen/JLM-5059-2023; Xu, Xianli/B-8382-2009	Xu, Xianli/0000-0002-6315-6083													1161-0301	1873-7331				MAY	2022	136								126502	10.1016/j.eja.2022.126502	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2022.126502		MAR 2022											WOS:000791939800003

Exploring the agricultural landscape diversity-food security nexus: an analysis in two contrasted parklands of Central Senegal	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												CONTEXT: Fostering diversity within agricultural systems can substantially contribute to improved food security among smallholder farmers. Agroforestry parklands are diverse agricultural landscapes where trees can provide an array of ecosystem services. Previous studies analyzing the agricultural landscape diversity-food security nexus in agroforestry parklands have only considered tree cover. OBJECTIVE: We propose an original empirical approach that combines the analysis of spatial data on agricultural landscape diversity with agricultural field monitoring and household surveys. These three sources of data were used to scrutinize the direct and indirect contributions of agricultural landscape diversity to food availability and food access. METHODS: Millet yield was used as a proxy for food availability, and household food access was approximated using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) indicator. Two contrasted agroforestry parklands of Central Senegal were chosen as case studies. Firstly, we used a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) algorithm to disentangle the relative contribution of landscape diversity, biophysical and crop management variables in explaining millet yield variability. Secondly, we investigated the pathways linking agricultural landscape di-versity to HFIAS using a Correlation Network Analysis (CNA). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The GBM model explained 77% and 84% of millet yield variability for the two parklands, respectively, with landscape diversity variables accounting for 53% and 47% of relative influence. Among the landscape diversity variables, tree species richness and tree density were the most important ones. Millet yield was positively associated with tree density in the Nioro site until a threshold of 5 trees/ha, and with tree species richness in the two sites. The CNA showed that greater tree cover and larger tree patches were moderately correlated with HFIAS. This suggests that tree species with large crown, as it the case for most fruit bearing tree species in the region, are the main species contributing directly to food access. Agricultural land-scape diversity contributed mainly indirectly to household food access through an "agroecological pathway", i.e. by the provision of ecosystem services regulating and supporting crop production. SIGNIFICANCE: Using an integrated landscape approach relying on up-to-date remote sensing data and recent advances in data analysis methods, our study shows that tree species diversity matters as much as the amount of tree cover for the production of food, and it can contribute to improve food security. We bring a more nuanced picture of the contribution of agricultural landscape diversity to food security suggesting that land management policies supporting food security should consider both tree density and tree species diversity to optimize the co -benefits of trees for the different food security dimensions.

This suggests that research methods for studying farmers' seed demand are not yielding information that reflects the real-life decisions and behaviours of farmers in the choice and acquisition of their seeds. We suggest that research methods for analysing farmers' seed demand shape seed availability. This is supported by the theory of social life of methods. We argue that access to and attractiveness of seed are highly context-specific for a farmer, for example, influenced by his/her social position, the role of the crop or variety in the farming system, the linkage to the market, agro-ecological conditions, and that context is highly variable. We also argue that many of our research methods are weak on capturing real-life context and provide fragmented snapshot-nature understanding and biases of farmers preferences and needs for seeds. We call for more integrated understanding of seed systems as a whole and a more holistic methodological research approach that better captures the variable real-life context of farmers while providing the metrics that are needed by seed actors and policymakers to enable informed decisions.

J	Fu, BJ				Fu, Bojie			Ecological and environmental effects of land-use changes in the Loess Plateau of China	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE												The Loess Plateau (LP) is a typical ecologically fragile area in China, with severe water shortage and soil erosion. Understanding the interactions between land use structure and ecological processes is the basis for effective soil and water conservation. Since the implementation of large-scale vegetation restoration programs, changes in carbon and water services, as well as trade-offs in these services have become a new scientific challenge in this region. A comprehensive analytical paradigm of "pattern-process-service" was developed by our research group to determine the ecological and environmental effects of land-use changes and support ecological restoration practices. First, by combining landscape pattern, ecological process, and scale, we studied the effects of land-use changes on soil moisture, nutrients, and erosion at multiple spatial scales of plot, transect, catchment, and region, and illustrated the mechanisms of the interactions between land-use structure and ecological processes in the LP systematically. These works have revealed the relationships among ecosystem structure, land-use structure, vegetation functional traits, vegetation biomass, ecological processes (e.g., hydrological processes and nutrient cycling) and ecosystem services. They have also identified the key roles of soil water content and understory plant diversity in ecosystem service maintenance in dryland ecosystems. Second, by linking ecological processes and ecosystem services, we studied the formation and interaction mechanisms of ecosystem services. A sediment attribution diagnostic method focusing on soil retention services was developed to diagnose the contributions of multiple factors to changes in the sediment loads of rivers. Application of this method quantitatively revealed the drivers (climate change, vegetation restoration, and ecological engineering) and mechanisms underlying the drastic reduction in the sediment load of the Yellow River over the past 60 years. The trade-off between carbon sequestration and water yield was quantitatively revealed, and its temporal and spatial variations during vegetation restoration were detected. The threshold of forest restoration potential within the limit of annual precipitation, as well as the turning point from soil carbon source to soil carbon sink following farmland abandonment, was identified. By considering water consumption for both vegetation growth and socioeconomic uses, a quantitative coupling analysis framework for the sustainable use of water resources in the natural-social-economic system of the LP was constructed, and regional water-resource carrying capacities for vegetation restoration in the region under various scenarios were determined; the results suggest that current vegetation restoration is approaching sustainable water resource limits. Third, on the basis of an understanding of the relationships between ecosystem processes and services at multiple scales, a spatially explicit assessment and optimization tool for regional ecosystem services was developed to reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics of ecosystem services on the LP, including water yield, soil retention, carbon sequestration, and grain production. By combining scenario analysis and ecosystem service quantification models with a spatial optimization algorithm, this new decision-supporting tool is capable of spatially optimizing multiple ecosystem services. This has contributed crucially to the advancement of integrated research into regional ecosystem services with the aim of quantifying, modeling, and supporting the rational planning and effective implementation of ecological projects. These findings have promoted the development of physical geography from qualitative structure description to quantitative process research. They have also led ecosystem services research into ecological processes and mechanisms and their comprehensive integration and have provided a key scientific basis for ecological restoration of the LP.																			0023-074X	2095-9419					2022	67	32					3768	3779		10.1360/TB-2022-0543	http://dx.doi.org/10.1360/TB-2022-0543													WOS:000899121000004

However, there is currently no information how leguminous plants damaged by the pod borer Maruca vitrata attract the exotic larval parasitoid Therophilus javanus, which was imported into Benin from the putative area of origin of the pod borer in tropical Asia for assessing its potential as a biological control agent. In this study, we used Y-tube olfactometer bioassays to investigate T. javanus response towards odors emitted by four M. vitrata-damaged host plants: cowpea Vigna unguiculata, the most important cultivated host, and the naturally occurring legumes Lonchocarpus sericeus, Sesbania rostrata and Tephrosia platycarpa. Olfactory attraction of T. javanus was influenced by the species of plant damaged by the pod borer. Moreover, odors released from M. vitrata-infested host plant organs (flowers and pods) were discriminated over non-infested organs in cowpea and T. platycarpa, respectively. These results are discussed in the context of the possible impact of M. vitrata host plants on T. javanus foraging activity and subsequent establishment in natural environments following experimental releases.

This will require instantaneous access to information on food-source quality at key points of agri-food systems. Although laboratory analysis and benchtop NIR spectrometers are regularly used to quantify grain quality, these do not suit all end users, for example, stakeholders in decentralized agri-food chains that are typical in emerging economies. Therefore, we explored benchtop and portable NIR instruments, and the methods that might aid these particular end uses. For this purpose, we generated NIR spectra for 328 grain samples from multiple cereals (finger millet, foxtail millet, maize, pearl millet, and sorghum) with a standard benchtop NIR spectrometer (DS2500, FOSS) and a novel portable NIR-based instrument (HL-EVT5, Hone). We explored classical deterministic methods (via winISI, FOSS), novel machine learning (ML)-driven methods (via Hone Create, Hone), and a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method for building the calibrations to predict grain protein out of the NIR spectra. All of the tested methods enabled us to build relevant calibrations out of both types of spectra (i.e., R-2 >= 0.90, RMSE <= 0.91, RPD >= 3.08). Generally, the calibration methods integrating the ML techniques tended to enhance the prediction capacity of the model. We also documented that the prediction of grain protein content based on the NIR spectra generated using the novel portable instrument (HL-EVT5, Hone) was highly relevant for quantitative protein predictions (R-2 = 0.91, RMSE = 0.97, RPD = 3.48). Thus, the presented findings lay the foundations for the expanded use of NIR spectroscopy in agricultural research, development, and trade.

The available definitions of land degradation, methods to measure it, and the pertinent measures are diverse and controversial. Desertification and land degradation in Iran are serious issues and need assessment and survey to realize a stable land management in different regions of the country. The land degradation assessment in dryland (LADA) project has been initiated by the FAO over the past few years. The project is an attempt to introduce a set of standard methods and instructions to assess land degradation processes, the factors, and the effects with participation of local communities and users. The main objective of the present study is to assess land degradation and the effects on development and geomorphological forms in the west of Iran (Ilam Province) using LADA model. To do this, MODIS spectroradiometer (MOD13Q1 (250 m) NDVI) was used to examine trends of vegetation changes. In addition, LANDSET 7 & 8 data were used to assess change trend of surface water resources and salinity (BI, SI). The data provided by piezometer stations were used to examine change trend of groundwater resources and soil sample and measure EC and PH of the soil from 2000 to 2017. The results showed that land degradation has been expanding from the west to the east all over the region under study in terms of NDVI plant coverage during the time period under study. As illustrated by the images, vegetation degradation was more severe in the west and southwest of the region under study in sub-basins West/East Abbas Plane, Mosian, and Chenaneh, in the west of the region and sub-basins Abdanan, Dehloran, Mehran, and Salehabad in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2017. Vegetation in these areas is low at all times. The change slope, change slope significance, 8-year predication of change trend, and vegetation change difference indices supported the findings. While changes in the surface water resources have been increasing with a slight slope due to construction of dams in the region, these changes have had no effect on preventing and controlling land degradation in the region, since these resources have been affected by the land degradation on the far west strip. Moreover, in terms of the groundwater resources level, out of 76 piezometric well, 49 well with negative water level changes and 27 well with positive water level changes were identified. This means that all the well with declining water level was on the west strip (sub-basins Mosian, Abdanan, Dehloran, and Mehran). However, ascending wells are mostly concentrated in in the sub-basins east and west of Dasht Abbas-i.e., the southwest of the region under study. The ascending water levels in these wells can be explained by expansion of Karkhe water grid and less demand for the ground water in the region. Salinity and brightness indices assessments and soil lab results showed the lands with maximum salinity index and 100% soil degradation were at the west strip of the region or the west and south of Ilam Province (Mehran, Mosian, Abdanan, West/East Dasht Abbas, and Moulab). Eventually, land degradation and its effects on formation of geomorphological forms in the region were examined. The results revealed that land degradation in the west and southwest strip of the region, where the degradation is critical, has created specific geomorphological forms such as gully erosion.

Genetic control of rhizosheath formation in pearl millet	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The rhizosheath, the layer of soil that adheres strongly to roots, influences water and nutrients acquisition. Pearl millet is a cereal crop that plays a major role for food security in arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa and India. We previously showed that root-adhering soil mass is a heritable trait in pearl millet and that it correlates with changes in rhizosphere microbiota structure and functions. Here, we studied the correlation between root-adhering soil mass and root hair development, root architecture, and symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and we analysed the genetic control of this trait using genome wide association (GWAS) combined with bulk segregant analysis and gene expression studies. Root-adhering soil mass was weakly correlated only to root hairs traits in pearl millet. Twelve QTLs for rhizosheath formation were identified by GWAS. Bulk segregant analysis on a biparental population validated five of these QTLs. Combining genetics with a comparison of global gene expression in the root tip of contrasted inbred lines revealed candidate genes that might control rhizosheath formation in pearl millet. Our study indicates that rhizosheath formation is under complex genetic control in pearl millet and suggests that it is mainly regulated by root exudation.

To determine whether soil water balance and economic returns could be manipulated through maize-potato rotation. The effects of 1) continuous maize cropping (M), 2) continuous potato cropping (P) and 3) maize-potato rotation (R) on the variation in soil water content, water consumption, biomass and yield, economic benefits, and water economic yield were investigated. The depth of soil water consumption reached the maximum in 2016 (a dry year), at 260 cm, 200 cm, and 200 cm in M, P, and R, respectively. Compared with soil water storage in the 0-280 cm before planting in 2013, those after six years of cultivation were decreased by 186.31 mm in M, increased by 42.20 mm in P, and increased by 11.29 mm in R. R increased the post-flowering/total depletion% by 16.81-44.65%, the post-flowering/total biomass percentage by 10.83-24.83%, and water use efficiency of grain/tubers by 15.52-23.39% in 2016-2018, compared with M. Compared with M, R and P increased the total benefit by 55.44% and 41.62%, decreased ET by 10.69% and 17.93%, and increased EWUE by 74.02% and 72.52%, respectively. However, tuber yield and the water use efficiency of tubers in P decreased by 31.19% and 16.78%, respectively, from 2014-2017. Treatment R maintained the soil water balance, alleviated the over-consumption of deep soil water caused by continuous maize cropping, and reduced the decline in soil productivity caused by continuous potato cropping.						, hongli/0000-0002-3115-6863; Xucheng, Zhang/0000-0001-5210-0730													0002-1962	1435-0645				JAN	2021	113	1					645	656		10.1002/agj2.20434	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.20434													WOS:000620705300052

In this study, we investigated the phytotoxicity of N-BC and the detoxification strategy of wheat. Results indicated that the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in biochar (BC) was derived from environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs). However, N-doping induced the generation of heterocyclic-N and O-containing functional groups on the N-BC surface, which were critical factors for ROS production in N-BC instead of EPFRs. More importantly, heterocyclic-N and O-containing functional groups possessed a stronger ability for ROS generation, causing more severe phytotoxicity (ANOVA, P < 0.05). To counteract the phytotoxicity caused by N-BC, the detoxification strategy of wheat, such as the increase of antioxidant enzyme activities and photosynthesis pigments, was activated to alleviate the stress induced by ROS in vivo (ANOVA, P < 0.05). A split-root experiment demonstrated that N-BC-triggered detoxification of wheat proceeded by promoting the release of amines and/or producing new root exudates, thereby recruiting a group of beneficial microbiota with disease-resisting and growth-promoting (including Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes) properties to accumulate in wheat rhizospheres. These findings provide a novel perception to assess the safe application of N-BC on agroecosystems.

Thirty castrated male Bali-Bali sheep were randomly assigned to five treatments. Four dual-purpose millet varieties and one local variety-Somno were used. Sheep were fed ad libitum for 90 days with the stover of five millet varieties, complemented with cowpea hay. Stover of varieties ICMV167005 and ICMV167002 showed a tendency for a higher nitrogen content (1.0%) and in vitro digestibility (51.3% and 51.8%, respectively) compared to stover of other varieties. Significant differences were observed in average daily live weight gain. The animals fed with stover of the variety ICMV167005 in their diet had higher average daily live weight gain compared with others. We conclude that ICMV167005 is a promising variety for improving the productive performance of sheep.

However, the heavy metals in sludge are retained in biochar after pyrolysis and may cause secondary pollution during its soil application. Herein, a fast copyrolysis method of activated sludge (AS) and apple branches (AT) was proposed to immobilize heavy metals while improving bio-oil yield. The results showed that the heavy metal release from the copyrolyzed biochar was markedly reduced compared with that from the biochar produced through the pyrolysis of AS alone (78% for Cr and 28% for Pb). The kinetic behavior of ion release from different biochars could be described by a first-order kinetic model. The excellent fixation of heavy metals was attributed to complexation by abundant oxygen-containing surface functional groups (-O-, =O, and -CHO) that were mainly donated by AT. Furthermore, high-temperature py-rolysis was conducive to the fixation of metals, and the release of Pb2+ and Cr3+ from the biochar pyrolyzed at 600 degrees C was approximately 2/3 and 1/10 of that from the biochar pyrolyzed at 400 degrees C, respectively. A growth experiment on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli revealed that the toxicity of the copyrolyzed biochar was greatly reduced. This work can provide a method for heavy metal fixation and simultaneous resource recovery from organic wastes.					wu, p/JDW-5015-2023														0301-4797	1095-8630				MAR 1	2023	329								117073	10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.117073	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.117073		DEC 2022						36549065					WOS:000909940400001

However, the effect of oxygen on the dynamic interface processes of NOM and delta-MnO2 remains unclear. This study systematically investigated the interactions between delta-MnO2 and fulvic acid (FA) under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. FA was transformed by delta-MnO2 via direct electron transfer and the generated reactive oxygen species (ROS). During the 32-day reaction, 79.8% of total organic carbon (TOC) in solution was removed under anaerobic conditions, unexpectedly higher than that under aerobic conditions (69.8%), suggesting that oxygen limitation was more conducive to the oxidative transformation of FA by delta-MnO2. The oxygen vacancies (OV) on the surface of delta-MnO2 were more exposed under anaerobic conditions, thus promoting the adsorption and transformation of FA as well as regeneration of the active sites. Additionally, the reaction of FA with delta-MnO2 weakened the strongly bonded lattice oxygen (O-latt), and the released O-latt was an important source of ROS. Interestingly, a part of organic carbon (OC) was preserved by forming MnCO3, which might be a novel mechanism for carbon preservation. These findings contribute to an improved understanding of the dynamic interface processes between MnO2 and NOM and provide new insights into the effects of oxygen limitation on the cycling and preservation of OC.

Answers Depend on How You Ask: A Case Study on Youth Aspirations in Kenya	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH												While there is a consensus that rural poverty has to be reduced, there are two opposing views on the role that agriculture can play in this regard: a "farm-based" and an "off-farm led" development paradigm where the respective other sector is merely a complementary income source during a transition period. The latter paradigm is supported by studies finding that rural youth in sub-Saharan Africa are not particularly interested in agriculture. However, policy discourse on youth in agriculture often situates their aspirations as either full-time farming or non-farming, thus either supporting or opposing one or the other of the two paradigms, while neglecting the shades of grey between these two extremes. Using a mixed-methods approach-a household survey and a narrative-based tool called SenseMaker-to collect data from both adults and youth in 261 households in rural Kenya, this study suggests that this categorical understanding needs to be revisited to inform rural development strategies based on the actual aspirations of rural youth.

For densely planted crops such as winter wheat, however, the ridges reduce planting area. Thus, optimal ridge and furrow configurations for winter wheat cultivation remain unknown. Here, we evaluated the effects of various ridge-furrow ratios on soil hydrothermal properties, winter wheat growth, yield, resource use efficiency, and profitability under different precipitation years (dry, normal, or wet years) in 2014-2017. A control (CK, conventional flat planting without mulching) and three different ridge-furrow ratios [40:60 (R40), 60:60 (R60), and 80:60 (R80)] were tested. Firstly, PRFRH increased soil water storage and temperature. The soil moisture content assumed a "bell-shaped" distribution which was centered on the planting furrow in the 0-80 cm range. The soil water storage increased with mulched-ridge width, but it will not significantly increase while the mulched-ridge width was too wide. The soil temperature of ridge also increased with mulched-ridge width, whereas the soil temperature decreased in furrow. Moreover, precipitation years had no obvious effect on soil water storage or temperature. Secondly, the dry matter accumulation was captured quite well by the Logistic (R-2 > 0.99). PPRFRH promoted the accumulation of dry matter and increased the winter wheat yield (17.7%), especially in dry year, which mitigated the impact of drought and maintained the yield. Similarly, dry matter accumulation and yield also increased with mulched-ridge width. In contrast, when the ridge was too wide, the effective duration of dry matter accumulation and the yield were reduced. Finally, PRFRH improved the utilization efficiency of water, precipitation and thermal. Nevertheless, the mulched-ridge width required for optimal water-related resource utilization was higher than that needed for optimal thermal utilization. Overall, our results suggest that a 60:60 cm ridge and furrow system can improve dry matter accumulation, crop yield, profitability, and hydrothermal use efficiency in winter wheat grown in the semi-arid regions.

Beyond the prediction of species distribution provided by the SDMs, this study aimed to analyze the spatial distribution of tree species diversity using SDMs. The study area is a Faidherbia albida parkland in Central Senegal. It is characterized by a tree-based farming system dominated by Faidherbia albida. Using a robust and representative dataset of 9258 tree species occurrence, we first determined by an SDM the current potential spatial distribution of the 16 main tree species forming the parkland. Specifically, using 6 SDM algorithms and applying several modeling techniques with different categories of predictor variables (e.g., climate, topography, soil properties and human impact) we benchmarked 576 SDMs to achieve best model predictions for tree species. Then, tree species diversity maps were created on the basis of the resulting SDM predictions. Finally, the spatial dynamics of tree species diversity were discussed in relation to landscape characteristics, including heterogeneity, composition and human impact. The results showed that there is no single 'best' SDM algorithm (among the 6 algorithms tested) or modeling approach for all species. Benchmarking several modeling techniques allowed strengthening SDM performance, achieving AUC values that ranged from 0.64 (intermediate accuracy) to 0.87 (very good accuracy). The spatial dynamics of tree species diversity is related to the landscape heterogeneity and composition. In the Sahelian agroforestry systems (AFS), tree diversity is sustained by anthropization. A significant negative correlation with the distance to the village was found, i.e. the closer you get to the village, the greater the diversity of trees. This study could be crucial for analyzing tree species diversity when abundance information is not available.					begue, agnes/A-5718-2011; Leroux, Louise/C-4722-2016	begue, agnes/0000-0002-9289-1052; Ndao, Babacar/0000-0001-9848-7459; Leroux, Louise/0000-0002-7631-2399													1470-160X	1872-7034				NOV	2022	144								109443	10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109443	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109443		SEP 2022											WOS:000864647000004

Our objective was to investigate the effects of hybrid and PD later than traditional time on irrigated corn performance in the Texas High Plains. A 2-yr field study was conducted using four (2013) to six (2014) hybrids and four PDs (mid-May [PD1], late May-early June [PD2], mid-June [PD3], and late June-early July [PD4]). In PD1 and PD2, long-season hybrids had greater yields (12-15 Mg ha(-1)) than short-season hybrids (9-13 Mg ha(-1)). In PD4, short-season hybrids (8-11 Mg ha(-1)) had yield advantage over long-season hybrids (4-10 Mg ha(-1)). Low yield at late planting was related to reduced biomass, harvest index, kernel weight, and kernel number. Seasonal evapotranspiration (ET) was only reported in 2013. The average ET over PDs was 767 mm in a long-season hybrid and 718 mm in a short-season hybrid. Late planting resulted in lower ET (600 mm in PD4 vs. 822 mm in PD1). Hybrid and PD did not affect water use efficiency (WUE) except for 33D53AM, which had low WUE in PD4 due to low yield with late planting of this long-season hybrid. This study demonstrated that high yield (similar to 15 Mg ha(-1)) and WUE (similar to 1.5 kg m(-3)) can be achieved with long-season hybrids when planted before mid-June, but short-season hybrids were a better choice after mid-June. With water limitations, further study is warranted on planting short-season hybrids after mid-June to reduce water use and irrigation.

Genetic resistance is required to ensure yield stability and reduce the use of insecticides, yet the available resistance sources are limited. In this study, three common bean populations containing a total of 558 genotypes were evaluated in different yield and BLCrV resistance trials under natural infection in the field. A genome-wide association study identified the locus BLC7.1 on chromosome Pv07 at 3.31 Mbp, explaining 8 to 16% of the phenotypic variation for BLCrV resistance. In comparison, whole-genome regression models explained 51 to 78% of the variation and identified the same region on Pv07 to confer resistance. The most significantly associated markers were located within the gene model Phvul.007G040400, which encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase subfamily III member and is likely to be involved in the innate immune response against the virus. The allelic diversity within this gene revealed five different haplotype groups, one of which was significantly associated with BLCrV resistance. As the same genome region was previously reported to be associated with resistance against other geminiviruses affecting common bean, our study highlights the role of previous breeding efforts for virus resistance in the accumulation of positive alleles against newly emerging viruses. In addition, we provide novel diagnostic single-nucleotide polymorphism markers for marker-assisted selection to exploit BLC7.1 for breeding against geminivirus diseases in one of the most important food crops worldwide.

Simulating three rainfall intensities of 2 mm/h (light rain), 6 mm/h (moderate rain) and 10 mm/h (heavy rain) at different interval times (0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h) to analyze variable regulation of the control effect, the photosynthetic pigment content and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of C. album after spraying mesotrione. With the extension of rainfall time interval, the inhibition rate of plant height, plant control effect and fresh weight control effect of C. album were gradually increased, the inhibition effect of rainfall on the efficacy was gradually decreased, at the same time, the contents of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids, the maximum photochemical quantum efficiency (Fv/Fm), the actual photochemical quantum yield (Y (II)) and quantum yield (Y (NO)) production of regular energy consumption of C. album were also increased, while the nonregulatory energy decreased gradually. The results showed that the contents of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b in leaves of C. album increased significantly by 35.63% and 35.38% compared with the control under the condition of simulating 6 mm/h in interval 1 hour. The study suggested that simulating 10 mm/h rainfall intensity had the greatest effect on C. album, the photosynthetic pigment content, Fv/Fm and Y (II) of leaves were significantly higher than those in the control groups under 0.5 h, 1 h and 2 h interval treatments. The carotenoid content was the lowest and Y (NO) was the largest under the 4 h interval treatment. As is displayed that rainfall reduced the weed control effect in the aspect of controlling C. album on mesotrione, which is partly contributed to increase photosynthetic pigment content and enhance the PS II photochemical activity. In conclusion, the rain intensity of <= 2 mm/h did not affect the control effect of mesotrione on C. album. At 6 mm/h within 1 h after treatment, the control effect of fresh weight was significantly reduced by more than 7.14%, and at 10 mm/h within 2 h, the control effect was significantly reduced by more than 14.78%.																			1932-6203						2022	17	6							e0267649	10.1371/journal.pone.0267649	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0267649								35657781					WOS:000843619700084

The Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) is widely used as the gold standard for diagnosis of leptospirosis. In this method, diluted patient serum is mixed with serotype-determined Leptospires, and the presence or absence of aggregation is determined under a dark-field microscope to calculate the antibody titer. Problems of the current MAT method are 1) a requirement of examining many specimens per sample, and 2) a need of distinguishing contaminants from true aggregates to accurately identify positivity. Therefore, increasing efficiency and accuracy are the key to refine MAT. It is possible to achieve efficiency and standardize accuracy at the same time by automating the decision-making process. In this study, we built an automatic identification algorithm of MAT using a machine learning method to determine agglutination within microscopic images. The machine learned the features from 316 positive and 230 negative MAT images created with sera of Leptospira-infected (positive) and non-infected (negative) hamsters, respectively. In addition to the acquired original images, wavelet-transformed images were also considered as features. We utilized a support vector machine (SVM) as a proposed decision method. We validated the trained SVMs with 210 positive and 154 negative images. When the features were obtained from original or wavelet-transformed images, all negative images were misjudged as positive, and the classification performance was very low with sensitivity of 1 and specificity of 0. In contrast, when the histograms of wavelet coefficients were used as features, the performance was greatly improved with sensitivity of 0.99 and specificity of 0.99. We confirmed that the current algorithm judges the positive or negative of agglutinations in MAT images and gives the further possibility of automatizing MAT procedure.

Identification of stable heat tolerance QTLs using inter-specific recombinant inbred line population derived from GPF 2 and ILWC 292	PLOS ONE												Heat stress during reproductive stages has been leading to significant yield losses in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.). With an aim of identifying the genomic regions or QTLs responsible for heat tolerance, 187 F-8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross GPF 2 (heat tolerant) x ILWC 292 (heat sensitive) were evaluated under late-sown irrigated (January-May) and timely-sown irrigated environments (November-April) at Ludhiana and Faridkot in Punjab, India for 13 heat tolerance related traits. The pooled ANOVA for both locations for the traits namely days to germination (DG), days to flowering initiation (DFI), days to 50% flowering (DFF), days to 100% flowering (DHF), plant height (PH), pods per plant (NPP), biomass (BIO), grain yield (YLD), 100-seed weight (HSW), harvest index (HI), membrane permeability index (MPI), relative leaf water content (RLWC) and pollen viability (PV)) showed a highly significant difference in RILs. The phenotyping data coupled with the genetic map comprising of 1365 ddRAD-Seq based SNP markers were used for identifying the QTLs for heat tolerance. Composite interval mapping provided a total of 28 and 23 QTLs, respectively at Ludhiana and Faridkot locations. Of these, 13 consensus QTLs for DG, DFI, DFF, DHF, PH, YLD, and MPI have been identified at both locations. Four QTL clusters containing QTLs for multiple traits were identified on the same genomic region at both locations. Stable QTLs for days to flowering can be one of the major factors for providing heat tolerance as early flowering has an advantage of more seed setting due to a comparatively longer reproductive period. Identified QTLs can be used in genomics-assisted breeding to develop heat stress-tolerant high yielding chickpea cultivars.

Spatial estimation and climate projected change of cover-management factor in semi-arid region of India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES												Soil erosion and its future projection play an important role in the changing climatic scenario. An attempt has been made to establish a relationship between NDVI and cover-management factor (C-factor) which varies with area and crop. IRS LISS III data with 23.5 m resolution is used to derive precisely NDVI and correlated with C-factor, the derived regression equation shows a good relationship between NDVI and C-factor value. An approach was made to use this area specific equation for getting C- factor for the whole Mahabubnagar district, Telangana from 2013 imagery data and the study was conducted in 2017. For future scenarios study, a relationship between rainfall, temperature, and NDVI of the whole district was derived. The NDVI value of the study area varies between 0.63 and 0.046. Based on the regression model C-factor for the future scenarios using available CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-5) has been mapped for the whole district. Using the NDVI map, the C-factor map of the area was prepared in ArcGIS 10.0 software. The spatial distribution shows that the C-factor values varied between 0.52-0.86. On an average C- factor for 2020s, 2050s and in 2080s were 0.53, 0.76, and 0.77 respectively. The predicted C- factor values were then brought under the GIS environment and C- factor prediction maps were generated.					, Pushpanjali/P-6350-2018; Samuel, josily/AAD-8878-2022	, Pushpanjali/0000-0002-3213-2839; Samuel, josily/0000-0003-0161-2175													0019-5022	2394-3319				APR	2021	91	4					521	525																WOS:000674347700005

The experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of pregnant mare serum gonadotropins (PMSGs) and prostaglandin (PGF2 alpha) hormones on the oestrus response, conception rate, and kidding rate during the lower breeding season of the Abergele goat breed. A total of 77 Abergele does (25 for PMSG and 52 for PGF2 alpha protocols) were used for the experiment. Experimental animals were allowed to graze (does) for approximately 8 hours and (bucks) for approximately 4 hours, followed by supplementation with a mixture of 300 to 350 g cowpea hay and wheat bran per day. For PMSG-treated does, a vaginal sponge impregnated with progesterone hormone was inserted and stayed for 12 days. After the removal of the vaginal sponge, 2 ml (400 IU) of PMSG hormone was injected for 25 does and allowed to be mated by selected bucks after 48 hours. While a single injection of PGF2 alpha hormone was administered for 52 does and allowed for mating after 48 hours of hormone administration. The PMSG and PGF2 alpha protocols resulted in estrus responses of 96% and 86.5%, respectively. The conception and kidding rates of does administered with the PGF2 alpha protocol were better, with values of 57.7% and 55.8%, respectively. From the result, it was concluded that Abergele does were better responsive to both prostaglandins and gonadotropin-based protocols in inducing estrus, which can be used as an alternative approach for the improvement of the reproductive performance of goats. However, for the reason of better conception efficiency, kidding rate, and ease of application, the PGF2 alpha protocol was found to be better responsive and effective for synchronizing Abergele does during the lower breeding season.																			2356-654X	2314-7539				SEP 19	2022	2022								7691752	10.1155/2022/7691752	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/7691752													WOS:000863438300001

They establish ectomycorrhizal symbiotic relationships with diverse host tree roots and produce hypogeous ascomata. Their whole life cycle is closely related to their associated microbiome. However, whether truffle-associated compartments or host tree rhizospheres are the vital driver for truffle ascomata microbiome is unclear. To identify and compare fungal and bacterial communities in four truffle-associated compartments (Tuber indicum: bulk soil, adhering soil to peridium, peridium, and gleba) from three host trees, we sequenced their ITS (fungal) and 165 (bacterial) ribosomal DNA using the Illumina MiSeq high-throughput platform. We further applied the amplicon data to analyze the core microbiome and microbial ecological networks. Tuber indicum microbiome composition was strongly driven by its associated compartments rather than by their symbiotic host trees. Truffle microbiome was bacteria dominated, and its bacterial community formed a substantially more complex interacting network compared to that of the fungal community. The core fungal community changed from Basidiomycota dominated (bulk soil) to Rozellomycota dominated (interphase soil); the core bacterial community shifted from Bacteroideres to Proteobacteria dominance from truffle peridium to gleba tissue. Especially, at the truffle and soil interphase, the niche-based selection of truffle microbiome was verified by (i) a clear exclusion of four bacterial phyla (Rokubacteria, Nitrospirae, Chloroflexi, and Planctomycetes) in gleba; (ii) a significant decrease in alpha-diversity (as revealed by Chao 1, Shannon, and Simpson indices); and (iii) the complexity of the network substantially decreased from bulk soil to soil-truffle interphase and further to the peridium and gleba. The network analysis of microbiome showed that the microbial positive interactions were higher in truffle tissues than in both bulk soil and peridium-adhering soil and that Cupriavidus, Brodyrhizobium, Aminobacter, and Mesorhizobium spp. were the keystone network hubs in the truffle gleba. This study provides insights into the factors that drive the truffle microbiome dynamics and the recruitment and function of the microbiome components. IMPORTANCE Currently, the factors that drive the microbiome associated with truffles, the most highly prized fungi in the world, are largely unknown. We demonstrate for the first time here that truffle microbiome composition is strongly driven by associated compartments rather than by symbiotic host trees. The truffle microbiome was bacteria dominated, and its bacterial community formed a substantially more complex (with the higher numbers of nodes, links, and modules) interacting network compared to that of the fungal community. Network analysis showed a higher number of positive microbial interactions with each other in truffle tissues than in both bulk soil and peridium-adhering soil. For the first time, the fungal community structure associated with truffles using high-throughput sequencing, microbial networks, and keystone species analyses is presented. This study provides novel insights into the factors that drive the truffle microbiome dynamics and the recruitment and function of the microbiome components, showing that they are more complex than previously thought.

Impact of water deficit stress on traits influencing the drought tolerance and yield of maize (Zea mays L.) genotypes	PLANT PHYSIOLOGY REPORTS												Water deficit stress is one of the major abiotic stresses that severely affects the plant performance and production especially when it occurs during the reproductive phase. That drought research is an ongoing approach as new breeding lines development is a continuous process. Therefore, a field experiment was conducted with recently developed 12 maize (Zea mays L.) genotypes under Well Water (WW) and Water Deficit stress (WDS) conditions to quantify the impact of WD stress on phenological, physio-biochemical and yield parameters. The results showed that WD stress significantly altered the Anthesis Silking Interval (ASI) among the genotypes but had no effect on the genotypes DTL-4-1 and Harsha. A significant decrease in net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate and WUE was recorded with WD stress. Accumulation of proline under WD stress was significantly higher with DTL-4-1 and Harsha with a lower malondialdehyde (MDA) content and increased activity of SOD thereby maintained better cell membrane stability (CMS). Biomass and grain yield components were also significantly impacted by the water deficit stress. Among the maize genotypes, DTL-4, DTL-4-1 and Harsha showed better Stress tolerance index (STI). Under WD stress, grain yield showed significant positive association with proline, CMS, kernel number while negative association with MDA and ASI, indicating importance of these traits in imparting WD stress tolerance in maize.																			2662-253X	2662-2548				MAR	2022	27	1					109	118		10.1007/s40502-021-00640-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40502-021-00640-x		JAN 2022											WOS:000749243400001

Impact of climate change on productivity of food crops: a sub-national level assessment for India	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS												Climate change is considered as a potential threat to sustainability of agriculture in India. Considering the importance of agriculture in the pursuit of the India's development objectives, including the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, understanding possible impacts of climate change on productivity of major food crops in the country assumes importance in developing appropriate policies and programmes for agricultural technology development and transfer in general and for climate change adaptation in particular. Such an understanding at a scale where most of the development planning is done will be more useful in policy planning. This paper analysed climate change impacts at district level for major food crops using the district level climate projections for two time periods viz., mid-century (2021-2050) and end-century (2071-2098). Yields of most crops are projected to decrease in a majority of districts during mid-century period. The yield impacts are deeper and wider during end-century period. The yield impacts are relatively smaller and even positive in case of rapeseed & mustard and soybean. Some of the policy implications emerging from this study are: (i) Efforts are to be targeted and prioritized in the districts where the yields are likely to suffer more (ii) Concerns related to abiotic stress, especially those related to heat/temperature stress, need more attention in crop improvement and natural resource management programmes and (iii) Considering the dimension of climate change along with other bottlenecks to sustainable agriculture in the research and development process is a desirable way of mainstreaming climate change in to economic development programmes.

J	Adhanom, OG				Adhanom, Okubay Giday			Salinity and sodicity hazard characterization in major irrigated areas and irrigation water sources, Northern Ethiopia	COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE												Considerable area of land is becoming unproductive every year because of salinity and sodicity in Lowlands of Ethiopia. For sound land use and irrigation water management, it is a paramount important to know the salinity/sodicity status of soils and irrigation water quality. Therefore, the study was conducted to characterize and classify the salinity and sodicity hazards of major irrigated areas and irrigation water sources in Northern Ethiopia. Irrigation water samples were also collected from both sources used for irrigation in the study area. Moreover, representative soil profiles were also opened and soil samples were collected and analyzed. The Shwarobit river and the groundwater sources were found to be in the medium (C-2) (341.7 ?S/cm) and high (C (3)) (1452.9 ?S/cm) salinity hazards, respectively. With regards to the sodicity hazard criteria, both water sources were found to be low (S1). According to the US Salinity Laboratory Staff criteria, soils irrigated by the Shwarobit River met the criteria to be classified as saline soils. However, except the surface layer of the profile the soils irrigated by a combination of shwarobit River and groundwater sources met the criteria to be classified as a saline-sodic soils. Therefore, according to the water and soil analysis results, there will be a potential danger of sodicity and actual salinity development in the intended irrigation scheme. Thus, selection of crop type and proper irrigation methods should be designed for sustainability of soil productivity in the study area.																			2331-1932					SEP 27	2019	5	1							1673110	10.1080/23311932.2019.1673110	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2019.1673110													WOS:000489848900001

However, simulating soil loss in response to these treatment strategies remains a challenge. The objective of this study was to test the performance of the single-event wind erosion evaluation program (SWEEP) in simulating soil loss from agricultural land under contrasting tillage, crop rotation, fertilizer, and green manure treatments in the iPNW. These management strategies appeared to impact residue characteristics but had little or no impact on soil properties except tillage treatments in the short term (<2 years). Tillage appeared to have a greater impact on soil properties and residue characteristics than other treatments. As a result, the performance of SWEEP varied among disk-tillage (DT), undercutter-tillage (UT), and NT (no-tillage/zero-tillage) treatments. No or little difference was found in the performance of SWEEP between winter wheat-summer fallow (WW-SF) and WW-oilseed-SF (WW-O-SF) crop rotations and synthetic and biosolids fertilizer treatments. In addition, the performance of SWEEP was acceptable for both crop rotation and fertilizer treatments. In contrast, poor agreement between simulated and measured erosion was found for manure treatments in which SWEEP over-estimated erosion by 313 and 210% for no manure and manure treatments, respectively. The over-estimation of SWEEP may be due to the over-estimation of abrasion flux from the fully crusted soil surface. Our results suggest that SWEEP can be used to identify control measures for windblown soil loss in the iPNW.

Fortified Groundnut Shells as a Soil Amendment for Improved Productivity in Oilseed Based Cropping System of Semi-arid Tropics (SAT) India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION												Soil degradation in semi-arid regions is alarming due to changed climate impacting the rainfall patterns and temperature affecting soil physico-biological properties adversely. In India, cattle shed bedding technology (CSBT) using crop residues is cheaper, easy-to-use residue recycling method for small holders in semi-arid regions. The present research work was carried out with a specific objective of soil improvement leading to resilience of land use system using indigenously available fortified crop residue for enhanced crop and cropping system yields under both rainy and post rainy conditions in semi-arid tropics of India. Thus, a study was conducted for 2 years (2013-2014 and 2014-2015) in the farmers fields with treatments having various fortifications like bedding material with groundnut shell and its manure, compost over existing practice among farmers on rainfed groundnut-fallow (L-F), castor-groundnut (NL-L) and groundnut-groundnut (L-L) oilseed based cropping systems. These systems were evaluated for soil quality parameters, productivity, fertility, soil moisture retention, compaction, crop land utilization and economics. In different cropping systems, use of fortified groundnut shell @ 16.3-22.6 t ha(-1) year(-1) was able to recoup the soil nutrient losses (183.0 kg N, 6.1 kg P, 227.0 kg K and 0.3 kg OC ha(-1) year(-1)) closely followed by compost and distantly by inorganics application with additional benefit of enhanced crop yields by 20.2-33.1% during subsequent rainy and 20.0-25.0% during post-rainy season, improved available water content (10.7-20.3%) and increased irrigation interval by 3-5 days in NL-L and L-L system. Hence, the principle of fortifying crop residues through CSBT could be utilized globally in similar agro-ecological regions for addressing soil degradation and effective crop residue utilization for small and marginal landholders farmers.

The parasitoid preference for the five larval instars of M. vitrata and their influence on progeny sex ratio were assessed together with the impact of larval host age at the time of oviposition on development time, mother longevity and offspring production. In a choice situation, female parasitoids preferred to oviposit in the first three larval instars. The development of immature stages of the parasitoid was observed inside three-day-old hosts, whereby the first two larval instars of T. javanus completed their development as endoparasites and the third larval instar as ectoparasite. The development time was faster when first larval instars (two- and three-day-old) of the host caterpillars were parasitized compared to second larval instar (four-day-old). The highest proportion of daughters (0.51) was observed when females were provided with four-day-old hosts. The lowest intrinsic rate of increase (r) (0.21 +/- 0.01), the lowest rate of increase (lambda) (1.23 +/- 0.01), and the lowest net reproductive rate (Ro) (35.93 +/- 6.51) were recorded on four-day-old hosts. These results are discussed in the light of optimizing mass rearing and release strategies.

Impact of Elevated CO<sub>2</sub>on Two Successive Generations of CO<sub>2</sub>Responsive Maize Genotype	AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												A CO2-responsive maize (Zea maysL.) genotype, Harsha, was selected to assess its response to elevated CO(2)in successive generation. The selfed seeds harvested from elevated CO2(eCO(2)) raised maize plants were sown in open-top chambers (OTCs) to raise second generation (H-II) plants along with fresh seeds as first generation (H-I) under both ambient (400 ppm) and elevated (550 ppm) CO2(eCO(2)) conditions. It was observed that second-generation (H-II) plants also showed improved performance under eCO(2)for morphological and physiological parameters. It is pertinent to mention that the H-II plants were more vigorous even under ambient CO2(aCO(2)) condition as compared to H-I plants. The vigor of H-II plants was higher for majority of the morphological and biomass parameters under both aCO(2)and eCO(2). In H-II, the increased photosynthetic rate (Anet) was 6% and decrease in transpiration rate (Tr) was 49%, which resulted in significant increase (110%) in water use efficiency. This reveals that the elevated CO(2)improved the physiological performance of the maize plant over the generations. These results clearly elucidate that a C(4)crop like maize can respond to elevated CO(2)and higher response in subsequent generations may favor the crop resilience under changed climatic conditions.

Genotype by Yield*Trait Biplot for Genotype Evaluation and Trait Profiles in Durum Wheat	CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS												Genotype selection based on multiple traits in multi-years is frequently influenced by unpredictable rainfed conditions. The main objective of the study was to apply the new methodology of genotype by yield*trait (GYT) biplot for genotype selection and trait profiles in durum wheat genotypes based on multi-traits and multi-year data under rainfed conditions of Iran. A superiority index was applied based on GYT table for ranking of genotypes by the mean of all traits. The GYT biplot ranked the genotypes based on their levels in combining yield with other key traits. Grain yield was combined with target traits and showed the strengths and weaknesses of each genotype. Based on GYT-biplots the relationships among the studied traits were not repeatable across years, but they facilitated visual genotype comparisons and selection. The breeding lines G13, G10 and G15 ranked as the best in combination of the morph-physiological traits i.e., SPAD-reading, early heading, flag-leaf length and number of grain per spike with grain yield under rainfed conditions. The results indicate that there is a potential for simultaneous improvement of some characteristics of durum wheat under rainfed conditions. The GYT biplot was a useful tool for exploring the combination of yield with traits and trait profiles of the durum genotypes to obtain high genetic gains in the durum breeding programs.

Usha; Deshpande, Santosh P.; Are, Ashok Kumar			Genome-Wide Association Study for Major Biofuel Traits in Sorghum Using Minicore Collection	PROTEIN AND PEPTIDE LETTERS												Background: Production of biofuels from lignocellulosic crop biomass is an alternative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The biofuel production involves collecting biomass, breaking down cell wall components followed by the conversion of sugars to ethanol. The lingo-cellulosic biomass comprises 40-50% cellulose, 20-30% hemicellulose, and 10-25% lignin. Sorghum is a widely adapted energy crop for biofuel production. Biomass with low lignin, high cellulose, and high hemicellulose contents are exploited to attain maximum biofuel production efficiency. Resistance to lodging, pest, disease, and abiotic stresses related to cell wall components is well documented, and quantitative trait loci were identified to understand these traits' genetic correlation. Selection for reduced lignin and increased cellulose content in stover can increase the ethanol yield. The Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) is a complementary approach to evaluating the marker and phenotype associations among large diversity panels. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were scanned to identify loci associated with the traits of interest. In this study, the GWAS was performed on 245 sorghum minicore genotypes to analyze agronomic traits (days to 50%flowering, fresh biomass yield, dry biomass yield) and cell wall components (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin). Further, in-silico validation of the candidate genes was performed in a global gene expression data from large-scale RNA sequencing studies in sorghum available in the NCBI GEO database was used. Objective: The objectives of this study are to evaluate native variations in biofuel related agronomic traits and stalk cell wall components and to identify significant SNPs or loci related to the cell wall components. Methods: In this article, an association mapping panel, comprising of 245 sorghum minicore germplasm accessions, was evaluated during two post rainy seasons of 2013 and 2014, and observations were recorded on the whole plot- for days to 50% flowering, fresh biomass yield (tha(-1)), and dry biomass yield (tha(-1)). The biomass of sun-dried plants from both seasons was collected separately, chopped, dried, and ground to powder. The cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin contents were determined in the powdered. The content of each of these three components in sorghum was expressed in percent of dry matter. The data on agronomic traits and composition analysis was subjected to Analysis of Variance. For the current study, we remapped the raw GBS data with the sorghum assembly version v3.1. A total of 27,589 SNPs were obtained with a minor allele frequency (MAF) >1% and missing data <50%. The GWAS was performed in a single minicore population using FarmCPU, in R software. The synteny positions of the identified significant SNPs between sorghum and other model crop species viz., maize, switchgrass, and Arabidopsis were represented using CIRCOS software for traits viz., dry biomass yield, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The transcriptome dataset from where sorghum gene atlas studies of grain, sweet, and bioenergy sorghums are available through NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE49879, was used to cross-validate the identified SNPs for cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin through GWAS. Results: High broad-sense heritability was exhibited for all the traits in individual seasons along with significant genotype x environment interaction across seasons except lignin. Association mapping with a P < 1x10(-4) revealed genomic regions associated with the- (i) agronomic traits (days to 50% flowering, fresh and dry biomass), and (ii) biochemical traits (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) associated with biofuels production, in individual seasons. Twelve significant SNPs for flowering time, 30 fresh biomass yields, and 24 for dry biomass yield, 25 for cellulose, 7 for hemicellulose, and 21 for lignin were identified. CIRCOS plot was constructed to identify and analyze similarities and differences while comparing the sorghum genome with different crops. For cellulose high similarity of >80% was observed for all sorghum gene sequences with the maize homologs. The overall similarity of sorghum homologs with foxtail millet was >65%, for Arabidopsis from 30.6% to 48.6%, and rice from 28.2% to 92.8%. SNPs for hemicellulose displayed maximum similarity to foxtail millet followed by maize. The sequence similarity of lignin SNPs in sorghum was highest with the maize genome followed by Arabidopsis. Both rice and foxtail millet showed >55% similarity to the sorghum genome. Conclusion: This study reports large variability for agronomic and biofuel traits in the sorghum minicore collection with high heritability. The genetic architecture of cell wall components using the GWAS approach was studied and candidate genes for each component were annotated. These results give a better understanding of the genetic basis of the sorghum cell wall composition. The association analysis identified regions of the genome that could be targeted to enhance the quality of biomass and yield along with the desired composition promoting breeding efficiency for enhanced biofuel yield.					kiranmayee, usha/R-8762-2017	Gupta, Rajeev/0000-0002-1451-215X; Rayaprolu, Laavanya/0000-0002-3557-7569													0929-8665	1875-5305					2021	28	8					909	928		10.2174/0929866528666210215141243	http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/0929866528666210215141243								33588716					WOS:000688135200006

Stress Reactions of Maize Genotypes to Drought Stress at Different Phenophases and Recovery	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY												Maize (Zea mays L.) cultivated worldwide, is often exposed to various biotic and abiotic stresses affecting productivity. We evaluated three maize genotypes, SNJ201126, Z10115 and HKI161 for morpho-physiological, biochemical and anti-oxidative enzyme related traits under well watered control and drought stress conditions. Plants were subjected to different intensity of drought stress inside rainout shelter. The genotypes SNJ201126 and Z10115 maintained higher relative water content, chlorophyll, proline and canopy temperature depression and higher activities of antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, guiacol peroxidase, and glutathione reductase as compared to HKI161 under stress conditions. All genotypes showed a decreasing trend for these traits with the increasing severity of stresses. Stress recovery was better in SNJ201126 and Z10115 when compared to HKI161. The variation in physiological and enzymatic activities between genotypes was also reflected in their differences in yield and its attributes. The higher drought tolerance and recovery capability of SNJ201126 and Z10115 were associated with more effective maintenance of leaf water status and efficient antioxidative systems to protect themselves from oxidative damage which is critical to withstand and survive the rapidly changing climate.

The Wardha river basin is covered by 1730.85 sq. km2 with dendritic and sub-dentric drainage patterns. This study area is delineated into nine sub-watersheds from digital elevation model data using Arc hydro tools. The morphometric characters were observed to understand the drainage and watershed characteristics and its impact on groundwater resources for the occurrence of bifurcation ratio that shows very high runoff and low infiltration of groundwater recharge at the basaltic terrain rocks. Slope and topographic maps may be used for groundwater development; theses maps can be used for suitable well points and artificial and ground water recharge sites at the Wardha river basin. The slope values were inversely proportional to infiltration and it has led to the hypsometric analysis using Arc GIS 10.3 software. In this study, different types of morphometric characteristics were measured using computations of linear and areal aspect using geospatial technology domain. The total streams order (3509) has been identified from digital elevation model data. The data show that large numbers of stream are present in this area for scope of water harvesting structures and these play a main role in groundwater development and controlling soil erosion factors. In this study, various morphometric parameter were calculated using mathematical equation and spatial data for understanding of surface runoff, slope, watershed characteristics and watershed condition. Hypsometric investigation has been generally used to reveal the steps of geomorphic growth or land forms. The hypsometric integral value shows nine sub-watersheds observed which shows the mature stage at the Wardha river basin. The hypsometric analysis results have been calculated for watershed and groundwater development. During the study, bifurcation ratio values such as 2.5-4.25 suggest morphological and the basic control for watershed management and drainage network analysis in the area, while drainage density and fine drainage texture suggest its high runoff in basin. The drainage basin characteristics have been made for the assessment of many linear factors such as stream order, stream number, stream length, stream length ratio, bifurcation ratio, drainage density, texture ratio, and stream frequency) and Channel index (Ci) Valley index (Vi), Rho coefficient (q) and Basin Area.

Poverty eradication and food security through agriculture in Africa: Rethinking objectives and entry points	OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE												Agriculture in Africa is expected to meet the dual objectives of providing food and helping people to escape poverty. African agriculture is dominated by smallholdings and donors generally target their agricultural support at the smallholder sector. The expectation is that if the gap between actual and potential yields can be closed, smallholders will grow sufficient crops to feed their families, with a surplus to sell, thus meeting food security needs and bringing in an income to move them out of poverty. In practice, this is often not possible. While technologies already exist that can raise smallholder farmers' yields 3 or 4 times, even under rainfed conditions, the small size of land available to them limits how much can be grown and the per capita income from agriculture is insufficient to allow people to move above the current World Bank-defined poverty line of US$1.90 per day. We link this finding with farmer typologies to further explain that there are large differences between individual farming households themselves in terms of their investment incentives and capability to benefit from field-level technologies that are aimed at increasing farm productivity. We argue for more differentiated policies for agricultural development in Africa and suggest that policymakers should be much more aware of the heterogeneity of farms and target interventions accordingly. It is important to understand where and for whom agriculture will have the main purpose of ensuring food and nutritional security and where and for whom there is the potential for significant increases in incomes and a contribution to wider economic growth. Let us recognize the distinctiveness of these targets and underlying target groups and work towards solutions that address the underlying needs.

Water Footprint (WF) assessment for rainfed crops on watershed scale is critical for water resource planning, development, efficient crop planning, and, better water use efficiency. A semi-arid tropical watershed was selected in lower Krishna river basin having a 4700 ha area in Telangana, India. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to estimate the water balance components of watershed like runoff, potential evapotranspiration, percolation, and effective rainfall for base period (1994 to 2013) and different climate change scenarios of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 for the time periods of 2020, 2050 and 2080. Green and blue WF of rainfed crops viz., maize, sorghum, groundnut, redgram and cotton were performed by considering rainfed, and two critical irrigations (CI) of 30 mm and 50 mm. It indicated that the effective rainfall (ER) is less than crop evapo-transpiration (ET) during crop growing period under different RCPs, time periods, and base period. The green WF under rainfed condition over different RCPs and time periods had decreasing trend for all crops. The study suggested that in the rainfed agro-ecosystems, the blue WF can significantly reduce the total WF by enhancing the productivity through critical irrigation management using on farm water resources developed through rainwater harvesting structures. The maximum significant reduction in WF over the base period was observed 13-16% under rainfed, 30-32% with 30 mm CI and 40-42% with 50 mm CI by 2080. Development of crop varieties particularly in oilseeds and pulses which have less WF and higher yields for unit of water consumed could be a solution for improving overall WF in the watersheds of SAT regions.

PLANTS-BASEL												Sorghum bicolor (L.) is one of the oldest crops cultivated by human beings which has been used in food and wine making. To understand the genetic diversity of sorghum breeding resources and further guide molecular-marker-assisted breeding, six yield-related traits were analyzed for 214 sorghum germplasm from all over the world, and 2,811,016 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) markers were produced by resequencing these germplasms. After controlling Q and K, QTLs were found to be related to the traits using three algorisms. Interestingly, an important QTL was found which may affect multiple traits in this study. It was the most likely candidate gene for the gene SORBI_3008G116500, which was a homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana gene-VIP5 found by analyzing the annotation of the gene in the LD block. The haplotype analysis showed that the SORBI_3008G116500(hap3) was the elite haplotype, and it only existed in Chinese germplasms. The traits were proven to be more associated with the SNPs of the SORBI_3008G116500 promoter through gene association studies. Overall, the QTLs and the genes identified in this study would benefit molecular-assisted yield breeding in sorghum.

In this study, a 3-year field trial (2016-2018) employed four treatments to investigate the mechanism by which humate increases carbon sequestration in fluvo-aquic soils: (1) blank: bare soil with no agricultural treatment; (2) control: standard film mulch (FM) ridge-furrow tillage (which acts as CK); (3) humate: FM tillage plus humate; and (4) straw: FM tillage plus straw. The three treatments strongly affected the soil carbon sequestration, with the humate and straw treatments more significant than the blank treatment. Moreover, the >= 2.0-mm macroaggregate fraction, >1-mm soil aggregate-associated carbon, weight mean diameter (MWD) and geometric mean diameter (GMD), and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) values for the straw and humate treatments were all significantly increased (p < 0.05), increasing the carbon sequestration by 1.9 and 0.9 Mg C ha(-1)y(-1) compared to the control, respectively. Carbon sequestration was significantly associated with >1.0-mm aggregate-associated C, MWD, GMD, MBN, and organic C input. Humate and straw synergistically regulate the soil and microbial processes and greatly increase the straw C return to soil while efficiently increasing the macroaggregate fraction and stability, macroaggregate-associated carbon, and physical protection of aggregates, thereby increasing the carbon sequestration. Therefore, humate may be a novel economical alternative to straw to efficiently increase the carbon sequestration in dry fluvo-aquic soils.																				2073-4395				JUN	2022	12	6							1398	10.3390/agronomy12061398	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12061398													WOS:000819630900001

To combat the damage caused by H. armigera farmers rely heavily on pesticides which is not a benevolent practice, environmentally and economically. To provide a more effectual and precise information on timely application of insecticides, this research was intended to develop a forecast model to predict the future trend of pod borer population by means of pheromone trap catch using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMAX) and Artificial Neural Networks (NNARX) with weather parameters as exogeneous variables. Several ARIMAX (p, d, q) and NNARX models were fitted by using the historical trap catch input data in different combinations. ARIMAX (2,0,0) with maximum temperature and rainfall as external variables was selected as the best ARIMAX fit. The neural network (10-32-1) was found to be the best fit to predict the male moth catches of old world bollworm from September, 2021 to August, 2023. A comparative assessment of ARIMAX and NNARX, showed that the NNARX models were found best suit for effective pest prediction to suggest timely intervention of control measures with appropriate decision-making schedule for application of insecticides.

In RWS, both phosphorus (P) and zinc (Zn) deficiencies are considered important nutritional constraints for reducing rice crop growth rates (CGR) and total biomass/biological yield (BY). The objective of this experiment was to investigate the impact of phosphorus (0, 40, 80, 120 kg P ha(-1)) and zinc rates (0, 5, 10, 15 kg Zn ha(-1)) on CGR and BY of three rice genotypes [fine (Bamati-385) versus coarse (Fakhre-e-Malakand and Pukhraj)] in Northwestern Pakistan during summer 2011 (Y1) and 2012 (Y2). The results revealed that higher CGR at various growth stages and total BY was obtained with the integrated use of higher phosphorus (80 and 120 kg P ha(-1)) and zinc rates (10 and 15 kg Zn ha(-1)). The lower CGR and BY were recorded when P and Zn were not applied (control) or when P and Zn were applied alone. In the case of rice genotypes, the highest CGR and BY were recorded for the hybrid rice (Pukhraj) than the other two genotypes. The CGR was increased to the highest level at the heading stage as compared to tillering and physiological maturity. The increase in CGR had a positive impact on the total BY of rice cultivars. The increase in BY had a positive relationship with grain yield and grower's income. It was concluded from the study that the combined application of higher P and Zn rates to the coarse rice genotypes (Fakhre-e-Malakand and Pukhraj) could increase CGR, total BY, crop productivity and profitability.

Identifying appropriate prediction models for estimating hourly temperature over diverse agro-ecological regions of India	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The present study tests the accuracy of four models in estimating the hourly air temperatures in different agroecological regions of the country during two major crop seasons, kharif and rabi, by taking daily maximum and minimum temperatures as input. These methods that are being used in different crop growth simulation models were selected from the literature. To adjust the biases of estimated hourly temperature, three bias correction methods (Linear regression, Linear scaling and Quantile mapping) were used. When compared with the observed data, the estimated hourly temperature, after bias correction, is reasonably close to the observed during both kharif and rabi seasons. The bias-corrected Soygro model exhibited its good performance at 14 locations, followed by the WAVE model and Temperature models at 8 and 6 locations, respectively during the kharif season. In the case of rabi season, the bias-corrected Temperature model appears to be accurate at more locations (21), followed by WAVE and Soygro models at 4 and 2 locations, respectively. The pooled data analysis showed the least error between estimated (uncorrected and bias-corrected) and observed hourly temperature from 04 to 08 h during kharif season while it was 03 to 08 h during the rabi season. The results of the present study indicated that Soygro and Temperature models estimated hourly temperature with better accuracy at a majority of the locations situated in the agroecological regions representing different climates and soil types. Though the WAVE model worked well at some of the locations, estimation by the PL model was not up to the mark in both kharif and rabi seasons. Hence, Soygro and Temperature models can be used to estimate hourly temperature data during both kharif and rabi seasons, after the bias correction by the Linear Regression method. We believe that the application of the study would facilitate the usage of hourly temperature data instead of daily data which in turn improves the precision in predicting phenological events and bud dormancy breaks, chilling hour requirement etc.					; SARATH CHANDRAN, MA/ABG-3178-2021	Bal, Santanu Kumar/0000-0002-0521-1347; SARATH CHANDRAN, MA/0000-0002-0824-0426													2045-2322					MAY 13	2023	13	1							7789	10.1038/s41598-023-34194-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-34194-9								37179371					WOS:000989345000028

To prevent the damage caused by H. armigera farmers rely heavily on insecticides of diverse groups on a regular basis which is not a benign practice, environmentally and economically. To provide more efficient and accurate information on timely application of insecticides, this research was aimed to develop a forecast model to predict population dynamics of pod borer using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The data used in this study were collected from the randomly installed sex pheromone traps at International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Patancheru, Hyderabad. Several ARIMA (p, d, q) (P, D, Q) and ANN models were developed using the historical trap catch data. ARIMA model (1,0,1), (1,0,2) with minimal BIC, RMSE, MAPE, MAE, and MASE values and higher R-2 value (0.53) was selected as the best ARIMA fit model, and neural network (7-30-1) was found to be the best fit to predict the catches of male moths of pod borer from September 2021 to August 2023. A comparative analysis performed between the ARIMA and ANN, shows that the ANN based on feed forward neural networks is best suited for effective pest prediction. With the developed ARIMA model, it would be easier to predict H. armigera adult population dynamics round the year and timely intervention of control measures can be followed by appropriate decision-making schedule for insecticide application.

Ground based hyperspectral radiometry studies revealed significant difference in the reflectance spectra between healthy and thrip damaged vegetation. Space borne multispectral reflectance from Sentinel 2A satellite data of chilli thrip infested canopy has significant differences in red region (Band 4 - 664.6 nm), NIR region (Bands 5, 6, 7, 8 & 8A having central wavelengths at 704.1, 740.5, 782.8 & 832.8 nm, respectively) and SWIR region (Bands 11 & 12 having central wavelengths at 1613.7 and 2202.4 nm). In this study, an attempt was made to discriminate healthy and pest affected chilli crop in the multispectral satellite imagery using several multispectral vegetation indices. Of these, land surface water index, LSWI (p=0.018) and normalized difference water index, NDWI (p=0.001) were found significant. These indices were used to classify chilli fields in the satellite imagery into severe, moderate and healthy classes. Superior performance of LSWI over NDWI with overall accuracy of 93.80 and Kappa Coefficient of 0.89 was observed. Moran's Index was used to study the spatial distribution of chilli thrips and observed strong clustering (I= 0.9073, p=0.0001).																			0972-1665					DEC	2019	21	4					480	487																WOS:000595356100012

But long-term using of the saline water for irrigation would negatively affect soil properties and crop production, and the salinity of the irrigation water should be properly managed to reduce the risks. In this study, saline water with five levels of electrical conductivities (ECiw) at 1.3 (CK), 3.4, 7.1, 10.6, and 14.1 dS center dot m(-1) were used to irrigate winter wheat and summer maize with annual double cropping system in the North China Plain (NCP) from 2006 to 2019, to decide the threshold value for long-term using saline water. Crop yields and soil salinity were continuously examined from 2006 to 2019, and soil physicochemical properties were monitored in 2018 and 2019 after 12 years' saline water irrigation. Results showed that soil salinity in the 0-100 cm layer could be maintained at a low level using saline water with ECiw at 3.4 dS center dot m(-1). Soil salt accumulated in winter wheat seasons could be leached from the main root zone in the following summer maize seasons, which were rainy in this region due to the monsoon climate. No significant difference was observed in grain yields for treatment with ECiw at 3.4 dS center dot m(-1) compared to CK treatment. The electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract (ECe), soil pH, sodium adsorption ratio, and bulk density within the top soil layer of 0-30 cm increased with the increase in ECiw, whereas the soil organic carbon, porosity, macroaggregates (> 0.25 mm) content, and activities of catalase, urease and alkaline phosphatase decreased, indicating the long-term using saline water irrigation deteriorated soil properties. But the difference in soil properties between the treatment of ECiw at 3.4 dS center dot m(-1) and the CK was not apparent. There were reductions below 5% in relative grain yields and soil quality index (SQI) with ECiw lower than 3.17 and 3.10 dS center dot m(-1) compared with CK treatment, respectively. Comprehensive consideration to maintain a stable crop production and benign soil quality, ECiw of 3.10 dS center dot m(-1) for long-term saline water irrigation was recommended as the safe utilization threshold in the NCP.

We used a triple hurdle (TH) model to estimate the production and commercialisation of smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. In doing so, we account for the adoption of improved Cicer arietinum (chickpea) varieties on commercialisation using a three-wave panel data set. We estimate a correlated random effect model with a control function and find the adoption of improved chickpea to have a significant positive effect on smallholder commercialisation. Our findings that are robust over different specifications and identification strategies also support the role of transaction cost in driving market participation (MP). Finally, we argue that the TH model is a better fit to the commonly used double hurdle model for MP, when not all households in a population produce a particular crop.

The intrinsic rate of increase (rm), and finite rate of increase (>>) increased with increase in temperature from 15 degrees C to 30 degrees C and decreased with increase in temperature. Intrinsic rate of increase (rm), varied from 0.05 females/female/day at 15 degrees C to 0.17 females/female/day at 30 degrees C. S. litura population attained a maximum net reproductive rate 'R-o' (334.09 females/female/generation) and total fecundity (1041.88 individuals/ female/generation) at 27 degrees C temperature. Simulated life table parameters were used to determine indices such as the establishment risk index (ERI), the generation index (GI), and activity index (Al) by using the 'Population distribution and risk mapping' module of software during present and future climatic scenarios and significant increase in Al and ERI with higher GI at future (2050) climatic conditions compared to current (2000) climatic conditions indicating the strong suitability for establishment and survival of S.litura in India.																			0972-1665					MAR	2020	22	1					24	32																WOS:000595366700005
J	Assefa, A				Assefa, Ayalew			Prevalence of <i>Escherichia coli</i> O157:H7 in foods of animal origin in Ethiopia: A meta-analysis	COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE												Escherichia coli O157 is one of the causes of gastrointestinal diseases in developed countries causing millions of illness annually. The occurrence of Escherichia coli in foods of animal origin in Ethiopia is arguably high due to many reasons like illegal slaughtering of animals in open fields, unhygienic slaughter practices in the abattoirs, and the risk of disease due to this organism is high because of a widespread tradition of raw meat consumption. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to pool estimates of the prevalence of the organism in different foods of animal origin which is the first of its kind in the country. The literature search was conducted to identify all published articles reporting the prevalence of Escherichia coli in foods of animal origin. From all screened articles, nine studies were eligible for final systematic review and meta-analysis. Because substantial heterogeneity was expected, random-effects meta-analyses were carried out to pool the prevalence of the organism from different foods of animal origin. Prevalence of the organism was found to be 4% (95% CI = 3%-5%) in foods of animal origin. This systematic review and meta-analysis showed the level of contamination of foods of animal origin in Ethiopia is high indicating the need for immediate planning of mitigation strategies and detection methods to reduce its level and impact throughout the country.

However, despite the importance of this food crop, little research had been done on this topic. We describe results from a field experiment carried out during 2016-2017 in a semiarid area (104 degrees 36 ' E, 35 degrees 35 ' N), where potato crop was grown in a field with three tillage treatments: (a) vertical rotary sub-soiling to a depth of 40 cm (VRT), (b) sub-soiling to a depth of 40 cm (SS), and (c) traditional rotary tillage to a depth of 15 cm (TT as control). The results showed that the VRT decreased soil bulk density by 0.8-22.2 and 13.3-25.3% compared with SS and TT, respectively, leading to increased porosity (by 12.5-14.8 and 12.3-23.7%) and saturation water content (by 23.7-33.2 and 25.6-59.0%), together with reduced water content at wilting point (by 12.5-23.4 and 11.4-23.4%). This was equivalent to 23.7-33.2 and 25.2-59.0% increase in soil maximum available water (SMAW) of the soil profile down to 40-cm depth compared with SS and TT, respectively. The increased SMAW resulted in increased tuber yield by 156.8 and 47.8%, corresponding increases in water use efficiency by 92.3 and 19.2% in 2016 compared with SS and TT, respectively. The similar results were observed in 2017. Our results demonstrate that VRT was an effective technology to further increase water use efficiency and crop yield on top of plastic film mulching in semiarid rainfed area.																			0002-1962	1435-0645				JAN	2021	113	1					657	669		10.1002/agj2.20454	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.20454													WOS:000620705300053

In order to identify the plant-based resistance sources for millet head miner along with high grain Fe and Zn, we have screened forty pearl millet genotypes, using an artificial infestation method. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences in the genotypes tested for head miner resistance. The genotypes Gamoji, ICMP 177001, ICMP 177002, ICMV 177003, ICMV IS 90311, LCIC9702, Souna 3, ICMV IS 94206 and PE08043 exhibited antibiosis resistance mechanism toHeliocheilus albipunctellawith appreciable agronomy and grain yield when compared with the susceptible check ICMV IS 92222. The genotypes Faringuero, ICMV 167005, ICMV IS 99001, Sadore local, SOSAT-C88, and ICMP 177004 exhibited tolerance to head miner damage with good per se performance. The genotypes ICMP 177001, ICMP 177002, ICMV 177003, and Moro exhibited resistance to millet head miner and had consistent grain Fe content across seasons (ranging from 44 to 70 ppm). Association between the head miner resistance and morphological traits showed a positive and significant correlation of larval production index (%) with head miner damage (r = 0.59**). Grain Fe and Zn contents exhibited negative association with panicle length and grain yield indicating proper care should be taken in breeding for these traits. Hence, the identified resistance sources can be effectively utilized in breeding head miner resistant pearl millet OPV's/hybrids, with high grain yield including Fe and Zn concentrations, to overcome the hunger and malnutrition seen in populations living in the semi-arid tropics.

In this study, we investigated the impact of drought on crop productivity, farmer's employment and income. The difference-in-difference model (DID) and stepwise multiple linear regression (MLR) were employed to quantify the impact of adopting climate resilient technologies (CRTs) on farm household income during a drought. The factors influencing farm incomes were analyzed using MLR. The study used survey data collected from the drought prone district of Telangana, India. Sixty farmers each from a village adopted under the National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) program and a control village were interviewed. Primary data on the socio-economic characteristic of farmers, cropping pattern, income composition, productivity of major crops, employment and climate resilient interventions adopted by farmers were collected using a well-structured schedule. The results reveal that income crop cultivation was the major contributor to household income (60%) followed by livestock rearing. Farmers reported that droughts decreased the income from crops by 54 per cent and income from livestock rearing by 40 per cent. The farmers belonging to the climate resilient village had 35 per cent higher incomes compared to those in the control village and it was estimated to be Rs. 31,877/farm household/year during droughts using the DID estimate. Farm size, livestock possession, adoption of CRTs and investment in agriculture were the determining factors influencing farm income. Thus, farmers especially in drought prone regions need to be encouraged and supported to adopt cost effective, location specific climate resilient technologies.

Methods In this study, contrasting heat-sensitive and heat-tolerant lentil genotypes were grown in the absence (control) or presence of selenium (1, 2.5, 5.0 mg kg(-1) dry soil). At the onset of flowering, plants were subjected to combined heat and drought stress by moving in a controlled environment [32/20 degrees C day/night (12/12 h), 50% soil field capacity, 500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) light intensity, 65-70% RH] for 20 days, up to completion of maturity stress. Results The results revealed that lentil plants exposed to the combined stress + Se significantly increased endogenous leaf Se concentration, pod number (32-36% in sensitive, 19-24% in tolerant genotypes), and seed yield (21-35% in sensitive, 21-25% in tolerant genotypes), compared to the combined stress treatment alone. Se supplementation significantly improved leaf water status and osmolyte accumulation (such as proline, glycine betaine, and reducing sugars), which stabilized membranes and photosynthesis-related traits, enhanced the expression of various enzymatic (superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase) and non-enzymatic (ascorbate and reduced glutathione) antioxidants and flower function, and improved pollen function, pod set, pod number, and seed number. Conclusions Our study showed the potential benefits of using selenium as a supplement in the low-Se soils to protect against combined heat and drought stress in lentil.					Prasad, P.V.

The disease is caused by soil-borne spore-forming bacteria called Bacillus anthracis. A machine learning algorithm with the biomod2 package of R software was used to develop a predictive map for the Amhara regional state of Ethiopia. One hundred twenty-eight georeferenced confirmed outbreak reports of anthrax in livestock and 11 bioclimatic, eight soil characteristics, and three livestock density variables were used to train the model. The algorithm was set to run 3-fold with a total of 27 outputs for the nine selected models. An ensemble model was developed with ROC evaluation metrics set at 0.8. The ensemble model showed an improved performance than the individual models (KAPPA, TSS, and ROC values of 0.86, 0.93, and 0.99, respectively). Variables like annual precipitation (22.51 %), precipitation of warmest quarter (14.17 %), precipitation of wettest month (11.61 %), cattle density (9.67 %), sheep density (6.6 %), annual maximum temperature (6.17 %), altitude/elevation (5.24 %), and sand content (4.83 %) contributed the highest share in the ensemble model. The predicted suitable areas were primarily in the Central and Southern parts of the region. West Gojam and South Gondar zones were found highly suitable; while parts of Waghemira, North Wollo, and South Wollo were not significantly suitable. Besides, East Gojam, North Gondar, and Awi administrative zones were also reasonably suitable to Bacillus anthracis. The study can be used as a basis in the planning of prevention and control approaches of anthrax outbreaks in the region. Administrative zones like West Gojam, South Gondar, Awi, and East Gojam have to be prioritized as a risky-areas in the planning of preventive measures of anthrax in the region.

Farmers in this area need a simple tool to predict spring wheat grain yield and assess yield loss risk efficiently. The objectives of this study were to establish relations between water use and grain yield of spring wheat for predicting actual yield and attainable yield (water limited yield) under conventional management practice and mulching practices. Reference data during 19932013 and field experiment conducted from 1987 to 2011 were used to determine water use-yield production function and boundary function for spring wheat. Probability of achieving a given spring wheat grain yield threshold is determined based on available soil water content at sowing plus expected precipitation during growing season. Single linear equation was obtained with slope of 14.6 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) and x intercept at 126.3 mm for spring wheat water use-yield production function with different wheat varieties under varying climatic patterns. The slopes of the boundary function were 16.2 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) and 19.1 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) under conventional management practice and mulching practices, respectively. With increase of available soil water content at sowing, the probability of achieving at least 2000 and 4000 kg ha(-1) of spring wheat for actual and attainable yield increased under different agricultural management practices.

The traditional Pearson's correlation analysis can be used to identify the linear correlations at the measurement scale only. In this study, wavelet coherency analysis was used to investigate scale-specific relationships between SWS and selected controlling factors. SWS of 135 sampling locations were calculated along a 1,340-m long sampling transect established in a typical catchment on the Loess Plateau, China. The selected controlling factors were soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks); clay, silt, sand, and soil organic carbon (SOC) contents; elevation; and aboveground biomass (AGB). The spatial pattern of SWS measured in growing and nongrowing seasons and at different soil depths was similar. At all the sampling points, except for some locations in the depression area, SWS in the growing season was relatively greater than that in the nongrowing season. The influence of factors on SWS varied with scale, with soil Ks, clay and sand contents significantly correlated with SWS at large scales. Season and soil depth had no significant effect on scale-specific relationships between SWS and the controlling factors. The wavelet coherency analysis identified the type of correlation at different scales and locations. The outcomes of this study offer meaningful insights into the hydrological processes that can be observed in the Loess Plateau region and could have significant implications for future hydrological systems and water resources management.

Sammi			Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> ameliorate the negative effects of high temperature on groundnut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i>) - Studies under free-air temperature elevation	JOURNAL OF AGROMETEOROLOGY												Four groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) genotypes- Narayani, Dharani, K-6 and K-9 were assessed for growth and yield responses at elevated temperature of 3.0 +/- 0.5 degrees C above ambient canopy temperature (eT) and its interaction with elevated CO2 of 550 +/- 50ppm (eT+eCO(2)) under Free Air Temperature Elevation (FATE) facility. The study revealed that eT significantly decreased photosynthetic rate (A(net)) of all groundnut genotypes whereas eT+eCO(2) condition ameliorated the ill effects of eT. The impact of eT on A(net), was higher than transpiration rate (Tr) and this reflected in decreased WUE with all genotypes. WUE improved significantly at eT+eCO(2) with increased A(ne)t and decreased Tr. Increase in canopy temperature (eT) resulted decreased relative water content (RWC), cell membrane stability and increased osmotic potential, Malondialdehyde (MDA) content and accumulation of proline. Elevated CO2 along with eT (eT+eCO(2)) facilitated these parameters to recover to that of ambient controls, revealing the ameliorative effect of eCO(2). Similar responses were recorded for biomass and yield parameters. Among the selected groundnut genotypes, superior performance for seed yield at high temperature of >40 degrees C by K-9 was due to ability to maintain better reproductive capacity and Dharani was responsive to elevated CO2 even at high temperature, indicating the genotypic variability.																			0972-1665					DEC	2019	21	4					411	419																WOS:000595356100003

In this study, we developed a monthly water and salt balance model. The water balance model was built to obtain the water flux in the vertical layers and the water exchange between agricultural and non-agricultural areas. In the frozen period, the upward water flux from the groundwater was calculated using a function which considered the water table depth and the negative accumulated temperature, and the volume of groundwater entering the root zone was estimated by the thickness of the root zone and frozen depth. With regards to frozen soil, the model considered salt diffusion and expulsion as well as convection. Only four additional parameters were required to estimate the water and salt processes during the freeze-thaw period. Soil salinity and water table depth data from 1999 to 2018 were used to calibrate and validate the model in a seasonally frozen agricultural district in the Hetao Irrigation District (HID), China. The mean relative error (MRE) of water table depth and averaged soil salt content was-4.29 % and 8.65 %, and the root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.38 m and 0.02 g/100 g during the validation period of 2010-2018. The validated model was used to simulate future long-term soil salinity under different autumn irrigation. The results showed that increasing autumn irrigation water can decrease root zone soil salinity during the autumn irrigation period, but it has a limited effect on long-term annual average soil salinity. The groundwater table becomes shallower with increasing irrigation water in autumn, which results in greater upward salt in the adjacent freeze-thaw and crop-growing periods. This study offers a new perspective on reducing autumn irrigation in HID.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				FEB	2024	235								107701	10.1016/j.catena.2023.107701	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.107701		NOV 2023											WOS:001126223500001

However, the effect of this technique on deep soil moisture and rainfall utilization to enhance the crop yield is unclear. To investigate this, two field experiments (2016-2017) were set up with maize and potato as research objects. There were four tillage practices under RFMS for maize: (1) MVT, VRT to a depth of 40 cm; (2) MST, sub-soiling to a depth of 40 cm; (3) MTT, rotary tillage to a depth of 15 cm; and (4) MZT, zero tillage. There were three tillage practices under RFMS for potato: (1) PVT, VRT to a depth of 40 cm; (2) PST, sub-soiling to a depth of 40 cm; and (3) PTT, rotary tillage to a depth of 15 cm. Our results showed that the VRT under RFMS mainly significantly reduced soil water storage (SWS) in the 0-100 cm profile at the flowering stage, and SWS in the 100-300 cm profile of maize and SWS in the 100-200 cm profile of potato at the harvest stage compared with other tillage practices. This increased evapotranspiration (ET) throughout the whole growth stage and indicated that VRT promoted the utilization of deep soil water (below 100 cm) for maize and potato. The increase of ET and utilization of deep soil water contributed to promote crop growth, directly improved chlorophyll content, accelerated dry matter accumulation and prolonged the duration of the maximum dry matter accumulation rate, resulting in higher water use efficiency (WUE), harvest index (HI) and yield. The results suggested that VRT under RFMS improved WUE by 3.5-14.6%, HI by 2.8-23.85% and yield by 12.1-47.4% of maize compared to the other treatments and correspondingly by 18.9-92.3%, 1.6-29.6%, and 24.7-156.8% for potato. In addition, VRT significantly improved fallow efficiency by 56.3-133.1% and precipitation use efficiency (PUE) by 12.1-47.4% for maize, and correspondingly by 101.9-272.7% and 24.7-156.8% for potato, compared with other treatments. These data indicated VRT can improve the efficiency of precipitation preservation and utilization in RFMS. Overall, VRT can efficiently utilize deep soil moisture and rainfall to promote crop growth under RFMS,thereby, significantly increased maize and potato yields.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				SEP 1	2022	271								107767	10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107767	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107767													WOS:000827267900001

Three fruit load intensities (low, FL1; commercial, FL2; high, FL3) and two irrigation levels (W1 and W2, equal to and higher than the local irrigation regime, respectively) were applied in a 22-year-old date palm orchard in 2018-2019. Irrigation amount, fruit quality and yield were measured. Profitability for each treatment was analyzed with the ANSWER-APP. Higher fruit load resulted in higher yield and water productivity, but on the other hand led to reduced fruit physical properties (size and mass), regardless of the irrigation treatment. The improved fruit physical properties and net profits in W2 compared to W1 treatment in each fruit load group resulted from excess salt leaching in the root zone. Notably, trees under W2FL2 treatment were found to have highest net profits. It is concluded that adequate irrigation amounts contribute to net profits in date palm trees treated with high fruit load intensity under saline irrigation conditions.

J	Liu, JL; Huang, XY; Jiang, HB; Chen, H				Liu, Jianliang; Huang, Xinya; Jiang, Haibo; Chen, Huai			Sustaining yield and mitigating methane emissions from rice production with plastic film mulching technique	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Reducing water use and mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are two major challenges faced by paddy rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivation. Water-saving technologies, including controlled irrigation (CI), plastic film mulching (FM), and straw mulching (SM), have been increasingly adopted to improve rice production efficiency. However, few studies have comprehensively evaluated the effects of these practices on grain yield, water consumption, and GHG emissions relative to current farmer's practice (FP). The objective of this two-year field experiment performed in southwestern China was to quantify the effects of CI, FM, and SM (compared with the FP control) on rice grain yield, irrigation water input, water productivity, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, global warming potential (GWP), and GHG intensity (GHGI). The FM treatment produced grain yield similar to the FP treatment, but it significantly decreased the irrigation water input by 69.6%, and then markedly increased the water productivity from 5.9 to 7.0 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) to 12.9-13.1 kg ha(-1) mm(-1). Furthermore, the FM treatment significantly reduced CH 4 emissions (91.0-95.0%), resulting in a great decrease in GWP (36.7-51.4%) and GHGI (36.5-51.9%), although it markedly increased N2O emissions (90.9-206.9%) compared with the FP treatment. The CI and SM treatments also significantly increased water productivity and decreased CH4 emissions by reducing irrigation, but they caused yield reductions (9.5% and 14.5% on average, respectively) and showed no benefit to GHGI mitigation compared with the FP treatment. These results suggest that there is still great potential to further optimize the current FP practice, and FM is a preferable management option to save irrigation water and mitigate GHG emissions while maintaining grain yield in rice production.

Spray bioassays were performed with IJ-tg19 on Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) adults, third-instar nymphs of Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), and third-instar larvae of Plutella xylostella (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) to determine the pathogenicity of the isolate. The corrected mortality rates for all three pests were 100% when the conidia concentration was 1 x 10(6) conidia/ml, the lowest concentration in this study, and the median survival times (MST) were 4, 4, and 3 d. The MST shortens with increasing conidia concentration. The effects of laboratory culture conditions on the sporulation and growth of the isolate were also studied. This isolate had the greatest conidia production and fastest growth rate on malt extract agar medium at 25 degrees C. The amount of conidia produced had positive correlation to light duration, with the highest production at 24 hr light. The growth of mycelium can adapt to a moderately alkaline environment, but the optimum conidial production occurred at the pH of 7. Our finding and research will be useful in biocontrol programs that are considering using the new isolate of C. javanica against greenhouse pests.					ma, rui/JGE-4890-2023														0022-0493	1938-291X				FEB 10	2023	116	1			SI		98	107		10.1093/jee/toac199	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toac199		DEC 2022						36534984					WOS:000899753500001

Effect of Ascorbic Acid and Zinc on the Productivity of Sunflower (<i>Helianthus</i> <i>annuus</i> L.) under Saline Stress Conditions	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												SALTINESS is the most restricting factor for agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions, addition to zinc is deposited in forms not accessible to plants in calcareous soils. During the 2018 and 2019 seasons, two field experiments were conducted at the Desert Research Center, Agriculture Experimental Station at Ras-Sudr, South Sinai Governorate, Egypt. The impact of seed priming by soaking seeds in ascorbic acid at 0, 100, 200, and 300mg ASC/L and the soil application of zinc at the rates of 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24kg zinc sulfate/ha (ZnSO4) on sunflower yields and its attributes were studied. The results reported that plant height, head diameter, number of seeds/head, seed weight/head, seed index, biological, seed and oil yields, and seed oil content responded considerably to ascorbic acid (ASC) in both seasons. In this connection, sunflower seeds soaked in 200mg ASC/L was the potency practice compared to other treatments in both years. ZnSO4 significantly affected all the aforementioned traits in both seasons. In this regard, adding 12kg ZnSO4 ha(-1) gave the highest values for all the studied parameters, except for plant height, which recorded the highest value of 143.2 and 131.2 cm at 24kg ZnSO4 ha(-1), respectively as compared to non-ZnSO4 application in both seasons. The outcomes of this study suggest that soaking sunflower seeds in 200mg/L ASC alongside ZnSO4 fertilization at a rate of 12kg/ha could be used to alleviate the harmful effects of salinity stress and increase the sunflower yields.

Housekeeping genes are commonly used as reference genes but their expressions were variable depending on experimental conditions in many insect species studied. Here we report the identification and evaluation of 10 housekeeping genes in alligator weed flea beetle, Agasicles hygrophila Selman & Vogt (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), a biocontrol agent of alligator weed. The 10 housekeeping genes are: beta-actin (Actin), ribosomal protein L13A (PRL13a), succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A (SDHA), ribosomal protein S20 (RPS20), ribosomal protein S13 (RPS13), glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), TATA-box-binding protein (TBP), ribosomal protein L32 (RPL32), tubulin alpha-1 chain (TUBULIN), and elongation factor-1 alpha (ELF). Five programs, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, Delta Ct method, and RefFinder, were used to evaluate the expression stability of the 10 genes among various A. hygrophila body parts and with different nutrient types (starvation, diet types). The expression stability analysis showed that RPS32 and RPL13a were reliable reference genes for the study of gene transcription in different body parts; Actin and RPL13a were optimal reference genes for different nutrient types. The selections of reference genes were validated using a CarE gene (GeneBank No: KX353552). The results of this study provide useful bases for studies of gene expression in various aspects relating to A. hygrophila.					ma, rui/JGE-4890-2023															1536-2442				SEP 30	2021	21	5							9	10.1093/jisesa/ieab067	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jisesa/ieab067		SEP 2021						34591086					WOS:000704512600001

This studysystematically investigated the formation, evolution, and types ofPFRs and RS on sulfur-containing microplastics (S-MPs) under simulatedsunlight. Electron paramagnetic resonance detection and power saturationcurve analysis isolated three different PFRs on each photoaging poly-(phenylenesulfide) (PPS) and polysulfone (PSF). Combining the results of characterizationand density functional theory calculation, these observed PFRs onthe irradiated S-MPs were classified as oxygen-centered radicals withan adjacent S atom (namely, thio-oxygen radicals), oxygen-centeredand sulfur-centered radicals, where the thio-oxygen radicalson PPS were benzenethiol-like radicals, and oxygen-centered radicalsand sulfur-centered radicals on PSF that were identified as benzenesulfonic-likeradicals and phenyl sulfonyl-like radicals, respectively. Moreover,potential precursor molecule fragments of PFRs on the photoaging S-MPs,including p-toluenesulfinic acid and benzenesulfonicacid, were detected by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometryand liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Interestingly, reactivesulfur species (SO3 (center dot-)) was alsoobserved on irradiated S-MPs in addition to reactive oxygen species,which was mainly derived from the reaction of (center dot)OHand sulfonyl radicals. These results have implications for assessingthe potential risks of atmospheric S-MPs. Our study explored and confirmed thegeneration of the thio-oxygenand sulfur-centered persistent free radicals, as well as SO3 (center dot-) on S-MPs under light irradiation.

PSDs are significantly influenced by topographic, rainfall, and associate runoff characteristics, such as rainfall intensity (I), rainfall kinetic energy (KE), slope gradient (S), runoff velocity (v), and stream power (Omega), while their effects have not been fully understood so far. To fill this research gap, in this study, simulated rainfall experiments were conducted to investigate the characteristics of effective and ultimate PSDs of sediments, as well as their responses to related parameters, under five levels of I and S. The results showed that (1) for effective PSDs, there was a significant enrichment of clay-sized and silt-sized fractions (P-<2 mu m and P2-50 mu m) in sediment (percentage range: 12.11-20.64% and 57.09-65.94%), whereas there was a depletion of sand-sized fractions (P50-250 mu m and P250-2000 mu m). The ultimate PSDs of sediment were, however, similar to the soil matrix under experimental conditions. (2) With an increase in I and S, P-<2 mu m and P2-50 mu m decreased exponentially or logarithmically, and P50-250 mu m and P->250 mu m increased correspondingly. The contribution rates (PCs) of the effect of I on clay-, silt-, fine-sand-, and coarse-sand-sized fractions in sediment were 23.44, 35.45, 29.09, and 56.82%, respectively, whereas the PCs of that of S were 56.54, 24.42, 59.89, and 31.47%, respectively, indicating that S plays a more pivotal role in influencing P-<2 mu m and P50-250 mu m, whereas P2-50 mu m and P->250 mu m were more sensitive to I than to S. (3) The aggregation ratio (AR) for the fractions of different sizes indicated that clay-sized particles tend to be transported as aggregates, while silt-sized particles tend to be transported as primary particles. A higher I or steeper S leads to a larger proportion of particles being transported as aggregates. (4) KE, Omega, and unit stream power (U) were the most correlated parameters influencing effective PSDs. Equations were finally established using KE, Omega, and U to predict the effective PSDs of sediment by sheet erosion. This study can further the understanding of the sheet erosion process and provide a scientific basis for the establishment of a sheet erosion model.																			1998-9563	2224-7955				MAR	2022	53	3					483	503		10.2166/nh.2022.133	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2022.133		MAR 2022											WOS:000768591000001

Pest scenario of <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i> (Hub.) on pigeonpea during future climate change periods under RCP based projections in India	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Gram pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera (Hub.) is the major insect pest of pigeonpea and prediction of number of generations (no. of gen.) and generation time (gen. time) using growing degree days (GDD) approach during three future climate change periods viz., Near (NP), Distant (DP) and Far Distant (FDP) periods at eleven major pigeonpea growing locations of India was attempted. Multi-model ensemble of Maximum (Tmax) and Minimum (Tmin) temperature data of four Representative Concentration Pathways viz., RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 of Coupled Model Inter comparison Project 5 (CMIP5) models was adopted here. The increase in projected Tmax and Tmin are significant during 3 climate change periods (CCPs) viz., the NP, DP and FDP over base line (BL) period under four RCP scenarios at all locations and would be higher (4.7-5.1 degrees C) in RCP 8.5 and in FDP. More number of annual (10-17) and seasonal (5-8) gens. are expected to occur with greater percent increase in FDP (8 to 38%) over base line followed by DP (7 to 22%) and NP (5to 10%) periods with shortened annual gen. time (4 to 27%) across 4 RCPs. The reduction of crop duration was substantial in short, medium and long duration pigeonpeas at all locations across 4 RCPs and 3 CCPs. The seasonal no.of gen. is expected to increase (5 to 35%) with shortened gen. time (4 to 26%) even with reduced crop duration across DP and FDP climate periods of 6.0 and 8.5 RCPs in LD pigeonpea. More no. of gen. of H. armigera with reduced gen. time are expected to occur at Ludhiana, Coimbatore, Mohanpur, Warangal and Akola locations over BL period in 4 RCPs when normal duration of pigeonpeas is considered. Geographical location (66 to 72%), climate period (11 to 19%), RCPs (5-7%) and their interaction (0.04-1%) is vital and together explained more than 90% of the total variation in future pest scenario. The findings indicate that the incidence of H. armigera would be higher on pigeonpea during ensuing CCPs in India under global warming context.

Ethiopia has tremendous livestock resources, but its productivity is hindered by various animal health challenges in which ticks are the top priority, with a limited response to acaricidal treatments. Hence, we designed an acaricidal efficacy trial for the top commercially available Chemicals (amitraz and diazinon) to examine their efficacy against the widely distributed tick species (Amblyoma variegatum). Ticks were collected from animals admitted to veterinary clinics with no history of treatment with acaricides. Adult Immersion Technique (AIT) was employed to detect acaricidal resistance, and the mean percent control and antiparasitic efficacy were used to estimate tick susceptibility with a completely randomized laboratory-based trial (CRT). The mean weights of eggs laid by ticks subjected to amitraz and diazinon indicated that amitraz had a better egg-laying-inhibition effect than diazinon. The mean control percentages of amitraz and diazinon were 92.8 & PLUSMN; 5.6% and 69.7 & PLUSMN; 3.1%, respectively, with a highly significant difference (P-value = 0.00). The antiparasitic efficacy of the two drugs was 57.5 & PLUSMN; 0.96 and 37.5% & PLUSMN; 0.96 for amitraz and diazinon, respectively, which revealed that amitraz was statistically better than diazinon in killing adult ticks (P-value =0.026). In general, ticks treated with diazinon showed evidence of resistance development, and amitraz is relatively the most effective acaricide; we recommend its use in the study area and other locations with similar settings.					tibebu, abebe/IXN-0165-2023	tibebu, abebe/0000-0002-0741-1422													2405-9390					JUL	2023	42								100885	10.1016/j.vprsr.2023.100885	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vprsr.2023.100885		MAY 2023						37321790					WOS:001053081600001

AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Plastic mulching increases crop yield and water use efficiency (WUE). However, its sustainability in regard to crop productivity and inter-annual soil water balance is widely doubted. This study comprises a long-term field experiment (2010-2019), with spring maize and wheat treated as materials, and two treatments of (1) whole field plastic mulching (PM), and (2) without mulching (CK). The results showed that the soil water storage in the sowing stage decreased significantly in the 100-300 cm profile after 10 years of maize planting in both PM and CK, but there was no significant difference between PM and CK. For wheat, PM on average increased soil water storage by 30.1 mm in the 0-300 cm profile, but CK decreased it by 28.7 mm in the sowing stage in 2019. These results indicated that soil water depletion was caused by maize water uptake not PM. The PM significantly (P < 0.05) increased grain yield of maize and wheat by averages of 276.7 and 82.1 % compared with CK, respectively. Especially in drought years, the grain yield of maize increased by 400.0 and 622.2 % (2011 and 2016, respectively) and of wheat by 405.1 and 231.5 % (2011 and 2017, respectively). The relative variation coefficient of yield and WUE of PM decreased by 101.9 and 207.9 % in maize, respectively, and correspondingly by 48.3 and 47.2 % in wheat compared with CK. Our findings were that (i) soil water depletion depended on crop water uptake characteristics, and the conflict between soil water supply and crop demand was relieved by PM; (ii) PM stably increased crop productivity and maintained the inter-annual water balance; and (iii) PM should be explored widely in semiarid areas, and the plastic waste problem addressed, to ensure future food security.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				NOV 1	2020	241								106380	10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106380	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106380													WOS:000569704000012

In this study, we characterized the roots mycobiome of wild and cultivated pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br., synonym: Cenchrus americanus (L.) Morrone] in three agro-ecological areas of Senegal following a rainfall gradient. We hypothesized that wild pearl millet could serve as a reservoir of endophytes for cultivated pearl millet. We therefore analyzed the soil factors influencing fungal community structure and whether cultivated and wild millet shared the same fungal communities. The fungal communities associated with pearl millet were significantly structured according to sites and plant type (wild vs cultivated). Besides, soil pH and phosphorus were the main factors influencing the fungal community structure. We observed a higher fungal diversity in cultivated compared to wild pearl millet. Interestingly, we detected higher relative abundance of putative pathotrophs, especially plant pathogen, in cultivated than in wild millet in semi-arid and semi-humid zones, and higher relative abundance of saprotrophs in wild millet in arid and semi-humid zones. A network analysis based on taxa co-occurrence patterns in the core mycobiome revealed that cultivated millet and wild relatives had dissimilar groups of hub taxa. The identification of the core mycobiome and hub taxa of cultivated and wild pearl millet could be an important step in developing microbiome engineering approaches for more sustainable management practices in pearl millet agroecosystems.

To decrease the damage caused by continuous cropping, ten treatments of cabbage-maize-cabbage (CMC), kidney bean-maize-cabbage (BMC), cabbage-cabbage-cabbage (CCC), cabbage-maize-kidney bean (CMB), kidney bean-maize-kidney bean (BMB), kidney bean-kidney bean-kidney bean (BBB), cabbage-cabbage-maize (CCM), cabbage-kidney bean-maize (CBM), kidney bean-kidney bean-maize (BBM) and kidney bean-cabbage-maize (BCM) rotation combinations were set up. The changes in soil nutrients, fungal community structure, composition and diversity in topsoil under the ten crop rotation combinations were analyzed using Illumina NovaSeq high-throughput sequencing technology and chemical technology. Fungal species were abundant in the ten treatments. The OTUs (operational taxonomic units) showed no significant differences. The richness index values of each treatment had significant differences. The diversity index value of the CCC treatment was significantly lower than those of the other treatments. The dominant soil fungal phylum was Ascomycota, and the subordinate soil fungal phylum was Basidiomycota. No significant differences were observed in Ascomycota between the treatments. Basidiomycota in the BBM treatment was significantly higher than that in the CCM treatment. Kickxellomycota was not found in the CCM and CCC treatments. The BBM treatment had no Entorrhizomycota. The dominant soil fungal class belonged to Ascomycota. The common distinction between continuous cropping and crop rotation was Diaporthales, which might be the main fungal order causing continuous cropping disorders. As the best choice, the BBM treatment could prevent soil-borne fungal diseases and provide the basis for the rational crop rotation of cabbage, kidney bean, and maize.						wang, tianle/0000-0002-1619-1724														2073-4395				JUL	2023	13	7							1883	10.3390/agronomy13071883	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13071883													WOS:001034774100001

These initiatives aim to enhance ecosystem services, generate new income for the population, and safeguard biodiversity.In practice, however, reforestation has often led to a depletion of resources for communities due to enclosure policies. This paper explores various land management models for reforestation within a pastoral context through provisioning ecosystem services (PES) modeling.This study quantifies the economic potential of PES offered by reforestation programs in Senegal. It employs a quantitative methodology to assess the profitability of these operations from the perspective of pastoral economies. The analysis reveals that the PES benefits of reforestation can significantly enhance the economic potential of sylvo-pastoral productions if resource access is negotiated collaboratively between pastoralists and forestry extension services during reforestation activities and after. From an investment perspective, the economic viability of reforestation operations in drylands is questionable. The findings suggest that when evaluated solely in terms of PES profitability, these programs may not be financially sustainable. The sustainability of these investments would require taking into account supporting and regulating ecosystem services.																				2296-665X				OCT 25	2023	11								1073124	10.3389/fenvs.2023.1073124	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1073124													WOS:001098934300001

High-resolution dissection of photosystem II electron transport reveals differential response to water deficit and heat stress in isolation and combination in pearl millet [<i>Pennisetum glaucum</i> (L.) R. Br.]	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Heat and Water Deficit Stress (WDS) tend to impede and restrict the efficiency of photosynthesis, chlorophyll fluorescence, and maximum photochemical quantum yield in plants based on their characteristic ability to interfere with the electron transport system in photosystem II. Dissection of the electron transport pathway in Photosystem II (PSII) under water deficit and Heat Stress (HS) can be insightful in gaining knowledge on the various attributes of the photosynthetic performance of a plant. We attempt a high-resolution dissection of electron transport in PSII with studies on chlorophyll a fast fluorescence kinetics and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) as a response to and recovery from these stresses in pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.] in isolation and combination. In this study, we bring out the mechanisms by which both heat and water stress, in isolation and in combination, affect the photosynthetic electron transport in Photosystem II. Our results indicate that oxygen evolution complex (OEC) damage is the primary effect of heat stress and is not seen with the same intensity in the water-stressed plants. Low exciton absorption flux in heat stress and combined stress was seen due to OEC damage, and this caused an electron transport traffic jam in the donor side of PS II. Both the specific energy flux model and the phenomenological flux model developed from the derived values in our study show that water deficit stress in combination with heat stress has a much stronger effect than the stresses in isolation on the overall electron transport pathway of the PS II in pearl millet plants.

Cooperative Effect of Salicylic Acid and Boron on the Productivity of Pearl Millet Crop under the Degraded Saline Soils Conditions	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												DROUGHT and salinity are the most limiting factors for crop production in arid and semiarid areas. Moreover, pearl millet cultivation may be an excellent selection in arid and saline lands. Therefore, two field experiments were conducted at the Desert Research Center, Agriculture Experimental Station at Ras Sudr, South Sinai Governorate, Egypt during 2018 and 2019 seasons, to study the effect of seed priming (as seed soaking) using five salicylic acids levels (tap water as a control, 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg/L SA) and fertilizing soil application by five boron rates (without boron, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 kg boron/fed, as boric acid) on pearl millet yields. The results showed that plant height (cm), panicle length (cm), panicles number/m(2), grain weight/panicle (g), seed index (g) and grain protein content percentage as well as biological, grain and protein yields (kg/fed) were significantly increased by salicylic acid (SA) levels in both seasons. Soaking the grains of pearl millet in 200 mg/L SA treatment was the best practice in both seasons as compared to the other treatments. Regarding the effect of boron (B) treatments, all the abovementioned characters were significantly affected by B treatments in the two studied seasons. Adding 3 kg B/fed gave the highest values of all the studied attributes in both seasons. It is clear that from the obtained results pearl millet grain primed in 200 mg/L SA along with B at a rate of 3 kg/fed could be recommended for enhancing pearl millet yields under saline soil conditions.

J	Mohammadi, R				Mohammadi, Reza			The use of a combination scoring index to improve durum productivity under drought stress	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												Breeding for drought tolerance using novel genetic resources possessing relevant agronomic and adaptive traits is a key to enhance productivity and food security in wheat growing areas. Herein, the main objectives were (i) to use a combination scoring index (multiple scoring index, (MSI)) for selection of durum wheat genotypes under different drought stress intensities (SIs) (ii) to examine repeatability of the scoring index through bootstrap re-sample method, and (iii) to study the relationship of MSI with some drought-adaptive traits. Sixteen durum wheat genotypes were grown under rainfed and irrigated conditions during three cropping seasons (2012-2015), resulting in different drought SIs, that is, mild (SI < 0.3), moderate (0.3 < SI < 0.6), and severe (SI > 0.6). The average grain yields among test environments varied between 708 and 3631 kg ha(-1). The validation of the methodology of scoring index was confirmed by the correlation coefficients between score indices and their original values across different drought SIs. According to MSI, the genotypes G16, G1, and G3 had the best combination of high productivity and high resilience to mild, moderate, and severe drought stress conditions, respectively. These results indicated that the ranking of genotypes varied among different drought SIs, which support the high potential of durum wheat for adaptation to different drought stress conditions. Based on the bootstrap samples, non-repeatable correlations were observed between the estimates of MSI from different levels of stress. The significant correlation between MSI with grain yield and 1000-kernel weight (TKW) under severe drought condition provides evidence that MSI ultimately be considered as a tool for effective selection of drought-tolerant genotypes. The MSI selected genotypes based on high productivity and resilience, to each level of drought SI, and favorable adaptive traits useful for breeding.

Maize is an important crop grown around the world for food, feed and raw material for various industries. The aim of the present study was to evaluate two microbial consortia viz., microbial consortia 1 (Pseudomonas putida P7 + Paenibacillus favisporus B30) and microbial consortia 2 (Pseudomonas putida P45 + Bacillus amyloliquefaciens B17) under field conditions for their suitability in improving maize yield under rainfed situations at Ballowal Saunkhri (Punjab) having sub-humid (Hot Dry) climatic conditions. Pooled analysis of three years field experiments data showed that, seed + soil application of microbial consortia 1 and 2 led to enhancement in grain yield of kharif maize by 27.78 and 23.21% respectively over uninoculated control. Likewise, significant increase in Benefit:Cost ratio as well as straw yield was also observed. The present investigation suggests that, microbial consortia would help in significantly improving the yield and economics of maize grown on inceptisols under rainfed conditions.

The existence of broad genetic diversity in V. vinifera is key in adapting viticulture to climate change; however, a lack of understanding on the variability in berry metabolic response to climate change remains a major challenge to build ad-hoc strategies for quality fruit production. In the present study, we examined the impact of a consistent temperature difference between two vineyards on polyphenol metabolism in the berries of 20 red V. vinifera cultivars across three consecutive seasons (2017-2019). The results emphasize a varietal specific response in the content of several phenylpropanoid metabolites; the interaction factor between the variety and the vineyard location was also found significant. Higher seasonal temperatures were coupled with lower flavonol and anthocyanin contents, but such reductions were not related with the level of expression of phenylpropanoid related genes. Hierarchical clustering analyses of the metabolic data revealed varieties with a location specific response, exceptional among them was Tempranillo, suggesting a greater susceptibility to temperature of this cultivar. In conclusion, our results indicate that the extensive genetic capacity of V. vinifera bears a significant potential to withstand temperature increase associated with climate change.																			1664-462X					OCT 19	2023	14								1239852	10.3389/fpls.2023.1239852	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2023.1239852								37929177					WOS:001095537100001

However, the average productivity of the crop has stagnated at around 2,000 kg ha(-1) in India. Recently released nutrient responsive high yielding varieties are reported to respond better to application of fertilizers/manures. Further, substitution of chemical fertilizers with organic manures to maintain sustainable yields and improve soil health is gaining attention in recent years. Therefore, identifying the appropriate rate and source of nutrition is important to enhance the productivity of finger millet while improving the soil health. A field experiment was conducted during two rainy seasons (July-November, 2018 and 2019) to study the response of finger millet varieties to chemical fertilizers and farmyard manure (FYM) on growth, yields, N use efficiency, N uptake and on soil properties. Two varieties MR-1 and MR-6 were tested with four nutrient management practices viz., unamended control, 100% recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF; 40-20-20 kg NPK ha(-1)), 50% RDF + 50% recommended dose of nitrogen (RDN) as FYM and 100% RDN as FYM. Among the varieties, MR-6 outperformed MR-1 in terms of growth, yield, N use efficiency and N uptake. The yield enhancement was up to 22.6% in MR-6 compared to MR-1 across the nutrient management practices. Substituting FYM completely or half of the fertilizer dose increased the growth and yield of finger millet compared to application of chemical fertilizers alone. Similarly, the average biomass yield, ears m(-2), grain yield, total N uptake and N use efficiency in response to nutrient management practices followed the order of 100% RDN as FYM > 50% RDF + 50% RDN as FYM > 100% RDF. The soil organic carbon, available N, P, K, and S improved by 25.0, 12.9, 5.7, 6.1, and 22.6%, respectively in the plots under higher rate of FYM application (8 Mg ha(-1)) compared to plots under chemical fertilizers alone. We conclude that substituting chemical fertilizers either completely or by up to 50% with organic manures supplies adequate amounts of nutrients, improves the yield of finger millet, economic returns, and soil properties.																			2296-861X					OCT 12	2023	10								1095449	10.3389/fnut.2023.1095449	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2023.1095449								37899837					WOS:001089744600001

A split-split plot design was used with varieties assigned to the main plot, micronutrient to the sub plots and seeding rates to the sub-sub plots. Varieties were sown at seeding rate of 100, 125, 150 and 175 kg ha(-1) and treated with ZnSO4 and FeSO4, applied foliarly at 25 kg ha(-1) during anthesis stage. Significant differences among seeding rates, varieties and micro nutrients and some of their interactions were observed. Higher seeding rate increased grain and biomass yields by 23.5% and 21.5%, respectively. Increasing seed rate from 100 to 175 kg ha(-1) has reduced protein, gluten and Zeleny contents by 8.7%, 10.8% and 9.1%, respectively. FeSO4 x seeding rate interaction improved quality traits better than ZnSO4 interacted with seeding rate. Application of ZnSO4 and FeSO4 has increased Zn and Fe concentrations in the harvested grain. Agronomic biofortification could be an approach to overcome health problem related to Zn and Fe deficiency if used in combination with crop varieties with known genetic response to applied micro fertilizers.

Three planting densities (L: 52,500, M: 75,000, and H: 97,500 plants ha(-1)) and four supplementary irrigation modes (NI: no irrigation; IV: 375 m(3) ha(-1) during the 11-leaf stage; IS: 375 m(3) ha(-1) in the silking stage; and IVS: 375 m(3) ha(-1) during both stages) were tested. The irrigation treatments significantly increased the leaf relative water content, but the high planting density significantly decreased the relative water content during the silking and filling stages. After supplementary irrigation during the 11-leaf stage, IV and IVS significantly increased the photosynthetic capacity, but decreased the leaf water use efficiency. IS and IVS significantly increased the photosynthetic capacity after supplementary irrigation in the silking stage over two years. During the filling stage, IV, IS, and IVS increased the two-year average net photosynthetic rate by 17.0%, 27.2%, and 30.3%, respectively. The intercellular CO2 concentration increased as the density increased, whereas the stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, net photosynthetic rate, and leaf water use efficiency decreased, and the high planting density significantly reduced the leaf photosynthetic capacity. The highest grain yield was obtained using the IVS treatment under the medium planting density, but it did not differ significantly from that with the IS treatment. Furthermore, the IVS treatment used two times more water than the IS treatment. Thus, the medium planting density combined with supplementary irrigation during the silking stage was identified as a suitable water-saving planting model to improve the photosynthetic capacity and grain yield, and to cope with drought and water shortages in semiarid regions.					liu, dong/GRJ-9115-2022; Liu, DY/JPL-4171-2023														2167-8359					OCT 6	2020	8								e9959	10.7717/peerj.9959	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.9959								33083115					WOS:000575389700010
J	Billi, P; Spalevic, V				Billi, Paolo; Spalevic, Velibor			Suspended sediment yield in Italian rivers	CATENA												The knowledge about river sediment yield in Italy is rather scarce and mainly based on small reservoir sedimentation data. This study used the suspended sediment yield field data measured by the national and regional hydrological services. The data of nine rivers and 11 selected flow gauges were used to investigate the control of basic parameters such as catchment area, annual precipitation and a characteristic discharge on sediment yield. The average sediment yield of Italy is close to the world mean but the relationship between catchment area and sediment yield is not significant, though a general decreasing trend with increasing catchment area can be distinguished. The variation of sediment yield with annual precipitation is poorly significant, although a general increasing trend with increasing catchment area can be observed. Sediment yield varies widely. The largest range of variability occurs for annual precipitation between 700 and 800 mm. The data indicate an average suspended sediment yield of 220 t km(-2)yr(-1) and an upper limit of 3000 t km(-2)yr(-1) which is observed in all the study rivers, no matter the catchment size which ranges from 580 to 70091 km(2). Such a high value seems to be the maximum sediment yield possible in Italy given the local climatic, tectonic and land use characteristics. The discharge exceeded 10 days a year (2.7% of time) was found to exert a substantial control on sediment yield. Groups of rivers with similar catchment area show significant correlations and almost parallel trendlines. The occurrence of data gaps and multiple years interruptions allowed the investigation on the decadal variation of sediment yield of only very few rivers. The reduction of sediment yield is remarkable. The decrease in annual precipitation and the unprecedented expansion of forests are considered as the main factors causing such marked decrease of sediment yield in Italy.

J	Teshome, ZT				Teshome, Zawde Tadesse			Effects of banana peel compost rates on Swiss chard growth performance and yield in Shirka district, Oromia, Ethiopia	HELIYON												Increasing Population growth and expansion of urbanization lead to the emission of solid waste, including household waste, which causes environmental pollution. However, these wastes can be converted into forms used for organic farming. Therefore, the study was conducted to examine the effect of banana peel compost rates on the growth performance and yield of Swiss chard. The experiment took place in the Kulumsa Agricultural Research Center Greenhouse, with an area of 1.42m(2) and pot area of 628cm(2). The randomization of both treatments and replication was done by using Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD). Field and laboratory data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) by using general linear model (GLM) of the SAS statistical package version 9.0 to determine the existence of any statistical difference among the treatments. Soil and 10, 20, and30g rates of banana peel compost were characterized by a variety of plant nutrients. These include nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, micronutrients (iron, manganese, zinc, and molybdenum), power of hydrogen, organic carbon, and cat ion exchange capacity, carbon to nitrogen ratio, moisture content, and electrical conductivity. Each of plant nutrients were tested in the soil and banana peel compost rates(10, 20 and 30g), with nitrogen of 0.46, 1.54,1.93 and 2.58%; phosphorus of 1.51, 5.77, 5.8, and 5.91mg/kg, potassium of 11.82,41.28, 41.98, and 42.34mg/kg; calcium of 5.55, 25.04, 27.08, and 29.02mg/kg, magnesium of 6.2, 20.48, 22.88, and 23.93mg/kg; and sulfur of 5.79, 13.00, 14.38 and 16.45mg/kg/, respectively. Similarly, iron of 9.65, 15.72, 17.85, and 18.16mg/kg; manganese of 1.41, 4.23,6.38, and 8.91mg/kg; zinc of 1.17, 2.95, 4.25, and 5.60mg/kg; molybdenum of 0.53, 1.21,3.28, and 5.30mg/kg were tested, respectively. In addition to these, power of hydrogen was 6.34, 6.10, 6.22, and 7.30; organic carbon was 1.31, 15.0, 23.47, and 25.50%; carbon to nitrogen ratio was 2.85, 9.81, 12.16, and 9.88; cat ion exchange capacity was 21.08, 24.21, 34.58, and 36.94 (cmol (thorn) /kg; moister content was 5.75,7.24, 8.81, and 9.85%; and electrical conductivity was 0.11, 2.06, 3.23, and 4.09(ds/cm), respectively, for soil and 10, 20, and 30g rates of banana peel compost. The height of the plants, the number of leaves, the leaves area, the leaves area index (LAI), the length of the leaf and the width of the leaves were all parameters of Swiss chard growth performance based. Each of the Swiss Chard growth parameters was measured in 10g, 20g, and 30g treatments, with average plants height of 22.00, 24.67 and 26.33 cm, average leaves number of 9.00, 12.00 and 8.00, average leaves area of 111.33 and 134.30cm(2) and average leaves width of 8.33, 10.80, and 12.77cm, respectively. Similarly, the mean leaves area index (LAI) was 0.10, 0.30, and 0.5; leaves length was 12.80, 13.00, and 14.67cm, respectively, for 10g, 20g, and 30g treatments. In addition to the Swiss chard growth parameters, the Swiss chard yield parameters have also been measured. Fresh and dry weights were the Swiss chard yield parameters. For each treatment (10g, 20g and 30g), fresh weights 2.44, 2.03 and 3.41g, and dry weights 0.11, 0.08 and 0.14g were recorded, respectively. In conclusion, all the rates of banana peel compost were enhanced and improved Swiss chard growth performance and yield, better than the no compost control.

Applicability of laser diffraction method for soil particle size distribution analysis of five soil orders in the water erosion region of China	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Soil particle size distribution (PSD) is a critical parameter for soil loss estimation in many water erosion models. The laser diffraction method (LDM) has been increasingly applied for soil PSD determination in recent decades, and its applicability and reliability need systematical examinations. The objective was to evaluate the performance of LDM for PSD determination of five soil orders in the water erosion region of China relative to the traditional sieve-pipette method (SPM).A total of 465 soil samples were collected in the five water erosion subregions of China, which correspond to five soil orders of Mollisols, Alfisols, Entisols, Inceptisols, and Oxisols. All the samples were analyzed with LDM for the four size fractions widely employed in water erosion models (i.e., 100 to 2,000, 53 to 100, 2 to 53, and <2 mu m), and the corresponding results were compared to those obtained by SPM. The comparisons show varying results between LDM and SPM for the sand content, or the two sand-sized fractions of 100 to 2,000 and 53 to 100 mu m. LDM consistently overestimated the silt content and underestimated the clay fraction, yet the magnitude of either the overestimation or underestimation varied among soil orders. The PSD discrepancies shifted the textural classes of 44.8% to 96.2% of the soil samples and, on average, increased the soil erodibility K factor by 0.010 to 0.034 t MJ(-1) h mm(-1) for different soil orders.The optimal clay/silt and silt/sand boundaries of LDM were derived to match the size fractions measured by SPM. Nevertheless, except for the silt/sand boundary of 58.2 mu m for one soil order, each of the other threshold boundaries held a Lin's concordance correlation coefficient less than 0.8, suggesting moderate or poor agreement between LDM and SPM. Linear regression models were also established to convert the four size fractions between the two methods for all the samples as well as for each soil order.

J	Reddy, AA; Roy, NS; Pradeep, D				Reddy, A. Amarender; Roy, Namrata Singha; Pradeep, Divya			Has India's Employment Guarantee Program Achieved Intended Targets?	SAGE OPEN												This paper explores the performance of the world's largest employment guarantee program, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Schemes in India, both nationally and through a sub-national-level comparison based on key performance indicators viz. (i) financial indicators, (ii) physical performance indicators, and (iii) inclusiveness indicators. The paper is based on administrative data taken from the Ministry of Rural Development from 2006 to 2019. Despite sharp increases in fund allocation, total expenditures, and utilization rates, there was deceleration in majority of physical performance indicators after 2016, including total person-days employment and person-days of employment per household, with wide variation in sub-national level implementation capabilities. The finding also rejects the falsity of saturation of MGNREGA work in the rural areas, which is reflected in a strong positive correlation between fund allocation and employment generation. Its broader objective of social safety net for vulnerable people in rural areas shows an achievement, although with some gaps in implementation.

The key mechanisms were investigated via a 3-year consecutive FMRF and S interactive experiments [CP (conventional planting, Control), CPS, FMRF, FMRFS] from 2014 to 2016. In comparison with CP, FMRFS increased the temperature by 1.8 degrees C to 4.8 degrees C and the soil water content of 0-200 cm soil profile (W-200) by 98.0 mm to 106.7 mm from the seedling to tasseling stage, and decreased the temperature by 1.1 degrees C to 3.7 degrees C from flowering to maturity. The concentrations of soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total and available nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (TN, TP, TK and AN, AP, AK) were also remarkable increased by 5.9% to 55.1% (P < 0.05) for FMRFS, respectively. FMRFS considerably mitigated the effects of the frequent water and heat stress and fertility deficit and led to a higher maize yield (27.0% to 40.0%), improved WUE (1.4-folds to 2.0-folds). The W-200, SOC, TN, TP, AN and AP significant contribute to maize yield. Therefore, FMRFS not only enhanced the soil fertility but also maintained soil water balance, thus causing a signi?cant increase in maize yield and WUE.																			0365-0340	1476-3567				NOV 10	2022	68	13					1796	1809		10.1080/03650340.2021.1928647	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2021.1928647		MAY 2021											WOS:000654789800001

Design policies for increasing smallholder productivity remains a safe way to establish sustainable food systems and boost local economies. However, efforts are still needed in order to achieve accurate and timely monitoring in smallholder farming systems. With the advent of modern Earth Observation programmes such as the Sentinel satellites, which provide quasi-synchronous and high-resolution multi-source information over any area of the continental surfaces, new opportunities are opened up to accurately map crop yields in smallholder farming systems. This study intends to estimate and forecast millet yields in central Senegal, making the use of multi-source (synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) and optical) image time series and state-of-the-art machine learning models. A Random Forest (RF) model explained up to 50% of the millet yield variability, while deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) showed promise results but performed lower. We also found that the concatenation of SAR polarizations and vegetation indices improved our crop yield modelling, but such improvement was tightly related to the modelling approach, namely RF and CNN. Using RF to forecast millet yields, we achieved stable and satisfactory accuracy 2 weeks before the harvest period.

To revert this inorganic fertilizer has been introduced in these countries to improve land productivity. However, how impactful is the application of this inorganic fertilizer towards improving sesame productivity dependents on socio-economic, crop types, institutional, and environmental factors. Thus, this study aims at analyzing the impacts of inorganic fertilizer adoption on sesame productivity in the Humera district. A household survey was administered to collect micro-level evidence from randomly selected 393 households using face-to-face interviews. Endogenous switching regression and propensity score matching models were employed to estimate the impact of inorganic fertilizer adoption on sesame productivity. Adoption of inorganic fertilizer is significantly influenced by years of farming experience, total farm size, educational status, household size, land ownership, an area under sesame cultivation, the practice of land fallow as soil management methods, and access to the off-farm activity. Adoption of inorganic fertilizer improved the probability of Sesame productivity by 15% for adopters and 26.1% for non-adopters had households decided to adopt.

This paper contributes to our understanding of agricultural technology adoption by showing that a focus on yield gains may, in some contexts, be misguided. We study a technology in Ethiopia that has no impact on yields, but that has nonetheless been widely adopted. Using three waves of panel data, we estimate a correlated random coefficient model and calculate the returns to improved chickpea in terms of yields, costs, and profits. We find that farmers' comparative advantage does not play a significant role in their adoption decisions and hypothesize that this is due to the overall high economic returns to adoption, despite the limited yield impacts of the technology. Our results suggest economic measures of returns may be more relevant than increases in yields in explaining technology adoption decisions.

"Ecological Civilization" is a term that demonstrates the strategy to achieve the win-win goal of economic development and eco-environment protection. "Water Ecological Civilization" is a vital part of "Ecological Civilization". This paper introduced a composite index to characterize the Urban Water Ecological Civilization (UWEC) and established an evaluation index system for UWEC based on a multicriteria analytical framework. The evaluation system contains 20 indicators selected from six criterion layers: water resources utilization (A, evaluating the efficiency of industrial, agricultural, domestic and public water use), water security assurance (B, evaluating the flood control, drainage and drinking water safety), water environmental protection (C, evaluating the water environment quality and water pollution prevention), water ecological restoration (D, evaluating the health of regional water ecosystem), water culture system (E, evaluating the inheritance of water culture and the popularization of UWEC awareness) and water management institution (F, evaluating the implementation of management systems). In our research, three major urban agglomerations (UAs) in Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) were chosen to be the study area. The results presented that the UWEC level of UAs gradually increased along the Yangtze River from west to east, showing obvious spatial differences. The main criteria restricting the UWEC level of UAs in the Yangtze River Delta were D and E, while E and F were the main restricting criteria for the UWEC level of UAs in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River and Cheng-Yu District. The indicator of "drainage compliance rate" got the lowest score among all indicators for three UAs. In addition, targeted measures for improving the UWEC level of UAs in YREB were proposed. Our study is supposed to provide a scientific reference to the improvement of UWEC level for UAs in YREB and trigger further research in the field of water ecological civilization.

Our findings indicate that, in the absence of men and presence of norms restricting women's movement out of rural life, women are becoming increasingly engaged in farm management. Women's aspirational narratives focused on commercialising farm activities, likely reflecting their changing agricultural opportunity space and new realities as farm managers. We highlight that only considering aspirations at the household level overlooks differing individual contributions, agency over various household income streams and individuals' changing roles throughout life. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for further aspirations research including explicit consideration of intrahousehold heterogeneity and how individual strategies and aspirations interrelate and are negotiated at the household level to build an overall livelihood strategy.

This study was carried out in rural kebeles in the Kebri Dahar district, and it focuses on livelihood diversification strategies and the factors that affect livelihood diversification. The collected types of data were from primary and secondary sources based on a qualitative and quantitative basis. Multistage sampling techniques were employed in selecting the representative households of 119 respondents. Furthermore, multinomial logistic regressions were used to analyze and achieve the objective. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 was used to analyze the collected data. The results revealed that 33.6%, 3.30%, 10.1%, and 52.9% of the respondents participated in the on-farm, off-farm, nonfarm, and combinations of livelihood activities, respectively. The descriptive statistics showed that 52.9% of the respondents diversified their livelihoods and 47.1% did not. The multinomial logistic regression shows that being male-headed as well as the increased age of HH head were found to be significant at a 1% significance level in three livelihood activities which positively and negatively influenced livelihood diversification. Livelihood diversification has a positive impact on security in the study area. Thus, it should be promoted not only by the government and nongovernmental organizations but also by individuals who are interested in livelihood diversification since it implies food security.

A direct field incubation test of straw with and without decomposer (T1 and T2) under FM using the litter bag method and a 3-year field experiment of five treatments including conventional planting (CP, as control), CP with straw incorporation (CPS), CP with straw incorporation plus decomposer (CPSD), FM with straw incorporation (FMS), and FM with straw incorporation plus decomposer (FMSD) were conducted in 2014-2016. The results showed that the initial straw N content, indigenous soil nitrogen content, and soil hydrothermal conditions were all remarkably affected by maize straw decomposition, and C and N release regardless of the decomposer. Applying the decomposer resulted in 80.3% decomposition of maize straw, leading to 81.3% of straw C and 83.3% of straw N release into the soil, which were 1.4, 1.1, and 1.06 times than that of CK, respectively. Meanwhile, the FMSD was significantly better in improving soil nutritional conditions, particularly for the tested parameters of soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen (TN), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK). Importantly, FMSD drove a strong synergistic effect of decomposer and the modified soil hydrothermal conditions in comparison with CP, which led to the significant increase in SOC, TN, TP, AN, AP, and AK by 4.4-8.7%, 5.2-7.5%, 3.0-6.8%, 11.1-12.6%, 3.6-60.5%, and 6.2-54.6%, respectively. Therefore, FMSD is the best model for more efficient and sustainable soil fertility management in semiarid areas in China.																			0718-9508	0718-9516				MAR	2020	20	1					125	138		10.1007/s42729-019-00106-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42729-019-00106-y		NOV 2019											WOS:000495028400002

Nineteen durum wheat genotypes differing in origin were evaluated for their grain yield and agro-physiological characteristics under rainfed conditions for two consecutive cropping seasons,2017-18 and 2018-19. The main effects due to year, genotype and their interactions were significant for most of the investigated traits. The genotype by trait biplots (known as GT biplot) indicated that the relationships among the studied traits were not consistent over the years but they facilitated visual genotype comparison and selection at each year. The 1000-kernel weight (TKW) and normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) consistently associated with grain yield suggesting the importance of these traits to be used as selection criteria for enhancing grain yield under rainfed conditions. Based on the cluster heat map, the genotypes classified into five groups with different levels of combined grain yield and physiological and agronomic attributes. The traits heading date, NDVI, Fv/Fm, TKW and SPAD-reading had contributed to grain yield. The study also identified potential lines with high yield and drought tolerance for subsequent varietal development for water limited areas.

To overcome the disease's consequences, the OIE and FAO are collaborating efforts to eradicate the disease once and for all. We developed a predictive model that delineates suitable territories for the virus globally in support of this eradication programme. To achieve this, we used an ecological niche modelling with an ensemble algorithm. AUC-ROC curve, true skill statistics (TSS) and Kappa values were used to evaluate the model's performance. A TSS value greater than 0.7 was used to pool outputs of the nine model. The ensemble model has better performance than individual models by every evaluation metrics (Kappa = 0.82, TSS = 0.88 and ROC = 0.99). Annual minimum temperature (24.92%), annual maximum temperature (21.37%), goat density (18.03%) and solar radiation (14.04%) have the highest overall contribution in the ensemble model. The model indicates that India, Mongolia, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Nepal, Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Sudan, Angola, Nigeria, DRC, Ghana, Sierra Leon, Southern Spain, France, Albania, Montenegro, Macedonia, Italy, Armenia and Azerbaijan are highly suitable for PPRv. In 2040, suitable territories for PPRv will diminish, indicating the odds are with us in eradicating disease by 2030. We believe that this model can be used as an epidemiological tool to facilitate the global eradication programme of the disease set by the OIE and FAO.

Ashok; Prandavada, Anand; Anjaiah, Mukkera			Transpiration efficiency: insights from comparisons of C<sub>4</sub> cereal species	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												We have previously reported that there is a tight link between high transpiration efficiency (TE; shoot biomass per unit water transpired) and restriction of transpiration under high vapor pressure deficit (VPD). In this study, we examine other factors affecting TE among major C-4 cereals, namely species' differences, soil type, and source-sink relationships. We found that TE in maize (10 genotypes) was higher overall than in pearl millet (10 genotypes), and somewhat higher than in sorghum (16 genotypes). Overall, transpiration efficiency was higher in high-clay than in sandy soil under high VPD, but the effect was species-dependent with maize showing large variations in TE and yield across different soil types whilst pearl millet showed no variation in TE. This suggested that species fitness was specific to soil type. Removal of cobs drastically decreased TE in maize under high VPD, but removal of panicles did not have the same effect in pearl millet, suggesting that source-sink balance also drove variations in TE. We interpret the differences in TE between species as being accounted for by differences in the capacity to restrict transpiration under high VPD, with breeding history possibly having favored the source-sink balance in maize. This suggests that there is also scope to increase TE in pearl millet and sorghum through breeding. With regards to soil conditions, our results indicate that it appears to be critical to consider hydraulic characteristics and the root system together in order to better understand stomatal regulation and restriction of transpiration under high VPD. Finally, our results highlight the importance of sink strength in regulating transpiration/photosynthesis, and hence in influencing TE.

Potassium (K) critically contributes to the process of photosynthetic carbon assimilation and carbohydrate metabolism. We explored the effects of potassium fertilization on physiological mechanisms including carbohydrate metabolism in foxtail millet and its yield. Field experiments were performed using two foxtail millet (Setaria italica L.) cultivars: 1) Jingu 21 (low-K sensitive); and 2) Zhangza 10 (low-K tolerant). Effect of five different potassium fertilizer (K2O) rates (0, 60, 120, 180, and 240 kg center dot hm(-2)) were tested in two consecutive years, 2020 and 2021. We found that potassium application significantly increases the K content, dry matter accumulation and yield. Jingu 21 and Zhangza 10 had maximum yields at 180 kg center dot hm(-2) K application, which were 29.91% and 31.51% larger than without K application, respectively. Excessive K application (K-240) did not further improve their yields. The suitable K fertilizer application of Jingu 21 and Zhangza 10 are 195.25-204.27 and 173.95-175.87 kg center dot K2O center dot hm(-2), respectively. The net photosynthetic rate (P-n), ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) were positively correlated with the potassium content. Potassium application improved the availability of carbon sources for carbohydrate synthesis. Compared with the K-0 treatment, variations in the activities of sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) and sucrose synthase (SuSy) in potassium-treated Jingu 21 (K-60, K-120, K-180, and K-240) were 17.94%-89.93% and 22.48%-182.10%, respectively, which were greater than those of Zhangza 10 (11.34%-71.12% and 16.18%-109.13%, respectively) and indicate that Jingu 21 is more sensitive to potassium application. The sucrose contents in the Jingu 21 and Zhangza 10 grains were 0.97%-1.15% and 1.04%-1.23%, respectively. The starch contents were 28.99%-37.75% and 24.81%-34.62%, respectively. The sucrose: ratio of Jingu 21 was smaller than that of Zhangza 10, indicating that Jingu 21 utilized nutrients better than Zhangza 10. Stepwise regression and path analysis showed that leaf and grain SuSy activity, by coordinating the source-sink relationship, have the greatest direct effect on Jingu 21 yield, whereas leaf SuSy activity, by promoting the generation of photosynthates at the source leaf, plays a leading role in Zhangza 10 yield increase. In conclusion, optimized K application can increase foxtail millet grain yield by improving photosynthesis and promoting carbohydrate accumulation and distribution.																			1664-462X					NOV 30	2022	13								1044065	10.3389/fpls.2022.1044065	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.1044065								36531412					WOS:000898168800001

However, there is a lack of systematic understanding of hydrothermal coordination mechanisms in long-term field ex-periments, which is also critical for sustainable agricultural development. This experiment had four treatments: (1) plastic mulching (PM); (2) sand mulching (SM); (3) alternate plastic and sand mulching (PSM); and (4) without mulching (CK). The results showed that before sowing, the soil water storage in the 0-300 cm profile of the PM, SM, and PSM treatments increased by 20.4%, 13.9%, and 12.2% compared with CK, respectively. The water consumption was ranked in the order of PM > PSM > SM > CK in the filling stage; and the > 10 degrees C accumulated soil temperature in PM, SM, and PSM increased by 126.9 degrees C, 58.3 degrees C, and 77.3 degrees C in the seed-ling-jointing stage compared with CK, respectively. There was a significant positive correlation between maize growth rate and > 10 degrees C accumulated soil temperature in all treatments in the seedling-tasseling stage, and the response sensitivities of maize growth rate to > 10 degrees C accumulated soil temperature of PM, SM, and PSM were highest in seedling-jointing, jointing-tasseling, and filling stages, respectively. There was a significant positive correlation between maize growth rate and seasonal water consumption, and response sensitivity was ranked in the order of PM > PSM > SM > CK in the seedling-jointing, jointing-tasseling, and tasseling-filling stages and PM < PSM < SM < CK in the filling stage. The seasonal water consumption in the jointing-tasseling stage was most critical to yield formation, and mulching reduced this response sensitivity. After 10 years of cropping, the soil water storage in the 0-300 cm profile decreased by 230.8, 202.9, 243.8, and 228.2 mm in the PM, SM, PSM, and CK treatments, respectively. The mulching practices coordinated soil hydrothermal relationships, with yield and water use efficiency (WUE) ranked in the order of PM > PSM > SM > CK for annual precipitation of 323.1-418.3 mm, and significantly differing (P < 0.05). The yield and WUE of PM and PSM did not significantly differ for annual precipitation of 484.4-533.3 mm and were significantly higher than those for SM and CK. These indicated that PM should be preferentially adopted in areas with rainfall below 420 mm, and the PSM in areas with rainfall above 420 mm, resulting in higher yield and WUE and less plastic film pollution.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				APR 1	2022	263								107448	10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107448	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107448		JAN 2022											WOS:000793039800001

The study was conducted on 334 lactating cows selected from 70 smallholder dairy farms. California mastitis test (CMT) and bacteriological culture methods were used as diagnostic tools. From 334 cows examined, 114 (34.1%) and from 1054 quarters examined, 238 (17.8%) were positive for subclinical mastitis using CMT test. Adult and old cows were 3.681 (95% CI=1.541, 8.788) and 15.044 (95% CI=3.051, 74.174) times more likely to have a chance of contracting mastitis than young cows respectively. Cow's having 4-7 calving were 88.9% (OR=0.111, 95% CI=0.29, 0.423) less likely to have a chance of contracting mastitis than cows having 3 calving by keeping another factors constant. Mid-lactating cows were 63.4% (OR=0.366, 95% CI=0.150, 0.890) less likely to have a chance of contracting mastitis than cows in the early lactation stage. Crossbreed cows were also 79.1% (OR=0.209, 95% CI=0.046-0.948) less likely to have a chance of contracting mastitis than local breed cows. The odds of subclinical mastitis were 21.81 (95% CI=4.618, 103.002) times higher in cows having tick infestation compared to cows without tick infestation and animals kept in good housing were 23% (OR=0.73, 95% CI=0.027, 0.197) less likely to have mastitis than cows kept in poor housing. The likelihood of mastitis occurrence was 3.372 (95% CI=0.865, 13.141) times higher in cows managed in intensive farming system than semi-intensive farming system. Out of fifty CMT positive milk samples, proportion of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was 17 (34%) and 8 (16%) respectively. As a conclusion, subclinical mastitis is the main important health constraints of dairy cows in the study area. Therefore, management, housing, and environmental sanitation should be improved.

Accurate area-wide crop damage assessment is a challenging task to provide timely relief to farmers. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using multispectral satellite data for mapping crop-damaged area, identification of hailstreaks, their ground track attributes using NDVI difference of pre and post-hailstorm events. Crop classification within hailstreak was performed using a multispectral, high resolution LISS-IV satellite data from IRS-Resourcesat-2. Six hailstorm-damaged streaks were examined in the study area, varying in width ranging from 3 to 8 km, and length ranging from 6 to 33 km. Maximum area damaged was in grapes, followed by sugarcane and papaya. Changes in NDVI profile of different crops in the study area was recorded, and a model was developed for estimating changes in NDVI due to hail damage. The crop classification error matrix indicated Kappa Coefficient (0.55) with an overall classification accuracy of 69.6%. This study discusses the potential of high spectral, spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing data for crop damage assessment in the aftermath of the hailstorms.

Nevertheless, it is unclear how soil microbial and enzyme activities are affected by the application of nanofertilisers to wheat inter-root soil.Aims: The study aims to investigate the influences of nanocarbon (NC) and nano-calcium carbonate (NCC) on soil enzyme activities and microbial community in the open field setting.Methods: The effects of nanofertilisers on soil wheat rhizosphere soil were studied through the evaluation of soil microbial quantity, enzyme activity, and microbial diversity.Results: The findings revealed that the combined utilization of nanofertilizers and compound fertilizers (CF) led to an augmentation in the diversity of the soil microbial community. When comparing the effects of 100% composite nanofertilizers (100% CF + 50% NC + 50% NCC) with the control (CK) (100% CF), it was observed that the activities of urease (EC 3.5.1.5), catalase (EC 1.11.1.6), alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1), sucrase (EC.3.2.1.26), as well as the number of fungi, actinomycetes, and bacteria, increased by 22.4%, 7.7%, 17.8%, 9.3%, 35.9%, 27.7%, and 26.0%, respectively. Similarly, the employment of 70% composite nanofertilizers (70% CF + 35% NC + 35% NCC) also resulted in an enhancement of these aforementioned indicators. The magnitude of increase over the 100% CF was 19.0%, 6.6%, 13.6%, 6.2%, 26.8%, 21.3%, and 23.5%, respectively. Notably, there was no significant difference observed between 100% CF + 50% NC + 50 % NCC and 70% CF + 35% NC + 35% NCC within the 0-35 d after anthesis. Furthermore, both 100% CF + 50% NC + 50% NCC and 70% CF + 35% NC + 35% NCC contributed to an improvement in the species uniformity and operational taxonomic unit abundance of wheat rhizosphere microorganisms, while also increasing the abundance of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria compared to the CK. The relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria was found to be elevated in the nanomaterials-treated groups, both at 0-7 d and 14-21 d after anthesis, and positively correlated with soil enzyme activities and soil microbial populations.Conclusions: These results indicate that the application of composite nanofertilizers can enhance the soil microenvironment in wheat fields, particularly under reduced fertilization conditions.

We extracted the crude toxin protein from a liquid culture broth of an isolated C. fumosorosea strain using the ammonium sulfate precipitation method, and its toxicity to Myzus persicae was measured by injection, oral exposure, and topical exposure. The crude toxin protein of C. fumosorosea had insecticidal activity against M. persicae. Body cavity injection and oral exposure had significantly higher insec-ticidal activity against adults than contact sprays. The highest cumulative corrected mortality of adults after injection was 81.85 +/- 13.45 %, and the highest cumulative corrected mortality of adults after ingestion was 85.45 +/- 11.88 %. The proportion of plasmatocytes in adult blood lymphocytes reached the highest at 3 days after injection and feeding, and the proportion of granulocytes was the highest at 2 days after injection and feeding. These data confirmed the toxicity of the crude toxin protein of C. fumosorosea toxin to M. persicae and helped clarify the pathogenic mechanism of the strain. Population management of M. persicae may be possible by using a natural toxic compound produced by C. fumosorosea that is selective to this pest species.					ma, rui/JGE-4890-2023	Diao, Hongliang/0000-0002-8654-7028													0022-2011	1096-0805				OCT	2022	194								107825	10.1016/j.jip.2022.107825	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2022.107825		SEP 2022						36096179					WOS:000869523600004

Criteria based decisions for determining agroclimatic onset of the crop growing season	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Success of rainfed crop production is highly dependent on timely sowing/planting decisions. Variability in sowing/planting dates between years affect crop planning and thus could decrease farm profitability. Therefore, information on the optimum crop sowing window for the season will facilitate crop planning by farmers and other stakeholders. To determine optimum sowing window over 19 Agro-Ecological Regions (AER) of India, three methods viz., Soil Water Balance (SWB), Depth and modified Morris & Zandesta methods were evaluated to identify the most suitable method for working out the onset dates of the crop growing season. The onset dates of growing season determined by three methods were found to be similar over northeastern (hot sub-humid and warm per-humid eco-region), west coast (hot humid to per-humid), cold and hot arid eco-regions in India. However, differences in onset dates of the crop growing season were observed over hot semi-arid to sub-humid eco-region. SWB method was found to be the most suitable based on validating with observed crop sowing dates, false start and number of undefined onset years criteria. However, as SWB method is data-intensive, onset was determined using an alternative Modified Threshold Combination (MTC) method comprising 40 combinations of threshold values viz. rainfall amount, wet spell duration, dry spell duration and dry spell search period. The onset dates determined by MTC and SWB methods were validated and subsequently, appropriate threshold values were identified to work out onset dates in 19 AERs of India. This study revealed that the onset is not influenced by threshold combinations in per-humid, humid and sub-humid regions. However, in semi-arid and arid regions, critical evaluation of criteria for determining onset is vital to avoid false starts and undefined onset years. Information on agroclimatic onset dates for each AER is useful for improving practical utility/decision making, especially in the semi-arid and arid regions of India.

J	Malik, DP; Devi, M; Reddy, AA				Malik, D. P.; Devi, Monika; Reddy, A. Amarender			Global status of lentil production with special reference to India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES												India needs to increase it pulse production to meet the growing demand. Lentil is one of the important pulse crop grown in winter season in tropical and subtropical regions of world. The study analysed the trends in production and trade scenario in India and globally from 2000-2018 and came out with strategies for increasing production. The state-wise analysis was carried out for major producing states like Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Rajasthan from 2000-2019. The lentil production in the world reached around 6.33 million tonnes in 2018 with an annual growth rate of 4.4% since last 20 years. Asia alone contributed more than half of total global lentil production. The share of American and Oceania regions in global lentil production increased in recent years. There was increase in lentil yield in recent years in Africa, Asia and American regions due to adoption of improved production technologies. India and Canada together contributed more than 50% of total world lentil production. Lentil yield was highest in Canada (1425 kg/ha), lowest in India (744 kg/ha) in 2018. The lentil production in India touched 1.47 million tonnes with larger share contributed by Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal in 2018. India is the leading importing nation sharing more than one-fourth of total world import during last five years. Adoption of drought, heat, biotic stresses tolerant high yielding cultivars are required to meet estimated demand of 2.00 million tonnes by 2030.

J	Tiwari, YK; Yadav, SK				Tiwari, Yogesh Kumar; Yadav, Sushil Kumar			Effect of High-Temperature Stress on Ascorbate-Glutathione Cycle in Maize	AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												High-temperature stress induces cellular changes leading to over-production of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) which damage macromolecules and cell organelles, eventually resulting in cell death. Antioxidative metabolism in plants comprising of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants imparts tolerance by scavenging or detoxification of excess ROS. We investigated the response of major H2O2-detoxifying system, the AsA-GSH cycle in four genotypes of maize differing in heat sensitivity. Stress was imposed by staggered sowing so that one set of plants faced high-temperature stress at their anthesis-silking stage. The concentrations of H2O2 increased across the genotypes by high temperature; however, the increase was lesser in tolerant genotypes: NSJ 189 and NSJ 221. High-temperature stress led to an increase in the level of GSH and GSSG in all the genotypes, whereas GSH/GSSG decreased in sensitive genotypes: PSRJ 13099 and RJR 270. The glutathione S-transferase activity increased significantly under heat stress. APX, MDHAR and DHAR activities decreased under heat stress in the sensitive group. Under high temperature, GR activity remained unchanged in sensitive genotypes, while it increased significantly in tolerant genotypes. Ascorbate levels increased in tolerant genotypes, while a decline was observed in sensitive genotypes. Isoforms of APX showed some new bands in tolerant genotypes as well as higher intensity of the existing ones as compared to sensitive genotypes under stress conditions. Isoforms of GR did not show any genotypic differences under heat stress. Findings emphasized the importance and complexity of the AsA-GSH system in fine-tuning the redox metabolism under heat stress in maize. The study also suggested that the antioxidative enzymes of AsA-GSH cycle play a key role in sustaining the ROS homeostasis in cells, thus minimizing the potential toxic effects of ROS.

Effect of Different Levels of Surface Application of Sorghum Residue under Minimum Tillage on Crop Yields and Sustainable Yield Index of Sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i> (L.) Moench) and Cowpea (<i>Vigna unguiculata</i> (L.) Walp) and Nutrient Status in Rainfed Alfisol Soils	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS												In order to assess the effect of surface application of sorghum residue under minimum tillage on crop yields sustainable yield index (SYI), agronomic efficiency (AE), and soil fertility in sorghum-cowpea system, a long-term study was conducted in rainfed Alfisols. The results of the study revealed that surface residue application increased the crop yields significantly over the control ie no residue application, with SYI ranging from 0.52 in no residue application (T1) to 0.70 in residue application @ 4 tha(-1) (T3) for sorghum and from 0.01 in residue application @ 2 tha(-1) (T2) to 0.08 in residue application @ 6 tha(-1) (T4) in cowpea. The AE of the recommended N applied varied from 24.42 to 31.60 in case of sorghum and 10.38 to 13.40 kg grain kg(-1) N in cowpea, respectively. The content of soil organic carbon (SOC) after 12 years of experiment ranged from 4.47 to 6.62 g kg(-1) and decreased with the soil depth. The level of mean available nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) in soil were 154.07-403.45, 5.28-14.07, and 118.17-268.17 kgha(-1), while the total N, P, and K varied from 330.0 to 1033.0, 194.9 to 395.7, and 13355 to 22133 mg kg(-1), respectively. The available zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), and copper (Cu) in soil ranged from 0.08 to 0.98, 9.10 to 38.81,1.85 to 10.58, and 0.75 to 1.64 mg kg(-1), while the total Zn, Mn, Fe and Cu ranged from 21.75 to 86.58, 343.0 to 877.83, 15202 to 33646, and 24.17 to 82.00 mg kg(-1), respectively. When the crop yields were regressed with organic carbon (OC) and total and available soil nutrients, the coefficients of multiple determinations (R-2) were 0.959 and 0.970 (P = .05 and P = .01) for available soil nutrients and 0.944 and 0.827, for total nutrients, respectively. The OC, available N and Zn contents and total K and Mn have positively influenced yields of both the crops in these soils.																			0010-3624	1532-2416				JAN 19	2022	53	2					268	280		10.1080/00103624.2021.1993883	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2021.1993883		OCT 2021											WOS:000710366800001

Currently, the local seed system is limited to landraces and hybrids that are primarily used for domestic grain and fodder purposes. This study aimed to understand the farmers' needs and context, and use this knowledge to deliver relevant, adoptable climate-smart sorghum crop technologies through farmer-participatory approaches (FPAs). We conducted an ex-ante survey with 103 farmer households to understand their preferences and constraints concerning sorghum, their staple food-crop. Farmers expressed taste as the most important characteristic, followed by stover yield, grain yield, drought adaptation, and pest resistance. They identified fodder deficit, loss of seed purity in landraces, and lack of diverse sorghum seed options as critical constraints. Therefore, we chose dual-purpose, open-pollinated sorghum varieties suitable for postrainy/rabi cultivation as the study site's entry point. Accordingly, sixteen popular rabi sorghum varieties were tested at ICRISAT station (2017-18 and 2018-19) for agronomic performance in field conditions under a range of treatments (irrigation and fertilization). The standing crop was also scored by farmer representatives. Additionally, the detailed lysifield study elucidated the plant functions underlying the crop agronomic performance under water stress (plant water use and stay-green score) and an important trait of farmer's interest (relation between stay-green score and in-vitro stover digestibility and relation between grain fat and protein content) The selected varieties- Phule Chitra, CSV22, M35-1 and preferred landrace (Sevata jonna)-were further tested with 21 farmers at Adilabad (2018-20). Participating farmers from both the trials and focus group discussions voiced their preference and willingness to adopt Phule Chitra and CSV22. This article summarizes how system-relevant crop options were selected for subsistence farmers of Adilabad and deployed using participatory approaches. While varieties are developed for wider adoption, farmers adopt only those suitable for their farm, household, and accessible market. Therefore, we strongly advocate FPA for developing and delivering farmer relevant crop technologies as a vehicle to systematically break crop adoption barriers and create a positive impact on household diets, well-being, and livelihoods, especially for smallholder subsistence farmers.

Freezing stress caused by sudden temperature drops, such as late-spring coldness, often occurs in the seedling stage of foxtail millet. However, the ability and coping strategies of foxtail millet to cope with such stress are not clear. In the present study, we analyzed the self-regulatory mechanisms of freezing stress in foxtail millet. We conducted a physiological study on foxtail millet leaves at -4 & DEG;C for seven different durations (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h). Longer freezing time increased cell-membrane damage, relative conductance, and malondialdehyde content. This led to osmotic stress in the leaves, which triggered an increase in free proline, soluble sugar, and soluble protein contents. The increases in these substances helped to reduce the damage caused by stress. The activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) content. The optimal time point for the response to freezing stress was 8 h after exposure. The transcriptome analysis of samples held for 8 h at -4 & DEG;C revealed 6862 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), among which the majority are implicated in various pathways, including the starch and sucrose metabolic pathways, antioxidant enzyme pathways, brassinolide (BR) signaling pathway, and transcription factors, according to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment. We investigated possible crosstalk between BR signals and other pathways and found that BR signaling molecules were induced in response to freezing stress. The beta-amylase (BAM) starch hydrolase signal was enhanced by the BR signal, resulting in the accelerated degradation of starch and the formation of sugars, which served as emerging ROS scavengers and osmoregulators to resist freezing stress. In conclusion, crosstalk between BR signal transduction, and both starch and sucrose metabolism under freezing stress provides a new perspective for improving freezing resistance in foxtail millet.

J	Mauget, S; Ulloa, M; Dever, J				Mauget, Steven; Ulloa, Mauricio; Dever, Jane			Planting Date Effects on Cotton Lint Yield and Fiber Quality in the U.S. Southern High Plains	AGRICULTURE-BASEL												Cotton planting date effects in the U.S. Southern High Plains (SHP) were evaluated based on 11 years of May-planted and June-planted irrigated variety trials. Multiple cultivars planted in each year's trial allowed for the calculation of 153 yield effects and 162 effects in 5 fiber quality parameters. Yield and quality effects were considered in the context of related changes in total growing season degree days (GDD(S)) and total cool hours (CHRS) during a boll formation period 80 to 110 days after planting. May planting increased GDD(S) and significantly increased yields in 8 of 10 years that comparisons could be made. Micronaire and fiber elongation were the most sensitive quality parameters to planting date. June planting resulted in increased CHRS every year and a significantly higher incidence of low micronaire in 7 of 11 years. In 7 of 11 years May planting significantly reduced fiber elongation relative to June planting. Analysis of SHP temperature data show that late-April to early-May planting dates may increase yield and micronaire by maximizing GDD(S) and minimizing CHRS. Although this practice may be optimal to the SHP environment it may also require high-vigor seed and pre-planting irrigation. Adapting genetics to an early planting strategy might include selecting for improved seed vigor and cold germination with acceptable yield and fiber quality traits.

The study site is one of the climate change prone areas affected by climate variability and extreme events. Therefore, a better understanding of area-specific and adaptation is crucial to develop and implement proper adaptation strategies that can alleviate the adverse effects of climate change. Therefore, this work was aimed to identify determinants of farmers' adoption of climate change adaptation strategies in Gondar Zuria District of northwestern Ethiopia. Primary data were collected through semi-structured questionnaires, observation, and interviews. Besides, the secondary data were also obtained from journal articles, reports, governmental offices, and the internet. The Multinomial and Binary logistic regression models with the help of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) (21th edition) were used to analyze the data. The multinomial logistic regression model was used to estimate the influence of the socioeconomic characteristics of sample households on the farmer's decision to choose climate change adaptation strategies. The result showed that age, gender, family size, farm income, and farm size had a significant influence on the farmers' choice of climate change adaptation strategies. The result also revealed that crop failure, severe soil erosion and shortages of water are major climate change-related problems than others. In order to alleviate these problems, farmers have implemented mixed farming, mixed cropping, early and late planting (changing sowing period), use of drought-resistant crop varieties, application of soil and water conservation techniques, shifting to non-farm income activities and use of irrigation. In contrast, access to climate information, total annual farm income, and market access variables are significant adoption determinants of climate change adaptation strategies by farmers' in the study site. Therefore, we recommend future adaptation-related plans should focus on improving climate change information access, improving market access and enhancing research on the use of rainwater harvesting technology.

Maize white spot (MWS) is an important disease in Southwest China that always seriously reduces production. However, knowledge about the genetic mechanism of MWS resistance is limited. In this paper, a panel of 143 elite lines were collected and genotyped by using the MaizeSNP50 chip with approximately 60,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and evaluated for resistance to MWS among 3 environments, and a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and transcriptome analysis were integrated to reveal the function of the identity-by-descent (IBD) segments for MWS. The results showed that (1) 225 IBD segments were identified only in the FP QB512, 192 were found only in the FP QR273 and 197 were found only in the FP HCL645. (2) The GWAS results showed that 15 common quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) were associated with MWS. Interestingly, SYN10137 and PZA00131.14 were in the IBD segments of QB512, and the SYN10137-PZA00131.14 region existed in more than 58% of QR273 & PRIME;s descendants. (3) By integrating the GWAS and transcriptome analysis, Zm00001d031875 was found to located in the region of SYN10137-PZA00131.14. These results provide some new insights for the detection of MWS's genetic variation mechanisms.																			1661-6596	1422-0067				JUN	2023	24	12							10005	10.3390/ijms241210005	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms241210005								37373152					WOS:001017458700001

Twenty-one main foxtail millet cultivars in China were evaluated for the drought resistance by measuring their main agronomic traits and photosynthetic indicators under the condition of drought stress and normal irrigation. Identifying the drought resistance is difficult when using a single index. The order of drought resistance of tested foxtail millet cultivars based on drought resistance comprehensive evaluation values (D value) and drought resistance index (DRI value) differed to an extent; therefore, a comprehensive evaluation method combining D and DRI values was appropriate and accurate. Gray correlation analysis showed that the grain weight per ear, yield, ear weight, and ear length could be used as indicators for drought-resistance evaluation of foxtail millet cultivars at the mature stage. According to the clustering analysis based on D and DRI values, the tested cultivars were divided into three grades of drought resistance and six foxtail millet cultivars with strong drought resistance were identified. The photosynthetic indicators showed that the net photosynthetic and transpiration rates and D and DRI values had correlation coefficients greater than 0.320.																			2040-2244	2408-9354				JUL	2023	14	7					2384	2396		10.2166/wcc.2023.086	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2023.086		JUN 2023											WOS:001012808900001

This study was conducted (i) to estimate genetic variability among 25 durum wheat genotypes in response to drought based on grain yield and 15 agro-physiological traits in single and multi-year trials; and (ii) to compare genotypes on the basis of multiple investigated traits using genotype by trait (GT) biplot technique and then recommend possible selection strategies. We found large genetic differences among durum wheat genotypes for agro-physiological traits in response to drought stress within and between single years, which revealed good promise in their further exploitation for selection in durum wheat breeding program. High broad-sense heritability and expected genetic advance as percent of mean observed in plant height (90.8%; 52.7%), grain yield (53.6%, 23.5%) and relative water loss (47.2%, 41.3%), respectively, indicated a major role of additive gene action. The results showed that the performance of genotypes was influenced by the year. The traits with high consistence across years were heading date, plant height and peduncle length. The potential quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) and thousand-kernel weight (TKW) were positively associated with grain yield, while heading date, plant height and canopy temperature (CT) were negatively associated with grain yield under the drought conditions. In conclusion, based on across-year analyses, Fv/Fm, TKW, heading date, plant height and CT are the most promising traits for indirect selection.

The effects of compound water retention agents on nutrient content and soil microbial diversity of saline winter wheat soils were investigated in a field experiment with no water retention agent (CK) and 30 kg hm(2) of commercial attapulgite water retention agent (T4) as control and different amounts of compound water retention agents as treatments (15 kg hm(2)-T1, 30 kg hm(2)-T2, 45 kg hm(2)-T3). The study showed that the application of water retention agents increased the soil water content. From anthesis to harvest stage, the decreases in soil alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen, available phosphorus, available potassium and organic matter content were greater in T2 and T3 than in the other treatments. At harvest stage, the alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen content of T2 was significantly lower than that of CK and T4 6.19-8.83% and 4.62-5.39%, respectively. The soil available phosphorus content of T2 was significantly lower than that of CK 8.14-8.83%. The relative abundance of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria as well as the Shannon and Simpson indices of T2 reached their maximum at harvest stage. T2 showed the best performance in terms of overall number of OTUs. The compound water retention agent may regulate soil nutrient content and accelerate plant nutrient accumulation by regulating soil water content and soil microbial abundance composition.

Fodder grass-strip-based systems improve soil's physical and biological properties, control soil erosion, and help in slope stabilization without compromising productivity. Permanent fodder grass strips can effectively check the depletion of soil nutrients and can also act as sediment traps vis-a-vis meeting the green fodder requirement for small ruminants. This study was carried out with the major objective to quantify the impact of grass-strip-based cropping systems on soil quality. Further fodder quality assessment was carried out using the grass quality index for small ruminant feed and the profitability of different treatments was analyzed. Random block design (RBD) with three treatments which included two types of fodder grass (Brachiaria ruziziensis and Stylosanthes hamata) on both sides of the cropped field was used for the study. The results showed that the soil quality increased from 0.39 to 0.52 and the runoff reduced significantly with soil loss reduction by 65-70 percent. The fodder quality assessment showed that the palatability of Stylosanthes hamata and Brachiaria ruziziensis was about 65 percent and 40 percent, respectively. The fodder grass strip increased the net returns by 30 percent. This easily adaptable natural resource management technology reduces soil nutrient loss and will help resource-poor rainfed farmers to maintain soil health and productivity under variable rainfall conditions with fair support to small ruminants.					, Pushpanjali/P-6350-2018; Pankaj, Prabhat Kumar/E-7876-2010	, Pushpanjali/0000-0002-3213-2839; Pankaj, Prabhat Kumar/0000-0002-3997-7885														2077-0472				FEB	2023	13	2							318	10.3390/agriculture13020318	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13020318													WOS:000937763400001

A case study in Afar region	HELIYON												Sweet potato is in its introductory phase as a food-based approach to alleviate malnutrition in the Afar region, where, due to climate change, agricultural drought impedes crop production. This study assesses the impact of climate change on orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) fresh storage root yield production over the Afar region using the Aqua Crop model. This model was fed with daily rainfall and minimum and maximum temperature datasets, for the baseline climate (1980-2009) as well as future (2010-2099) climate projections under two representative concentration pathways: RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. These datasets were statistically downscaled from twenty (20) general circulation models that are used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The impact of climate change on sweet potatoes was assessed by comparing the change in average sweet potato yields in the baseline climate condition against the average of simulated sweet potato yields in the Near-term (NT) (2010-2039), Mid-term (MT) (2040-2069), and End-term (ET) (2070-2099) under RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5. Simulation shows increased future storage root yield production for NT (3.23%), MT (3.90%), and ET (7.25%) under RCP 4.5 and MT (5.88%) and NT (6.71%) from the observed yield data (32.0 t/ha) except for Near-term (-9.59%) under RCP 8.5. Similarly, projected climate shows increase in temperature Tmax (0.93-4.10 degrees C), Tmin (0.88-4.54 degrees C) and precipitation (28.9-37.8%) under both RCPs which will favor sweet potato yield production increase in near-term, mid-term reaching climax in end-term. Simulation with planting dates shows that normal planting date (July 01), gives better yields than early (April 22) or late planting (01 August). This finding may perhaps be used as preliminary data in adoption and upscaling of orange-fleshed sweet potato in Afar region.

Field plot experiments under varying inflow rates (6-36 L min(-1)m(-1)) and slope gradients (26, 42 and 57%) were conducted to address this issue. The results showed soil loss rates significantly demonstrated temporal variability in relevance to the rill developing process. Rill erosion and its contribution to soil loss increased with increasing inflow rates and slope gradients by power functions. There was a threshold inflow discharge (12-24 L min(-1)m(-1)), under which, rill erosion became the dominant erosion pattern. At the initial stage, downcutting of rill bottom and headward erosion were obvious, whereas rill broadening was significant at the actively rill developing period. Rill density increased with slope gradient increasing from 26% to 42%, and then decreased. For the 57% slope under high inflow rates (24-36 L min(-1)m(-1)), gravity caused an increase in the collapse of rills. Mean rill width increased with increasing inflow rates but decreased as slope gradients increased, while mean rill depth increased with increasing inflow rates and slope gradients. Stream power and rill flow velocity were the best hydrodynamic parameter to simulate rill erosion and rill morphology, respectively.

Nanotechnology can improve agricultural productivity by affecting the photosynthetic activity of plants. However, no studies have yet shown that nano-calcium carbonate (NCC) can play a role in improving photosynthetic performance of plants. In order to explore the effects of NCC on wheat seedling morphology, antioxidant enzyme activities and photosynthetic parameters, wheat roots were exposed to different concentrations of NCC (0, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400 mg L-1) through hydroponic experiments. Different concentrations affected root length, root surface area, root diameter, root volume and plant dry biomass. Compared to the control (0 mg L-1 of NCC) application (CK), wheat with 200 mg L-1 of NCC application showed 54% and 58% increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities, respectively. As for photosynthesis-related physiological indicators, compared with CK, 200 mg L-1 of NCC significantly enhanced chlorophyll a (38%), chlorophyll b (20%), carotenoid content (19%), Rubisco activity (3.02-fold), net photosynthetic rate (Pn, 56%), transpiration rate (Tr, 40%), and stomatal conductance (Gs, 71%). The PCR results showed that compared with CK, the psbA gene encoding the photosystem PSII reaction center D1 protein and the rbcL gene encoding the large subunit of Rubisco were up-regulated by 2.56- and 2.58-fold at 200 mg L-1 NCC treatment, and by 3.22- and 3.57-fold at 400 mg L-1 NCC treatment, respectively. Specifically, NCC has significant benefits on wheat seedling growth, and 200 mg L-1 is the optimal concentration. NCC enhanced photosynthetic performance of wheat by increasing antioxidant enzyme activity, photosynthetic pigment content, Rubisco activity, stomatal conductance and PSII reaction center activity.

With the aim of clarifying whether the application of glufosinate-ammonium will gen-erate residue in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and soil, ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was used to detect wheat plants, grains, and soil. Under experimental conditions, no residue of glufosinate-ammonium was detected in wheat plants and grains during each growth period. The residual level of glufosinate decreased gradually with the increment of soil layer during the same reproductive period. In the same soil layer, the sequence of glufosinate residues in the reproductive period were wintering, recovering, jointing, and heading stage. The residues of glufosinate after 2.0 times applied amount was signifi-cantly greater than the 1.0 times applied amount. During the wintering period, the residuals after 2.0 times appli-cation of glufosinate were 1.50 and 28.27 times higher than 1.0 times application in the field and soil column experiment, respectively, in the 0-20 cm soil layer. No residue of glufosinate was detected in the different soil layers of each treatment during the flowering, filling, and maturation stages of wheat. The residues of glufosinate-ammonium in wheat and soil were far less than 0.2 ng kg-1 in all treatments. It shows that the application of glufosinate-ammonium is safe for wheat field soil and the next crop under the spraying rate of this experiment.

And two water levels (I1 and I2) and four fertilization levels (F1, F2, F3 and F4) were set. In terms of flag leaf light and performance of wheat, reasonable irrigation and fertilization (I1F1 and I1F4) of wheat can maintain a higher concentration of chlorophyll content, increase Gs, Pn and Tr, and reduce Ci. The Tr in I2F2 and I2F3 of wheat was very small, which was not conducive to CO2 assimilation and to photosynthesis in wheat. In regard to nutrient utilization, the contents of N, P and K contents in roots, stems and leaves of wheat decreased gradually from elongation stage to filling stage. Reasonable coupled treatment (I1F1, I1F3, and I1F4) of water and fertilizer could increase the contents of N, P and K in root, stem and leaf of wheat. The results showed that I1F1 and I1F3 treatments played a favorable role in the photosynthetic performance of flag leaves and plant nutrient utilization, indicating that the treatment with 60 mm irrigation amount was more conducive to photosynthesis and plant nutrient utilization of wheat.

Field	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS												In this study, the efficiency of fertilizers was improved by coating the fertilizers with a hydrogel formed by the polymerization of itaconic acid (IA), maleic acid (MA), acrylic acid (AA), and potassium persulfate (KPS) to form a synergistic fertilizer and improve its slow-release performance. The effect of synergistic fertilizers on the changes in soil nutrients in wheat fields was studied through field and soil column experiments using ordinary and commercial synergistic fertilizers as controls and different application rates of `synergistic fertilizers as treatments. The results revealed that the alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen (N) and total N contents were significantly higher in T1 than that in CK, and the treatments were ranked as T3 > T2 > T5 > T1 > CK > T4. The difference in the alkali-hydrolyzed N and total N contents between CK and T3 was significant. In terms of available phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) contents, the treatments were ranked as T1 > T4 > T2 > CK > T3 in all soil layers and T3 > T2 > T5 > T1 > CK > T4 in the soil column. The treatments were ranked as T4>CK>T3>T1>T2 in terms of soil organic matter (SOM) content. Compared with ordinary fertilizers, synergistic fertilizers could significantly increase the soil total N, alkali-hydrolyzed N, available P, and available K contents. Compared with ordinary slow-release fertilizers in the market, the effect of synergistic fertilizers is better in improving the use efficiency of fertilizers. By slowly releasing nutrients, synergistic fertilizers can continuously provide nutrients for the growth and development of wheat and improve the use efficiency of fertilizer.

The aim is to explore the potential of soluble straw HS in remediating heavy metal pollution in soils. The study characterizes straw decomposition structures using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), while employing gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and fluorescence spectroscopy (EEM) to analyze the molecular weight and degree of humification of extracted straw HS. The removal efficiency of HS for heavy metals is assessed, with a focus on aerobic humic substances (AE-HS) showing the highest potential for heavy metal removal. Spectral analysis and mass spectrometry analysis reveal the role of phenolic compounds, carboxylic acids, and aromatic compounds in AE -HS, forming humates or complexes to remove heavy metals from contaminated soil. Notably, the optimized AE -HS achieved the highest removal efficiency of 96.18 %, 82.75 %, 60.43 %, and 41.66 % for cadmium, copper, zinc, and lead, respectively. This study provides new insights into the preparation of straw for use as a heavy metal remover and has implications for the use of straw humic substances in soil remediation.

Pest scenario of <i>Spodoptera litura</i> (Fab.) on groundnut under representative concentration pathways (RCPs) based climate change scenarios	JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY												Multi-model ensemble of Maximum (Tmax) and Minimum (Tmin) temperature data of four Representative Concentration Pathways viz., RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5 of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) models were generated for ten major groundnut growing locations of the India to predict the number of generations of Spodoptera litura (Fab.) using Growing Degree Days approach during three future climate viz., Near (NF), Distant (DF) and Very Distant (VDF) periods and were compared over 1976-2005 baseline period (BL). Projections indicate significant increase in Tmax (0.7-4.7. degrees C) and Tmin (0.7-5.1 degrees C) in NF, DF and VDF periods under the four RCP scenarios at the ten groundnut growing locations. Higher percent increase of the number of generations of S. litura was predicted to occur in VDF (6-38%) over baseline, followed by DF (5-22%) and NF (4-9%) periods with reduction of generation time (5-26%) across the four RCP scenarios. Reduction of crop duration was higher (12-22 days) in long duration groundnut than in medium and short duration groundnut. Decrease in crop duration was higher in VDF (12.1-20.8 days) than DF (8.26-13.15 days) and NF (4.46-6.15 days) climate change periods under RCP 8.5 scenario. Increase in number of generations of S. litura was predicted even with altered crop duration of groundnut. Among locations, more number of generations of S. litura with reduced generation time are likely at Vridhachalam and Tirupathi locations. Geographical location (74-77%) and climate period (15-19%), together explained over 90 percent of the total variation in the number of generations and generation time of S. litura. These findings suggest that the incidence of S. litura on groundnut could be higher in future.

Mobilizing crop diversity could be an efficient way to mitigate its impact. We test this hypothesis in pearl millet, a nutritious staple cereal cultivated in arid and low-fertility soils in sub-Saharan Africa. We analyze the genomic diversity of 173 landraces collected in West Africa together with an extensive climate dataset composed of metrics of agronomic importance. Mapping the pearl millet genomic vulnerability at the 2050 horizon based on the current genomic-climate relationships, we identify the northern edge of the current areas of cultivation of both early and late flowering varieties as being the most vulnerable to climate change. We predict that the most vulnerable areas will benefit from using landraces that already grow in equivalent climate conditions today. However, such seed-exchange scenarios will require long distance and trans-frontier assisted migrations. Leveraging genetic diversity as a climate mitigation strategy in West Africa will thus require regional collaboration. Replacement of local crops with alternative varieties adapted to future conditions may improve food security under climate change. Here the authors apply landscape genomics and ensemble climate modelling to pearl millet in West Africa, supporting the potential of transfrontier assisted seed exchange.

COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS												The application of nanomaterials in agriculture has considerable advantages, but its impact on the dynamic change of soil nutrients is still unclear. In the two-year experiment, the effects of nanocarbon (NC) and nano calcium carbonate (NCC) on the dynamic changes of soil nutrients in the wheat field were studied by setting the ratio of different nanomaterials and fertilizers. All treatments with NC and NCC applications positively affected soil nutrient effectiveness at 0-35 d after wheat anthesis, and the effect of NC+NCC was more significant. At 35 days after anthesis, soil available phosphorus (P), available potassium (K), organic matter (OM), and alkaline hydrolysis nitrogen (N) were elevated by 77.9%, 21.9%, 11.7%, and 7.0%, respectively, in the first year and 44.3%, 10.2%, 9.0%, and 7.6%, respectively, in the second year of treatment with 100% CF (complex fertilizer) + 50% NC + 50% NCC compared with control. The treatment with reduced fertilizer application also demonstrated a greater advantage. At 35 d after anthesis, 70% CF + 35% NC + 35% NCC had 54.3%, 11.5%, 8.4%, and 5.8% higher soil available P, available K, OM, and alkaline hydrolysis N, respectively, compared with the control, and 41.05%, 6.4%, 7.8%, and 5.4% higher the following year, respectively. In acidic soils, positively charged NC and NCC have a lasting effect on maintaining soil nutrients by adsorbing acid ions. Therefore, NC and NCC with compound fertilizer have favorable effects in maintaining soil nutrient content and improving fertilizer utilization.

Organic farming is reported to improve nutritional quality of food grains while also improving soil health. However, sufficient scientific information on several aspects of organic farming based on long-term studies is lacking particularly under rainfed conditions of India. The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term impact of organic and integrated production systems on crops yield and quality, economic returns and soil properties. The study was conducted with three crops, sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.), and greengram [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek] under three different production systems, control (use of chemical inputs alone), organic and integrated. The results of the 10-year study revealed that, the average production of integrated system was on par with organic management and recorded significantly higher pigeonpea equivalent yield (PEY) (827 kg ha(-1)) compared to control (chemical inputs) (748 kg ha(-1)). In general, the yield gap between organic and integrated production systems declined from fourth year for greengram and eighth year for sunflower, during the 10-year experimental period whereas the pigeonpea yield was similar under both production systems from first year. Plots under organic management had significantly lower bulk density (1.18 mg m(-3)), higher water holding capacity (38.72%) and porosity (53.79%) compared to integrated production system and control (chemical inputs). The soil organic C (SOC) content in the plots under organic production system was 32.6% more than the initial organic carbon of the soil (0.43%), with higher soil N (205.2 kg ha(-1)). Plots under integrated production system, however, had higher soil P (26.5 kg ha(-1)) compared with other treatments. The dehydrogenase activity (5.86 mu g TPF g(-1) soil h(-1)) and microbial biomass carbon (317.3 mu g g(-1) soil) content was higher in the plots under organic production system than under other systems. Organically produced pigeonpea and greengram seeds had similar protein content with that of integrated system, and higher K and micronutrient (Fe, Zn, Cu, and Mn) contents than other treatments. The results show the potential of organic production system in improving crop yields, soil properties and produce quality in semiarid rainfed areas.																			2296-861X					MAY 10	2023	10								1127970	10.3389/fnut.2023.1127970	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2023.1127970								37234556					WOS:000993525400001
J	Hao, ZH; Shi, Y				Hao, Zenghui; Shi, Yan			A Comparative Study of Fourier Transform Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and Physicochemical Methods in Wheat Quality Analysis	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												Near-infrared spectroscopy is a non-invasive, rapid, and efficient analytical method widely employed in agricultural quality assessment. This study aims to explore the potential of Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy in the analysis of wheat quality in comparison to traditional physicochemical methods. Key quality parameters such as protein content, bulk density, dough extensibility, development and stability time, wet gluten, and extension area were considered. To compare the similarities between the two methods in an irregular manner and to make the trials more representative, randomized combinations of different samples were made by planting different wheat genotypes in different locations. In wheat protein determination (r = 0.92, p < 0.001), the correlation between protein determinations was very high and highly statistically significant. This indicates that the Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) assay is highly consistent and accurate with the physicochemical method for protein determination. In the quality indices of bulk density (r = 0.46, p < 0.05), dough extensibility (r = 0.46, p < 0.05), development time (r = 0.37, p < 0.05), stability time (r = 0.49, p < 0.01), wet gluten (r = 0.54, p < 0.01), and dough extension area (r = 0.63, p < 0.001), there was a positive correlation between the two assays. Although the correlation was lower compared to the protein assay, it was still statistically significant. This suggests that the FT-NIR assay also has some accuracy in these indices, although there may be some differences from the physicochemical method. Through comparative analysis, we found that in wheat quality assessment, FT-NIR showed a strong correlation and was highly significant in the determination of wheat protein content; in the determination of the extension area, although highly significant, the correlation coefficient was not high, and there was a positive correlation between the two, and a lower correlation was shown in the bulk density, dough extensibility, and development time. These results indicate that FT-NIR can assess the wheat protein content quality indicator. However, its ability to accurately assess wheat quality indicators such as density, dough extensibility, development and stability time, wet gluten, and dough extensibility needs further investigation.																				2076-3417				OCT	2023	13	20							11368	10.3390/app132011368	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app132011368													WOS:001093381500001

Four different dosages: 0, 45, 90 and 135kg/ha were applied. Results showed that the chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate of wheat flag leaf firstly increased and then decreased with the increase of levels of potassium silicate fertilizer. By the change of SPAD values after flowering, when the application of potassium silicate fertilizer was 90 kg/ha, the existence time of chlorophyll in flag leaf was significantly long, and the net photosynthetic rate was significantly increased. The 1000-grain weight of winter wheat significantly increased and the yield the highest. Overall, when the applied amount of potassium silicate fertilizer was 90 kg/ha, the performances of winter wheat were best.																			0253-5416	2079-9926				DEC	2021	50	4					1127	1132		10.3329/bjb.v50i4.57080	http://dx.doi.org/10.3329/bjb.v50i4.57080													WOS:000756037500015
J	Luo, YJ; Huang, LM; Yuan, DG				Luo, Yuan -Jun; Huang, Lai -Ming; Yuan, Da -Gang			Characteristics and controls of inorganic and organic phosphorus transformation during long-term paddy soil evolution	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Information on phosphorus (P) transformation during long-term paddy soil evolution is important for main-taining rice yield and nutrient management. This study was aimed to reveal the characteristics and controls of inorganic and organic P transformation during paddy soil evolution over a millennial time scale using both sequential chemical extraction and solution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results show that the rate and trajectory of P evolution in the topsoil differ markedly from that of the illuvial horizon. The amount of apatite P, non-occluded P, occluded P and total P in the topsoils increased rapidly during the early stage of paddy soil evolution (< 50 yrs) due to anthropogenic P additions, but declined in the older paddy soils due to the leaching loss of P sorbents (CaCO3 and Fe/Al oxides); thus, the added P cannot be efficiently retained by the older paddy soils. Total organic P including phosphate monoester in the topsoils reached maximum in the 300-yr paddy soil and declined thereafter. However, the phosphate diester pool (including DNA) and its proportion in the topsoil increased continuously across the paddy soil chronosequence, suggesting that long-term paddy cultivation promoted labile organic P accumulation. In the deeper soil horizons with less human impacts, the temporal trends in inorganic and organic P across the paddy soil chronosequence can be fully predicted by previous established P transformation models during natural pedogenesis, although the rates of P changes differ among different sites. Our study demonstrates that long-term paddy cultivation alters the rate and trajectory of inorganic and organic P transformation in the topsoils over a millennial time scale, and highlights the importance of labile organic P activation for nutrient supply in the older paddy soils.																			0167-1987	1879-3444				OCT	2022	224								105524	10.1016/j.still.2022.105524	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2022.105524		AUG 2022											WOS:000847848000001

Thus, this research study was initiated with the objective of evaluating different seed-dressing fungicides with different chickpea varieties for the management of fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. ciceris) in Eastern Amhara, Ethiopia. Field experiment was conducted in hot spot areas of two locations using the material: two moderately resistant and one local (susceptible check) chickpea varieties with three commercially available seed-dressing fungicides (Apron Star, Noble, and Thiram). Treatments were arranged factorially in the RCB design with three replications. Results depicted that moderately resistant Mitk variety has significantly reduced disease pressure and gives better yield as compared to Arerti and local chickpea varieties. Even the disease pressure of fusarium wilt was lower in the Mitk variety followed by Arerti, and hence, its incidence and area under the disease progress curve reveal 6.23% and 292.1%-day, which was far apart by 17% and 873%-day, respectively, from Arerti. In case of the local chickpea variety, it was highly infected and its seed yield (0.4 t/ha) was lowered almost by half from the Mitk variety. Despite seed-dressing fungicides showed insignificant difference in both incidence and area under the disease progress curve, Thiram seed-dressing fungicides followed by apron star on Mitk variety indicates reasonable yield increment in both locations. Hence, integration of Mitk chickpea variety with the corresponding Thiram seed-dressing fungicides followed by Apron Star was advisable to manage fusarium wilt disease.

In order to explore synergistic phosphate fertilizer effects on soil nutrient and microbial in wheat (Triticum aestivum), four treatments were designed-CK: nitrogen fertilizer (containing N 306.14 kg/hm(2)), potassium fertilizer (containing K2O 116.67 kg/hm(2)), conventional phosphate fertilizer (containing P2O5 333.35 kg/hm(2)); T1: synergic phosphate fertilizer (containing P2O5 249.99 kg/hm(2)); T2: synergic phosphate fertilizer (containing P2O5 166.67 kg/hm(2)); and T3: synergic phosphate fertilizer (containing P2O5 83.32 kg/hm(2)). The application amount of nitrogen and potassium fertilizer in T1, T2, and T3 was the same as that in CK. The soil nutrient concentration of different treatments was analyzed, and the microbial diversity of different treatments was analyzed by Illumina MISEP high-throughput sequencing technology. The results showed that the T2 treatment performed the best. In 2020, the pH of T2 was 1.87% lower than that of CK, and the contents of alkali hydrolyzed nitrogen, available phosphorus, and available potassium were 5.8%, 11.44%, and 9.91% higher than CK, respectively. In 2021, the pH of T2 was 1.64% lower than that of CK, and the contents of alkali hydrolyzed nitrogen, available phosphorus, and available potassium were 1.06%, 7.89%, and 16.53% higher than CK, respectively. In addition, the application of synergistic phosphate fertilizer could improve the richness, diversity, and evenness of microorganisms in soil.

NaCl had an adverse effect on the germination and seedling performance of I. indigotica. However, these three priming agents alleviated salt stress by increasing the germination percentage, improving seed vigor, accelerating germination velocity, and establishing strong seedlings. The optimal concentrations were 15 g/L for CaCl2, 0.2 g/L for GA(3), and 40 mM for H2O2. Seed priming treatments enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes in seedlings, such as super-oxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT), under a salt environment, which reduced the oxidative injury caused by salt. Seed priming is a promising technique that can enhance the ability of I. indigotica seed germination when salt is present.																			0018-5345	2327-9834				MAY	2020	55	5					647	650		10.21273/HORTSCI14854-20	http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI14854-20													WOS:000531024500007

Herein, we assessed the changes in the SOC, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and soil erosion between 1980 and 2008 on China's Loess Plateau, a region that suffered severe soil erosion, prompting the implementation of the Grain for Green project in 1999 to reduce soil erosion and rehabilitate degraded land. We established structural equation model and conducted Sobol sensitivity analysis to evaluate how soil erosion and the Grain for Green project-induced vegetation change altered the temporal patterns of SOC at the regional scale. We showed that SOC was not significantly changed, while the NDVI increased and the soil erosion decreased between 1980 and 2008. The Grain for Green project contributed 67% and 100% to the changes in the NDVI and soil loss, respectively. Additionally, changes in the NDVI and soil loss were negatively correlated and showed significant spatial variation. The change in SOC was negatively affected by soil erosion before the Grain for Green project but positively affected by the increased vegetation after the Grain for Green project. The positive effect of the Grain for Green project on SOC after 1999 offset the negative effect of erosion between 1980 and 1999. Additionally, the SOC change and its response to vegetation and erosion were closely affected by climate and clay content. These results suggest that the Grain for Green project eliminated the negative effect of soil erosion on SOC on China's Loess Plateau.

The case of landless people in rural Tigray	SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT												Communal land-based resources are an essential source of livelihood in the rural economy of Ethiopia. In particular, the dependence of the landless people on the direct use of communal natural resources for their livelihoods jeopardizes both the resources they depend on and economic opportunities. To overcome such challenges, conservation of communal natural resources through collective action while addressing the food security problem has been described as one of the most appropriate resource management approaches. Thus, this paper explores how the livelihood strategies of landless people influence their willingness to participate in the conservation of natural resources. The study was conducted in five administrative districts in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia. The findings of this paper are based on the cross-sectional data collected through structured questionnaires from 324 randomly selected landless households. This study extends the previous analyses by introducing a new method of analytical tool, particularly in modeling rural people's willingness to participate in conservation. The results of ordered probit regression show that a higher level of willingness to conserve natural resources is observed if the household has access to farmland and harness resources generated in protected lands but with no access to artisanal mining and quarries. The study hence concludes that granting landless rural people access to farming activities and allowing them to reap economic benefits generated in protected lands promotes their participation in the conservation of natural resources.																			2765-8511					DEC 31	2023	9	1							2277559	10.1080/27658511.2023.2277559	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/27658511.2023.2277559													WOS:001099667100001

The soil physical and chemical properties, community structure, and composition of soil bacteria and fungi in the 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm soil layers, and winter wheat yield were analyzed. The results showed that, compared with DP, NT and ST significantly increased soil moisture content (SWC), soil organic carbon (SOC) content, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contents in 0-20 cm soil layer (p < 0.05), and significantly increased soil microbial community Shannon and Simpson index in 0-40 cm soil layer (p < 0.05). Compared with NT, ST and DP significantly increased SWC and SOC contents in 20-40 cm soil layer (p < 0.05). Actinobacteria and Ascomycota were the most abundant bacteria and fungi in the soil of the experimental site. Redundancy analysis further showed that soil physicochemical properties (SWC, SOC, DOC, and DON) were closely related to the microbial community. PICRUSt2 prediction results showed that DP increased the metabolic functional diversity of bacteria and fungi. ST and DP significantly increased the yield of winter wheat, and DP had the best effect. In conclusion, subsoiling tillage and deep plowing were beneficial to the accumulation and utilization of natural precipitation and the improvement of soil microbial community structure. Deep plowing was beneficial to the decomposition and metabolism of straw and organic fertilizer, and improved the catabolic ability of microbial community, thus increasing the yield of winter wheat.

However, the physiological and biochemical characteristics of dormancy release are still unclear. For our study, dormant G. littoralis seeds were subjected to cold stratification (4 degrees C). Physiological and biochemical characteristics, including germination percentage, the activities of antioxidant enzymes and alpha-amylase, and soluble sugar, soluble protein, H2O2, malondialdehyde (MDA) and coumarin were determined in imbibed seeds after different stratification periods (0, 30, 60, 90 or 120 days). The morphophysiological dormancy in G. littoralis seeds was completely released by cold stratification for 120 days. The activities of catalase (CAT) and content of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and total soluble sugars were significantly increased, while coumarins was significantly decreased during dormancy release. Dormancy release was significantly positively correlated with CAT activity (r = 0.903) and accumulation of H2O2 (r = 0.985) and total soluble sugars (r = 0.952), and significantly negatively correlated with coumarins (r = -0.919). Thus, the increase in H2O2, soluble sugars level and CAT activity and decrease in coumarins during cold stratification might contribute to promoting dormancy release in G. littoralis seeds.																			0251-0952	1819-5717				APR	2021	49	1					19	24		10.15258/sst.2021.49.1.03	http://dx.doi.org/10.15258/sst.2021.49.1.03													WOS:000653234800003
J	Tan, YY; Bello, MM; Raman, AAA				Tan, Yan Ying; Bello, Mustapha Mohammed; Raman, Abdul Aziz Abdul			Towards cleaner production in palm oil industry: Advanced treatment of biologically-treated POME using palm kernel shell-based adsorbent	CLEANER ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY												Palm oil processing generates enormous amount of wastewater, the palm oil mill effluent (POME), containing various recalcitrant pollutants. The biological processes commonly employed to treat POME often fail to achieve treatment levels required for safe disposal or recycling of the effluent, prompting the need to develop polishing technologies. In this work, we investigated the possibility of polishing biologically-treated POME using palm kernel shell activated carbon (PKSAC) derived from a solid waste generated during palm oil processing. The rationale is to provide impetus towards adopting cleaner production in the palm oil industry through recycling both wastewater and solid wastes generated from palm oil processing. The PKSAC was impregnated with iron oxide to produce a magnetic adsorbent that could be easily separated after the treatment. The adsorbent was characterized using BET, SEM/EDX, FTIR and VSM analyses. The adsorbent exhibited high specific surface area (611.85 m(2)/g), excellent magnetic property (15.16 emu/g) and various surface functional groups. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted to investigate the suitability of the adsorbent to polish biologically-treated POME. To investigate the effect of operational parameters (initial pH, adsorbent dosage and contact time) on the adsorption, response surface methodology using Box-Behnken Design was employed. Under the optimum condition (initial pH = 3.5, adsorbent dosage = 9.9 g/L and contact time = 3.4 h), 99.7% of the initial color and 85.0% of the initial COD were removed. The initial pH and adsorbent dosage are the most significant parameters affecting the adsorption. The adsorbent maintained excellent adsorption performance over 4 cycles, with the removal efficiency reducing by less than 2% after the 4th cycle. This study has shown that palm kernel shell can be used as an effective adsorbent for POME polishing, indicating a potential for wastes recycling within the palm oil industry. The use of palm kernel shell to treat POME, which could be subsequently recycled, represents a significant step towards enhancing the sustainability of palm oil industry.

Fine Resolution Sensor (FRS-1) data (spatial resolution of 3 m) and Medium Resolution ScanSAR (MRS) data (spatial resolution of 25 m) acquired from circular and dual polarised microwave data were used for the retrieval of soil moisture and to identify the best polarisation suitable for the study area. The evaluation was carried out during 2016-17. FRS-1 data was more accurate than MRS data for the extraction of soil moisture in the study area. Circular and dual-Polarisation retrieved soil moisture values were compared with volumetric soil moisture values for assessing the better polarisation. Dual polarisation and the incident angle between 15-20 degrees with R-2=0.952 perfonned better as compared to circular polarisation with more or less than 20 degrees' incident angle. A correction factor of -0.723 was derived and applied to FRS-1 data with less than a 20-degree incident angle for getting real soil moisture values on the spatio-temporal basis to optimize the management of natural ecosystems under climate change threat.					, Pushpanjali/P-6350-2018	, Pushpanjali/0000-0002-3213-2839													0019-5022	2394-3319				DEC	2021	91	12					1753	1757		10.56093/ijas.v91i12.120799	http://dx.doi.org/10.56093/ijas.v91i12.120799													WOS:000897355100011

We use the multinomial logit model to analyze the data and investigate factors affecting farmers' choices of whether to sell to local consumers market, cooperative unions, hotels/restaurants, or milk processing plants. The results show that households' number of milking cows, household size, and the relative price of milk increase farmers' likelihood of choosing the milk processing plant channels compared to local milk consumers. Access to information, dairy farming experience, cooperative membership, and market information increase farmers' probability to choose cooperative market outlets while access to dairy extension services and modes of payment affect farmers' choices of hotel/restaurant channel. These findings imply that creating better extension services and information can improve farmers' awareness and the need to increase market efficiency through farmers' development capability to organize and access to updated information and better marketing channels.																			0146-9428	1745-4557				AUG 30	2023	2023								5684470	10.1155/2023/5684470	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2023/5684470													WOS:001065207200003

The aim of this study was to assess the determinant factors of climate change adaptation choices in the agro-pastoral dry lands of northeastern Ethiopia. Data on the household characteristics and adaptation choices were collected using interview schedule from a sample of 260 household heads. Multivariate probit regression and descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. The results indicated that 63.5% of farmers were applying portfolio diversification, enhancing livestock productivity, agro-ecological practices, and diversifying non-agricultural income choices to acclimatize the climate change. The model revealed that many explanatory variables, such as educational level, gender, farming experience, family size, farmland size, goat flock size, farm and non-farm income, frequency of extension contact, access to credit and climate information were significant factors for adaption choice decisions. The marginal success probability of adapting non-agricultural income diversification was the lowest compared to the agro-ecological practices, portfolio diversification and enhancing livestock productivity. The marginal success probability of jointly adapting agro-ecological practices, portfolio diversification, non-agricultural income diversification and enhancing livestock productivity choices was also lower comparing to their failure. Therefore, any effort projected to relax climate change effects should gear towards the provision of services resembling to eminence extension, vocational trainings, affordable credit, empowering vulnerable groups, community radios as well as local meteorology. Moreover, non-farm income generating initiatives on top of agricultural intensification through input supply would expedite context specific adaptation to the changing climatic status quo.

To achieve this, a better understanding of the genetic basis of drought tolerance is necessary. Our study aimed to identify genomic regions associated with drought tolerance-related traits by phenotyping a mapping population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) for two seasons under well-watered (WW) and water-deficit (WD) conditions. We also used single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping through genotyping-by-sequencing to map these regions and attempted to identify candidate genes responsible for the observed phenotypic variation. Phenotyping of the RILs population revealed significant variability in most of the traits, with normal frequency distributions, indicating their polygenic nature. We generated a linkage map using 1,241 polymorphic SNPs distributed over 10 chromosomes (chrs), covering a total genetic distance of 5,471.55 cM. We identified 27 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with various morphophysiological and yield-related traits, with 13 QTLs identified under WW conditions and 12 under WD conditions. We found one common major QTL (qCW2-1) for cob weight and a minor QTL (qCH1-1) for cob height that were consistently identified under both water regimes. We also detected one major and one minor QTL for the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) trait under WD conditions on chr 2, bin 2.10. Furthermore, we identified one major QTL (qCH1-2) and one minor QTL (qCH1-1) on chr 1 that were located at different genomic positions to those identified in earlier studies. We found co-localized QTLs for stomatal conductance and grain yield on chr 6 (qg(s)6-2 and qGY6-1), while co-localized QTLs for stomatal conductance and transpiration rate were identified on chr 7 (qg(s)7-1 and qTR7-1). We also attempted to identify the candidate genes responsible for the observed phenotypic variation; our analysis revealed that the major candidate genes associated with QTLs detected under water deficit conditions were related to growth and development, senescence, abscisic acid (ABA) signaling, signal transduction, and transporter activity in stress tolerance. The QTL regions identified in this study may be useful in designing markers that can be utilized in marker-assisted selection breeding. In addition, the putative candidate genes can be isolated and functionally characterized so that their role in imparting drought tolerance can be more fully understood.																			1664-462X					MAY 8	2023	14								1124619	10.3389/fpls.2023.1124619	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2023.1124619								37223807					WOS:000991543000001
J	Vidiella, B; Sardanyés, J; Solé, R				Vidiella, Blai; Sardanyes, Josep; Sole, Ricard, V			Synthetic soil crusts against green-desert transitions: a spatial model	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE												Semiarid ecosystems are threatened by global warming due to longer dehydration times and increasing soil degradation. Mounting evidence indicates that, given the current trends, drylands are likely to expand and possibly experience catastrophic shifts from vegetated to desert states. Here, we explore a recent suggestion based on the concept of ecosystem terraformation, where a synthetic organism is used to counterbalance some of the nonlinear effects causing the presence of such tipping points. Using an explicit spatial model incorporating facilitation and considering a simplification of states found in semiarid ecosystems including vegetation, fertile and desert soil, we investigate how engineered microorganisms can shape the fate of these ecosystems. Specifically, two different, but complementary, terraformation strategies are proposed: Cooperation-based: C-terraformation; and Dispersion-based: D-terraformation. The first strategy involves the use of soil synthetic microorganisms to introduce cooperative loops (facilitation) with the vegetation. The second one involves the introduction of engineered microorganisms improving their dispersal capacity, thus facilitating the transition from desert to fertile soil. We show that small modifications enhancing cooperative loops can effectively modify the aridity level of the critical transition found at increasing soil degradation rates, also identifying a stronger protection against soil degradation by using the D-terraformation strategy. The same results are found in a mean-field model providing insights into the transitions and dynamics tied to these terraformation strategies. The potential consequences and extensions of these models are discussed.

Climate change influences soil erosion and is critical for the planning and management of soil and water resources. This study aimed to assess the current and future climate change impact on soil loss rate for the near future (2011-2040), middle future (2041-2070), and far future (2071-2100) periods relative to the reference period (1989-2018) in the Agewmariam watershed, Northern Ethiopia. The 20 models of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 global climate models (GCMs) under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 (intermediate scenario) and 8.5 (high emissions scenario) scenarios were used for climate projection. The statistical bias correction method was used to downscale GCMs. Universal Soil Loss Equation integrated with geographic information system was used to estimate soil loss. The results showed that the current average annual soil loss rate and the annual total soil loss on the study area were found to be 25 t ha(-1) year(-1) and 51 403.13 tons, respectively. The soil loss has increased by 3.0%, 4.7%, and 5.2% under RCP 4.5 scenarios and 6.0%, 9.52%, and 14.32% under RCP 8.5 scenarios in the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s, respectively, from the current soil loss rate. Thus, the soil loss rate is expected to increase on all future periods (the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s) under both scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) due to the higher erosive power of the future intense rainfall. Thus, climate change will exacerbate the existing soil erosion problem and would need for vigorous new conservation policies and investments to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on soil loss.																			1178-6221					FEB	2021	14								1178622121995847	10.1177/1178622121995847	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1178622121995847													WOS:000624965200001

Skill Gap Analysis is important to make the Extensionists updated and competent in their field. A Skill Gap Analysis using Borich Need Assessment Model was carried out in the four zones of Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) during 2016. The zones of ICAR-KVK were selected using simple random sampling. Twenty KVK from each zone were selected randomly and 3 Extensionists from each KVK were selected by using simple random sampling technique. The total sample size was 240. Mean weighted discrepancy score (MWDS) was used to study the skill gap. The result of the study indicated that the highest level of skill gap were expressed in designing and conducting farmers training, assessing training needs of the farmers, their ability to use computer (internet) and power point presentation, knowledge and awareness to approaches towards adult education and their ability to prepare visual aids to help deliver information. Lowest mean weighted discrepancy score was given to their ability in presenting the seminar and coordinating work with their peer. Inadequate funding emerged as the major barrier in acquiring the required competencies. Attention should be given to skill gap analysis owing to the importance given to skill development at the national level. Extensionists with the required skill in their job will lead to the better performance and ultimately better services to farmers.																			0019-5022	2394-3319				FEB	2020	90	2					268	272																WOS:000520159800004

Comparison of the Sentinel-2A satellite data of pre and post infestation periods revealed reduction in Leaf Area Index (LAI) in the infested fields. Groundtruth data confirmed that FAW infestation reduced LAI by 49.7%, biomass by 32.5% and grain yield by 51.8%. Infestation at Panicle Initiation (PI) stage caused maximum yield loss compared to flag leaf visible and boot stages. The interaction results showed FAW infestation at different crop stages had significant effect on biomass and yield, but not on LAI. Regression analysis with spectral vegetation indices revealed LAI (R-2: 0.82) and NDVI (R-2: 0.80) were significantly superior in identifying FAW infestation from the satellite data. This study demonstrates feasibility of site specific pest management and prevents further spread of the invasive FAW.																			1010-6049	1752-0762				AUG 10	2022	37	13					3801	3816		10.1080/10106049.2020.1869330	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2020.1869330		DEC 2020											WOS:000605390600001

To fill the knowledge gap about the role of autotrophic microbes in organic matter accumulation in degraded soil, the microbial CO2 fixation rate was estimated in nondegraded, lightly degraded, and severely degraded soils using C-13 stable isotope tracing technique. The influences of soil physical properties, nutrient contents, and autotrophic bacterial community on the microbial CO2 fixation capacity were investigated using a structural equation model. The results showed that soil degradation significantly reduced the autotrophic bacterial abundance. However, a higher species diversity and a more complex cooccurrence network of autotrophic bacterial taxa were observed in the lightly degraded soil than in the nondegraded and severely degraded soils. Interestingly, the microbial CO2 fixation rates in the lightly and severely degraded soils were 2.15- and 1.52-times higher than those in the nondegraded soil, respectively. The annual organic carbon fixed by autotrophic microbes exceeded 2.05% of the total organic carbon in the degraded soil, suggesting that autotrophic microbes play a vital role in organic matter accumulation in degraded soil. The structural equation model showed that soil nutrients other than the autotrophic bacterial community are the key factor affecting the microbial CO2 fixation capacity. The negative effect of soil nutrients on the CO2 fixation capacity indicates that autotrophic microbes exert a more important function at the initial stage of the restoration of degraded soil.

Researchers at the ICAR-Indian Institute of Rice Research have conducted a more comprehensive evaluation of SRI methods over six years (six wet and six dry seasons), comparing them with three alternatives: modified, partially mechanized SRI (MSRI) to reduce labor requirements; direct-seeded rice (DSR) as an alternative method for growing rice; and conventional transplanting of rice with flooding of fields (CTF). Grain yield with SRI methods was found to be about 50% higher than with CTF (6.35 t ha-1 vs. 4.27 t ha-1), while the MSRI yield was essentially the same (6.34 t ha-1), 16% more than with DSR (5.45 t ha-1). Water productivity with SRI methods was 5.32-6.85 kg ha-mm-1, followed by 4.14-5.72 kg ha-mm-1 for MSRI, 5.06-5.11 kg ha-mm-1 for DSR, and 3.52-4.56 kg ha-mm-1 for CTF. In comparison with CTF, SRI methods significantly enhanced soil microbial populations over time: bacteria by 12%, fungi by 8%, and actinomycetes by 20%. Biological activity in the rhizosphere was also higher as indicated by 8.5% greater dehydrogenase and 16% more FDA enzymes in soil under SRI management. Similarly, an indicator of soil organic matter, glucosidase activity, was 78% higher compared to CTF. SRI enhanced the relative abundance of beneficial microbial-feeding nematodes by 7.5% compared to CTF, while that of plant-pathogenic nematodes was 7.5% lower under SRI. Relative to conventional methods, SRI management reduced GHG emissions by 21%, while DSR reduced them by 23%, and MSRI by 13%, compared to standard rice-growing practice. Economic analysis showed both gross and net economic returns to be higher with SRI than with the other management systems evaluated. While the six-year study documented many advantages of SRI crop management, it also showed that MSRI is a promising adaptation that provides similar benefits but with lower labor requirements.

Water stress was applied at flowering stage of the crop and various morpho-physiological and biochemical characters were analyzed under control and water stress conditions. The genotypes, water levels and their interaction varied significantly for majority of the traits quantified revealing the presence of substantial genetic diversity. Based on these studies, genotypes PGRU95016, COBG05, IPU99209, IPU941 and IPU243 were identified as tolerant to drought stress conditions. Photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, total chlorophyll, proline content and peroxidase activity could be useful to screen for drought tolerance in black gram.					maddi, vanaja/AAR-4264-2020; Sarkar, Basudeb/AAK-2855-2021	Sarkar, Basudeb/0000-0003-3695-8061													0137-5881	1861-1664				MAR	2019	41	3							42	10.1007/s11738-019-2833-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-019-2833-x													WOS:000460726400001

Temperature-based phenology model for predicting the present and future establishment and distribution of recently invasive Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) in India	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) is a polyphagous and highly destructive invasive insect pest of many crops. It was recently introduced into India and widely reported in almost all parts of India. Development of a temperature-based phenology model for predicting its rate of development and distribution will help in understanding the establishment and further spread of introduced invasive insect pests. Development, survival and reproduction parameters of S. frugiperda at six constant temperature conditions (15, 20, 25, 27, 30 and 35 degrees C) were investigated and further validated with data generated under fluctuating temperature conditions. The estimated lower developmental threshold temperatures were 12.1 degrees C for eggs, 11 degrees C for larvae, 12.2 degrees C for pupae, 15.13 degrees C for males and 12.66 degrees C for females. Degree-day (DD) requirements for the development of the different stages of S. frugiperda were 50, 250 and 200 DD for egg, larva and pupa, respectively. The best-fitted functions were compiled for each life stage to yield a phenology model, which was stochastically simulated to estimate the life table parameters. The developed phenology model predicted temperature ranges between 27 and 30 degrees C as favourable for S. frugiperda development, survival and reproduction. The results revealed that maximum net reproductive rate (215.66 females/female/generation) and total fecundity (981.08 individuals/female/generation) were attained at 30 degrees C constant temperature. The mean length of generations decreased from 74.29 days at 15 degrees C to 38.74 days at 30 degrees C. The maximum intrinsic rate of increase (0.138 females/female/day) and shortest doubling time (4.9 days) were also observed at 30 degrees C. Results of simulated life table parameters showed high temperature-dependent development of S. frugiperda and complete development within all the tested constant temperature ranges (15-35 degrees C). Simulated life table parameters for predicting risk indices of S. frugiperda in India indicated a significant increase in activity indices and establishment risk indices with a higher number of generations during future (2050 and 2070) climatic change scenarios compared to present conditions. Our results indicate that India will be highly suitable for the establishment and survival of S. frugiperda in future time periods.

Variability among Ethiopian durum wheat genotypes grown under different climatic conditions of Tigray for some agronomic and grain-quality traits	JOURNAL OF CROP IMPROVEMENT												The lack of adaptable varieties is the major problem for durum wheat (Triticum turgidumvar.durum) production in Ethiopia. The variability in 36 durum wheat genotypes was studied for key traits across locations to select genotypes possessing optimal grain quality and high grain yield for production in northern Ethiopia, using a simple lattice design. Variation attributable to genotypes (G), locations (L) and G x L interaction was significant for the studied traits (p < 0.001). Mean grain protein content (GPC) among genotypes ranged from 9.4% to 12.9%. Genotypes 208312 (G17) and 208168 (G22) had mean GPC of 12.9% and 12.8%, respectively. Grain with high GPC (12.7%-21.3%) was harvested from Beati-Maymesanu (BMM), a terminal drought-affected location, whereas the lowest GPC range (5.5%-10.5%) was recorded at Agarba. This implied that water stress during the reproductive growth stage of durum wheat could increase GPC. Similarly, high gluten index (GI) (68%-95%) was obtained at BMM, whereas the frequency of genotypes with low GI (<60%) was high (n = 14) at Agarba. Genotypes with higher GPC and GI tended to have lower grain yield (GY). This negative association constrains breeding efforts to combine high GY with high GPC and GI. However, some genotypes, mainly farmers' varieties (FVs), had combined high GY with the modest value of GPC and GI. FVs SSD2, 248478, 222426, and 208873 and the improved varietiesAsassaand Quamy were suitable as parents for making crosses to generate new genotypes with high GY, GPC, and GI.

J	Yang, M; Dong, CW; Shi, Y				Yang, Min; Dong, Chengwu; Shi, Yan			Nano fertilizer synergist effects on nitrogen utilization and related gene expression in wheat	BMC PLANT BIOLOGY												The application of nano materials is one of the current hot spots in agricultural production. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of different nano fertilizer synergists on nitrogen (N) utilization and related gene expression in wheat. The experiments were carried out in pot and field conditions at the West-Coast Economic New Area experimental base and Greenhouse of Qingdao Agricultural University. Seven treatments were set up: CK (compound fertilizer), T1 (compound fertilizer + 0.3% nano carbon synergist), T2 (compound fertilizer + 0.3% nano calcium carbonate synergist), T3 (compound fertilizer + 0.3% composite nano synergist), T4 (70% compound fertilizer + 0.3% nano carbon synergist), T5 (70% compound fertilizer + 0.3% nano calcium carbonate synergist), T6 (70% compound fertilizer + 0.3% composite nano synergist). The results showed that compared with CK, the N accumulation of T1, T2, T3, T4, T5 and T6 increased by 40-50%, 30-40%, 55-65%, 20-30%, 15-20% and 30-40%, respectively; and the N use efficiency increased by 12-19%, 9-18%, 16-22%, 5-17%, 4-16% and 10-20% respectively. And the gene expression levels of TaNRT2.2, TaNRT2.3, TaGS1 and TaGS2 in the treatments with synergistic phosphate fertilizer were significantly higher than those in the CK. The application of nano fertilizer synergist can significantly improve N accumulation, N use efficiency, and promote the expression of genes related to N transport and metabolism.																			1471-2229					JAN 12	2023	23	1							26	10.1186/s12870-023-04046-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-023-04046-9								36631773					WOS:000919414500004

San01 promotes growth performance and induces salinity and drought tolerance in sweet potato (<i>Ipomoea batatas</i> L.)	JOURNAL OF PLANT INTERACTIONS												Endophytic plant-growth-promoting bacteria help plants to cope with severe environmental stresses. A Klebsiella sp. strain San01 isolated from sweet potato roots exhibited diverse plant-growth-promoting activities, including indole acetic acid production, ammonia production, and phosphate solubilization. San01 inoculation significantly increased the growth characteristics of sweet potato. Moreover, the sweet potato inoculated with San01 resulted in the alleviation of drought and salinity stresses. In comparison with the non-inoculated plants, the wilting symptom and the inhibition of photochemical response were significantly diminished in San01-inoculated plants under stress conditions. In the presence of San01, the enhancement of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging ability and elevated activities of ascorbate peroxidase and superoxide dismutase were observed to combat the oxidative stress in sweet potato. Further investigation showed that the San01 inoculation enhanced the expression of the IbLEA gene in sweet potato under salinity and drought. These results confer a promising biotechnological approach through San01 interaction to develop stress-tolerant sweet potato plants.

This can be one of the contributing factors underlying an increase in heat strokes. We examined the impact of summer minimum air temperatures, which often represent nighttime temperatures, as well as a maximum temperature on a heat stroke. We collected data from the records of daily ambulance transports for heat strokes and meteorological data for July and August of 2017-2019 in the Tottori Prefecture, Japan. A time-stratified case-crossover design was used to determine the association of maximum/minimum air temperatures and the incidence of heat strokes. We used a logistic regression to identify factors associated with the severity of heat strokes. A total of 1108 cases were identified with 373 (33.7%) calls originating in the home (of these, 59.8% were the age of >= 75). A total of 65.8% of cases under the age of 18 were related to exercise. Days with a minimum temperature >= 25 degrees C had an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 3.77 (2.19, 6.51) for the incidence of an exercise-related heat stroke (reference: days with a minimum temperature < 23 degrees C). The odds ratio for a heat stroke occurring at home or for calls for an ambulance to the home was 6.75 (4.47, 10.20). The severity of the heat stroke was associated with older age but not with air temperature. Minimum and maximum air temperatures may be associated with the incidence of heat strokes and in particular the former with non-exertional heat strokes.

MGW9 improves the salt tolerance of maize during seed germination	AMB EXPRESS												Crop performance is seriously affected by high salt concentrations in soils. To develop improved seed pre-sowing treatment technologies, it is crucial to improve the salt tolerance of seed germination. Here, we isolated and identified the strain Bacillus sp. MGW9 and developed the seed biostimulant MGW9. The effects of seed biopriming with the seed biostimulant MGW9 in maize (Zea mays L.) under saline conditions were studied. The results show that the strain Bacillus sp. MGW9 has characteristics such as salt tolerance, nitrogen fixation, phosphorus dissolution, and indole-3-acetic acid production. Seed biopriming with the seed biostimulant MGW9 enhanced the performance of maize during seed germination under salinity stress, improving the germination energy, germination percentage, shoot/seedling length, primary root length, shoot/seedling fresh weight, shoot/seedling dry weight, root fresh weight and root dry weight. Seed biostimulant MGW9 biopriming also alleviated the salinity damage to maize by improving the relative water content, chlorophyll content, proline content, soluble sugar content, root activity, and activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase, while decreasing the malondialdehyde content. In particular, the field seedling emergence of maize seeds in saline-alkali soil can be improved by biopriming with the seed biostimulant MGW9. Therefore, maize seed biopriming with the seed biostimulant MGW9 could be an effective approach to overcoming the inhibitory effects of salinity stress and promoting seed germination and seedling growth.					li, heqin/AAN-9429-2020	Jiang, Xuwen/0000-0003-3537-9631													2191-0855					MAY 25	2021	11	1							74	10.1186/s13568-021-01237-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13568-021-01237-1								34032933					WOS:000657730900003

The brown midrib (bmr) trait is known for its association with a reduced lignin content and increased digestibility. Pearl millet inbreds having the bmr trait were derived from two populations ICMV bmr and WRajPop bmr via continued selfing up to 6-8 generations. The results from the crosses revealed the presence of the same single recessive gene that controlled the bmr in both the populations. The stable expression of the bmr gene in the new genetic background indicated that there was no effect of modifier genes. Four inbreds were identified with the stable expression of bmr (three in ICMV 155 and one in the WRajPop background) with a high biomass potential, which can serve as a bmr source in future pearl millet forage breeding programmes.																			1212-1975	1805-9325					2023	59	3					176	187		10.17221/93/2022-CJGPB	http://dx.doi.org/10.17221/93/2022-CJGPB		APR 2023											WOS:000975104400001

In wheat, they can be assessed to determine environmental adaptability. Methods The selected spring wheat was investigated in a field experiment conducted from 2015 to 2017 in a semiarid area. The three treatments were (1) plastic-soil mulching (PMS), (2) gravel mulching (SM), and (3) without mulching (CK). The soil chemical properties and the net photosynthetic rate in flag leaves were recorded; the stoichiometric parameters of soil and flag leaves were calculated. Results The soil organic carbon (C) of PMS increased significantly in the 0-30-cm profile when compared with SM and CK, respectively. The soil nitrogen (N)/phosphorus (P) ratio of PMS increased in the filling stage when compared with SM and CK, respectively. The C/N ratio in flag leaves of wheat under PMS significantly decreased and increased compared with SM and CK at the filling stage during a wet year, respectively, and significantly decreased compared with CK during a drought year. The C/N and C/P ratios were significantly correlated between soil and wheat flag leaves in SM, and the net photosynthetic rates and the C/N, C/P, and N/P ratios of flag leaves under PMS and SM were also significantly correlated. Conclusions The PMS treatment relieved soil nutrient limitations in flag leaves and increased the net photosynthetic rate by optimizing foliar C/N, C/P, and N/P ratios. This resulted in increased photosynthesis under drought conditions and significantly increased the yield and water-use efficiency.																			1439-0108	1614-7480				AUG	2020	20	8			SI		3158	3170		10.1007/s11368-020-02659-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-020-02659-3		MAY 2020											WOS:000531142600001

There are several justifications for re-thinking for the sustainable use of crop biodiversity in our breeding programs. Thirty-one durum wheat farmers' varieties (FVs), together with five improved check varieties, were characterized in Tigray during 2014 and 2015 main cropping seasons. The genotype effect explained most of the variations in measured traits, which enabled us to identify superior and stable genotypes for wider adaptation as well varieties with more local adaptation. The genotypes and test locations imposed a highly significant (P < 0.001) effect on both phenological and quantitative traits. A yield advantage of 14.3% was obtained from top performer FV over top performer improved variety, Asassa. Of the tested FVs, 27.8% were superior for grain yield (GY) than improved varieties and 19.4% of these superior FVs were more stable and adaptable than the improved varieties. Besides giving higher GY with spatial stability, they qualify for industrial requirements with high-grain protein (>13%) and gluten (>33%) contents. FVs such as G10, G16, G21, G22 and G30 have wider adaptability and are suitable for production in all tested areas. As outcome of this study, two superior FVs, G10 (208304) and G30 (8208), were nationally released for commercial production for their productivity, stability and grain quality. Utilizing the diverse durum wheat FVs can effectively improve productivity and adaptability. Wheat breeders need to revisit these resources to improve adaptation of wheat production to the changing climatic conditions.

This study attempts to effectively use pigeon pea stalk (PPS) for biochar production, a promising source as a soil amendment for carbon sequestration and alternative fuel source. PPS was pyrolyzed at different loads and reaction times to optimize the kiln temperature (350-400 degrees C and 450-500 degrees C) and changes in physicochemical properties, higher heating value (HHV) and yield were assessed. The results indicated that biochar yield, volatile matter, bulk density, O/C and H/C atomic ratios decreased, whereas fixed carbon, ash content and total porosity increased with increasing kiln temperature across all loads. Biochar produced at 450-500 degrees C (18 kg load kiln(-1)) had higher total carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, recovered total carbon and total nitrogen, total potential carbon and CO2 reduction potential. Biochar produced at 350-400 degrees C had the maximum cation exchange capability (43.0 cmol kg(-1)). Biochar has estimated O/C and H/C atomic ratios of 0.07-0.15 and 0.35-0.50, respectively. Biochar exhibited good agronomic characteristics and fulfilled key quality criteria of H/C < 0.7 and O/C < 0.4 for soil carbon sequestration, as described by the European Biochar Certificate and the International Biochar Initiative. The estimated mean residence time and the mass fraction of carbon that would remain after 100 years were consistently greater than 1000 years and 80%, respectively. The biochar produced at 450-500 degrees C (at 18.0 kg kiln(-1)) from PPS had higher fixed carbon (65.3%), energy density (1.51), energetic retention efficiency (53%), fuel ratio (4.88), and HHV (25.01 MJ kg(-1)), as well as lower H/C and O/C ratios, implying that it is suitable for use as an alternative solid fuel.

In the present study, hydropriming was optimised for vigour enhancement in aged ultra-dry wheat seeds. Wheat seeds (initially dried to 5.0% moisture content) stored at ambient temperature for ten years were humidified over water for seven days, then soaked for 12, 24 and 36 hours in aerated distilled water (seed priming treatment). Primed and unprimed seeds were equilibrated at ambient conditions for 48 hours. Changes in germination traits, activities of anti-oxidative enzymes, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA), alpha-amylase activity, soluble protein and soluble sugars were determined. Results indicated that hydropriming for 12 hours significantly increased the germination percentage, from 50.7 to 58.6%. The increase in germination was significantly positively correlated with catalase activity (r = 0.969), and significantly negatively correlated with accumulation of H2O2 (r = 1.000).																			0251-0952	1819-5717				APR	2020	48	1					57	63		10.15258/sst.2020.48.1.08	http://dx.doi.org/10.15258/sst.2020.48.1.08													WOS:000524504300008

A meta-analysis was conducted to determine how organic fertilization (i.e., livestock manure) affects yield, yield variability and water use efficiency (WUE) of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in northern China, and how this is impacted by N management and growing environment. Organic fertilization significantly increased grain yield and WUE by an average of 18 and 20 % compared to without organic fertilizer, respectively, and also reduced spatial and temporal yield variability. Compared to without organic fertilizer, change in grain yield was + 24, + 28, and -11 % for treatments of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer plus organic fertilizer with the same level of synthetic nitrogen (NOF), decreased level of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer combined with organic fertilizer (NROF), and a portion of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer replaced with organic nitrogen fertilizer at the same level of nitrogen (NROF), respectively. The positive effect of organic fertilizer on grain yield and WUE of winter wheat was greatest when yield levels was < 4.0 Mg ha(-1). Moreover, organic fertilization was most effective at improving grain yield and WUE in North China Plain when synthetic N application was < 150 kg N ha(-1) and in growing environments with SOM < 1.4 % and ET < 500 mm. These results demonstrate that applying organic fertilizer in combination with a decreased level of synthetic N fertilizer is an effective approach for advancing sustainable intensification of winter wheat in northern China, and that greatest benefits with organic fertilization may occur when local environmental factors (e.g., growing region and soil conditions) are appropriately considered.					li, li/GPX-3938-2022; li, li/HII-4157-2022; Li, Li/AEM-3636-2022; Li, Donglin/JEF-4284-2023; LI, LI/GVS-5344-2022	Wang, Linlin/0000-0001-5981-8833; li, lin/0000-0002-8014-8296; deng, xi ping/0000-0003-4577-9217													0378-3774	1873-2283				FEB 28	2020	229								105934	10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105934	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105934													WOS:000525280400018

Ravindra			Interactive effects of temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> on efficacy of insecticides against <i>Spodoptera litura</i> Fab. in a global warming context	PHYTOPARASITICA												Influence of two dimensions of climate change i.e., elevated temperature (eTemp) and elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) on toxicity of insecticides against Spodoptera litura Fab. on peanut using CO2 Temperature Gradient Chambers (CTGC) facility was investigated. The insecticides viz., diamides (flubendiamide), avermectins (emamectin benzoate), organophosphates (quinalphos), spinosyns (spinosad) and synthetic pyrethroids (deltamethrin) were tested for their efficacy and persistence toxicity (PT) at eTemp and eCO(2). The twelve set conditions comprising of reference (28 +/- 0.5 degrees C; 380 ppm), eTemp (29, 30, 31, 32, 34 +/- 0.5 C-o with 380 ppm CO2), eCO(2) (28 +/- 0.5 C-o; 550 ppm) and eTemp+eCO(2) (29, 30, 31, 32, 34 +/- 0.5 (o)c with 550 ppm CO2) were maintained in CTGC. Interactive effects of eCO(2) and eTemp caused the higher LC50 values of spinosad and deltamethrin with negative temperature coefficients and showed the 'reduction of toxicity'. Lower LC50 values and positive temperature coefficients for flubendiamide (6.67), emamectin benzoate (7.38) and quinalphos (3.04) were recorded, indicating the 'higher toxicity' at interactive eCO(2) and eTemp. The order in PT of insecticides was deltamethrineTemp + eCO(2) conditions over reference. Present results indicate the negative impact of eTemp and eCO(2) on efficacy of spinosad and deltamethrin necessitating their higher requirement than was needed to achieve equal control at reference/ambient temperature and CO2.																			0334-2123	1876-7184				JUL	2021	49	3					417	431		10.1007/s12600-020-00854-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12600-020-00854-z		JAN 2021											WOS:000605854400003

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying plants' responses to T. purpurogenus under low-phosphorous (P) stress are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic changes in maize with low-P-sensitive (31778) and -tolerant (CCM454) genotypes under low-P stress and its symbiotic interaction with T. purpurogenus. Its colonization enhanced plant growth and facilitated P uptake, particularly in 31778. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that 135 DEGs from CCM454 and 389 from 31778 were identified, and that only 6 DEGs were common. This suggested that CCM454 and 31778 exhibited distinct molecular responses to T. purpurogenus inoculation. GO and KEGG analysis revealed that DEGs in 31778 were associated with nicotianamine biosynthesis, organic acid metabolic process, inorganic anion transport, biosynthesis of various secondary metabolites and nitrogen metabolism. In CCM454, DEGs were associated with anthocyanin biosynthesis, diterpenoid biosynthesis and metabolic process. After T. purpurogenus inoculation, the genes associated with phosphate transporter, phosphatase, peroxidase and high-affinity nitrate transporter were upregulated in 31778, whereas AP2-EREBP-transcription factors were detected at significantly higher levels in CCM454. This study provided insights on the molecular mechanisms underlying plant-endophytic fungus symbiosis and low-P stress in maize with low-P-sensitive and -tolerant genotypes.					wang, hao/JKH-5890-2023; WANG, Bin/JGM-2639-2023; luo, yuan/JLS-6416-2023; liu, huan/JKI-3764-2023; Wang, Minghao/JMD-0670-2023; Wang, Hao/ABB-8923-2020; wang, yixuan/JGM-3893-2023; WANG, HUI/JFA-9683-2023; wang, wenxin/JOZ-3291-2023; Li, jiaqi/JOZ-6395-2023; wang, hang/JND-8481-2023; LIU, HUI/JPX-8014-2023; Liu, yujing/JQI-7225-2023; li, wenjing/JMP-7498-2023; Chen, Xin/JDN-2017-2023; yang, rui/JHI-3328-2023	Wang, Hao/0000-0001-9109-6017; Zhang, Peiyu/0009-0002-2323-059X; zhao, zixuan/0009-0004-7004-2908													1661-6596	1422-0067				AUG	2023	24	15							11941	10.3390/ijms241511941	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms241511941								37569319					WOS:001045559900001

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi improve biomass, photosynthesis, and water use efficiency of <i>Opuntia ficus-indica</i> (L.) Miller under different water levels	JOURNAL OF ARID LAND												Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Miller is a CAM (crassulacean acid metabolism) plant with an extraordinary capacity to adapt to drought stress by its ability to fix atmospheric CO2 at nighttime, store a significant amount of water in cladodes, and reduce root growth. Plants that grow in moisture-stress conditions with thick and less fine root hairs have a strong symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to adapt to drought stress. Water stress can limit plant growth and biomass production, which can be rehabilitated by AMF association through improved physiological performance. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of AMF inoculations and variable soil water levels on the biomass, photosynthesis, and water use efficiency of the spiny and spineless O. ficus-indica. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse with a full factorial experiment using O. ficus-indica type (spiny or spineless), AMF (presence or absence), and four soil water available (SWA) treatments through seven replications. Water treatments applied were 0%-25% SWA (T1), 25%-50% SWA (T2), 50%-75% SWA (T3), and 75%-100% SWA (T4). Drought stress reduced biomass and cladode growth, while AMF colonization significantly increased the biomass production with significant changes in the physiological performance of O. ficus-indica. AMF presence significantly increased biomass of both O. ficus-indica plant types through improved growth, photosynthetic water use efficiency, and photosynthesis. The presence of spines on the surface of cladodes significantly reduced the rate of photosynthesis and photosynthetic water use efficiency. Net photosynthesis, photosynthetic water use efficiency, transpiration, and stomatal conductance rate significantly decreased with increased drought stress. Under drought stress, some planted mother cladodes with the absence of AMF have not established daughter cladodes, whereas AMF-inoculated mother cladodes fully established daughter cladodes. AMF root colonization significantly increased with the decrease of SWA. AMF caused an increase in biomass production, increased tolerance to drought stress, and improved photosynthesis and water use efficiency performance of O. ficus-indica. The potential of O. ficus-indica to adapt to drought stress is controlled by the morpho-physiological performance related to AMF association.																			1674-6767	2194-7783				AUG	2023	15	8					975	988		10.1007/s40333-023-0022-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-023-0022-7													WOS:001050712300006

The response of foxtail millet to drought stress is a complex regulatory network. It is of great guiding significance for agricultural production to continuously explore candidate genes of foxtail millet drought resistance and reveal the molecular regulatory mechanism and metabolic pathway of foxtail millet drought tolerance. This study investigated three different cultivars of foxtail millet with different drought resistance. Drought stress reduced the water and chlorophyll content, and increased the Malondialdehyde (MDA) level and soluble protein of foxtail millet leaves. From strong to weak, the drought resistance order was Jigu39, Jingu21, and Longgu16. The transcriptome analysis of these three cultivars was carried out. 2954, 1531, and 2344 deferentially expressed genes under drought stress were identified in Jigu39, Jingu21, and Longgu16. The GO and KEGG pathway analysis identified DEGs significantly enriched in photosynthesis, chlorophyll metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism in all three cultivars. In addition, we identified 46 genes whose trends of transcription change were consistent with the drought resistance trends among three cultivars of foxtail millet. Among them, 32 genes were first identified related to drought response in foxtail millet, which was worth further research.						zhang, ben/0000-0003-4473-9184													0167-6903	1573-5087				JAN	2023	99	1					45	64		10.1007/s10725-022-00875-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-022-00875-0		JUL 2022											WOS:000827344800001

Applying a versatile, comprehensive, attribute-based waterhole classification scheme to ecosystem-based management challenges	WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Context. Understanding habitat suitability for feral animals across a landscape is important for conservation planning because the spatial and temporal availability of water provides critical limits to native biodiversity and the processes that threaten it. Previous attempts to support management actions on feral pig populations through predictions of population abundance, distribution and seasonal resource constraints have been confounded by a lack of knowledge, classification and mapping of waterholes - which are critical to their survival. Aims. In this paper, we aimed to apply a waterhole classification scheme for feral pig management to address gaps in our understanding of water and food availability through space and time, at scales relevant to feral animal movement and resource use. Methods. We utilise an attribute-based waterhole classification scheme for ecosystem-based management by defining a waterhole typology of feral pig habitat suitability and applying it spatially. Key results. Five attributes (water permanence, predictability of inundation, oceanic influence, dominant vegetation and shading) reflect many of the critical requirements for feral pig habitat in northern Australia. The attributes directly relate to the environmental constraints that exert population and behavioural pressure on feral pigs. These attributes were applied spatially in a specific hierarchy to group waterholes into 21 types. Conclusions. A waterhole typology that characterises within the context of their suitability for feral pig populations is foundational for systematic adaptive management and monitoring programs that aim to reduce the impact of threatening processes on freshwater ecosystems. Implications. Refining the mapping of important feral pig habitat variables (water and food) will greatly improve modelling approaches that aim to support data-driven management approaches, such as connectivity analysis and estimating population dynamics to inform culling programs. Here we demonstrate a significant increase in overlap with known feral pig distributions using a much smaller mapped effective management area when compared with previous best available spatial products.

In cool and semiarid rain-fed areas, however, the effect on carbon sequestration in soil and the soil-crop system is not clear. In this study, a crop rotation field experiment was carried out on the Loess Plateau, China, involving (1) wheat continuous cropping (WCC), (2) maize continuous cropping (MCC), (3) potato continuous cropping (PCC) and (4) wheat-maize-potato rotating cropping (RC). All treatments were tilled once, and then, plastic mulched immediately to inhibit evaporation. We found that the rotating cropping system improved water storage in the 0-300 cm soil profile by 65.8 mm through the 6 years, while MCC depleted deep soil moisture. In a drought year, total dry matter (DM) for the rotating cropping was greater by 23.9% and 79.3% and harvested carbon quantity (HCQ) by 0.6 and 1.8 Mg ha(-)(1) compared with WCC and MCC systems, respectively. Total evapotranspiration significantly decreased by 14.5% compared with MCC, with no significant change compared with WCC and PCC. The soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration at 20-30 cm depth in the rotating cropping system was 36.0%, 28.0% and 30.3% greater than those of WCC, MCC and PCC, respectively. Similarly, the SOC sequestration rate at this depth was higher by 3.8, 3.2 and 3.4 Mg ha(-)(1), respectively. The pure carbon accumulation (PCA) of the rotating cropping system significantly increased compared with WCC and PCC, resulting in increased water use efficiency of pure carbon accumulation (WCP) by 11.1, 2.2 and 3.1 Mg ha(-)(1) mm(-)(1) compared with the WCC, MCC and PCC systems, respectively. Overall, the rotating cropping (RC) system maintained better soil water conditions, sustained crop development and SOC sequestration, especially optimizing the relationship between crop water utilization and SOC sequestration in soil-crop system in the cool semiarid rain-fed area.						yin, jia de/0000-0001-9317-0356													0266-0032	1475-2743				APR	2023	39	2					717	728		10.1111/sum.12873	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sum.12873		JAN 2023											WOS:000906416600001

Continuous soybean cropping could cause soil quality deterioration and plant growth inhibition. However, the effects of continuous wheat/soybean cropping on soybean rhizosphere microbes remain largely unknown. In this study, we compared the soybean yield and rhizosphere soil microbial community between continuous winter wheat/summer soybean (W/S) with two harvests in one year and winter wheat/summer soybean-winter wheat/summer maize (W/S-W/M) with four harvests in two years. The results showed that the soybean yield in the W/S group significantly (p < 0.05) declined within the first two years. The W/S-W/M showed higher soybean yield and soil fertility index than the W/S group. The sequencing results revealed that cropping rotation had a higher impact on the fungal community than the bacterial community. The W/S group showed 22.08-23.01% higher alpha diversity of the fungal community, but the alpha diversity of the bacterial group did not vary significantly in this group. The fungal community composition in the W/S and W/S-W/M groups differed significantly. In the W/S-W/M group, a higher relative abundance of plant growth-promoting fungi (e.g., Mortierella), nematophagous fungi (e.g., Plectosphaerella), and biological control fungi (e.g., Coniothyrium) was observed. In the W/S group, a higher relative abundance of lignocellulose-degrading fungi (e.g., Trechispora, Myceliophthora, Botryotrichum, and Coniochaeta) and pathogenic fungi (e.g., Pyrenochaetopsis and Cyphellophora) was observed. LEfSe analysis demonstrated that Mortierella, Myceliophthora, and Trechispora could serve as crucial biomarkers. Mortierella was positively associated with available P levels and negatively associated with NO3--N levels and pH while Trechispora showed the opposite trend. The findings of this study could enhance the current understanding of the mechanisms associated with the continuous wheat/soybean cropping obstacles and ensure the sustainability of agricultural production.

This study is aimed at investigating total titrable acidity and organic acids of fruit wines produced by response surface optimization of cactus pear and Lantana camara fruits blend and cactus pear fruit alone. The predictive mathematical model of the blended fruit wine is well fitted (R-2 = 0.9618 and absolute average deviation (AAD) = 2.06%). The optimum values of fermentation temperature, inoculum concentration, and Lantana camara fruitjuice concentration to produce predictive total titrable acidity of 0.8% (w/v citric acid) were 24 degrees C, 10% (v/v), and 10.7% (v/v), respectively. The blended fruit wine was with lower total titrable acidity (w/v citric acid) of 0.83 +/- 0.058% compared to wine produced from cactus pear fruit alone 1.06 +/- 0.27%. The high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of both produced wines revealed the difference in concentration of citric (+/- 3.35 mg/ml), L-tartaric (+/- 3.71 mg/ml), and L-ascorbic acid (+/- 0.07 mg/ml). Citric acid was predominant organic acid in both fruit wines, and its content in the cactus pear is 7.09 +/- 0.07 mg/ml and blended fruit wine 4.74 +/- 0.07 mg/ml.

Through two continuous wheat season field experiments, yield related traits under traditional surface irrigation (border irrigation) and three drip fertilization frequencies (DF2, DF3, DF4, that was, topdressing water and fertilizer twice, three or four times in the same way during the growth period) of three wheat cultivars (Jimai 22, Jimai 20, Shiluan 02-1) were studied. Increasing the frequency of drip irrigation fertilization could prolong the time of high-level photosynthesis, increase the dry matter distribution amount (DMDA) of stems and leaves, and add the weight of 1000 grains; it could increase the DMDA and nitrogen distribution amount (NDA) of the stems, leaves, and grains of Jimai 22, forming higher harvest index (HI) and nitrogen harvest index (NHI), but could reduce the DMDA of the grains of Jimai 20 and Shiluan 02-1, increasing NDA, reducing the harvest index but forming a higher nitrogen harvest index. The increase in drip irrigation fertilization frequency can improve protein content, increase grain number per spike, decrease spike number, improve the yield of medium gluten wheat, and improve nitrogen partial productivity and water use efficiency, while strong gluten wheat has a decrease in yield, nitrogen partial productivity, and water use efficiency. In summary, medium gluten wheat is more suitable for higher fertilization frequency in the Huang-Huai-Hai wheat region, while strong gluten wheat is the opposite.

Thereafter, comprehensive study was conducted to enhance the Zn density in grain using three cultivars (CSR 30, Pusa Basmati-6 and PusaSugandh 5) selected from the preliminary study, using three diverse soil types ((Inceptisols of IARI, New Delhi; Inceptisols of farmer's field, Karnal; and Alfisols of CRIDA, Hyderabad) and six zinc nutrient management treatments including control. The results in the preliminary study indicated that the Zn content in rice grain (after hulling) varied from 13.3 to 22.5 mg kg(-1) with mean of 18.8 mg kg(-1), while Fe content varied from 8.3 to 14.3 mg kg(-1) with mean of 10.7 mg kg(-1). In the comprehensive study, the highest Zn content in grain (21.2 mg kg(-1)) and straw (33.2 mg kg(-1)) was observed in CSR-30 Cultivar. Among the soil types, Alfisols of CRIDA, Hyderabad maintained significantly highest Zn content in grains and straw. Among the Zn containing nutrient management treatments, application of 5 mg Zn kg(-1) (basal) + foliar spray of 0.5% ZnSO4 (bi-weekly) maintained significantly highest Zn content in grain (21.9 mg kg(-1)) and straw (41.3 mg kg(-1)). Further, based on the assumption that when an individual consumes rice @ 200 g day(-1), his daily dietary intake of Zn would be 3.53 mg day(-1) in control (without Zn application) as compared to 4.38 mg day(-1) with the rice grown with soil and foliage application of Zn.

The relative importance of these factors may change during the litter decomposition, however, very few studies have emphasized the temporal dynamics of these factors across plantation ecosystem, which limits our understanding of litter decomposition. To evaluate the temporal dynamic of above-mentioned litter decomposition drivers, we collected leaf and fine root litters from four different years of restoration of Robinia pseudoacacia on the Loess plateau of China and placed them on soil from the corresponding sites to incubate for 210 days. We constructed successive litter decomposition stages according to litter mass-loss interval, and we also used partial least squares path modelling (PLSPM) to evaluate the relative importance of these drivers. Our results showed that the C and N losses in leaf litter were significantly higher than those in root litter regardless of stand age. Leaf litter C and N losses increased with restoration duration, while root litter C and N showed an opposing trend with restoration duration, with the lowest levels of losses occurring at older stand ages. The initial litter quality, litter quality and the soil environment regulated leaf and root litter C loss, and enzyme activity also determined root C loss. Litter quality, the soil environment and enzyme activity influence leaf litter N loss, while root N loss was controlled by initial litter quality and the soil environment. Overall, enzyme activities had a relatively weak influence on litter C and N losses, and they impacted litter C and N losses only during the early stages. Therefore, our results revealed substantial differences in different restoration durations and litter types at the different decomposition stages, which has important significance for understanding carbon and nitrogen cycling on the Loess Plateau of China.

Here, we present data of 5 years field experimentation on a rotational strip peanut/cotton intercropping system to uncover its beneficial effects on crop production and decipher the underlying mechanisms. Treatments included monoculture of peanut (MP), monoculture of cotton (MC), peanut/cotton intercropping (IC), and peanut/cotton intercropping with solid root barrier (SC). Averaged for 5 years, intercropping did not alter the peanut pods yield whereas the seed cotton yield was significantly increased by 52.63% compared with monoculture. Moreover, the net economic return of IC was significantly increased by 59.49%. Physiological data indicated that the leaf net photosynthetic rate, total biomass, and the accumulation of total nitrogen in peanut pods and cotton buds were significantly increased in IC compared with MP and MC. Meanwhile, the contents of total protein and oleic acid in peanut kernels were also increased by intercropping. Metabolomics evidence showed that differential metabolites from "Tryptophan" and "Carbon" pathways were significantly enriched in peanut and cotton strips of IC. Additionally, IC significantly altered the rhizosphere soil bacterial abundance composition and diversity, and the metabolic functional features of "carbohydrate" and "amino acid" were significantly enriched. Strikingly, the beneficial effects of intercropping were partially counteracted by SC as indicated by the reduction of crop production and net return. Our results demonstrated that rotational strip peanut/cotton intercropping increases production, net economic returns, and peanut quality parameters via the interspecific interactions by enhancing plant growth, regulating root exudates, and modulating soil microbial communities.

Study on the monitoring and classification of winter wheat freezing injury in spring based on 3S technology	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE												Frequent freezing injury greatly influences winter wheat production; thus, effective prevention and a command of agricultural production are vital. The freezing injury monitoring method integrated with '3S' (geographic information systems (GIS), global positioning system (GPS) and remote sensing (RS)) technology has an unparalleled advantage. Using HuanJing (HJ)-1A/1B satellite images of a winter wheat field in Shanxi Province, China plus a field survey, crop types and winter wheat planting area were identified through repeated visual interpretations of image information and spatial analyses conducted in GIS. Six vegetation indices were extracted from processed HJ-1A/1B satellite images to determine whether the winter wheat suffered from freezing injury and its degree of severity and recovery, using change vector analysis (CVA), the freeze injury representative vegetation index and the combination of the two methods, respectively. Accuracy of the freezing damage classification results was verified by determining the impact of freezing damage on yield and quantitative analysis. The CVA and the change of normalized difference vegetation index (Delta NDVI) monitoring results were different so a comprehensive analysis of the combination of CVA and Delta NDVI was performed. The area with serious freezing injury covered 0.9% of the total study area, followed by the area of no freezing injury (3.5%), moderate freezing injury (10.2%) and light freezing injury (85.4%). Of the moderate and serious freezing injury areas, 0.2% did not recover; 1.2% of the no freezing injury and light freezing injury areas showed optimal recovery, 15.6% of the light freezing injury and moderate freezing injury areas showed poor recovery, and the remaining areas exhibited general recovery.					xu, li/GNH-3667-2022	Zhigang, Wang/0000-0002-3290-4675; Feng, Meichen/0000-0002-0338-7963													0021-8596	1469-5146				NOV	2021	159	9-10					623	635	PII S0021859621001076	10.1017/S0021859621001076	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0021859621001076		MAR 2022											WOS:000767131100001

By using permeable (100 mu m) and impermeable (solid) root barriers in a multi-site field experiment, we aimed to study the impact of root-root interactions on nutrient accumulation, soil microbial communities, crop yield, and economic returns in a peanut/cotton IC system under non-saline, secondary-saline, and coastal saline soil conditions of China. Results The results indicate that IC decreased the peanut pods yield by 14.00, 10.01, and 16.52% while increased the seed cotton yield by 61.99, 66.00, and 58.51%, respectively in three experimental positions, and consequently enhanced the economic returns by compared with monoculture of peanut (MP) and cotton (MC). The higher accumulations of nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) were also observed in IC not only in the soil but also in vegetative tissues and reproductive organs of peanut. Bacterial community structure analysis under normal growth conditions reveals that IC dramatically altered the soil bacterial abundance composition in both peanut and cotton strips of the top soil whereas the bacterial diversity was barely affected compared with MP and MC. At blossom-needling stage, the metabolic functional features of the bacterial communities such as fatty acid biosynthesis, lipoic acid metabolism, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and biosynthesis of ansamycins were significantly enriched in MP compared with other treatments. Conversely, these metabolic functional features were dramatically depleted in MP while significantly enriched in IC at podding stage. Permeable root barrier treatments (NC-P and NC-C) counteracted the benefits of IC and the side effects were more pronounced in impermeable treatments (SC-P and SC-C). Conclusion Peanut/cotton intercropping increases crop yield as well as economic returns under non-saline, secondary-saline, and coastal saline soil conditions probably by modulating the soil bacterial abundance composition and accelerating plant nutrients accumulation.

Determining appropriate interventions to mainstream nutritious orphan crops into African food systems	GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY-AGRICULTURE POLICY ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT												Nutritious ?orphan? crops could (re)diversify African food systems, but appropriate means to bring this about are required. A review of the literature on crop intervention options suggested success and failure factors in promotion, but indicated little about the relative importance of production-versus consumption-based measures and how these interact. An analysis of secondary crop production data indicated that addressing food policies could be valuable for orphan crop mainstreaming, but, as with literature review, did not provide clear guidance on the importance of different interventions. A survey of experts suggested that cross-disciplinary teams are important for developing mainstreaming strategies, but revealed no clear consensus on the importance of particular measures for specific orphan crops. We discuss the implications of these findings.

Foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv) can respond to abiotic stress through a highly complex polygene regulatory network, in which the SiCYP450 family is also involved. Although the CYP450 superfamily has been systematically studied in a few species, the research on the CYP450 superfamily in foxtail millet has not been completed. In this study, three hundred and thirty-one SiCYP450 genes were identified in the foxtail millet genome by bioinformatics methods, which were divided into four groups, including forty-six subgroups. One hundred and sixteen genes were distributed in thirty-three tandem duplicated gene clusters. Chromosome mapping showed that SiCYP450 was distributed on seven chromosomes. In the SiCYP450 family of foxtail millet, 20 conserved motifs were identified. Cis-acting elements in the promoter region of SiCYP450 genes showed that hormone response elements were found in all SiCYP450 genes. Of the three hundred and thirty-one SiCYP450 genes, nine genes were colinear with the Arabidopsis thaliana genes. Two hundred SiCYP450 genes were colinear with the Setaria viridis genes, including two hundred and forty-five gene duplication events. The expression profiles of SiCYP450 genes in different organs and developmental stages showed that SiCYP450 was preferentially expressed in specific tissues, and many tissue-specific genes were identified, such as SiCYP75B6, SiCYP96A7, SiCYP71A55, SiCYP71A61, and SiCYP71A62 in the root, SiCYP78A1 and SiCYP94D9 in leaves, and SiCYP78A6 in the ear. The RT-PCR data showed that SiCYP450 could respond to abiotic stresses, ABA, and herbicides in foxtail millet. Among them, the expression levels of SiCYP709B4, SiCYP71A11, SiCYP71A14, SiCYP78A1, SiCYP94C3, and SiCYP94C4 were significantly increased under the treatment of mesotrione, florasulam, nicosulfuron, fluroxypyr, and sethoxydim, indicating that the same gene might respond to multiple herbicides. The results of this study will help reveal the biological functions of the SiCYP450 family in development regulation and stress response and provide a basis for molecular breeding of foxtail millet.

In this research, four-year field experiments with twelve winter wheat varieties were conducted during the winter wheat-growing seasons between 2016 and 2020 in order to: (1) screen high- and stable-yielding winter wheat varieties under rainfed conditions, (2) investigate the mechanism of high-yielding wheat yield formation and the relationships among grain-yield formation traits, and (3) investigate the nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUtE) of high-yielding wheat. The results showed that high-yield level wheat varieties (HL; Yannong999, Taimai1918 and Yannong173) obtained a higher average grain yield than medium-yield level wheat varieties (ML) and low-yield level wheat varieties (LL) by 10.1% and 29.0%, respectively. Compared with ML and LL, HL had a higher biomass at anthesis, higher spike dry matter at anthesis, higher spike partitioning index and fruiting efficiency (grain set per unit of spike dry weight at anthesis), and the highest grain number per square meter (24.2 x 10(3) m(-2)). Simultaneously, HL maintained a higher leaf area index (LAI) at anthesis and a higher net photosynthesis rate (Pn) of flag leaves after anthesis, which contributed to a higher post-anthesis biomass; HL also had higher maturity biomass, harvest index (HI), and biomass remobilization in comparison to ML and LL. The above results demonstrated that HL improved grain yield by increasing grain number per square meter, post-anthesis biomass, biomass remobilization, maturity biomass, and HI. Additionally, HL also obtained higher NUtE by improving grain yield. Therefore, screening winter wheat varieties with traits such as HL can help achieve high and stable yields and high NUtE under rainfed conditions.																				2073-4395				MAR	2023	13	3							915	10.3390/agronomy13030915	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13030915													WOS:000952821400001

Plastic film mulching affects field water balance components, grain yield, and water productivity of rainfed maize in the Loess Plateau, China: A synthetic analysis of multi-site observations	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Plastic film mulching (PM) has been widely practiced for rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) in the Loess Plateau, China. However, controversy remains regarding its impacts on field water balance components. There is also scant quantitative information on water-limited potential grain yield (GYw) and water productivity (WPw). A meta analysis and boundary line analysis were conducted using 1421 paired observations extracted from 83 peer reviewed publications to (1) assess PM-induced changes in soil water storage at planting (SWSP), evapotranspiration (ET), and soil water storage at harvest (SWSH), and (2) quantify GYw and WPw in PM fields. PM significantly increased SWSP by 4.0% on average due to an 83.2% average increase in precipitation storage during the fallow season. Overall, ET showed a significant positive response to PM (+2.9%), resulting in 56.4% more soil water depletion than no-mulching (NM) fields over the growing season. However, SWSH significantly increased by an average 1.8% after applying PM, indicating that increased storage of fallow season precipitation replenished increased depletion of growing season soil water. Averaged across all samples, PM had significant positive effects on GY (+56.1%) and WP (+47.5%), which were attributed to higher transpiration, ratio of transpiration to ET, and harvest index from the perspective of effective crop water use. Based on GY and WP boundary lines, GYw and WPw under NM were estimated to be 10,728 kg ha(-1) and 26.8 kg ha(-1) mm-1 on average, respectively, and the respective averages under PM were 13,702 kg ha(-1) and 34.8 kg ha(-1) mm(-1). The GY and WP gaps (i.e., differences between actual and potential values) averaged around 3300 kg ha(-1) and 7.0 kg ha(-1) mm(-1), respectively, in NM and PM fields. In the GY versus ET and WP versus ET scatter plots, the vertical distances between the measured data points on a specific field and the corresponding boundary line indicated field-specific gaps for GY and WP. This study increases our understanding of the effect sizes of PM on field water balance components and the benchmarks of GY and WP for rainfed maize in the Chinese Loess Plateau and other regions with similar conditions worldwide.

Eighteen transect lines with 632 meters apart from each other were established from top to bottom. A total of 115 main plots for all communities with 20 x 20 m, were established along transect lines from the upper part of the forest to the river's edge. To collect data on seedlings and saplings, 5 m x 5 m and 10 m x 10 m subplots were laid respectively within the main sampling plots. For each plot the plant species were counted, diameter at breast height and height of trees and shrubs were measured. The human disturbance data were visually estimated for each plot in each community. Plant community classification was made following Ethiopia agro-ecological zones. Plant species diversity and richness were found related to human disturbance and altitude. A total of 108 species belonging to 99 genera and 57 families were identified. The results revealed that Asteraceae was the most diverse higher plant family with nine species (8.3%) followed by Fabaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and Rosaceae with six (5.5%) species each. The overall Shannon diversity and evenness index of the forest were 4.02 and 0.86 respectively. Tree/shrub, sapling and seedling densities were 664.4, 757.2 and 805.7 individual's ha(-1) respectively. The total basal area of the forest was 55.99 m(2)ha(-1). About 25.7% of the importance values index was contributed by four species, Juniperus procera, Podocarpus falcatus, flex mitts, and Erica arborea. The similarity in species composition within the forest was low, indicating that the different parts of the forest had different floras.

In this study, we explored the effects of various long-term different fertilization treatments (manure, M; chemical fertilizer, NP; manure + chemical fertilizer, MNP; and no fertilizer, CK) on bacterial community structure and soil sucrase, urease, and alkaline phosphatase activities in Shaping, Hequ, China. High-throughput sequencing was used to amplify the third to the fourth hypervariable region of the 16S ribosomal RNA for analysis of the bacterial community structure. Enzyme activities were determined by colorimetry. Soil treated with MNP had the highest bacterial Abundance-based Coverage Estimator index and enzyme activities. The principal coordinates analysis results showed significant differences among the various fertilization treatments (p < 0.001). Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Chloroflexi were consistently dominant in all soil samples. The redundancy analysis and Monte Carlo permutation tests showed that the soil bacterial communities were significantly correlated with alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen, organic matter, urease, and alkaline phosphatase.

The occurrence of climate change in the region was first evaluated for the base period (1992-2018) using two nonparametric tests of Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope estimator. Then, the climatic parameters of maximum temperature, minimum temperature and precipitation were simulated under RCP4.5 scenario for the period 2019-2039 based on downscaled output data of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) using LARS WG software. The growth period was obtained using a linear multiple regression model, which was selected based on R-square and accounted for 87% of its total variation. The results predicted that the average annual temperature will increase by 2 degrees C, while the average annual precipitation will increase by 30% by the end of 2039. Planting dates were determined based on two indices combining temperature and precipitation for the base and future periods. The results showed that climate change effects at the 2039 horizon will shorten by 18 days the wheat growth period and the appropriate planting time for rainfed wheat will be reduced by 2-19 days.

In this experiment, ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography was used to determine the residues of diflufenican in wheat plants, grains, and soil, which provided a new theoretical basis and technical guidance for the safe production of wheat. RESULTS The results showed that the average diflufenican recovery per added level in wheat and soil were in the range of 85.7% to 91.3%, relative standard deviations were all in a range of 2.43% to 6.00%, and the minimum detectable amount of diflufenican was 1.0 x 10(-10) g kg(-1). With the increase of wheat growing days and soil layers, the residues of diflufenican in wheat plants and soil became lower. The order of residual amount of diflufenican in the growth period were heading period, flowering period, filling period and maturing period. The order of residual amount of diflufenican in different soil layers was 0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80 and 80-100 cm respectively from the top to the bottom. In addition, with the increase of the dosage of diflufenican, the residual amount of diflufenican becomes higher. Thus, the residual amount of diflufenican after 2.0 times applied amount was higher than the 1.0 time applied amount. CONCLUSION The residual amounts of diflufenican in wheat and soil were very small, far below the value of the maximum residue limit (MRL) on wheat provided by China. Under the applied amount administered in this experiment, a single spray of diflufenican in wheat trifoliate is safe for wheat, humans and livestock.

The objectives of this study were to examine the production of defensive phytohormones and perform a comparative transcriptome analysis between two yam cultivars with different resistance levels againstBotrytis cinereainoculation. After inoculation withB. cinerea, the endogenous ethylene level was found to have accumulated to a higher level in the MH1 resistant cultivar. Meanwhile, expression profiles identified differential defense regulation of ethylene pathway in MH1 (versus susceptible cv. MH3) in response toB. cinerea. A number of ethylene-synthesis and -responsive genes were expressed at higher levels in MH1 than in MH3 after inoculation. Furthermore, ethylene supplementation in MH3 plants by ethephon spraying indeed enhanced the resistance againstB. cinereaandColletotrichum alatae, and elevated the expression ofDaEIN2andDaERF96. Our work improves understanding of defense mechanism and highlights the function of ethylene potentially utilized for yam protection against diseases.

Brown earth (BE) is one of the main soil types in China, and the specific soil-forming conditions make it high risk of nutrient leaching. Determining the soil fertility of BE and optimal N application rates for main crops' production is important to reduce nitrogen leaching. Based on China's second national soil survey, the basic fertility level of BE was defined, and the effects of four N management methods [one-time base fertilizer (BF), topdressing (TF), combined organic fertilizer (OF) and controlled-release fertilizer (CF)] on maize and wheat yield and N efficiency were analysed. The study found that except for lower phosphorus content (level 4), the soil fertility of BE was at a moderate level (level 3). Compared with no N application, these four N management methods significantly increased the maize and wheat yield and showed the trend of OF > CF > TF > BF; TF, CF and OF significantly increased the N efficiency comparison with BF. The optimal N application rates for wheat and maize were 129-174 kg ha(-1) and 170-235 kg ha(-1), respectively, when considering the win-win of yield and N efficiency. N fertilizer reduction in BE needs to be further strengthened, and the specific N application rates to achieve profit maximization should be adjusted depending on environmental factors.					wang, jing/GRS-7509-2022; wang, jian/GVS-0711-2022; wang, jian/HRB-9588-2023; Wang, Jing/IQW-3496-2023; wu, jun/ISB-8607-2023; Jiang, Yalin/ITV-2565-2023	Wang, Jing/0000-0002-8296-2961; xiaoxia, zou/0000-0002-1087-6167													0266-0032	1475-2743				JUL	2022	38	3					1416	1429		10.1111/sum.12791	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sum.12791		MAR 2022											WOS:000769581900001

Independent and interactive effects of <i>e</i>CO<sub>2</sub> and <i>e</i>Temp. on <i>Spodoptera frugiperda</i> (J E Smith) on Maize-A major input for prediction of future pest scenario	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS												Climate change is now unequivocal and influences crops and the incidence of insect pests. Understanding the spatially variable, species-specific, and complex effects of climate change is essential in developing an appropriate pest management strategy. The two dimensions of climate change i.e., elevated temperature (eTemp.) and elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) influence insect herbivores. In the present study, the growth and development of an invasive insect pest, fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J E Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) on maize at eCO(2) and eTemp conditions using CO2 and temperature Gradient Chambers (CTGC) was estimated. Dilution of bio-chemical constituents was noted with lower leaf nitrogen (9%-14%), higher carbon (3%-11%), higher C : N (18%-26%), and higher tannins (13%) in maize foliage at eCO(2)+eTemp levels. A significant influence on primary parameters of insect viz., higher total consumption by larvae (38%), extended larval duration (13%) with increased larval weights (17%), and differential pupal weights (14%) in successive generations was recorded at eCO(2) + eTemp compared to ambient. Their effect was continued on various insect performance indices also, with higher relative consumption rate, RCR (40%), lower relative growth rate, RGR (11%), and varied approximate digestibility (AD), the efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI) and digested food (ECD) of S frugiperda larvae. The interactive effect of eCO(2) and eTemp led to a higher Potential Population Increase Index (PPII) (19%) due to higher fecund adults. The effect of eCO(2) offsets the impact of eTemp when interacting together on some of the insect parameters. The present results indicate that eCO(2) and eTemp play a key role in influencing the growth and development of S frugiperda indicating higher pest incidence in future climate change periods.

J	Sebnie, W; Adgo, E; Kendie, H				Sebnie, Workat; Adgo, Enyew; Kendie, Hailu			Characterization and Classification of Soils of Zamra Irrigation Scheme, Northeastern Ethiopia	AIR SOIL AND WATER RESEARCH												Understanding soil types of a given area is an important prerequisite to design optimum management strategies such as irrigation water management. The study was thus conducted on characterization and classification of Zamra irrigation scheme in Abergelle district of Amhara Region, which has an area of 196.16 ha. For this study, 53 auger observations, four profile pits, extensive visual observations, reconnaissance survey, and descriptions of soil profiles and laboratory analysis were used to study the morphological and physicochemical properties of the soils of the scheme. Twelve disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected from all profiles of each genetic horizon for laboratory analysis. The soils of the study area were identified based on Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations/World Reference Base for Soil Resources (FAO/WRB) 2015. The results revealed that the textural classes of all profiles of the study site ranged from sandy clay loam to sandy loam. The chemical properties of the soil in terms of total nitrogen, organic matter, and available phosphorus were in the very low and low categories as per the criteria developed by Tekalign and Olsen, respectively, whereas exchangeable bases (Ca, Mg, K, and Na), cation exchange capacity, and extractable micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu) were medium to high. Based on morphological, physical, and chemical analyses, the soils were classified as Leptic Regosols (Eutric, Loamic; 21.99% of the area), Vertic Cambisols (Hypereutric; 17.87%), Haplic Regosols (Eutric; 36.69%), and Rhodic Nitisols (Eutric; 23.44%). Therefore, management techniques that enhance soil fertility (including crop rotations, manuring, fallow periods, proper management of crop residues, and leguminous cover crops) and water-saving technologies suitable to the terrain of the area are the best options to enhance land productivity in the area.

We aimed to investigate its role in altering the roots and alleviating P deficiency in the adzuki bean Vigna angularis. Methods The adzuki bean variety "Jin No. 5" was pre-cultivated in sand. Fourteen-day-old seedlings were sprayed twice with 0.4 mM LaCl3 solution. Next, we treated the seedlings with half-strength Hoagland solution containing P reduced to 1% of its original concentration (P-deficient); P reduced to 5% of the original (P-marginal); and unadjusted solution (P-sufficient). We measured plant growth, root structure, root hydraulic conductivity, P content, gas exchange, and photosynthetic pigment levels in all groups. Results LaCl3 application significantly increased leaf P concentration, effectively improving the P uptake efficiency of roots, shoots, and leaves under severe P stress. Root morphology and acid phosphatase (APase) activity varied significantly in response to LaCl3 under low-P stress. A greater leaf area, gas exchange ability, chlorophyll content, and carotenoid content were observed in the presence of LaCl3 under P-marginal stress. Conclusions The application of LaCl3 can promote growth and P acquisition in adzuki beans under P limitation by inducing changes in root morphology, APase activity, and hydraulic conductivity.																			0032-079X	1573-5036				SEP	2019	442	1-2					385	399		10.1007/s11104-019-04197-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-019-04197-5													WOS:000485324700027
J	Teka, K				Teka, Kassa			The role of local earthworms in plant nutrient addition in the Ethiopian Drylands	SCIENTIA AGRICOLA												The Ethiopian Drylands are rich in their variety of local earthworm species. However, the category of species, and the effect of their performance on additions to plant nutrients have not been adequately evaluated. Thus, local earthworm samples were collected from the three major agroecological zones (highland, midland, and lowland) in Tigray (northern Ethiopia) and classified down to species level. Moreover, a vermicomposting experiment with four treatments (three local earthworm species, Eisenia fetida, and a conventional composting method) and three replications was established. Finally, each bin's mature compost sample was taken to analyze plant nutrient content. The study results indicated that earthworm species in the highland, midland and lowland agroecological zones were Dendrobaena veneta, Eisenia andrie and Lumbricus rubellus, respectively. The use of these earthworms in the composting process (average of the four earthworm species) yielded higher nutrient content, ranging from 21.9 % for Sodium to 3300 % for Boron, compared to the conventional one. The highest total nitrogen (an increase of 44.4 %) and organic carbon (an increase of 33.4 %) were recorded in the Eisenia fetida and Dendrobaena veneta treated bins, respectively. Composting with Eisenia andrie has resulted in increases in P (96.1 %), K (125 %), Mg (83 %) and all micro-nutrients (between 91 % for Zn and 4400 % for B). Both Eisenia andrie and Lumbricus rubellus species contributed to the increased additions of Sulfur (85.7 %) compared to the control. It can be concluded that the use of local earthworms (particularly Eisenia andrie) in the composting process plays a significant role in plant nutrient addition.																			1678-992X						2023	80								e20220139	10.1590/1678-992X-2022-0139	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1678-992X-2022-0139													WOS:000994465500001

It was also demonstrated that SO activity is essential to cope with rising dark-induced endogenous sulfite levels and maintain optimal carbon and sulfur metabolism in tomato plants exposed to extended dark stress. The response of SO and sulfite reductase to direct exposure of low and high levels of sulfate and carbon was rarely shown. By employing Arabidopsis wild-type, sulfite reductase, and SO-modulated plants supplied with excess or limited carbon or sulfur supply, the current study demonstrates the important role of SO in carbon and sulfur metabolism. Application of low and excess sucrose, or sulfate levels, led to lower biomass accumulation rates, followed by enhanced sulfite accumulation in SO impaired mutant compared with wild-type. SO-impairment resulted in the channeling of sulfite to the sulfate reduction pathway, resulting in an overflow of organic S accumulation. In addition, sulfite enhancement was followed by oxidative stress contributing as well to the lower biomass accumulation in SO-modulated plants. These results indicate that the role of SO is not limited to protection against elevated sulfite toxicity but to maintaining optimal carbon and sulfur metabolism in Arabidopsis plants.

The objective of this trial was to identify stable and high yielding field pea genotype for production in Eastern Amhara. The trial was conducted using randomized complete block design with three replications. Combined analysis of variance for grain yield revealed that genotypes, environments, and genotype by environment interaction effect were highly significant (P <= 0.01). The environments, GEI, and genotypes were accounted for 77.47%, 13.83%, and 4.37%, of the total sum squares, respectively, indicating that field pea grain yield was significantly affected by the changes in the environment, followed by GEI and genotypic effect. The candidate genotype, EH-03-002, showed 14.42% and 44.87% yield advantage over the standard and local checks, respectively.

J	Mao, SL; Shangguan, ZP				Mao, Shenglin; Shangguan, Zhouping			Evolution of spatiotemporal patterns in vegetation net primary productivity and the driving forces on the Loess Plateau	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												In this study, we determined whether changes in vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) can be used to characterize the quality of terrestrial ecosystems, which is critical for global change and carbon balance. We first explored the spatial correlation of NPP and its impact on vegetation restoration. MOD17A3 remote sensing products were used to analyze the temporal and spatial changes in NPP on the Loess Plateau (LP) over the last two decades (2000-2020). The resulting spatial autocorrelation indices identified cold and hot spots in the spatial clustering patterns. The effects of climate change and human activities on the anomalous clustering of NPP were assessed using Pearson correlation analysis and multi-temporal land use land cover data. The results indicate that i) Temporally, from 2000 to 2020, the NPP of the LP increased significantly by 6.88 g Cm-2 yr(-1) and so did the proportion of revegetated land area >400 g Cm-2 yr(-1) from 4% to 37%. Spatially, NPP showed an increasing trend from northwest to southeast. ii) The vegetation NPP on the LP showed a strong positive global spatial autocorrelation (p< 0.01). The hot and cold regions were polarized; the cold spots were clustered in the northwest, while the hot spots in the south and east. The spatial clustering patterns were dominated by high-high (HH) and low-low (LL) clusters. Abnormal patterns existed mainly in the transition areas between HH and LL clusters and insignificant regions, which were jointly affected by human activities and climate change. iii) Precipitation was the dominant climatic factor (86%) affecting the NPP variation in the LP, with the annual minimum precipitation showing a significantly positive relationship with the interannual variability in NPP, while the maximum precipitations greatly influenced the variation in local spatial anomaly patterns. This suggests that climatic extremes affect vegetation. Our study helps to facilitate green ecological management and high-quality development in the LP.																				2296-665X				MAY 30	2023	11								1134917	10.3389/fenvs.2023.1134917	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1134917													WOS:001010609500001

Temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition due to shifts in soil extracellular enzymes after afforestation	GEODERMA												Afforestation of arable land has been proposed as one of the most effective strategies for climate change mitigation. However, the effects of afforestation on soil CO2 emissions have not been well investigated due to a lack of information on the capacity of carbon pools to sequester CO2 over the long term. In this study, we conducted a 414-day incubation experiment to monitor changes in CO2 emission, soil extracellular enzymes, and microbial biomass at soils collected from a site afforested with R. pseudoacacia L and an adjacent cropland system under 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C constant temperatures. The study was to reveal how soil organic carbon decomposed under different temperatures during incubation along an afforestation gradient. Our results showed that: 1) after warming, active pool respiration increased from 0.64% to 12.57%, passive pool respiration increased from 20.62% to 46.77%, and slow pool respiration decreased from 21.27% to 59.35% for cropland to afforested land; 2) active and slow carbon pool increased in young and middle-aged afforested lands while the passive carbon pool increased in the late stage; and 3) microbial biomass and enzyme activities affected the respiration rate and the fraction of respiration during warming, especially enzyme affected active and slow pools. Our findings indicate that the temperature sensitivity of soil organic carbon decomposition changed mainly due to shifts of soil extracellular enzymes after afforestation, and provides insight into how SOC decomposition in afforested ecosystems may respond to future changes in climate.

Elucidating the molecular regulatory networks of stress tolerance is crucial for genetic enhancement of drought tolerance. Two genotypes of maize contrasting in their yield response to water deficit were evaluated for tolerance traits of water relations, net CO2 assimilation rate, antioxidative metabolism and grain yield in relation to the expression levels, based on transcription profiling of genes involved in stress signaling, protein processing and energy metabolism to identify functional tolerance mechanisms. In the genotype SNJ201126 upregulation of calcium mediated signaling, plasma membrane and tonoplast intrinsic proteins and the membrane associated transporters contributed to better maintenance of water relations as evident from the higher relative water content and stomatal conductance at seedling and anthesis stages coupled with robust photosynthetic capacity and antioxidative metabolism. Further the protein folding machinery consisting of calnexin/calreticulin (CNX/CRT) cycle was significantly upregulated only in SNJ201126. While the down regulation of genes involved in photosystems and the enzymes of carbon fixation led to the relative susceptibility of genotype HKI161 in terms of reduced net CO2 assimilation rate, biomass and grain yield. Our results provide new insight into intrinsic functional mechanisms related to tolerance in maize.

Here, the authors evaluate ideal distribution models of agricultural activities in the Punalu'u valley on O'ahu, Hawai'i, to assess how habitat suitability changed as a result of infrastructural investment and dynamic environmental, social and demographic change. The results are of relevance for contemporary initiatives to revive Indigenous agricultural systems in Hawai'i and beyond.

J	Agmon, D; Yizhaq, H				Agmon, David; Yizhaq, Hezi			From the discrete to the continuous brachistochrone: a tale of two proofs	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS												In a previous paper (2019 Eur. J. Phys. 40 035005) we showed how to design a discrete brachistochrone with an arbitrary number of segments. We have proved, numerically and graphically, that in the limit of a large number of segments, N >> 1, the discrete brachistochrone converges into the continuous brachistochrone, i.e. into a cycloid. Here we show this convergence analytically, in two different ways, based upon the results we obtained from investigating the characteristics of the discrete brachistochrone. We prove that at any arbitrary point, the sliding bead has the same velocity on both the continuous and discrete paths, and the radius of the curvature of both paths is the same at corresponding points. The proofs are based on the well-known fact that the curve of a cycloid is generated by a point attached to the circumference of a rolling wheel. We also show that the total acceleration magnitude of the bead along the cycloid is constant and equal to g, whereas the acceleration vector is directed toward the center of the wheel, and it rotates with a constant angular velocity.

Promotion of <i>Terminalia brownii</i> in reforestation by development of appropriate dormancy breaking and germination methods in drylands; Kenya	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Terminalia brownii Fresen in the Combretaceae family, is one of the indigenous tree species used in agroforestry, afforestation and reforestation programmes in drylands of Kenya. It is widely distributed in the semi-arid lands of East, Central and West Africa. It is an important drought tolerant and multipurpose agroforestry species whose potential is underutilized due to poor seed germination. Its products such as timbers, posts, charcoal and curving wood among others are not available in required quantities for domestic and industrial use. Exploitation of T. brownii is on the increase, but efforts to promote its planting are thwarted by lack of seedlings attributed to poor seed germination. This study investigated dormancy and germination of T. brownii seeds. Mature T. brownii fruits were harvested from Ikanga, Mbumbuni, Kabururu and Kimose sites; in Kitui, Makueni, Tharaka Nithi and Baringo counties of Kenya respectively. Flowering and fruiting was monitored and mature fruits harvested for dormancy and germination tests. To conduct germination tests, one hundred fruits and extracted seeds were subjected to each of the following treatments: mature whole fruits (control), dewinged fruits, fruits nipped at the distal and proximal ends and extracted seeds in four replicates. Extracted seeds started germinating after incubation for 7 days, while fruits nipped at the distal end took 21 days. The control and all other treatments from all sites failed to germinate after an incubation period of 60 days. Extracted T. brownii seeds recorded the highest germination with the best at 76% from Ikanga, while those nipped at the distal ends recorded a mean germination of 13% across all sites. There is evidence suggesting that T. brownii fruits recorded poor germination due physiological seed dormancy probably imposed by the hard samara fruit. These findings suggest that T. brownii fruits from Kimose should be nipped at the distal end, while those from Eastern Kenya (Kitui and Makueni Counties) should be extracted completely by removing the seed from the fruit to enhance germination. These results will inform choice of propagation of T. brownii seeds and enhance its planting in various agroforestry practices and afforestation programmes. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Walp.] against bruchid [<i>Callosobruchus maculatus</i> (Fab.)] and correlation with physical and biochemical parameters of seed	PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES-CHARACTERIZATION AND UTILIZATION												The current study was undertaken to identify the sources of tolerance to bruchid in cowpea, by screening a set of germplasm accessions as a source for natural resistance. A total of 103 diverse accessions of cowpea were evaluated for resistance to Callosobruchus maculatus Fab. under no-choice artificial infestation conditions. Significant differences among the cowpea accessions were observed for oviposition, adult emergence, exit holes and per cent seed weight loss (PSWL) caused by the bruchid infestation. The accessions showed variation in physical seed parameters viz., colour, shape, testa texture, length, width and seed hardness. Among the seed biochemical parameters studied, per cent sugar content ranged from 0.322 (IC330950) to 1.493 (IC249137), and per cent phenol content ranged from 0.0326 (EC390261) to 1.081 (EC528423). Correlation studies indicated that PSWL had significant positive correlation (r = 0.335) with exit holes, oviposition (r = 0.219), adult emergence (r = 0.534) and seed roundness (r = 0.219). Adult emergence had a significant negative correlation with seed hardness (r = -0.332). Correlation with biochemical parameters indicated that PSWL had a significant positive correlation (r = 0.231) with sugar content and a significant negative correlation with phenol content (r = -0.219). None of the accessions were found to be immune to bruchid infestation. However, out of studied accessions, EC528425 and EC528387 were identified as resistant based on PSWL and moderately resistant based on adult emergence. These resistance sources of cowpea germplasm can be used as potential donors for development of bruchid tolerant/resistant cultivars.

This study aimed to examine the potential of sweet sorghum juice for the generation of bioethanol using yeast isolated from the juice. The & DEG;Brix of sweet sorghum juice was measured using a digital refractometer. Additionally, 18 wild yeasts isolated from fermented sweet sorghum juice were subjected to various biochemical tests to describe them to identify potential yeast for ethanol production. The morphological and biochemical analyses of the yeasts revealed that all of the yeast isolates were most likely members of the genus Saccharomyces. The most ethanol-tolerant yeast isolate SJU14 was employed for sweet sorghum juice fermentation. A completely randomized factorial design was used with various fermentation parameters, primarily pH, temperature, and incubation period. Then ethanol content was determined using a potassium dichromate solution. According to the ANOVA, the highest ethanol content (18.765%) was produced at 30/26 & DEG;C, pH 4.5, and incubated for 96 h. Sweet sorghum juice was found to be an excellent source of potent yeasts, which have important industrial properties like the capacity to grow at high ethanol and glucose concentrations. Moreover, it can be utilized as a substitute substrate for the manufacturing of bioethanol production to lessen the environmental threat posed by fossil fuels. Further research is, therefore, recommended to develop strategically valuable applications of sweet sorghum for enhancing the food system and mitigating climate change.

J	Wang, CG; Zhang, XM; Wang, YX; Ma, B				Wang, Chenguang; Zhang, Xiumei; Wang, Yangxiu; Ma, Bo			Effects of straw mixed mulch length and coverage on infiltration, soil and water loss of Loess Plateau slopes	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												To study the influence of the wheat straw length and mulching on soil erosion under mixed mulch application, indoor simulation experiments were adopted to study the characteristics of infiltration, runoff and sediment yield changes under a rainfall intensity of 90 mm hr(-1). The results indicated that the length, coverage and interaction imposed significant effects on these variables. With increasing coverage, the infiltration exhibits a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. The change trend of runoff and sediment is the opposite of the infiltration trend. When the length is less than or equal to 8-10 cm and the coverage is lower than 4.5 t hm(-2), the sum of the length and coverage multiplied by the length and coverage attains a power function relationship with the slope infiltration rate. When the length is greater than or equal to 8-10 cm and the coverage is lower than 4.5 t hm(-2), the sum of the length and coverage multiplied by the coverage divided by the length attains a power function relationship with slope infiltration rate. The reciprocal of these two variables attains a power function relationship with runoff and sediment yield. In this study, when the length ranged from 8-10 cm and the coverage was 3.5 t hm(-2), the average infiltration rate was the highest, and the cumulative runoff and sediment yield were the lowest. Mixed straw mulching can effectively increase infiltration and reduce runoff and sediment yield, which is of great significance for the sustainable development of agriculture and ecology on slope farms.																			1085-3278	1099-145X				JUN	2023	34	10					2931	2944		10.1002/ldr.4657	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4657		MAR 2023											WOS:000952631900001

This study aims to uncover the mechanisms underlying heat and drought tolerance in lentil accessions. To achieve this objective, twelve accessions were subjected to high-temperature stress (32/20 degrees C), while seven accessions underwent assessment under drought stress conditions (50% of field capacity) during the reproductive stage. Our findings revealed a significant increase in catalase activity across all accessions under both stress conditions, with ILL7814 and ILL7835 recording the highest accumulations of 10.18 and 9.33 under drought stress, respectively, and 14 mu mol H2O2 mg protein-1 min-1 under high temperature. Similarly, ascorbate peroxidase significantly increased in all tolerant accessions due to high temperatures, with ILL6359, ILL7835, and ILL8029 accumulating the highest values with up 50 mu mol ascorbate mg protein-1 min-1. In contrast, no significant increase was obtained for all accessions subjected to water stress, although the drought-tolerant accessions accumulated more APX activity (16.59 t to 25.08 mu mol ascorbate mg protein-1 min-1) than the sensitive accessions. The accessions ILL6075, ILL7814, and ILL8029 significantly had the highest superoxide dismutase activity under high temperature, while ILL6363, ILL7814, and ILL7835 accumulated the highest values under drought stress, each with 22 to 25 units mg protein-1. Under both stress conditions, ILL7814 and ILL7835 recorded the highest contents in proline (38 to 45 mu mol proline/g FW), total flavonoids (0.22 to 0.77 mg QE g-1 FW), total phenolics (7.50 to 8.79 mg GAE g-1 FW), total tannins (5.07 to 20 mu g CE g-1 FW), and total antioxidant activity (60 to 70%). Further, ILL7814 and ILL6338 significantly recorded the highest total soluble sugar content under high temperature (71.57 and 74.24 mg g-1, respectively), while ILL7835 achieved the maximum concentration (125 mg g-1) under drought stress. The accessions ILL8029, ILL6104, and ILL7814 had the highest values of reducing sugar under high temperature with 0.62 to 0.79 mg g-1, whereas ILL6075, ILL6363, and ILL6362 accumulated the highest levels of this component under drought stress with 0.54 to 0.66 mg g-1. Overall, our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the metabolomic responses of lentil to drought and heat stresses, serving as a valuable reference for lentil stress tolerance breeding.

J	Li, PP; Wang, B; Yang, YF; Liu, GB				Li, Pan-pan; Wang, Bing; Yang, Yan-fen; Liu, Guo-bin			Effects of nitrogen addition on the soil detachment in the typical grasslands of the Loess Plateau	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												Nitrogen deposition will alleviate the nitrogen limitation in terrestrial ecosystems and greatly affect vegetation growth, thereby soil erosion. It is important to clarify the effects of nitrogen addition to the plant roots and soil properties on the soil erosion process. A nitrogen addition experiment was conducted in the grassland dominated by Bothriochloa ischaemum (Linn.) Keng (BI), which has received 0, 2.5, 5, and 10 g N m(-2) yr(-1) (N-0, N-2.5, N-5 and N-10, respectively) for three consecutive years. Then, a total of 150 undisturbed soil samples were collected (including bare soil control) and subjected to flowing water to test their soil detachment capacities under six shear stress levels (10.2 Pa to 29.9 Pa). Three-year nitrogen addition increased the soil bulk density, soil cohesion and nitrate nitrogen while decreasing the saturated hydraulic conductivity, soil water-stable aggregates, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen. The root mass density and root diameter decreased with nitrogen addition. And the root length, surface area and volume density of the N-0 and N-5 treatments were larger than those of the other treatments, while the plant roots were significantly inhibited by N-10. Additionally, the soil detachment capacity (D-c) and rill erodibility (K-r) of the N-0 and N-5 treatments were significantly less than those of the N-2.5 and N-10 treatments, of which the D-c (0.020 kg m(-2) s(-1)) of the N-0 treatment was 69.0%, 24.3% and 66.8% less than that of the N-2.5, N-5 and N-10 treatments, respectively. The K-r of the N-0 treatment was 0.0012 s m(-1), which was 72.1%, 25.0% and 70.0% less than that of the others. This study implies that an increase in nitrogen addition likely exacerbates soil erosion in the early (approximately 2.5 g N m(-2) yr(-1)) and late phases (more than 10 g N m(-2) yr(-1)). However, when the nitrogen addition rate is approximately 5 g m(-2) yr(-1), soil erosion may be inhibited because of the responses of the plant roots and soil to nitrogen addition.

However, no detailed research has been conducted in the northern China semi-arid area in returning the different organic materials to the field and determining the status of eukaryotic microorganisms. Therefore, we explored the effects of various organic materials returning to the soil in combination with inorganic fertilizer on the diversity and community structure of eukaryotic microorganisms in Shanxi province, China. Soil samples were collected from five different fertilization treatments: chemical fertilizer (F), chemical fertilizer + cattle manure (FM), chemical fertilizer + straw (FS), chemical fertilizer + pig manure (FC) and control without fertilizers (CK). High-throughput sequencing was applied to analyze the eukaryotic diversity and community structure. Results showed that the dominant eukaryotic microorganisms among soil samples were Fungi, Viridiplantae, Metazoa and Protist. Although alpha-diversity was not significantly different among the five treatments, principal coordinate analysis and permutational multivariate analysis of variance illustrated significant differences (p < 0.001) in beta-diversity of eukaryotic microorganism under treatments with different organic materials. Redundancy analysis showed that the soil properties, including total potassium, available nitrogen, available potassium and organic matter were the main factors attributed to eukaryotic microorganisms' community structure in this region.																				2073-4395				DEC	2022	12	12							3116	10.3390/agronomy12123116	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12123116													WOS:000900212200001

Five different type of machine learning model namely (i) decision tree, (ii) Random Forest (RF), (iii) Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), (iv) Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) and (v) Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were compared for performance in estimating daily P-M ETo values. The RF, GBM and XGBoost model performed extremely well on the criteria of weighted standard error of estimate (WSEE) which is less than 0.25 mm/d. Furthermore, the ensembled machine learning model substantiated by boosting algorithm (XGBoost) significantly enhance the performance in estimating P-M ETo (WSEE is less than 0.17 mm/d). Moreover, the sensitivity analysis suggested that the data requirement for XGBoost is commonly available at most of the places unlike P-M ETo model. Given the generalization capability of the model, it can be successfully implemented for other similar location where comprehensive data are not available.																			0920-4741	1573-1650				FEB	2022	36	3					1025	1042		10.1007/s11269-022-03067-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-022-03067-7		JAN 2022											WOS:000743846500001

However, instead of competing with a flexible and continuous chain, we consider a discrete chain made of N identical links. By using the elementary tools of Newtonian mechanics, we show that there is a simple relation between the angles of the links' slope that enable us to find the N discrete chain solution. We also investigate the limit of the continuous chain and show that the discrete solution converges into the well-known classical solution of the catenary problem. The advantage of this new method is that it better enables the attainment of a physical insight into the problem in a quite simple way, without using advanced mathematics.

The analysis is based on all 228 households of the village and focus group discussions. The results show that there is a large exclusion error in targeted programmes, which have mostly excluded the poor and the needy. Most schemes have a prerequisite of asset ownership, such as agricultural land, which benefits resource-rich farmers with large landholdings. The relationship between benefits received and income of households is best represented by an inverted 'u'-shape curve, indicating the middle-income category benefits more than the poorest. The scope and scale of welfare programmes, especially Direct Benefit Transfers, increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. For inclusion of the poorest of the poor, welfare and development schemes need to be decoupled from landownership in rural areas.

However, the ecological stoichiometric homeostasis of Robinia pseudoacacia L. in different climatic regions is poorly understood but could provide insights into its adaptability in the loess hilly region. This study sampled 20 year-old R. pseudoacacia plantations at 10 sites along a north-south transect on the Loess Plateau. Variations in the ecological stoichiometric characteristics of leaf and soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus were analysed and homeostatic characteristics of leaf ecological stoichiometric parameters in different climates were identified. Factors affecting leaf stoichiometry were assessed. The results show that R. pseudoacacia leaves were rich in nitrogen and deficient in phosphorous during tree growth and development. Nitrogen and phosphorous levels in the soils of the loess region were lower than the average in soils in the rest of China. All ecological stoichiometric parameters of R. pseudoacacia leaves in two different climates were considered "strictly homeostasis". Precipitation, available phosphorus, and soil C:P were the main factors affecting the variation of C:N:P stoichiometry of R. pseudoacacia leaves. R. pseudoacacia in the loess hilly region has strong ecologically homeostatic characteristics and suggests that it is well-adapted to the area.

J	Wang, YB; Shangguan, ZP				Wang Yaobin; Shangguan, Zhouping			Formation mechanisms and remediation techniques for low-efficiency artificial shelter forests on the Chinese Loess Plateau	JOURNAL OF ARID LAND												The construction of artificial shelter forests (ASFs) has resulted in substantial ecological, economic, and societal benefits to the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). However, the health and benefits of ASFs are being increasingly threatened by the formation of low-efficiency artificial shelter forests (LEASFs). In this study, LEASFs are systematically analyzed in terms of their status, formation mechanisms, and developmental obstacles. The key restoration techniques and schemes were summarized to improve the quality and efficiency of LEASFs. LEASFs are formed by relatively complex mechanisms, but they arise mainly due to poor habitat conditions, improper tree species selections, mismatch between stands and habitat, extensive forest management measures, and human interferences. The restoration and improvement of LEASFs are hindered by water deficits, mismatch between stands and habitat, single management purpose, and low efficiency. LEASFs are becoming more complex due to their wide range, the challenges associated with their restoration, and insufficient technological measures for their restoration. The key techniques of the quality and efficiency improvement of LEASFs include basic forest tending methods, near-natural restoration, multifunction-oriented improvement, and systematic restoration. An understanding on the formation mechanisms of LEASFs and a scientific approach toward their restoration are urgently needed and critical for the ecological protection and high-quality development of LEASFs on the CLP. Based on these analyses, we recommend strengthening the monitoring and supervision of LEASFs, considering the bearing capacity of regional water resources, implementing multiple restoration techniques, promoting multifunction-oriented ecological development, and exploring new management concepts to achieve the sustainable development of ASFs on the CLP.																			1674-6767	2194-7783				AUG	2022	14	8					837	848		10.1007/s40333-022-0069-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-022-0069-x		JUL 2022											WOS:000832840500001

Therefore, understanding the local circumstances of climate change is vital to exert context specific responses to allay its adverse effects. This study hence assessed small holder farmers' perception and response mechanisms to climate change and their determinants in Tekeze lowland goat and sorghum livelihood zone, Northeast Ethiopia. Data collected from 260 sample respondents were analyzed in descriptive statistics and econometric model. Results revealed that 86.5% of the respondents observed changes in main climatic patterns, whereas 92.3% of them recognized variability in daily weather. Indeed, 76.8% and 83.5% of respondents perceived a rising temperature and decreasing rainfall, respectively. This finding is in line with the regression results of meteorological data recorded for 20 study years in the area. Among respondents who perceived the climate change, nearly two-third were responded through crop, livestock and nonagriculture-based livelihood initiatives. The probit model also discovered that educational status, farm/nonfarm income, extension contact, access to climate information and training were significant factors behind farmers' response decision. As a result, future development interventions should provide prominent training and extension, local meteorological service and agricultural inputs on top of creating nonagricultural income generating opportunities, would play significant role in climate change adaptation.					mihiretu, ademe/AHD-3473-2022; Tefera, Tesfaye Lemma/HGB-0540-2022	mihiretu, ademe/0000-0002-2861-5694; 													2331-1932					MAY 12	2020	6	1							1763647	10.1080/23311932.2020.1763647	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2020.1763647													WOS:000535969600001

Identifying major genes/loci associated with chlorophyll content in flag leaves under different phosphorus conditions is critical for breeding wheat varieties resistant to low phosphorus (P). Under normal, medium, and low phosphorus conditions, the chlorophyll content of flag leaves was investigated by a double haploid (DH) population derived from a cross between two popular wheat varieties Jinmai 47 and Jinmai 84, at different grain filling stages. Chlorophyll content of the DH population and parents decreased gradually during the S1 to the S3 stages and rapidly at the S4 stage. At the S4 stage, the chlorophyll content of the DH population under low phosphorus conditions was significantly lower than under normal phosphate conditions. Using a wheat 15K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel, a total of 157 QTLs were found to be associated with chlorophyll content in flag leaf and were identified under three phosphorus conditions. The phenotypic variation explained (PVE) ranged from 3.07 to 31.66%. Under three different phosphorus conditions, 36, 30, and 48 QTLs for chlorophyll content were identified, respectively. Six major QTLs Qchl.saw-2B.1, Qchl.saw-3B.1, Qchl.saw-4D.1, Qchl.saw-4D.2, Qchl.saw-5A.9 and Qchl.saw-6A.4 could be detected under multiple phosphorus conditions in which Qchl.saw-4D.1, Qchl.saw-4D.2, and Qchl.saw-6A.4 were revealed to be novel major QTLs. Moreover, the closely linked SNP markers of Qchl.saw-4D.1 and Qchl.saw-4D.2 were validated as KASP markers in a DH population sharing the common parent Jinmai 84, showed extreme significance (P <0.01) in more than three environments under different phosphorus conditions, which has the potential to be utilized in molecular marker-assisted breeding for low phosphorus tolerance in wheat.					wang, KiKi/JFZ-3334-2023														1664-462X					NOV 17	2022	13								1019012	10.3389/fpls.2022.1019012	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.1019012								36466250					WOS:000892690700001

To demonstrate the utility and power of this approach, two NAM populations, NAM_Tifrunner and NAM_Florida-07, were used for dissecting genetic control of 100-pod weight (PW) and 100-seed weight (SW) in peanut. Two high-density SNP-based genetic maps were constructed with 3341 loci and 2668 loci for NAM_Tifrunner and NAM_Florida-07, respectively. The quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis identified 12 and 8 major effect QTLs for PW and SW, respectively, in NAM_Tifrunner, and 13 and 11 major effect QTLs for PW and SW, respectively, in NAM_Florida-07. Most of the QTLs associated with PW and SW were mapped on the chromosomes A05, A06, B05 and B06. A genomewide association study (GWAS) analysis identified 19 and 28 highly significant SNP-trait associations (STAs) in NAM_Tifrunner and 11 and 17 STAs in NAM_Florida-07 for PW and SW, respectively. These significant STAs were co-localized, suggesting that PW and SW are co-regulated by several candidate genes identified on chromosomes A05, A06, B05, and B06. This study demonstrates the utility of NAM population for genetic dissection of complex traits and performing high-resolution trait mapping in peanut.

J	Noritomo, Y; Takahashi, K				Noritomo, Yuma; Takahashi, Kazushi			Can Insurance Payouts Prevent a Poverty Trap? Evidence from Randomised Experiments in Northern Kenya	JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES												Index-based insurance can have welfare-enhancing effects through two pathways: by inducing policyholders to change their investment and risk-management decisions or by mitigating weather-related shocks through payouts. Most studies fail to distinguish between these two; thus, we know little about which effects dominate and their long-term welfare implications. This study uses a random distribution of discount coupons and drought events that trigger payouts as exogenous variations in order to identify both the ex ante risk-management and ex post payout effects of index-based livestock insurance in a pastoral-dominant society of northern Kenya, where the literature has detected asset-based poverty traps, represented by bifurcated herd-size dynamics. We find that, first, both risk-management and payout effects help reduce the probability of distress sales of livestock. Second, payout effects also reduce the slaughter of livestock. Finally, while payout effects remain robust for the sub-sample of poorer households below the poverty-trap threshold, statistically significant risk-management effects on reduced livestock sales disappear for them. Overall, our results suggest that insurance payouts can help the poor escape poverty traps, while the impact of behavioural changes accompanied by insurance purchases is more subtle in our settings.

Camels were used as pack animals, for transportation, and for plowing. These functions have recently been replaced by motorized vehicles. Urbanization changed Bedouin societies and presently there is much less need and space available to maintain camels. While the number of camels increased worldwide, mainly because of meat and milk production, the number of camels among Negev Bedouin decreased. They rarely eat camel meat and milk production is on a small scale, mostly unofficial. Most, particular younger Bedouin, believe that they are less identified with camels than with sheep and goats. All, however, expressed their desire to maintain camels for traditional reasons, but complained that it is difficult to do so due to a lack of grazing lands, government indifference, and tax laws concerning camels.

Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is a commonly applied tool in the economic analysis of landscape restoration, yet its application seems limited and varied. We undertake a review of CBA applications to understand the breadth, depth, and gaps. Of the 2056 studies identified in literature search, only 31 met our predefined criteria. Three studies offered a global perspective, while more than half were conducted in Africa. Only six countries benefit from at least 2 CBA studies, including Brazil, Ethiopia, Kenya, Vietnam, South Africa, and Tanzania. About 60% focus on agroforestry, afforestation, reforestation, and assisted natural regeneration practices. Only 16% covered all cost categories, with opportunity costs being the least covered. Eighty-four percent apply direct use values, while only 16% captured the non-use values. Similarly, lack of reliable data due to predictions and assumptions involved in data generation influenced CBA results. The limited number of eligible studies and the weaknesses identified hereinabove suggest strong need for improvements in both the quantity and quality of CBA to better inform planning, policies, and investments in landscape restoration.

Spring triticale forage responses to seeding rate and nitrogen application	AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES & ENVIRONMENT												Growing spring forages could reduce soil erosion and increase cropping system profitability compared with summer fallow in a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench ssp. Bicolor)-fallow system. Field experiments were conducted over four site-years to evaluate seeding rate and nitrogen (N) application effects on spring triticale forage production. Seeding rates (60, 80, and 100 kg ha(-1)) were assigned to main plot treatments, and N rates (0, 11, 34, 56, and 78 kg N ha(-1)) were the subplots. Seeding rate had no effect on forage dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), or mineral nutrients. However, increasing seeding rate increased lignin, acid detergent fiber (ADF), and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) concentrations while decreasing in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) and total digestible nutrients. Applying N increased forage DM, with optimum yield occurring at 56 kg N ha(-1). The application of N fertilizer decreased ADF and NDF concentrations but increased CP, IVDMD, and total digestible nutrients. Similarly, tissue calcium, phosphorus, and potassium concentrations increased with N fertilizer application. Based on our findings, 56 kg N ha(-1) was adequate for spring triticale and seeding triticale forage at a lower rate of 60 kg ha(-1) had no detrimental effect on forage yield when harvested as hay.

Due to the intermittent nature of run-off events, it is necessary to store the maximum possible amount of rainwater during the rainy season so that it may be used as irrigation to enhance the crop productivity and farm income under soybean based cropping system. Methods: A study was carried out during 2018-2019 in Indore district of Malwa region. Rainwater harvesting tanks at on station (42x21x2. 4 m) and on farm (15x11x4 m) were constructed for irrigation water availability. Provision of water harvesting tank increased the irrigation water availability (1781 m3 and 630 m3 respectively) and stored water was managed through various irrigation systems viz. rain gun, drip and flood. Result: It was resulted that the provision of water harvesting tanks enhanced the crop productivity and farm income under soybean based cropping system. Availability of irrigation encouraged the farmers to diversify the cropping pattern (soybean-chickpea, soybean-wheat). It is also clear from the study that even with smaller storage tank and through conjunctive use of ground (1164.2 m3) and surface water (596 m3), multiple crops (soybean, potato, sweet corn, chickpea, onion, garlic etc.) can be grown. Soybean-Chickpea cropping system at station gave the net return of 70976 Rs/ha with B: C ratio of 3.15. Soybean-Wheat cropping system at farm gave the net return of 119000 Rs/ha with B:C ratio of 3.38.																			0250-5371					NOV	2022	45	11					1440	1444		10.18805/A-5447	http://dx.doi.org/10.18805/A-5447													WOS:000891314200016

Recently, polymorphisms in the LEP gene revealed a significant change in body weight regulation, energy balance, food intake, and reproductive hormone secretion. This study considers its crucial role in the regulation of the economically important traits of sheep. Several computational tools, including SIFT, Predict SNP2, SNAP2, and PROVEAN, have been used to screen out the deleterious nsSNPs. Following the screening of 11 nsSNPs in the sheep genome, 5 nsSNPs, T86M (C -> T), D98N (G -> A), N136T (A -> C), R142Q (G -> A), and P157Q (C -> A), were predicted to have a significant deleterious effect on the LEP protein function, leading to phenotypic difference. The analysis of proteins' stability change due to amino acid substitution using the I-stable, SDM, and DynaMut consistently confirmed that three nsSNPs (T86M (C -> T), D98N (G -> A), and P157Q (C -> A)) increased protein stability. It is suggested that these three nsSNPs may enhance the evolvability of LEP protein, which is vital for the evolutionary adaptation of sheep. Our findings demonstrate that the five nsSNPs reported in this study might be responsible for sheep's structural and functional modifications of LEP protein. This is the first comprehensive report on the sheep LEP gene. It narrow downs the candidate nsSNPs for in vitro experiments to facilitate the development of reliable molecular markers for associated traits.

Canola rotation effects on soil water and subsequent wheat in the Pacific Northwest USA	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Farmers in Mediterranean climate regions are increasingly growing canola (Brassica napus L.) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-based systems to break soil-borne pathogen disease cycles, control weeds, and enhance crop marketing opportunities. A 6-year rainfed cropping systems experiment was conducted near Ritzville, Washington USA from 2015 to 2021. The objective was to compare performance of winter and spring canola, winter triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack) (WT), and winter wheat (WW) and measure their effects on soil water dynamics and subsequent performance of spring wheat (SW). Overwinter soil water gain in canola stubble was significantly reduced compared to water gain in WT and WW stubble. The more winter precipitation, the greater the differences in soil water among treatments in early spring. There was a trend in all years for diminished overwinter soil water gain in canola stubble. Averaged over years, grain yield of SW was 1940, 2340, and 2210 kg/ha grown on canola, WT, and WW stubble, respectively (p = 0.045). Coefficients of determination from regression analysis conducted each year showed a high correlation between water content in the 180 cm profile in early spring and SW grain yield, except in one year of extreme drought. This paper provides a first report in a Mediterranean climate region of decline in wheat grain yield after canola versus after a cereal crops, primarily due to reduced overwinter soil water storage.

Assessment of land-use and land-cover changes in Pangari watershed area (MS), India, based on the remote sensing and GIS techniques	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												In this paper, we focus on the assessment of land-use and land-cover change detection mapping to the effective planning and management policies of environment, land-use policy and hydrological system in the study area. In this study the soil and water conservation project has been applied during the five years and after five years what changes have been found in the land-use and land-cover classes and vegetation. In this view, this land-use and land-cover mapping is a more important role to decide the policy for watershed planning and management project in the semiarid region. In an emerging countries, fast industrialization and urbanization impose a significant threat to the natural atmosphere. The remote sensing and GIS techniques are crucial roles in the study of land-use and land-cover mapping during the years of 2007, 2014, and 2017. The main objective of this is to prepare the land-use and NDVI maps in the years of 2008, 2014 and 2017; these maps have prepared from satellite data using the supervised classification method. A normalized difference vegetation index map (NDVI) was done by using Landsat 8 and LISS-III satellite data. NDVI values play a major role in monitoring the vegetation and variation in land-use and land-cover classes. In these maps, four types of land are divided into four classes as agriculture, built-up, wasteland, and water body. The results of study show that agriculture land of 18.71% (158.24 Ha), built-up land of 0.62% (5.31 Ha), wasteland of 40.33% (341.02 Ha), and water body land of 17.39% (147 Ha) are increased. Land-use and land-cover maps and NDVI values show that agriculture land of 22.97% (194.29 Ha), 5.46% (14.59 Ha), and 0.08% (0.22 Ha) decreases during the years of 2008, 2014, and 2017. The results directly indicate that the supervised classification method has been the accurate identified feature in the land-use map classes. This classification method has been given the better accuracy (95%) from spatiotemporal satellite data. The accuracy was also tally with ground-truth and Google earth information. These results can be a very useful for the land-use policy, watershed planning, and management with natural resources, animals, and ecological systems.

Here, two peanut cultivars (salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive) were subjected to salinity stress, and the alleviation effects of combined microbial agent (CMA, inoculation with AMF + application with LP) on peanut salinity tolerance have been comprehensively characterized. CMA significantly enhanced the biomass production, leaf relative water content, increased the net photosynthetic rate, the maximal photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) and strengthened the antioxidant system, while dramatically decreased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, lipid peroxidation and relative electrolyte conductivity under salinity conditions. Moreover, transcriptional and metabolomic evidence advocated that a subset of stress-responsive pathways involved in plant growth (e.g. sucrose and starch), photosystem, antioxidant response, signal transduction (e.g. phytohormone and MAPK), osmotic homeostasis (e.g. total soluble sugar and amino acids) and root metabolism (e.g. asparagine and phenylpropanoid) have been regulated by CMA. Taken together, the physiological, transcriptional and metabolomic results indicate that CMA could induce peanut salinity tolerance through increasing plant growth performance, maintaining photosynthetic apparatus integrity, enhancing antioxidant system and regulating root metabolism. This study provides a promising CMA product and would be important for deepening the knowledge of the mechanisms regarding bacterial-fungal interactions.					; Si, Tong/ACE-9331-2022	xiaoxia, zou/0000-0002-1087-6167; Si, Tong/0000-0003-4984-9585													0931-2250	1439-037X				2023 OCT 4	2023										10.1111/jac.12672	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jac.12672		OCT 2023											WOS:001093144200001

We have previously shown that exogenous application of (Z)-3-hexeny-1-yl acetate (Z-3-HAC), a kind of GLV, could alleviate salt stress in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) seedlings; however, notably little is known concerning the transcription regulation mechanisms of Z-3-HAC. In this study, we comprehensively characterized the transcriptomes and physiological indices of peanut seedlings exposed to Z-3-HAC and/or salt stress. Analysis of transcriptome data showed that 1420 genes were upregulated in the seedlings primed with Z-3-HAC under salt stress compared with the non-primed treatment. Interestingly, these genes were significantly enriched in the photosynthetic and ascorbate metabolism-related categories, as well as several plant hormone metabolism pathways. The physiological data revealed that Z-3-HAC significantly increased the net photosynthetic rate, SPAD value, plant height and shoot biomass compared with the non-primed peanut seedlings under salt stress. A significantly higher ratio of K+:Na+, reduced-to-oxidized glutathione (GSH:GSSG), and ascorbate-to-dehydroascorbate (AsA:DHA) were also observed for the plants primed with Z-3-HAC compared with the salt stress control. Meanwhile, Z-3-HAC significantly increased the activity of enzymes in the AsA-GSH cycle. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of Z-3-HAC in protecting peanut seedlings against salt stress by affecting photosynthesis, cellular redox homeostasis, K+:Na+ homeostasis, and phytohormones.

The objective of this study was, therefore, to predict putative candidate genes associated with resistance to SBR in line UG-5 and understand their functions using different bioinformatics tools from the online available databases. The physical positions for the flanking markers of the identified putative QTLs were searched on the SoyBase database genome browser based on Glyma 1.01 assembly. The putative candidate genes and annotated functions of the surrounding genes were discovered in the vicinity using SoyBase and Phytozome databases. A total of 18 putative candidate genes were predicted on approximately 482.7 kb region of QTL-3 (chromosome 18), among which, six putative candidate genes were found to encode leucine-rich repeat (LRR), Ser/Thr protein phosphatase, leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase (LRR-RLK) and chitinase-related proteins, which are associated with plant defence signalling pathways. Moreover, F-box and leucine-rich repeat, glycosyltransferase family member and serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit coding genes were predicted on the novel putative QTL detected on chromosome 9. This information could, therefore, be used for further prediction and annotation of candidate genes from sequenced regions of line UG-5 as these putative candidate genes were predicted from the Glyma 1.01 assembly.

However, most research to date in Ethiopia particularly in the Tigray regional state has focused on the effects of soil chemical properties and relatively little work has been done on soil physical properties. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of compost, blended (NPSZn), and potassium chloride (KCl) fertilizers on soil bulk density (BD) and moisture content (SMC). Therefore, a field experiment was carried out for 2018-2019 years to study the influence of sole and combined application of compost, NPSZn, and KCl fertilizers on BD and SMC in clay loam and loamy sand soil textures in Tigray. Two compost (0 and 20 t center dot ha-1), three NPSZn (0, 60, and 120 kg center dot ha-1), and four KCl (0, 120, 210, and 300 kg center dot ha-1) rates replicated three times were arranged in split-split plot design and allocated to main, sub, and sub-subplots, respectively. BD (g center dot cm-3) and SMC (%) data were collected from 0 to 10 and 0 to 30 cm soil depths before and after harvesting in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Sole and combined application of the fertilizers considerably influenced BD and SMC in both soil textural groups and years. Compost applied in combination with NPSZn at 120 kg center dot ha-1 and KCl at 300 kg center dot ha-1 significantly reduced BD (1.24 g center dot cm-3 in 2018 and 1.22 g center dot cm-3 in 2019) in clay loam soils as compared to all treatments. Similarly, the lowest BD (1.5 g center dot cm-3 in 2018 and 1.47 g center dot cm-3 in 2019) was observed in loamy sand soils. The highest volumetric SMC (21% in both years) was observed in clay loam soil in plots treated with compost. Likewise, the highest SMC (12% in 2018 and 11% in 2019) was found in loamy sand soils in compost-treated plots. This study demonstrated that SMC and BD can be improved through compost and compost combined with NPSZn and KCl application, respectively, in the drylands of Northern Ethiopia.

The objective of this study was to evaluate water-saving index (WSI), yield factors, and KASP (kompetitive allele specific polymerase chain reaction) markers in water-saving wheat breeding carried out in Hengshui region, China. The result showed as follows: (1) The new index WSI could better indicate the water-saving performance, including the yield potential and the stability of different wheat cultivars under water limited condition (WL). (2) Referring to the degree of heat stress (D) in that year, selecting one of the three yield factors as the focus will improve the breeding efficiency of water-saving wheat cultivars. With the increase of the D within a certain range, high water-saving wheat cultivars showed a high grain weight (GW) under WL. Meanwhile with the decreasing of D value, high water-saving wheat cultivars showed high spike number under WL. (3) KASP aggregation breeding will significantly improve the efficiency of water-saving breeding. The combination with the highest effective rate of selecting water-saving varieties carried GS5-2334-SNP and Dreb_SNP favorable alleles, and GW2-6B-1709SNP, TaMoc-2433, and 1fehw with adverse alleles, whereas GS5-2334-SNP and GW2-6B-1709SNP that related to GW were useful markers for water-saving breeding. These results improved our knowledge on the usage of WSI, yield factors, and KASP markers on water-saving wheat breeding.																			0002-1962	1435-0645				2023 MAR 13	2023										10.1002/agj2.21267	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.21267		MAR 2023											WOS:000948524200001

In this study, we show that multiplexed host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) of Aspergillus flavus genes essential for fungal sporulation and aflatoxin production (nsdC, veA, aflR, and aflM) confers enhanced resistance to Aspergillus infection and aflatoxin contamination in groundnut (<20 ppb). Comparative proteomic analysis of contrasting groundnut genotypes (WT and near-isogenic HIGS lines) supported a better understanding of the molecular processes underlying the induced resistance and identified several groundnut metabolites that might play a significant role in resistance to Aspergillus infection and aflatoxin contamination. Fungal differentiation and pathogenicity proteins, including calmodulin, transcriptional activator-HacA, kynurenine 3-monooxygenase 2, VeA, VelC, and several aflatoxin pathway biosynthetic enzymes, were downregulated in Aspergillus infecting the HIGS lines. Additionally, in the resistant HIGS lines, a number of host resistance proteins associated with fatty acid metabolism were strongly induced, including phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase, lysophosphatidic acyltransferase-5, palmitoyl-monogalactosyldiacylglycerol ?-7 desaturase, ceramide kinase-related protein, sphingolipid ?-8 desaturase, and phospholipase-D. Combined, this knowledge can be used for groundnut pre-breeding and breeding programs to provide a safe and secure food supply.

Phylogenetic and compositional diversity are governed by different rules: a study of fleas parasitic on small mammals in four biogeographic realms	ECOGRAPHY												We studied patterns of phylogenetic and compositional diversity of fleas parasitic on small mammals and asked whether these patterns are affected by environmental variation or evolutionary/historical processes. We considered environmental variation via both off-host (air temperature, precipitation, the amount of green vegetation, latitude) and host-associated (phylogenetic and species composition) environments. The indicators of evolutionary/historical processes were phylogenetic and compositional uniqueness estimated via phylogenetic or compositional, respectively, beta-diversity of either fleas or hosts. We found that phylogenetic uniqueness of flea assemblages was the main predictor of their phylogenetic diversity in all realms. In addition, host phylogenetic diversity and uniqueness played also some role in the Palearctic, whereas the effect of the off-host environment was either extremely weak or absent. Compositional diversity of fleas was consistently affected by compositional diversity of hosts in all realms except the Neotropics. The effect of the off-host environment on compositional flea diversity was substantial in all realms except the Palearctic. No effect of latitude on either metric of flea diversity was found. We conclude that phylogenetic diversity of fleas is driven mainly by evolutionary/historical processes, whereas drivers of their compositional diversity are associated with current ecological conditions.					van der Mescht, Luther/J-8349-2019; Khokhlova, Irina/F-2235-2012; Krasnov, Boris R./ABG-8403-2021	van der Mescht, Luther/0000-0001-8813-9549; Khokhlova, Irina/0000-0003-0169-7770; Krasnov, Boris R./0000-0002-0382-3331; Warburton, Elizabeth/0000-0001-8125-2741													0906-7590	1600-0587				MAY	2019	42	5			SI		1000	1011		10.1111/ecog.04224	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.04224													WOS:000466819000014
J	Zhou, FQ; Ding, JJ; Li, TT; Zhang, XM				Zhou, Fengqin; Ding, Junjun; Li, Tingting; Zhang, Ximei			Plant communities are more sensitive than soil microbial communities to multiple environmental changes in the Eurasian steppe	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Understanding species responsiveness to anthropogenic environmental changes benefits the guide to manage biodiversity. Microbes are traditionally thought to be more sensitive to environmental changes than plants. However, this hypothesis is supported by little empirical evidence. We compared plant and microbial responses to 13 types of simulated environmental changes (mowing (M), adding nitrogen (N), adding phosphorus (P), watering (W), warming (T) and combinations of these) in a steppe ecosystem. Contrary to our hypothesis, the microbial responses were generally smaller than the plant responses to different types of environmental changes, both at the community-abundance level and species/operational taxonomic unit (OTU)/gene level. This might be ascribed to the soil buffering capacity to environmental changes, and the rapid evolutionary adaptation for microbial communities. Furthermore, the responses at the community-abundance level were larger than at the species/OTU/gene level to 13 types of environmental changes, both in plant and microbial communities. Given that the community abundance representing the total number of all individuals of the organism within the community, the responses to environmental changes at the community-abundance level is likely to be larger than at the species/OTU/gene level. Plant biomass was more responsive to N addition, particularly in such N- limiting grassland ecosystem. Our findings highlight that plant communities are more responsive to environmental changes than microbial communities, contrary to the traditional viewpoint. Therefore, plant communities could be used as ecological indicators of anthropogenic environmental changes in grasslands.

Materials and methods We investigated soil N2O emissions, the genes related to N2O production and reduction (AOA-amoA, AOB-amoA, nirK, nirS, and nosZ), and associated microbial communities in four meadows (continuous grazing, grazing exclusion by fencing, grazing exclusion by combined fencing and reseeding, and undisturbed meadow) in the Tibetan Plateau to reveal the mechanism underlying potential N2O emissions in alpine meadows. Results and discussion Compared to the grazing meadow, fencing and fencing + reseeding meadows had lower N2O emissions and lower abundances of AOA-amoA, AOB-amoA, nirK, nirS, and nosZ genes, suggesting that grazing exclusion could decrease the soil N-turnover potential. However, the higher N2O emissions compared to those of undisturbed meadows indicated that longer restoration periods were necessary. Seeding the fenced meadow did not alter soil N2O emission or the abundance of AOA-amoA, AOB-amoA, nirK, nirS, and nosZ genes, possibly owing to the similar soil nutrient status compared to that of the fencing meadow. Grazing exclusion also resulted in significant changes in the community diversity and composition of microbes harboring these functional genes, especially nirK and nosZ communities. N2O emissions were significantly associated with microbial communities involved in N2O production and reduction but not with the gene abundance of AOA-amoA, AOB-amoA, nirK, nirS, and nosZ. Soil dissolved organic nutrients, including C and N, and soil moisture were the controlling factors for N2O production by altering the community composition of nirK- and nosZ-type denitrifiers, such as Bradyrhizobiaceae, Rhizobiaceae, Brucellaceae, Ochrobactrum, and Proteobacteria. Conclusions Our results indicated that grazing-induced elevation of potential N2O emissions from meadow soil could be alleviated by grazing exclusion, including sole fencing and a combination of fencing and reseeding, by changing soil dissolved organic nutrients and moisture thus regulating the microbial communities.

J	Meunier, F; Verbruggen, W; Verbeeck, H; Peaucelle, M				Meunier, Felicien; Verbruggen, Wim; Verbeeck, Hans; Peaucelle, Marc			Low sensitivity of three terrestrial biosphere models to soil texture over the South American tropics	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												Drought stress is an increasing threat for vegetation in tropical regions, within the context of human-induced increase of drought frequency and severity observed over South American forests. Drought stress is induced when a plant's water demand is not met with its water supply through root water uptake. The latter depends on root and soil properties, including soil texture (i.e. the soil clay and sand fractions) that determines the soil water availability and its hydraulic properties. Hence, soil clay content is responsible for a significant fraction of the spatial variability in forest structure and productivity. Soil-textural properties largely vary at the spatial resolution used by Terrestrial Biosphere Models (TBMs) and it is currently unclear how this variability affects the outputs of these models used to predict the response of vegetation ecosystems to future climate change scenarios. In this study, we assessed the sensitivity of the carbon cycle of three state-of-the-art TBMs, i.e. ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic EcosystEms (ORCHIDEEv2.2), Ecosystem Demography model version 2 (ED2), and Lund-Potsdam-Jena General Ecosystem Simulator (LPJ-GUESS) to soil-textural properties at the regional level over the South American tropics using model default pedotransfer functions. For all three TBMs, the model outputs, including gross primary productivity (GPP), aboveground biomass (AGB), soil carbon content and drought stress, were shown to be mostly insensitive to soil-texture changes representative of the spatial variability in soil properties, except for a small region characterised by very low water availability in ORCHIDEEv2.2 and ED2. We argue that generic pedotransfer and simple drought stress functions, as currently implemented in TBMs, should be reconsidered to better capture the role of soil texture and its coupling to plant processes. Similarly, we suggest that better estimates of the soil-texture uncertainty resulting from soil-texture data aggregate should be considered in the future. Those steps forward are critical to properly account for future increasing drought stress conditions in tropical regions.

Cultivars showed highly significant (p < 0.001) differences in their chemical composition. The cultivars' content of ash, crude protein (CP), dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD), acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and Cell (cellulose) varied, with ranges of 8.18-22.75%, 3.19-10.40%, 86.40-91.88%, 77.45-91.82%, 68.25-87.3%, 55.81-78.95%, 14.88-26.15%, 29.66-67.05% and 10.99-19.92%, respectively. The ash content showed a significant highly negative correlation with OM (r = -1.00; p < 0.001), IVDMD (r = -0.603; p < 0.001) and DOMD (r = -0.904; p < 0.001), respectively. The Garao, Aloqa and O. robusta var. X11 cultivars showed the highest similarities, as they are found close to the first branch of the dendrogram. In total, 90% of the variation among the nutritional traits was attributed to the first four PCs, with 55.97% to the first two principal components (PCs).

ELPs' role in plant growth and development, signal transduction, and response to biotic and abiotic stresses have been confirmed in model plants. However, the functions of the wheat ELP genes are not well documented. The present study identified 18 members of the ELPs from the wheat genome with a homology search. Further, bioinformatics and transcription patterns in response to different stress conditions were analyzed to dissect their potential regulatory mechanisms in wheat. Gene duplication analysis showed that 18 pairs of ELP paralogous genes were derived from segmental duplication, which was divided into six clades by protein phylogenetic and cluster analysis. The orthologous analysis of wheat TaELP genes showed that TaELP genes may have evolved from orthologous genes of other plant species or closely related plants. Moreover, a variety of cis-acting regulatory elements (CAREs) related to growth and development, hormone response, and biotic and abiotic stresses were identified in the TaELPs' promoter regions. The qRT-PCR analysis showed that the transcription of TaELPs was induced under hormone, salt, and drought stress and during leaf senescence. The TaELP2 gene was silenced with BSMV-VIGS, and TaELP2 was preliminarily verified to be involved in the regulation of wheat leaf senescence. Overall, TaELP genes might be regulated by hormone signaling pathways and response to abiotic stress and leaf senescence, which could be investigated further as potential candidate genes for wheat abiotic stress tolerance and yield improvement.

In this study, Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-time-of-flight-tandem mass spectrometer (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS) was used to determine the lipids of JG35 and JG39. A total of 2,633 lipid molecules and 31 lipid subclasses were identified, mainly including thirteen kinds of glycerophospholipids (GP), eleven kinds of glycerolipids (GL), four kinds of sphingolipids (SP), two kinds of fatty acyls (FA) and one kind of sterol (ST). Among them JG35 had higher contents of diacylglycerols (DG) and ceramides (Cer), while triacylglycerols, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidic acid, sterol, fatty acyls and pardiolipin (TG, PE, PA, ST, FA and CL) were higher in JG39. Meantime, the correlation analysis of lipidomics and transcriptomics was used to map the main differential lipid metabolism pathways of foxtail millet. The results shown that a differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of FATA/B for the synthesis of FA was highly expressed in JG35, and the related genes for the synthesis DG (ACCase, KAS, HAD, KCS, LACS and GAPT), TG (DGAT and PDAT) and CL (CLS) were highly expressed in JG39. The results of this study will provide a theoretical basis for the future study of lipidomics, improvement of lipid quality directionally and breeding of idiosyncratic quality varieties in foxtail millet.

J	Shi, PJ; Gai, HQ; Li, Z				Shi, Peijun; Gai, Haoqi; Li, Zhi			Partitioned Soil Water Balance and Its Link With Water Uptake Strategy Under Apple Trees in the Loess-Covered Region	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												It is important, but challenging, to partition soil water balance (SWB) to understand the impacts of afforestation on soil hydrological processes. This study will investigate the partitioning of SWB by combining stable and radioactive water isotopes to quantify the effects of afforestation, and analyze the mechanism by which SWB changes through identifying the water uptake strategies of apple trees of 18 and 26 years old (A18 and A26). Compared to the reference farmland, apple orchards significantly increased evapotranspiration (ET) by 5%-10%, which in turn decreased soil water storage and deep drainage by 5%-14% and 50%-95%, respectively. Further, the partitioning of ET showed that apple tree planting increased transpiration by 15%-28% but decreased evaporation by 17%-30%. The above change in SWB appeared to be closely related to plant water uptake strategies. The apple trees shifted their water source from shallow (0-2 m) to deep soils (below 2 m), utilizing approximately 62% of deep soil water in the late growing season. In particular, 23% of source water may come from soil water older than 50 years. The older apple trees tended to extract more water from deeper soils (45% for A26 vs. 38% for A18). Therefore, the soil water deficit was the cumulative effects of root water uptake. The methods for SWB partitioning provides technical support for similar studies, and the findings are helpful to better understand the hydrological processes in the thick loess deposition.

In this study, the water sources from RRS and three soil layers, the predawn leaf water potential (psi(pd)), the midday leaf water potential (psi(m)), the gradient of leaf water potential (psi(pd)-psi(m)), and the plant transpiration in response to rainfall pulses were analyzed for two dominant tree species, Hippophae rhamnoides subsp. sinensis and Populus tomentosa, in pure and mixed plantations during the growing period (June-September). Mixed afforestation significantly enhanced psi(pd)-psi(m), RRS uptake proportion (RUP), and the relative response of daily normalized sap flow (SFR) and reduced the water source proportion from the deep soil layer (100-200 cm) for both species (P<0.05). In pure and mixed plantations, the large psi(pd)-psi(m) was consistent with high SFR for H. rhamnoides and the small psi(pd)-psi(m) was consistent with low SFR for P. tomentosa in response to rainfall pulses. Therefore, H. rhamnoides and P. tomentosa exhibited anisohydric and isohydric behavior, respectively, and the former plant species was more sensitive to rainfall pulses than P. tomentosa. Furthermore, in pure plantations, the SFR was significantly affected by RUP and psi(pd)-psi(m) for H. rhamnoides and significantly influenced by psi(pd)-psi(m) for P. tomentosa (P<0.05). However, the SFR was significantly influenced by RUP and psi(pd)-psi(m) for both species in the mixed plantation. These results indicate that mixed afforestation enhanced the influence of RRS uptake on plant transpiration for these different rainfall-pulse-sensitive plants. This study provides insights into suitable plantation species selection and management considering the link between RRS uptake and plant transpiration in water-limited regions.					li, yan/ITU-9719-2023; sun, chen/JCP-0396-2023; Wang, Yining/JQW-2010-2023; Zhang, Xiaoyue/JFS-9880-2023														1027-5606	1607-7938				OCT 11	2022	26	19					4995	5013		10.5194/hess-26-4995-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-4995-2022													WOS:000865762400001
J	Pattathal, VA; Karnieli, A				Pattathal, Arun, V; Karnieli, Arnon			Deep feature learning and latent space encoding for crop phenology analysis	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS												The high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions of the Vegetation and Environment monitoring New Micro-Satellite (VEN mu S) satellite data facilitate field-level phenological analysis of crops. This study proposes deep learning (DL) based approaches to resolve the issues prevalent in crop phenology-based fingerprint estimation at field-level using VEN mu S satellite data. An encoder-decoder-based framework, called piece-wise kernel encoding network (PKNet), is proposed for missing data imputation of the vegetation index (VI) curves derived from time-series image data. PKNet adopts interpolation-based convolution, dynamic time wrapping (DTW) based layer formulation, and imputation-specific constraints for optimal smoothing of the irregularly sampled VI curves. Besides, PKNet learns kernel parameters dynamically. A variational encoding framework called a dynamic-projection-based generalization network (DPGNet), is proposed to generalize the pixel-level VI curves to synthesize a representative VI curve for a given field. DPGNet is more effective than the use of multiple moments as it is resilient to outliers and learns normally distributed latent space with a small number of samples. The current research also proposes a classifier, called dynamic time wrapping based capsule network (DTCapsNet), which learns a discriminative latent space and accurately models the VI curve features. The DTCapsNet considers the time-series nature of the input using DTW-based convolution layers. The feature characterization improves generalizability and gives good results, even with a limited number of training samples. Experiments using the ground truth information and satellite images, acquired over two farms in Israel, illustrate that the proposed frameworks give better results than the commonly-used existing approaches.

Genome analyses reveal population structure and a purple stigma color gene candidate in finger millet	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Finger millet is a key food security crop widely grown in eastern Africa, India and Nepal. Long considered a 'poor man's crop', finger millet has regained attention over the past decade for its climate resilience and the nutritional qualities of its grain. To bring finger millet breeding into the 21(st) century, here we present the assembly and annotation of a chromosome-scale reference genome. We show that this similar to 1.3 million years old allotetraploid has a high level of homoeologous gene retention and lacks subgenome dominance. Population structure is mainly driven by the differential presence of large wild segments in the pericentromeric regions of several chromosomes. Trait mapping, followed by variant analysis of gene candidates, reveals that loss of purple coloration of anthers and stigma is associated with loss-of-function mutations in the finger millet orthologs of the maize R1/B1 and Arabidopsis GL3/EGL3 anthocyanin regulatory genes. Proanthocyanidin production in seed is not affected by these gene knockouts.					song, bo/JQJ-0093-2023; Zhang, Yunyi/JHS-3626-2023	Pendergast, Thomas/0000-0001-5681-9662														2041-1723				JUN 21	2023	14	1							3694	10.1038/s41467-023-38915-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38915-6								37344528					WOS:001012502600014

Understanding the contributions of climate change and human activities, such as vegetation restoration and water consumption, to surface water resource reduction has become urgent and very important for future regional planning. Here, we use attribution approaches to explore the effects of climate change and human activities on run-off over the past six decades. The results showed that the observed annual run-off at Tongguan station, which is located within the mainstream of the Yellow River, exhibited a significant decreasing trend of -0.69 mm year(-1) (p < .01) and varied from -0.28 to -1.46 mm year(-1) (p < .01) in the eight selected tributaries from 1960 to 2015. Two relatively abrupt changes in the double mass curves occurred around 1979 and 1999; compared with Period 1 (P1; 1960-1979), the average catchment run-off decreased 32% during Period 2 (P2; 1980-1999) and up to 49% during Period 3 (P3; 2000-2015). We calculated that approximately 29% of the reduction in the run-off during P2 and 18% during P3 were attributed to climate change. Increased surface water consumption resulted in effective run-off reduction, with relative contributions of approximately 27% and 28% during P2 and P3, respectively. With the implementation of the "Grain-for-Green" project, the vegetation coverage rapidly increased from 36% in P1 to 52% in P3 and reduced run-off by 35% during P3. These findings explain the run-off reduction and benefit water resource management in the middle reaches of the Yellow River basin.					; Gao, Peng/K-7487-2014	Zhao, Guangju/0000-0002-4233-9403; Yang, Xiaonan/0000-0002-7401-606X; Gao, Peng/0000-0002-4723-4256; Zhao, Guangju/0000-0001-7756-4494													0885-6087	1099-1085				APR 15	2020	34	8					1906	1919		10.1002/hyp.13702	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13702		FEB 2020											WOS:000511021500001

A field experiment was conducted during the growing seasons (May to September) of 2013-2016 on the Loess Plateau of China to investigate the characteristics of T in apple (Malus domestica, cv. Fuji) orchards of different ages at multiple temporal scales. The results indicated that tree age clearly influenced T for the young (8-year-old) and old (18-year-old) apple orchards. Transpiration was consistently higher in the old than the young orchard at the same time scales (p < 0.05). At the monthly scale, T was not significantly correlated with leaf area index (LAI) or soil relative extractable water (REW) for either orchard. Average ratios of T to P for the four years were 37.7% and 50.2% for the young and old orchards, respectively. These results identified that trees age should be considered when evaluating T and sustainably developing revegetation activities on the Loess Plateau and in other similar regions.

Plant sulfite oxidase (SO) is a molybdo-enzyme that oxidizes excess SO2/sulfite into non-toxic sulfate. The effect of toxic sulfite on leaves and fruits was studied in tomato plants with different SO expression: wild-type, SO overexpression (OE) and SO RNA interference (Ri). Sulfite-dipped ripe-fruits and sulfite treated leaf discs of Ri plants impaired in SO activity were more susceptible, whereas OE plants were more resistant, as revealed by remaining chlorophyll and tissue damage levels. Application of molybdenum further enhanced the tolerance of leaf discs to sulfite by enhancing SO activity in OE lines, but not in wild-type or Ri plants. Notably, incubation with tungsten, the molybdenum antagonist, overturned the effect of molybdenum spray in OE plants, revealed by remaining chlorophyll content and SO activity. The results indicate that SO in tomato leaves and ripe fruits determines the resistance to sulfite and the application of molybdenum enhances sulfite resistance in OE plants by increasing SO activity. Overall, the results suggest that SO overexpression can be employed, with or without molybdenum application, for developing fruit and vegetable crops tolerant to sulfite/SO2 containing pre- and postharvest treatments.

The use of organic amendments in organic farming not only supply nutrients but also have the potential to contribute to soil carbon sequestration. Carbon storage and various soil organic pools are affected differently by various crops and production systems. A study was conducted with three crops (sunflower, pigeonpea, and greengram) under three production systems (control, organic and integrated) to assess the effect on soil C stocks, carbon sequestration potential, and crop yield. After seven years of experiment, pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.) cultivation improved soil bulk density, porosity and water holding capacity compared to greengram [Vigna radiata (L) Wilczek] and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). Furthermore, plots under pigeonpea cultivation being on par with greengram had 15.6% higher total C (113.52 Mg C ha(-1)), 14% higher easily oxidizable organic C (17.5 Mg C ha(-1)) and C sequestration rate of 1.22 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) compared to sunflower. Among the three production systems, plots under organic management had significantly lower bulk density and higher water holding capacity and porosity at all of the profile depths compared to integrated production system and control. Similarly, organic production system being on par with integrated production system improved the easily oxidizable, oxidizable and weakly oxidizable organic C fractions at different soil depths compared to control. The C sequestration rate ranged from 0.21 to 0.85 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in organic production systems compared to negligible rate (0.01-0.04 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) in the plots under control. On average, integrated production system being on par with organic management recorded significantly higher pigeonpea equivalent seed yield (886 kg ha(-1)) compared to control (792 kg ha(-1)). These results suggest the potential of organic production system in improving soil properties, C sequestration, and crop yields in semiarid rainfed areas.

The Shaker K+ channel protein family is involved in plant K+ uptake and distribution. Foxtail millet (Setaria italica), as an important crop, has strong tolerance and adaptability to abiotic stresses. However, no systematic study focused on the Shaker K+ channel family in foxtail millet. Here, ten Shaker K+ channel genes in foxtail millet were identified and divided into five groups through phylogenetic analysis. Gene structures, chromosome locations, cis-acting regulatory elements in promoter, and post-translation modification sites of Shaker K+ channels were analyzed. In silico analysis of transcript level demonstrated that the expression of Shaker K+ channel genes was tissue or developmental stage specific. The transcription levels of Shaker K+ channel genes in foxtail millet under different abiotic stresses (cold, heat, NaCl, and PEG) and phytohormones (6-BA, BR, MJ, IAA, NAA, GA3, SA, and ABA) treatments at 0, 12, and 24 h were detected by qRT-PCR. The results showed that SiAKT1, SiKAT3, SiGORK, and SiSKOR were worth further research due to their significant responses after most treatments. The yeast complementation assay verified the inward K+ transport activities of detectable Shaker K+ channels. Finally, we found interactions between SiKAT2 and SiSNARE proteins. Compared to research in Arabidopsis, our results showed a difference in SYP121 related Shaker K+ channel regulation mechanism in foxtail millet. Our results indicate that Shaker K+ channels play important roles in foxtail millet and provide theoretical support for further exploring the K+ absorption mechanism of foxtail millet under abiotic stress.						zhang, ben/0000-0003-4473-9184													1664-462X					JUN 9	2022	13								907635	10.3389/fpls.2022.907635	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.907635								35755660					WOS:000814868000001

MH1 responded differently to chilling and flooding according to various physiological parameters and antioxidant enzymes. Flooding led to an increase in ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity in both roots and leaves, while chilling did not affect APX activity. The full length DaAPX ORF sequence from MH1 (750 bp) was then cloned. Phylogenetic analysis showed that plant cytosolic APXs into four major clusters and DaAPX was closely related to Oncidium. The DaAPX gene driven by a 35S promoter was transferred into Arabidopsis. The gene expression and enzyme activity of APX in the DaAPX transgenic lines 1-3 were significantly higher than in wild type (WT) plants. Compared to WT plants, seedling growth characteristics were significantly better in all transgenic lines under chilling, flooding, and oxidative stresses, indicating that the overexpression of DaAPX in Arabidopsis enhanced tolerance to several abiotic stresses. MH1 plants supplied with H2O2 presented an increase in the activity of APX leading to enhanced tolerance to chilling. Functional characterization of the APX gene should improve our understanding of the chilling- and flood-response mechanism in the yam.

However, the constituents of epidermal wax and the regulatory mechanism of their biosynthesis in wheat have not been fully understood. Wheat varieties with different wax content, Jinmai47 and Jinmai84, were selected to comparatively analyze their waxy components and genetic characteristics, using a combination of lipidomic, transcriptomic, and BSA-Wheat 660K chip analysis. Through lipidomic analysis, 1287 lipid molecules were identified representing 31 lipid subclasses. Among these, Diacylglycerols (DG), (O-acyl)-omega-hydroxy fatty acids (OAHFA), wax ester (WE), Triacylglycerols (TG), and Monoradylglycerols (MG) accounted for 96.4% of the total lipids in Jinmai84 and 94.5% in Jinmai47. DG, OAHFA, and WE were higher in Jinmai84 than in Jinmai47 with the content of OAHFA 2.88-fold greater and DG 1.66-fold greater. Transcriptome sequence and bioinformatics analysis revealed 63 differentially expressed genes related to wax biosynthesis. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found to be involved with the OAHFA, DG, and MG of synthesis pathways, which enriched the wax metabolism pathway. Non-glaucous and glaucous bulks from a mapping population were used to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) via 660K chip analysis. Two loci centered on chromosomes 2D and 4B were detected and the locus on 4B is likely novel. These data improve understanding of complex lipid metabolism for cuticular wax biosynthesis in wheat and lay the foundation for future detailed investigation of mechanisms regulating wax metabolism.																			1664-462X					NOV 24	2021	12								794878	10.3389/fpls.2021.794878	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.794878								34899814					WOS:000738700300001

Hence, different integrated watershed management practices were introduced in the last few years to avert the problem. Currently, most of these practices are phased out. However, the status and challenges of these practices after phase-out are not well documented and required scientific research. On-field measurement from nine sample plots having a size of each 50 m*50 m at 200 m interval was conducted to assess the status and challenges of these practices. Results of the assessment showed that physical soil and water conservation structures were deteriorated by 47-64% after IWM project phased out. The key problems were lack of periodic maintenance, and limited support by biological conservation measures. The study results suggest that Watershed technologies are highly challenged after project phase-out. Hence, integration among the community, government and non-governmental organizations are needed to sustainably manage these resources.

To realize efficient phosphate removal from aqueous solution, an easily separable magnetic (Fe3O4) Caragana korshinskii biochar/Mg-Al layered double hydroxide composite (denoted as FCB/MAC) was synthesized via two-step electro-assisted modification for the first time. Subsequently, the physical and chemical properties of FCB/MAC were characterized. Furthermore, the sorption mechanism for phosphate removal was investigated in detail. The results indicated that Fe3O4 and the Mg-Al layered double hydroxide were successfully embedded in the biochar matrix. Moreover, FCB/MAC exhibited a high phosphate adsorption capacity and excellent magnetic properties for easy recovery. The maximum phosphate sorption capacity of FCB/MAC was 252.88 mg g(-1), which is much higher than the capacities of most magnetic phosphate adsorbents. In addition, the adsorption kinetics and isotherms indicated that phosphate adsorption by FCB/MAC was controlled by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm model. The phosphate adsorption mechanism involves anion exchange, electrostatic attraction, and ligand exchange. After five adsorption-desorption cycles, the phosphate adsorption capacity of FCB/MAC was 25.71 mg g(-1) with 51.43% removal efficiency and high recyclability. Thus, the composite prepared in this study is a promising adsorbent for phosphate removal from aqueous solution, and this work provides an excellent reference for constructing novel biochar-based phosphate adsorbents.

Understanding changes in soil moisture and temperature depending on rainfall and air temperature is necessary to develop application models for agriculture 4.0. A hypothesis was adopted assuming that the dynamics of soil moisture and its thermal properties will depend on the technology of cultivation. Hence, the aim of the research was to learn the dynamics of soil moisture and temperature during a growing season using strip and conventional tillage. Soil moisture was monitored using TDR probes in the row and inter-row of winter barley using plowing and strip-till techniques. Soil temperature was also monitored. Measurements were made every 5 min. In the most important period for the growth and development of barley vegetation, the soil in the strip-till was characterized by greater moisture (3.6% v/v on average) and greater stability than was the case with plowing. The soil in the strip-till was cooler (an average of 0.64 degrees C), but more stable than in plowing-temporary temperature differences in ST vs. PT reached even more than 5 degrees C. Strip-till therefore mitigates weather extremes to a greater extent than plowing.

J	Li, GQ; Huang, JH				Li, Guoqing; Huang, Jinghua			Climatic Niche of Vegetation Greenness Is Likely to Be Conservative in Degraded Land	LAND												Satellite data have been widely used to study changes in vegetation greenness in geographical space; however, this change is rarely considered in climatic space. Here, the climatic niche dynamics of vegetation greenness, represented by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), was quantified in the climate space of the Loess Plateau, a piece of degraded land greening significantly from 2000 to 2018. The niche similarity test was used to examine the niche conservatism of vegetation greenness during the 19 years of restoration. The results show that the climate niche of vegetation greenness is always more similar than expected. The stability niche occupied most parts (83-98%) of their climatic niche, and niche overlap reached 0.52-0.69. Climate niche conservatism suggests that potential greenness constructed by statistical methods could be used as a criterion or baseline for ecosystem function restoration on the Loess Plateau. The study also suggests that the integrated niche similarity test in decision-making for restoration of degraded land will clarify our understanding of the climatic niche dynamics of vegetation greenness and the making of forecasts.

Although calcium (Ca) is an important second messenger involved in numerous complex, abiotic stress-induced signaling pathways, it remains unclear how exogenous calcium mediates cellular signaling to promote plant drought resistance. We investigated the effects of calcium on the water balance and hydraulic properties in maize seedlings (Zea mays L.) under osmotic stress simulated by 10% (m/v) PEG-6000 in a hydroponic culture. The osmotic stress dramatically decreased the photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, leaf water content, and root water absorption. However, the short-term (2 h) and long-term (10 d) exogenous Ca2+ (CaCl2: 10 mM) treatments had different effects on the maize gas exchange parameters and leaf water status. The short-term treatment improved the leaf transpiration by inhibiting the abscisic acid (ABA) synthesis and accumulation in the leaves, generating a stronger transpiration pull and enhancing the root water absorption and axial flow path water transport by increasing the root hydraulic conductance to relieve the osmotic stress-induced inhibition. The long-term treatment induced the ABA and H2O2 accumulation in the roots and leaves. Under osmotic stress, the accumulation of ABA, H2O2, and Ca2+ rapidly repressed the transpiration and enhanced the radial flow path water transport, decreasing the water loss and improving the stress tolerance. These insights suggest a role for a judicious use of Ca fertilizer in reducing the adverse effects of drought on agricultural production.																				2223-7747				MAY 16	2023	12	10							1999	10.3390/plants12101999	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants12101999								37653916					WOS:000997405500001

Long-term soil erosion has led to the retreat of gullies and the rapid reduction of fertile arable land, which has further decreased agricultural production. In this study, we chose the Malian River basin to analyze the temporal and spatial variation of its runoff and sediment load, as well as the potential causes. The annual runoff and sediment load at six hydrological stations in the study area were collected for the period between 1960 and 2016. The Mann-Kendall and Pettitt tests were respectively applied to detect temporal variations and abrupt changes in the runoff and sediment loads. The results showed that an abrupt change in the runoff and sediment loads occurred in 2003. The average annual runoff in the Malian River was 4.42 x 10(8) m(3) yr(-1) from 1960 to 2002, and decreased to 3.32 x 10(8) m(3) yr(-1) in 2003-2016. The average annual sediment load was 1.27 x 10(8) t yr(-1) in 1960-2002, and decreased to 0.65 x 10(8) t yr(-1) in 2003-2016. The spatial patterns in the sediment load suggested that the Hongde sub-basin contributed a higher sediment count to the Malian River, which may require additional attention for soil and water conservation in the future. Anthropogenic activities significantly affected runoff and sediment load reduction according to the double-mass curve method, accounting for 90.7% and 78.7%, respectively, whereas rainfall changes were 9.3% and 21.3%, respectively. As such, the present study analyzed the loessial tableland runoff and sediment load characteristics of the Malian River basin for soil and water erosion management.

The alternate irrigation with saline water at different growth stages is still not well understood. Therefore, field trials were conducted during 2015-2018 in the NCP to investigate whether alternate irrigation is practicable for winter wheat production. The treatments comprised rain-fed cultivation (NI), fresh and saline water irrigation (FS), saline and fresh water irrigation (SF), saline water irrigation (SS) and fresh water irrigation (FF). The results showed that the grain yield was increased by 20% under SF and FS treatments compared to NI, while a minor decrease of 2% in grain yield was observed compared with FF treatment. The increased soil salinity and risk of long-term salt accumulation in the soil due to alternate irrigation during peak dry periods was insignificant due to leaching of salts from crop root zone during monsoon season. Although Na+ concentration in the leaves increased with saline irrigation, resulting in significantly lower K+:Na+ ratio in the leaves, the Na+ and K+ concentrations in the roots and grains were not affected. In conclusion, the alternate irrigation for winter wheat is a most promising option to harvest more yield and save fresh water resources.

J	Wang, D; Wang, L				Wang, Di; Wang, Li			Canopy interception of apple orchards should not be ignored when assessing evapotranspiration partitioning on the Loess Plateau in China	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Canopy interception is one of the most important processes in an ecosystem, but it is still neglected when assessing evapotranspiration (ET) partitioning in apple orchards on the Loess Plateau in China. To explore the importance of canopy interception, we monitored two neighbouring apple orchards on the Loess Plateau in China, one 8-year-old and the other 18-years old at the start of the study, from May to September for four consecutive years (2013-2016). We measured parameters of canopy interception (I) including precipitation, throughfall, stemflow, leaf area index, transpiration (T), and soil evaporation (S) to quantify ET. The importance of canopy interception was then assessed by comparing the relationship between water supply (precipitation) and water demand (ET), calculated with and without considering canopy interception (T + S and T + S + I, respectively). Tree age clearly influenced canopy interception, as estimates of annual canopy interception during the study years in the younger and older orchards amounted to 22.2-29.4 mm and 26.8-39.9 mm, respectively. Daily incident rainfall and rainfall intensity in both orchards were significantly positively correlated with daily canopy interception in each year. The relationship between annual precipitation and annual ET (calculated with and without consideration of canopy interception) in the younger orchard differed during 2015 and 2016. Ignoring canopy interception would result in underestimation of annual ET in both apple orchards and hence incorrect evaluation of the relationship between water supply and water demand, particularly for the younger orchard during 2015 and 2016. Thus, for a complete understanding of water consumption in apple orchards in this and similar regions, canopy interception should not be ignored when assessing ET partitioning.

Development of a lucerne model in APSIM next generation: 2 canopy expansion and light interception of genotypes with different fall dormancy ratings	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												Lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) canopy expansion, as quantified by leaf area index (LAI), is the crop process that determines the amount of intercepted total radiation during each regrowth cycle. A challenge is to capture seasonal changes of canopy expansion rate in response to the environment. This research integrates parameters and functions of lucerne canopy expansion into the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) next generation (APSIM NextGen) model (LeafArea module) to simulate canopy expansion and light interception. Over 20 years of detailed field experimental datasets, with multiple treatments, from Lincoln University were used for model development. Functions derived from a fall dormancy (FD) 5 rated genotype were grown under an industry standard defoliation treatment to parametrize the model. These functions were tested further using genotypes with an FD2 or FD10 rating under longer and shorter defoliation regimes, all under irrigated conditions. The APSIM NextGen lucerne model predicted the LAI expansion pattern in each growth cycle as a double sigmoid curve requiring functions that define the lag phase, basal bud initiation, the linear leaf area expansion rate (LAER; m2 m-2 degrees Cd), and canopy senescence which represents the loss of LAI over time. LAI was well predicted for experiments under the standard (42-day) and long (84 day) defoliation treatments for FD5, with NashSutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.61 and 0.55. However, the derived parameters and functions overestimated LAI under an extreme short defoliation treatment (28-day), NSE values ranged from 0.38 to 0.78. LAER was lower for the short-defoliation intervals (28-day), probably due to a depletion of carbon and nitrogen reverses in perennial organs. For FD2 and FD10, different LAER functions were generated from field observed data and used to improve simulation agreement. There was fair agreement for the 84-day treatment (NSE of 0.32) and the 42-day treatment (NSE of 0.38), but poor agreement for the 28-day treatment for FD10 (NSE = -0.88). The estimated extinction coefficient (k) was the same for seedling and regrowth crops, and consistent across defoliation treatments and FD classes. With the LeafArea module and k value, the APSIM NextGen lucerne model can now estimate daily LAI and intercepted radiation. Future model development includes validating the LeafArea module in different environments. However, a more mechanistic model approach is required to link canopy expansion to carbon and nitrogen reserves in lucerne plants that experience intense defoliation.

R. Br.)	AGRICULTURE-BASEL												Three-way top-cross hybrids of pearl millet were evaluated along with a popular single- cross check hybrid (PAC 981) for forage yield and quality traits under a multi-cut (three cuts) system across multiple years, seasons and sites in India. Total green forage yield (TGFY) varied from 36 to 53 t ha(-1), and two hybrids outyielded the check hybrid for both total dry forage yield (TDFY) and forage quality (CP; Crude protein, and IVOMD; In vitro organic matter digestibility) traits. A set of promising three-way top-cross hybrids evaluated along with a set of promising open-pollinated varieties (OPVs) and top-cross hybrids for forage-related traits over two years under a multi-cut system revealed that the mean TDFY of three-way top-cross hybrids was higher than the mean TDFY of top-cross hybrids, followed by OPVs. Also, three-way top-cross hybrids had higher/or at par forage quality traits such as CP and IVOMD in comparison to other types of cultivars. TDFY had no correlation with CP and IVOMD across cuts in three-way top-cross hybrids, indicating that forage quantity and quality traits can be improved independently of each other. Overall, three-way top-cross hybrids were found to be a better pearl millet cultivar option than other types of cultivars.

Bedload transport and dune bedforms characteristics in sand-bed rivers supplying a retreating beach of the northern Adriatic Sea (Italy)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study Region: The coast of the Emilia-Romagna Region in northern Italy consists of about 210 km of sandy beaches that have been attracting tourists for decades. Since the 1980s, erosion processes resulted in a remarkable beach retreat, notwithstanding the construction of several protections works. Study Focus: In 2005-2006 and 2017-2020, 30 floods of two small rivers feeding the beaches of Ravenna, Fiumi Uniti and Savio, were monitored and bedload was measured with a Helly-Smith sampler. Riverbed bathymetric surveys were carried out after some selected floods to investigate the occurrence and geometry of alluvial bedforms. The dune migration method was also used to calculate bedload. Results provided by this method are very encouraging. New Hydrological insights for the Region: To the authors knowledge, this field investigation on the bedload transport of small coastal rivers is the first one of this kind in the Adriatic and provides the regional land managers with a useful tool to predict the bedload yield for future scientifically based interventions, and hopefully successful, beach protection works. The bedload data indicate a higher variability of bedload for discharges lower than bankfull flow, whereas a stronger control of discharge is evident for larger floods. Though the bedload of the study rivers proved to be higher than in the largest river of the Region, it resulted rather low and witnesses sediment supply-limited conditions.

Rajendranagar (Telangana), Bengaluru (Karnataka), Rahuri (Maharashtra), Raipur (Chhattisgarh) and Ludhiana (Punjab) was made using advanced statistical method of support vector regression (SVR) with its accuracy compared with conventional multiple linear regression (MLR) model. Comparisons of early blight severity for mean and maximum severity levels across seasons for each location was carried out using Duncan's Multiple Range Test (DMRT). Early blight mean and maximum severity levels were in order. Bengaluru (KA) > Rajendranagar (Ts) > Rahuri (MH) > Raipur (CG) > Ludhiana (PB). Ludhiana (PB) had nil incidence during 2015 and not greater than 5% of either mean or maximum severity in any season. Both minimum temperature and morning relative humidity of one and two lagged weeks had negative and positive influence respectively, on mean and maximum severity of early blight at Rajendranagar (TS), Bengaluru (KA) and Rahuri (MH), which had higher blight severity over Raipur (CG) and Ludhiana (PB). MLR indicated 22-56% and 21-61% of variability with respect to mean and maximum severity of early blight due to weather factors that varied with locations. SVR predicted early blight severity nearer to actual values over MLR in terms of goodness of fit as well as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

This study was performed to quantify the effects of near-soil-surface factors on runoff and sediment under natural rainfall events on grasslands dominated by Bothriochloa ischaemum (Linn.) Keng (BI grassland) and Artemisia gmelinii Thunb. (AG grassland) in two typical watersheds on the Loess Plateau, China in 2018. By successive removal of the plant canopy, litter, biological soil crusts (BSCs) and plant roots, we established five treatments including plant roots, plant roots+BSCs, plant roots+BSCs+litter, intact grassland and bare land in each grassland type. In total, twenty runoff plots (5 mx3 m) with similar slopes and aspects were constructed in the two types of grasslands. Results showed that plant canopy, litter and roots reduced runoff, while BSCs, which swelled in the presence of water, increased runoff. In contrast, all of these factors reduced sediment yield. In addition, the reductions in runoff and sediment yield increased with I-30 (maximum 30-min rainfall intensity) for each vegetation near-soil-surface factor except for BSCs. Among these factors, plant canopy had the largest contribution to runoff reduction, accounting for 48.8% and 39.9% in the BI and AG grasslands, respectively. The contributions of these vegetation near-soil-surface factors to sediment yield reduction were similar (21.3%-29.9%) in the two types of grasslands except for BSCs in the AG grassland (10.3%). The total reduction in runoff in the BI grassland (70.8%) was greater than that in the AG grassland (53.1%), while the reduction in sediment yield was almost the same in both grasslands (97.4% and 96.7%). In conclusion, according to the effects of different vegetation near-soil-surface factors on runoff and sediment production, our results may provide more complete insight and scientific basis into the effects of various vegetation related factors in controlling soil erosion.

Mapping Tree Height in Burkina Faso Parklands with TanDEM-X	REMOTE SENSING												Mapping of tree height is of great importance for management, planning, and research related to agroforestry parklands in Africa. In this paper, we investigate the potential of spotlight-mode data from the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) satellite system TanDEM-X (TDM) for mapping of tree height in Sapone, Burkina Faso, a test site characterised by a low average canopy cover (similar to 15%) and a mean tree height of 9.0 m. Seven TDM acquisitions from January-April 2018 are used jointly to create high-resolution (similar to 3 m) maps of interferometric phase height and mean canopy elevation, the latter derived using a new, model-based processing approach compensating for some effects of the side-looking geometry of SAR. Compared with phase height, mean canopy elevation provides a more accurate representation of tree height variations, a better tree positioning accuracy, and better tree height estimation performance when assessed using 915 trees inventoried in situ and representing 15 different species/genera. We observe and discuss two bias effects, and we use empirical models to compensate for these effects. The best-performing model using only TDM data provides tree height estimates with a standard error (SE) of 2.8 m (31% of the average height) and a correlation coefficient of 75%. The estimation performance is further improved when TDM height data are combined with in situ measurements; this is a promising result in view of future synergies with other remote sensing techniques or ground measurement-supported monitoring of well-known trees.

The results show that under the same drip tape layout, the lower the drip emitter flow rate, the more upright the shape of wetted soil volume. The maximum vertical and horizontal water transport distance under NL treatment was higher than that under NH, EH, and EL treatments. After surface drip fertigation, nitrate nitrogen accumulated near and at the edge of the wetted soil volume. In 2020, under NL treatment, nitrate nitrogen transported to a 55 cm soil layer, which was 22.22%, 71.42%, and 57.14% deeper than that under NH, EH, and EL treatments, respectively. In 2021, nitrate nitrogen could transport to a 60 cm soil layer in both NL and NH treatments. The maximum concentration of ammonium nitrogen was nearby the emitter. Under NL treatment, ammonium nitrogen was transported to 48 and 60 cm soil layers below the emitter in 2020 and 2021, respectively, which was deeper than that observed under NH, EH, and EL treatments. The soil inorganic nitrogen residue of the NL was lower than that of the NH, EH, and EL treatments. Compared with NH, EH, and EL treatments, the two-year maize yield under NL treatment increased by 11.09%, 13.47%, and 8.66% on average, respectively. NL treatment exhibited the highest water use efficiency and nitrogen fertilizer productivity. Therefore, NL treatment (one drip tape serving for two rows with 1.3 L/h flow rate) could promote the absorption of water and nutrients, reduce inorganic nitrogen residue, and to obtain high maize yield in sandy tidal soil.																				2073-4395				NOV	2023	13	11							2689	10.3390/agronomy13112689	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13112689													WOS:001120989900001

Spatial and temporal pattern of deficient Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR): impact on <i>Kharif</i> (summer monsoon) food grain production in India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY												Despite a significant increasing trend in historical food grain production (FGP) in India, deficient Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) often causes a reduction in FGP. The present study was carried out to understand temporal and spatial variations in deficient rainfall (drought) and their impact on national and regional FGP of India. Long-term (1901-2020) percentage departure in rainfall and drought areas over the country showed nonsignificant and significant trends, respectively. Subdivisional rainfall showed significant decreasing and increasing trends in 4 and 5 subdivisions, respectively. Drought years of high frequency (once in 3-4 years) and 4 to 5 consecutive drought years (once in 120 years) occurred in northwest and western subdivisions of India. Departure in de-trended production of All India Kharif food grains from its normal (DDP) showed significant quadratic relationship with departure in ISMR from its normal (DRF). Besides the quadratic equation, another multiple regression model taking de-trended crop area, DRF, and drought area as predictor variables was developed for predicting DDP. Both these models, with high R-2 (0.8-0.88) between observed and predicted data and low RMSE (2.6-2.7%), can be employed for advanced estimation of DDP of the country and for taking country-level policy decisions by the Indian Government. For the first time, models were formulated to estimate state-wise departure in FGP (DP). In these models, novel indices viz., (i) rainfall departure and irrigation index (RDII) and (ii) physical and socio-economic index (PSEI), were used as predictor variables. These models, with R-2 (0.71-0.75) and RMSE of 11.8-14.2(< SD of observed data), hold promise for advance estimation of production loss in states, useful for regional-level planning by the Government of India, and testing them in other countries.																			0020-7128	1432-1254				MAR	2023	67	3					485	501		10.1007/s00484-023-02428-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-023-02428-0		JAN 2023						36652001					WOS:000920206200002

However, limited information is available for addressing the effects of N input on SOC sequestration and discriminating between the differential effects on bulk soil and the rhizosphere. The aims of this study are to explore the responses of SOC fractions to different N addition levels and their potential environmental drivers. Materials and methods A 20-month pot experiment was conducted to investigate the responses of soil organic C (SOC) fractions to varying levels of N addition (0, 25, 50, 75, 100, and 150 kg N center dot ha(-1)center dot year(-1)) in rhizosphere and bulk soil by using a nylon mesh. The key roles of bacterial community composition and C-acquisition enzyme activities were also deciphered as the driver factors of SOC fractions. Results and discussion Carbon levels (i.e., particulate organic C (POC), light and heavy C fractions, dissolved organic C, and easily oxidizable organic C) in the rhizosphere increased with increasing N addition. Greater variation was observed in the response of POC to N addition, when compared to other SOC fractions, indicating relatively higher sensitivity of POC to elevated soil N levels. In the rhizosphere, N addition increased bacterial diversity and the activities of C-acquisition enzymes but only at lower levels (<= 50 kg N center dot ha(-1)center dot year(-1)). The effect of N addition on rhizospheric SOC was strongly associated with increased root biomass and inorganic N content. Meanwhile, in bulk soil, changes in SOC fractions were largely driven by soil NO3--N level. Conclusions The results of the present study indicate that N addition increases rhizospheric SOC content by regulating soil N levels and bacterial activities and highlight the differential responses of SOC fractions from rhizosphere and bulk soil to N addition, which will be helpful to understand the role of SOC sequestration in response to N deposition.

These methods of raw produce evaluation are slow and can result in procurement irregularities. The procurement delays combined with the lack of storage facilities lead to fungal contaminations and pose a serious threat to food safety in many regions. To address this gap, we investigated whether X-ray technology could be used for the rapid assessment of the key peanut qualities that are important for price estimation. Results We generated 1752 individual peanut pod 2D X-ray projections using a computed tomography (CT) system (CTportable160.90). Out of these projections we predicted the kernel weight and shell weight, which are important indicators of the produce price. Two methods for the feature prediction were tested: (i) X-ray image transformation (XRT) and (ii) a trained convolutional neural network (CNN). The prediction power of these methods was tested against the gravimetric measurements of kernel weight and shell weight in diverse peanut pod varieties(1). Both methods predicted the kernel mass with R-2 > 0.93 (XRT: R-2 = 0.93 and mean error estimate (MAE) = 0.17, CNN: R-2 = 0.95 and MAE = 0.14). While the shell weight was predicted more accurately by CNN (R-2 = 0.91, MAE = 0.09) compared to XRT (R-2 = 0.78; MAE = 0.08). Conclusion Our study demonstrated that the X-ray based system is a relevant technology option for the estimation of key peanut produce indicators (Figure 1). The obtained results justify further research to adapt the existing X-ray system for the rapid, accurate and objective peanut procurement process. Fast and accurate estimates of produce value are a necessary pre-requisite to avoid post-harvest losses due to fungal contamination and, at the same time, allow the fair payment to farmers. Additionally, the same technology could also assist crop improvement programs in selecting and developing peanut cultivars with enhanced economic value in a high-throughput manner by skipping the shelling of the pods completely. This study demonstrated the technical feasibility of the approach and is a first step to realize a technology-driven peanut production system transformation of the future.

Due to the decline in agricultural labor, the automatic and real-time acquisition of crop growth information will become a prominent issue for farms in the future. To address this problem, we focused on stereo vision and a regression convolutional neural network (CNN) in order to estimate buckwheat plant height. MobileNet V3 Small, NasNet Mobile, RegNet Y002, EfficientNet V2 B0, MobileNet V3 Large, NasNet Large, RegNet Y008, and EfficientNet V2 L were modified into regression CNNs. Through a five-fold cross-validation of the modeling data, the modified RegNet Y008 was selected as the optimal estimation model. Based on the depth and contour information of buckwheat depth image, the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), and mean relative error (MRE) when estimating plant height were 0.56 cm, 0.73 cm, 0.54 cm, and 1.7%, respectively. The coefficient of determination (R2) value between the estimated and measured results was 0.9994. Combined with the LabVIEW software development platform, this method can estimate buckwheat accurately, quickly, and automatically. This work contributes to the automatic management of farms.

J	Guo, MM; Wang, WL; Wang, TC; Wang, WX; Kang, HL				Guo, Mingming; Wang, Wenlong; Wang, Tianchao; Wang, Wenxin; Kang, Hongliang			Impacts of different vegetation restoration options on gully head soil resistance and soil erosion in loess tablelands	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Vegetation restoration is identified as an effective approach to control soil erosion and affects soil detachment and resistance to concentrated flow on the Loess Plateau. However, the effects of vegetation restoration at gully heads in loess-tableland remains unclear. This study was performed to investigate the effects of nine vegetation restoration types at gully heads on soil detachment rate (Dr) and soil resistance to concentrated flow (i.e. soil erodibility, K-r and critical shear stress, tau(c)). Undisturbed soil samples were collected from nine vegetation-restored lands and one slope cropland (as the control) and were subjected to a hydraulic flume to obtain Dr values of gully heads under six inflow discharges (0.5-3.5 L s(-1)). The results showed that the Dr values of nine revegetated gully heads were 77.11% to 95.81% less than that of slope cropland, and the grassland dominated by Cleistogenes caespitosa and the shrubland dominated by Hippophae rhamnoides had a relatively greater decrease in Dr than those of other seven restoration types. The Dr value of nine revegetated gully heads could be better simulated by stream power than by flow velocity and shear stress and was also significantly affected by soil disintegration rate (positively), soil bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, organic matter content, and water-stable aggregate stability (negatively). Additionally, roots with diameters of 0 to 0.5 mm showed a greater effect on Dr than those with larger diameters. Compared to cropland, the nine restored types reduced K-r by 76.26% to 94.26% and improved tau(c) by 1.51 to 4.68 times. The decrease in K-r and the increase in tau(c) were significantly affected by organic matter content, water-stable aggregate, mean weight diameter of aggregate and root mass density. The combination of grass species (Cleistogenes caespitosa) and shrub (Hippophae rhamnoides) could be considered the best vegetation restoration types for improving soil resistance of gully heads to concentrated flow.

The bias correction methods mostly highlight the target statistical parameters (e.g., mean and variance) for a target period, but perturb the simulated change trend and variability. In this study, we utilize a trend-preserving bias correc-tion method that can simultaneously consider the frequency and intensity of climatic variables to adjust the daily maximum and minimum temperature, and precipitation (Tmax, Tmin, and Pre) from CORDEX-EA regional climate models for the period of 2021-2050 over China. Results show that: (a) the bias correction method greatly improves the spatial patterns of simulated Tmax, Tmin, and Pre since the corrected data has higher correlation and smaller dif-ferences across the whole domain. The differences in mean Tmax, Tmin, and Pre between climate models and observations have been reduced from -4.5 +/- 6.41 degrees C, -2.06 +/- 0.58 degrees C, 177.25 +/- 51.55 mm before correction to 0.01 +/- 0.02 degrees C, -0.01 +/- 0.02 degrees C, -26.22 +/- 6.39 mm after correction, respec-tively. In addition, the simulated change trend and climate variability at all time scales are well preserved. (b) Spatially, the warming rates in the west would be higher than in the east, and they are larger under the most severe future emissions scenario (RCP8.5) relative to the low-mid emissions scenario (RCP4.5). The Pre change would mainly occur over east China with the signifi-cant upward trend.

Hypersensitive response (HR)-like cell death is often associated with excess ROS. However, how a calcium-dependent protein kinase (CPK) modulates this process remains elusive in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.). In the present study, we identified and characterized CPK6L from rapeseed as a novel regulator of ROS and cell death. The subcellular localization of BnaCPK6L was investigated through GFP and was found to be located at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Overexpression of the constitutively active BnaCPK6LCA resulted in significant accumulation of ROS and HR-like cell death than the full-length. A quantitative RT-PCR survey identified that the expression levels of a few ROS, cell death and defense-related marker genes were up-regulated upon BnaCPK6LCA expression. Mating-based split ubiquitin system (mbSUS) screening revealed that BnaCPK6L interacted with BnaRBOHD (Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homolog D), which was validated by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). An in vitro phosphorylation assay indicated that BnaCPK6L phosphorylated BnaRBOHD. Lastly, we also found that three 2C type protein phosphatases (PP2Cs) interacted with BnaCPK6L. Taken together, this study indicates that BnaCPK6L plays an important role in ROS and HR-like cell death through interacting with and phosphorylating RBOHD. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Effect of Different Land Configuration, Superabsorbent and Nutrient Management on Yield and Economics of Soybean (<i>Glycine max</i> L.)- Safflower (<i>Carthamus tinctorius</i>) Cropping System	LEGUME RESEARCH												Background: Oilseed crops are sources of fats and oils, which are essential for human diet, comprising about 40% of the calories in the diet of the average person safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) is a major rabi oilseed crop in the country. Like soybean its productivity is also very low as compared to the global average. Horizontal expansion to augment the food production is limited and the alternative way is to move on vertical growth by enhancing the productivity of the area. Therefore, production technology and management practices should be developed keeping in view all the above point, for efficient use of costly inputs, beside reduction in production cost, for instance residual effect of manures and fertilizers applied and nitrogen fixed by legumes can considerably bring down the production cost. Methods: A field experiment was carried out to study the performance of soybean-safflower cropping sequence under different land configuration and nutrient management. Treatment consists of eighteen treatment combinations comprising three land configuration (L1- flat beds, L2- ridges and furrow and L3- Broad bed furrow) and three superabsorbent levels (S1- 0 kg ha-1, S2- 2.5 kg ha-1 and S3- 5.0 kg ha-1) in main plot, two nutrient levels i.e., N1 -30:60:30 NPK kg ha-1 + 5 t FYM ha-1 and N2 -30:60:30:30 NPKS kg ha-1 + 20 kg ZnSO4 + 5 t FYM ha-1 to soybean and N1 -40:20:0 NPK kg ha-1 and N2 -30:15:0 NPK kg ha-1 to safflower during kharif and rabi seasons, respectively as sub plot treatments were assigned in a split plot design with three replications. Result: Broad bed furrows planting method with the application of 30:60:30:30 NPKS kg ha-1 + 20 kg ZnSO4 + 5 t FYM ha-1 to soybean and 40:20:0 NPK kg ha-1 to safflower during kharif and rabi seasons, respectively recorded significantly higher yield and yield attributes as well as net monetary returns but the applications of superabsorbent reordered non-significant effect during both the year of study.																			0250-5371					DEC	2022	45	12					1540	1546		10.18805/LR-4319	http://dx.doi.org/10.18805/LR-4319													WOS:000906826400012

Evaluating area-specific adaptation strategies for rainfed maize under future climates of India	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study investigates the spatio-temporal changes in maize yield under projected climate and identified the potential adaptation measures to reduce the negative impact. Future climate data derived from 30 general circulation models were used to assess the impact of future climate on yield in 16 major maize growing districts of India. DSSAT model was used to simulate maize yield and evaluate adaptation strategies during mid (2040-69) and end-centuries (207099) under RCP 4.5 and 8.5. Genetic coefficients were calibrated and validated for each of the study locations. The projected climate indicated a substantial increase in mean seasonal maximum (0.9-6.0 degrees C) and minimum temperatures (1.1-6.1 degrees C) in the future (the range denotes the lowest and highest change during all the four future scenarios). Without adaptation strategies, climate change could reduce maize yield in the range of 16% (Tumkur) to 46% (Jalandhar) under RCP 4.5 and 21% (Tumkur) to 80% (Jalandhar) under RCP 8.5. Only at Dharwad, the yield could remain slightly higher or the same compared to the baseline period (1980-2009). Six adaptation strategies were evaluated (delayed sowing, increase in fertilizer dose, supplemental irrigation, and their combinations) in which a combination of those was found to be effective in majority of the districts. District-specific adaptation strategies were identified for each of the future scenarios. The findings of this study will enable in planning adaptation strategies to minimize the negative impact of projected climate in major maize growing districts of India.

For grassland ecosystems, most grassland biomass is invested in the root system. Therefore, to determine the influence of root decomposition on soil microorganisms in different grassland species, an in-situ root decomposition experiment was conducted with two species (gramineous forage: Bothriochloa ischaemum and leguminous forage: Lespedeza davurica) over three decomposition times (90, 270 and 450 days). Total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in the roots of the two species decreased gradually. And L. davurica had higher soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) in the late stage. Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi and Acidobacteria were the dominant bacteria, and Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the dominant fungi in the two species. STN is the most important factor driving changes in soil microbial communities. The alpha diversity index of bacteria in both species showed an increasing trend, while in fungi, it decreased rapidly at the early stage and increased slightly at the late stage. Compared with the bacteria in B. ischaemum, L. davurica increased some submetabolic system pathway genes related to carbon cycle metabolism. FUNGuild revealed that saprotrophic fungi on the 90(th) day were significantly lower than those on the 270(th) and 450(th) days. Our results show that leguminous forages have better performance in improving SOC and STN, and microbial characteristics are also affected by species during root decomposition.					chen, yan/JRY-4645-2023; zhao, hang/JVM-8270-2024; Zhang, Chi/JSK-0744-2023	zhouping, shangguan/0000-0002-5815-6310; Fang, Yan/0000-0002-7351-0816													1085-3278	1099-145X				JUL 15	2023	34	11					3250	3261		10.1002/ldr.4680	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4680		MAR 2023											WOS:000956377300001

Therefore, the present study was designed to estimate the emission of GHGs from the livestock sector over the time period (2003/04-2017/18) and evaluate the mitigation potential using the global livestock environment assessment model (GLEAM). Both primary and secondary data sources were used to obtain data on livestock population, herd parameters, feeding practices, and manure management. The study revealed an increasing trend of GHG from 2003/04 to 2017/18, where the annual emission increased with an average 3.8 Mt carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) for all species and 3.3 Mt CO2-eq for cattle alone at national level. Though there is some variation between regions, methane (CH4) was the major gas emitted from ruminant production followed by nitrous oxide (N2O), however the emission of N2O was higher (> 70%) in poultry production. The emission intensity from chicken egg and meat, 1.8-3.3 and 2.2-7.2 kg CO2-eq/kg of product, respectively, was much lower than the emission intensity of meat from small ruminants (16.4-51.5 kg CO2-eq/kg of product) and cattle (34.2-148.2 kg CO2-eq/kg of product). Implementing the integrated mitigation approach has much pronounced reduction effect on GHG emissions as well as increasing the productivity of the livestock sector. Unless mitigation measures are taken, the sector's emission will increase over time. Thus, federal and regional governments, and partner organizations working in the sector need to give more attention and implement the initiatives identified in the Climate Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) strategy and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) recommendations to mitigate GHG emissions from the livestock sector.

J	Frenkel, I; Niv, A				Frenkel, Ido; Niv, Avi			Effect of Maintaining a Fixed Ambient Temperature on the Evaluation of Photovoltaic Device Performance	PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED												In this article, we analyze the photovoltaic effect while assuming a fixed ambient temperature and a varying system temperature rather than using the standard fixed system temperature-based approaches. We do so by complementing the photon rate balance equation (detailed balance, circuit model) with the power balance equation of the system. As a result, a simple approach capable of treating any photovoltaic system emerges. Accordingly, we study the potential-dependent current and temperature of solar cells and thermoradiative power generators. We show that the optimal band gap of a solar cell depends on its heat -transfer coefficient and that its efficiency may rise or fall as solar concentration increases, depending on its ability to dissipate heat. We also identify where the cell's efficiency and temperature turn from a conduc-tive and/or convective-dominated cooling regime to a radiative-dominated one. For the thermoradiative case, we show that its power decreases when heat intake is suppressed and study the degrading effect of nonradiative recombination on this power production scheme. The proposed model converges to the known fixed system temperature-based approaches when an infinite ability to transfer heat is considered.

Identifying the dominant controlling factors and quantifying the contribution of each factor would be helpful to sustain water and soil resources. China's Loess Plateau was taken as an example area to investigate the above issues since it is the most eroded region in the world, and its soil loss is being controlled by a large-scale revegetation program. We extended the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to large-scale erosion estimation with the aid of GIS for the period of 1986-2015, analyzed the relationship between erosion and controlling factors by correlation and wavelet coherence analysis, and quantified the contribution of each factor to erosion change by the elasticity coefficient method. Results showed that the soil erosion decreased from 1013 t.km(-2).a(-1) in 1991-1995 to 595 t.km(-2).a(-1) in 2011-2015, with a downward trend in the whole period. Spatially, most areas had soil erosion of slight intensity, and the areas with high-intensity erosion concentrated in a northeast-southwest strip with hilly-gully landscapes or densely distributed rivers. The changes in surface conditions including vegetation cover and soil conservation measures had dominant effects on the spatial heterogeneity of erosion, their contribution to erosion reduction was 119%. But rainfall erosivity increased soil erosion, and it had a contribution to erosion reduction of-28%. These results are helpful in understanding the mechanism behind the changes in soil erosion and providing information for sustainable soil and water management and vegetation restoration.

In order to examine a potential solution to this 'Lose-Lose' situation, a unique project is underway, with the collaboration of the Yeroham Municipality and the adjacent Rahma Bedouin farmers' village. The concept of this ongoing Programme is based on bidirectional knowledge transfer of farming data between the farmers and land scientists, aimed to adapt Bedouin traditional cultivation methods and transform them into methods that restore the environment and are also profitable. In order to reach this goal, a highly knowledgeable Bedouin liaison person was appointed to carry out the project together with the Coordinating Team. A comprehensive study and tour were carried out in order to analyze the different landforms and Bedouin cultivation preferences. An initial survey was carried out and data from literature collected in order to determine the ecological and archaeological characteristics of the ecosystem. The area was then prepared for agricultural utilization by removing widespread garbage and dealing with wadis that have been filled with construction waste. This project, which integrates soil enhancement, agriculture utilization, and traditional Bedouin farming, aims for rehabilitation of the northern Negev gullied areas. However, the implementation of the study concept in the field is accompanied by many challenges related to Bedouin interclan communication and the diverse types of degraded lands.

J	Wang, CG; Cao, WH; Ma, B; Xiao, JB				Wang, Chenguang; Cao, Wenhua; Ma, Bo; Xiao, Junbo			Effects of freezing-thawing on different types of soil organic matter on the Loess Plateau of China	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												To study the influence of freeze-thawing on the organic matter content of Loess Plateau soils, four typical soils of the region, namely, sandy soil, black loessial soil, yellow loamy soil, and cinnamon soil, were selected for this study. The indoor simulation test was used to study the change characteristics of organic matter content under the combined effects of freeze-thaw cycles, soil water content, and depth. When the water content and depth were the same, the organic matter content of the different soil types showed an increasing trend with the increase in freeze-thaw cycles, and the relationship between organic matter content and freeze-thaw cycles could be expressed by a power function. In general, in sandy soil and black loessial soil, the water content at the highest soil organic matter content was 15% and 8%, respectively, under different freeze-thaw cycles. However, in yellow loamy soil and cinnamon soil, on the whole, the water content was 20% when the organic matter content was the highest in the early stage, but when freeze-thaw cycles was 15, the water content changed when the organic matter content was the highest to 16% and 8%, respectively. This study can provide some data support and reference for revealing the mechanism of freeze-thaw effect on soil organic matter content changes.																			1866-6280	1866-6299				OCT	2023	82	20							466	10.1007/s12665-023-11153-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-023-11153-1													WOS:001068208300008

A large quantity of brackish water is stored underground in this region, and whether this water can be used properly in agriculture is becoming a crucial issue that is about to be resolved. The SALTMED model is a generic modeling tool for efficient irrigation management strategies, especially for cyclic use of saline and fresh water as well as different water qualities, and it still needs further investigation for alternate irrigation using saline and fresh water at different growth stages of winter wheat. Therefore, the aim of this investigation was to evaluate the performance of SALTMED model and simulate the production of winter wheat grown under different irrigation strategies. Irrigation strategies comprised rain-fed cultivation (NI), fresh and saline water irrigation (FS), saline and fresh water irrigation (SF), saline water irrigation (SS), and fresh water irrigation (FF). Three-year observed data were used for the validations of SALTMED model. The values of evaluation indices of relative error, RMSE, NRMSE, index of agreement (D-index), and R-2 between simulated and observed grain yield were 6.8%, 0.8, 10.7, 0.9, and 0.9, respectively. The model results supported and matched the observed data and indicated similar differences among the irrigated and rain-fed treatments. It is concluded that the SALTMED model is able to predict grain yield of winter wheat and its productivity under the alternate irrigation using saline and fresh water and their interaction in the climate condition of the NCP.

A ten-year long experiment was used to study effects of: (i) no inputs (Control, O), (ii) 100% inorganic fertilizers (F) compared to reduced fertilizers inputs (55%) supplemented with biomass incorporation from (iii) opportunity legume crop (Vigna radiata) (LE), (iv) green manure (Sesbania aculeata) (GM), (v) farmyard manure (FYM), (vi) wheat stubble (WS), and (vii) rice stubble (RS). Maximum C input to soil (as the percentage of C assimilated in the system) was in GM (36%) followed by RS (34%), WS (33%), LE (24%), and FYM (21%) compared to O (15%) and F (15%). Total C input to soil had a direct effect on soil C stock, soil C fractions (maximum in VLc and LLc), yet the responses in terms of biological yield were controlled by the quality of the biomass (C:N ratio, decomposition, etc.) incorporated. Legume-based biomass inputs accrued most benefits for soil C sequestration and biological productivity.

However, the influence of long-term tillage practices on the rhizosphere bacterial community in lime concretion black soil remains largely unknown. In this study, the effects of nine-year rotary tillage (RT), no-tillage (NT), subsoiling tillage (ST), and plow tillage (PT) on soil chemical properties, microbial community structure, and correlations between bacterial communities and soil properties in the maize rhizosphere were investigated. The results revealed that the maize yield in ST and PT was higher by 10.61% and 10.26% than that in RT and by 10.25% and 9.90% than that in NT, respectively. The soil organic matter (SOM) and total nitrogen (TN) contents in NT and ST were significantly higher than those in RT and PT, whereas the available phosphorus (AP) content in ST and PT was significantly higher than that in NT and RT. The diversity and richness of the soil bacterial communities exhibited a trend of NT > RT > PT > ST. The principal component analysis revealed that the soil bacterial community differed among treatments. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis demonstrated that Proteobacteria, Armatimonadetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Chloroflexi could serve as crucial biomarkers. Phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) results revealed that genes involved in carbon, lipid, and xenobiotic metabolism were enriched under ST and PT, whereas those involved in nitrogen and carbon fixation were enriched under NT. Besides, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Armatimonadetes were positively associated with AP levels and negatively associated with pH; however, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes exhibited an opposite trend. Overall, ST and PT improved the soil properties and environmental suitability by increasing the bacterial keystone taxa; thus, these practices improved crop yield. These findings could enhance our understanding of the rhizosphere functional microbial community in lime concretion black soil for winter wheat-summer maize double-cropping system.					yang, xiao/JLL-7721-2023; Yang, Ying/JLL-3724-2023; Chen, Xin/JDN-2017-2023; Zhou, Yue/JHS-8791-2023; Zhang, Lijun/JEZ-7925-2023; zhao, yan/JNT-6961-2023; yuanyuan, Li/JEZ-6497-2023; zhang, xiao/JCN-8822-2023; xuan, li/JNI-7432-2023; yang, rui/JHI-3328-2023; Wang, Jing/JRW-1512-2023; LI, WEI/JUE-9796-2023; li, xiang/JCN-9316-2023; zhang, ying/JQX-1479-2023; Li, Wen/JQI-4757-2023; Yang, Jie/JDM-6213-2023; zhao, lin/JJF-0406-2023; YI, J/JJE-7713-2023; li, yifan/JHU-9272-2023; Li, Yan/JRW-0176-2023; Wang, Xuechun/JRX-6509-2023; Zhang, Yunyi/JHS-3626-2023; Wang, yl/JNR-4963-2023; wang, xiaoxuan/JMP-6531-2023; wang, wenjuan/JGD-0428-2023; zheng, yan/JKJ-3632-2023	Yang, Jie/0000-0002-3941-0053; Zhang, Peiyu/0009-0002-2323-059X														2073-4395				MAR	2023	13	3							790	10.3390/agronomy13030790	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13030790													WOS:000953603700001
J	Krasnov, BR; Shenbrot, GI				Krasnov, Boris R.; Shenbrot, Georgy I.			Evoregions of fleas and their small mammalian hosts: Do they coincide?	PARASITOLOGY												Combining the biogeography and phylogenetic patterns of parasite-host associations allows a better understanding of the history of parasite-host interactions, which can be achieved via biogeographic regionalization incorporating phylogenetic information. Recently, the concepts of evoregions (regions where a majority of species evolved from one or several ancestors inhabiting these regions) and evolutionary transition zones (regions of high phylogenetic turnover) have been proposed, coupled with a classification approach for these concepts. We applied this approach to 206 flea species and 265 host species of the Palearctic and aimed to identify evoregions and evolutionary transition zones for both fleas and hosts and to understand whether these evoregions and transition zones match each other. We identified 5 evoregions with 3 transition zones for either fleas or hosts, but neither the positions and boundaries of the flea and host evoregions nor the transition zones coincided. Indications of multiple geographic centres of diversification of the same flea lineages suggested that (a) the common evolutionary history of fleas and hosts was characterized by multiple events other than codiversification and that (b) dispersal played an important role in flea and host assemblies. Barriers to dispersal could be represented by landscape features (deserts and mountain ranges) and/or climate differences.																			0031-1820	1469-8161				2023 SEP 14	2023										10.1017/S0031182023000884	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182023000884		SEP 2023						36799019					WOS:001075271000001

However, the natural resource potential in Ethiopian highlands has been eroding due to high population pressure and climate change. This study examined the link between communal resource use and willingness to supply extra unpaid labor days to conserve communal land in Kilte-Awlaelo woreda of Tigrai region of Ethiopia. The study found that the relatively rich households extracted communal resources like animal fodder, firewood and construction materials relative to the poor households in the study area. On the contrary, the poor households tend to supply extra unpaid labor days to conserve communal land compared to wealthy households. Thus, the poor households have to be compensated for the extra unpaid labor days they are willing to supply to take care of the communal resources and, at the same time, the relatively wealthy households have to contribute money, as they could not contribute free labor days, to ensure sustainable communal resource conservation.

Influences of revegetation mode on soil water dynamic in gully slope of the Chinese Loess hilly-gully region	NATURAL HAZARDS												Gully slope is one of the most active areas of soil erosion in small watershed of the Chinese Loess hilly-gully region. Although its soil erosion has been effectively controlled with the implementation of the "Grain-for-Green Program" in this region, the soil water storage and distribution have been also impacted. In particular, unreasonable revegetation model has aggravated the water shortage, which may in turn threaten the health of ecosystems. However, yet little is known about the effect mechanism of vegetation on soil water in the gully slope. In this study, we examined the relationship between two revegetation modes, including afforestation (i.e. black locust forest) and natural revegetation (i.e. the grassland), and soil water in a depth of 0-120 cm of the gully slope, during the rainy season. The results showed that the effect of the vegetation to the soil water was smaller than that of the precipitation. Furthermore, the response of soil water to the environmental factors was higher in afforestation vegetation due to its lower soil water content, resulting in higher space dependence for soil water, compared to the natural revegetation. The lower soil water content of the black locust forest was mainly caused by its higher recession rate, not its supply. The soil water was deficient for a long time, caused by afforestation, with a shallower formation depth of the dried soil layer and stronger desiccation degree. However, this deficient could not be effectively relieved until in wet year. In comparison with the ridge slope, the effect of vegetation to soil water in gully slope was stronger, with greater water consumption in afforestation vegetation and the higher water storage in natural revegetation. From the aspect of water resources conservation on the water scale, the natural revegetation was the optimal revegetation mode in the gully slope of the loess hilly region.																			0921-030X	1573-0840				OCT	2020	104	1					51	72		10.1007/s11069-020-04157-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-020-04157-8		JUL 2020											WOS:000548783000001

This study aims to employ multiple tracers and methods to investigate the mechanism of groundwater recharge in the thick loess deposits of China. We collected soil samples under different vegetation, unconfined groundwater, and precipitation to determine the water isotopes (delta H-2, delta O-18, and H-3), chloride (Cl-), nitrate (NO3-). Then, these tracers were employed to estimate recharge rates with methods considering the differences in shallow- and deep-rooted vegetation, as well as those in unsaturated and saturated zones. Results indicated that local precipitation predominantly recharges groundwater through matrix flow at a velocity of 14.5 cm year(-1) with the residence time of > 200 years. The recharge rates range from 0 to 37 mm year(-1) equivalent to 0-7% of annual average precipitation. However, the deep-rooted vegetation greatly reduced deep drainage compared with shallow-rooted vegetation, which will perturb the current hydraulic connectivity between unsaturated and saturated zones. The multiple tracers and methods can complement each other to enhance the understanding of groundwater recharge mechanisms. The indicated relationship between recharge form and land use suggests the urgency in developing strategies to balance the agroforestry system and water resource sustainability.

A Two-Stage Multisite and Multivariate Weather Generator	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS												The spatial structure of climatic variables synthesized by a weather generator has considerable impact on the modeling of hydrological variability; however, in most cases, it needs computationally intensive work to reproduce multisite and/or multivariate correlations. This work proposed a two-stage weather generator (TSWG) to preserve intersite and intervariable correlations of daily precipitation, maximum and minimum temperatures. The first stage generates daily precipitation and temperature for each site and for each variable with, but not limited to, the Richardson-type approach. The second stage rebuilds the multisite multivariate correlation using a distribution-free shuffle procedure. The TSWG was applied to a network of 15 stations in the Jing River catchment (Northwest China). It reproduced the statistical parameters and multisite and multivariate correlations well. Furthermore, indirect validation by hydrological modeling showed TSWG outputs could be used satisfactorily for simulating streamflow variability. As a distribution-free method, the correlation reconstruction method can be applied to variables with different probability distributions. The TSWG can efficiently reconstruct the correlation with one optimization for all stations and all variables, which is superior to most current methods operated once for one station pair and one variable. The TSWG provides an option for improved multisite and multivariate weather generation.

The purpose of this study is to map QTLs and predict candidate genes for kernel size in maize. A total of 199 F-2 and its F-2(:)3 lines from the cross between SG5/SG7 were developed. A composite interval mapping (CIM) method was used to detect QTLs in three environments of F-2 and F-2(:)3 populations. The result showed that a total of 10 QTLs for kernel size were detected, among which were five QTLs for kernel length (KL) and five QTLs for kernel width (KW). Two stable QTLs, qKW-1, and qKL-2, were mapped in all three environments. Three QTLs, qKL-1, qKW-1, and qKW-2, were overlapped with the QTLs identified from previous studies. In order to validate and fine map qKL-2, near-isogenic lines (NILs) were developed by continuous backcrossing between SG5 as the donor parent and SG7 as the recurrent parent. Marker-assisted selection was conducted from BC2F1 generation with molecular markers near qKL-2. A secondary linkage map with six markers around the qKL-2 region was developed and used for fine mapping of qKL-2. Finally, qKL-2 was confirmed in a 1.95 Mb physical interval with selected overlapping recombinant chromosomes on maize chromosome 9 by blasting with the Zea_Mays_B73 v4 genome. Transcriptome analysis showed that a total of 11 out of 40 protein-coding genes differently expressed between the two parents were detected in the identified qKL-2 interval. GRMZM2G006080 encoding a receptor-like protein kinase FERONIA, was predicted as a candidate gene to control kernel size. The work will not only help to understand the genetic mechanisms of kernel size of maize but also lay a foundation for further fine mapping and even cloning of the promising loci.																				1664-8021				NOV 27	2020	11								603920	10.3389/fgene.2020.603920	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2020.603920								33329749					WOS:000597277200001

Here, abundant and rare soil bacterial and fungal communities were characterized along a 15-45-year chronosequence of forest vegetation restoration in the Loess Plateau region. Phylogenetic-bin-based null model analysis (iCAMP), niche breadth index, and co-occurrence network analysis were used to assess microbial community assembly and environmental adaptation of a Robinia pseudoacacia plantation under longterm vegetation restoration. The drift process governed community assembly of abundant and rare soil fungi and bacteria. With increasing soil total phosphorus content, the relative importance of drift increased, while dispersal limitation and heterogeneous selection exhibited opposite trends for abundant and rare fungi. Rare soil fungal composition dissimilarities were dominated by species replacement processes. Abundant microbial taxa had higher ecological niche width and contribution to ecosystem multifunctionality than rare taxa. Node property values (e.g., degree and betweenness) of abundant microbial taxa were substantially higher than those of rare microbial taxa, indicating abundant species occupied a central position in the network. This study provides insights into the diversity and stability of microbial communities during vegetation restoration in Loess Plateau. The findings highlight that abundant soil fungi and bacteria have broad environmental adaptation and major implications for soil multifunctionality under long-term vegetation restoration.						zhouping, shangguan/0000-0002-5815-6310													0013-9351	1096-0953				FEB 1	2024	242								117720	10.1016/j.envres.2023.117720	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2023.117720		NOV 2023						37996008					WOS:001129126900001
J	Arun, PV; Karnieli, A				Arun, Pattathal V.; Karnieli, Arnon			Learning of physically significant features from earth observation data: an illustration for crop classification and irrigation scheme detection	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS												Earth observation data processing requires interpretable deep learning (DL) models that learn physically significant and meaningful features. The current study proposes approaches to make the network to learn meaningful features. In addition, a set of interpretability- and explanation-based evaluation strategies are proposed to evaluate the DL models. Adversarial variational encoding along with constraints to regulate latent representations and embed label information are employed to learn interpretable manifold. The proposed architecture, called interpretable adversarial encoding network (IAENet), significantly improves the results compared to other main existing DL models. The proposed IAENet learns the features which are essential in distinguishing the different classes thereby improving the interpretability of the model. The explanations for the different models are generated through analysis of the concepts learned by each model using activation maximization. Besides, the relevance assigned by the model to input features is also estimated using the layer-wise relevance propagation approach. Experiments on the phenological curve-based crop classification illustrate that IAENet learn relevant features (giving importance to the non-rainy season) to distinguish different irrigation schemes. The performance can be attributed to the learned interpretable manifold, and the refinement of architectural units and convolutions considering the point-nature and irregular sampling of the input data. Experiments on learning crop-specific features from multispectral images for crop-type classification indicate that IAENet learns red and green edge features crucial in distinguishing the studied crops. The improvement in interpretability of the DL models is found to reduce the sensitivity toward network parameters. The proposed evaluation measures facilitate ascertaining the physical significance of the learned manifold.

In the study, the SOC fractions were measured including soil easily oxidizable carbon (SEOC), soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC), soil water soluble carbon (SWSC), and soil mineralizable carbon (SMC) at the Loess Plateau of China by using four biocrusts. The results show that SOC fractions in the biocrust layer were consistently higher than that in the subsoil layers. The average SOC content of moss crust was approximately 1.3-2.0 fold that of three other biocrusts. Moss crusts contain the lowest ratio of SEOC to SOC compared with other biocrusts. The ratio of SMC to SOC was the highest in light cyanobacteria biocrust and the lowest in moss crust, but no difference was observed in SMBC to SOC and SWSC to SOC in biocrust layers among four studied biocrusts. The results show that the moss crusts increase the accumulation of organic carbon into soil and reduce the ratio of SEOC to SOC and SMC to SOC. Together, these findings indicate that moss crusts increase the SOC stability and have important implications that SOC fractions and mineralization amount are good indicators for assessing the SOC stability.					shanshan, Wang/D-4444-2012; YANG, Xue/HPI-0953-2023; Xu, Ming/IWM-0504-2023	shanshan, Wang/0000-0002-6922-1640; 													1214-1178	1805-9368					2019	65	2					104	109		10.17221/473/2018-PSE	http://dx.doi.org/10.17221/473/2018-PSE													WOS:000457453600008

Here, we characterized soil bacterial and fungal communities in rhizosphere and bulk soil along a 15-45-year chronosequence of forest vegetation restoration. The neutral model, modified stochasticity ratio, niche breadth index, co-occurrence network, and source tracker were used to assess microbial community assembly, species enrichment, and filtering processes in the rhizosphere and bulk soil of Robinia pseudoacacia plantations. The relative importance of deterministic processes in microbial community assembly differed markedly between the rhizosphere and bulk soil. Microbial network complexity was higher in the rhizosphere soil than in the bulk soil. Both rhizosphere and bulk soil microbial networks were dynamically associated with forest age. Overall, the rhizosphere microbial community was mainly derived from the bulk soil, and filtered by the soil environment and plant selection. The soil environment was less selective for bacteria than for fungi, thus increasing bacterial community migration ratio. Furthermore, soil microbes formed distinct clusters in different niche compartments, with greater interaction and niche sharing potential in the rhizosphere soil than in the bulk soil.

Because of climate change and the revegetation project, the streamflow has been reported to significantly decrease in past decades in China's Loess Plateau (CLP); however, the changes in streamflow components have not been fully investigated. The objective of this study is thus to detect and attribute the changes in baseflow in the CLP using data of 55 hydrological stations for 1956-1990 and 2001-2019. The geographic detector, correlation analysis and elasticity coefficient methods were employed to qualitatively and quantitively analyze the influence of various factors on baseflow. The baseflow accounts for 35%-76% of streamflow. The baseflow in 85% of hydrological stations decreased by >10%, while the baseflow index (BFI) of 82% hydrological stations showed an upward trend. Precipitation and hydrogeological condition (e.g., loess thickness) were likely to dominate the spatial heterogeneity of baseflow, while the potential evapotranspiration, population, sub-surface runoff, NDVI and soil water were responsible for the decrease in baseflow with contributions of 27%, 21%, 17%, 16% and 16%, respectively. The consistence or inconsistence between baseflow and BFI as well as their relations to environmental changes provide new insights into the changes in hydrological processes.

Fruit sets are usually thinned early in their development to produce large, high-quality dates. However, no effort has yet been made to comprehensively examine fruit load effects on date palm water use, CO2 fluxes and growth. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of fruit load on these factors. Twelve date palms, six with fruit removed ("without fruit") and six untreated ("with fruit"), were irrigated with equal amounts of water at sufficient levels for maintaining optimal soil water conditions. Sap flow and frond elongation were continuously measured. Gas exchange parameters (i.e., stomatal conductance and CO2 assimilation rate) and fruit growth (i.e., fruit size, mass, and sugar content) were monitored periodically. No significant differences were found in gas exchange, water consumption and frond elongation between the two treatments several weeks after the onset of the fruit load differentiation. However, a pronounced increase in stomatal conductance and CO2 assimilation rates in palms with fruit compared to those without fruit was identified during the sugar accumulation and post-harvest periods. Continuously increasing water consumption in palms with fruit was also observed during these periods, probably as a result of the progressive recovery of depleted carbohydrate and water storage in the tree. In addition, the frond elongation rate of palms with fruit was remarkably lower than those without fruit until the end of the harvest. It is concluded that crop load has a pronounced effect on physiological behaviors and water use of the cultivated date palm. Therefore, irrigation management must consider fruit load to achieve optimal yield.

J	Li, BB; Yang, Y; Li, Z				Li, Bingbing; Yang, Yi; Li, Zhi			Combined effects of multiple factors on spatiotemporally varied soil moisture in China's Loess Plateau	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Identifying the factors controlling spatiotemporally varied soil moisture (SM) is fundamental for water resources management, but the combined effects of multiple factors across multiple timescales have been rarely considered. The objective of this study is to identify the factor(s) individually or simultaneously controlling SM in China's Loess Plateau, a region with arid climate experiencing substantial vegetation change because of a revegetation project implemented in 1999. With SM product derived from Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model Version 3.0a, we investigated large-scale SM dynamics for surface soil (0-10 cm) and root zone (10-250 cm) for 1982-2015, and considered environmental factors at the regional scale (e.g. precipitation PCP, mean temperature TMP, potential evapotranspiration PET, normalized difference vegetation index NDVI, land use types, elevation, slope gradient, clay fraction, and reference bulk density) and at the global scale (e.g. El Nino/Southern Oscillation ENSO, Pacific Decadal Oscillation PDO, North Atlantic Oscillation NAO, and Arctic Oscillation AO). Spatially, the mean SM in both surface and deep layers decreases with a gradient from the southeast to the northwest. Temporally, SM tends to decrease in the southeast while increases in the northwest, implying a pattern of "wet gets drier, dry gets wetter". Individually, PET and ENSO are the most important regional and global factors controlling SM, respectively. Simultaneously, PET, PCP, and NDVI have combined effects, while the global factors exhibit no combined effects. The regional and global factors both influence SM at a scale of 8-16 months across the whole study period. In addition, the effects of regional factors exhibit at the scale of 32-64 months but tend to disappear after 1999. The global factors have smaller impacts than regional factors, but they tend to indirectly influence SM through perturbing regional climate. The identified factors highlight the complicated changes and controlling factors of SM, which provides important information for land use management and water resources management. The employed methods are effective in identifying the combined effects of multiple factors and can be extrapolated to other regions.					李, 冰冰/GRR-5488-2022														0378-3774	1873-2283				DEC 1	2021	258								107180	10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107180	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107180		SEP 2021											WOS:000700576700002

Here, we disentangled three main mechanisms that are commonly proposed to explain such persistence, namely, obligatory relationships, in which the host is fully dependent on its endosymbiont, fitness advantages conferred by the endosymbiont, and reproductive manipulations imposed by the endosymbiont. Our model system reflects an extreme case, in which the Wolbachia endosymbiont persists in all female flea hosts but rarely in male ones. We cured fleas of both sexes of Wolbachia but found no indications for either lower reproduction, offspring survival, or a change in the offspring sex ratio, compared to Wolbacia-infected fleas. These results do not support any of the suggested mechanisms. We highlight future directions to advance our understanding of endosymbiont persistence in fleas, as well as in other model systems, with extreme sex-differences in endosymbiont persistence. Insights from such studies are predicted to shed light on the evolution and ecology of arthropod-endosymbiont interactions in nature.

The framework termed "SR with a privileged frame" incorporates the privileged frame into SR while retaining the fundamental spacetime symmetry which, in the standard SR, manifests itself as Lorentz invariance. The correspondingly modified GR, like the standard GR, is based on the equivalence principle but with the properly modified spacetime local symmetry in which an invariant combination differs from the Minkowski interval of the standard SR. Applying the modified GR to cosmology yields the luminosity distance - redshift relation corrected such that the observed deceleration parameter can be negative as it is obtained from the data for Type Ia supernovae. Thus, the observed negative values of the deceleration parameter can be explained within the matter-dominated Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmological model of the universe without introducing the dark energy. A number of other observations, such as Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Cosmic Microwave Background, also can be well fit to the cosmological model arising from the GR.based on the SR with a privileged frame.

Black locust, Robinia pseudoacacia L. is a common, widely planted species to control soil erosion on the Loess Plateau. Previous studies have focused on economic values but the interactions between soil and plant carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) remain unknown. Investigating variations of soil, green and senesced leaf C, N and P levels in R. pseudoacacia along a latitudinal gradient is useful to understanding its ecological functions. The results show that soil C, N and senesced leaf N and P significantly decreased with an increase in latitude, but there were no significant changes in the senesced leaf C and soil P. The resorption efficiency of N was related with latitude and soil N levels, and the relation between green leaf N and soil N was significant. These relations suggest that soil N was the key in affecting green leaf N levels. At higher latitudes, senesced leaves had lower N levels associated with higher N resorption efficiency to maintain a stable N content in green leaves. With a decrease of soil N, R. pseudoacacia can enhance N resorption efficiency to meet the demand of growth. Thus, it is an important species for reforestation, especially in nutrient-poor environments.

JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES												Precipitation in the arid region of Northwest China (NWC) shows high spatial and temporal variability, in large part because of the region's complex topography and moisture conditions. However, rain gauges in the area are sparse, and most are located at altitudes below 2000 m, which limits our understanding of precipitation at higher altitudes. Interpolated precipitation products and satellite-based datasets with high spatiotemporal resolution can potentially be a substitute for rain gauge data. In this study, the spatial and temporal properties of precipitation in the arid region of NWC were analyzed using two gridded precipitation products: SURF_CLI_CHN_PRE_DAY_GRID_0.5 (CHN) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43. The CHN and TRMM 3B43 data showed that in summer, precipitation was more concentrated in southern Xinjiang than in northern Xinjiang, and the opposite was true in winter. The largest difference in precipitation between mountainous areas and plains appeared in summer. High-elevation areas with high precipitation showed more stable annual precipitation. Different sub-regions showed distinctive precipitation distributions with elevation, and both datasets showed that the maximum precipitation zone appeared at high altitude.

J	Suo, LZ; Huang, MB				Suo, Lizhu; Huang, Mingbin			Stochastic modelling of soil water dynamics and sustainability for three vegetation types on the Chinese Loess Plateau	SOIL RESEARCH												Soil water dynamics play an active role in ecological and hydrologic processes. Soil water exhibits a stochastic nature because of the large temporal variations in precipitation and evapotranspiration. Objectives of this study were to analyse the probabilistic nature of soil water under three vegetation types, to simulate their probability density functions (PDFs) using a stochastic model, and to determine the most sustainable vegetation types. Soil water data were collected over a 3-year period with a bi-weekly frequency at plots in the Loess Plateau, China, under grass (Bothriochloa ischaemum L., BOI), shrub, sea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L., SEB) and tree, Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr, CHP). The data were compared with values simulated using the Laio stochastic model. The results showed that the mean relative soil water contents differed in the order: BOI > CHP > SEB. Soil water was related to the daily rainfall and evapotranspiration. Under the same climate, topography and soil conditions, the soil water PDF was sensitive to a critical water content at which plants begin closing stomata and the mean maximum daily evapotranspiration rate. Based on the shape of the PDFs and their statistical moments, the Laio stochastic model accurately simulated the soil water PDFs under all three vegetation types in the semi-humid area of the Loess Plateau. The soil water PDFs for three vegetation types were simulated with four leaf area index scenarios; BOI and CHP were the most sustainable vegetation types compared with SEB in terms of maintaining soil water availability and soil erosion control.						huang, ming bin/0000-0001-9792-3124													1838-675X	1838-6768					2019	57	5					500	512		10.1071/SR18118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR18118													WOS:000475314600007

However, the magnitude of soil erosion on abandoned sloping farmland still remained unclear and their responses to vegetation succession were rarely addressed. The main objective of this study is to determine the magnitude of soil erosion along vegetation succession and explore the impact of vegetation succession on soil erosion from abandoned sloping farmland. Field observations were employed to monitor the rainfall, runoff, and soil erosion of seven sloping farmland plots with different abandoned ages and bare land from 2015 to 2019. The results indicated that the annual runoff depth and soil erosion modulus of vegetation types were in the range of 0.46 to 5.49 mm center dot a(-1) and 1.3 to 24.5 t center dot km(-2)center dot a(-1), respectively. The vegetation effectively reduced the annual surface runoff and soil erosion with reduction of 73.8% to 97.8% and 98.0% to 99.9% as opposed to bare land. However, there were no significant differences in runoff and soil erosion for different vegetation types along succession. The largest event of vegetation types contributed to 38.7%-44.1% of the annual runoff and 42.5%-66.3% of the annual soil erosion, respectively. Vegetation restoration considerably alleviated the contribution of largest erosive event to annual soil erosion. The relationships between soil erosion, runoff and rainfall factors could be fitted well by linear functions, and the performances of regression models in predicting runoff were more satisfactory compared to in predicting soil erosion. The Artemisia gmelinii (Agm) + Stipa bungeana (Sb) optimized the trade-off between sediment reduction and runoff maintenance, which should be selected as a suitable vegetation type to achieve the sustainability of socio-ecological systems.

Regional flea and host assemblages form biogeographic, but not ecological, clusters: evidence for a dispersal-based mechanism as a driver of species composition	PARASITOLOGY												We used data on the species composition of regional assemblages of fleas and their small mammalian hosts from 6 biogeographic realms and applied a novel method of step-down factor analyses (SDFA) and cluster analyses to identify biogeographic (across the entire globe) and ecological (within a realm across the main terrestrial biomes) clusters of these assemblages. We found that, at the global scale, the clusters of regional assemblage loadings on SDFA axes reflected well the assemblage distribution, according to the biogeographic realms to which they belong. At the global scale, the cluster topology, corresponding to the biogeographic realms, was similar between flea and host assemblages, but the topology of subtrees within realm-specific clusters substantially differed between fleas and hosts. At the scale of biogeographic realms, the distribution of regional flea and host assemblages did not correspond to the predominant biome types. Assemblages with similar loadings on SDFA axes were often situated in different biomes and vice versa. The across-biome, within-realm distributions of flea vs host assemblages suggested weak congruence between these distributions. Our results indicate that dispersal is a predominant mechanism of flea and host community assembly across large regions.

The characterization of spike glycoproteins, polyproteins and other viral proteins from viruses is important for antiviral drug development. Homology modelling of these proteins with known templates offers the opportunity to discover ligand-binding sites and explore the possible antiviral properties of these protein-ligand complexes. In this study, we performed a complete bioinformatic analysis, sequence alignment, comparison of multiple sequences and modelling of the SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences, the spike protein and the polyproteins for homology with known proteins. We also analysed binding sites in these models for possible binding with ligands that exhibit antiviral properties. Our results indicated that the sequence of the polyprotein isolate SARS-CoV-2_HKU-SZ-001_2020 showed 98.94 percent identity to SARS-coronavirus NSP12 bound to NSP7 and NSP8 co-factors. The results also indicated that a part of the viral genome (residues 3268-3573 in Frame 2 with 306 amino acids) of the SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank Accession Number MN908947.3) when modelled with template 2a5i of the PDB database showed 96 percent identity to a 3C-like peptidase of SARS-CoVs, which has the ability to bind with an aza-peptide epoxide (APE) known for the irreversible inhibition of SARS-CoV main peptidase. A docking profile with 9 different conformations of the ligand with the protein model using Autodock Vina showed an affinity of -7.1 kcal mol(-1). This region was conserved in 831 genomes of SARS-CoV-2. The part of the genome (residues 1568-1882 in Frame 2 with 315 amino acids) when modelled with template ; 3e9s of the PDB database showed 82 percent identity to a papain-like protease/deubiquitinase, which when complexed with ligand GRL0617 acts as an inhibitor and can block SARS-CoV replication. A docking profile with 9 different conformations of the ligand with the protein model using Autodock Vina showed an affinity of -7.9 kcal mol(-1). This region was conserved in 831 genomes of SARS-CoV-2. It is possible that these ligands can be used as antivirals of SARS-CoV-2.

J	Zhu, LX; Shen, YF; Li, SQ				Zhu, Lixia; Shen, Yufang; Li, Shiqing			Microbial residues were increased by film mulching with manure amendment in a semiarid agroecosystem	ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE												Amino sugars, as a kind of microbial residue, are strongly associated with cycling of microbial-derived soil organic matter. However, responses of amino sugars to agricultural practices on the Loess Plateau in North-western China are poorly known. The objective was to evaluate effects of film mulching (no film mulching + NPK fertilizers, CK; film mulching + NPK fertilizers, PF; film mulching + NPK fertilizers + cow manure, FM) on accumulations of amino sugars in this region. FM significantly increased total amino sugar by 190.46 mg kg(-1) in 0-10 cm layer and 214.66 mg kg(-1) in 10-20 cm layer relative to CK, but PF significantly decreased it by 139.28 mg kg(-1) in 0-10 cm layer. Ratios of glucosamine to muramic acid were markedly decreased by 2.50 in 0-10 cm layer and 2.28 in 10-20 cm layer in FM than CK, suggesting a tendency of microbial residues pool shift towards bacterial residues in this agroecosystem. These results indicated film mulching alone was not benefitial to accumulation of amino sugar while organic manure contributed to the build-up of amino sugar partly due to manure contained microbial residues. The different patterns of amino sugars suggested significant changes in the quality of microbial-derived organic matter.

J	Arun, PV; Karnieli, A				Arun, P., V; Karnieli, Arnon			Augmentation of Vegetation Index Curves Considering the Crop-Specific Phenologica Characteristics	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												The state-of-the-art crop phenological classifiers use vegetation index (VI) time-series data and deep learning (DL) techniques. However, the scarcity of training samples limits the performance of these approaches. Unlike the conventional augmentation techniques, the data augmentation of VI curves should preserve the crop-specific phenological events. The DL-based augmentation approaches do not give good results when the training samples are limited. Also, the conventional approaches such as translation, rotation, scaling, and wrapping do not preserve the characteristic features of the index curves, thereby making them inappropriate for the VI-curve-based augmentations. This article proposes a non-DL-based data augmentation strategy that requires only a minimal number of actual training samples. In the proposed approach, the periodic phenological events and the underlying trend for each crop class are modeled to improve the augmentation. The trends of different crop classes are estimated by jointly maximizing the autocorrelation and variance, while the optimal subsequences are generalized as the phenological events. The proposed augmentation strategy of using Maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform for obtaining the surrogates that retain the crop-specific features and periodicities significantly improves the results. It may be noted that the proposed approach does not alter the wavelet coefficients that are characteristics of a given crop class. The experiments using time series VI data, covering 90 fields of wheat, and 60 fields of barley, confirm better accuracy of the proposed augmentation approaches as compared to the prominent approaches.

Despite its relevance, an accurate high resolution record of historical land cover maps is currently lacking over the Sudano-Sahel. In this study, 30 m resolution historically consistent land cover and cover fraction maps are provided over the Sudano-Sahel for the period 1986-2015. These land cover/cover fraction maps are achieved based on the Landsat archive preprocessed on Google Earth Engine and a random forest classification/regression model, while historical consistency is achieved using the hidden Markov model. Using these historical maps, a multitude of variability in the dynamic Sudano-Sahel region over the past 30 years is revealed. On the one hand, Sahel-wide cropland expansion and the re-greening of the Sahel is observed in the discrete land cover classification. On the other hand, subtle changes such as forest degradation are detected based on the cover fraction maps. Additionally, exploiting the 30 m spatial resolution, fine-scale changes, such as smallholder or subsistence farming, can be detected. The historical land cover/cover fraction maps presented in this study are made available via an open-access platform.

An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of micronutrient application to different varieties of durum wheat and seeding rate on final harvest grain quality under different growing locations. The treatments were arranged in split-split plot design where the varieties were assigned in the main plot, micronutrients into the subplots, and seeding rate into the sub-subplots. Each variety was sown at four levels of seeding rates and treated with ZnSO4 and FeSO4 applied foliarly, both at a rate of 25 Kg ha(-1) during flowering. Micronutrients were applied in the form of ZnSO4 7H(2)O and FeSO4 7H(2)O. The study confirmed that application of 25 Kg ha(-1) ZnSO4-containing fertilizer has increased mineral content from 33.04 mg Kg(-1) to 56.73 mg kg(-1). The tested durum wheat varieties significantly differ in their capacity to accumulate grain Zn and Fe concentrations. Higher amount of Zn (20 mg kg(-1)) and Fe (10 mg kg(-1)) were accumulated by the landrace 208304 than by Asassa, an improved commercial variety. Increasing seeding rate from 100-175 Kg ha(-1) has reduced grain Zn and Fe concentrations. Grain mineral concentration was significantly lower at the Mekelle location than at the Melfa location. It can be concluded that foliar application of ZnSO4 and FeSO4 to the landrace, acc.208304, combined with 125 Kg seeds ha(-1) can produce better Zn and Fe denser durum wheat grain. This will help to combat the hidden hunger, especially in resource poor countries, where fortified foods are limited in access and unaffordable by small-scale farmers.

In order to contribute better towards agricultural development, the extension and advisory agents need new capacities to confront the present challenges in agriculture. The present study was conducted in four Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) zones of Krishi Vigyan Kendra's (KVK) selected by simple random sampling without replacement to map the present level of competencies of the extensionists. Twenty KVK from each zone were selected randomly and three extensionists from each KVK were selected by using simple random sampling technique. The total sample size was 240. Mapping of the competency was dealt in two parts viz Emotional Intelligence (EI) and Professional Competency (PC). Correspondence Analysis (CA) technique was used to map the professional competencies of the extensionists. The first part of mapping dealing with EI showed that the respondents had average level of EI. The analysis of the competencies showed that most of the competency statements for the extension professionals were clustered around the center of the biplot showing medium level of PC. Hence, this provides an opportunity to the policy makers to devise suitable strategies to develop these competencies of the extensionists so that they become efficient and effective in their job.

J	Xu, B; Cui, QL; Zheng, DC				Xu, Bing; Cui, Qingliang; Zheng, Decong			IMPROVEMENT DESIGN AND SIMULATION ANALYSIS ON CENTRIFUGAL DISC ORGANIC FERTILIZER SPREADER	INMATEH-AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING												Aiming at the poor efficiency in crushing a handful of caking organic fertilizers spraying from the traditional disc spreader, an improved disc spreader equipped with spike-tooth crushing unit was designed with the introduction of its structural composition and working principle. Also simulation experiments were carried out based on the discrete element method according to the solutions made before and after the structural improvement. Firstly, a granular organic fertilizer model was established based on the EDEM and a caking organic fertilizer bonding model was built based on the HMB (Hertz-Mindlin with bonding) contact model. Then two organic fertilizer spreading models corresponding to the solutions were respectively established, based on which simulation experiments were repeated three times on the spreading process. The analysis on the particle velocity vector diagram revealed the interaction relationship between organic fertilizers with the toothed shaft, external wall and disk, verifying the crushing mechanism of crushing unit. By calculating the total number of the bonds generated and broken in the spreading process in both of the spreading models, the average broken rate of bonds in the spreading process was separately 58.87% and 98.05% based on each solution, revealing that the improved solution outperformed the traditional solution in terms of the efficiency in crushing the caking organic fertilizers. This research will be a reference in designing the critical components or improving the overall performance of disc spreader.																			2068-4215	2068-2239				MAY-AUG	2023	70	2					328	336		10.35633/inmateh-70-32	http://dx.doi.org/10.35633/inmateh-70-32													WOS:001053155800012

The purpose of this study was to validate a major quantitative trait locus (QTL), qKW-1, which was identified in the F-2 and F-2:3 populations from a cross between the maize inbred lines SG5/SG7 and to predict candidate genes for kernel width (KW) in maize. A major QTL, qKW-1, was mapped in multiple environments in our previous study. To validate and fine map qKW-1, near-isogenic lines (NILs) with 469 individuals were developed by continuous backcrossing between SG5 as the donor parent and SG7 as the recurrent parent. Marker-assisted selection was conducted from the BC2F1 generation with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers near qKW-1. A secondary linkage map with four markers, PLK12, PLK13, PLK15, and PLK17, was developed and used for mapping the qKW-1 locus. Finally, qKW-1 was mapped between the PLK12 and PLK13 intervals, with a distance of 2.23 cM to PLK12 and 0.04 cM to PLK13, a confidence interval of 5.3 cM and a phenotypic contribution rate of 23.8%. The QTL mapping result obtained was further validated by using selected overlapping recombinant chromosomes on the target segment of maize chromosome 3. Transcriptome analysis showed that a total of 12 out of 45 protein-coding genes differentially expressed between the two parents were detected in the identified qKW-1 physical interval by blasting with the Zea_Mays_B73 v4 genome. GRMZM2G083176 encodes the Niemann-Pick disease type C, and GRMZM2G081719 encodes the nitrate transporter 1 (NRT1) protein. The two genes GRMZM2G083176 and GRMZM2G081719 were predicted to be candidate genes of qKW-1. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) validation was conducted, and the results provide further proof of the two candidate genes most likely responsible for qKW-1. The work will not only help to understand the genetic mechanisms of KW in maize but also lay a foundation for further cloning of promising loci.																			1664-462X					JUN 30	2022	13								935654	10.3389/fpls.2022.935654	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.935654								35845666					WOS:000827354700001

Relevant mechanical parameters of whole fruit compression are calculated by comparing physical tests and virtual simulations. The orthogonal rotating combined experimental design was used to arrange the simulation tests, with the elastic modulus (E), yield limit (Ey), and tangent modulus (Et) as the influence factors and compression force as the result. Response surface optimization was employed to find the closest test point to the force-deformation curve of the physical test. The parameters of the pulp test point are as follows: E = 0.923 MPa, Ey = 0.0897 MPa, and Et = 0.478 MPa. Results show that the step on the force-deformation curve was not the beginning of the pulp yield, which was substantially earlier than the strain rate at the simulation step. The region of increased stress in the pulp first appeared at the junction with the core due to stress concentration. Combining virtual and physical tests to solve the mechanical parameters of fruits is more suitable than testing the standard pulp sample.																			2068-4215	2068-2239				JAN-APR	2023	69	1					527	536		10.35633/inmateh-69-50	http://dx.doi.org/10.35633/inmateh-69-50													WOS:000996501400039

Field experiments were conducted to investigate the soil salt accumulation, responses, and yield simulation of winter wheat to the alternate irrigation strategies during 2017-2019. Five irrigation strategies included rain-fed cultivation (NI), fresh and saline water irrigation (FS), fresh water irrigation (FF), saline water irrigation (SS), and saline and fresh water irrigation (SF) during the growth stages. Irrigation with saline water increased soil salinity level and could be balanced annually; however, the leaf gas exchange of winter wheat was almost not significantly affected. The salinity caused by saline water irrigation negatively influenced the vegetative growth. The grain yield was increased by 24% and 32% under the FS and SF treatments compared to NI, while a minor reduction by 12% and 5% in yield under these treatments was recorded compared with the FF treatment. The SALTMED model was calibrated and validated to predict yield, and the high value of the R-2 reflected a good agreement between modeled and observed values, indicating that the SALTMED model was able to simulate grain yield under the alternate irrigation strategies in the regional climate condition. Supplementary irrigation using saline water at the stem elongation stage and fresh water at the flowering stage is a practical solution to achieve comparable yields with low risk of salt accumulation for winter wheat particularly in the NCP.

We investigated the spatial-temporal change of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) based on the daily meteorological variables of 22 meteorological stations and the annual streamflow of three hydrological stations from 1970 to 2018 in the WRB. The contributions of key meteorological variables to ETa changes and the sensitivity coefficient are also quantified. The temporal trends of ETa showed an increasing trend from 1970 to 2018, and the spatial distribution of ETa increased from northwest to southeast in the WRB. Increasing trends were detected in the multi-year average, spring, and winter, but only a few stations passed the significance test. Summer and autumn showed a decreasing trend, but this trend was not significant. Solar radiation is the most sensitive meteorological variable, followed by vapor pressure, wind speed, and mean temperature. Vapor pressure contributes the most to ETa changes, followed by solar radiation. In general, vapor pressure (relative humidity) is the dominant meteorological factor affecting ETa in the WRB. In addition to meteorological factors, the ETa is also affected by combined and complicated factors caused by precipitation and human activities. As an important part of the hydrological cycle, ETa has important research significance for water resources management, economy, agriculture, and ecology and results of this study may be helpful to further clarify the climate change and human activities impacts on the basin hydrological cycle.																				2073-4441				FEB	2021	13	3							303	10.3390/w13030303	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13030303													WOS:000615642100001

Micronutrient deficiency in plants is associated with their declining level in soils, limited bioavailability, and the presence of abiotic stressors that interfere with the healthy growth and development of plants. Field experiments were conducted in lentil sown at two different times to study the effects of foliar-applied Zn, B, and Fe on grain yield and grain concentrations of micronutrients. Field experiments were undertaken in clay loam soil (Aeric Haplaquept) in eastern India during the winter seasons of 2018-2019 and 2019-2020, to cultivate rainfed lentil with residual moisture. Lentil crop was sown on two different sowing dates (in November and December) to expose one of the crops to higher temperature and moisture stress. Foliar spray of zinc (Zn 0.5%), boron (B 0.2%), and iron (Fe 0.5%) was applied either individually or in combination at the preflowering and pod development stage. These three micronutrients are essential humans. They have also been reported to alleviate plant stress. Our study reported that foliar spray of micronutrients twice during lentil growth stages can fortify seeds with required nutrients and also alleviate stress in late-sown conditions.

Here, the Illumina MiSeq sequencing (16 S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer [ITS]) and meta-genomic GeoChip sequencing technologies were used to explore the alterations of microbial compositions and functional genes in the topsoil (0-10 cm) following grassland restoration. Grassland restoration increased the relative abundances of the copiotrophs (such as Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes), but reduced the oligotrophs (including Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes), suggesting that microorganisms shifted from oligotrophic to copio-trophic groups during grassland restoration. The changes in microbial eco-strategies were also supported by the meta-genomic GeoChip sequencing data. In the early restoration years, the microbial functional genes were dominant with recalcitrant C degradation (pgu, glx, lig, mnp), C fixation (accA, aclB, acsA, rbcL), N fixation (nifH), and nitrification (amoA, hao) related genes. In the later restoration years, the microbial functional genes were dominant with labile C degradation (amyA, amyX, apu, sga, abfA), and denitrification (nosZ, nirS, narG, napA) related genes. The changes in microbial functional genes were mainly related to soil biotic factors (microbial biomass C and N, as well as C-and N-acquiring enzymes). Finally, we made a framework illustrating the changes in microbial eco-strategies and soil C, N cycling processes. This is the first attempt to link microbial functional genes with microbial eco-strategies by incorporating soil microbial meta-genomic information during grassland restoration.

J	Arun, PV; Karnieli, A				Arun, Pattathal V.; Karnieli, Arnon			Deep Learning-Based Phenological Event Modeling for Classification of Crops	REMOTE SENSING												Classification of crops using time-series vegetation index (VI) curves requires appropriate modeling of phenological events and their characteristics. The current study explores the use of capsules, a group of neurons having an activation vector, to learn the characteristic features of the phenological curves. In addition, joint optimization of denoising and classification is adopted to improve the generalizability of the approach and to make it resilient to noise. The proposed approach employs reconstruction loss as a regularizer for classification, whereas the crop-type label is used as prior information for denoising. The activity vector of the class capsule is applied to sample the latent space conditioned on the cell state of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) that integrates the sequences of the phenological events. Learning of significant phenological characteristics is facilitated by adversarial variational encoding in conjunction with constraints to regulate latent representations and embed label information. The proposed architecture, called the variational capsule network (VCapsNet), significantly improves the classification and denoising results. The performance of VCapsNet can be attributed to the suitable modeling of phenological events and the resilience to outliers and noise. The maxpooling-based capsule implementation yields better results, particularly with limited training samples, compared to the conventional implementations. In addition to the confusion matrix-based accuracy measures, this study illustrates the use of interpretability-based evaluation measures. Moreover, the proposed approach is less sensitive to noise and yields good results, even at shallower depths, compared to the main existing approaches. The performance of VCapsNet in accurately classifying wheat and barley crops indicates that the approach addresses the issues in crop-type classification. The approach is generic and effectively models the crop-specific phenological features and events. The interpretability-based evaluation measures further indicate that the approach successfully identifies the crop transitions, in addition to the planting, heading, and harvesting dates. Due to its effectiveness in crop-type classification, the proposed approach is applicable to acreage estimation and other applications in different scales.

Mongolian pine (P. sylvestris) plantation has been imple-mented for decades in desert regions of northwest China, achieving significant improvements in combating soil erosion and desertification. However, the characteristics of water use pattern and transpiration of P. sylvestris at different ages remain poorly understood. We investigated seasonal variations in water uptake pattern and transpiration of different-aged P. sylvestris (4-, 10-, and 18-yr) based on stable isotope and sap flow measurements over two growing seasons. The canopy transpiration of P. sylvestris and its discrepancy between the dry and rainy season increased with increasing stand age. The 4-yr P. sylvestris extracted water mainly from shallow soil layer (0-120 cm) across the growing season (63.21-69.40%). In contrast, the older P. sylvestris (10-and 18-yr) dis-played a greater degree of ecological plasticity as they shifted water uptake to deeper soils and groundwater in times of drought. In the rainy season, 10-, and 18-yr P. sylvestris extracted water predominantly from shallow soil layer (68.62%) and shallow plus middle soil layers (0-200 cm) (66.04%), respectively; in the dry season, however, they both shifted main water sources to the middle plus deep soil layers (120-300 cm) (61.29% and 63.45%). The older P. sylvestris also increased absorption of groundwater in the dry season, leading to more severe soil desiccation and faster groundwater decline. The changes in water use patterns of P. sylvestris were related to differences in root distribution and biomass, seasonal variations of plant transpiration, and changes in soil water condition. As a consequence, the variations and controls of age-dependent plant water uptake and transpiration should be considered to implement the corresponding management measures in future reforesta-tion activities to achieve sustainable development goals.																			0168-1923	1873-2240				MAR 1	2023	330								109320	10.1016/j.agrformet.2023.109320	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2023.109320		JAN 2023											WOS:000922869400001

Methods Plant water sources and leaf physiological parameters of Hippophae rhamnoides and two neighbor species were investigated in pure and mixed plantations. Then, N stable isotope and N content of leaves were analyzed to examine the N facilitation of H. rhamnoides to neighbor species. Finally, interactions between plant water sources and N acquisition were detected using the dissimilarity analysis. Results H. rhamnoides and Pinus tabuliformis obtained water from similar soil depths, whereas, water sources were partitioned between H. rhamnoides and Ulmus pumila. Compared with pure plantations, P. tabuliformis and H. rhamnoides could not maintain a stable net photosynthetic rate (P-n) during the dry period in mixed plantation. However, H. rhamnoides and U. pumila in mixed plantation could alleviate drought effect on P-n through stomatal adjustments, comapred with pure plantations. Furthermore, H. rhamnoides facilitated N to neighbor species regardless of their water source relations, however, this facilitation only significantly improved the leaf N content of U. pumila. Conclusions Water source partitioning, stomatal adjustment, and N facilitation promoted stable coexistence of NFS and neighbor species in water- and N-limited environments.																			0032-079X	1573-5036				DEC	2019	445	1-2			SI		289	305		10.1007/s11104-019-04301-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-019-04301-9		OCT 2019											WOS:000490878100004

Further study on the key enzyme will provide usmore comprehensive understanding about its function. In the present study, we identified a yellow and spotted leaf 1 (ysl1) mutant in rice exhibiting a yellow-green leaf phenotype throughout the whole developmental stage and a spotted leaf phenotype at seedling and tillering stages. Genetic analysis indicated that a single recessive gene was responsible for the phenotype of ysl1 mutant. Map-based cloning showed that the mutation site was located at the region of 105.4-kb between RM572 and L3 on the short arm of chromosome 1. Sequence analysis revealed that a point mutation (C-to-T) happened in the coding region of candidate gene YSL1 (LOC_Os01g17170) which caused an amino acid change in MPEC. YSL1 was expressed mainly in photosynthetic tissues and organs, and its encoded protein was transported into the chloroplast with a signal peptide. The phenotype of ysl1 returned to normal phenotype of wild type after introducing the wild-type YSL1 gene. Based on the evidence from different levels, we confirmed that the phenotype of ysl1 was caused by a single nucleotide substitution of YSL1 which is allelic to YGL8, OsCRD1, and YL-1, and demonstrated the spotted leaf at seedling and tillering stages as a novel phenotype of the MPEC mutants in rice.					changhui, sun/HLP-6466-2023														0735-9640	1572-9818				AUG	2019	37	4					253	264		10.1007/s11105-019-01152-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11105-019-01152-7													WOS:000518539700001

However, it is unclear whether sustainability are. An 8-year corn yield in these three systems was investigated at Zhenyuan of East Gansu in 2008 to 2015, and a 4-year location study with FMRF and FMCF, three corn hybrids, and three densities was conducted at Pengyang of South Ningxia from 2012 to 2015. The results indicated that FMRF with rain-harvesting efficiency of 65.7%-82.7% makes rainwater infiltrate deep soil and soil moisture double increase in furrow root-zone. The 8-year average grain yield increased by 22.7% in FMRF and 14.5% in FTMCF compared with FMCF. In the 4-year field trail, rainfall and its seasonal distribution highly impacted grain yield and water-use efficiency (WUE), but order of importance for grain yield and WUE increases were density > mulching type > hybrid. Grain yield and WUE increased by 20.0% and 3.45 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) and 12.0% and 2.97 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) from low to medium density and medium to high density; ET and grain yield and WUE increased simultaneously from low to medium density, however grain yield and WUE improved but ET changed slightly from medium to high. Soil water content of the 0-200 cm layer during growing season was always higher in FMRF than in FMCF, and ET did not differ. FMRF kept more than 50-90 mm soil water in the 0-200 cm during grain filling period. Neither higher grain yield in the FMRF depleted soil water, nor resulted in soil desiccation regardless of the year of precipitation. On the contrary, the FMRF kept much more water into soil layers at corn harvest, and negative effects to soil water balance were not observed. Thus, the package of FMRF combining with close planting and density tolerance hybrids is climate-smart technique for coping with droughts and ensuring corn yield in rainfed areas.					wang, shuying/HHZ-4516-2022; Li, Shangzhong/HHD-1335-2022	Yang, Xiaomei/0000-0002-5199-7889													0378-3774	1873-2283				MAY 20	2019	217						1	10		10.1016/j.agwat.2019.02.031	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.02.031													WOS:000464296100001

To study the mechanism and process of shallow landslides and deep slip surface of terraces induced by extreme rainfall in loess hill and gully area, we conducted a laboratory model test of a terrace under artificial rainfall and used the Swedish arc strip method. The research results are as follows. The mechanism of shallow landslides in terraces is rill erosion accelerating rainfall infiltration, suspending the slope, and increasing its bulk density. The destruction process of shallow landslides can be roughly divided into six processes, and the earth volume of the landslide is 0.24 m(3). The mechanism of the deep sliding surface in terraces occurs under the combined action of water erosion and gravity erosion. The soil moisture content increases, which decreases the anti-sliding moment and increases the sliding moment, and the safety factor becomes less than the allowable limit for terraces. The deep sliding deformation area of the terrace was 0 similar to 1.0 m below the slope surface, slip surface radius was 1.43 m, the slip surface angle was 92 degrees, and the deep sliding surface began to form earlier than terraced shallow landslides. The displacement of the characteristic points increased from the slope top, to the slope center, and to the slope foot, with maximum displacements of 40.3, 15.5, and 6.0 mm, respectively.																				2073-4441				FEB	2021	13	3							270	10.3390/w13030270	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13030270													WOS:000615627900001

Furthermore, a large area of forest land has been changed to other land-use types like agricultural land is becoming a serious problem in Wondo Genet district. This situation largely contributed to deforestation and forest degradation. Hence, assessing the efficiency of adopting an alternative source of energy was found to be very important. This study was carried out to examine the role of biogas technology in fuelwood saving and carbon emission reduction in Wondo Genet district, southern Ethiopia. The multi-stage sampling procedure was followed to select sample households. A total of 152 households (54 adopters and 98 non-adopters) were involved in the household survey. Moreover, 25 test subjects were taken randomly from both adoption categories to conduct Kitchen Performance Test. Descriptive statistics and independent-sample t-test were used to analyze the data. Results showed that the major fuel sources for domestic use were plantation forest, natural forest, crop residue, and animal dung, accounting 46.71 %, 30.92 %, 15.13 %, and 7.24 %, respectively. Among the 54 sampled biogas plants, 32 (59.26 %) were a digester size of 6 m(3) whereas the remaining 22 (40.74 %) were of 8 m(3). The annual fuelwood saving potential of the technology was found to be 1423.06 kg with an emission reduction potential of 2.1 tons of CO2 e per biogas plant annually. Accordingly, all functional biogas plants were estimated to reduce about 91.63 tons of carbon emission annually. Generally, the biogas was found to be a promising technology in combating the pressure on forest resources and mitigating climate change. Therefore, the energy sector of the country should encourage households to adopt biogas plants that have more than 8 m(3) digester size to improve the fuelwood and carbon emission reduction potential.

Our GC/MS analysis revealed that the E. bivonae ethanolic extract contained essentially sitosterol, euphol, and lupeol. The 24-h LC50 was determined using the probit analysis method (LC50=357.11 mg l(-1)). Depending on this cytotoxicity test result, E. bivona extract induced a significant increase in Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), Glutathione-Peroxidase (GPx) activities, and lipid peroxidation (LPO) in A. salina larvae. In addition, the cytotoxicity effect of this extract had proved against the HEK293 cell lines in vitro. We suggest that the three compounds of E. bivonae extract (sitosterol, euphol, and lupeol) are the most responsible for this cytotoxicity. The possible application of this extract as an alternative natural antiproliferative is considered.

Here, the nitrogen/potassium ratio (N/K), free amino acid (AA) content, crude protein synthesis key enzyme activities (nitrate reductase (NR), glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT)) and crude protein content and yield in leaves, stems, and grain of forage maize, as well as the relationships among them, were explored. The results showed that the N/K of DL-40 (60,000 plants per ha(-1), 40% N topdressing at large trumpet stage) and DH-50 (75,000 plants per ha(-1), 50% N topdressing at large trumpet stage) significantly increased in leaves, stems, and grain, and correspondingly, NR, GS, and GPT activities in leaves, NR activities in stems, NR and GPT activities in grain, and delayed the decline in AA content. After tasseling, for DL-40 and DH-50 the crude protein content increased by 74.1% and 39.8% in leaves, respectively, 19.9% and 25.6% in grain, respectively, and crude protein yield increased by 16.7% and 35.2% in leaves, respectively, and 23.5% and 25.9% in grain, respectively. There were significant quadratic parabolic relationships of NR, GS, and GPT activities with proportion of topdressing. There was a significant relationship of crude protein content with NR activity in leaves, with NR, GS, and GPT activities in stems and with GPT activity in grain. Regulating the key enzyme activity by adjusting the density and fertilization can significantly improve the crude protein yield of forage maize. Treatments DL-40 and DH-50 significantly increased crude protein content and yield by increasing plant N/K, NR activity in leaves, NR activity in stems, and GPT activity in grain, but slowed the decrease in AA content in leaves, stems, and grain.																				2077-0472				MAR	2023	13	3							715	10.3390/agriculture13030715	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13030715													WOS:000952823000001
J	Zhang, K; Zhao, FN; Zhang, B				Zhang, Kai; Zhao, Funian; Zhang, Bo			Soil Water Content at Planting Affects Determining Agricultural Drought for Rainfed Spring Wheat	ATMOSPHERE												Agricultural drought often refers to water deficit in soil caused by a shortage of precipitation during a specific period in crop growing season, thus leading to final crop production failure. However, soil water content during planting may be related to the final yield of crop. Therefore, the soil water content at planting could have a great impact on determining whether agricultural drought occurs during crop growth and development. In the current study, we used soil water content at planting at 0-50 cm depth, the spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield from 1987 to 2011, and precipitation from 1971 to 2011 at Dingxi, Gansu Province, China, intending to quantify the influence of soil water content at planting on determining agricultural drought for rainfed spring wheat. The response of spring wheat yield to growing season precipitation comprised two different linear relationships defined by whether the soil water content at planting was greater or less than 100 mm. With the identical amount of soil water content at planting and precipitation during main growth period, a higher soil water content at planting resulted in a greater spring wheat yield. Soil water content at planting was more effective than growing season precipitation for increasing spring wheat yield. According to the probability distributions of soil water content during planting and growing season precipitation, we concluded that 28.6% of the years studued involved agricultural drought for rainfed spring wheat in the Dingxi of Gansu province, China. This analysis, which quantified the relative importance of soil water content at planting (29.97 kg ha(-1) per mm) and during growing season precipitation (12.21 kg ha(-1) per mm) to determine yield and agricultural drought occurrence for spring wheat, suggests that improving the amount of soil water storage before crop planting is an important way to deal with agricultural drought.

However, the patterns of litter decomposition along with long-term secondary succession (over 100 years) are not well reported, especially concerning nutrient limitations on litter decomposition. Materials and methods To clarify the response of litter decomposition to changes in soil nutrient availability, we conducted four incubation experiments involving soil and litter and nutrient addition from different successional stages and investigated the changes in microbial respiration and litter mass loss. Results and discussion Our results revealed that microbial respiration increased with succession without any litter addition (1.19~1.73 mg C g(-1) soil), and litter addition significantly promoted microbial respiration (16.5~72.9%), especially in the early successional stage (grassland and shrubland). The decomposition rate of the same litter decreased with succession. In addition, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) addition showed significant effects on litter decomposition and microbial respiration; P addition promoted litter decomposition (2.4~15.3%) and microbial respiration (10.1~34.5%) in all successional stages, while N addition promoted litter decomposition (4.0~10.3%) and microbial respiration (5.4~27.2%) in all except the last stage of succession, which showed a negative effect on litter decomposition (- 7.5%) and microbial respiration (- 6.1%), indicating possible N saturation of litter decomposition and microbial respiration. Conclusions This work highlights that soil nutrient availability and successional stages need to be taken into account to predict the changes to litter decomposition in response to global changes.

J	Saltz, D; Cohen, S				Saltz, David; Cohen, Shlomo			Naturalness and principle pluralism in conservation	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												The concept of naturalness in biodiversity conservation remains polysemic, hampering decision-making. Although some conservationists claim ecosystem naturalness should be primarily determined by composition (integrity), others argue it should be determined by the extent of freedom from anthropogenic influence (autonomy). Problems arise when deciding how to treat affected ecosystems. Although the integrity school promotes benchmark-based active restoration, the autonomy school advocates a hands-off policy, making these 2 approaches contradictory. Moreover, expected global changes have promoted advocacy for ecosystem resilience, further complicating the debate. We argue that autonomy, integrity, and resilience are all morally valid. The conflict between them is contained by recognizing that full naturalness is an unattainable goal; restoration and rewilding processes are not an act of curation, but a contrary-to-duty obligation; principle pluralism can accommodate integrity, resilience, and autonomy as pro tanto principles in a case-specific approach; and naturalness, as an overarching value, gives unity to the plurality of principles.																			0888-8892	1523-1739				2023 AUG 14	2023										10.1111/cobi.14137	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cobi.14137		AUG 2023						37377162					WOS:001047692800001
J	Musa, AM; Horst, C				Musa, Ahmed M.; Horst, Cindy			State formation and economic development in post-war Somaliland: the impact of the private sector in an unrecognised state	CONFLICT SECURITY & DEVELOPMENT												Unrecognised internationally, Somaliland operates as a hybrid political order where a range of state and non-state entities provide security, representation and social services. Local business elites have impacted state formation after war by lobbying against a range of regulations, providing the government with loans and contributions rather than paying sufficient taxes, and by hindering the development of sound financial institutions. The success of such activities has led to de facto protectionism, where foreign ventures have had limited access to the Somaliland market. While such protectionism may have negatively impacted economic development and growth opportunities, recent engagements by multinational corporations in the Berbera port suggest that foreign private investments risk sparking violent conflict. In contrast, domestic businessmen have played a role in preventing or resolving violent conflict at crucial stages in Somaliland's recent history. Based on fieldwork in Somaliland, we argue that the impact of international corporate actors in post-war contexts needs to be understood in light of local culture and power dynamics, in which the political and economic roles of local business elites are central.																			1467-8802	1478-1174					2019	19	1			SI		35	53		10.1080/14678802.2019.1561621	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14678802.2019.1561621													WOS:000470258800003
J	Griotti, M; Ceccarelli, S; Roig-Jun, S				Griotti, Mariana; Ceccarelli, Sara; Roig-Jun, Sergio			Following the aridity: Historical biogeography and diversification of the Philodromidae spider genus Petrichus in South America	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION												Aridity conditions and expansion of arid biomes in South America are closely linked to the onset of Andean orogeny since at least 30 Mya. Among arid-associated taxa, spiders belonging to the genus Petrichus are found along the Andes mountains and across the diagonal of open formations of the Chaco and Cerrado domains. In this contribution, we asked whether Petrichus originated prior to the central Andean uplift and what historical processes have promoted their diversification. We time-calibrated the phylogenetic tree of Philodromidae and estimated the divergence times of Petrichus. Considering phylogenetic uncertainty, we assessed biogeographical hypotheses of the historical events associated with the diversification of these spiders in South America. Petrichus originated along the Pacific coastal deserts in the Central Andes during the Early Miocene. The species likely dispersed from the western to the eastern side of the Andes coincidently with the central Andean uplift. The diversification of these spiders is coeval with the expansion of open grassland formations during the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene. Multiple dispersal events occurred from the Monte desert to southern South America and eastward to Chaco between - 8 and 2.5 Mya. The Andes might have played a role as a corridor favoring geographical range expansions and colonization of new environments. In addition, we also suggest that Philodromidae might have an Oligocene origin or earlier. Future analyses based on further evidence and larger taxon sampling should be carried out to corroborate our findings.

Soil bacterial community structure and functioning in a long-term conservation agriculture experiment under semi-arid rainfed production system	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Soil microbial communities are important drivers of biogeochemical cycling of nutrients, organic matter decomposition, soil organic carbon, and Greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs: CO2, N2O, and CH4) and are influenced by crop and soil management practices. The knowledge on the impact of conservation agriculture (CA) on soil bacterial diversity, nutrient availability, and GHG emissions in semi-arid regions under rainfed conditions is vital to develop sustainable agricultural practices, but such information has not been systemically documented. Hence, studies were conducted for 10 years in rainfed pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.)-castor bean (Ricinus communis L.) cropping system under semi-arid conditions to assess the effects of tillage and crop residue levels on the soil bacterial diversity, enzyme activity (Dehydrogenase, urease, acid phosphatase, and alkaline phosphatase), GHG emissions, and soil available nutrients (Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium). Sequencing of soil DNA through Illumina HiSeq-based 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing technology has revealed that bacterial community responded to both tillage and residue levels. The relative abundance of Actinobacteria in terms of Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTUs) at phyla, class as well as genera level was higher in CA (NTR1: No Tillage + 10 cm anchored residue and NTR2 NT + 30 cm anchored residue) over CT (conventional tillage without crop residues). CA resulted in higher enzyme activities (dehydrogenase, urease, acid phosphatase, and alkaline phosphatase) and reduction in GHG emissions over CT. CA recorded 34% higher and 3% lower OC, as compared to CT, and CTR1, respectively. CA recorded 10, 34, and 26% higher available nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium over CT and CTR1, respectively. NTR1 recorded 25 and 38% lower N2O emissions as compared to CTR1 and CTR2, respectively. Whereas only NT recorded 12% higher N2O emissions as compared to CT. Overall, the results of the study indicate that CA improves the relative abundance of soil bacterial communities, nutrient availability, and enzyme activities, and may help to contribute to the mitigation of climate change, and sustainability in rainfed areas.																				1664-302X				JUN 15	2023	14								1102682	10.3389/fmicb.2023.1102682	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1102682								37396355					WOS:001015876600001
J	Ben Zvi, G; Seifan, M; Giladi, I				Ben Zvi, Gilad; Seifan, Merav; Giladi, Itamar			Reduced dispersal at nonexpanding range margins: A matter of disperser identity	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The evolution of dispersal at range margins received much attention recently, especially in the context of dynamic range shifts, such as those following climate change. However, much less attention has been devoted to study variation in and selection on dispersal at nonexpanding range margins, where populations are often small and isolated, and empirical test is dearly missing. To fill this gap, we tested whether dispersal of an ant-dispersed perennial plant (Sternbergia clusiana) is quantitatively and/or qualitatively reduced toward a nonexpanding range margin. We evaluated plant investment in dispersal structures (elaiosome), seed removal rates, and the relative abundance, activity, and behavior of low- and high-quality seed-dispersing ants in six sites ranging from mesic Mediterranean site to arid site (>600 to <100 mm of annual rainfall, respectively), which marks the southern range margin of the species. In a set of cafeteria and baiting experiments, we found that overall seed removal rates, the contribution of high-quality dispersers, maximum dispersal distance and dispersal-conducive ant behavior decreased toward range margins. These findings agree with a lower investment in reward by range margin plant populations, as reflected by lower elaiosome/seed ratio, but not by variation in the reward chemistry. More than variation in traits controlled by the plants, the variation in ant-seed interactions could be attributed to reduced presence and activity of the more efficient seed-dispersing ants in the marginal populations. Specifically, we found a mismatch between local distribution of potentially effective seed dispersers and that of the plant, even though those dispersers were observed in the study site. Interestingly, although the observed variation in the outcome of ant-seed interactions supported the prediction of reduced dispersal at nonexpanding range margins with small and isolated populations, the underlying mechanism seems to be incidental difference in the seed-dispersing ant community rather than a plant-mediated response to selection.

However, as a primary sensing organ, the plant root response to drought has not been well documented at the proteomic level. In the present study, we compared physiological alteration and differential accumulation of proteins in the roots of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) inbred line BTx623 response to Polyethylene Glycol (PEG)-induced drought stress at the seedling stage. Drought stress (up to 24 h after PEG treatment) resulted in increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent lipid peroxidation. The proline content was increased in drought-stressed plants. The physiological mechanism of sorghum root response to drought was attributed to the elimination of harmful free radicals and to the alleviation of oxidative stress via the synergistic action of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and polyphenol oxidase. The high-resolution proteome map demonstrated significant variations in about 65 protein spots detected on Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained 2-DE gels. Of these, 52 protein spots were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF MS) representing 49 unique proteins; the levels of 43 protein spots were increased, and 22 were decreased under drought condition. The proteins identified in this study are involved in a variety of cellular functions, including carbohydrate and energy metabolism, antioxidant and defense response, protein synthesis/processing/degradation, transcriptional regulation, amino acid biosynthesis, and nitrogen metabolism, which contribute jointly to the molecular mechanism of outstanding drought tolerance in sorghum plants. Analysis of protein expression patterns and physiological analysis revealed that proteins associated with changes in energy usage; osmotic adjustment; ROS scavenging; and protein synthesis, processing, and proteolysis play important roles in maintaining root growth under drought stress. This study provides new insight for better understanding of the molecular basis of drought stress responses, aiming to improve plant drought tolerance for enhanced yield.					li, Yu/HCI-9086-2022; Li, yu/HHZ-5236-2022; Chen, Hao/JHT-2948-2023; liang, liang/IAO-8518-2023	Chen, Hao/0009-0001-6480-7976; deng, xi ping/0000-0003-4577-9217; Kwak, Sang-Soo/0000-0002-8523-4388														1422-0067				DEC	2020	21	23							9174	10.3390/ijms21239174	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms21239174								33271965					WOS:000597586900001

Farmer-preferred and efficient strategies were identified through participatory modelling. The farmers' basin irrigation and scheduling (I), farmers' scheduling with furrow strategy (II), farmers' scheduling with alternate furrow strategy (III) and scheduling at 55% maximum allowable depletion (MAD) (IV) were evaluated for maize (Zea mais) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) using the FAO AquaCrop model. The results showed that I resulted in over-irrigation for maize and under-irrigation for barley, while IV resulted in maximum yield (8.6 t ha(-1) for maize and 2 t ha(-1) for barley) with maximum (1.8 kg m(-3)) and minimum (0.8 kg m(-3)) water productivity of maize under IV and I, respectively. A shift from I to IV (most preferred strategy by farmers) can save 8440 mm of water, which can possibly bring back 18.5 ha of land into irrigation. It is essential to interact with farmers on a basis of mutual comprehension to increase their trust and to lay a base for discussion, awareness raising and decision making. The transdisciplinary approach, Community of Practice (CoP) and Learning Practice Alliance (LPA) were appropriate platforms for participation. The increased crop yield and water productivity may contribute to ecological and economical sustainability and social equity. Copyright (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Ding, YX; Li, Z; Peng, SZ				Ding, Yongxia; Li, Zhi; Peng, Shouzhang			Global analysis of time-lag and -accumulation effects of climate on vegetation growth	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Climate dominantly controls vegetation over most regions at most times, and vegetation responses to climate change are often asymmetric with temporal effects. However, systematic analysis of the time-lag and time-accumulation effects of climate on vegetation growth, has rarely been conducted, in particular for different vegetation growing phases. Thus, this study aimed to leverage normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to determine the spatiotemporal patterns of climatic effects on global vegetation growth considering various scenarios of time-lag and/or accumulation effects. The results showed that (i) climatic factors have time-lag and -accumulation effects as well as their combined effects on global vegetation growth for the whole growing season and its subphases (i.e., the growing and senescent phases). However, these effects vary with climatic factors, vegetation types, and regions. Compared with those of temperature, both precipitation and solar radiation display more significant time-accumulation effects in the whole growing season worldwide, but behave differently in the growing and senescent phases in the middle-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere; (ii) compared to the scenario without time effects, considering time-lag and -accumulation effects as well as their combined effects increased by 17 %, 15 %, and 19 % the overall explanatory power of vegetation growth by climate change for the whole growing season, the growing phase, and senescent phase, respectively; (iii) considering the time-lag and -accumulation effects as well as their combined effects, climate change controls 70 % of areas with a significant NDVI variation from 1982 to 2015, and the primary driving factor was temperature, followed by solar radiation and precipitation. This study highlights the significant time-lag and -accumulation effects of climatic factors on global vegetation growth. We suggest that these effects need to be incorporated into dynamic vegetation models to better understand vegetation growth under accelerating climate change.																			1569-8432	1872-826X				OCT	2020	92								102179	10.1016/j.jag.2020.102179	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2020.102179													WOS:000550572100013
J	Ding, YX; Peng, SZ				Ding, Yongxia; Peng, Shouzhang			Spatiotemporal Trends and Attribution of Drought across China from 1901-2100	SUSTAINABILITY												Investigating long-term drought trends is of great importance in coping with the adverse effects of global warming. However, little attention has been focused on studying the detailed spatial variability and attribution of drought variation in China. In this study, we first generated a 1 km resolution monthly climate dataset for the period 1901-2100 across China using the delta spatial downscaling method to assess the variability of the Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI). We then developed a simple approach to quantifying the contributions of water supply (precipitation) and demand (potential evapotranspiration, PET) on SPEI variability, according to the meaning of the differentiating SPEI equation. The results indicated that the delta framework could accurately downscale and correct low-spatial-resolution monthly temperatures and precipitation from the Climatic Research Unit and general circulation models (GCMs). Of the 27 GCMs analyzed, the BNU-ESM, CESM1-CAM5, and GFDL-ESM2M were found to be the most accurate in modeling future temperatures and precipitation. We also found that, compared with the past (1901-2017), the climate in the future (2018-2100) will tend toward significant droughts, although both periods showed a high spatial heterogeneity across China. Moreover, the proportion of areas with significantly decreasing SPEI trends was far greater than the proportion of those with increasing trends in most cases, especially for northwestern and northern China. Finally, the proposed approach to quantifying precipitation and PET contributions performed well according to logical evaluations. The percentage contributions of precipitation and PET on SPEI variability varied with study periods, representative concentration pathway scenarios, trend directions, and geographic spaces. In the past, PET contributions for significant downward trends and precipitation contributions for significantly upward trends accounted for 95% and 72%, while their future contributions were 57 +/- 22%-149 +/- 20% and 95 +/- 27%-190 +/- 58%, respectively. Overall, our results provide detailed insights for planning flexible adaptation and mitigation strategies to cope with the adverse effects of climate drought across China.																				2071-1050				JAN 2	2020	12	2							477	10.3390/su12020477	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12020477													WOS:000516824600035

Proactive and reactive drought coping and adapting mechanisms enable farmers to be resilient against climate-induced drought and improve the drylands' current disaster preparedness and early warning systems. The aim of this study was to assess proactive and reactive farmers' drought coping strategies at household level in Raya Valley in southern Tigray, Ethiopia. Agro-climatological based 246 households were sampled from the lowlands, midlands and highlands of the study area. The most effective drought coping mechanisms were discovered using a multinomial logit model. The study area had endured mild to extremely severe drought in the last three decades. The association between the various drought severity and household heads were significant (chi(2) = 9.861, df = 3, p < 0.05). Proactive drought coping measures included collecting and storing pasture, conserving soil and water, weather prediction information to adjust saving and farming practices. Livestock feeding with roasted cactus cladode, small business loans, livestock selling, productive safety-net program, and food consumption reduction were the major reactive drought coping strategies. The proactive and reactive drought coping strategies identified in this study should be used to improve the existing disaster preparedness and early warning systems in the face of climate and weather extreme related impacts of climate variability and change.

Bala; Havrilla, Caroline A.; Huber-Sannwald, Elisabeth; Reed, Sasha C.; Weber, Bettina			Broader Impacts for Ecologists: Biological Soil Crust as a Model System for Education	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are a complex community of algae, cyanobacteria, lichens, bryophytes, and assorted bacteria, fungi, archaea, and bacteriophages that colonize the soil surface. Biocrusts are particularly common in drylands and are found in arid and semiarid ecosystems worldwide. While diminutive in size, biocrusts often cover large terrestrial areas, provide numerous ecosystem benefits, enhance biodiversity, and are found in multiple configurations and assemblages across different climate and disturbance regimes. Biocrusts have been a focus of many ecologists, especially those working in semiarid and arid lands, as biocrusts are foundational community members, play fundamental roles in ecosystem processes, and offer rare opportunities to study biological interactions at small and large spatial scales. Due to these same characteristics, biocrusts have the potential to serve as an excellent teaching tool. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the utility of biocrust communities as a model system in science education. Functioning as portable, dynamic mini ecosystems, biocrusts can be used to teach about organisms, biodiversity, biotic interactions, abiotic controls, ecosystem processes, and even global change, and can be easy to use in nearly every classroom setup. For example, education principles, such as evolution and adaptation to stress, or structure and function (patterns and processes) can be applied by bringing biocrusts into the classroom as a teaching tool. In addition, discussing the utility of biocrusts in the classroom - including theory, hypothesis testing, experimentation, and hands-on learning - this document also provides tips and resources for developing education tools and activities geared toward impactful learning.

AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Plastic mulching (PM) is regarded as a promising way to increase crop production. However, its reported that plastic mulching may decrease soil organic carbon content and been unfavorable for sustainable agricultural production. Confirmation of the effects of plastic mulching on soil water and organic carbon balances in a long term, including finding efficient ways to improve these balances, is crucial for the sustainability of agricultural production in semiarid rain-fed areas. We conducted field experiment (2010-2019), with spring maize and wheat as tested crops, using four treatments of plastic mulching (PM), plastic mulching with supplementary irrigation (PMI), plastic mulching with organic fertilizer application (PMO) and without mulching (CK). The results of this 10-year field experiment showed that PM with supplementary irrigation and organic fertilizer application not only significantly increased yield and Water productivity (WP) of wheat and maize, but also had a positive effect on soil water budget. The soil water budget of PMI, PMO and PM significantly increased by 120.4%, 96.1% and 105.8% in wheat and by 149.7%, 28.2% and 53.6% in maize, compared with CK, respectively. The improved soil water condition resulted in a significant increment of yield, PMI, PMO and PM increased yield by 122.8%, 89.7% and 67.0% for wheat, by 237.8%, 183.0% and 148.4% for maize, respectively, compared with CK. The 10 years of continuous PM significantly decreased soil organic carbon content (SOC) in 0-10, 10-20, 30-50 and 50-70 cm profiles by 22.5%, 19.1%, 15.6% and 15.3% for wheat, but had no significant effect for maize. The PMO significantly increased soil organic carbon content in 0-30 cm profiles for both wheat and maize, but the soil organic carbon budgets were negative for all four treatments, the PMO accelerated soil organic carbon loss for maize but had little effect for wheat compared with PM and CK. However, PMI, PMO and PM significantly in-creases crop bio-carbon production, resulted in the positive total carbon budget and significantly increased by 25.0, 15.0, 11.5 Mg ha(-1) in wheat and 105.1, 74.1, 74.0 Mg ha(-1) in maize, respectively, as compared with CK. These results suggested that the soil organic carbon budget differed for the two crops, also affected by water or organic carbon supplementation. A more appropriate crop rotation system with organic fertilizer application should be developed, to increase crop production and soil quality under plastic mulched condition in such semiarid rain-fed areas.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				FEB 1	2022	260								107303	10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107303	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107303		NOV 2021											WOS:000719296600002

(Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)	JOURNAL OF STORED PRODUCTS RESEARCH												The cowpea weevil, Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is one of the most pernicious pests of stored pulses. The use of fertilizers can induce resistance in plant organs against insect pests. In this study, chickpea grains were treated with chemical-(urea and phosphorus) and bio-fertilizers (mycorrhizal fungi, Azotobacter chroococcum, and Mesorhizobium ciceri Strain C-15), and cultivated at farm conditions. After harvesting the ripe grains, C. maculatus oviposition preference, population parameters and digestive enzymatic activity on treated grains and control were evaluated at controlled conditions. The cowpea weevil reared on the grains treated with A. chroococcum and mycorrhizal fungi showed the lowest pre-adult survival and amylolytic activity. Fecundity of females on control grains was higher than on A. chroococcum-treated grains. The oviposition preference on control grains was higher than on mycorrhizal fungi-treated grains. The intrinsic rate of increase (r) and net reproductive rate (R0) of C. maculatus on grains fertilized with A. chroococcum and mycorrhizal fungi were significantly lower than the control. The high amount of tannins and phenolics in the grains treated with A. chroococcum and mycorrhizal fungi can be the reason for their resistance to C. maculatus attack. Therefore, these two treatments have good potential to be included in chickpea fertilization programs and integrated management of C. maculatus.																			0022-474X	1879-1212				SEP	2023	103								102159	10.1016/j.jspr.2023.102159	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2023.102159		JUL 2023											WOS:001045919600001
J	Ke, FL; Ma, XL				Ke, Fulai; Ma, Xinglin			Responses of maize hybrids with contrasting maturity to planting date in Northeast China	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Maize sowing in semi-humid region of Jilin province is often delayed beyond the optimum planting time window because of soil water stress typically occurring before or during the planting season. Research was conducted at Lishu city, in Jilin province from 2009 through 2010 to determine the responses of maize hybrids with contrasting maturity to planting date. Three popular hybrids with contrasting different maturity, short-season hybrid Jidan27, mid-season hybrid Xianyu335, and full-season hybrid Zhengdan958 were planted in early May and mid-May and thinned to populations of 67,500 plants ha(-1). The results showed that durations from emergence to silking stage for all the hybrids consistently shortened as the planting delayed, but interaction effects of hybrids, planting date and year existed for the duration of silking to physiological maturity stage. The longer maturity hybrid usually had grain yield advantage over earlier maturity hybrid when planting at early May, but the earlier maturity hybrid often showed a greater yield than longer maturity hybrid when planting was delayed. The highest yield occurred at the treatment combination of the mid-season hybrid and delayed planting date, and the shorter season hybrid typically showed stable and higher grain yield across planting dates. Changes in grain volume per unit of land area among hybrids and planting date treatment combination were consistent with the changes in grain yields, indicating that the yield is determined usually by the sink capacity. Further research is needed to evaluate the effects of hybrids maturity and planting date on maize under different planting densities.																			2045-2322					AUG 4	2021	11	1							15776	10.1038/s41598-021-95328-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-95328-5								34349196					WOS:000684831300008

(Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)	JOURNAL OF STORED PRODUCTS RESEARCH												Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) is a damaging insect pest of chickpea seeds (Cicer arietinum L.) in storage. Using chickpea seed cultivars that are resistant to C. maculatus is one of the best techniques to reduce the infestation risks of this pest. We studied the differences in the resistance and susceptibility of seven commercial chickpea cultivars (Adel, Ana, Ata, Mansour, Nosrat, Saeed, and Samin) to C. maculatus based on the free-choice ovipo-sition preference, food consumption, life history/life table parameters, and digestive enzyme activity. Compared with other examined cultivars, C. maculatus oviposition preference and food consumption were highest on cul-tivars Ana and Adel, respectively. The developmental times were longest on cultivars Nosrat and Saeed, and shortest on cultivar Adel. Immature survival significantly differed among the cultivars, and was highest on cultivars Adel and Mansour, and lowest on cultivar Nosrat. The highest intrinsic rate of increase (r) was on cultivars Adel and Mansour, and lowest on cultivars Nosrat and Saeed. The amylolytic and proteolytic activities of fourth instar larvae were lowest on cultivar Ata. There were significant negative correlations between the seed hardness index with food consumption, immature survival, longevity, fecundity, r, and amylolytic activity of C. maculatus. As a result, the seed hardness is a main factor responsible for the resistance and susceptibility of the examined chickpea cultivars to C. maculatus, and this feature could be utilized to develop efficient control measures of the pest such as the production of transgenic seeds.																			0022-474X	1879-1212				DEC	2022	99								102040	10.1016/j.jspr.2022.102040	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2022.102040		OCT 2022											WOS:000879069600003

Annual production widely fluctuates throughout India due to erratic rainfall and suboptimal agronomic practices. Our novel approach utilizes the digital reflection of post-rainy (rabi) sorghum production systems in India to help better understand its spatiotemporal variations and enable the designing of geography-specific, climate-responsive system interventions (Genotype x Management; GxM). For this, we evaluated a range of farmer -relevant agronomic management practices across three soil types (shallow, medium, and deep vertisols) in combination with observed ranges of biological variability in sorghum cultivar characteristics. We used the crop growth simulation model Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to identify GxM combinations that can support the enhancement/ stability of post-rainy sorghum production systems in India. In general, we found the post-rainy sorghum systems would benefit from early-season sowing (16th -23rd September), short crop duration (compared to Maldandi (M35-1), commonly grown crop type), and medium fertilizer inputs (70-70 kg urea ha(-1 )as basal and top-dress application). In addition, site-specific crop management (M) and crop characters (G) optimizations would further enhance/ stabilize sorghum production. Simulations highlighted that in the poorly-endowed environmental context (i.e. shallow soils and low-rainfall areas), optimal GxM targets might involve water conservation GxM combinations, such as low plant populations and low fertilization along with low crop vigor and limited transpiration responsiveness. Details on site-specific optimum GxM are available in a web application at https://ls40.pef.czu.cz/maps/. To enable the use of the study outputs for certain applications (e.g. breeding), we separated the examined geographies based on similarities in optimum production characteristics and similarities in system response to GxM interventions into four "homogeneous system units " (HSU; i. e. geographical units within which reduced GxM interactions are expected). These HSUs intended to offer geography-specific targets to prioritize, test, and introduce distinct GxM interventions. We conclude that the APSIM-powered framework presented provides region-specific Genotype x Management options that could become a blueprint for defining quantitative breeding targets that achieve enhanced productivity/ stability of dry-season sorghum cultivation throughout India.

J	Falik, O; Mauda, S; Novoplansky, A				Falik, Omer; Mauda, Shachar; Novoplansky, Ariel			The ecological implications of interplant drought cuing	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Plants can perceive, integrate and respond to multiple signals and cues informative of imminent threats and opportunities. Here, we tested the hypothesis that unstressed plants are able to perceive and adaptively respond to stress cues emitted from their drought-stressed neighbours, and to induce adaptive responses in additional unstressed plants. Triplets of split-root Stenotaphrum secundatum plants were grown in rows. One root of the first plant was subjected to drought while its other root shared its pot with one of the roots of an unstressed target neighbour, which in turn shared its other pot with an additional unstressed target neighbour. Cuing from drought-stressed plants increased survival in both proximate directly cued and in more distant relayed-cued target plants under drought. Drought cuing lowered plant performance under benign conditions. Experiments with a Wilty mutant and fluridone treatments showed that drought cuing was greatly reduced in ABA-deficient Pisum Sativum plants. Synthesis. Our findings demonstrate for the first time the possible adaptive implications of both direct and relayed stress cuing among neighbouring plants, the possible cost of plant responsiveness to drought cues under benign conditions and the involvement of ABA in interplant drought cuing. The results suggest that interplant root communication of drought cues could have novel implications for plant interactions, survival and performance under both natural and agricultural settings.

Site-specific nutrient management: impact on productivity, nutrient uptake and economics of rice-wheat system	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES												A field experiment was conducted on Typic Ustochrept soil at the Crop Research Centre of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel University of Agriculture and Technology, Meerut, for two years (2014-15 to 2015-16) to evaluate site specific nutrient management (SSNM) against state recommendation (SR), integration of SSNM and SR with crop residue and farm yard manure. In terms of crop growth yield, nutrient uptake and economics, SSNM had significantly higher growth parameters, viz. number of tillers/m(2) and dry matter accumulation as compared to SR in both rice and wheat crops. Different yield attributes, viz. number of grains/panicle or spike, test weight of rice and wheat were also higher with SSNM. SSNM out yielded for rice, wheat and rice-wheat system (RWS) productivity by 10.3%, 14.1% and 11.9%. System N, P and K uptake under SSNM was also higher by 24.36, 9.55 and 36.01 kg/ha, respectively, compared to SR. An additional income of (sic)12953/ha over SR and maximum return/rupee invested ((sic)2.50) was also recorded with SSNM. Recycling of 5 t/ha rice and wheat straw residue along with SSNM had added advantage.

The genome of cultivated peanut provides insight into legume karyotypes, polyploid evolution and crop domestication	NATURE GENETICS												High oil and protein content make tetraploid peanut a leading oil and food legume. Here we report a high-quality peanut genome sequence, comprising 2.54 Gb with 20 pseudomolecules and 83,709 protein-coding gene models. We characterize gene functional groups implicated in seed size evolution, seed oil content, disease resistance and symbiotic nitrogen fixation. The peanut B subgenome has more genes and general expression dominance, temporally associated with long-terminal-repeat expansion in the A subgenome that also raises questions about the A-genome progenitor. The polyploid genome provided insights into the evolution of Arachis hypogaea and other legume chromosomes. Resequencing of 52 accessions suggests that independent domestications formed peanut ecotypes. Whereas 0.42-0.47 million years ago (Ma) polyploidy constrained genetic variation, the peanut genome sequence aids mapping and candidate-gene discovery for traits such as seed size and color, foliar disease resistance and others, also providing a cornerstone for functional genomics and peanut improvement.

However, few studies have assessed the linkages between soil properties and soil microorganisms. Soil microorganisms play a key role in soil nutrient turnover and plant community composition. To elucidate the responses of soil microbial community diversity and structure to intercropping, we conducted a 2-year experiment based on common vetch (CV) monoculture, rape (R) monoculture, and common vetch-rape intercropping (IRCV) with phosphorus (P) addition in alkaline soil. The microbial communities of bacteria and fungi in the rhizosphere soil were examined based on high-throughput sequencing targeting the 16S rRNA and ITS genes, respectively. In addition, we analyzed changes in soil properties and enzyme activities. Intercropping significantly increased dry matter (up to 98.86% and 81.48%, respectively dry matter is the aboveground biomass.) compared with common vetch monoculture. Intercropping decreased soil bulk density and pH and enhanced soil available phosphorus (AP) by 14.54-34.38%, 7.25-22.67%, soil organic matter (SOM) by 15.57-22.85, 6.82-15.57%, soil sucrase (Suc.) by 13.69-16.10%, 35.57-40.24% compared to monoculture common vetch and rape, respectively. However, bacterial alpha diversity was higher under rape monoculture than IRCV. In addition, the dominant soil bacterial phyla Proteobacteria (1.25-3.60%), Gemmatimonadetes (7.88-15.16%), Bacteroidetes (9.39-11.76%), and Rokubacteria (0.49-5.69%) were present at greater abundance with IRCV relative to those with CV and R, but phyla Chloroflexi was significantly decreased by 11.56-12.94% with IRCV compared with the other two treatments. The redundant analysis showed that SOM and AP were positively correlated with the dominant bacterial and fungal flora. Common vetch-rape intercropping resulted in increased biomass and altered soil microbial community composition as well as soil properties. Our results showed that intercropping systems positively improve soil microbial activity; this strategy could help in the cultivation of multiple crops and improve soil properties through sustainable production.

Investigating the spatial-temporal characteristics of extreme precipitation and predicting it quantitatively are critical for the flood prevention and water resources planning and management. In this study, daily precipitation data (1957-2019) were collected from 24 meteorological stations in the Weihe River Basin (WRB), Northwest China and its surrounding areas. We first analyzed the spatial-temporal change of precipitation extremes in the WRB based on space- time cube (STC), and then predicted precipitation extremes using long short-term memory (LSTM) network, auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and hybrid ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD)-LSTM-ARIMA models. The precipitation extremes increased as the spatial variation from northwest to southeast of the WRB. There were two clusters for each extreme precipitation index, which were distributed in the northwestern and southeastern or northern and southern of the WRB. The precipitation extremes in the WRB present a strong clustering pattern. Spatially, the pattern of only high-high cluster and only low-low cluster were primarily located in lower reaches and upper reaches of the WRB, respectively. Hot spots (25.00%-50.00%) were more than cold spots (4.17%-25.00%) in the WRB. Cold spots were mainly concentrated in the northwestern part, while hot spots were mostly located in the eastern and southern parts. For different extreme precipitation indices, the performances of the different models were different. The accuracy ranking was EEMD-LSTM-ARIMA > LSTM > ARIMA in predicting simple daily intensity index (SDII) and consecutive wet days (CWD), while the accuracy ranking was LSTM > EEMD-LSTM-ARIMA > ARIMA in predicting very wet days (R95P). The hybrid EEMD-LSTM-ARIMA model proposed was generally superior to single models in the prediction of precipitation extremes.

J	Liu, Y; Liao, YC; Liu, WZ				Liu, Yang; Liao, Yuncheng; Liu, Wenzhao			High nitrogen application rate and planting density reduce wheat grain yield by reducing filling rate of inferior grain in middle spikelets	CROP JOURNAL												Excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer and high planting density reduce grain weight in wheat. However, the effects of high nitrogen and planting density on the filling of grain located in different positions of the wheat spikelet are unknown. A two-year field experiment was conducted to investigate this question and the underlying mechanisms with respect to hormone and carbohydrate activity. Both high nitrogen application and planting density significantly increased spike density, while reducing kernel number per spike and 1000-kernel weight. However, the effects of high nitrogen and high plant density on kernel number per spike and 1000-kernel weight were different. The inhibitory effect of high nitrogen application and high planting density on kernel number per spike was achieved mainly by a reduction in kernel number per spikelet in the top and bottom spikelets. However, the decrease in 1000-kernel weight was contributed mainly by the reduced weight of grain in the middle spikelets. The grain-filling rate of inferior grain in the middle spikelets was significantly decreased under high nitrogen input and high planting density conditions, particularly during the early and middle grain-filling periods, leading to the suppression of grain filling and consequent decrease in grain weight. This effect resulted mainly from inhibited sucrose transport to and starch accumulation in inferior grain in the middle spikelets via reduction of the abscisic acid/ethylene ratio. This mechanism may explain how high nitrogen application and high planting density inhibit the grain filling of inferior wheat grain.

Amarender; Mittal, Surabhi; Singha Roy, Namrata; Kanjilal-Bhaduri, Sanghamitra			Time Allocation between Paid and Unpaid Work among Men and Women: An Empirical Study of Indian Villages	SUSTAINABILITY												The paper examines the time allocation between paid work (wage earning or self-employed work generally termed as employment work) and unpaid (domestic chores/care work generally termed as non-employment work) along with wage rates, imputed earnings, and occupational structure among men and women and according to different social groups to establish the extent to which the rural labour market is discriminated by sex and social group. The major objective of the paper is to show the differential in wage income between men and women in farm and non-farm activities. The paper also shows the division of time between employment and non-employment activities by men and women. The paper uses high-frequency data and applies econometric techniques to know the factors behind time allocation among different activities across gender. The study finds that males spend more hours on employment work and work at a higher wage rate than females. As a result, a vast monetary income gap between men and women is observed, even though women worked more hours if employment and non-employment activities are jointly taken into consideration. Time spent on employment work and non-employment (mainly domestic chores) has been found to vary significantly due to social identity, household wealth, land, income, education, and skill. The segregation of labour market by sex was evident in this study, with men shifting to non-farm occupations with greater monetary returns and continued dependence on women's farm activities.

J	Zhang, XY; Wang, K; Li, GL; Zheng, JY				Zhang, Xiaoyuan; Wang, Ke; Li, Gaoliang; Zheng, Jiyong			Infiltration holes enhance the deep soil water replenishment from a level ditch on the Loess Plateau of China	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												The introduction of exotic plants with high-water consumption and high-density planting have greatly changed the deep soil water environment on the Loess Plateau of China. Slope measures can intercept runoff to change slope soil water redistribution, however, the existing measures are not enough to improve deep soil water replenishment. Infiltration holes were used as a supplement of the existing slope measures. In this study, the effects of three different measures (the control without any measures, the level ditch, and the combination of level ditch and infiltration hole) on slope runoff and deep soil water redistribution were evaluated under field conditions. The results showed that the combined measure reduced the runoff by 44.1% and the sediments by 78.6% under an intense rainfall event compared with the control. After two rainy seasons, compared with the control and the level ditch, the combined measures significantly increased the soil water storage below 50 cm in the soil layer. Combining infiltration hole with level ditch improved the deep soil water replenishment within 30 cm from infiltration hole in a horizontal plane. Overall, the single-level ditch was insufficient to improve deep soil water replenishment, and the combined measure can more effectively intercept runoff to increase the water replenishment of deep soils. Our findings provide a new thinking in regulating and utilizing slope runoff to effectively improve deep soil water replenishment in arid and semiarid areas.

The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of long-term vegetation restoration on soil specific enzyme activity and to elucidate the relationship between specific enzyme activity and soil organic carbon (SOC) stability in the Loess hilly region of China. We determined three enzymes (saccharase, urease, and phosphatase) activity at 0-50 cm soil depths in plots under vegetation restoration for different lengths of time and supporting different vegetation types (grassland, 2-30 recovery years; shrubland, 5-47 recovery years; and forestland, 5-56 recovery years). SOCE and the geometric mean of enzyme activity (GMEA) at 0-20 cm depth initially increased and then decreased, whereas overall MBCE at 0-10 cm depth decreased with time. Overall, SOCE and GMEA decreased with soil depth, and were significantly and negatively correlated with SOC stability index (SI). In comparison, the relationship between MBCE and SI was non-significant. Overall, our data showed that specific enzyme activity and GMEA responded to vegetation restoration, with SOCE and GMEA negatively impacting SOC stability.

The present study investigates the net primary productivity (NPP) of two planted forests (Robinia pseudoacacia and Pinus tabulaeformis) and one natural forest (Quercus wutaishanica) from 1951-2100 using the LPJ-GUESS model in the Shaanxi province of China, which is a typical transition region from humid to dry climates. We found that: (1) Future annual precipitation and mean temperature exhibited nonsignificant and significant increasing trend in the region, respectively, indicating a drier climate in future; (2) although precipitation would increase in the dry area and decrease in the humid area, the NPP of each species in the dry area would be lower than that of the humid area, possibly because increasing temperature and CO2 concentration could restrain forest growth in dry areas and promote forest growth in humid areas; (3) of the three species, P. tabulaeformis forest exhibited the highest average NPP and R. pseudoacacia forest exhibited the highest NPP trend in both dry and humid areas, indicating these planted species may be adaptable to future climate change. Our results provide novel insights into the potential response of forest productivity to a changing climate in the transition region from humid to dry climates.																				2071-1050				MAY 2	2019	11	10							2856	10.3390/su11102856	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11102856													WOS:000471010300139

However, the water saved by the pits is mainly accumulated in the upper soil layer and thus easily loosed by ineffective evaporation. In this study, soil column simulation experiments were conducted to observe the effects of diversion holes on soil evaporation and soil water distribution in the loessial soil under two rainfall depths and different soil surface treatments. The soil samples were passed through a 2-mm sieve. The soil filling height and the soil volume was 140 cm and 54,652.17 cm3 in each soil column, respectively. For each treatment, there were three replicates. The results showed that gravel-mulching (GM), straw-mulching (SM), and diversion hole (DH) significantly decreased soil water evaporation compared with non-mulching (CK) under the different rainfall depths (P < 0.05). Under rainfall of 100 mm, the DH, GM, and SM caused an increase in the soil water content (SWC) in the 80-120 cm layer by 101.0%, 23.6%, and 65.5%, respectively. Under rainfall of 30 mm, CK increased SWC in the 0-40 cm layer, both GM and SM increased the SWC in the 0-60 cm layer, and the DH treatment allowed an increase in the 0-120 cm layer. Our results suggest that DH was a better measure to reduce soil evaporation and improve rainfall resource utilization, especially under high rainfall events. Our research provides scientific basis for the technology of soil deep spatiotemporal control and is of great significance to the balance and restoration of the ecological environment in the semi-arid Loess Plateau.

Investigating the spatiotemporal variations in extreme precipitation and exploring the potential drivers have implications for disaster risk reduction and water resource management. In this study, we analyzed the changes in nine extreme precipitation indices (EPIs) over the Wei River Basin (WRB) during 1957-2019. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of geographic factors (latitude, longitude, and altitude) on the spatial distribution of EPIs and the potential impact of ocean-atmosphere circulation on the temporal variability of EPIs. The results indicate that six EPIs present a downward trend and three EPIs show an upward trend, but all the trends are not significant. In the seasonal scale, max 1-day precipitation amount (RX1day) increases significantly in summer (P < 0.05), while the trends in max 5-day precipitation amount (RXSday) are not significant in all seasons. The period of about 8 years and less than 3 years were observed in most EPIs. The mean values of EPIs except consecutive dry days (CDD) gradually increase from northwest to southeast of the WRB. Latitude, longitude, and altitude are important factors affecting the spatial distribution of the extreme precipitation. Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) contribute the most to EPIs variation. Interdecadal and interannual oscillations occur between most EPIs and ocean-atmospheric circulation factors, but their phase relationships are different. Our findings highlight the importance of examining global and local driving factors of trend in regional extreme precipitation by a systematic approach, and help to further understand the precipitation changes in the WRB.

J	Zhang, R; Seki, K; Wang, L				Zhang, Rui; Seki, Katsutoshi; Wang, Li			Quantifying the contribution of meteorological factors and plant traits to canopy interception under maize cropland	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												A thorough understanding of crop canopy interception is crucial for understanding the relationship between water management and agriculture in water-limited regions. The factors that influence the interception process, such as meteorological conditions and plant traits, are diverse and uncertain. We divided meteorological factors and plant traits into three groups: precipitation-related meteorological factors (including precipitation event factors and raindrop factors), non-precipitation-related meteorological factors (air temperature, relative hu-midity, wind speed, etc.) and plant traits (leaf area index (LAI) and mean leaf inclination angle). The contri-butions of groups and each variable were then quantified with respect to canopy interception. This study was based on data from 80 events over four years (2017-2020). Measurements were taken under maize (Zea mays L.) cropland located on the southern Loess Plateau. The canopy interception (Ic) was calculated as the difference between precipitation and the sum of throughfall and stemflow and all of Ic was assumed to be lost to evapo-ration in the study. Results showed that the cumulative Ic of the 80 events was 395.9 mm, accounting for 39.7% of the contemporaneous total precipitation, but the mean proportion of canopy interception during each pre-cipitation event (Ic percentage) was greater at 57.6% because of the high interception percentage during light precipitation events (0-5 mm, totaling 37 events). Pearson correlations analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between Ic and precipitation-related meteorological factors (including precipitation amount, dura-tion, raindrop diameter (D50), terminal raindrop velocity (UV) (p < 0.01) and intensity, average downward force (F0) (p < 0.05)), whereas there was a significant negative correlation between Ic percentage and precipitation-related meteorological factors (p < 0.01) because precipitation amount was more affected by precipitation-related meteorological factors. When the results of different groups were compared, precipitation event fac-tors (amount, duration and intensity) and raindrop factors (D50, UV, F0,) made the highest contribution to explaining Ic (56.4%) and Ic percentage (28.3%), respectively. Both the unique effect and individual importance of plant traits to Ic and Ic percentage increased when considering the precipitation events which occurred close to the LAI measurement date. It is essential that short-term assessments are used if considering LAI in relation to Ic. Precipitation amount had the largest individual importance on Ic (30.2%, p < 0.01), whereas D50 was the analogous variable for Ic percentage (9.5%, p < 0.05). Our results confirmed that interception by the maize canopy accounts for an important portion of the total field water input. The data and information on the interception process presented in this study, should contribute to the understanding of the overall water balance in agroecosystem environments and improve knowledge of the interplay between agroecosystems and the environment.

However, there is little information available on how vegetation cover and terraces affect peak flow under extreme rainstorm conditions. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of vegetation cover and terraces on peak flow rate in small catchments under "7.26" extreme rainstorm conditions on the Chinese Loess Plateau. Thirty-two small watersheds located in Chabagou Watershed, Zizhou County, Shaanxi Province, were selected. The watershed areas ranged from 0.03 to 1.55 km(2). An aerial image with a resolution of 0.2 m was used to determine the land use and engineering practice by means of visual interpretation. The cross-section at the watershed outlets were investigated. At each cross-section, the flow depth, cross-sectional area of flow, wetted perimeter, and slope gradient of the channel were measured. Then, flow velocity was calculated using Manning's equation. Peak flow rate was calculated based on flow velocity and cross-sectional area of flow. The results showed that peak flow rates varied from 0.35 to 79.89 m(3)/s. Unit flood peak ranged from 4.3 to 153.0 m(3)/(km(2)center dot s). Peak flow rate was significantly correlated with watershed area, main channel length of the watershed, mean slope gradient of the watershed, and area percentage of the grassland at p < 0.01. The unit flood peak in the grassland and woodland decreased by 36% and 64%, respectively, compared with that in the watershed with the largest cropland component. Terraces reduced the unit flood peaks in the farmland and grassland by 48% and 39%, respectively. Thus, vegetation cover and terraces effectively reduced peak flow rate, and the susceptibility of the sampled watersheds to flood generation was evaluated as "average'' under extreme storm conditions. Our findings indicate that vegetation cover and terraces play an important role in soil conservation onsite and flood safety offsite under extreme rainstorm conditions.

A better understanding of the effects of different vegetation restoration types on SOC dynamics and fractions is critical in devising better policy to protect or enhance SOC stocks to improve soil quality and ecosystem function. In the present study, total, labile, and non-labile organic carbon (TOC, LC, and NLC), and carbon management index (CMI) of Cryptomeria fortunei (CF), mixed C. fortunei and Betula luminifera (MF), Neosinocalamus affinis (NA), and Camellia sinensis (CS) were compared with those of Zea mays field (ZM) on purple soil slopes in the Rainy Zone of Western China in order to develop more effective ways to implement vegetation restoration in the future. Different vegetation restoration types (CF, MF, NA and CS) increased TOC stock by 47.79%-118.31% and NLC stock by 56.61%-129.52% in the 0-50 cm soil layer compared with that of ZM. The direction and magnitude of changes in LC stock and CMI, however, depended strongly on the vegetation restoration type. Compared with ZM, CF had the largest increase of LC stock and CMI, whereas NA had the largest decrease of LC stock and CMI in the 0-50 cm soil layer. The LC:TOC ratio in four reforested species all declined significantly compared with that of ZM (p < 0.01), indicating decreased SOC activity after afforestation. The vegetation type and soil depth together explained more than 90% of the changes of TOC and its fractions in the plantations on purple soil slopes. Our study demonstrates that transforming the ZM into the CS is optimal to achieve the sustainable development goal, whereas transforming the ZM into the NA reduces the SOC activity and availability.

The response of L. chinensis to experimental warming can provide insight into its regeneration behaviour and the likely composition of future communities under warmer climate. We used MSR-2420 infrared radiators to elevate temperature and examined soil organic carbon and nitrogen and soil total phosphorus and determined the growth and physiology of L. chinensis in response to manipulations of ambient condition and warming. Results showed that compared with the control, L. chinensis subjected to warming treatment showed increased soil organic carbon and soil total nitrogen, but no significant difference was observed in soil total phosphorus. Climate warming increased shoot biomass, ecosystem respiration, and ecosystem water-use efficiency and reduced net ecosystem CO2 exchange and evapotranspiration. This result implies that warming could rapidly alter carbon fluxes. The effect of warming treatment significantly increased the contents of glucose and fructose and significantly inhibited sucrose synthesis. However, the TCA cycle was enhanced when citric and malic acid contents further accumulated. The results implied that L. chinensis probably enhanced its warming adaption mechanism mainly through increasing glycolysis consumption when it was exposed to elevated temperature. These results provide an understanding of the fundamental evidence explaining the primary metabolism of L. chinensis in response to warming and suggest the future impact of the terrestrial carbon-cycle feedback on global climate change.																			2041-2851					DEC	2019	11	6							plz073	10.1093/aobpla/plz073	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aobpla/plz073								32010438					WOS:000510159100013

Vascular wilt incited by Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lentis (FOL) is the most important disease of lentil worldwide. Knowledge of pathogen genetic structure is crucial to develop effective control strategies. In this study, the genetic structure of a collection of FOL isolates from Iran, Syria and Algeria was analysed using SSR markers. Eight markers were developed in this study and constitute a valuable resource for future molecular studies in FOL. Our results showed that there is a high molecular variation within regions, with isolates from North West Iran showing the highest gene diversity. Variation among regions also exists, with Iranian populations differing significantly from non-Iranian ones, having some private alleles. The clustering of isolates was well in agreement in both distance-based and model-based approaches suggesting the presence of seven ancestral FOL lineages, being three present exclusively in Iran while the others were distributed across all the regions. These results suggest that Iran could be a regional center of origin for FOL.

The influence of precipitation amount on plant community diversity and soil properties, in sandy desert ecosystems, is poorly studied. We chose the Artemisia ordosica community to examine how diversity, and the physical and chemical properties of soil vary in response to changes in precipitation. An in situ experimental platform was used to simulate total monthly precipitation at specific intervals in a desert-grassland region of northern China. The influence of precipitation on the community was investigated using three precipitation amount levels and two intervals. The relative density, coverage, and frequency of species in each experimental quadrat was analyzed for evaluating the community structure. Results showed that variability in precipitation amounts and intervals altered the species diversity in the A. ordosica communities. Increased precipitation amount enhanced whole community's species diversity via improving the richness of perennial forbs. Lengthening the precipitation intervals enhanced whole community's species diversity in the context of low precipitation amount but reduced species diversity in high precipitation amount condition. The precipitation patterns affected community species composition and diversity mainly by controlling soil moisture, secondly by changing the nitrogen and organic matter content of the surficial soils. This study revealed that effects of precipitation interval on the species diversity depended on annual precipitation amount and offer an innovative insight to evaluating the succession of desert ecosystems in the context of precipitation change in the future.					he, yingying/IAN-2674-2023	Yu, Minghan/0000-0001-6641-4167													1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2022	145								109701	10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109701	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109701		NOV 2022											WOS:000969804700001

Five OFSP genotypes were cultivated at three different locations following a randomized complete block design, and the yield, dry matter, beta-carotene, flavonoids, polyphenols, soluble sugars, starch, soluble proteins, and free radical scavenging activity were measured in the storage root. The results showed consistent variations in the nutritional traits of the OFSP storage root depending on both the genotype and the location, as well as on their interaction. Ininda, Gloria, and Amelia were the genotypes that provided the higher yield and dry matter, as well as the higher content of starch and beta-carotene; they also showed a high antioxidant power. These findings suggest that the studied genotypes have the potential to alleviate vitamin A deficiency. This study demonstrated a high possibility of sweet potato production for storage root yield in arid agro-climate regions with limited production inputs. Moreover, the results suggest that it is possible to enhance the yield, dry matter content, beta-carotene, starch, and polyphenols of the OFSP storage root through genotype selection.

In this study, we used Arabidopsis wild-type (WT) and an Atxdh1-knockout mutant defective in xanthine dehydrogenase1 (XDH1) to examine the role of degraded purine metabolites in the responses to wounding or UV-C stress applied to the middle leaves of the plant. Wounding or UV-C stress in the mutant resulted in lower fresh-weight, increased senescence symptoms, and increased cell death compared to WT plants. In addition, WT plants exhibited lower levels of oxidative stress indicators, reactive oxygen species, and malondialdehyde in their leaves than the mutant. Notably, transcripts and proteins functioning in the purine degradation pathway were regulated in such a way that it led to enhanced ureide levels in WT leaves 24h after applying the UV-C or wound stress. However, different remobilization of the accumulated ureides was observed after 72h of stress. In plants treated with UV-C, the concentration of allantoin was highest in young leaves, whereas in wounded plants it was lowest in these leaves and instead accumulated mainly in the middle leaves that had been wounded. These results indicated that in WT plants treated with UV-C, ureides were remobilized from the lower older and damaged leaves to support young leaf growth during the recovery period from stress. After wounding, however, whilst some ureides were remobilized to the young leaves, more remained in the wounded middle leaves to function as antioxidants and/or healing agents. UV-C radiation and wounding trigger purine degradation in old and damaged leaves to increase ureide accumulation. Impairment of purine degradation results in premature leaf senescence.

As an important post-translation modification, lysine acetylation participates in diverse biological functions. However, little is known regarding the quantitative acetylproteome characterization during wheat seed germination. In this study, we generated the first comparative proteomes and lysine acetylomes during wheat seed germination. In total, 5,639 proteins and 1,301 acetylated sites on 722 proteins were identified at 0, 12 and 24 h after imbibitions. Several particularly preferred amino acids were found near acetylation sites, including (KS)-S-ac, (KT)-T-ac, (KK)-K-ac, (KR)-R-ac, (KH)-H-ac, (KF)-F-ac, (KN)-N-ac, K-ac*E, FKac and K-ac*D, in the embryos during seed germination. Among them, (KH)-H-ac, (KF)-F-ac, FKac and (KK)-K-ac were conserved in wheat. Biosynthetic process, transcriptional regulation, ribosome and proteasome pathway related proteins were significantly enriched in both differentially expressed proteins and differentially acetylated proteins through Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis. We also revealed that histone acetylation was differentially involved in epigenetic regulation during seed germination. Meanwhile, abscisic acid and stress related proteins were found with acetylation changes. In addition, we focused on 8 enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, and found they were differentially acetylated during seed germination. Finally, a putative metabolic pathway was proposed to dissect the roles of protein acetylation during wheat seed germination. These results not only demonstrate that lysine acetylation may play key roles in seed germination of wheat but also reveal insights into the molecular mechanism of seed germination in this crop.																			2045-2322					AUG 10	2020	10	1							13454	10.1038/s41598-020-70230-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70230-8								32778714					WOS:000561123700030

Ranchers usually make impoundments, filled by runoff, to access freshwater for cattle supply in flat rangelands. The aim of this study was to understand rainfall-runoff generation and water storage temporal dynamics of impoundments in the Dry Chaco rangelands (Argentina). Thus, we instrumented six impoundments over three consecutive years and analyzed water storage data by developing a probabilistic model. For all impoundments, the rainfall event size thresholds to generate runoff presented values between 15 and 33 mm. Once they reached this threshold, the water gain response slopes presented values between 19 and 99 m(3) mm(-1). Loss patterns of water storage were described by exponential or linear functions. The predicted water storage dynamics presented high accuracy with the observed time series for all impoundments (RMSD between 380 and 1320 m(3)). The model only needs daily rainfall and air temperature to be run, making it easy to be used by scientists, ranchers, or local decision makers. It may be used to explore the hydrological functioning of small and seasonal water bodies of different sites of the world exposed to drought episodes caused by high climate variability and/or climate change.

The occurrence of the disease causes huge economic impacts because of its high fatality rate, trade ban and disease control costs. In the planning of vectors and vector-borne diseases like AHS, the application of Ecological niche models (ENM) used an enormous contribution in precisely delineating the suitable habitats of the vector. We developed an ENM to delineate the global suitability of AHSv based on retrospective outbreak data records from 2005 to 2019. The model was developed in an R software program using the Biomod2 package with an Ensemble modeling technique. Predictive environmental variables like mean diurnal range, mean precipitation of driest month(mm), precipitation seasonality (cv), mean annual maximum temperature ((o)c), mean annual minimum temperature ((o)c), mean precipitation of warmest quarter(mm), mean precipitation of coldest quarter (mm), mean annual precipitation (mm), solar radiation (kj /day), elevation/altitude (m), wind speed (m/s) were used to develop the model. From these variables, solar radiation, mean maximum temperature, average annual precipitation, altitude and precipitation seasonality contributed 36.83%, 17.1%, 14.34%, 7.61%, and 6.4%, respectively. The model depicted the sub-Sahara African continent as the most suitable area for the virus. Mainly Senegal, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Madagascar and Malawi are African countries identified as highly suitable countries for the virus. Besides, OIE-listed disease-free countries like India, Australia, Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia have been found suitable for the virus. This model can be used as an epidemiological tool in planning control and surveillance of diseases nationally or internationally.

This study selected a typical hilly-gully watershed of the Chinese Loess Plateau, the Zhifanggou watershed, to assess its long-term land use changes from 1938 to 2020 and their impacts on sediment yield by using the spatially distributed soil erosion model WaTEM/SEDEM with an average annual rainfall erosivity of 2000-2010. The results indicated that the main land use types in the Zhifanggou watershed were cropland, forest and grassland, and experienced two changing pe-riods: rapid agricultural reclamation during 1938-1958 and vegetation restoration during 1958-2020. The average annual sediment yields varied consistently with land use changes, showing evident changes from 51.84 t ha-1 y-1 in 1938 to 254.1 t ha-1 y-1 in 1958 and then to 4.27 t ha-1 y-1 in 2020. Correlation analysis suggested that sediment yield was closely related to the landscape indices of interspersion and juxtaposition index and Perimeter-area fractal dimension. The results indicated that increased vegetation cover and high spatial het-erogeneity of landscapes could alter sediment transport pathways, reduce sediment connectivity, and induce less sediment discharged into the river. Our findings could provide a good reference for optimizing soil and water conservation measures in the watershed.

This could be evaluated by measuring the response of SOC stability to soil physicochemical properties, soil enzyme activity, and environmental factors [recovery years, vegetation types, mean annual precipitation (MAP) and mean annual temperature (MAT)]. Here, the soils of shrub and forest land in different vegetation zones (steppe zone [SZ], forest-steppe zone [FSZ], and forest zone [FZ]) in the Loess Plateau of China were evaluated over different time periods. As the number of years increased, the active carbon fractions [very labile (Cl) and labile (C2) fractions of oxidizable carbon] and carbon management index (CMI) increased, whereas the SOC stability index (SI) decreased for both vegetation types in the three vegetation zones. However, the factors driving the changes in SOC stability varied with respect to the vegetation type and zone. Specifically, the rate of change in active carbon fractions was greater in FZ, whereas the rate of change of SI was higher in FSZ, and was correlated with higher MAP and MAT. Overall, the SOC stability decreased after vegetation restoration, with MAP, MAT, vegetation type, and years of recovery representing the main factors driving the changes in SOC stability. These results are expected to facilitate future studies on SOC aimed at enhancing the management of different vegetation zones during recovery in the Loess Plateau of China, in response to global climate change.

Insectivorous Bats in Eastern Mediterranean Planted Pine Forests-Effects of Forest Structure on Foraging Activity, Diversity, and Implications for Management Practices	FORESTS												Bats are primarily forest mammals and forest structure may affect their communities through the level of vegetation clutter. Pine plantations are typically even-aged managed forests that lack structural complexity. However, an understory layer can enhance the heterogeneity of these forests, making them suitable for several animal taxa. We hypothesized that species composition, richness, and foraging activity of insectivorous bats in pine plantations vary according to forest structure, specifically with the density of the understory. We measured pine density, Diameter at Breast Height (DBH), canopy closure, and vegetation cover of 29 pine (Pinus halepensis) plantations of the Judean Lowlands, Israel, and collected acoustic data on resident bats. We found that bat species richness and total activity increased in forests with large tree DBH and dense shrubs. Cluttered-habitat species foraged preferentially in forests with large tree DBH and high pine density, while open-habitat species preferred forests with well-developed canopies and dense shrubs. Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Eptesicus serotinus foraged in mature forests with well-developed bushes and these species are endangered in Israel. We conclude that mature planted pine forests with a well-developed under-canopy are suitable foraging grounds for insectivorous bats. Management plans for planted pine forests should consider our findings to support bat populations, including rare and endangered species.

Estimation of time to key phenological stages to guide management of subterranean clover (<i>Trifolium subterraneum</i> L.) in New Zealand	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												Coefficients that describe phenological development of subterranean (sub) clover (Trifolium subterraneaum L.) were derived from field and controlled environment experiments. These were combined with national scale historical climate data to estimate when key stages in the life cycle occur at different locations in New Zealand. Based on a 20 mm accumulated rainfall threshold in autumn, sub clover germination and emergence in eastern regions of the South and North Islands occurred between 10th and 24th March and later (similar to 31st March) in the cooler southern areas of the South Island, after 36 +/- 6.0(degrees)Cd and 115 +/- 9.0 degrees Cd, respectively. During this time the absolute photoperiod decreases from 13.7 h to 11.6 h (at latitude -34.3950) and from 14.4 h to 11.1 h (at latitude-47.2590). In spring, flowering was estimated to commence in August in North Island locations but from September onwards in South Island locations. The group of cultivars classified as 'Late' flowering by plant breeders were estimated to flower in the North Island starting by mid-August compared with mid-September to mid-October in southern (cooler) regions. The safe grazing period was estimated as 25% longer for 'Late' cultivars than the 'Early' cultivars. The quantification of these key phenophases can be extrapolated to different regions to enhance strategic management of weed control, grazing times and closing dates for seed set. This should enable increased species persistence of sub clover in pasture swards.

However, the understanding of ecosystem C storage and allocation and soil C stability along the grassland restoration chronosequence is insufficient. Thus, grasslands with different recovery years (0, 2, 5, 8, 11, 15, 18, 26, and 30 years) were chosen to monitor the dynamics of grassland ecosystem C storage, vegetation biomass C storage, soil C storage, and soil C stability in different soil depths, as well as a natural grassland (NG) reference. The results showed that aboveground biomass (AGB), belowground biomass (BGB), soil C storage, ecosystem C storage, the very labile fraction of oxidizable C (C1) (0-0.3 m layers), the labile fraction of oxidizable C (C2) (0-0.3 m layers), and the C management index increased with the recovery years. The vegetation species richness (R), vegetation species evenness (E), and vegetation species diversity (H ') initially increased, peaking at 18a and then decreasing with recovery years, but the soil C stability index (SI) at 0-0.3 m decreased over time. Additionally, the AGB, BGB, litter biomass (LB), R, H ', ecosystem C storage, and SI (0-0.3 m and 0.5-1.0 m layers) of 30-year grassland (GL30) showed no significant differences relative to those found in the NG. Furthermore, the soil C sequestration rate decreased with decreasing soil depth, while the soil C stability increased. These results suggest an optimistic outlook for the recovery of ecosystem C, but the soil C under these conditions is unstable, posing a risk to soil C sequestration in abandoned cropland on the Loess Plateau without appropriate management.

The source and transformation of groundwater nitrate in the intensive agricultural region must be understood. To elucidate the overall groundwater nitrate situation in Weifang (a typical representative intensive planting area), groundwater was sampled in 2009 and 2019, respectively. The hydrochemical compositions, nitrogen, and oxygen isotopes were measured to trace the source and transformation of the nitrate and quantify the proportional contribution of nitrate sources of groundwater (including sewage and manure (M&S), soil nitrogen (SN), chemical fertilizer (CF), and atmospheric deposition (AD)) in Weifang, China. The concentration of nitrates in groundwater generally decreased, and the groundwater quality improved significantly. The reasons for the variation of nitrate sources between 2009 and 2019 were likely due to the reduction in the amount of fertilizer, the number of livestock and the area of agricultural land. Land-use affected the concentration of nitrates in groundwater, which ranked as follows: vegetable greenhouse (VG) > winter wheat (WW) > drinking and domestic water (DW). Nitrification was the main process in the study area, and the effect of denitrification was weak. The study area was affected by mixed CF, SN, and M&S contaminants. According to the Bayesian isotope mixing model (SIAR), the proportional contribution of each source was ranked as follows: M&S (65.09%) > SN (17.97%) > AD (9.32%) > CF (7.63%). M&S is the main source of NO3? . In this research, identifying the source of nitrate pollution can cut off the source of pollution in a targeted way, ensure the safety of groundwater in Weifang and protect the agricultural environment of intensive agricultural area, which has significance for nitrate prevention and control in other places.

Drought stress is a major constraint on the growth and yield stability of soybean. Here, wild soybean (Glycine soja Siebold & Zucc.) was found to be more drought tolerant than cultivated soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) owing to morphological changes at the whole-plant level when subjected to 5% PEG-6000 treatment. Additionally, differential metabolites between two soybean genotypes seedlings leaves were analyzed at the cellular level using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics method. The root lengths of wild soybean increased and a high root/shoot ratio was maintained under drought stress conditions. In addition, the drought tolerance of wild soybean resulted from significantly greater levels of favorable metabolites, such as aromatic and serine family amino acids, as well as sugar and polylols involved in mannose and galactose metabolism, favorable secondary metabolites, and organic and fatty acids compared with cultivated soybean. At the same time, wild soybeans could maintain a stable TCA cycle and significantly enhance glycolysis to produce more energy and enhance the phosphate pentose pathway to create more reducing power. Our experimental results provide an important reference for the breeding of wild soybeans in arid environments, as well as methodological for utilizing wild soybeans and improving cultivated soybeans.																			1021-4437	1608-3407				MAY	2020	67	3					472	481		10.1134/S1021443720030085	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1021443720030085													WOS:000533078800008

Soil detachment by sediment-laden rill flow interpreted using three experimental design methods	CATENA												Soil detachment by rill flow is a key sub-process of rill erosion on hillslope areas; however, many studies have focused on soil detachment by clear rather than by sediment-laden rill flow and most studies have used the time and labor-consuming full-factorial design. This study used three experimental design methods, including the full factorial design, orthogonal design, and Taguchi method for indoor flume experiments to explore the process of soil detachment by sediment-laden rill flow. We analyzed and quantified the effects of the slope, flow discharge, and sediment load on the soil detachment rate by sediment-laden rill flow, and compared the results of the three experimental design methods to evaluate the applicability of the orthogonal design and Taguchi method in indoor flume experiments. The results showed that the flow discharge and slope were positively correlated with the soil detachment rate, while the sediment load was negatively correlated with it. The main effects of slope, flow discharge, and sediment load on the soil detachment rate, which were obtained from the three methods, had the same trends. The contribution rates of the flow discharge, slope, and sediment load were 46.20-47.83, 34.42-40.88, and 7.45-12.87%, respectively. The contribution rates of each factor obtained from the three methods were slightly different, but the overall ranked order was the same. The Taguchi method and the orthogonal design can effectively reduce the number of tests and ensure low relative errors. The prediction of the soil detachment rate from the Taguchi method was closer to the full-factorial design than the orthogonal design. Therefore, the Taguchi method proved was most efficient for flume experiments on soil detachment processes by the sediment-laden rill flow.					Delang, Claudio O. O/G-4130-2015	Delang, Claudio O.

Agricultural water management has significant influence on N2O emissions, hence the investigation of N2O emissions and the underlying production mechanisms under different irrigation managements would provide insights for N2O emission reduction and rational water usage. Here, we used the stable isotope method to evaluate the N2O isotopic signatures and the site preference, to clarify the N2O emission dynamics and the N2O source partitioning under different irrigation managements. We applied a furrow irrigation system and a drip irrigation system to maintain two different soil water conditions, allowance of dry-wet cycles and relatively stable water conditions, respectively. We found that the N2O emission was significantly decreased under drip irrigation compared to furrow irrigation with cumulated N2O flux of 526.3 mg m(-2) and 571.0 mg m(-2), respectively. In general, furrow irrigation with its dry-wet alternations promoted N2O emissions, while drip irrigation created a relatively stable environment that reduced N2O emissions. The intramolecular N-15 isotopic composition of N2O was used to partition the relative contribution of denitrification and nitrification. Nitrification dominated the processes driving N2O production under both treatments, nearly accounting for 76% up to 100% during the initial N2O peaks. Effective measure for mitigating N2O emissions from the investigated vegetable field could be obtained by replacing the traditional furrow irrigation with drip irrigation. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In the present research, the Penman-Monteith method was used to calculate ET0. The Mann-Kendall statistical test with the inverse distance weighting were used to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of the sensitivity coefficients and contribution rates of meteorological factors to ET0 to identify the mechanisms underlying changing ET0 rates. The results showed that the average ET0 for the Yanhe River Basin, China from 1978-2017 was 935.92 mm. Save for a single location (Ganquan), ET0 increased over the study period. Generally, the sensitivity coefficients of air temperature (0.08), wind speed at 2 m (0.19), and solar radiation (0.42) were positive, while that of relative humidity was negative (-0.41), although significant spatiotemporal differences were observed. Increasing air temperature and solar radiation contributed 1.09% and 0.55% of the observed rising ET0 rates, respectively; whereas decreasing wind speed contributed -0.63%, and relative humidity accounted for -0.85%. Therefore, it was concluded that the decrease of relative humidity did not cause the observed ET0 increase in the basin. The predominant factor driving increasing ET0 was rising air temperatures, but this too varied significantly by location and time (intra- and interannually). Decreasing wind speed at Ganquan Station decreased ET0 by -9.16%, and was the primary factor underlying the observed, local "evaporation paradox". Generally, increase in ET0 was driven by air temperature, wind speed and solar radiation, whereas decrease was derived from relative humidity.

However, limited data are available regarding the vertical distribution of SAP and SAK in deep soil profiles. In this study, we investigated the vertical variations in SAP and SAK in the critical zone on the Loess Plateau (50-200 m), China, by using classical statistical and geostatistical methods. The soil samples were collected from the top of the soil profile down to the bedrock by soil core drilling at five typical sites. SAP decreased throughout the profile. Whereas the SAK exhibited an increasing trend at all sites. The mean SAP concentration ranged from 0.94 to 32.56 mg kg(-1) at the sampling sites and the SAK concentration ranged from 44.51 to 229.31 mg kg(-1). At all of the sampling sites, SAK was significantly positively correlated with the depth and clay content, but there was a significantly negative correlation between the SAK and the sand content. The exponential model could fit most variograms of SAP and SAK at all sampling sites. The results obtained in this study to improve our comprehension of the SAP or SAK distribution conditions on the Loess Plateau, which is important for reasonable fertilizer application and vegetation planting practices.																			2045-2322					FEB 4	2021	11	1							3159	10.1038/s41598-021-82677-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-82677-4								33542419					WOS:000618049600117
J	Misganaw, CD; Bayou, WD				Misganaw, Chanie Derso; Bayou, Walelign Demisie			Tuber Yield and Yield Component Performance of Cassava (<i>Manihot esculenta</i>) Varieties in Fafen District, Ethiopia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												Since there is a variety of performance in cassava varieties for different agroecologies and there was no cassava production before in Ethiopian Somali regional state, Fafen district in particular. Investigation of the performance of higher tuber yielded cassava variety is the main concern for this study. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate tuber yield performance of cassava varieties. To do so, four varieties (kello, Qulle, Hawassa-4, and Chichu) were collected from Hawassa Agricultural Research Center and planted in Fafen district where there is arid climatic condition. Thirty-centimeter-long stakes were planted with 1 m x 1 m intra- and inter-row spacing with Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD). There were four rows, five plants per row and twenty plants per plot. Phenological, growth, and agronomic parameters were analyzed using SAS software; mean differences were compared using LSD at p <= 0.05. The result revealed that days to 50% establishment of the stem cuttings of variety "Qulle" were performed within 15.6 days. Among all varieties, Chichu and Hawassa-4 had the highest number of plant stand count, 88.3 and 86.7%, respectively. The highest number of mean multiplication ratio, secondary branches per plant, and mean plant height were obtained with variety "Qulle." With regards to tuber yield and its components, there was significant difference among understudied cassava varieties. The highest tuber yield (23.93 t/ha) was registered in variety "Hawassa-4" followed by Kello (19.90 t/ha) and Qulle (18.73 t/ha). It implies that variety "Hawassa-4" performed best in the test area and hence recommended in test area.																			1687-8159	1687-8167				APR 13	2020	2020								5836452	10.1155/2020/5836452	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/5836452													WOS:000530284300001

The two bean varieties were subjected to a 10% PEG simulated drought stress treatment, and the resultant physiological and biochemical characteristics of the leaves and roots were compared. The superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT) and other indicators were higher in 'HZYTJ' than in 'WZWJD'; additionally, the 'HZYTJ' exhibited slower changes in response to stress. The proline content in 'HZYTJ' changed slowly compared to that in 'WZWJD'. The transcriptome analysis of the two varieties showed that 1,361 and 1,447 genes were differentially expressed in 'HZYTJ' and 'WZWJD', respectively. DEGs were also analyzed via the KEGG pathway database, and 10 significant metabolic pathways were found to be involved in 'HZYTJ', while nine were found in 'WZWJD'. Using the GO function database, we found that 111 significant GO terms were involved in 'HZYTJ', whereas 125 were involved in 'WZWJD'. Through analysis of transcription factors, 487 DEGs were identified, of which bHLH transcription factors were the most abundant, followed by ERF, MYB-related, B3 and other transcription factor families. The selected and screened genes with DEGs were validated by qRT-PCR. These results provide a basis for further research into the drought resistance of the common bean.					wang, KiKi/JFZ-3334-2023; Wang, Xingyu/JNE-0602-2023; FENG, X/JPL-4188-2023; Jing, Jing/JSK-6237-2023; Liu, Shaobo/JUU-5767-2023; zhang, yan/JGL-8022-2023; wang, jiaqi/JSL-7112-2023; Li, Huizhen/JPX-2563-2023; zhang, jiayue/JUF-0129-2023; zhao, weiwei/JUU-6585-2023														1310-2818	1314-3530				JUL 19	2023	37	1							2238847	10.1080/13102818.2023.2238847	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2023.2238847													WOS:001035408100001

Materials and methods In this study, an indoor simulated rainfall experiment (90 mm.h(-1)) was used to study the characteristics of runoff and sediment production in sloping farmland under different straw lengths (3 similar to 5, 8 similar to 10, and 13 similar to 15 cm), different mulching amounts (1.5, 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 t.hm-2), and different mulching methods (surface mulching and mixed mulch). Results and discussion In the surface mulching, the average infiltration increased with increasing coverage and decreased with increasing length. In the mixed mulching, with the increase in coverage, the infiltration first increased and then decreased. When the coverage was less than or equal to 3.5 t.hm(-2), with increasing length, the infiltration first increased and then decreased. However, when the coverage was 4.5 t.hm(-2), with increasing length, the infiltration showed an increasing trend. The change trend of the average infiltration was opposite to the change trend of the cumulative runoff and sediment yield. When coverage and length were the same, the runoff cost of sediment control of the surface mulch was generally higher than that of the mixed mulch. Conclusions In this experiment, when the length was 3-5 cm and the amount was 4.5 t.hm(-2), the runoff was the lowest, and the infiltration was the highest under the surface mulch. The sediment production was the lowest when the length was 8-10 cm and the coverage was 3.5 t.hm(-2) under the mixed mulch. Straw mulching can reduce soil loess, which has certain significance for soil erosion control and the healthy and sustainable development of agriculture.

The roles of cytosolic O-acetylserine-(thiol)-lyase A (OASTLA), chloroplastic OASTLB, and mitochondrial OASTLC in plant selenate resistance were studied in Arabidopsis. Impairment in OASTLA and OASTLB resulted in reduced biomass, chlorophyll and soluble protein content compared with selenate-treated OASTLC-impaired and wild-type plants. The generally lower total selenium (Se), protein-Se, organic-sulfur and protein-sulfur (S) content in oastlA and oastlB compared with wild-type and oastlC leaves indicated that Se accumulation was not the main cause for the stress symptoms in these mutants. Notably, the application of selenate positively induced S-starvation markers and the OASTLs, followed by increased sulfite reductase, sulfite oxidase activities, and increased sulfite and sulfide concentrations. Taken together, our results indicate a futile anabolic S-starvation response that resulted in lower glutathione and increased oxidative stress symptoms in oastlA and oastlB mutants. In-gel assays of l-cysteine and l-seleno-cysteine, desulfhydrase activities revealed that two of the three OASTL activity bands in each of the oastl single mutants were enhanced in response to selenate, whereas the impaired proteins exhibited a missing activity band. The absence of differently migrated activity bands in each of the three oastl mutants indicates that these OASTLs are major components of desulfhydrase activity, degrading l-cysteine and l-seleno-cysteine in Arabidopsis.

In this study, the genome-wide transcriptomes from two supersweet corn cultivars (cv. Xuetian 7401 and Zhetian 11) with a nearly two-fold difference in kernel sugar content were carried out to explore the genes related to kernel sugar metabolism. In total, 45,748 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in kernels and 596 DEGs in leaves were identified. PsbS, photosynthetic system II subunit S, showed two isoforms with different expression levels in leaf tissue between two cultivars, indicating that this gene might influence sugar accumulation in the kernel. On the other hand, hexokinases and beta-glucosidase genes involved in glycolysis, starch and sucrose metabolism were found in developing kernels with a genome-wide transcriptome analysis of developing kernels, which might contribute to the overaccumulation of water-soluble polysaccharides and an increase in the sweetness in the kernels of Xuetian 7401. These results indicated that kernel sugar accumulation in sweet corn might be influenced by both photosynthesis efficiency and the sugar metabolism rate. Our study supplied a new insight for breeding new cultivars with high sugar content and laid the foundation for exploring the regulatory mechanisms of kernel sugar content in corn.

However, there has been less focus on the effects of soil aggregate fractions on the distributions of microbial communities. Here, we used phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis to explore the effects of different years of vegetation restoration (a 35-year-old Thymus mongolicus community (Re-35yrs) and a 2-year-old nongrazing grassland (Ug-2yrs)) on microbial communities within different soil aggregate sizes (< 0.25 mm, 0.25-1 mm, 1-2 mm, 2-3 mm, 3-5 mm and >5 mm). The results indicated that the amount of total PLFA in Re-35yrs was 10 times greater than that in Ug-2yrs. The soil aggregate stability increased with increasing duration of vegetation restoration. In Re-35yrs, the total PLFA shown an increase as the soil aggregate size increased, and the highest values were observed in 3-5 mm. Ug-2yrs differed from Re-35yrs, the soil microbial diversity was higher in medium particle sizes (1-2 mm and 2-3 mm) and lower in microaggregates (<0.25 mm and 0.25-1 mm) and macroaggregates (3-5 mm and >5 mm). Soil microbial diversity was highest in large particle size aggregates, which resulted in low environmental stress and strong stability. The same tendency was observed in the high values of cyc/prec, S/M and soil organic matter, which indicated a lower turnover speed (F/B) of fungal energy utilization and a higher fixation rate. After years of natural restoration, the soil microbial community generally transformed from nutrient-rich to heterotrophdominant, especially in microaggregates (reflected in the G(+)/G(-) ratio).																			2662-2289	2662-2297				MAR	2021	3	1					6	21		10.1007/s42832-020-0055-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42832-020-0055-1													WOS:000671272200002

Our study aimed to investigate the potential use of garlic as a treatment against Cryptocaryon irritans infection, using guppies (Poecilia reticulata) as the fish model. Garlic was freeze-dried, powdered, and used as it is or as an aqueous extract. The content of allicin, its main active ingredient, was 1.25 mg/g in garlic powder and 0.82 mg/ml in the aqueous extract, as determined by HPLC analysis. Aqueous garlic extract fully immobilized C. irritans theronts and protomonts within 20 and 40 min, respectively, following exposure to 5 mu l/ml. Treatment trials were performed, in which infected fish were fed with garlic powder-supplemented feeds (5%, 10%, or 20% supplementation), bathed in garlic aqueous extract (250 or 500 mu l/L) and subjected to a combined treatment which included both feeding and bathing. Results revealed that the tested treatments failed to cure the infection, though reduction in infection intensity on the caudal fin, but not on the gills, was evident following dietary supplementation with 20% of powdered garlic in one of the trials.

However, the regional impacts of revegetation on the dynamics of DSM and the sustainability of restoration remain essentially unknown. This paper synthesized 94 peer-reviewed publications containing 5668 observations from 55 sites that focused on cropland, natural grassland, planted shrubs and planted forests on the Chinese Loess Plateau to identify the regional impacts of revegetation on the DSM under different restoration periods and precipitation gradients. The results showed the following: (1) Planted forests and shrubs exerted a strong negative impact on DSM within the 1000-cm depth in which the average soil moisture in 100-500 cm was lower than the average permanent wilting point (8.6%), the choice of tree species greatly influenced the DSM depletion extent, and Platycladus orientalis and Hippophae rhamnoides were recommended to maintain a better DSM condition. (2) The temporal pattern of DSM dynamics within the 1000-cm depth under planted forests and shrubs exhibited a significant and continuous decrease in first 20 years and remained relatively stable after 20 years, in which the soil moisture was lower than the average permanent wilting point, and grassland showed no obvious trends among different restoration periods (0-30 yr). (3) The limiting effects of precipitation changed greatly along the soil profile under planted forests and shrubs, and the restrictions may begin to appear when the mean annual precipitation is less than 480 mm when considering the deep soil layer (200-1000 cm). (4) The change rate of DSM within 1000 cm in planted forests (-0.08 to -0.11 g 100 g(-1) yr(-1)) and planted shrubs (-0.05 to -0.20 g 100 g(-1) yr(-1)) was much higher than that in natural grassland (-0.02 to -0.07 g 100 g(-1) yr(-1)). Our results demonstrate that in arid and semiarid regions, the DSM in planted forests and shrubs was lower than or approached the average permanent wilting point and might limit the sustainability of vegetation restoration. When considering the joint effects between precipitation and vegetation type in deep soil layers, planted forests and shrubs are acceptable only when precipitation is greater than 480 mm, while grassland may be the best restoration type if precipitation is less than 480 mm.

Influence of 16 years of fertilization and manuring on carbon sequestration and agronomic productivity of groundnut in vertisol of semi-arid tropics of Western India	CARBON MANAGEMENT												Productivity of cropland soils, especially in arid and semi-arid tropics of India rigorously declined due to increasing losses of soil organic carbon (SOC) over the past decades. In the present study, we examined a 16-years long term experiment with continuous mono cropping rainfed groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) to quantify the influence of fertilization and manuring on yield sustainability and C sequestration potential on rainfed Vertisols of Western India. The treatments include, i) T1 = control; ii) T2 = 100% recommended dose of fertilizer [RDF-20:40:40 kg ha(-1) of N:P2O5: K2O]; iii) T3 = integrated nutrient management [INM- 50% RDF + compost 6 Mg ha(-1) + biofertilizers (BF)]; iv) T4 = organic nutrient source [compost 6 Mg ha(-1) + vermicompost (VC) 2 Mg ha(-1) + castor neem cake (CNC) 250 kg ha(-1) + BF + mulching]. Maximum mean groundnut pod yield (1.17 Mg ha(-1)) was recorded in T2 which was statistically similar to T4 (1.16 Mg ha(-1)). However, Mann-Kendall test for yield trend suggests the consistency in yield increase under T3 treatment during the last 16 years. The rate of pod yield enhancement was 27 kg ha(-1) for every Mg increase in profile SOC stock. The mean SOC concentration (g kg(-1)) of 1-m soil depth increased from 4.0 to 5.6 (40%) in T4 over control and the mean SOC sequestration rate was 0.63 Mg C ha(-1 )yr(-1). A minimum of 1.22 Mg C ha(-1 )yr(-1) input was needed to maintain SOC stock at its antecedent level (zero change). We conclude that combined use of chemical fertilizers along with locally available organic resources is essential for enhancing SOC storage while achieving sustainable crop productivity in semi-arid agro-ecosystem.

A rapid field survey followed by purposive sampling was used to identify research sites and 90 households representing agro-pastoral and pastoral production systems were selected purposively. Data were obtained from individual interview, own-flock ranking experiment, and secondary sources. Data management and analysis was done using MS-Excel and SPSS statistical software. The current findings show that goats were primarily kept for milk production (I = 0.33) followed by income generation (I = 0.27) and meat production (I = 0.17) in both production systems. Higher goat flock size per household was observed in the pastoral areas (94.62 +/- 30.21goats) as compared to the agro-pastoral (55.56 +/- 20.06) (p < 0.05). Coat color, appearance (conformation and body size), and pedigree (dam history for milk) are the top-ranked attributes for selecting breeding buck with index value of 0.28, 0.23, and 19, respectively. Milk yield, coat color, and appearance were also used for selecting breeding does with index values of 0.24, 0.20, and 0.17, respectively. Selection of breeding female is hardly practiced since all females are used for replacement, but breeding buck selection is done in a very young age primarily based on their coat color. The results obtained in this study could be used as input to design genetic improvement programs for goats in Aba'ala. Interventions are needed in expanding veterinary service, improved animal husbandry practices, and selective breeding to enhance the productivity of the goat populations.

This paper examines the potential of using Sentinel-2 time series data to derive spatially explicit estimates of crop production in an agroforestry parkland in central Burkina Faso. This type of landscape is characterized by agricultural fields where cereals (millet and sorghum) and legumes (cowpea) are intercropped under a relatively dense tree canopy. We measured total above ground biomass (AGB) and grain yield in 22 field plots at the end of two growing seasons (2017 and 2018) that differed in rainfall timing and amount. Linear regression models were developed using the in situ crop production estimates and temporal metrics derived from Sentinel-2 time series. We studied several important aspects of satellite-based crop production estimation, including (i) choice of vegetation indices, (ii) effectiveness of different time periods for image acquisition and temporal metrics, (iii) consistency of the method between years, and (iv) influence of intercropping and trees on accuracy of the estimates. Our results show that Sentinel-2 data were able to explain between 41 and 80% of the variation in the in situ crop production measurements, with relative root mean square error for AGB estimates ranging between 31 and 63% in 2017 and 2018, respectively, depending on temporal metric used as estimator. Neither intercropping of cereals and legumes nor tree canopy cover appeared to influence the relationship between the satellite-derived estimators and crop production. However, inter-annual rainfall variations in 2017 and 2018 resulted in different ratios of AGB to grain yield, and additionally, the most effective temporal metric for estimating crop production differed between years. Overall, this study demonstrates that Sentinel-2 data can be an important resource for upscaling field measurements of crop production in this agroforestry system in Burkina Faso. The results may be applicable in other areas with similar agricultural systems and increase the availability of crop production statistics.

As the largest tributary of the Yellow River, the Weihe River has been endowed with many ecological service functions. Among which, water yield can be a measure of local availability of water and an index for evaluating the conservation function of the region. This study aimed to explore the temporal and spatial variation of water yield and its influencing factors in the Weihe River Basin (WRB), and provide basis for formulating reasonable water resources utilization schemes. Based on the InVEST (integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs) model, this study simulated the water yield in the WRB from 1985 to 2019, and discussed the impacts of climatic factors and land use change on water yield by spatial autocorrelation analysis and scenario analysis methods. The results showed that there was a slight increasing trend in water yield in the WRB over the study period with the increasing rate of 4.84 mm/10a and an average depth of 83.14 mm. The main water-producing areas were concentrated along the mainstream of the Weihe River and in the southern basin. Changes in water yield were comprehensively affected by climate and underlying surface factors. Precipitation was the main factor affecting water yield, which was consistent with water yield in time. And there existed significant spatial agglomeration between water yield and precipitation. Land use had little impact on the amount of water yield, but had an impact on its spatial distribution. Water yield was higher in areas with wide distribution of construction land and grassland. Water yield of different land use types were different. Unused land showed the largest water yield capacity, whereas grassland and farmland contributed most to the total water yield. The increasing water yield in the basin indicates an enhanced water supply service function of the ecosystem. These results are of great significance to the water resources management of the WRB.

Z. Siahbidi, & A. Asgari. 2023. Determination of the optimal plant population and rapeseed genotype (Brassica napus L.) in western Iran. Int. J. Agric. Nat. Resour. 1-11. This study was conducted to determine the most suitable plant population and genotype of rapeseed at the Eslamabad-e-Gharb Research Station in western Iran during 2018-2020. The experiment was a factorial based on a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. Factors included four plant populations (20, 40, 60, and 80 plants m-2), and seven genotypes included four hybrids (Natalie, Rohan, Neptune, and Marathon) and three open-pollinated cultivars (Nafis, Nima, and Nilufar). The results show that the effect of the year was significant for all traits due to the difference in weather parameters over the two years of the experiment. ANOVA results shows that the effects of the plant population significantly affected plant height, the number of branches, the number of grains per pod, grain yield, grain oil, and oil yield. The effect of the genotype was also significant for all traits except oil yield. The effect of the interaction between the plant population and genotype on plant height, the number of branches, the number of grains per pod, the number of pods per plant, and 1000-grain weight was also significant. In general, open-pollinated cultivars at 60 plants m-2 and hybrid cultivars at 40 plants m-2 had higher grain yields.																			2452-5731						2023	50	1					1	11		10.7764/ijanr.50i1.2386	http://dx.doi.org/10.7764/ijanr.50i1.2386													WOS:000986160800001

ALGAL RESEARCH-BIOMASS BIOFUELS AND BIOPRODUCTS												Singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) is an interesting candidate for study due to the widely held opinion that it plays a key role in photoinhibition of photo system II (PSII). Many studies have been conducted to elucidate the exact role of singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) in photo-damage/repair, photoprotection, oxidative protection, and signaling. However, few studies have addressed the potential role of singlet oxygen as a marker for resilience to excess light environments. In the present study, we focus on the question of whether singlet oxygen resilience correlates with a strain's robustness in excess light environments. In order to address this question, two Nannochloropsis oceanica mutant strains, RB2 and RB113, both selected for heightened resilience to Rose Bengal (RB), a singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) photosensitizer, were characterized. This included the characterization of the photosynthetic apparatuses and specific growth rate in relation to photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) in the growth media. Both of the RB resistant mutants showed higher photosynthetic capabilities when grown in high PPFD environments relative to the wild type (WT) strain. This was evident by higher photosynthetic capacity (namely 27% higher in the RB113 mutant and 94% higher in the RB2 mutant) relative to the WT strain when grown in an optimal temperature and an excess light environment (25 degrees C and 500 photons mu mol s(-1) m(-2)). In addition to the increase in photosynthetic capacity in the excess light environment of 25 degrees C and 500 photons mu mol s(-1) m(-2), mutant strains also showed higher specific growth rates reflected by a 38% and 48% increase in the RB113 and RB2 mutant strains respectively. These results lead us to propose that Rose Bengal resilience in Nannochloropsis may serve as a marker for selecting species or strains better suited for growth in high light environments.					vonshak, avigad/F-1222-2012	Ben-Sheleg, Avraham/0000-0002-7093-7144; Vonshak, Avigad/0000-0001-8737-0749													2211-9264					AUG	2019	41								101562	10.1016/j.algal.2019.101562	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2019.101562													WOS:000472593800010

Effective parameters can contribute to the optimization of SMC models for accurate SMC prediction. Therefore, in this study, the relationships between the SMC and multifractal parameters (D-2, D-v, D-s, A(v), and F-v denote the correlation dimension, property of small probability and large probability, spectrum width, and symmetry of spectrum shape, respectively) of the soil particle size distribution (PSD) were explored in the hilly loess region of China. A grid method was adopted (20 m x 20 m, total = 384 points) to sample the SMC in the 0-40 cm and 40-80 cm soil layers on the second, eighth, and twelfth days after the first rainfall, which were defined as the early sampling (ES), medium sampling (MS), and late sampling (LS), respectively. We found that the variation in the SMC explained by the multifractal parameters increased as SMC decreased, where they accounted for 40.07% and 75.75% of the SMC in the 0-40 cm and 40-80 cm soil layers in LS, respectively. The variation in the SMC in the 0-40 cm explained by the multifractal parameters was lower than that in the 40-80 cm soil layer in all sampling stages. The equations fitted for the whole soil layer were significant in all sampling stages (P < 0.01). A(v) (31.95%) and D-v (13.59%) had negative correlations with SMC, and their relative importance values with respect to SMC were high in all sampling stages (P < 0.05). SMC at higher values had a positive correlation with F-v, whereas SMC at lower values had a significant positive correlation with D-2 and negative correlation with D-s, and these two parameters in the MS and LS stages explained more than 75% of the variation in the SMC in the 40-80 cm soil layer. These results suggest that the characteristics of the soil PSD can be described in detail by the multifractal parameters, which can directly reflect the SMC. Thus, we conclude that SMC is closely related to the multifractal parameters of the PSD (A(v), D-v, D-s, D-2, and F-v) and it can be applied to optimize SMC models.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is supporting its implementation through a community-centred intervention to generate positive impacts on livelihoods and increase socio-ecological resilience. An evaluation of socio-economic impacts was carried out based on household surveys conducted in the intervention areas in Niger, Nigeria, and Senegal between 2016 and 2020. Both diachronic (before and after the implementation) and synchronic (beneficiaries vs. control group) assessments of the socio-economic status of the communities were conducted using a set of indicators derived from the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework. Results revealed significant improvements in the socio-economic situation of the intervention populations. Household income improved after the interventions in all three countries, with positive significant differences against the control groups particularly in Nigeria and Senegal. In addition, perceived food insecurity significantly decreased in 2020 compared to 2016 observations, dropping from 46% to 15% in Senegal and from 69% to 58% in Niger. This study confirms the dual benefits of land restoration, both increasing vegetation cover and improving the livelihoods of rural communities.

CLIMATE CHANGE-INDUCED RANGE SHIFTS IN CHINESE ASH (<i>FRAXINUS CHINENSIS</i>) ALONG THREE GEOGRAPHICAL DIMENSIONS IN CHINA AT THE LATE 21<SUP>ST</SUP> CENTURY	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												In the present study, we establish a set of indicator systems to characterize the shifts in total range and core range of Chinese ash (Fraxinus chinensis) at three geographical dimensions under climate change scenarios in China by the year of 2070. The results show that current core range and total range areas were 1.3 x 10(6) km(2) and 3.3 x 10(6) km(2), accounting for 13.5% and 34.4% of the land area in China. The size of core range and total range areas will increase in varying degrees, depending on the CO2 emission concentration path. The average of future core range and total range areas were 1.95 x 10(6) km(2) and 3.7 x 10(6) km(2) across climate change scenarios, accounting for 20.3% and 38.5% of the land area in China. But, there was a difference in the centroid shift velocity and direction between the core and total ranges at the horizontal gradient. The average shift speed of total range is 11.39 km/decade toward northwest and that for core range is 9.32 km/decade toward northeast across climate scenarios. The average shift speed of the core range -9.05 m/decade downward and that for total range is 17.15 m/decade upward across climate change scenarios. This study indicates that the response of total range and core distribution range to climate change is not synchronous. Considering poleward or northward shift will underestimate about 2.2-20.1% for total range and 21.2-56.3% for core range. Thus, the study have important guiding significance for determining the potential shift route and adjust the shift speed for planting the tree species in response to future climate change. The indicator systems used here have a wide range of practicability and can applied to any species, region, or time.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2022	20	5					4499	4513		10.15666/aeer/2005_44994513	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/2005_44994513													WOS:001002702800021

This study was conducted to quantify the effects of vegetation characteristics induced by nitrogen addition on runoff and sediment yield. The Bothriochloa ischaemum (Linn.) Keng. was planted and applied NH4NO3 at levels of 0, 2.5, 5, and 10 g N m(-2) yr(-1) for three years with the bare soil for control. Then all treatments were subjected to simulated rainfall (1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mm min(-1)). Results showed that nitrogen addition increased plant coverage, height, and aboveground biomass of N-2.5, N-5 and N-10 treatments, while the root mass density of N-10 was the minimum. The grassplots significantly delayed runoff starting time, reduced runoff and sediment yield. With nitrogen addition increasing, runoff starting time delayed and runoff amount decreased, although no significant difference of runoff amount was found under the high rainfall intensity. Moreover, sediment yield would be well estimated by runoff mount, coverage and root mass density with a power function. 5 g N m(-2) yr(-1) seems the optimal nitrogen level in controlling soil loss due to its minimum sediment yield. The different effects of nitrogen addition on grassland community and soil erosion process identified in this study may facilitate the simulation and prediction of soil erosion in semiarid grasslands under future scenarios of global change.																			1230-1485	2083-5906					2021	30	1					215	226		10.15244/pjoes/119099	http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/119099													WOS:000581930900020

In the present study, soil water use efficiency (WUE) and crop yield of millet and soybean were investigated under nine fertilization regimes (no nitrogen (N) and no phosphorus (P) (CK), 120 kg ha(-1) N and no P (N1P0), 240 kg ha(-1) N and no P (N2P0), 45 kg ha(-1) P and no N (N0P1), 90 kg ha 1 P and no N (N0P2), 120 kg ha(-1) N and 45 kg ha(-1) P (N1P1), 240 kg ha(-1) N and 45 kg ha(-1) P (N2P1), 120 kg ha(-1) N and 90 kg ha(-1) P (N1P2), 240 kg ha 1 Nand 90 kg ha(-1) P (N2P2)) in the Loess Plateau, China. We conducted fertilization experiments in two cultivation seasons and collected soil nutrient, water use, and crop yield data. Combined N and P fertilization resulted in the greatest increase in crop yield and WUE, followed by the single P fertilizer application, and single N fertilizer application. The control treatment, which consisted of neither P nor N fertilizer application, had the least effect on crop yield. The combined N and P fertilization increased soil organic matter (SOM) and soil total N, while soil water consumption increased in all treatments. SOM and total N content increased significantly when compared to the control conditions, by 27.1-81.3%, and 301.3-669.2%, respectively, only under combined N and P application. The combined N and P application promoted the formation of a favorable soil aggregate structure and improved soil microbial activity, which accelerated fertilizer use, and enhanced the capacity of soil to maintain fertilizer supply. Crop yield increased significantly in all treatments when compared to the control conditions, with soybean and millet yields increasing by 82.5-560.1% and 55-490.8%, respectively. The combined application of N and P fertilizers increased soil water consumption, improved soil WUE, and satisfied crop growth and development requirements. In addition, soil WUE was significantly positively correlated with crop yield. Our results provide a scientific basis for rational crop fertilization in semi-arid areas on the Loess Plateau.

The N supply must maximize yield while minimizing environmental impact. In response to the above problems, we evaluated different approaches to nitrogen fertilizer management based on grain yield, economic benefits and environmental benefits of spring maize systems from 2017 to 2019 in a semiarid area of northwestern China. The four treatments included solid granular urea with a split application (UR), one-time application of a mixture of controlled release and solid granular urea (CU), straw return with the combination of controlled release and solid granular urea (CUS) and control (CK). From the perspective of agricultural production, compared with the CK, high yields (>15 Mg ha(-1)) were guaranteed in the other treatments. Considering both the environment and the economy, compared with the UR treatment, the CU treatment not only improved the economic efficiency of maize cultivation (increased by 4.9%-12.1%) but also significantly decreased the net global warming potential (NGWP) and carbon footprint (CF) (decreased by 21.1-21.7% and 17.8-23.1%, respectively). At the same time, the CU treatment optimized the proportions of N2O emissions at different growth stages and reduced the risk of emissions caused by high temperatures and rainfall in the middle and late stages of maize growth. Compared to the CU treatment, although the CUS treatment increased CO2 and N2O emissions (increased by 35% and 51%, respectively), the accumulation of soil organic carbon (SOC) was enhanced by straw return, which offset the negative impact of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions and significantly reduced the NGWP and CF compared to values for the other three treatments (decreased by 51% and 50%, respectively). With a comprehensive consideration of environmental impacts and economic benefits, the combination of solid granular urea (SGU) and controlled release urea (CRU) with the straw return is an environmentally friendly, high-yielding, high-economic benefit and low-emissions production technology for arid and semiarid areas.

Zand., were collected from the Loess Plateau and a 65-day cultivation experiment was performed to study the effects of five kinds of nutrient solutions (Knop, Murashige-Skoog (MS), Benecke, Part and Hoagland), two kinds of carbohydrates (glucose and sucrose) and three kinds of plant growth regulators (thidiazuron (TDZ), 6-benzylaminopurine (6-BA) and naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA)) on the coverage, plant density, and plant height of moss crusts. The main conclusions are as follows. (1) All Knop, MS, Benecke, Part and Hoagland nutrient solutions improved the coverage and plant density of moss crusts to different degrees and the promotional effects of the Hoagland nutrient solution were most significant. (2) Glucose and sucrose could promote the formation of moss crusts, but they inhibited the development of moss crusts at concentrations greater than 10 g/L. (3) With an increase in concentration, the effects of TDZ on the development of moss crusts changed from "enhanced" to "inhibited". Regardless of whether the concentration was high or low, 6BA had no significant effects on the growth of moss crusts, and NAA reduced the development of moss crusts. Results suggest that nutrient solutions (e.g. Hoagland), low concentration carbohydrates solutions, and some plant growth regulators (e.g. 1 mg/L TDZ) enhance the development of moss crusts in Loess Plateau under the appropriate environmental conditions.

However, little is known about the growth responses of tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum L.) to the practices adopted in semiarid areas of Loess Plateau in Northwest China. To address the concerns, a long-term field experiment was conducted in 2015-2017. Four fertilization levels, namely, high fertilization level (N-P2O5-K2O: 120-90-60 kg ha(-1), HF), moderate fertilization level (80-60-40 kg ha(-1), MF), low fertilization level (40-30-20 kg ha(-1), LF), and zero fertilization level (ZF), were applied to hole-sown tartary buckwheat with whole plastic mulching, in comparison to the control with no-mulching and zero fertilization (CK). Several key growth-influencing indicators were measured in the consecutive experimental years, including soil temperature (T-s), soil water storage (SWS), leaf area index (LAI), dry matter (DM), and grain yield. The results showed that in different precipitation years, 2015 (193 +/- 23 mm), 2016 (149 +/- 19 mm), and 2017 (243 +/- 28 mm), the ZF, LF, MF, and HF treatments had the potential to optimize T-s in 0 similar to 25 cm soil layers (at 5 cm interval). The four treatments improved SWS in 0 similar to 300 cm soil layers by 3.5% and increased soil water consumption in the pre-anthesis period by 22.4%, compared with CK. Moreover, the four treatments shortened the pre-anthesis growth period by 0.4 similar to 5.4 d, while extended the post-anthesis growth period by 5.7 similar to 10.0 d, giving rise to an overall extension of 0.6 similar to 5.0 d for a whole growth period of tartary buckwheat. Furthermore, the ZF, LF, MF, and HF treatments increased LAI by 4.4 similar to 225.3% and DM weight by 41.5 similar to 238.0%. The rain yield of the four treatments was increased by 14.0 similar to 130.4%, and water use efficiency (WUE) was improved by 11.3 similar to 102.7%, especially for the LF treatment, compared with CK. The study indicated that the technique of hole-sowing and plastic mulching combined with a low fertilization rate was an effective measure for tartary buckwheat to optimize crop growth and to boost grain yield and WUE on semiarid lands.																				2076-3417				FEB	2023	13	4							2232	10.3390/app13042232	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app13042232													WOS:000938165900001

Both fruit juices were characterized based on pH, sugar, titratable acidity, total phenol, and organic acid contents. The fermentation process was made at previously optimized fermentation temperature of 24.8 degrees C, pH of 3.4, inoculum concentration (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) of 10.16% (v/v), and Lantana camara fruit juice concentration of 10.66% (v/v). The final wine was characterized as having pH of 3.47 +/- 0.04, 4.6 +/- 0.02 g/L sugar equivalent to dextrose, 0.33 +/- 0.006% titratable acidity (w/v citric acid), total phenol of 696.1 +/- 22.1 mg/L equivalent to gallic acid, and 4.35 +/- 0.4 mg/mL organic acid equivalent to citric acid composition. Predominant color intensity, ethanol, methanol, total sulfite, and sensory value of the final wine were measured as 48.07 +/- 2.66% of yellowish color, 8.6 +/- 0.68% (v/v), 124.4 +/- 9.5 mg/L, 129.94 +/- 4.04 mg/L, and 8.65 +/- 0.92, respectively. The blended Lantana camara fruit enhanced total phenol, color, and sensory value of the final wine. Titratable acidity and methanol and sulfite contents of the final wine are in an acceptable limit compared to standards for commercial wines. Utilizing cactus pear fruit by incorporating Lantana camara fruit for health-enhancing functional food development such as fruit wines could solve the current postharvest loss of both fruits and be a means of alternative beverage.

In this study, the researchers investigated the impact of various land-use types (farmland, orchards, grasslands, and facility lands) on soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions in the Qaidam Basin of China's Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The soil samples were taken from the 0-10 and 10-20 cm depths. The particulate organic carbon (POC) and mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) fractions of various land uses have been measured. The results revealed that grasslands had the greatest POC/SOC ratio (0.59), with POC accounting for the majority of the SOC fraction. In contrast, all other land-use types (facility land, orchards, and farmland) had greater MAOC/SOC ratios than POC/SOC. The facility land had the highest SOC content (17.75 g kg-1), and orchard had the lowest (8.51 g kg-1). The grassland had the highest POC content (9.82 g kg-1) at a depth of 0-10 cm. The trend for MAOC content among the various land-use types was facility lands > farmlands > grasslands > orchards. The soil pH was also observed to be moderately alkaline, with an average of 8. The orchard has the highest bulk density (BD), measuring 1.38 g cm-3. The grasslands contained the highest amount of total nitrogen (TN) (2.2 g kg-1) while the agricultural fields contained the highest amount of total phosphorus (TP) (1.16 g kg-1). In addition, facility lands showed the highest level of microbial activity compared to other land-use types. According to the findings, SOC, POC, and MAOC fractions had considerably positive associations with TN and microbial biomass carbon (MBC), but were significantly negatively associated with metabolic CO2. The findings imply that different land-use types can have a considerable impact on the quality and amount of soil organic carbon, which has consequences for soil health and ecosystem processes. The findings also highlight the significance of long-term land management practices that promote the preservation and enhancement of soil organic carbon in various land-use systems.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				OCT	2023	231								107273	10.1016/j.catena.2023.107273	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.107273		JUN 2023											WOS:001019661900001

The task is much more daunting in the northwestern part of India where the over exploitation of natural resources is a major concern for sustainable agricultural planning. An integrated farming system (IFS) encompasses various enterprises such as crops, dairy, poultry, and fisheries can offer a myriad of benefits in terms of enhanced farm productivity, profitability, and environmental sustainability. Hence, the study hypothesized that the complementary interaction between the different enterprises would improve food production and reduce negative environmental outcomes. Therefore, production potential and environmental sustainability in terms of energy efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions, and eco-efficiency of nine IFS models, namely, crop enterprise (M2); crop + dairy (M3); crop + dairy + fishery (M4); crop + dairy + fishery + poultry (M5); crop + dairy + fishery + poultry + duckery (M6); crop + dairy + fishery + poultry + duckery + apiary (M7); crop + dairy + fishery + poultry + duckery + apiary + boundary plantation (M8); crop + dairy + fishery + poultry + duckery + apiary + boundary plantation + biogas unit (M9); crop + dairy + fishery + poultry + duckery + apiary + boundary plantation + biogas unit + vermicompost (M10), were compared with the rice-wheat system (M1; the existing system). All the IFS models were tested between 2018 and 2021. The results revealed that the highest food production (61.5 Mg ha(-1)) was recorded under M10 followed by M9 (59.9 Mg ha(-1)). Concerning environmental sustainability, the combination of crop + dairy + fishery + poultry + duckery + apiary + boundary plantation + biogas unit + vermicompost (M10) recorded considerably higher energy output (517.6 x 10(3) MJ ha(-1)), net energy gain (488.5 x 10(3) MJ ha(-1)), energy ratio (17.8), and energy profitability (16.8 MJ MJ(-1)) followed by M9. Furthermore, the M10 had the lowest greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity (0.164 kg CO2 eq per kg food production). However, M9 had the highest eco-efficiency index (44.1 INR per kg GHG emission) followed by M10. Hence, an appropriate combination of diversified and complementary enterprises in a form of IFS model is a productive and environmentally robust approach for sustainable food production in the northwestern part of India.

Mulching improves soil water status and root water transport for increasing grain yield. Therefore, a field experiment with five treatments: (1) plastic film mulching ridge and non-mulching furrow (RF), (2) full plastic mulching with conventional flat cultivation (FPM), (3) straw mulching with conventional flat cultivation (SM), (4) partial plastic mulching with conventional flat cultivation (PPM) and (5) non-mulch with conventional flat cultivation (CK) was conducted during 2018 and 2019 in the eastern Loess Plateau of China. The total root biomass and the grain yield of all treatments were lower in 2019 than that of 2018 because of lower rainfall. However, all the mulching treatments improved root growth in both growing seasons mainly on the top 30 cm soil depth, which led to a distinct effect on grain yield as compared with CK. FPM produced the highest total root parameters in 2018 and at 45 DAS in 2019 due to the highest soil moisture content mainly in 0-30 cm soil depth. However, root biomass of FPM in 30-100 cm soil depth was lower than that of PPM, RF and SM because assimilate at reproductive stage was mostly for plant and seed growth than root growth, thus, there was negative correlation between grain yield and root biomass below 30 cm soil depth especially at grain filling stage. Over two growing seasons, soil moisture content (SMC) under FPM was 8.4 %, 0.6 %, 8.8 % and 11.1 % more than that of RF, SM, PPM and CK. FPM reduced soil evaporation, improved SMC, root distribution and transpiration rate, consequently, increased grain yield and net profit. Therefore FPM is an effective cropping system for improving the synchronization of soil water transport and root water uptake for maize production in rain-fed farming.						hao, weiping/0000-0003-1102-9119													0378-3774	1873-2283				NOV 1	2020	241								106340	10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106340	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106340													WOS:000569704000001

In this study, the Yan River Basin in the Loess Plateau was selected as the study area. The Mann-Kendall trend test, Pettitt's test, landscape pattern indices, and other methods were employed to explore characteristics and driving factors of land use change from 1990 to 2020. The results indicate that: (1) The areas of forest and impervious showed a significant increasing trend and suddenly changed in 2004. Change-point years for the area of cropland and grassland were 2005 and 1999, respectively. The main transition of land use types was from cropland to grassland and from grassland to forest. (2) Patches showed a trend towards regularization and simplification, indicating the strengthening of human activities' impact on spatial patterns. (3) Both social and natural factors jointly influenced land use change in the Yan River Basin. The Grain for Green (GfG) project was the main driving factor in accelerating land use transformation. This study aims to provide a basis for the scientific management of land resources and serve as an example for related research on land use change in the Loess Plateau.																				2073-445X				SEP	2023	12	9							1653	10.3390/land12091653	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land12091653													WOS:001071745300001
J	Balabukh, VO				Balabukh, V. O.			YIELD SHORTFALL OF CEREALS IN UKRAINE CAUSED BY THE CHANGE IN AIR TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION AMOUNT	AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND PRACTICE												Aim. To determine the trends in precipitation patterns, the precipitation productivity, and the cumulative impact of the change in air temperature and precipitation levels on cereal yield, including corn and spring barley, throughout the vegetation cycle stages. Furthermore, the examination of the alterations in the climate suitability, crop yield shortfall, and their specific characteristics within in the soil-climatic zones of Ukraine during 1981-2010 years Methods. In order to accomplish the outlined aims conventional and more specific research methods were used: 1) An analytical synthetic approach - to examine the existing state-of-the art research; 2) A statistical approach - to assess the intensity and significance of changes in agroclimatic conditions pertaining to crop cultivation; 3) A comparative analysis - to determine the specificities mentioned under 2) in soil-climatic zones of Ukraine and in different stages of plant development; 4) A climatic approach - to characterize precipitation levels and to evaluate their impact on crop productivity; 5) modelling - to assess the effect of changes in precipitation amounts on the productivity of corn and spring barley, to assess the cumulative impact of the variations in surface temperature and precipitation on climate productivity and yield shortfall of these crops; 6) application of abstract and logical method - to formulate the generalizations and draw conclusions based on the findings.Results. During the years 1981-2010, Ukraine experienced changes in precipitation patterns and increased air temperature throughout the vegetation cycle of corn and spring barley in different soil-climatic zones. These changes had implications for climate suitability and crop productivity. In the Polissia region, although there were increases in precipitation during most of the crops` growth cycle, the changes were insignificant and had a minimal impact on crop productivity, except during certain periods. Similarly, the cumulative coefficient of temperature and precipitation productivity showed low probability for changes in climate suitability and yield shortfalls in the entire Polissia region, maintaining avorable cultivation conditions for corn and spring barley. In the Forest-Steppe region, precipitation changes varied. There was an increase in the amount of precipitation in the western Forest-Steppe. The speed of these changes was 10-20 % in 10 years in certain areas, leading to decreased corn and spring barley productivity by 3-6 % over the same duration. The central Forest-Steppe witnessed increases and decreases in precipitation levels during specific crop development stages, negatively impacting productivity. The eastern Forest-Steppe had increased precipitation deficits during the vegetation cycle, resulting in reduced productivity. Overall, the changes in precipitation and the increased air temperature had unfavorable effects on field crop cultivation in the Forest-Steppe, particularly in the central region. Corn yield shortfalls of 3-5 % and spring barley yield shortfalls of 2-3 % were observed over each 10 years. In general, however, for spring barley favorable agroclimatic conditions persisted throughout the Forest-Steppe, and corn cultivation remained favorable in the western and satisfactory in the central and eastern areas. In the Steppe region, changes in precipitation levels were minimal, with fluctuations of 5 % over each 10 years. However, significant variations in moisture levels occurred during specific crop development stages. An increase in precipitation levels during the stage milky ripeness-middle dough phase of corn resulted in 3 % yield decrease over each 10 years. Spring barley benefited from increased precipitation during the tillering stage and decreased precipitation during the stagemilky ripeness and middle dough stages, leading to higher (precipitation) productivity. Overall, the considerable increase in air temperature and changes in moisture conditions in many cases adversely affected corn and spring barley cultivation, especially in the southern Steppe. These changes led to a 7-10 % decrease in corn climate suitability cultivation and 3-4 % decrease in spring barley over each 10 years. Corn cultivation conditions in the southern Steppe were deemed unsatisfactory, while those for spring barley remained satisfactory. Yield shortfalls due to the changes in air temperature and precipitation from 1981 to 2010 were 35-40 % for corn and 22-25 % for spring barley.Conclusions. The changes in precipitation and air temperature in Ukraine have significant implications for field crop productivity throughout the vegetation cycle. Decreases in precipitation levels during crop ripening stages and higher precipitation deficits during certain vegetation stages have resulted in reduced precipitation suitability and lower crop productivity. When combined with increased air temperature, these changes further contribute to decreased climate productivity and increased yield shortfalls for corn and spring barley. The most pronounced effects are observed in the Steppe region, particularly in the southern Steppe, where corn yield shortfalls due to air temperature and precipitation changes from 1981 to 2010 reached 35-40 % of the maximum potential yield under optimal climatic conditions, compared to 22-25 % for spring barley In contrast, the agroclimatic conditions for corn and spring barley cultivation in Polissia remained favorable throughout the observation period (1981-2010), regardless of changes in air temperature and precipitation. In the Forest-Steppe zone, conditions were favorable for barley cultivation and satisfactory for corn in the central and eastern areas. Abnormally high air temperatures coupled with precipitation deficits have resulted in higher yield shortfalls for cereals in significant areas of the country. The combination of increased air temperature and drier conditions underscores the diminishing potential of dryland farming in Ukraine, particularly in the Steppe region.																			2312-3370	2312-3389					2023	10	1					31	53		10.15407/agrisp10.01.031	http://dx.doi.org/10.15407/agrisp10.01.031													WOS:001046459400004
J	Yang, X; Wang, BR; An, SS				Yang, Xuan; Wang, Baorong; An, Shaoshan			Root derived C rather than root biomass contributes to the soil organic carbon sequestration in grassland soils with different fencing years	PLANT AND SOIL												Aims Belowground carbon (C) input is a key component of the global C cycle. However, how does fencing affect Belowground net primary production (BNPP) and the contribution of root derived C to belowground C input remains poorly studied. Methods In this study, the in-growth soil cores-C-13 method was used to quantify net root C input. Five different plant communities of different fencing years (1 year, 5 years, 10 years, 25 years, 30 years) in the Loess Plateau of China, characterized by herbs and shrubs were investigated. Results BNPP was increased with the increase of fencing years: 61.54 similar to 140.23 gC.m(-2).yr(-1). Root derived C in soil represented a considerable contribution to BNPP varying from 57 to 81 %, and the proportion of root derived C to BNPP was decreased with the fencing years. The contribution of root derived C to soil organic carbon (SOC) was 3 %similar to 5 % during one-year growth. Conclusions Our results underline the fact that fencing is an effective means to improve the BNPP and plant community. Root derived C rather than root biomass contributes to the SOC sequestration in grassland soils with different fencing years. Fencing increases the contribution of root derived C to SOC mainly by increasing root C content.

J	Liao, JJ; Dou, YX; An, SS				Liao, Jiaojiao; Dou, Yanxing; An, Shaoshan			Plant community productivity is associated with multiple ecological stoichiometry in restoration grasslands	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Ecological stoichiometry links the growth of living organisms at the organ level through the strict elemental ratio (carbon [C], nitrogen [N] as well as phosphorus [P]). And this is conducive to maintaining plant productivity in terrestrial ecosystems. Yet, the identification about the significance of multiple ecological stoichiometry (including leaves, roots, soil and microbial biomass) in shaping plant productivity remains unknown. Here, we evaluated the ecological stoichiometry contributions to plant productivity in restoration grasslands on the Loess Plateau (1-, 5-, 10-, 15-, 25-, 30-years restoration grasslands). We found that grassland restoration for 30 years enhanced plant community productivity by 67.34%, which showed the synchronous increase trend with C and N contents in leaves, roots, soil as well as microbial biomass. However, leaves, roots, soil and microbial biomass P contents displayed the opposite change trend with no significant difference in these restoration grasslands (p > 0.05). Microbial biomass C/N/P ratios exhibited thesignificant correlations with leaves, roots, soil C/N/P ratios, as well as plant community productivity (p < 0.01), indicating that stoichiometry of soil microbial biomass is greatly restricted, with the potential to influence plant community productivity. These findings emphasized the crucial role of microbial biomass stoichiometry as a primary regulator on plant community productivity, providing the important data to improve the parameterization of plant growth models in natural grassland of China.

Invasion reversal by front transitions and their implications for ecosystem management	CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS												Alien species often become invasive by triggering the growth of pathogens that exert a strong negative effect on the native species. Using an extended Lotka-Volterra plant competition model that includes pathogen dynamics with a strong Allee effect we identify a bistability range of counter-propagating fronts representing invasion and recovery dynamics. The fronts differ in the levels of the pathogen in the front zone; high, beyond the Allee threshold for the invasion front and low, below that threshold for the recovery front. Invasion reversal is then studied as induced transitions from invasion fronts to recovery fronts. The study suggests managing invasion by local manipulations in the front zone that increase the Allee threshold and thereby reverse the front from invasion to recovery. We demonstrate numerically direct and indirect manipulations of this kind.

This field experiment was conducted to assess the impact of soil and plant nitrogen N and P ratio on the growth and yield of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in alkaline calcareous soil. The study consisted of various levels of nitrogen (0, 40, 80, and 160 kg ha(-1) as urea) and phosphorus (0, 30, 60, and 90 kg P2O5 ha(-1) as diammonium phosphate), and was carried out in randomized complete block design (RCBD) with factorial arrangement having three replications. The result showed that the addition of 160 kg N ha(-1) significantly improved biological yield (10,052 kg ha(-1)), grain weight (3120 kg ha(-1)), chlorophyll content at tillering stage soil plant analysis development (SPAD) value (35.38), N uptake in straw (33.42 kg ha(-1)), and K uptake in straw (192 kg ha(-1)) compared to other N levels. In case of P, 90 kg P2O5 ha(-1) had resulted maximum biological yield (9852 kg ha(-1)), grain yield (3663 kg ha(-1)), chlorophyll content at tillering stage (SPAD value 34.36), P (6.68 mg kg(-1)) and K (171 kg ha(-1)) uptake in straw. The sole use of N and P have positively influenced the biological and grain yield but their interaction didn't response to biological yield. The present study reveals that SPAD value (chlorophyll meter) is the better choice for determining plant N and P concentrations to estimate the yield potential.					adnan, yousuf/HJP-2377-2023; Shahzad, Haroon/AAK-6521-2021; Fahad, Shah/GZM-2604-2022; Adnan, Muhammad/HSH-7590-2023; Aboelhana, Eldessoky/AGG-2645-2022; Adnan, Muhammad/AFB-8795-2022; Adnan, Muhammad/ABF-2904-2020; Ilahi, Haroon/AAF-4657-2022; Danish, Subhan/Q-1414-2018; Adnan, Muhammad/HDL-9249-2022; Ilahi, Haroon/AFJ-5174-2022; Fahad, Shah/J-7265-2019	Shahzad, Haroon/0000-0001-9395-4820; Aboelhana, Eldessoky/0000-0001-8752-3450; Adnan, Muhammad/0000-0001-9081-2229; Adnan, Muhammad/0000-0002-7582-4675; Ilahi, Haroon/0000-0003-0111-4352; Danish, Subhan/0000-0002-6182-6207; Ilahi, Haroon/0000-0003-0111-4352; Fahad, Shah/0000-0002-7525-0296; Ahmad, Ishaq Mian/0000-0003-4702-3325; Khan, Shadman/0000-0002-2317-4025														2071-1050				FEB	2021	13	4							2253	10.3390/su13042253	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13042253													WOS:000624834700001

Intercepted radiation and radiation-use efficiency in sunflower crops grown at conventional and wide inter-row spacings: Measurements and modeled estimates of intercepted radiation	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												The underlying eco-physiological principle behind row spacing choice in many field crops is that early and complete ground cover will maximize yield via greater crop photosynthesis during the critical period for grain number determination in environments with no major water limitations. Recently this principle has been put in doubt: wide row-spacing (1.40 m instead of 0.7 m) did not reduce oil or biomass yield in sunflower at plant densities of between 2 and 7 pl m(-2), in spite of incomplete ground cover at the wider row spacing. Here, we report the effect of two row spacings (0.7 and 1.4 m), in sunflower crops of equal plant density, on interception of radiation, radiation use efficiency (RUE), crop biomass and oil yields in three experiments. Two approaches were used to estimate interception of radiation by the crops: i) periodic diurnal measurements during the crop cycle of interception in the inter-row space and on the sides of the hedgerows; and ii) the use of a olive hedgerow model, adapted to sunflower, to estimate radiation intercepted by the two crop arrays. Biomass at anthesis, at physiological maturity, and oil yield in crops grown in the two row-spacings did not differ. The results show that the increased RUE of the 1.4-m spaced crops in pre-anthesis phase was able to compensate for the delay of these crops in achieving close to full interception of irradiance. The daily patterns of irradiance incident on the hedgerow faces, especially the sunlit face, in the pre-anthesis phase and in the early and late hours of the day, were strongly affected by row-spacing. A more favorable irradiance in these periods of the day in the mid- and upper portions of the sunlit face of the 1.4-m spaced hedgerows may have contributed to the greater RUE values of these crops in the pre anthesis phase. The hedgerow model provided descriptions of the seasonal dynamics of intercepted radiation that were fully consistent with measured values for both row spacings.																			0378-4290	1872-6852				FEB 1	2020	246								107684	10.1016/j.fcr.2019.107684	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2019.107684													WOS:000509631600016

Assessment of potassium status in soils under different land use systems of Assam	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES												The knowledge on contribution of potassium (K) from different pools become pertinent for evaluating soil fertility status and providing better interpretation in near future. The present study aims to assess the soil K pools under major land use systems of Assam, viz. mulberry, sugarcane, tea and rice-mustard under three depths (0-15, 15-30 and 30-60 cm) and categories them, based on the content of exchangeable K (Exch-K) and non-exchangeable K (NEK). In 0-15 cm soil depth, Exch-K content was highest in the rice-mustard land use system (49.7 mg/kg) whereas, NEK content were highest in the mulberry land use system (1351 mg/kg). Both Exch-K and NEK content were found to be highest under mulberry system at 15-30 and 30-60 cm depth. Mulberry and rice-mustard land use systems had higher amounts of NEK but lower in available K, thereby, need maintenance dose of K. The NEK pools were included along with Exch-K in categorising soils into nine groups for evolving better strategies to manage soil K fertility. Results revealed that most of the soils were in category with low Exch-K and NEK content. Irrespective of depths, soils from nine sites were low in both Exch-K and NEK. The third category soils with low Exch-K and high NEK had the second highest number of soils in all the depths.Thus, soils having low levels of both Exch-K and NEK, the K must be applied immediately to sustain crop productivity under different land use systems.

Capturing the Scale Dependency of Erosion-Induced Variation in CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions on Terraced Slopes	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Net soil CO2 emissions are not independent of topography but tend to decline with increasing slope gradients. Such decline has been attributed to increased runoff and greater soil loss on steep slopes, leaving the soil less habitable for microorganisms. However, the specific variations of slope gradients and thus the associated soil properties relevant for CO2 emissions, especially from terraced slopes, are often disguised by the coarse resolution of digital terrain models (DTMs) based on commonly available open-source data. Such misrepresentation of the relationship between topography and soil CO2 emissions carries the risk of a wrong assessment of soil-atmosphere interaction. By applying a slope dependent soil CO2 emission model developed from erosion plots to nearby sloping and partially terraced cropland using two DTMs of different spatial resolutions, this study tested the significance of these resolution-induced errors on CO2 emission estimates. The results show that the coarser-resolution Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) underestimated CO2-C emission by 27% compared to the higher-resolution DTM derived from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) imagery. Such difference can be mostly attributed to a better representation of the proportion of flat slopes in the high-resolution DTM. Although the observations from erosion plots cannot be directly extrapolated to a larger scale, the 27% underestimation using the coarser-resolution SRTM DTM emphasizes that it is essential to represent microreliefs and their impact on runoff and erosion-induced soil heterogeneity at an appropriate scale. The widespread impact of topography on erosion and deposition on cropland, and the associated slope-dependent heterogeneity of soil properties, may lead to even greater differences than those observed in this study. The greatly improved estimation on CO2 emissions by the UAV-derived DTM also demonstrates that UAVs have a great potential to fill the gap between conventional field investigations and commonly applied coarse-resolution remote sensing when assessing the impact of soil erosion on global soil-atmosphere interaction.																				2296-665X				JUN 18	2021	9								688286	10.3389/fenvs.2021.688286	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.688286													WOS:000668723900001

In the present study, we assessed the intrinsic high viral growth capability as a potential viral factor that may influence their susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs using an in vitro model. Phytohemagglutinin-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (1.5 x 10(6) cells) were infected with HIV isolates (10(6) copies/mL). The culture was carried out at different concentrations (0.001-20 mu M) of 13 synthetic antiretroviral compounds (six nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, four integrase inhibitors, and two protease inhibitors), and HIV production was assessed using HIV-RNA copies in culture. The 90% inhibitory concentration (IC90) and pharmacokinetics of an antiretroviral agent were used as parameters to determine the reduced antiretroviral drug susceptibility of HIV isolates with high growth capability to synthetic antiretroviral compounds. The high growth capability of HIV isolates without any known drug resistance-related mutation affected their susceptibility to tenofovir (IC90 = 2.05 +/- 0.40 mu M), lamivudine (IC90 = 6.83 +/- 3.96 mu M), emtricitabine (IC90 = 0.68 +/- 0.37 mu M), and efavirenz (IC90 = 3.65 +/- 0.77 mu M). These antiretroviral drugs showed IC90 values close to or above the maximum plasma concentration against HIV isolates with high growth capability without any known drug resistance-related mutation. Our results may contribute to the development of effective strategies to tailor and individualize antiretroviral therapy in patients harboring HIV isolates with high growth capability.

A public goods referendum has proven to be incentive compatible for the more popular contingent valuation method. For attribute based choices, the choice experimental method values goods and services by attribute levels producing marginal values for the economic good. A referendum procedure has been proposed for this attribute based method but it is unclear how its use impacts participant choices. This research develops a controlled laboratory experiment eliciting individual and group responses for two non-market public goods using a referendum format for attribute based choice experiments. Results of the experiments find that a majority referendum rule induces individuals to form responses based upon group perceptions which may lead to non-truthful preference revelation.

J	Li, SL; Xiao, B				Li, Shenglong; Xiao, Bo			Cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts increase evaporation by regulating surface soil moisture and temperature on the northern Loess Plateau, China	CATENA												Soil evaporation is a three-stage process and plays a vital role in soil physical, chemical, and biological processes, as well as global climate change. As an important living skin, biocrusts strongly influence most soil properties and support fundamental ecosystem functions. Although there are many studies concerning biocrust effects on surface soil hydrological processes, it still remains unclear how biocrusts impact soil evaporation and their potential effects on the water budget in drylands. In this study, we selected aeolian sandy soil (bare soil) and three types of biocrusts, specifically cyanobacteria (cyano), cyanobacteria and moss mixed crusts (cyano-moss), and moss crusts (moss), on the northern Chinese Loess Plateau. By utilizing weighing micro-lysimeters in simulated and similar to 4 months in-situ field evaporation experiments, we investigated all evaporation stages containing stages I-II and III, as well as the soil evaporation rate (E) of all treatments. The soil moisture (theta) and temperature (T) at 2 cm and 10 cm depths were also measured in field. Our results showed that biocrust types strongly influenced E in the ranked order of moss > cyano-moss > cyano > bare soil. The cumulative evaporation amount (E-c) of all types of biocrusts was significantly higher than that of bare soil in simulated experiments. Particularly, moss increased Ec by 15.7% compared with bare soil. The results of in-situ field measurements illustrated that the E of cyano, cyano-moss, and moss was increased by 42.4%, 55.5%, and 46.9%, respectively, compared with the bare soil, and these increasing effects became more pronounced after rainfall events. Additionally, all types of biocrusts markedly increased theta and decreased T at 0-10 cm depth of soil, but cyano and cyano-moss increased T (by up to 5.7 degrees C) at 2 cm depth during the non-rainfall periods. The increasing effects of biocrusts on E were reasonably attributed to their higher contents of fine particles and organic matter, as well as their higher field capacity in contrast to bare soil. All these regulations of biocrusts on soil properties further reshaped soil water and temperature regimes and finally changed soil evaporation. In conclusion, biocrusts may greatly intensify surface soil water loss due to their higher E. However, their greater theta and lower T in comparison to bare soil may partially offset these negative effects in return, and they may have feedback impacts on surface soil water and heat balances in drylands.

In this study, peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) seeds were inoculated with AMF to investigate its salinity stress alleviation effects using the pot-grown and 2-year field experiments. Seeds from two peanut cultivars (HY22 and HY25) were inoculated with AMF Rhizophagus irregularis SA and Funneliformis mosseae BEG95 (1:1), and the physiological and transcriptional responses were compared between the AMF-inoculated and non-inoculated peanut plants. Under the salinity stress, compared with the control samples, the AMF-inoculated plants showed higher net photosynthetic rate, leaf relative water content (RWC), plant height, osmolyte accumulation, but lower leaf relative electrolyte conductivity (REC). Also, the malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration was reduced while the antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), guaiacol peroxidase (G-POD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) were activated. Furthermore, transcriptome data revealed that AMF potentially alleviates salt stress by regulating redox processes, cell wall assembly, cell growth, and other similar processes. In the 2-year field experiment, AMF-inoculated peanut seeds of HY22 and HY25 were cultivated in both non-saline and saline soils. Under salinity conditions, AMF inoculation induced the total protein concentration by 11.11 and 2.32% in kernels and further increased the peanut pod yield by 21.83 and 21.89% in HY22 and HY25, respectively. In non-saline soil too, AMF increased the peanut pod yield by 11.47 and 23.98% in HY22 and HY25, respectively. Taken together, these results strongly demonstrate that the combination of AMF Rhizophagus irregularis SA and Funneliformis mosseae BEG95 (1:1) can alleviate salinity stress in peanuts by improving plant growth, photosystem, and antioxidant system. Additionally, it increases the peanut pod yield under both normal and salinity conditions.

Focusing on a landscape in central Burkina Faso dominated by Vitellaria paradoxa and Parkia biglobosa, this paper examines how tree cover influences crop yield at landscape scale using satellite data and spatial statistics. Our analysis is based on data from 2017 to 2018 with differences in rainfall to assess the stability in identified relationships. Our findings showed that tree canopy cover and tree density inside the fields tended to decrease crop yield because of competition, but also that these variables when considering the surrounding landscape exerted an opposite effect because of their buffering effects. The explanatory variables representing soil properties did have limited effects on crop yield in this study. These patterns were consistent during the two years of monitoring. Overall, our results suggest that farmers in this area might manage the tree cover in a way that optimizes sustainable yields as canopy cover and tree density in most parklands is below the limits identified here where competition outweight the facilitative effects.						/0000-0003-2361-5465													0140-1963	1095-922X				NOV	2023	218								105051	10.1016/j.jaridenv.2023.105051	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2023.105051		AUG 2023											WOS:001063540600001

In this study, the effects of a fungus, Piriformospora indica, on growth and salt resistance in gerbera (Gerbera jamesonii L.) seedlings were investigated. After co-cultivation with P. indica, the gerbera roots were colonized by the mature chlamydospores of P. indica. A large increase in plant biomass and enhanced photosynthesis were observed in the P. indica-colonized seedlings. Moreover, these seedlings also exhibited a strong tolerance to salt stress after the colonization. The wilting symptoms, the impairments in chlorophyll, carotenoids, and photosynthesis, and anthocyanin accumulation, that can be caused by salt stress, were alleviated in the P. indica-colonized plants. The malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide levels were lower in P. indica-colonized plants than in non-colonized plants under salt treatment, whereas both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants were not increased by P. indica colonization. Differential expressions of sodium transporter genes and aquaporin genes were found in gerbera plants after P. indica colonization. The P. indica colonization positively regulated the transcription level of genes involved in ionic homeostasis, such as NHX2 and SOS1, while most aquaporin genes were not induced in P. indica-colonized gerbera seedlings exposed to salt stress, except for NIP6;1 gene. These results demonstrate a strategy through plant-microbe interaction to promote Gerbera jamesonii performance under salt stress.					li, jiaxin/JNT-5073-2023	Kuo, Yun-Wei/0000-0003-3115-9850													0721-7595	1435-8107				MAY	2022	41	3					1219	1228		10.1007/s00344-021-10385-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-021-10385-4		APR 2021											WOS:000645884100001

In addition, the study aimed at identifying Mccp antigens using species specific primer of PCR. A multistage random sampling was implemented to select districts, pastoral associations (villages), and households. A total of 890 serum samples of small ruminants that had not been vaccinated (goats n=789 and sheep n=101) were collected and screened for the presence of antibodies against Mycoplasma capricolum subspecies capripneumoniae using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Lung tissues and pleural fluid samples were collected from 3 sero-positive and clinically suspected goats for isolation of Mycoplasma capricolum subspecies capripneumoniae. Serology showed that overall 31.2% (246/789) of goats and 12.9% (13/101) of sheep were positive with statistically significant differences between districts (p=0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that goats from Moyale and Yabello districts had higher odds of being positive than goats from Elwoya district with odd ratios of 2.05 and 1.61, respectively. Age of goats was also significantly associated with sero-positivity (OR=1.47; CI 95% 1.2-1.8). Mycoplasma capricolum subspecies capripneumoniae was identified in 6 (75%) of the tissue samples using species-specific primer of PCR. Besides improving the understanding of the epidemiology of CCPP in the selected districts and demonstrating its wide distribution, the study highly also provides evidence of the possible role of sheep in the maintenance of the disease.

J	Wang, CG; Ma, JY; Wang, YX; Li, ZB; Ma, B				Wang, Chenguang; Ma, Jianye; Wang, Yangxiu; Li, Zhanbin; Ma, Bo			The influence of wheat straw mulching and straw length on infiltration, runoff and soil loss	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Straw mulching is a typical soil and water conservation measure for slope farms, and it plays an important role in preventing soil erosion. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of the length and coverage of wheat straw on infiltration, runoff and soil loss. In this study, an indoor simulated rainfall experiment was used to study the characteristics of infiltration, runoff and sediment yield under different straw lengths and coverage when the rainfall intensity was 90 mm h(-1). The results show that the straw mulch contributes more to the effect of infiltration, runoff and sediment yield than straw length. Increasing the straw coverage increases the average infiltration rate and reduces the cumulative runoff and sediment yield. An increase in straw length, however, reduces the average infiltration rate of the slope and increases the cumulative runoff and sediment yield. The benefits of straw mulch in increasing average infiltration and reducing runoff and sediment yield are consistent with the law of diminishing marginal returns. The marginal benefit of straw is optimal when the straw cover is 3.5 t center dot hm(-2). The sum of straw mulch and length multiplied by cover divided by length has a power function relationship with slope infiltration, while runoff and sediment yield have a power function relationship with its reciprocal. The average infiltration rate of the slope surface is significantly linearly related to the cumulative sediment yield. The simulation accuracy of the Horton model is higher than that of the Kostiakov model. In this study, when the straw length was 3-5 cm and the mulch rate was 4.5 t center dot hm(-2), the average slope infiltration was highest, and the runoff and sediment yield were lowest. Wheat straw surface mulch, when applied as an effective measure for controlling soil erosion and maintaining soil and water resources on sloped fields, can effectively increase infiltration and reduce runoff and sediment yield; wheat mulch is thus critical for the sustainable development of agriculture and ecology on sloping land.																			0885-6087	1099-1085				APR	2022	36	4							e14561	10.1002/hyp.14561	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14561													WOS:000787205800001

Allan			Energy requirements, length of digestive tract compartments and body mass in six gerbilline rodents of the Negev Desert	ZOOLOGY												Energy requirements of an animal are size dependent and, in this study, the average daily metabolic rate (ADMR) of six Negev Desert gerbilline rodents, ranging in body mass (m(b)) from 10 g to over 200 g, scaled to m(b)(0.57). Although gerbilline rodents are considered 'granivores', these rodents consume substantial amounts of green vegetation and the largest gerbil is a strict herbivore. We predicted that the lengths of the compartments of the digestive tract would scale allometrically to mb(0.33) and that ADMR would scale allometrically to the lengths of the compartments to the exponent of 1.73. Using log-transformed data, the length of the colon scaled to m(b)(0.50) = 0.74; p = 0.02), of the caecum to m(b)(0.45) = 0.80; p = 0.01) and of the small intestine to m(b)(0.30) = 0.59; p < 0.05). Therefore, the exponents for the colon and caecum were higher than predicted and were close to the exponent for ADMR generated for the rodents. The absolute lengths of the colon (r(adj)(2) = 0.68; p = 0.03; slope = 0.99) and of the caecum (r(adj)(2) = 0.79; p = 0.01; slope = 1.19) were related significantly to ADMR, but of the small intestine was not (r(adj)(2) = 0.04; p = 0.33; slope = 0.85). The exponents implied that the relationships were isometric and not allometric as predicted and that the rates of increase of the lengths of the intestine compartments were at the same rate as the increase in ADMR. The lengths of the colon and caecum were highly correlated between each other (r(adj)(2 )= 0.98; p < 0.001; slope = 1.12) and explained most of the variation in ADMR. Green vegetation could be a nutritional bottleneck for rodents as it is bulky and, consequently, limits the dietary intake, and fermentation occurs in the caecum and colon, whereas seeds, which are compact and are digested in the small intestine, would limit intake to a much lesser degree. However, when the effect of body mass was eliminated by using residuals of the variables on body mass, only the length of the small intestine was significant (r(adj)(2) = 0.86; p < 0.005; slope = -1.33) and was related negatively to ADMR. Therefore, when effects of body size were removed, most of the variation in ADMR was explained by the length of the small intestine and implied that the length of the small intestine increased with a decrease in ADMR. A higher energy expenditure was related to a shorter small intestine and, therefore, by implication, a higher concentration of metabolizable energy yield of the diet. We also questioned whether there are differences in the morphology of the digestive tract due to differences in dietary consumption. The digestive tracts of the gerbils were not diverse and could be characterized as structurally homogenous. All the gerbils had a uni-locular, hemiglandular stomach and the differences in the digestive tract among species did not seem to be of functional importance, but rather were related to the taxon. However, some important morpho-functional characteristics of the digestive tract emerged that apply to the whole group.

J	Assefa, A; Lemma, M				Assefa, Ayalew; Lemma, Meressa			Ecological niche modeling for stingless bees (genus Melipona) in Waghemira and North Wollo zones of Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia	SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN												Ethiopia has excellent potential for the existence of different stingless bee species. However, these species are wild and are facing extinction danger due to destructive harvesting and environmental degradations. To support the domestication and protection of these species, we developed a habitat suitability model for Waghemira and Lasta area (North Wollo Zone). A survey of stingless bees was carried out in Sekota, Dehana, Ziquala, Abergelle, Sehala seyemt, Tsagbji and Gazgibla from the Waghemira zone; and Gidan, Lalibela and Bugna from North Wollo zone (Lasta area) between 2016 and 2017. Environmental variables that are known to determine the site selection habit of stingless bees were used to develop the model. Multicollinearity between environmental variables was checked and maximum entropy model was used with maxent software. The accuracy of the model was assessed with the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and was found to be 0.91. Variables like Water vapor pressure (35%), precipitation seasonality (25.1%), elevation (12.3%), temperature annual range (11.7%), wind speed (7.4%) contributed the highest share in the model. The predicted suitable areas are located in mid and higher altitudes of the Waghemira and North Wollo zone (Lasta area). Sekota district was very suitable. Besides, Lalibela, Gazgibla, Bugna, and Dehana were also reasonably suitable districts for stingless bees. However, the lowlands of the Waghemira zone, i.e., districts of Abergele, Ziquala and Sehala Seyemt, were found unsuitable for stingless bees. This study can be used as a basis for future intervention activities related to bee collection, domestication and commercialization in the study area and similar agroecology in Ethiopia.(c) 2022 The Authors.

This sector faces many abiotic and biotic constraints that could threat its sustainability. Thus, the heated greenhouses encounter destructive pests such as the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) and the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae (Koch) (Acari: Tetranychidae). Results This study aimed to assess the effect of the entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) Beauveria bassiana (strain ATCC and strain R444) and Lecanicillium muscarium strain Ve6 on simultaneous existence of T. urticae and B. tabaci in the host plants. The EPF had a significant effect on eggs and larvae of B. tabaci and on eggs and mobile forms of T. urticae in particular. The use of B. bassiana ATCC, B. bassiana R444 and L. muscarium strains Ve6 showed significant efficacies against B. tabaci larvae and eggs compared to untreated control. Indeed, the reduction percent of B. tabaci eggs varied between 42.65 and 58.52%. Thus, the efficacy against the number of B. tabaci larvae was in order to 65.04, 60.26 and 55.52% of B. bassiana strain ATCC, B. bassiana strain R444 and L. muscarium strain Ve6, respectively. In addition, these EPF were very effective on T. urticae eggs with a percentage reduction greater than 92.86%, whereas the percentage reduction in the T. urticae mobile forms varied between 95.11 and 98.52%. Conclusions Use of EPF will be an imperative to develop directed interventions at the integrated management of these two pests in protected and geothermal crops.

This study investigated the possible implications of projected climate change on the phenology, effective rainfall (P-eff), crop (CWR) and irrigation water requirements (IWR) of maize in eight locations in India. CWR, P-eff and IWR were estimated for seven crop stages viz., emergence, 5th leaf stage, tasseling, silking, milking, dough and maturity during the baseline (1980-2009) and near-century (2022-39) using climate data derived from a subset of 29 general circulation models. The results indicated that mean seasonal maximum temperature, minimum temperature and rainfall were projected to increase in all the locations. Hence, the total crop duration (3-7 days), CWR (8-69 mm) and IWR (1-54 mm) were projected to decrease. The study could identify the specific stages in which the greatest reduction in crop duration, CWR and IWR would occur. Such information will be of immense help to farmers and varietal improvement programs in the study regions in the near future.

In this study, eight alfalfa plots with and without ground canopy and two bare soil plots (CK) were used to investigate the effect of alfalfa growth on the regulation of runoff and sediment during one growing season (seedling stage, S1; budding stage, S2; flowering stage, S3; podding stage, S4). The experiments involved four slope gradients of 8.6%, 17.6%, 26.8%, and 36.4% and one rainfall intensity of 90 mm h(-1). The time to runoff initiation (TR), runoff volume (RV), and sediment yield (SY) were recorded, and runoff reduction benefits (RRBs) and sediment reduction benefits (SRBs) were calculated. The results have shown that TR was delayed with the growth of alfalfa and advanced with an increasing slope gradient. From S1 to S4, compared with CK, alfalfa grassland reduced the runoff by 10.36% to 85.80% and the sediment by 15.34% to 94.48%. The root systems of alfalfa reduced the runoff by 1.29% to 34.86% and the sediment by 0.87% to 49.97%. RV and SY decreased exponentially with aboveground biomass and root density during the growing season. The SRBs were greater than the RRBs, and the contribution of stem leaves for SRBs and RRBs was higher than that for roots under the same growing seasons and slope gradient. This study deepens our understanding of herbaceous plants in regulating runoff and sediment at different growth stages and clarifies the contribution of vegetation components to soil and water loss control.																			1085-3278	1099-145X				2023 MAY 11	2023										10.1002/ldr.4731	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4731		MAY 2023											WOS:000985139600001

Meanwhile, these interparticle forces are strongly influenced by specific ion effects. In this study, we applied three monovalent cations (Li+, Na+, and K+) with various concentrations to investigate the influence of specific ion effects on aggregate stability and splash erosion via pipette and rainfall simulation methods. The specific ion effects on soil interparticle forces were quantitatively evaluated by introducing cationic non-classical polarization. The results showed that aggregate stability and splash erosion had strong ion specificity. Aggregate breaking strength and splash erosion rate at the same salt concentration followed the sequence as Li+ > Na+ > K+. With decreasing salt concentration, the difference in aggregate breaking strength or splash erosion rate between different cation systems increased initially (1-10 -2 mol L-1) and later was nearly invariable (10(-2)-10(-4) mol L-1). The experimental results were well quantitatively explained by soil interparticle forces considering cationic non-classical polarization. Furthermore, both aggregate breaking strength and splash erosion rate of three cations revealed a strong positive linear relation with net force subjected to cationic non-classical polarization (R-2 = 0.81, R-2 = 0.81). These results demonstrated that different non-classical polarization of cations resulted in different soil interparticle forces, and thus led to differences in aggregate stability and splash erosion. Our study provides valuable information to deeply understand the mechanisms of rainfall splash erosion.

Therefore, this study conducted a questionnaire survey of 455 interviewees in Ansai County on the Loess Plateau and combined the structural equation model (SEM) to explore the characteristics and influencing factors of public perceptions of CESs. Moreover, we also calculated landscape importance to quantify the impact of landscape features on CESs. The results showed that ecological restoration increased the overall public perceptions of CESs. Regarding the different types of CESs, the public most strongly perceived esthetic services but had the lowest perception of cultural heritage after ecological restoration. Regarding demographic characteristics, gender and age were the most important factors affecting public perceptions. Men were more likely to perceive CESs than women, while older interviewees had higher perceptions of the value of physical and mental health services, education and science than young interviewees. In addition, forestlands were perceived as playing more important roles than other landscape types in providing CESs. This study demonstrates that ecological restoration will improve public perceptions of CESs. Managers should incorporate public perceptions of CESs into the formulation of ecological management policies.

Phenological development of subterranean clover<i> (Trifolium</i><i> subterraneum</i> L.) in New Zealand in response to different climate change scenarios	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												Climate predictions for New Zealand for the coming decades suggest rising temperatures (+0.7-3 degrees C), increased diurnal temperature and variable precipitation patterns that differ around the country and with seasons. The most common pattern of annual precipitation indicates the largest increases in the west of the South Island and the largest decreases in the east of the North Island and coastal Marlborough. The phenophases of subterranean clover were estimated and quantified using a thermal time-based model under different climate scenarios based on greenhouse gases and aerosol pathways over the 21st century, known as the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), at two periods (mid and end of the century). The estimated flowering (R3) and post-flowering (R6-R11) date change showed a consistent trend across all districts. The largest date advances (& GE; 5 days) were predicted for the three current latest flowering districts (Mackenzie, Queenstown and Central Otago). A reduction of the plant's life cycle, for both 'Early' and 'Late' maturity cultivars may have undesired consequences for forage yield so genetic material with later flowering dates may be useful. Adaptation strategies to mitigate the future warming effects include using 'Late' flowering cultivars and greater use of supplementary feed through summer dry conditions.

PLANTS-BASEL												The U-box E3 (PUB) family genes encode the E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme, which determines substrate specific recognition during protein ubiquitination. They are widespread in plants and are critical for plant growth, development, and response to external stresses. However, there are few studies on the functional characteristic of PUB gene family in the important staple crop, maize (Zea mays L.). In this study, the PUB gene in maize was aimed to identify and classify through whole-genome screening. Phylogenetic tree, gene structure, conserved motif, chromosome location, gene duplication (GD), synteny, and cis-acting regulatory element of PUB member were analyzed. The expression profiles of ZmPUB gene family in maize during development and under abiotic stress and hormones treatment were analyzed by the RNA-seq data. A total of 79 PUB genes were identified in maize genome, and they were stratified into seven categories. There were 25 pairs of segmental duplications (SD) and 1 pair of tandem duplication (TD) identified in the maize PUB gene family. A close relationship was observed between the monocot plant maize and rice in PUB gene family. There were 94 kinds of cis-acting elements identified in the maize PUB gene family, which included 46 bioticand abiotic-responsive elements, 19 hormone-responsive elements, 13 metabolic and growth-related elements. The expression profiles of maize PUB gene family showed characteristics of tissue specificity and response to abiotic stress and hormones treatment. These results provided an extensive overview of the maize PUB gene family.

Can adoption of climate resilient management practices achieve carbon neutrality in traditional green revolution states of Punjab and Haryana?	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Decreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and enhancing soil carbon (C) sequestration in cropland are necessary to achieve carbon neutrality at national scale. The major objective of this study is to quantify the GHG mitigation potential of adopted climate resilient (CR) practices in CR villages using Ex-ACT tool developed by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Intensively cultivated area of Punjab and Haryana was selected for carrying out this study. In both the states, villages were selected by considering the climate for past 30 years. In the selected villages, a set of CR practices were implemented in annuals, perennials, irrigated rice, fertilizer use, land use change and livestock and quantified the GHG mitigation potential in these villages for next twenty years. The tool predicted that the CR practices adopted were successful in enhancing the overall sink (carbon balance) in all the study villages. The villages of Punjab had recorded higher mitigation potential as compared to the villages of Haryana. The overall sink potential in these villages ranged from -354 to -38309 Mg CO2-eq. The change in sink potential varied from 3.16 to 112% with lowest in Radauri and highest in Badhauchhi kalan village. The sink potential got doubled in Badhauchhi kalan village due to stopping rice straw burning and increase in area under perennials by 25%. The source potential varied from 6.33 to -7.44% across the study villages. Even with the implementation of NICRA, there was increase in source by 5.58 and 6.33% in Killi Nihal Singh Wala and Radauri due to irrigated rice, land use change and livestock. Majorly, rice straw burning was seen in most of the study villages, yet, with proper residue management and adoption of CR practices (mainly intermittent flooding) in rice cultivation resulted in emissions reduction up to 5-26% with enhanced productivity up to 15-18%, which can be considered for scaling up. Fertilizer management reduced the emissions by average of 13% across the study villages. Farm gate emission intensity per ton of milk and rice recorded highest emission intensity compared to annuals and perennials suggesting strict implementation of CR practices in rice cultivation and livestock sector. Implementation and scaling up of CR practices could potentially reduce the emissions and make the village C negative in intensive rice-wheat production system.

Spatial rice decision support system for effective rice crop management	CURRENT SCIENCE												Rice, a widely grown crop all over the world provides food security to millions of people. The average productivity of rice in India is still low due to diversified environments under which it is being cultivated. Prediction and assessment of rice yields needs simplified precision models. A spatial rice decision support system (SRDSS) was designed by integrating ClimGen climate model and Oryza2000 crop model with soil and weather layers. This DSS facilitates input model parameters and geo-referenced maps to predict rice yield at polygon/pixel level. SRDSS is useful to researchers and planners not only in estimating rice yield but also to estimate optimum crop sowing dates and management practices to achieve target yield for the selected location. Further, SRDSS will be integrated with weather sensors to generate real time advisories to farmers at each level of decision making and to plan and achieve the targets of doubling the farmer's income by 2022.																			0011-3891					FEB 10	2019	116	3					412	421		10.18520/cs/v116/i3/412-421	http://dx.doi.org/10.18520/cs/v116/i3/412-421													WOS:000457871900023

Nitrogen enrichment weakens the stability of the ecosystem through decreased biodiversity. Mowing is a viable management tool for the maintenance of diversity in grasslands. However, it is unclear how plant diversity affects soil C and N storage in mowing (or phosphorus) under N enrichment in the semi-arid alpine steppe. In the present study, a 3-year trial has investigated the effects of nitrogen, mowing (or phosphorus), and their interactions on plant diversity and soil C and N storage in a semi-arid alpine steppe in Qilian mountains, northern China. We found that aboveground biomass (AGB) was significantly increased in N (nitrogen added alone) and NP (both nitrogen and phosphorus added), significantly decreased in M (mowing) across the three years (2019-2021) (P < 0.05), and significantly increased by 21.4% in the third year in MN (nitrogen added at the time of mowing). Plant diversity was significantly decreased in N and NP, but had no significant effect under M, MN, and P across the three years. We found that SOC stock was significantly decreased by 13% in the 0-10 cm soil layer in N, while increased by 6% at the 10-20 cm soil layer in MN. In contrast, NP had no significant effect on SOC stock and TN stock, while both NO3-N and AP significantly increased. M increased the relative biomass of sedge and forb, while N increased the relative biomass of grass and decreased the relative biomass of forb. Forb is positively correlated with C storage and negatively correlated with N storage, while the grass is the opposite. Therefore, the results indicated that mowing modulated the effects of N addition on diversity loss and carbon stock loss. In contrast, phosphorus is ineffective for the negative effect of nitrogen on grassland species diversity.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				OCT	2022	217								106458	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106458	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106458													WOS:000822981200005

Six typical herbaceous plants that commonly appear during vegetation succession on the Loess Plateau were selected to detect the effects of plant root traits on the soil detachment at a species level. In total, 180 undisturbed soil samples were collected, and their soil detachment capacities were tested by overland flow by six specific combinations of slope (3) and flow discharge (4). Soil detachment capacity was estimated effectively using shear stress, bulk density, and root surface area density [R-2 = 0.78; Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) = 0.63]. The results showed that mean values of soil detachment capacity were ranged from 0.09 to 1.17 kg m(-2) s(-1). Pioneer species of Artemisia capillaris and Leymus secalinus had a high soil detachment capacity and were 6.32-12.57 times greater than that of late succession species. The mean soil detachment ca-pacity of plant with tap root system (Artemisia argyi, A. capillaris, and A. vestita) was 1.23 times greater than that of other plants with fibrous root systems (Bothriochloa ischcemum, L. secalinus, and Stipa bungeana). Soil detachment capacity decreased with soil bulk density as a power function (p < 0.01) and decreased with root traits of root length density, root surface area density, root area ratio, and root mass density as exponential functions (p < 0.01). Thus the effects of plant roots on soil erosion differed among herbaceous species were well reflected by the root surface area density.(c) 2022 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Abbas, F; Lin, F; Zhu, ZL; An, SS				Abbas, Fakher; Lin, Fang; Zhu, Zhaolong; An, Shaoshan			A Novel Index (RI) to Evaluate the Relative Stability of Soils Using Ultrasonic Agitation	SUSTAINABILITY												As soil stability is a complex phenomenon, various methods and indexes were introduced to assess the strength of soils. Because of the limitations of different stability methods and indexes (including wet sieving-based), we aimed to presents a relative stability index (RI) that was based on the estimated components of the soil overall disruptive characteristic curve (SODC): (1) soil disruption constant (K-i, that is based upon dispersion energy of soils); (2) resulting change in mean weight diameter (Delta MWD). To evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of RI as well as to compare it with classical soil stability indexes of mean weight diameter (MWD) and geometric mean diameter (GMD). Ultrasonic agitation (UA) along with a wet sieving method (followed by dry sieving) was applied against four different soils named on the basis of sample location, Qingling soil (QL), Guanzhong soil (GZ), Ansai soil (AS), and Jingbian soil (JB). To evaluate the relative strength of soils at different applied energies (increase in sonication duration usually resulted in increased input energy and temperature of soil-water suspension), soils were subjected to six sonication durations (0, 30, 60, 120, 210, and 300 s) with a fixed (and exact) initial amplitude and temperature. Output energy was calculated based on the amplitude and temperature of the suspension, vessel, and system. The most abrupt and maximum disruption of soil aggregates was observed at a dispersion energy level of 0-200 J g(-1). The MWD value of surface and subsurface ranged between 0.58 to 0.15 mm and 0.37 to 0.17 mm, respectively, while GMD was ranged from 0.14 to 0.33 mm overall. The results for MWD and GMD showed a similar trend. MWD and GMD showed more strong associations with physicochemical characteristics of soil than RI. A non-significant correlation was found between RI and MWD/GMD. Contrary to MWD and GMD, RI was significantly positively correlated with sand content; this finding indicated the influential role of sand in assessing the soil's relative strength. The results indicated that JB soil possessed the least MWD and GMD but proved to be relatively stable because of having the highest RI value.

Based on this knowledge, we established a practical and reliable method for creating new peanut varieties with high oil content using in vitro mutagenesis and directional OP-based selection. Using embryonic leaflets of peanut variety Huayu 20 as explants, pingyangmycin (PYM) as the mutagen, and hydroxyproline (HYP) as the OP regulator, we developed 15 HYP-tolerant regenerated plants. For each regenerated plant, we selected offspring with oil content>55% (relative to 49.5% for Huayu 20). We developed and released three new peanut varieties with high yield and high oil content from the offspring of the HYP-tolerant regenerated plants. The three new varieties were named as Yuhua 4, Yuhua 9 and Yuhua 14 and their oil contents were 57.7, 61.1 and 59.3%, respectively. The results indicate that in vitro mutagenesis with PYM followed by directed screening with HYP is a useful approach for breeding peanut varieties with high oil contents.																			2095-3119					DEC	2020	19	12					2974	2982		10.1016/S2095-3119(20)63182-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(20)63182-3													WOS:000594501900012

However, currently, the processes of soil splash detachment and transport under different soil internal forces are still not fully understood. Thus, to determine the effects of soil internal forces on the splash transport process, two soils (Binxian soil and Keshan soil) in the Mollisols (black soil) of Northeast China were selected to analyse the detachment and transport characteristics of aggregate fragments under different splash distances (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40 and 40-50 cm) through simulated rainfall experiments. Different concentrations of KCl electrolyte (from 1 to 10(-5) mol L-1) were employed as rainfall materials to regulate soil internal forces. The results revealed that the net pressure of soil internal forces and splash amount presented the same trend with decreasing electrolyte concentration, that is, increased initially (from 1 to 10(-2) mol L-1), followed by levelling off (from 10(-2) to 10(-5) mol L-1). The splash amount and net pressure had an exponential relationship (p < 0.01). Under the same electrolyte concentration, Binxian soil had a higher net pressure and splash amount than Keshan soil. The splash amount for the two soils was mostly distributed at a splash distance of 0-20 cm, and it exponentially decreased with increasing splash distance (p < 0.01). An empirical expression in our study was developed to predict the splash amount (M) based on the net pressure (N) and splash distance (S). The size distribution of splashed aggregates could be affected by the net pressure of soil internal forces, the greater the net pressure, the smaller size aggregates splashed. At each splash distance, the highest mass percentage was observed for the fragments The distribution characteristics of aggregate fragments under different soil internal forces were tested. Relations between soil internal forces and soil aggregate detachment were determined. The distribution of splashed aggregates size was greatly affected by soil internal forces. Soil internal forces had important effects on splash erosion in the Mollisols of Northeast China.

Understanding how deep soil water (DSW) is replenished and subsequently depleted by deep-rooted fruit trees, therefore, are important for informing sustainable water resources management particularly in arid regions. In this study, we collected soil samples from the surface down to 20 m under four land use types (farmland, 8-year apple orchard, 12-year peach orchard, and 25-year apple orchard) in China's Loess Plateau. We then measured the soil water content, stable (delta H-2 and delta O-18) and radioactive (H-3) isotopic compositions. The radioactive isotope was used to constrain the age of soil water while the stable isotopes were used to determine the types of storms that would have contributed to recharging the DSW. We then implemented a soil water balance model to identify the mechanisms underlying the changes in DSW. Mechanistically, our results show that water movement in these soils was predominantly via piston flow. The age of DSW below 8 m was determined to be older than 55 years. Altogether, these results support an interpretation that DSW may have only been recharged by high-intensity, low-frequency rainfall events during the wet season (July to September), but that the magnitude of DSW recharge was likely to be influenced by subsequent water mining by deep-rooted fruit trees. The deep-rooted fruit trees consumed more DSW than farmland vegetation, substantially limiting the magnitude of DSW recharge under the orchards. Our simple soil water balance model, informed by water stable isotopes and supplemented with information from tritium, provides a technique for partitioning soil water balance (SWB) and insights into the long-term effects of land use change on water resources in arid regions.

J	Williams, TG; Dressler, G; Stratton, AE; Mueller, B				Williams, Tim G.; Dressler, Gunnar; Stratton, Anne Elise; Muller, Birgit			Ecological and financial strategies provide complementary benefits for smallholder climate resilience: insights from a simulation model	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY												Researchers and development organizations regularly grapple with competing ecological and financial strategies for building climate resilience in smallholder agricultural systems, but rarely are such approaches considered in tandem. Using a socialecological simulation model, we explored how different combinations of legume cover cropping, an ecological insurance, and index-based crop insurance, a financial insurance, affect the climate resilience of mixed crop-livestock smallholder farmers over time. The model simulates interactions between soil nutrient dynamics, crop yields, and household wealth, which is carried solely in the form of livestock. We assume legume cover cropping provides biological nitrogen fixation, thereby increasing soil fertility and productivity over time, whereas microinsurance gives payouts in drought years that provide ex-post coping benefits. Our model results indicate that the benefits of cover cropping to mean household income strongly complement the shock-absorbing benefits of microinsurance. Specifically, we found: (1) insurance always provides larger benefits during and in the wake of a drought, while cover cropping progressively reduces poverty in the medium- to long-term; (2) the use of crop insurance solely as an ex-post coping strategy may not reduce the incidence of poverty; and (3) legume cover cropping offers larger relative benefits in more degraded environments and for poor farmers. These results underscore the complementary roles that ecological and financial strategies could play in building resilience in smallholder agricultural systems. The stylized model constitutes an important social-ecological foundation for future empirical research to inform agricultural innovation and sustainable development priorities.

The primary challenge in developing a robotic daylily harvester is recognizing mature bud in the unstructured and uncertain environment. The objective of this study is to propose an accurate detection model. Hemerocallis citrina cv. 'DatongHuanghua' variety is used in this study. We initially adopt VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, ResNet101 and ResNet152 as the backbones of Faster R-CNN respectively to build different detection models. The experimental results show that VGG19 and ResNet50 are two best-performing models in the corresponding VGGNet and ResNet, and the Average Precision (AP) of VGG19 is 90.18%, while ResNet50 is 88.35%. Based on these, we further integrate Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) in Faster R-CNN with three different integration modes: plugging CBAM behind Conv5_x of VGG19 and ResNet50 respectively, as well as between every two "bottleneck" blocks of ResNet50. The comparison demonstrate plugging CBAM between every two blocks of ResNet50 is the best integration mode, and the corresponding detection model has a 2.22% highest increase in AP. Therefore, we empirically validate the performance of detection model for daylily mature bud based on Faster R-CNN integrated with CBAM.																			2169-3536						2023	11						81646	81655		10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3299595	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3299595													WOS:001047306400001

This study was conducted to investigate the soil detachment rate responds to plant-induce soil properties and root traits at species level. Two typical herbaceous plants, Bothriochloa ischcemum (Linn.). Keng (BI; fibrous root system) and Artemisia vestita Wall. ex Bess (AG; tap root system), from the Loess Plateau were studies for one year under six planted densities of 5 plants m(-2), 10 plants m(-2), 15 plants m(-2) 20 plants m(-2), 25 plants m(-2), and 30 plants m(-2). In total, 24 steel tanks were planted, and two plots were used as bare soil controls. Their soil detachment rates were tested under a constant overland flow (1.5 l s(-1)) on a 26.2 % slope. The results showed that soil detachment rate under the six planted densities ranged from 0.034 kg m(2) s(-1) to 0.112 kg m(2) s(-1) for BI and was ranged from 0.053 kg m(2) s(-1) to 0.132 kg m(2) s(-1) for AG, which all greatly reduced soil detachment rate and were 68.17 % to 92.33 % and 69.20 % to 87.27 % less than that of the control. In general, BI was more effective in reducing soil detachment rate than AG, achieving a mean soil detachment rate that was 23.75 % lower. With increasing plant density, soil detachment rate decreased as a power function. The overland flow hydraulic characteristics, soil properties and root traits influenced by plant density were positively or negatively correlated with soil detachment rate. Specifically, soil detachment rate decreased with velocity, bulk density, root length density, and increased with shear stress and Darcy-Weisbach friction factor as power or exponential functions. On this basis, the soil detachment rate (Dr) can be satisfactorily estimated by overland flow velocity (v), soil bulk density (BD) and root length density (RLD) as a power function (Dr= 63.03v(0.174) x BD-20.712 x RLD-0.233 R-2= 0.65; NSE= 0.60; p < 0.01).

Fitness consequences of host colonization in two generalist fleas: Context-dependency and the effect of spatial co-occurrence	MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY												We studied the fitness consequences of colonizing a novel host by experimental lines of fleas (Synosternus cleopatrae and Xenopsylla ramesis) maintained for 18-22 generations on the principal or novel (sympatric or allopatric) hosts via number, developmental success and size of the offspring of the fleas exploiting these hosts. We asked whether (a) fitness on non-principal hosts increases after prolonged maintenance; (b) the colonization success depends on the spatial co-occurrence of a flea and a host and (c) colonization of a novel host is accompanied by a decreased ability to exploit an original host. The ability of fleas to colonize novel hosts differed between species, with S. cleopatrae, but not X. ramesis, increasing its offspring production on novel hosts. Spatial co-occurrence did not affect colonization success. Maintenance on an alternative host was not accompanied by decreased adaptation to the original host. When fleas returned to the original host, their reproductive output was higher than that of their ancestors. We conclude that the success of colonizing a novel host is (a) context-dependent and varies between flea and host species and (b) not accompanied by the loss of ability to exploit an ancestral host but may lead to an increase in this ability.

J	Ren, XH; Zou, WJ; Jiao, JY; Stewart, R; Jian, JS				Ren, Xiaohua; Zou, Wenjing; Jiao, Juying; Stewart, Ryan; Jian, Jinshi			Soil properties affect crop yield changes under conservation agriculture: A systematic analysis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Conservation agriculture (CA) has the potential to sustain soil productivity and benefit agroecosystems, yet it is not fully understood how yield responses of different cropping systems are affected by inherent soil characteristics, for example, texture and dynamic soil properties, such as aggregation, nutrients and erosion. In this study, we conducted a systematic review to compare crop yield from cropland with conventional management versus different CA practices, specifically reduced- or no-tillage, agroforestry, organic farming and cover crops. The data were first analysed for different climatic regions, soil textures and cash crop types. We then quantified how yield responses correlated with soil properties change under different CA practices. The results showed that CA practices were associated with an overall mean crop yield increase of 12%. This response was primarily driven by corn, which had a mean yield increase of almost 41% after CA implementation, whereas other cash crops did not have significant yield responses or showed slight decreases, as rotation with mixtures of multiple cash crops had a mean decrease of 6% when using CA. The increase in corn yield after CA may be related to the enhanced ability of that crop to absorb nutrient elements (e.g. nitrogen) and reduce nutrient leaching. Agroforestry increased crop yield by 66% and cover cropping increased yield by 11%, likely due to increases in soil water content and nutrient availability and decreases in erosion and surface runoff. However, other agricultural systems showed no significant increase after CA compared with conventional row cropping practices. Using CA practices had the greatest yield benefit in tropical climates and when farming in coarse-textured soils. In addition, legumes and grass-legume mixtures resulted in significant cash crop yield increases, possibly because legumes promoted the increase of soil nitrogen and depleted soil moisture less compared with other cover crops. The results provide new insight into how interactions between soil properties and CA practices affect crop yield and at the same time can help guide the development of practical, evidence-based guidelines for using conservation practices to improve yield in corn and other cash crops.																			1351-0754	1365-2389				SEP	2023	74	5							e13413	10.1111/ejss.13413	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13413													WOS:001069508600001

Despite being a major producer and consumer of chickpeas, Ethiopia experiences lower yields due to biotic and abiotic stresses, particularly insect pest infestations during storage. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of different storage technologies and durations on the losses of stored chickpea seeds in terms of both quantity and quality. The experiment involved five storage technologies and three durations, spanning a period of 6 months, with data collected at 2-month intervals. The results showed that the Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) and Super GrainPro (SGP) bags effectively maintained intergranular temperature, seed moisture content, and relative humidity throughout the storage period, followed by the modified hermetic metal silo. In contrast, traditional bags exhibited a significant increase in these parameters. The PICS and SGP bags also exhibited the lowest numbers of total insect pests after 6 months, while the jute bags had the highest infestation. Common insect species found in the stored chickpea seeds were Callosobruchus chinensis (L.), Sitophilus oryzae (L.), and Tribolium confusum (duVal). Furthermore, hermetic bags (PICS and SGP) demonstrated the least grain damage and weight loss, while jute bags had relatively higher values. Seed viability was well maintained in hermetic bags but significantly decreased in traditional bags. Overall, hermetic storage technologies, such as the PICS and SGP bags, effectively suppressed insect development, reduced losses, and preserved seed viability without the need for insecticides. It is recommended that farmers use these hermetic storage bags after proper drying to enhance food security and income generation. By implementing these recommendations, Ethiopia can enhance its chickpea storage practices, reduce post-harvest losses, and contribute to improved food security and economic sustainability in the chickpea sector. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry. Choice of storage container significantly affects the damage to chickpea seeds during storage. The use of traditional jute bags and polypropylene bags resulted in high percentages of seed damage, particularly after a prolonged storage period. In contrast, hermetic PICS and SGP bags showed much lower percentages of seed damage, and the damage did not significantly increase with an increase in storage time.image						berhe, muez/0000-0002-9989-9102; Bhadriraju, Subramanyam/0000-0003-4481-6020													1526-498X	1526-4998				2023 OCT 10	2023										10.1002/ps.7781	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.7781		OCT 2023						37732837					WOS:001078125000001
J	Xing, K; Zhang, SM; Jia, MQ; Zhao, F				Xing, Kun; Zhang, Shu-Ming; Jia, Mei-Qi; Zhao, Fei			Response of wheat aphid to insecticides is influenced by the interaction between temperature amplitudes and insecticide characteristics	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY												Introduction: Climate change not only directly affects the phenotype of organisms but also indirectly impacts their physiology, for example, by altering their susceptibility to insecticides. Changed diurnal temperature fluctuations are an important aspect of climate change; ignoring the impact of these fluctuations on the biological effects of various chemical insecticides can lead to inaccurate assessments of insecticide risk under the current and future climate change scenarios. Methods: In this study, we studied effects of different temperature amplitudes (+/- 0, +/- 6, +/- 12 degrees C) at the same mean temperature (22 degrees C) on the life history traits of a globally distributed pest (Sitobion avenae, wheat aphid), in response to low doses of two insecticides. The first, imidacloprid shows a positive temperature coefficient; the second, beta-cypermethrin has a negative temperature coefficient. Results: Compared with the results seen with the constant temperature (22 degrees C), a wide temperature amplitude (+/- 12 degrees C) amplified the negative effects of imidacloprid on the survival, longevity, and fecundity of S. avenae, but significantly increased the early fecundity of the wheat aphid. Beta-cypermethrin positively impacted the wheat aphid at all temperature amplitudes studied. Specifically, beta-cypermethrin significantly increased the survival, longevity, and fecundity of S. avenae under medium temperature amplitude (+/- 6 degrees C). There were no significant differences in the survival, longevity, and the early fecundity of S. avenae when it was treated with beta-cypermethrin at the wide temperature amplitude (+/- 12 degrees C). However, the negative effect of beta-cypermethrin on the intrinsic rate of increase of S. avenae decreased gradually with the increase in temperature amplitude. Discussion: In conclusion, the response of S. avenae to positive temperature coefficient insecticides was markedly affected by temperature amplitude, while negative temperature coefficient insecticides increased the environmental adaptability of S. avenae to various temperature amplitudes. Our results highlight the importance of the integrated consideration of diurnal temperature fluctuations and different temperature coefficient insecticide interactions in climate-change-linked insecticide risk assessment; these results emphasize the need for a more fine-scale approach within the context of climate change and poison sensitivity.																				1664-042X				APR 24	2023	14								1188917	10.3389/fphys.2023.1188917	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2023.1188917								37168226					WOS:000982680500001

It is important to understand the interactions among plant, soil and microbial biomass carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stoichiometry under different conditions of resource supply. We conducted a pot experiment on 1-year-old Robinia pseudoacacia seedlings for nearly 5 months under different water, nitrogen and phosphorus supplies, and we determined plant, soil and microbial biomass C, N and P stoichiometry. We found that plant, soil and microbial nutrients and stoichiometry exhibited a certain degree of plasticity in response to the changes in water and nutrient conditions in their environments. Variation partitioning analysis showed that root stoichiometry accounted for a large part of the variance in microbial stoichiometry. Structural equation modeling further revealed that root stoichiometry and leaf stoichiometry were two direct factors affecting microbial biomass C:N and C:P, and that root stoichiometry had the greatest direct effect. In addition, the degree of homeostasis for microbial biomass C and C:P was more sensitive to changes in soil nutrients than changes in other factors, and other elements and elemental ratios displayed strict homeostasis. These results highlight the importance of studying microbial stoichiometry in improving our understanding of nutrient cycling of the plant-soil system under different water and nutrient supply.																			1752-9921	1752-993X				OCT 1	2022	15	5					991	1006		10.1093/jpe/rtac011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jpe/rtac011													WOS:000860845700005
J	Wang, J; Liu, GB; Zhang, C; Wang, GL				Wang, Jie; Liu, Guobin; Zhang, Chao; Wang, Guoliang			Effect of long-term destocking on soil fungal functional groups and interactions with plants	PLANT AND SOIL												Aims While the effects of destocking on soil nutrient and plant productivity are known, the effect on functional groups of fungi has received less attention. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of long-term destocking on fungal functional guilds and their association with plants and soil. Methods We characterized the changes in five fungal functional guilds, including plant pathogens, animal pathogens, wood saprotrophs, dung saprotrophs, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), along a 35-year chronosequence following destocking at 0-60 cm soil depths on the Chinese Loess Plateau. Fungal community composition was assigned by comparing with the FUNGuild database. Results After 35 years of destocking, diversities of plant pathogens, wood saprotrophs, and AMF increased, while that of animal pathogens and dung saprotrophs decreased. Destocking had a greater effect in the near-surface layers (0-10 and 10-20 cm) owing to the greater influence of plant biomass and soil nutrients. Among the above- and belowground drivers, plant pathogen diversity was largely associated with plant diversity, while animal pathogens, dung saprotrophs, and wood saprotrophs were associated with aboveground biomass, AMF were responsive to soil conditions (e.g., organic C, NO3--N, C:N ratio, and moisture). Conclusions Long-term destocking can be considered to be an important predictor of fungal functional guilds, and changes in these microorganisms were associated with cessation-induced shifts in plants and soil by grazing. Our findings provide insights into the duration of destocking necessary to benefit fungal communities, and how this varies according to soil depth.

CLIMATE CHANGE-INDUCED RANGE SHIFTS IN CHINESE ASH (<i>FRAXINUS CHINENSIS</i>) ALONG THREE GEOGRAPHICAL DIMENSIONS IN CHINA AT THE LATE 21ST CENTURY br	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												In the present study, we establish a set of indicator systems to characterize the shifts in total range and core range of Chinese ash (Fraxinus chinensis) at three geographical dimensions under climate change scenarios in China by the year of 2070. The results show that current core range and total range areas were 1.3 x 106 km2 and 3.3 x 106 km2, accounting for 13.5% and 34.4% of the land area in China. The size of core range and total range areas will increase in varying degrees, depending on the CO2 emission concentration path. The average of future core range and total range areas were 1.95 x 106 km2 and 3.7 x 106 km2 across climate change scenarios, accounting for 20.3% and 38.5% of the land area in China. But, there was a difference in the centroid shift velocity and direction between the core and total ranges at the horizontal gradient. The average shift speed of total range is 11.39 km/decade toward northwest and that for core range is 9.32 km/decade toward northeast across climate scenarios. The average shift speed of the core range -9.05 m/decade downward and that for total range is 17.15 m/decade upward across climate change scenarios. This study indicates that the response of total range and core distribution range to climate change is not synchronous. Considering poleward or northward shift will underestimate about 2.2-20.1% for total range and 21.2-56.3% for core range. Thus, the study have important guiding significance for determining the potential shift route and adjust the shift speed for planting the tree species in response to future climate change. The indicator systems used here have a wide range of practicability and can applied to any species, region, or time.																			1589-1623	1785-0037				2022 JUL 26	2022										10.15666/aeer/2005_44994513	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/2005_44994513		JUL 2022											WOS:000862834800001

Biological control of this disease is considered more environmentally safe, but the biological control agents have limited availability. The fungus Trichoderma can be used as a biocontrol agent for various plant diseases, including brown spots. Indigenous Trichoderma species from West Timor were evaluated in this study to reveal their effectiveness in reducing brown spot disease of upland rice. The study was conducted under a screen house condition using a factorial treatment design laid out in a completely randomized design. The two factors were the brown spot disease control method (T. viride, T. harzianum, T. hamatum, fungicide Trivia 73 WP, and a control treatment) and upland rice genotype (Inpago 7 and Breun Senaren 2). Results The results showed that Trichoderma spp. and the fungicide Trivia 73 WP caused significantly lower AUDPC and apparent infection rate than the control treatment. The total phenol content and agronomic characters (number of reproductive tillers per plant, number of filled grains per panicle, grain yield per plant) were higher in the Trichoderma and fungicide treatments than the control treatment. Meanwhile, tannin and saponin levels were non-significantly different among treatments. Trichoderma and the fungicide Trivia treatments effectively suppressed brown spot disease of upland rice, and the efficacy was dependent on the rice variety, with a mean efficacy range over the two varieties of 27.05-36.42%. The Trichoderma and the fungicide Trivia treatments increased the grain yield per plant differentially in the 2 rice varieties, with a mean grain yield increase over the 2 varieties of 13.0% (T. viride), 23.5% (T. harzianum), 35.0% (T. hamatum), and 19.9% (Trivia 73 WP). Conclusion Efficacy of local Trichoderma of West Timor and the fungicide Trivia treatments were varietal dependent with T. hamatum being the most effective in reducing the brown spot disease and producing the highest grain yield increase over the 2 rice varieties. The local Trichoderma species of West Timor have a future potential as biocontrol agents of upland rice brown spot disease, but it is necessary to further evaluate their effectiveness against the disease in replicated field trials.

However, the process of sublimation drying is constrained by its substantial time and energy costs. To comprehensively grasp its technological process and identify the optimal process parameters, the cellular automata method was employed for sublimation process simulation. Carrot slices, measuring 10 mm in thickness and 40 mm in radius, were selected for both simulation and experimentation. The sublimation process was characterized using a two-dimensional heat and mass transfer equation, inclusive of a dusty gas model. Additionally, a cellular automaton model was applied to simulate the mass transfer process, temperature, and moisture content changes in the sublimation drying stage. Then, the accuracy of the model was verified through experimentation. There was a remarkable alignment between simulation and experimental outcomes, with determination coefficients R2 of 99.4% for moisture content and 97.6% for temperature variations.

A field experiment for two consecutive years (2013 to 2015) was conducted to evaluate the responses of wheat crop to exogenous application of plant bio-regulators (PBRs) in the water-scarce Deccan region of India (Baramati, Pune, Maharashtra). We predicted grain and biomass yields of wheat using water stress-sensitive spectral indices under varied water regimes. The water regimes were seven levels of irrigation water (equaling to 1.00, 0.85, 0.70, 0.55, 0.40, 0.25 and 0.10 times of cumulative open pan evaporation, CPE) and applied using a line-source sprinkler system). There were five PBRs, viz. thiourea, salicylic acid, potassium nitrate, gibberellin and ortho-silicic, with concentration 10 mM, 10 mu M, 15 g L-1, 25 ppm and 8 ppm, respectively, applied at various growth stages, namely crown root initiation, flag leaf and seed milking stages. Water stress indices were computed from spectral reflectance pattern recorded at different crop growth stages using ASD FieldSpec-4 Spectroradiometer (350-2500 nm). The PBRs significantly influenced the canopy reflectance pattern and maintained superior values of water stress indices over the control (without PBRs) by stabilizing leaf pigments and water contents, controlling the stomatal opening and better water use. Among the five PBRs, thiourea and salicylic acid mitigated water stress better and improved overall grain yield (4.6-17.5%) and total biomass (3.6-15.3%). There was no significant (p < 0.05) variation in both yields (grains and biomass) up to IW: CPE 0.70, indicating that irrigation scheduling at 0.70 IW: CPE could be a better option rather than full irrigation in water-scarce areas. At flowering and milking stages, all spectral indices were correlated significantly with the wheat yields. Thus, these stages could be considered as more water-sensitive stages during entire wheat growth period. Regression models based on WI and NWI-2 accounted for 92% and 78% variation in the observed yields for grain and biomass, respectively, with minimum root-mean square error. Hence, to predict the grain and biomass yields of wheat, regression models based on WI and NWI-2 at milking stage can be used successfully.

We investigated the anatomical and physiological differences among different root orders. Tomato plants were grown in either polyethylene bags or a hydroponic system. Mineral uptake, protein profiles, respiration rates, and anatomical profiles of the different root orders were measured. First-order roots absorbed significantly more nutrients than the other root orders. The concentrations of elements surrounding the third-order roots remained constant throughout the experiment. Respiration rates were found to be higher in the first- and second-order roots than in the third-order roots. Analysis of anatomical cross-sections demonstrated different structures in the different root orders. Protein profile analysis presented differences in different root orders, these proteins included element transporters and those related to protein translocation in the cell. Moreover, specific proteins related to mineral absorption were found at higher levels in the first- and second-order roots than in the third-order roots. Our results demonstrate, that different root orders vary in their nutrient uptake and translocation and that distal root orders play a key role in the uptake and translocation of minerals.					孙, 晓茜/JLM-7573-2023; Rachmilevitch, Shimon/F-1329-2012	Rachmilevitch, Shimon/0000-0003-3600-5949													0098-8472	1873-7307				NOV	2020	179								104212	10.1016/j.envexpbot.2020.104212	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2020.104212													WOS:000571851700004
J	Ge, ZP				Ge, Zhenpeng			The hidden order of Turing patterns in arid and semi-arid vegetation ecosystems	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Vegetation Turing patterns play a critical role in the ecological functioning of arid and semi-arid ecosystems. However, the long-range spatial features of these patterns have been neglected compared to short-range features like patch shape and spatial wavelength. Drawing inspiration from hyperuniform structures in material science, we find that the arid and semi-arid vegetation Turing pattern exhibits long-range dispersion similar to hyperuniformity. As the degree of hyperuniformity of the vegetation Turing pattern increases, so does the water-use efficiency of the vegetation. This finding supports previous studies that suggest that Turing patterns represent a spatially optimized self-organization of ecosystems for water acquisition. The degree of hyperuniformity of Turing-type ecosystems exhibits significant critical slowing down near the tipping point, indicating that these ecosystems have non-negligible transient dynamical behavior. Reduced rainfall not only decreases the resilience of the steady state of the ecosystem but also slows down the rate of spatial optimization of water-use efficiency in long transient regimes. We propose that the degree of hyperuniformity indicates the spatial resilience of Turing-type ecosystems after strong, short-term disturbances. Spatially heterogeneous disturbances that reduce hyperuniformity lead to longer recovery times than spatially homogeneous disturbances that maintain hyperuniformity.

Slope situation can alter revegetation and its effects on soil properties and root traits, and thus may affect soil erodibility. However, whether slope situation will change the effect of revegetation on soil erodibility through improving soil properties and root traits has rarely been evaluated. Therefore, this study was conducted to detect the response of soil erodibility to slope situations (loess-tableland, hill-slope and gullyslope) in a typical watershed of the Loess Plateau. Five soil erodibility parameters (saturated soil hydraulicconductivity, SHe mean weight diameter of aggregates, MWD: clay ratio, CR: soil disintegration rate, SDR; soil erodibility factor, K) and a comprehensive soil erodibility index (CSEI) are selected to darify the study targets. The results revealed that soil properties, root traits, soil erodibility parameters and GE( were affected by slope situation significantly. Soil and root can explain 79.7%, 79.1% and 69.8% of total variance in soil erodibility of loess-tableland, hillslope and gully-slope, respectively. Slope situation influenced soil erodibility by changing the effects of revegetation on soil properties and root traits. Evidently, the slope situation greatly changed the relations between CSEI and soil and root parameters, whereafter a model considering slope situation (slope steepness), sand, organic matter content and root surface area density was reliable to estimate soil erodibility (CSEI). Our study suggested that the Armeniaca sibirica, the combination of Bothriochloa ischcemum and Robinia pseudoacacia and the combination of Armeniaca sibirica and Lespedeza bicolor can be used as the optimal selection for mitigating soil erodibility of loess-tableland, hill-slope and gully-slope, respectively. This study is of great significance in optimizing the spatial layout of soil and water conservation measures for different slope situations of the Loess Plateau. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this study was to comprehensively evaluate economic yield (EYyield), dry matter yield (DMyield), crude protein yield (CPyield), wheat equivalent yield (WEyield), and food equivalent yield (FEUyield) when incorporating annual forages (oat [Avena sativa L.], soybean [Glycine max L.], and vetch [Vicia sativa L.]) into the traditional fallow-winter wheat system from a 4-year (2016-2020) experiment on the Loess Plateau of China. Results showed that incorporating annual forages into the continuous wheat system significantly increased system productivity. Among the four growing seasons, average system DMyield values for fallow-winter wheat (F-W), oat-winter wheat (O-W), soybean-winter wheat (S-W), and vetch-winter wheat (V-W) were 10348.52, 13854.15, 14679.94, and 12185.29 kg ha(-1), respectively. The average wheat EYyield values were 3777.82, 3115.19, 4020.76, and 3180.71 kg ha(-1), respectively. The average forage DMyield values were 0.00, 5497.19, 4284.64, and 2817.50 kg ha(-1), respectively. The S-W system had the highest DMyield and CPyield (1350.10 kg ha(-1)), and also had DMyield with the smallest variation (CV = 15.21%). The O-W, S-W, and V-W systems produced FEUyield values that were 48.67%, 68.46%, and 30.53%, respectively, greater than the F-W system. When considering market prices and yields, the S-W system increased wheat gain yield and had the highest WEyield (6607.90 kg ha(-1)). Therefore, in consideration of forage quality, winter wheat production, and system productivity, we recommend the S-W system for local farmers on the Loess Plateau.																			0011-183X	1435-0653				JUL	2023	63	4					2524	2538		10.1002/csc2.21024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/csc2.21024		JUN 2023											WOS:001004593500001

Hybrids in Northwest New Mexico for the 2003-2019 Period	AGRICULTURE-BASEL												The highly variable weather under changing climate conditions affects the establishment and the cutoff of crop growing season and exposes crops to failure if producers choose non-adapted relative maturity that matches the characteristics of the crop growing season. This study aimed to determine the relationship between maize hybrid relative maturity and the grain yield and determine the relative maturity range that will sustain maize production in northwest New Mexico (NM). Different relative maturity maize hybrids were grown at the Agricultural Science Center at Farmington ((Latitude 36.69 degrees North, Longitude 108.31 degrees West, elevation 1720 m) from 2003 to 2019 under sprinkler irrigation. A total of 343 hybrids were grouped as early and full season hybrids according to their relative maturity that ranged from 93 to 119 and 64 hybrids with unknown relative maturity. The crops were grown under optimal management condition with no stress of any kind. The results showed non-significant increase in grain yield in early season hybrids and non-significant decrease in grain yield with relative maturity in full season hybrids. The relative maturity range of 100-110 obtained reasonable high grain yields and could be considered under the northwestern New Mexico climatic conditions. However, more research should target the evaluation of different planting date coupled with plant population density to determine the planting window for the early season and full season hybrids for the production optimization and sustainability.

However, the proportion of jet flow and on-wall flow induced by headcut and its effects on soil loss and plunge pool morphology are still unclear. A simulated flow-scouring experiment was conducted to explore the proportion of jet flow and on-wall flow and their contributions to soil loss and the effect of on-wall flow erosion on plunge pool morphology under different flow discharge (q(0) = 3.0-7.2 m(3) h(-1)) and headwall height (H-0 = 0.3-1.2 m) conditions. Our results showed that jet flow and on-wall flow accounted 15.7% - 22.6% and 77.4% - 84.3% of total flow volume upstream headcut, respectively. Jet flow, on-wall flow and their interaction contributed 53.5%, 34.9% and 11.6% of total soil loss amount, respectively. Furthermore, H-0 exhibited greater effect on soil loss caused by jet flow and its interaction with on-wall flow, but the soil loss caused by on-wall was mainly controlled by q(0). The width and depth of plunge pool logarithmically increased with scouring time, and the q(0) and H-0 significantly affected the development of plunge pool morphology. On-wall flow reduced plunge pool depth by 27.8%-71.4%, and it weakened plunge pool width by 24.3%-57.3% only under H-0 of 0.3-0.9 m, but for H-0 of 1.2 m and q(0) of >4.8 m(3) h(-1), it improved the plunge pool width by 7.5%. The energy consumption of jet flow showed the closest relationship with plunge pool morphology. The concentrated flow upstream gully head exhibited the stronger effect on plunge pool morphology than H-0. This study is helpful to deepen the understanding of gully erosion mechanism and provide scientific reference for the design of gully erosion prevention and control measures.

However, the mechanism by which SOC dynamics and sequestration respond to stand density is not well understood in Robinia pseudoacacia plantations. Here, we analyzed R. pseudoacacia plantations in the loess hillygully region of northern Shaanxi Province, China with three stand densities: 750 trees ha(-1) (low-density), 1125 trees ha(-1) (medium-density) and 1550 trees ha(-1) (high-density). We determined the effects of stand density on SOC, SOC fractions, microbial carbon (C) use efficiency (CUE), and microbial C metabolism function. In particular, soil microbial metabolism function was investigated with the Biolog-ECO microplate. Carbohydrates and amino acids were the main available C sources for soil microbes in R. pseudoacacia plantations. Microbial biomass C (MBC), mineral-associated organic C (MOC), and dissolved organic C (DOC) content were the highest in high-density plantations, whereas easily oxidizable C (EOC) content, the MBC/SOC ratio, the DOC/SOC ratio, and the EOC/SOC ratio were the lowest in high-density plantations. Compared with low- and medium-density plantations, the average SOC content in high-density plantations increased by 61% and 52%, respectively. Across all stands, the MOC/SOC ratio ranged from 32% to 65%, whereas labile C accounted for only a minor portion of SOC (20 +/- 8%). A substantially higher CUE and lower microbial metabolic activity were found in high-density plantations. Pearson correlation analysis showed that SOC content was significantly positively correlated with above-ground litter biomass and CUE but was significantly negatively correlated with microbial metabolic activity and liable C/SOC ratios. Mantel tests showed that soil nitrogen (N) level and the microbial biomass C/N ratio were the main factors affecting SOC quantity and stability changes. These results suggested that R. pseudoacacia plantations under high density increased SOC sequestration by increasing C input via aboveground litter and decreased C loss by improving microbial CUE and suppressing microbial metabolic activity. Thus, increasing stand density may be an effective tool for improving SOC sequestration in R. pseudoacacia plantations.																			0167-8809	1873-2305				FEB 28	2023	343								108256	10.1016/j.agee.2022.108256	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2022.108256													WOS:001106625900001

Extraneous N and P fertilization is an efficient management measure to enhance grassland productivity and accelerate grassland restoration. However, biodiversity decline and species loss induced by N and P addition must be noticed. Two grassland communities dominated by tall clonal grass (TCG) and tall clonal forb (TCF) on Loess Plateau were selected. A two-year split-plot experiment (main-plot 0, 25, 50, and 100 kgN ha(-1) yr(-1); subplot 0, 20, 40 and 80 kg P2O5 ha(-1) yr(-1)) was conducted to evaluate the effect of N and P addition on aboveground net primary production (ANPP), light availability, diversity and functional group composition. N and P addition slightly increased ANPP mainly benefiting from clonal species and had few effects on species composition and diversity due to the deficient precipitation during growing season in 2017. However, N or P addition alone resulted in significant ANPP increase, and adding N and P together had larger effects in 2018. The changes in ANPP and diversity after P alone addition were driven by legumes. The ANPP responses to 50 and 100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) combined with P addition in 2018 were mainly driven by pronounced increases in tall clonal or annual species. This large shift of species composition caused diversity decline only in TCF community. The extent of diversity decline was significantly correlated with the degree of light availability reduction. Diversity decline in TCF was a result of strong and uniform light availability reduction induced by increased tall annual forb. Tall clonal and annual species are the key functional groups that drive changes in productivity and diversity in the two communities. The optimum N and P amount to tradeoff productivity improvement and diversity decline were 50 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 20 kg P2O5 ha(-1) yr(-1) combination for TCG and 25 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 20 kg P2O5 ha(-1) yr(-1) combination for TCF.

J	Huang, YN; Evaristo, J; Li, Z				Huang, Yanan; Evaristo, Jaivime; Li, Zhi			Multiple tracers reveal different groundwater recharge mechanisms in deep loess deposits	GEODERMA												Interpretation of groundwater recharge mechanisms is problematic because of the muted instantaneous response of subsurface water to rainfall and limited recharge rates, particularly in semi-arid environments with deep loess deposits. Here we identify the possible groundwater recharge mechanisms in 200-m thick loess deposits with unsaturated zone thickness of over 40 m. We collected soil samples up to 15 m deep under four land use types (one grassland and three apple orchards with stand ages 15, 24 and 30 years old), and used three-year precipitation and groundwater samples to determine the contents of stable water isotopes, chloride, and tritium. Our overarching goal is to determine the relative importance of piston and preferential flow in groundwater recharge using multiple tracers and quantify the effects of land use change on groundwater recharge. We find that while both piston and preferential flows are important in groundwater recharge, the unsaturated and saturated zones have yet to come to hydraulic equilibrium. This suggests different groundwater recharge mechanisms: tracers in the unsaturated zone suggest piston flow, while the detectable tritium in the saturated zone implies preferential flow. Recharge rates in the unsaturated zones range between 23 and 82 mm year(-1), accounting for 4%-14% of mean annual precipitation, and increasing with depth presumably because of land use and/or climatic conditions. Total recharge rate in the saturated zone is 112.6 +/- 44.1 mm year(-1), accounting for 19 +/- 9% of mean annual precipitation. Overall, our study finds that piston flow contributes more to total recharge (53%-69%) than does preferential flow. Nevertheless, piston flow may become less important because of land use change (farmland to apple orchard conversion). Our findings have implications for the need to strike a delicate balance between the economic gains from afforestation and the possible risks to groundwater supply sustainability.

The results showed consistent interspecific variability as well as important and significant intraspecific differences, which could depend on genotype and environment. Four of the five investigated genotypes can provide an amount of several essential mineral elements high enough to meet 100% of the recommended dietary allowance for all age groups <= 8 years. For all the genotypes, no health risks associated with their consumption emerged for Cr, As, and Pb, but Al, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn and Ni is > 1 showed evidence of greater health risk, especially in children. This study investigated the influence of the agro-climatic environment of Northern Ethiopia on the content of essential mineral elements of selected orange-fleshed sweetpotato genotypes, the potential contribution of each genotype's essential mineral elements to the recommended dietary allowance, and the potential risk to human health from the accumulation of potentially toxic elements in the tuberous roots of the studied genotypes. The results showed consistent interspecific variations in the content of essential mineral elements among the studied orange-fleshed sweetpotato genotypes, as well as important intraspecific differences, which could depend on the variations in soil mineral and organic matter content, rainfall, temperature, as well as interactions between genotype and environment. The investigated genotypes, especially Kulfo, Ininda, Gloria, and Amelia, can provide an amount of several essential mineral elements high enough to meet 100% of the recommended dietary allowance for all age groups <= 8 years. The mean content of potentially toxic elements in tuberous roots and their daily intake values were within the recommended permissible levels; likewise, no health risk was associated with the consumption of these genotypes for Cr, As, and Pb. However, Al, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Ni is > 1, consumption imposes health risks based on daily accumulation.

However, it is difficult to use a single biochar material to overcome problems such as low adsorption efficiency, difficulty in reuse, and secondary pollution. This study addresses these challenges using a novel core-shell structure gamma-Al2O3/Fe3O4 biochar adsorbent (AFBC) with significant P uptake capabilities in terms of its high adsorption capacity (205.7 mg g(-1)), magnetic properties (saturation magnetization 24.70 emu g(-1)), and high reuse stability (91.0% removal efficiency after five adsorption-desorption cycles). The highest partition coefficient 1.04 mg g(-1) mu M-1, was obtained at a concentration of 322.89 mu M. Furthermore, AFBC exhibited strong regeneration ability in multiple cycle trials, making it extremely viable for sustainable resource management. P removal mechanisms, i.e., electrostatic attraction and inner-sphere complexation, were explained using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. A surface complexation model was established by considering the formation of monodentate mononuclear and bidentate binuclear surface complexes of P to illustrate the adsorption process. Owing to its high adsorption efficiency, easy separation from water, and environmental friendliness, AFBC is a potential adsorbent for P recovery from polluted waters. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known about the effects of meadow degradation on soil BNF and diazotrophic communities in alpine meadows. Methods We investigated changes in soil BNF and their potential drivers in alpine meadows along a degradation gradient on the Tibetan Plateau (non-degraded, lightly degraded, moderately degraded, and severely degraded meadows) using real-time quantitative PCR and amplicon sequencing. Results Soil BNF rates decreased significantly along the meadow degradation gradient with a range of 17.34-79.84 nmol C2H4 g(-1) dry soil d(-1) across all sites. The highest BNF rate in the non-degraded meadow was 1.5-4.6-fold higher than that in the degraded meadows. The abundance and diversity of diazotrophs measured by nifH abundance and Shannon diversity was also decreased in the degraded meadows, accompanied by decreases in plant biomass, soil moisture, and nutrient content (C, N). Soil BNF rate was correlated with plant biomass, soil nutrient content, and diazotrophic abundance (including Nostoc, Scytonema, Rhodopseudomonas, and unidentified genera within the Rhizobiales and Proteobacteria). The community composition of diazotrophs differed markedly among sites with different levels of degradation, with both autotrophic (Cyanobacteria) and heterotrophic (Proteobacteria) diazotrophs contributing significantly to BNF. The plant functional groups, particularly the sedge family, were the primary drivers of soil BNF rates via mediating soil moisture, nutrient content (dissolved organic C and N), nifH gene abundance, and diazotrophic community composition. Conclusions Our results reveal the main drivers of decreased BNF during alpine meadow degradation and emphasize the importance of plant functional groups in shaping the diazotrophic community and regulating the BNF rate. This information can be applied to the restoration of degraded meadow ecosystems.

However, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the potential relationship between rhizosphere microbial diversity and soil multifunctionality during forest vegetation restoration. In this study, the diversity, assembly processes, and co-occurrence patterns of rhizosphere microbial communities were explored along a 45-year chronosequence of Robinia pseudoacacia plantations in China's Loess Plateau region. Soil multifunction index was calculated based on 11 measured available nutrient properties. The results showed that both alpha- and beta-diversities of rhizosphere microbial communities were significantly correlated with the soil multifunction index. Stochastic processes dominated rhizosphere microbial community assembly. Correlations between the abundances of sensitive operational taxonomic units for different forest ages (i.e. 15, 25, 35, and 45 years old) and soil multifunctional index varied in distinct network modules, being positive in module 1 and negative in module 2. There was a positive correlation between microbial network complexity (e.g. degree) and soil multifunctional index. The contribution of rhizosphere core microbiota to soil multifunctional index was higher than that of non-core microbiota. To sum up, plantation vegetation restoration enhances the relationship between microbial diversity and soil multifunctionality, while affecting microbial co-occurrence patterns in the rhizosphere.

However, the effect of the combination of PM and VRT (PMV) on soil water characteristics and crop production has not been investigated previously. A field experiment carried out from 2016 to 2018 using three treatments: VRT for 40 cm depth with PM (PMV); rotary tillage for 15 cm depth with PM (traditional tillage, TT); and rotary tillage for 15 cm depth without PM (CK). The results showed that PMV significantly decreased soil bulk density by 13.3-25.3 % and the soil wilting coefficient by 11.4-23.4 % in the 0-40 cm profile, resulting in significantly increased soil available water storage (SAWS), especially during the dry season (i.e. at the potato squaring stage) of the drought year (2016), when it increased by 12.4 % and 37.1 % during squaring stage compared with TT and CK, respectively. The increased SWAS benefited potato development in that the LAI of PMV increased by 9.7-37.1 % and 24.2-90.4 %, the aboveground biomass increased by 18.2-68.9 % and 64.0-133.4 % compared with TT and CK, respectively. The well-developed potato plants grown under PMV significantly increased evapotranspiration, tuber yield, and water use efficiency (WUE) by 27.5-47.8 %, 11.3-24.0 %, and 12.9-26.7 % compared with TT, and by 61.1-293.7 %, 1.0-27.4 %, and 59.3-207.5 % compared with CK. The highest increases in tuber yield and WUE under PMV were observed during the drought year (2016). These results suggest PMV as a promising method to solve seasonal drought stress and increase potato production in semiarid rain-fed areas mainly covered by loessial soils.																			0167-1987	1879-3444				MAY	2020	199								104591	10.1016/j.still.2020.104591	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2020.104591													WOS:000521110000014

FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL												The commercial quality of foxtail millet grain (Setaria italica L.) includes appearance quality, functional quality, and cooking and eating quality, which directly determine whether consumers will purchase the product. We studied the relationship between ecological factors and commercial quality attributes of foxtail millet "Jingu 21" from twelve production areas. The results showed that altitude, latitude, and diurnal temperature range were negatively correlated with b*, total flavones content (TFC), setback (SB), consistence (CS) and pasting temper-ature (PTM), but positively correlated with L/B and breakdown (BD). In contrast, average temperature, average precipitation, average humidity, available nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium had positive effects on 1,000 -grain weight (KGW), b*, TFC, CS, and PTM and had a negative impact on L/B and BD. Climate factors had a greater effect on the commercial quality of foxtail millet than soil factors, and the influence of climatic factors was particularly obvious in the early and middle growth periods. The multivariate equation between ecological factors and the comprehensive score of foxtail millet commercial quality is Y = 1,159.745-4.496X1 (altitude) + 19.529X5 (>= 10celcius effective accumulated temperature) -166.327X10 (organic matters). In conclusion, high temperature and precipitation are conducive to high quality appearance and the accumulation of functional substances, while a high diurnal temperature range and high soil nutrients are conducive to the formation of cooking and eating quality. The impact of ecological factors on foxtail millet quality is complicated and it is essential to select a cultivation site that is matched to the intended use of the foxtail millet being produced.																			0963-9969	1873-7145				JAN	2023	163								112225	10.1016/j.foodres.2022.112225	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2022.112225		NOV 2022						36596154					WOS:000896881200007

The climatic transition zone was a naturally ideal place to study. the relations between environmental factors and crop yield, due to its large annual variability of climatic factors and high speed of temperature increase under global warming. Our objectives were to identify the most critical environmental factor in determining spring wheat yield and analyze the convergence and divergence of water-yield relations for spring wheat in a typical climatic transition zone (semi-arid area). The study was conducted at two locations, Dingxi and Pengyang in Northwest China, with a long-term experiment (1987-2018) and two short-term irrigation experiments. Meanwhile, data of water use and spring wheat yield was collected from a series of previously published literature in the study area. The highest spring wheat yield was obtained under year pattern with higher soil water content at sowing (SWCS) and lower atmospheric dryness condition (ADC, the difference between reference evapotranspiration and precipitation during spring wheat growing season). SWCS was more important than precipitation during the growing season (PGS) in determining spring wheat yield in the study area. The relations between available water supply, water use, and spring wheat yield were convergence. However, SWCS had an impact on the relationship between yield and PGS and SWCS-yield relation was affected by ADC. We concluded that precipitation in 7 months before sowing was the dominant factor determining spring wheat yield in the climatic transition zone under global warming whereas the impact of high atmospheric evaporative demand resulted from the increasing temperature on crop yields and SWCS-yield relation must be taken into account for the analysis of environmental determination of spring wheat yield						Zhao, Funian/0000-0002-8407-4159													0020-7128	1432-1254				MAR	2022	66	3					481	491		10.1007/s00484-021-02196-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-021-02196-9		JAN 2022						35064318					WOS:000745406500001

Additive main effect and multiplicative interaction model and genotype main effects and genotype x environment interaction biplot are the two most popular methods in the analysis of genotype x environment interaction in multienvironment trials. We conducted an experiment designed to examine and evaluate the adaptability and stability of four agronomic traits of 19 tested maize genotypes in two consecutive growth cycles across seven provinces including 37 locations using a randomized completely block design with three replicates. The combined ANOVA for all traits showed that the effect of genotype, environment, and genotype x environment interaction were significant at 0.1% probability levels. In order to evaluate multiple agronomic traits more accurately, multitrait stability index (MTSI) as an emerging selection method based on mean performance and stability was adopted. Agronomic trait grain yield (GY) was positively correlated with grain weight per ear and growth period. In addition, it was also found that GY and bar tip length showed obvious negative correlation. The MTSI is very helpful for breeders who hope to select mean performance and stability based on a variety of agronomic traits because it provides a convenient selection process while taking into account the relevant results of the traits.

Results: This study determined the susceptibility of eggs, second-instar larvae of T. absoluta to commercial formulations of the entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) Beauveria bassiana and Lecanicillium muscarium at different doses (10(10), 10(9), 10(8), 10(7) and 10(6) spores/ml). Pathogenicity tests were carried out under controlled laboratory conditions at 27 +/- 1 degrees C, and RH of 75 +/- 5%, showed that the three commercial formulations of B. bassiana R444 (Bb-Protec (R)), B. bassiana ATCC 74,040 (Naturalis (R)) and L. muscarium Ve6 (Mycotal (R)) were effective against eggs and second instar larvae of T. absoluta. Mortality rates of eggs and larvae were high with increasing the concentrations of the fungi. B. bassiana ATCC 74,040 was the most effective one, with an egg mortality rate of (71.42%) and larval mortality was greater than (80%), at the highest concentration of 10(10) spores/ml. The lethal concentration required to kill 50% of eggs was 1.56 x 10(8), 1.73 x 10(9) and 1.09 x 10(10) conidia/ml for B. bassiana ATCC, B. bassiana R444, and L. muscarium, respectively. After 7 days, the median lethal concentration (LC50) values against larvae were the lowest for B. bassiana ATCC with 2.63 x 10(7) and 4.76 x 10(6) conidia/ml by way 1 and way 2 treatments, respectively. Thus, these three formulations affected the emergence of pest's adults. The fungi significantly reduced pupation and adult emergence. Only 50.25, 60.15 and 69.16% of T. absoluta adults emerged in the treatments with B. bassiana ATCC, B. bassiana R444, and L. muscarium, respectively. Conclusions: Biological performances of the EPF showed the role of a biological control agent that can be played against T.absoluta within the framework of an Integrated Pest Management program.

Myrmecochorous plants express specialized adaptations, most notably a large elaiosome, which promote interactions with efficient seed dispersers while decreasing interactions with poor dispersers, resulting in de facto partner choice. However, because variation in plants' investment in reward and ant response to them may vary spatially and temporally, it is unclear whether such specialization is consistent along geographic gradients; especially towards myrmecochory's range margin. To answer this question on context-dependent partner choice, we first estimated variation in reward investment by co-occurring myrmecochores along a steep environmental gradient in a Mediterranean region. Second, we tested whether variation in plant investment in reward was positively and consistently correlated with the quality of dispersal plant received along the same gradient. Using in situ cafeteria experiments, we simultaneously presented diaspores of locally co-occurring myrmecochorous species to ants of two guilds representing high-and low-quality dispersers. We then recorded ant-seed behaviour, seed preference and seed removal rates for each ant guild. We found both overall and within-site high variation among plant species in the total and relative investment in elaiosomes. Both ant guilds removed substantial proportion of the seeds. However, scavenging ants (high-quality dispersers) clearly preferred diaspores with larger elaiosomes, whereas granivorous ants (low-quality dispersers) exhibited no preference. Furthermore, both the variation in plant traits and the corresponding response of different ant guilds were consistent along the studied geographic gradient. This consistency holds even when granivores, which removed seeds in a non-selective fashion and provided apparently low-quality seed dispersal services, were, at least numerically, the dominant ant guild. This dominance and the consistency of the partner choice shed light on the functionality of elaiosomes at the margins of myrmecochory's distribution.

A change in land use from croplands to orchards inevitably influences the preexisting rainfall partitioning and soil water replenishment processes. However, few studies have focused on the differences in TF and SF and their effects on soil water replenishment after converting croplands into apple orchards. Thus, the objectives of this study were to quantify the differences in TF and SF between maize (Zea mays L.) and apple trees (Malus domestica, cv. Fuji), clarify their influencing factors, and compare the efficiency of soil water replenishment by rainfall from June to September as well as the soil water content and storage in each hydrological year of the study. Under the same rainfall conditions, the rainfall was distributed differently due to the presence of the maize and apple tree canopies. The sum of the TF and SF in the maize field (129.1 mm and 167.6 mm) was lower than that in the apple orchard (250.4 mm and 354.2 mm) in 2017 and 2018, respectively; the TF amount in the apple orchard was on average 3.4 times that in the maize field, while the SF amount in the maize field was on average 12.9 times that in the apple orchard. The TF percentage ranged from 0 to 76.9 % and 0 to 97.9 % for the maize field and the apple orchard, respectively, while the SF percentage ranged from 0 to 37.5 % and 0 to 3.3 %. The soil water input sources for the maize field were TF and SF, while the input source for the apple orchard was mainly TF. TF and SF production increased linearly with rainfall in the apple orchard. The rainfall amount was identified as the variable with the greatest influence on rainfall partitioning among the rainfall factors considered. An increasing leaf area index resulted in decreasing relative TF but increasing relative SF for maize and decreasing relative TF and SF for apple trees. The mean efficiency of the replenishment of soil water by rainfall in the maize field (30.8 % and 37.4 % in 2017 and 2018, respectively) was slightly lower than that in the apple orchard (34.4 % and 41.0 %). This study provides insight into water cycle analyses aimed at understanding rainfall partitioning and the soil water environment within croplands converted into apple orchards on the Loess Plateau and in other, similar regions.

To determine the effects of zinc (Zn) fertilizer on maize yield and water-use efficiency (WUE) under different soil water conditions, a field experiment was conducted using cultivar Zhengdan 958. The effects of Zn (0, 20, 50, and 80 kg ha(-1) ZnSO4) on maize transpiration, leaf relative water content (RWC), root morphological characteristics, root hydraulic conductance (RHC), yield and WUE under rainfed conditions (well-watered, WW) or rainout shelter conditions (drought stress, DS) were assessed. Compared with the zero-Zn controls under the respect water treatments, the chlorophyll content, stem sap flow rate (SFR) and RHC in response to Zn increased by 8%, 30% and 177%, respectively, at 20 kg ha(-1) of Zn under WW and 18%, 46% and 52%, respectively, at 50 kg ha(-1) under DS. Compared with those in the controls, leaf RWC in response to 50 kg ha(-1) Zn under DS and 20 kg ha(-1) under WW increased significantly. Zn fertilizer increased grain yield (GY) by 12.5% and 7.5% and WUE by 11% and 6.5% at 50 kg ha(-1) under DS and 20 kg ha(-1) under WW, respectively, relative to the controls without Zn. These results suggest that in the alkaline soil area of Loess Plateau, 50 kg ha(-1) Zn can effectively improve water absorption capacity of maize, thus increasing yield and WUE under DS, while 20 kg ha(-1) is sufficient under WW.

In this study, we analyzed the variations of runoff and sediment at the flood event scale in the Qiaogou catchment and investigated the influencing factors. The results showed that runoff and sediment of flood events were mainly produced by rainfall with short rainfall duration and heavy rainfall intensity in the study area. Based on the 28 flood events and corresponding precipitation data from the reference period (P-I, 1986-1989) and the revegetation period (P-II, 2001-2009), we analyzed the variations of runoff-sediment processes at the flood event scale in the Qiaogou catchment, a typical catchment of the Loess Plateau. The results showed that the flood variables were lower in the revegetation period than those in the reference period, except for the flood peak discharge time and the flood duration. The sediment transport capacity per unit runoff depth in the revegetation period was weaker than that in the reference period. The hysteresis analysis indicated that the patterns of the hysteretic loop were dominated by the figure-of-eight pattern and the compound pattern, respectively, in the reference period and revegetation period. Compared to the reference period, runoff and sediment-related variables for flood events of counter-clockwise, figure-of-eight, and compound patterns were less in the revegetation period. With similar rainfall conditions, the main reason for the noticeable difference in runoff and sediment of flood events for the two periods was the variations in vegetation cover. The mentioned results indicated that revegetation performed a critical function in the variations of runoff and sediment at the flood event scale. This study revealed the variations of runoff-sediment processes of flood events and their responses to rainfall and revegetation in a typical catchment of the Loess Plateau, which can provide a basis for decision-making on soil erosion management and sustainable development of the ecological environment in the Loess Plateau.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS												In order to evaluate the effects of bentazon and nicosulfuron on the photosynthetic apparatus of X. strumarium in greenhouse condition, chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlF) method was studied at 1, 2, 3, and 4 days after herbicide treatment (DAHT). Bentazon in comparison to nicosulfuron, dramatically affect ChlF parameters and the shape of polyphasic OJIP curves at 1 DAHT. Bentazon significantly decreased photosystem II activity via increasing minimum fluorescence (F-o) and maximum quantum yield of basal non-photochemical energy losses (F-o/FM) and decreasing maximum fluorescence (Fm), variable fluorescence (Fv), time to reach maximum fluorescence (Tfm), size of the plastoquinone pool on the reducing side of photosystem II (Area), maximum efficiency of water-splitting complex on the donor side of the photosystem II (Fv/F-o), maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), trapping flux leading to Q(A) reduction per RC (TRo/RC), electron transport flux further than Q(A)(-) per RC (ETo/RC), and electron flux reducing end electron acceptors at the photosystem I acceptor side per RC (REo/RC). In most cases, the inhibitory effects of bentazon on photosystem II activity were observed at 1 DAHT but, those inhibitory effects were delayed by nicosulfuron application. It was concluded that ChlF is a rapid method for studding herbicide mode of action as photosystem II activity considered primary sites of action in bentazon and secondary sites of action in nicosulfuron.																			2665-9727					JUN	2020	6								100026	10.1016/j.indic.2020.100026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indic.2020.100026													WOS:000646883600002
J	He, L; Jin, N; Yu, Q				He, Liang; Jin, Ning; Yu, Qiang			Impacts of climate change and crop management practices on soybean phenology changes in China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Crop phenology is determined by both climatic factors and agronomic management practices such as sowing date and cultivar characteristics. Exploring the interactive effects of climate change and crop management practices on crop phenology can be used to devise adaptation strategies to mitigate climate change. The objectives of this study were to: 1) examined trends in soybean (Glycine max L.) phenological development in China from 1981 to 2010; 2) isolate and quantify impacts of climate change and crop management on changes in soybean phenology; 3) determine the relative contribution of climate change and crop management to observed changes in soybean phenology; and 4) determine the relative contribution of temperature, precipitation, and sunshine hours to changes in soybean phenology. Changes in soybean phenology were observed across the major soybean producing area of eastern China during 1981-2010. Observed dates of sowing, emergence, anthesis, and maturity were delayed by an average of 1.78, 0.83, 0.19, and 0.62 days decade(-1), respectively. Additionally, the lengths of the vegetative growth period and the soybean growing season were shortened by an average of 0.62 and 1.16 days decade(-1), respectively. Conversely, the reproductive period was lengthened by an average of 0.43 days decade(-1). Crop management practices had greater influence on sowing, emergence, and maturity dates than climate change. The direction of the changes to phenology trends created by management and climate change were opposite to each other. The relative influence of climate change on dates of anthesis, lengths of the vegetative and reproductive growth periods and growing season was larger than the influence of crop management practices. Mean temperature was the dominant climatic factor influencing most soybean phenological stages and phases. Delayed sowing dates and use of longer-duration cultivars are management adaptations that farmers have used to adapt to climate change occurring in past decades and that can continue to be used. These results indicate that farmers have a wider sowing window in spring and can select cultivars with long growing season duration and frost-tolerance to mitigate detrimental effects of a future warmer climate.

Therefore, indirect measures that are related to reproduction are generally employed. In snakes, males typically possess longer tails than females and this sexual size dimorphism in tail length (TL) has generally been attributed to the importance of the tail in mating and reproduction. Thus, intra-sexual differences in tail length, specifically within males, were hypothesized to reflect individual quality. We used a body condition index (BCI) as a measure of quality in snakes and predicted that tail length would be correlated with BCI in males. We tested our prediction by determining BCI in the free-ranging adult male and female crowned leafnose snake (Lytorhynchus diadema), a colubrid species that inhabits mainly desert sand dunes. The relative TL was correlated positively and significantly to BCI in males (F-1,F-131 = 11.05; r(2) (adj) = 0.07; P < 0.01) but not in females, thus supporting our prediction. This is the first time that the relationship between TL and body condition was tested in a free-ranging species. In addition, sexual size dimorphism of TL increased intra-specifically with body size, which was also found in interspecific analyses following Rensch's rule.

Flag leaf vein traits and their correlation with photosynthesis and grain yield in wheat genotypes of differing ploidy	BIOLOGIA PLANTARUM												Leaf venation and coupled physiological function of wild plants co-evolve during the natural selection. How artificial selection affects leaf vein traits and coordinated physiological functions of main crops are largely unknown. This study examined the changes of leaf vein traits and their correlation with gas exchange of flag leaves and yield in eight wheat genotypes of differing ploidy under the same growing conditions. The results indicate that flag leaf vein density (VLA), major-vein density (VLA(major)), and minor-vein density (VLA(minor)) decreased whereas the proportion of minor-vein length and interveinal distance between small longitudinal veins (IVD) increased during the polyploidization process, and the major advance occurred from the period from diploids to tetraploids. The VLA, VLA(major), and VLA(minor) were closely coordinated with maximum net photosynthetic rate (P-N) and photosynthetic N use efficiency (PNUE), but not with stomatal conductance. The proportion of minor-vein length and IVD were negatively related with P-N and PNUE but positively related with N content per area (N-area) during wheat evolution. A higher proportion of minor-vein length and IVD, and a lower VLA(major) in flag leaves along with a larger N-area were largely responsible for the increased yield in modern cultivars. The decreased redundancy of leaf vein density and increased minor-vein proportion in modern cultivars can confer a yield advantage during wheat evolution.

Soil water and nutrient deficits hinder slope revegetation in arid and semi-arid areas. However, few studies have discussed rainfall runoff utilization and soil nutrient conservation within the context of slope vegetation restoration. In this study, the effects of combining infiltration holes and level ditches on the soil water storage, organic matter, and total nitrogen were analyzed on the slopes of shrubland and bare land. The results showed that the combined measures significantly increased the average soil water content above the 100 cm soil layer and mitigated soil desiccation below 220 cm in the shrubland. Meanwhile, the combined measures obviously increased the soil organic matter and total nitrogen above the 60 and 40 cm soil layers in bare land and shrubland, respectively. Overall, combining infiltration holes and landscape engineering measures is an effective approach for enhancing the soil water and nutrient pools of slopes. Our findings provide an effective engineering measure to combat soil water and nutrient deficits for slope vegetation restoration in arid and semi-arid areas. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

To understand the changes in root morphology in forage seedlings under drought stress, a nursery experiment was conducted with and without water stress using four Gramineae species (Bromus inermis, Agropyron mongolicum, Lolium perenne, and Bothriochloa ischaemum) and four Leguminosae species (Lespedeza bicolor, Medicago sativa, Astragalus adsurgens and Melilotus suaveolens). The forages were grown in rhizoboxes under drought stress (15% polyethylene glycol stress) and well-watered (85% of field capacity) conditions. The results showed that the root length, root area, and specific root length of the Gramineae species were higher than those of the Leguminosae species at the 30-60 cm soil depth. The fine roots of eight species in the 00.5 mm diameter class had the largest total root length and total root area, and the total root volume and root tips in the 0.51.0 mm diameter class were the highest. Based on the subordinate function method results, B. inermis had the highest comprehensive score, while M. suaveolens had the lowest. Our results implied that Gramineae seedlings distributed more roots than Leguminosae seedlings in the 30-60 cm soil layer under drought stress. Under drought stress, fine roots in the 00.5 mm and 0.51.0 mm diameter classes were the main organs sustaining the growth of the eight species when suffered drought stress. Among the eight species, B. inermis had the strongest drought tolerance and could act as an optimal ecological restoration forage in the semiarid region of northwest China.

LIFE ADAPTED TO PRECARIOUSNESS The ecology of drylands	METODE SCIENCE STUDIES JOURNAL												Drylands occupy approximately 40 % of the Earth's surface. Their peculiar hydrological system, with water as the main limiting factor, together with other characteristics such as the variability of rainfall and their ecological heterogeneity, make these regions one of the main and most relevant sets of biomes on the planet. Beyond their stereotypical conception as places with low economic and ecological profiles, these territories have enormous biodiversity and support 40 % of the world's population. Global warming is increasing atmospheric aridity, meaning that the strategies developed over millennia by the inhabitants of these areas represent a model we can learn from.

Conventional research methods had difficulties in accurately measuring water absorption soil profiles of grain crops under intercropping system. In this study, the seasonal variations in water uptake patterns of maize and soybean were identified using stable isotopes 818O and 82H in plant and soil water coupled with IsoSource model in monocrop and three intercropping modes: M2S2 (2 rows of maize and 2 rows of soybean), M2S4 (2 rows of maize and 4 rows of soybean), and M4S2 (4 rows of maize and 2 rows of soybean) on the Loess Plateau, China. The dominant water uptake depth of maize under monocrop contributed to 61.8 +/- 10.3% in 0-20 cm, 40.3 +/- 3.4% in 150-200 cm, and 65.3 +/- 11.6% in 20-70 cm soil profiles of the total water uptake at the jointing, silking, and maturity stages, respectively. The dominant water uptake depth of intercropped maize contribute to 46.1 +/- 1.1% in 0-20 cm, 31.8 +/- 0.8% in 70-150 cm, and 36.9 +/- 2.1% in 150-200 cm soil profiles of the total water uptake at the jointing, silking, and maturity stages, respectively. For soybean, the soil water at the 0-20 cm depth contributed 73.0 +/- 2.4% (monocrop) and 78.4 +/- 6.2% (intercrops) of the total water uptake across all three growth stages, respectively. Land equivalent ratio greater than one indicates yield advantages in intercropping systems compared to monocrop. Intercropped maize absorbed water from the soil layer deeper than that of soybean during the middle to late growth stages, indicating the intercropping advantages due to the differential water absorption depth. M4S2 mode had shallower main water absorption depth and higher water use efficiency than M2S2 and M2S4, respectively. The present study identified differential water absorption patterns between maize and soybean. The M4S2 intercrop mode was considered the optimal mode for rainfed intercropping systems due to its greater land and water use efficiency on the Loess Plateau.

This study investigates in detail the change and attribution of potential evapotranspiration (PET) across China from 1901 to 2100 by the Hargreaves model, based on a 1-km temperature dataset downscaled from the low-spatial-resolution datasets using a Delta downscaling framework. Results showed that (1) relative to 1961-1990, PET increased by 0.62% in the historic period (1901-2017) and 6.43-12.89% for the future period (2018-2100), suggesting considerable future drying for China. Moreover, these increments had strong spatial variations and the largest increases were detected in high-elevation regions; (2) PET over entire China demonstrated a nonsignificant upward trend during the historic period and significant upward trends for the future period. For each period and GCM, significant upward PET trends occupied a much larger percent area than significant downward trends; (3) PET variations during the historic period were most sensitive to mean temperature (TMP), while in the future period it was more sensitive to maximum temperature (TMX), suggesting a change in the primary sensitivity factor due to global warming; (4) minimum temperature (TMN) made the largest contribution (45%) to PET variations during the historic period, while TMX had the largest contribution (36-40%) in the future period. Therefore, the primary contributing factor might transform from TMN to TMX under climate change; and (5) PET variations exhibited strong spatial heterogeneity, detected on fine geographic scales, due to the use of downscaled dataset. Overall, the results present a deep insight for planning coping strategies of global warming in China.

Plant species and community stoichiometric N/P homeostasis can impact plant species and community stability, respectively, in response to variations of soil N and P availabilities. We investigated interspecific plant interactions via AMF in regard to plant and soil microbial N/P stoichiometry across different soil N and P availabilities induced by N and P addition (0 mg N kg(-1), 25 mg N kg(-1), 50 mg N kg(-1), 30 mg P kg(-1) and 100 mg P kg(-1)). We selected one dominant (Bothriochloa ischaemum; C4 grass) and one subordinate (Lespedeza davurica; legume) species in a natural grassland climax community. We examined how AMF influences stoichiometric N/P homeostasis in monoculture and mixed culture systems, and the resulting consequences for temporal stability of plant species and community in response to variations in soil N and P availability.The AMF mitigated the P limitation of soil microbial communities and decreased the degree of stoichiometric N/P homeostasis of host plants in monoculture. Through their resource-scavenging and soil organic matter mineralisation functions, AMF enhances plant 'luxury consumption', promoting species stability in monoculture in response to soil N and P availability variations. Compared with plants in monoculture, the interaction between B. ischaemum and L. davurica via AMF increased shoot N/P under soil N-poor conditions, leading to an enhanced degree of stoichiometric N/P homeostasis in both plant species, especially the legume.Our results suggest that interspecific plant interaction between C4 grass and legume mediated by AMF confers an advantage in complementarity in plant N acquisition under N-poor conditions, leading to increased stability of plant communities and better maintenance of subordinate species (legume) in response to soil N deficiency.

Based on the measured runoff data of 62 hydrological stations in the Weihe River Basin (WRB) from 2006 to 2018, we analyzed the temporal and spatial runoff characteristics in this study. Correlation analysis was used to investigate the relationships between different runoff indicators and climate-related factors. Additionally, an improved Budyko framework was applied to assess the sensitivities of annual runoff to precipitation, potential evaporation, and other factors. The results showed that the daily runoff flow duration curves (FDCs) of all selected hydrological stations fall in three narrow ranges, with the corresponding mean annual runoff spanning approximately 1.50 orders of magnitude, indicating that the runoff of different hydrological stations in the WRB varied greatly. The trend analysis of runoff under different exceedance frequencies showed that the runoff from the south bank of the Weihe River was more affluent and stable than that from the north bank. The runoff was unevenly distributed throughout the year, mainly in the flood season, accounting for more than 50.00% of the annual runoff. However, the trend of annual runoff change was not obvious in most areas. Correlation analysis showed that rare-frequency runoff events were more susceptible to climate factors. In this study, daily runoff under 10%-20% exceeding frequencies, consecutive maximum daily runoff, and low-runoff variability rate had strong correlations with precipitation, aridity index, and average runoff depth on rainy days. In comparison, daily runoff under 50%-99% exceeding frequencies, consecutive minimum daily runoff, and high-runoff variability rate had weak correlations with all selected impact factors. The sensitivity analysis results suggested that the sensitivity of annual runoff to precipitation was always higher than that to potential evaporation. The runoff about 87.10% of the selected hydrological stations were most sensitive to precipitation changes, and 12.90% were most sensitive to other factors. The spatial pattern of the sensitivity analysis indicated that in relatively humid southern areas, runoff was more sensitive to potential evaporation and other factors, and less sensitive to precipitation.																			1674-6767	2194-7783				DEC	2022	14	12					1344	1360		10.1007/s40333-022-0109-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-022-0109-6													WOS:000901996100002

Although the function of calcium (Ca) has been widely studied in plants, it remains to be explored whether regulation of nitrate uptake and reduction is needed. A hydroponics experiment on adzuki beans (Vigna angularis Willd.) was used as a test material to determine the interactions between Ca and three levels of nitrogen supply. The height of the plant, the leaf area per plant, the biomass of the plant, the morphology of the roots, the hydraulic conductivity of the roots, the level of gas exchange, and the level of N metabolism of the adzuki beans were evaluated. Furthermore, RT-qPCR was conducted to explore the expression of genes related to nitrate transporter responses to Ca under N -limitation stress conditions. The rate of accumulation of N in plant tissue increased with the application of Ca. However, plant biomass, photosynthetic parameters, and root activity peaked for Ca2+ supply under N-marginal conditions. Further investigation revealed that the activities of nitrate reductase and glutamine synthetase were relatively high. The transcription of the nitrate transporter (VaNRT1.1; VaNRT2.5) was up-regulated in the roots of the Ca-treated plants. Both N-marginal conditions and N deficiency inhibit N absorption and utilization. The favorable effects of Ca on seedling growth and N metabolism under N-marginal conditions were more significant than those under N-deficiency conditions. The supply of Ca2+ is optimal, as it increases NUE by enhancing photosynthesis, N-metabolizing enzyme activities, and NO3 uptake and transport under N-marginal conditions.																			0981-9428	1873-2690				NOV 1	2022	190						90	100		10.1016/j.plaphy.2022.08.028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2022.08.028		SEP 2022						36108356					WOS:000883221100002

Most researches focus on the response of community composition, which is based on the presence/absence or relative abundances of different species. However, the response of species-identity-independent community structure, such as the rank-abundance distribution, remains relatively understudied. We conducted a tenyear nitrogen addition experiment in a temperate steppe, with nine nitrogen rates under fencing (un-mowed) or mowing conditions. Mowing and nitrogen addition significantly altered both the composition and structure of plant communities. While the relative importance of stochastic change in community composition under mowing was not significantly different from that under fencing, the relative importance of stochastic change in community structure under mowing was significantly larger than that under fencing. Overall, our results demonstrated that mowing led to different drivers for the community composition and structure, meaning that mowing promoted the stochastic allocation of material and energy in primary producers in the grassland ecosystem.

Finding a Home: Stopping Theory and Its Application to Home Range Establishment in a Novel Environment	FRONTIERS IN CONSERVATION SCIENCE												Familiarity with the landscape increases foraging efficiency and safety. Thus, when animals are confronted with a novel environment, either by natural dispersal or translocation, establishing a home range becomes a priority. While the search for a home range carries a cost of functioning in an unfamiliar environment, ceasing the search carries a cost of missed opportunities. Thus, when to establish a home range is essentially a weighted sum of a two-criteria cost-minimization problem. The process is predominantly heuristic, where the animal must decide how to study the environment and, consequently, when to stop searching and establish a home range in a manner that will reduce the cost and maximize or at least satisfice its fitness. These issues fall within the framework of optimal stopping theory. In this paper we review stopping theory and three stopping rules relevant to home range establishment: the best-of-n rule, the threshold rule, and the comparative Bayes rule. We then describe how these rules can be distinguished from movement data, hypothesize when each rule should be practiced, and speculate what and how environmental factors and animal attributes affect the stopping time. We provide a set of stopping-theory-related predictions that are testable within the context of translocation projects and discuss some management implications.																				2673-611X				OCT 18	2021	2								714580	10.3389/fcosc.2021.714580	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcosc.2021.714580													WOS:001003160200001
J	Zeng, QC; An, SS				Zeng, Quanchao; An, Shaoshan			Identifying the Biogeographic Patterns of Rare and Abundant Bacterial Communities Using Different Primer Sets on the Loess Plateau	MICROORGANISMS												High-throughput sequencing is commonly used to study soil microbial communities. However, different primers targeting different 16S rRNA hypervariable regions often generate different microbial communities and result in different values of diversity and community structure. This study determined the consequences of using two bacterial primers (338f/806r, targeting the V3-V4 region, and 520f/802r, targeting the V4 region) to assess bacterial communities in the soils of different land uses along a latitudinal gradient. The results showed that the variations in the soil bacterial diversity in different land uses were more evident based on the former pair. The statistical results showed that land use had no significant impact on soil bacterial diversity when primer pair 520f/802r was used. In contrast, when primer pair 338f/806r was used, the cropland and orchard soils had significantly higher operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and Shannon diversity index values than those of the shrubland and grassland soils. Similarly, the soil bacterial diversity generated by primer pair 338f/806r was significantly impacted by mean annual precipitation, soil total phosphorus (TP), soil total nitrogen (TN), and soil available phosphorus (AVP), while the soil bacterial diversity generated by primer pair 520f/802r showed no significant correlations with most of these environmental factors. Multiple regression models indicated that soil pH and soil organic carbon (SOC) shaped the soil bacterial community structure on the Loess Plateau regardless of what primer pair was used. Climatic conditions mainly affected the diversity of rare bacteria. Abundant bacteria are more sensitive than rare bacteria to environmental changes. Very little of the variation in the rare bacterial community was explained by environmental factors or geographic distance, suggesting that the communities of rare bacteria are unpredictable. The distributions of the abundant taxa were mainly determined by variations in environmental factors.						quanchao, zeng/0000-0003-1272-0227														2076-2607				JAN	2021	9	1							139	10.3390/microorganisms9010139	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9010139								33435426					WOS:000610586800001

The microbial nitrogen mineralization (MNM) within deep soils, particularly in regions with intensive agricultural activities and thick soil horizons, has been largely disregarded. As such, this study aims to address this knowledge gap by investigating the chiA-harboring microbial structure and network within nine 10-m profiles beneath cultivated farmland and two apple orchards. The results showed that apple orchards, compared to farmland, had considerable water deficit and nitrogen accumulation within deeper soil layers due to well-developed root systems and the overuse of chemical fertilizers. However, the chiA- harboring microbial diversity, composition, and abundance all exhibited significant variations with soil depths rather than being influenced by different land use types. Moreover, the diversity indices and gene abundances decreased with soil depths, and the related soil microbes included 19 phyla, 29 classes, 72 orders, 114 families, and 197 genera, with Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria being the two major bacterial phyla. The microbial co-occurrence network was simper beneath apple orchards. The chiA-harboring microorganisms within deep un-saturated zones were greatly influenced by the depth-dependent soil nutrients, such as total nitrogen, organic carbon, and available potassium. The limited plant root biomass and the inhibitory effects of dried soil layers both restricted the availability of carbon sources, which further interfered with the MNM processes within deep soils insignificantly. Therefore, despite the considerable plant-induced ecohydrological consequences, the depth -dependent MNM processes were slightly affected after the transformation from farmland to apple orchards within thick loess deposits. This study offers crucial insights into microbial dynamics of the deep biosphere, thereby contributing to our understanding of depth-dependent biogeochemical cycles within global deep un-saturated zones.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				JAN 15	2024	908								168268	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168268	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168268		NOV 2023						37918737					WOS:001112196500001

The overexpression of dehydration-responsive element binding proteins/C-repeat-binding factor (DREB1A/CBF3) was previously reported to significantly increase the drought tolerance in transgenic potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), but its molecular mechanism is poorly understood. In the present study, potato cultivar Longshu No. 3 (NT) and its derived transgenic plants (T) with the Arabidopsis DREB1A gene driven by stress-inducible promoter rd29A were used as materials to study drought-stress responses of AtDREB1A in transgenic potato. The results showed, under drought stress, that the AtDREB1A gene was overexpressed in T and T presented a healthier phenotype, higher biomass, higher content of proline and lower content of malondialdehyde than the control NT, indicating that AtDREB1A overexpression improved potato drought tolerance. As the main organ of absorbing and transporting water and nutrients in soil, roots are the first to feel the stress of drought stress. Transcriptome analysis of roots showed that compared with control NT, a total of 533 annotated genes with at least two-fold changes were found to be differentially expressed in transgenic potato roots, comprising 262 up-regulated and 271 down-regulated genes. Among them, the expression of a large number of genes related to abscisic acid metabolism, receptor-like protein kinases, cytochrome P450, the glycosyl hydrolase family, peroxidase, F-box proteins and the heat shock protein family changed greatly, indicating that these genes were responsive to AtDREB1A expression and play important roles in improving drought tolerance of AtDREB1A transgenic potato. This study lays a foundation for further understanding the regulatory network of AtDREB1A gene in improving drought tolerance in potato.																			0014-3065	1871-4528				DEC	2023	66	4			SI		1143	1164		10.1007/s11540-023-09619-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11540-023-09619-7		FEB 2023											WOS:000935353700001

The studied onions showed a great diversity on biochemical contents and composition. It seemed that there were differences between genotype categories (local landraces or local breeding lines) and within the same category. Quercetin and quinic acid were, respectively, the main flavonoid (flavonol) and organic acid (cyclitol) identified and quantified by HPLC. In all studied onions, quercetin was the predominant flavonoid, with the highest content in the local breeding line OP2-w (1142.19 mg 100 g-1 DW). OP3-w showed the highest value of total phenolic as well as total flavonoid content at 12.52 mg GAE g(-1) DW and 48.28 RE g(-1) DW respectively. Fructose and sucrose were the most abundant sugars in all the genotypes. Clustering and PCA analysis showed a great dispersion of these genotypes which were classified into 3 major groups. The chemical and nutritional composition found highlights the great value of this onion germplasm which can be used for the sustainable conservation and management of Tunisian onion genetic resources.

However, their role in drought stress has not been investigated in bread wheat. In this study, the TaMYBsm3 genes, including TaMYBsm3-A, TaMYBsm3-B, and TaMYBsm3-D, encoding MYB-CC TF proteins in bread wheat, were isolated to investigate the possible molecular mechanisms related to drought-tolerance in plants. Results: TaMYBsm3-A, TaMYBsm3-B, and TaMYBsm3-D were mapped on chromosomes 6A, 6B, and 6D in wheat, respectively. TaMYBsm3 genes belonged to MYB-CC TFs, containing a conserved MYB DNA-binding domain and a conserved coiled-coil domain. TaMYBsm3-D was localized in the nucleus, and the N-terminal region was a transcriptional activation domain. TaMYBsm3 genes were ubiquitously expressed in different tissues of wheat, and especially highly expressed in the stamen and pistil. Under drought stress, transgenic plants exhibited milder wilting symptoms, higher germination rates, higher proline content, and lower MDA content comparing with the wild type plants. P5CS1, DREB2A, and RD29A had significantly higher expression in transgenic plants than in wild type plants. Conclusion: TaMYBsm3-A, TaMYBsm3-B, and TaMYBsm3-D were associated with enhanced drought tolerance in bread wheat. Overexpression of TaMYBsm3-D increases the drought tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis through up-regulating P5CS1, DREB2A, and RD29A.																			1471-2229					APR 15	2019	19								143	10.1186/s12870-019-1751-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-019-1751-9								30987595					WOS:000464868700004

This study used trend analysis to examine the spatial and temporal changes in the vegetation in East Africa, and then used coefficient of variation method and partial correlation analysis to investigate the effects of climate change and human activity on regional vegetation changes. The findings indicated that vegetation in East Africa exhibited an increasing spatial trend from north to south and that NDVI changes from 2001 to 2021 generally showed a weak upwards trend; however, 2005 was a significant year in the NDVI time series, and the NDVI fluctuations increased. Whereas the surface temperature showed varying degrees of the opposite tendency during the 21 years, the changes in vegetation and precipitation in East Africa were essentially coordinated, both indicating a fluctuating increasing trend. In East Africa, both surface mean temperature and precipitation had a significant impact on the NDVI, with precipitation having a marginally stronger impact than surface mean temperature. The partial correlations between the NDVI and surface temperature and precipitation were strongest in the RS2 (October to December) and DS1 (January to February) seasons, respectively. The results of the study provide a valuable reference for the future development of vegetation in East Africa.																			1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2023	82	10							249	10.1007/s12665-023-10933-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-023-10933-z													WOS:000983683100001

We investigated how C and N fluxes changed during the decomposition of leguminous and non-leguminous leaf litters, and how these processes responded to different precipitation regimes. We used the dual-isotope tracing method to investigate differences in leaf and soil C and N, along with d(13)C and d(15)N, in the soil of the Loess Plateau in China. The d(15)N and d(13C) values were 3604%o and 56%o for Robinia pseudoacacia (Leguminosae) and 8115%o and 452%o for Populus tomentosa (Salicaceae) leaf litters. Through decomposition, d(13)C decreased in all litters, and d(15)N in the leguminous litter increased while it decreased in the non-leguminous litter. In the surface soil, the fraction of litter derived N (14%) from the leguminous litter was significantly higher than that of the non-leguminous litter after 16 months. The C and N concentrations of both litters and soil always had a positive correlation during decomposition, and the responses of N to C changes in soil were reduced by the litter cover. Increased precipitation enhanced the litters' C and N correlation. The 600 mm precipitation treatment most benefited litter C's transformation to SOC, and drought conditions promoted the transformation of legume litter N to soil TN, but inhibited non-legume litter N. In the soil and both litters, C and N changes always had a positive correlation. After 16 months, the proportion of soil N from legumes was higher than that from non-legumes. Reduced precipitation could promote leguminous N in soil. Our results provide a scientific basis for accurately predicting the C and N cycles in terrestrial ecosystems.																				2073-4395				APR 24	2023	13	5							1205	10.3390/agronomy13051205	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13051205													WOS:000995221800001

As the fertigated area of wheat and maize in the NCP has grown rapidly during recent years, developing N management strategies is required for sustainable wheat and maize production. Field experiments were conducted in Hebei Province during three consecutive growth seasons in 2012-2015 to assess the influence of different N fertigation rates on N uptake, yield, and nitrogen use efficiency [NUE: recovery efficiency (REN) and agronomic efficiency (AE(N))]. Five levels of N application, 0 (FN0), 40 (FN40%), 70 (FN70%), 100 (FN100%), and 130% (FN130%) of the farmer practice rate (FP: 250 kg N ha(-1) and 205.5 kg N ha(-1) for wheat and maize, respectively), corresponding to 0, 182.2, 318.9, 455.5, and 592.2 kg N ha(-1) y(-1), respectively, were tested. Nitrogen in the form of urea was dissolved in irrigation water and split into six and four applications for wheat and maize, respectively. In addition, the treatment "drip irrigation + 100% N conventional broadcasting" (DN100%) was also conducted. All treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The results revealed the significant influence of both N fertigation rate and N application method on grain yield and NUE. Compared to DN100%, FN100% significantly increased the 3-year averaged N recovery efficiency (REN) by 0.09 kg kg(-1) and 0.04 kg kg(-1), and the 3-year averaged N agronomic efficiency (AE(N)) by 2.43 kg kg(-1) and 1.62 kg kg(-1) for wheat and maize, respectively. Among N fertigation rates, there was no significant increase in grain yield in response to N applied at a greater rate than 70% of FP due to excess N accumulation in vegetative tissues. Compared to FN70%, FN100%, and FN130%, FN40% increased the REN by 0.17-0.57 kg kg(-1) and 0.03-0.34 kg kg(-1)and the AE(N) by 4.60-27.56 kg kg(-1) and 2.40-10.62 kg kg(-1) for wheat and maize, respectively. Based on a linear-response relationship between the N fertigation rate and grain yield over three rotational periods it can be concluded that recommended N rates under drip fertigation with optimum split applications can be reduced to 46% (114.6 kg N ha(-1)) and 58% (116.6 kg N ha(-1)) of FP for wheat and maize, respectively, without negatively affecting grain yield, thereby increasing NUE.						hao, weiping/0000-0003-1102-9119													1436-8730	1522-2624				JUN	2019	182	3					335	346		10.1002/jpln.201700414	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.201700414													WOS:000473063400002

Improved legume pastures increase economic value, resilience and sustainability of crop-livestock systems	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												CONTEXT: Well-managed legume pastures play a crucial role in agricultural systems, contributing to strategies for the increasingly complex challenges of supplying meat and wool, improving soil fertility, increasing land use efficiency while minimising environmental impacts, and building system resilience.OBJECTIVE: This paper examines the potential for a range of improved annual legume pasture species to deliver multiple benefits such as extending the length of the growing the season and closing feed gaps, boosting crop yields and farm profits, and contributing to natural resource management.METHODS: Using MIDAS, a bioeconomic model of a crop-livestock farming system, we quantified the relative profitability and sustainability of five self-regenerating legume pasture scenarios -burr medic (Medicago poly-morpha L.), bladder clover (Trifolium spumosum L.), French serradella (Ornithopus sativus L.), biserrula (Biserrula pelecinus L.) and common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) -against the baseline scenario of (mainly) subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) for the medium-rainfall region of Western Australia. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The modelling indicated that profit gains of more than 25% were possible by using an improved self-regenerating legume option when compared to a subterranean clover-based pasture system. This could be achieved through greater utilisation of land under pastures and higher stocking rates while still maintaining a major cropping program. The whole-farm economic benefits of improved legume pastures resulted from land use adjustments to sustain more profitable cropping and livestock enterprises, and benefits were small at low stocking rates. The combination of additional feed at the start of the season and slower loss of energy values at the end of the season in the improved pasture scenarios was an important profit driver for the livestock enterprise. Other benefits included projected savings in nitrogen fertiliser for crops in rotation with the pasture, greater sheep carrying capacity, improved efficiencies in supplementary feed and labour costs per an-imal, lower groundwater recharge, and improved farm business resilience overall. Pastures with higher nutri-tional value could lead to reduced net emissions per DSE if they allow ruminants to reach finishing weight faster or improve reproductive efficiency. SIGNIFICANCE: This whole-farm study expands previous work by comparing a broad range of annual legume pasture species developed for the soils and climatic conditions of Western Australia. The general principles behind changes in land use revealed by the MIDAS modelling have wide application beyond this Australian region, confirming the potential role of well-managed legume pastures for achieving sustainable intensification of agricultural systems, while offering sufficient flexibility for grazing systems to cope with climate variability.

Although sediments may be completely controlled by well-developed biocrusts, runoff loss is observed. Consequently, it is important to study how biocrusts resist runoff erosion in different developmental stages to evaluate and manage water erosion. Materials and methods In the Loess Plateau Region, we sampled 32 biocrust plots representing eight stages of biocrust development and 5 slope cropland soil plots as bare soil control plots. We then used a rectangular open channel hydraulic flume to test the effects of biocrust development on runoff erosion. Results and discussion As expected, the establishment of biocrusts enhanced soil stability, and accordingly, soil anti-scourability significantly increased with biocrust development. Biocrusts exhibiting more than 36% or 1.22 g dm(-2) of moss coverage or biomass fully protected the soil from runoff erosion. Moreover, soil properties, such as soil organic matter, soil cohesion and soil bulk density, were also important in reducing erosion. The findings indicated that biocrusts inhibited runoff erosion through direct physical protection related to biocrust cover and biomass and through the indirect modification of soil properties. In the early biocrust development stage (when moss cover was less than 36%), cyanobacterial biocrust played a primary role in providing resistance to runoff erosion, with resistance being positively related to cyanobacterial biomass (chlorophyll a) and influenced by soil properties. Conclusions The relationship between soil anti-scourability and moss coverage or biomass can be divided into two stages based on a moss cover or biomass threshold. The capacity of biocrusts to resist runoff erosion was limited when moss cover was below the threshold value. Therefore, the stage corresponding to this level of moss cover should be of concern when estimating, predicting and managing water erosion.

Biocrusts are spatially variable, and the variability in biocrust composition and coverage is scale-dependent. The following question can then be asked: What is the appropriate spatial scale for observing ecological functions? Without clarifying this issue, we cannot fully understand the ecological functions of biocrusts. The key to answering this question is to determine a threshold area, or representative elementary area (REA). Accordingly, we analyzed red-green-blue (RGB) images of 90 biocrust plots (2.0 m x 2.0 m) from nine revegetated grasslands in the Hilly Loess Plateau region of China. The variability in biocrust composition and coverage across the plot sizes was studied by gradually expanding the plot size from 0.01 m(2) to 4.00 m(2). The results showed that as the plot sizes increased from 0.01 m(2) to 4.00 m(2), the number of biocrust types logarithmically increased. Biocrust patches of a particular type (such as moss, cyanobacteria or lichen) were often characteristic of a plot size of 0.01 m(2), whereas plot sizes larger than 0.25 m(2) supported mixed biocrusts of multiple patch types. The variability in coverage of mixed biocrusts logarithmically decreased with increasing plot sizes. The coverage of mixed biocrusts maintained an approximately constant value after a certain critical plot size was reached (1.00 m(2 )in this study). Our data indicated that REAs of mixed biocrusts exist at the slope scale. The REAs of mixed biocrusts were 0.5-1.0 m(2), 1.5-2.5 m(2) and 3.0-3.8 m(2), with alpha (alpha) values of 0.1, 0.05 and 0.01, respectively. The size of the REAs on the north-facing slope was larger than that on the south-facing slope, and the patch density of biocrusts had an important influence on the REAs. The results of this study could provide a method for determining the REAs of mixed biocrusts and guide surveys and experimental layouts.					shanshan, Wang/D-4444-2012	shanshan, Wang/0000-0002-6922-1640													0016-7061	1872-6259				JAN 15	2022	406								115502	10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115502	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115502		OCT 2021											WOS:000708893700002

Genotype-by-environment interactions for starch, mineral, and agronomic traits in pearl millet hybrids evaluated across five locations in West Africa	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												IntroductionPearl millet is a staple cereal grown in the harshest environments of arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. It is the primary source of calories for millions of people in these regions because it has better adaptation to harsh environmental conditions and better nutritional traits than many other cereals. By screening the pearl millet inbred germplasm association panel (PMiGAP), we earlier reported the best genotypes with the highest concentration of slowly digestible and resistant starch in their grains. MethodsIn the current study, we tested these 20 top-performing pearl millet hybrids, identified based on starch data, in a randomised block design with three replications at five locations in West Africa, viz. Sadore and Konni (Niger), Bambey (Senegal), Kano (Nigeria), and Bawku (Ghana). Phenotypic variability was assessed for agronomic traits and mineral traits (Fe and Zn). Results and discussionAnalysis of variance demonstrated significant genotypic, environmental, and GEI effects among five testing environments for agronomic traits (days to 50% flowering, panicle length, and grain yield), starch traits (rapidly digestible starch, slowly digestible starch, resistant starch, and total starch), and mineral trait (iron and zinc). Starch traits, such as rapidly digestible starch (RDS) and slowly digestible starch (SDS), showed nonsignificant genotypic and environmental interactions but high heritability, indicating the lower environmental influence on these traits in the genotype x testing environments. Genotype stability and mean performance across all the traits were estimated by calculating the multi-trait stability index (MTSI), which showed that genotypes G3 (ICMX207070), G8 (ICMX207160), and G13 (ICMX207184) were the best performing and most stable among the five test environments.

Foxtail millet (Setaria italica) is a natural stress-resistant plant and an ideal model for studying plant drought resistance. In this study, two varieties of foxtail millet with different levels of drought resistance were used as the experimental material. The soil weighing method was used to simulate drought stress, and the differences in growth, photosynthetic physiology, metabolite metabolism, and gene transcriptional expression under drought stress were compared and analyzed. We aimed to determine the physiological and key metabolic regulation pathways of the drought-tolerant millet in resistance to drought stress. The results showed that drought-tolerant millet exhibited relatively stable growth and photosynthetic parameters under drought stress while maintaining a relatively stable level of photosynthetic pigments. The metabolomic, transcriptomic, and gene co-expression network analysis confirmed that the key to adaptation to drought by millet was to enhance lignin metabolism, promote the metabolism of fatty acids to be transformed into cutin and wax, and improve ascorbic acid circulation. These findings provided new insights into the metabolic regulatory network of millet adaptation to drought stress.																			0031-9317	1399-3054				NOV	2023	175	6							e14122	10.1111/ppl.14122	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.14122								38148213					WOS:001126377700001

However, little attention has been devoted to the regulation of H2S on nutrient transport and utilization in legume-rhizobia symbiosis systems. Although we have previously proven that H2S synergized with rhizobia to considerably enhance nitrogen (N) metabolism and remobilization in N-deficient soybeans, it remains uncertain if changes in nutrient absorption, metabolism, and accumulation occur concurrently. Therefore, employing a synergistic treatment of H2S and rhizobia, we examined the dry matter biomass and carbon (C), N, phosphorous (P), and potassium (K) nutrient content in various organs of soybean from blooming to maturity. Firstly, H2S and rhizobia application obviously improved leaf and plant phenotypes and biomass accumulation in different organs during N-deficient soybean development. Second, from flowering to maturity, the contents and stoichiometric ratios of C, N, P, and K in various organs of soybean were changed to variable degrees by H2S and rhizobia. Furthermore, H2S collaborated with rhizobia to significantly affect grain nutrient harvest across soybean growth as well as overall plant nutrient accumulation. Consequently, H2S synergizes with rhizobia to optimize grain harvest quality and nutrient accumulation across the plant by managing the rational allocation and dynamic balance of nutrients in diverse organs, hence boosting soybean development and production.																				2073-4395				MAY 10	2023	13	5							1332	10.3390/agronomy13051332	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13051332													WOS:000994151400001

A three-year field experiment was conducted with three sowing dates (20 September (SD1), 1 October (SD2), and 10 October (SD3)) and three seeding rates (SR67.5, SR90, and SR112.5) to determine suitable sowing date and seeding rate for high wheat yield. A large seasonal variation in accumulated temperature from sowing to winter dormancy was observed among three growing seasons. Suitable sowing dates for strong seedlings before winter varied with the seasons, that was SD2 in 2012-2013, SD3 in 2013-2014, and SD2 as well as SD1 in 2014-2015. Seasonal variation in precipitation during summer fallow also had substantial effects on soil water storage, and consequently influenced grain yield through soil water consumption from winter dormancy to maturity stages. Lower consumption of soil water from winter dormancy to booting stages could make more water available for productive growth from anthesis to maturity stages, leading to higher grain yield. SD2 combined with SR90 had the lowest soil water consumption from winter dormancy to booting stages in 2012-2013 and 2014-2015; while in 2013-2014, it was close to that with SR67.5 or SR112.5. For productive growth from anthesis to maturity stages, SD2 with SR90 had the highest soil water consumption in all three seasons. The highest water consumption in the productive growth period resulted in the best grain yield in both low and high rainfall years. Ear number largely contributed to the seasonal variation in grain yield, while grain number per ear and 1000-grain weight also contributed to grain yield, especially when soil water storage was high. Our results indicate that sowing date and seeding rate affect grain yield through seedling development before winter and also affect soil water consumption in different growth periods. By selecting the suitable sowing date (1 October) in combination with the proper seeding rate of 90 kg ha(-1), the best yield was achieved. Based on these results, we recommend that the current sowing date be delayed from 22 or 23 September to 1 October.																			2095-3119					JAN	2019	18	1					33	42		10.1016/S2095-3119(18)61980-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(18)61980-X													WOS:000454955200004

Present trials were undertaken to study the effect of AMF on the ameliorating of salt, drought, and cold stress in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) plants. A new product of AMF combined with Rhizophagus irregularis SA, Rhizophagus clarus BEG142, Glomus lamellosum ON393, and Funneliformis mosseae BEG95 (1: 1: 1: 1, w/w/w/w) was inoculated with peanut and the physiological and metabolomic responses of the AMF-inoculated and non-inoculated peanut plants to salt, drought, and cold stress were comprehensively characterized, respectively.ResultsAMF-inoculated plants exhibited higher plant growth, leaf relative water content (RWC), net photosynthetic rate, maximal photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) (Fv/Fm), activities of antioxidant enzymes, and K+: Na+ ratio while lower leaf relative electrolyte conductivity (REC), concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA), and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under stressful conditions. Moreover, the structures of chloroplast thylakoids and mitochondria in AMF-inoculated plants were less damaged by these stresses. Non-targeted metabolomics indicated that AMF altered numerous pathways associated with organic acids and amino acid metabolisms in peanut roots under both normal-growth and stressful conditions, which were further improved by the osmolytes accumulation data.ConclusionThis study provides a promising AMF product and demonstrates that this AMF combination could enhance peanut salt, drought, and cold stress tolerance through improving plant growth, protecting photosystem, enhancing antioxidant system, and regulating osmotic adjustment.

Straw mulching in the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) fallow season can improve the soil water content. It is unclear whether green manure can be planted in addition to straw mulching to improve the soil water content and quality. Therefore, a field experiment was conducted in the semiarid area of the Loess Plateau in China from 2009 to 2017 with the following treatments; (1) traditional bare land in fallow season after plowing (CK), (2) no-tillage with straw mulching (NTSM), (3) and no-tillage with straw mulching and planting soybean as green manure (NTSGM). We determined the effects of these three treatments on the soil water, nutrients, and wheat productivity. Compared with CK, the average soil water contents in 0-100 cm soil depth increased by 11.1% and 3.6% under NTSM and NTSGM, respectively, during the soybean full bloom stage, and by 13.06% and 6.6% before wheat sowing. Compared with CK, the decomposition of green manure increased the NO3--N contents in the 0-100 cm soil depth by 6.6% and 5.3% under NTSGM before wheat sowing and after harvesting, respectively, and NTSM and NTSGM significantly improved the soil nutrients, microbial biomass contents, and enzyme activities. The superior soil quality and water content under NTSM and NTSGM increased the fertilizer uptake and partial factor productivity. Compared with CK, the average precipitation storage efficiency, water use efficiency during the whole year, biomass, and wheat yield were 32.6%, 23.2%, 16.2%, and 21.6% higher under NTSGM, respectively. Therefore, NTSGM is an effective method for improving the soil water storage and NO3--N contents before sowing wheat, as well as the water use efficiency, soil quality, utilization of nutrients, and wheat productivity in semi-arid areas of the Loess Plateau.

In this study, lipidomic analyses based on electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) were carried out to explore dynamic changes of membrane lipids in term of molecular species caused by PEG (Polyethylene glycol-6000)-induced water stress in wheat seedlings. Results Among the main phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) are primary degradation targets, and PC was degraded in the largest degree. Membrane ion leakage dramatically increased later than the significant reduction of these phospholipids, indicating that the loss of membrane integrity lagged behind severe phospholipid degradation. Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) increased firstly and decreased later, while digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) ratcheted up with stress. DGDG/MGDG increased after stress for 3 days, and unsaturation of DGDG was promoted with stress. Variation trends of galactolipids differed among molecular species. The time when MGDG (34:3), DGDG (34:3) began to decline approached to the time when non-stomatal limitation impaired photosynthesis. While the two predominant molecular species MGDG (36:6) and DGDG (36:6) began to decline later. So we speculated that MGDG (34:3), DGDG (34:3) might be key components in photosynthesis apparatus and participate in photosynthesis directly. While the two predominant molecular species, MGDG (36:6) and DGDG (36:6) might locate in thylakoid lipid bilayer matrix and play roles in stabilizing the membrane. The research provides new insights into the dynamic response of lipid metabolism to PEG-induced water stress. Conclusion In wheat plants under water stress, the major molecular species of PC, PE and PG were degraded, MGDG and DGDG molecular species had differing degradation time courses.

Early detection of land degradation could help to avoid further deterioration and work on reversing the trend. This would require an integrated approach combining indicators such as vegetation condition, soil health (i.e., soil salinity), and soil exposure (i.e., albedo) to characterize land degradation comprehensively. Therefore, this study aims at developing a satellite image-based combined land degradation index to monitor the spatial extent of land degradation in the Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia. In addition, the study also evaluates the environmental change associated with land degradation across the Tana-Beles watershed. The combined land degradation index (CLDI) was developed by integrating multiple indicators, including normalized vegetation Index (NDVI), salinity index (SI), and albedo, for two periods spanning between 1990 and 2000 (1990s) and 2010 to 2020 (2010s). The individual indicators were combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) by assigning weights to the individual indicators. The analysis indicated that, in the 2010s, the vegetation condition deteriorated over 98.5% of the study area, while soil salinity and albedo increased by 82% and 97% in the 1990s, respectively. The combined land degradation index developed with the PCA indicated in the 2020s a fraction of the study area similar to 2% is extremely degraded, while 18%, 43%, 27%, and 10% of the site is strongly, moderately, slightly, and not degraded, respectively. Monitoring land degradation is important for countries like Ethiopia, where most of the county are occupied by semi-arid and arid climate zones.

Visha; Nath, Rajib			Response of autumn sown black gram as influenced by cobalt, potassium and boron nutrition under Indian subtropics	JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION												Black gram [Vigna mungo (L.) Hepper] is a widely grown pulse crop assuming considerable importance of food and nutritional security in India. A two-year experiment was conducted to find out the effect of cobalt (Co), potassium (K), and boron (B) on growth, yield, quality, and production economics of autumn sown black gram (variety: Pant Urd 31) under Gangetic alluvium soil (order: Inceptisol) in a split plot design with two different combinations of soil incorporation of Co as main plot and five foliar nutrition levels of K and B either single or in combination as subplot treatments during autumn seasons of 2020 and 2021. Pooled estimation revealed that crop growth rate, leaf area index, net assimilation rate, pods per plant, seeds per pod, seed yield, and benefit-cost ratio were significantly higher (p & LE; 0.05) with 4 kg ha(-1) soil Co and foliar 1.25% K + 0.2% B applications as compared to no cobalt application and no spray respectively. This particular combination of soil application of Co along with foliar K + B spray also stimulated symbiotic efficiency, chlorophyll biosynthesis, and nitrate reductase activity along with improving the nutrients and protein contents in harvested seeds. Fluctuations in yield attributes explained about more than 85% variations in seed yield of both years through linear regressions.

Both the treatment and control seeds were sown in well-prepared beds in greenhouse to develop M2 plants. Data on quantitative and qualitative traits were collected and analyzed using GenStat 16 software. Results showed significant differences among the M2 seeds treated with 0.75% NaN3. The highest mean number of capsules per plant was recorded in ACC44 and Baha Necho genotypes, while the lowest was recorded in Gumero, Setit 2, Hirhir, ADI, Bounji and Aberghele. The highest mean number of seeds per capsule was recorded in Humera 1, Baha Necho, Zeri Tesfay, and Gondar 1 genotypes and the lowest was recorded in Setit 1, Setit 2 and ADI. The highest mean capsule length was observed in Zeri Tesfay while the lowest was recorded in Aberghele. The qualitative data reported that Hirhir, Setit 1 and Setit 2 were changed from completely shattering to partially shattering, Gumero and Bounji were changed from completely shattering to non-shattering, and Zeri Tesfay was changed from partially shattering to non-shattering. The 14 genotypes were clustered into four distinct groups including cluster I containing six genotypes, cluster II and III containing two genotypes each and cluster IV containing four genotypes. The mutants developed from Zeri Tesafy, ACC44 and Baha Necho genotypes are considered as potential candidate mutants for further utilization in sesame improvement.

MAGIC lines in chickpea: development and exploitation of genetic diversity	EUPHYTICA												In chickpea a multi-parent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population was developed using eight parents that are improved varieties and widely adaptable breeding lines. The main objective was to enhance the genetic diversity and bring novel alleles for developing superior chickpea varieties. The development scheme involved a sequence of 28 two-way, 14 four-way and 7 eight-way crosses, followed by bulking of final F-1 plants. From F-2 generation onwards single plants were grown as progenies and advanced to F-8 by single seed descent method. The finally developed 1136 MAGIC lines were phenotyped under rainfed (RF) and irrigated (IR) conditions for 2 years (2013 and 2014) under normal season, and one year under heat stress (HS) condition (summer-2014) in field to estimate the genetic diversity created among these lines. Under RF-2014, RF-2013, IR-2014, IR-2013 and S-2014 seasons 46, 62, 83, 50 and 61 lines showed significantly higher grain yield than the best parent, respectively. Similarly, 23 and 19 common lines were identified under RF and IR conditions over two years and no common line was identified between RF/IR and HS conditions. Preliminary evaluation showed a large variation among MAGIC lines for flowering time (34-69 days), maturity (80-120 days), plant height (23.3-65 cm), grain yield (179-4554 kg/ha), harvest index (0.10-0.77) and 100 seed weight (10-45 g) under RF and IR conditions. Several genotypes with higher grain yield than the best check under heat stress were identified. These MAGIC lines provide a useful germplasm source with diverse allelic combinations to global chickpea community.

Vegetation and soil water play critical roles for regulating the hydrological process of gully banks and preventing the soil collapse of gully edge in arid and semi-arid areas. However, the effects of different vegetation on the distribution of soil water in the gully edge are still unknown in semi-arid areas. In this study, the variation in soil water content (SWC) was studied at distances of 0.5 m (D0.5), 2.0 m (D2.0), and 3.5 m (D3.5) from the gully edge in a shrubland (SL), bare land after removal of shrubs (SBL), grassland (GL), and bare land after removal of grasses (GBL). The results showed that SWC reduced with proximity to the gully edge in SBL and GBL. Soil water storage in both SL and GL was higher at D0.5 than at D2.0 and D3.5. In both dry and wet seasons, SWC in SL was significantly lower than that in GL at all locations (P < 0.05). Compared with SBL, the SWC in SL in the wet season significantly reduced 15.42%, 27.56%, and 27.73% at D0.5, D2.0, and D3.5, respectively (P < 0.05). Our findings suggest that grasses should be considered as a suitable choice for revegetation in gully banks to prevent excessive soil water depletion by shrubs and reduce the risk of soil collapse in the gully edge. These findings provide insights into the effects of different vegetation types on soil hydrological processes in gully edges.

J	Zhu, YJ; Cui, YQ				Zhu, Yuanjun; Cui, Yaqiang			Soil Water Dynamics and Winter Wheat Performance under Precipitation Change in the Loess Tableland Region, China	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												The responses of soil water and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to changes in precipitation are crucial for stability of wheat yield and soil water conservation in the Chinese Loess Tableland Region (LTR). A 2-yr (2014-2016) experiment was conducted in the LTR to investigate soil water dynamics and winter wheat performance under three precipitation levels: Rc (normal), R+ (increased by one-third of normal), and R- (decreased by one-third of normal) by a real-time precipitation allocation system. Soil water storage (SWS) at a depth of 0-3.8 m showed positive (R+) or negative (R-) responses to precipitation. The mean SWS in different soil layers followed an order of R+ > Rc > R-. During the experiment, the 0-3.8 m SWS decreased by 34.5 mm (R+), 183.8 mm (Rc), and 218.9 mm (R-). The shoot biomass and grain yield varied little among three precipitation levels in 2014-2015, but was reduced by 50% in R- compared with Rc in 2015-2016. The R- and Rc treatments had higher water use efficiency (WUE) than R+ in 2014-2015, and Rc was the highest in 2015-2016. The proportions of soil water to water consumption in R+ and Rc increased from 22.5% in 2014-2015 to 42.5% in 2015-2016 on average, and for R- was stable over 2-yr (average 44.5%). Soil water plays a critical role in winter wheat performance under changes in precipitation, which should guide winter wheat production and soil water management in the future.																			0002-1962	1435-0645				SEP-OCT	2019	111	5					2184	2192		10.2134/agronj2018.10.0690	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2018.10.0690													WOS:000484435400005
J	Zhao, M; Guo, SL; Wang, R				Zhao, Man; Guo, Shengli; Wang, Rui			Diverse soil respiration responses to extreme precipitation patterns in arid and semiarid ecosystems	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												Projected increases in the frequency and magnitude of extreme precipitation profoundly impact terrestrial ecosystems. However, the response of soil respiration to changing precipitation patterns has not been systematically investigated, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. Precipitation amounts of 300 and 600 mm (T300 and T600) were set to simulate normal and extremely wet summers, respectively, and were individually conducted by wetting soils in a series of sub-events?10 or 100 mm (P10, P100)?over equal time intervals. Maize straw (1300 kg ha-1) and N fertilization (200 kg N ha-1) were applied in parallel to extend our simulation to natural cropland conditions. Soil respiration pulses were observed after T300-P100, and inhibited effects occasionally occurred 1 day after T600-P100, primarily because frequent and harsh storms in T600-P100 induced saturation stress on soil respiration. Cumulative soil respiration in T600 was greater than that in T300, owing to prolonged suitable water conditions for soil respiration. Similarly, for the same total precipitation amount, P100 produced 40?44% more soil respiration than P10. Applying N and maize straw did not change response trends but produced different magnitudes of response to changing precipitation patterns. Maize straw significantly stimulated soil respiration, and this effect became more evident in P100 with improved water conditions, producing a 122?185% increase in cumulative soil respiration. Nitrogen slightly inhibited soil respiration; this effect was enhanced when maize straw was also added but was insignificant. Cumulative soil respiration was significantly correlated with ?-Dglucosidase and soil microbial biomass carbon content. Such soil respiration responses highlight the need to accurately account for soil respiration contributions when projecting global carbon cycling in future climate scenarios.																			0929-1393	1873-0272				JUL	2021	163								103928	10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.103928	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.103928		FEB 2021											WOS:000647783900018
J	Meylan, G; Thiombiano, BA; Le, QB				Meylan, Gregoire; Thiombiano, Boundia Alexandre; Le, Quang Bao			Towards assessing the resource criticality of agricultural livelihood systems	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Despite the many advantages of sustainable intensification (SI), the level of adoption of SI practices in African smallholding farms is still very low, highlighting the need for adequate methods for monitoring farm sustain ability. Research on SI and related poverty alleviation strategies focus either on the "problems" or on the "solutions" for agricultural livelihood systems (ALS) with separate sets of indicators developed accordingly. Bridging the two approaches, we propose an indicator set to assess the criticality of a resource to ALSs in order to support smallholders, decision-makers, and practitioners in the process of SI. The set indicates what problems an ALS faces in the form of resource supply risks and the ALS's ability to successfully cope with such problems, i.e., how resilient it is to these supply risks. We apply the ALS criticality approach (ALSCA) to macronutrients in three different ALS types in the village cluster of Pontieba, Ioba Province, Burkina Faso. Two criticality indicators are highlighted. First, the three ALS types are not facing equal nitrogen supply risks, when the latter is informed by depletion time. The depletion time indicates the time until which a resource stock is depleted at the current mining rate. The average depletion time of soil nitrogen stocks ranges from some 10 to 165 years. Second, the reliance on own resources is an indicator measuring resilience to supply restriction. In Pontieba, regardless of macronutrient, reliance on own nutrients never surpasses 50% when ALS averages are considered. The study showed that the ALSCA can contribute to the implementation of SI practices through support at four levels: 1) providing a holistic view on the ALS to avoid problem-shifting and enable prioritization, 2) providing options to reduce resource criticality, 3) mutual learning between ALSCA practitioners and smallholder farmers through knowledge integration, and 4) facilitating policy coherence from local to national levels thanks to the ALSCA's applicability on different scales.

Since the drivers of drought vary among regions, there is no universal drought index applicable to different regions. The Shiyang River Basin, an inland river basin, located in Gansu Province, China, has a closed water cycle system. Drought is a dominant nature disaster for the sustainable development of the region. Thus, this is an ideal area to explore the suitability of drought-monitoring indices. Here, we took the Shiyang River Basin as an example, in order to explore suitable indicators for agricultural drought monitoring in inland river basins. This study assessed the twelve different widely used drought indices used for monitoring the impact of drought on crop growth, represented by net primary production (NPP). The results showed that the vegetation status-based drought indices (VCI and NVSWI) had the highest significant correlation (0.6 <= |R| <= 1, p < 0.05) on NPP, and the integrated drought indices (DSI and ISDI) had the strong significant correlation (0.4 <= |R| < 0.6, p < 0.1). These four indices are good indicators for agricultural drought monitoring. Studies based on these four indices showed that agricultural drought has a tendency to slow down from 1982 to 2020. This is inconsistent with the monitoring of drought indices based on the meteorological variables that show a trend of increasing drought. This is mainly due to the increased efficiency of water management and its use in inland river basins. This indicates that other water resource information, such as runoff, should be included to construct an integrated agricultural drought-monitoring indices in management intensive regions, such as in an inland river basin.																				2073-4395				FEB	2023	13	2							469	10.3390/agronomy13020469	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13020469													WOS:000938422600001
J	Jafari, L; Asadi, S; Asgari, A				Jafari, Leila; Asadi, Sara; Asgari, Ashkan			Temporal and regional shifts of crop species diversity in rainfed and irrigated cropland in Iran	PLOS ONE												Concerns about the negative effects of declining agricultural biodiversity due to modern agricultural practices and climatic constraints in various parts of the world, including Iran, on the sustainability of agricultural ecosystems are increasingly growing. However, the historical knowledge of temporal and spatial biodiversity is lacking. To determine the value and trend of crop diversity in Iran, we used biodiversity indices based on the area under rainfed and irrigated crops and total cropland area from 1991 to 2018. There were large fluctuations in the amount of cultivated area in the past 30 years, peaking around 2005 to 2007 with about 13.1 million cultivated hectares. However, no general trend in increase or decrease of total cultivated land was shown. The crop species diversity of irrigated cropland was higher than the rainfed and total cropland. The Shannon diversity index showed a constant trend with a negligible slope, but species richness was increased, which was related to the rise in the area of some crop species in recent years. The area of wheat and barley had a significant impact on crop diversity, so Shannon diversity index reduced with their dominance. Overall, this study revealed that the Iranian agricultural system relies on wheat and barley. We warn that by increasing the area of these crops and the prevalence of monoculture, the probability of damage from external factors such as sudden weather changes or the spread of diseases will increase, leading to instability and production risks in the future.					jafari, leila/AHC-6632-2022; Asadi, Sara/P-7115-2019	Asadi, Sara/0000-0002-4658-1061; jafari, leila/0000-0003-4811-8406; asgari, ashkan/0000-0002-4666-1520													1932-6203					MAR 11	2022	17	3							e0264702	10.1371/journal.pone.0264702	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264702								35275954					WOS:000849994500022

Soils contain a huge amount of inorganic carbon in arid and semiarid regions, which may be a potential source of CO2 emitted to the atmosphere. Neglecting soil inorganic carbon could result in erroneous or misleading interpretations of the soil carbon pool of arid and semiarid ecosystems. Nevertheless, only a few studies have focused on variations of SIC, or have further used the soil stable carbon isotope to explore the inherent mechanism of SIC variations in semiarid regions. The study was designed to estimate the dynamic of SOC and SIC with the development of desertification in the topsoil. Here, four desertification stages were chosen, including potential desertification (PD), light desertification (LD), severe desertification (SD), and very severe desertification (VSD) stages, to evaluate the horizontal and vertical distributions of SOC and SIC, and the stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) of SOC and SIC with the desertification development in the topsoil (0-30 cm soil layer). The SOC and SIC contents and storage changed significantly with desertification development. The PD stages had the highest SOC (21.01 mg/hm(2)) and SIC (11.60 mg/hm(2)) storage at 0-30 cm, while the contrary result for VSD stages, with the average of SOC and SIC, was 8.27 mg/hm(2) and 6.15 mg/hm(2), respectively. The vertical distribution of SIC and SOC has varied sharply with soil depth. The delta C-13-SIC within the 0-30 cm soil profile in the PD stages were more negative than those in other desertification stages and gradually increased with desertification development. In contrast, the delta C-13-SOC generally decreased with desertification progress. The entire data (108 soil samples) exhibited that delta C-13-SIC were significantly and negatively correlated with delta C-13-SOC and SIC content, while SIC storage was significantly and positively correlated with SOC storage. The results demonstrated that an increase of SOC might be related to enhancing accumulation of SIC. The results of this study provide information about the variation of SIC and SOC with the desertification development and contribute to our understanding of the important role of SIC in estimating the carbon sequestration capacity in the degraded grassland ecosystems in arid and semiarid regions.					li, xiao/HJP-5134-2023; Liu, Rentao/C-7848-2013	Liu, Rentao/0000-0001-6537-1986; An, Hui/0000-0002-5881-4213													0925-8574	1872-6992				FEB	2019	127						348	355		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2018.12.014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2018.12.014													WOS:000455632500036

Soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, available nutrients, and yield under different straw returning methods	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Straw returning is an important measure for improving soil organic matter, biological activity, and nutrient availability. Straw mulching and straw burying are two methods for returning straw to the soil; however, there is little information to compare their benefits and limitations. This study assessed changes in soil nutrients induced by straw mulching and straw burying using a meta-analysis of straw returning data from 420 publications in China. The results showed that straw burying significantly increased soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen (STN), soil total phosphorus (STP), soil total potassium (STK), soil available nitrogen (SAN), soil available phosphorus (SAP), and soil available potassium (SAK) in the surface soil (0-20 cm), with mean effect sizes of 0.126, 0.095, 0.056, 0.053, 0.118, 0.117, 0.138, respectively. Straw mulching increased SOC, STN, STP, SAN, SAP, and SAK in the surface soil, with mean effect sizes of 0.114, 0.079, 0.082, 0.125, 0.152, 0.150, respectively. Straw burying is more conducive to increasing SOC, STN, and STK, while straw mulching is more conducive to increasing SAN, SAP, and SAK. Straw mulching increased soil nutrient contents more than straw burying in areas with mean annual precipitation (MAP) <400 mm, while the reverse was true in areas with MAP> 800 mm. Straw mulching and straw burying both increased crop yield, with mean effect sizes of 0.100 and 0.101, respectively. Straw burying positively correlated with the effect size of yield, SOC, SAP, and SAK, while there were no significant relationships for straw mulching. Long-term straw burying and straw mulching was conducive to increasing crop yields, SOC, and STN. The benefits and limitations of straw mulching and burying on soil fertility and yield vary under different agronomic management, environmental, and edaphic factors.

Owing to rich SOM and nutrients of woody peat results in it's widely applied in degraded soil for improving land productivity. But how the impacted of woody peat addition on crop growth and soil organic matter (SOM) in different textured degenerated erodible soils are not well understood. Here, along the latitudinal gradient from north to south of China, four typical regional soils collected in Northeast (black soil), Northwest (loessial soil), Central (lou soil) and South (red soil) of China, where suffered strongly soil erosion. Soil clay content was 37.0%, 16.9%, 29.6%, and 38.5% for the black, loessial, lou, and red soils, respectively. We conducted a plot incubation experiment in a fully ventilated, rainproof outdoor greenhouse for planting wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The study is aimed to investigate the response of different texture eroded soil to crop growth and physiology, soil evaporation and soil organic matter after woody peat addition. Eight treatments have been designed for four soils with two groups. (i) the control group with no woody peat addition, B0, H0, L0 and R0; (ii) woody peat addition group, BW, HW, LW and RW. Overall, the SOM concentration altered wheat growth characteristic and grain yield in the four typical erosion degraded soils. The highest grain yield of winter wheat is 6.5 +/- 1.3 g per plot in B0 and 6.5 +/- 1.1 g per plot in BW, and the lowest is 0.4 +/- 0.1 g per plot in R0 in red soil. But woody peat addition increased the wheat yield or yield variation, the wheat gain yield increased four times with woody peat addition (RW) than control (R0) in red soil. In addition, the results revealed that the SOM content were increased in black soil by 40.4%, in loessial soil by 40.0%, in lou soil by 101.3%, and in red soil by 94.6% when compared to the control treatments at harvest. From sowing to harvest, SOM decreased by 5.1 +/- 1.8 g kg-1 (black soil), 9.9 +/- 0.9 g kg-1 (loessial soil), 7.6 +/- 1.8 g kg-1 (lou soil), and 6.2 +/- 1.0 g kg-1 (red soil) in the soils with woody peat addition. Without woody peat addition, SOM decreased by 5.6 g kg-1 (black soil), 4.7 g kg-1 (lou soil), and 0.6 g kg-1 (red soil), but increased by 0.4 g kg-1 in loessial soil. In conclusion, woody peat addition resulted in wheat yield increasing in the degenerated soils, but it's significant in the red soil with adequate nutrient supply and increased soil acid buffering capacity. Woody peat addition increased the SOM concentration in the four degenerated soils, but a faster decreasing rate of the Delta SOM in coarse-textured loessial soil than others medium-fine texture soils.

More deeply research should have been focused on the impact of woody peat addition in coarse-textured soil on the soil environment (such as the clay type, content, and soil priming effect, etc.).

It has a large potential for global warming, a long lifetime and can deplete ozone. In China, nitrogenous fertilizer is an important source of N2O in agricultural soils, especially in vegetable production, where large amounts of nitrogen fertilizers are commonly used. Isotopomer ratios of N2O, oxygen and bulk nitrogen isotope values (delta O-18 and delta N-15(bulk)) and intramolecular N-15 site preferences (SP) have recently been used to identify the sources of N2O. In this study, vegetable farm soil was incubated with manure (M), compound fertilizers (CF) and no fertilizers (NF). The acetylene inhibition method and a N-15 isotopic technique were used to reveal the most likely microbial processes leading to N2O emissions. The results showed that the M treatment produced smaller N2O emissions than the CF treatment of the soil. Nitrifier denitrification or denitrifier denitrification made the greatest contribution to N2O production in the M treatment, accounting for approximately 60-89% of N2O production, whereas it was 25-55% and 37-66% in the CF and NF treatments under non-acetylene conditions, respectively. Under non-acetylene conditions, N2O reduction to N-2 was largest for treatment M (32-90%), intermediate for NF (42-77%) and smallest for CF (20-51%). The results also showed that nitrifier nitrification and N2O reduction were partly inhibited under acetylene conditions, with a relative contribution of 9-20% and 0-83% for M, 39-48% and 0-46% for CF, and 25-35% and 0-56% for NF, respectively. Our results suggest that analysing isotopomer ratios of N2O with SP would be a practical approach for determining the contributions of microbial processes to N2O emissions from different pools in soil. The results revealed that manure produced smaller N2O emissions and promoted relatively larger rates of denitrification and N2O reduction than compound fertilizers with the same amount of N, which indicated that complementing chemical with manure fertilizers might help to reduce N2O emissions on vegetable-producing land. Highlights We investigated emissions and sources of N2O with different types of fertilizers. For the same amount of N, manure produced less N2O than compound fertilizer. Stable isotope analysis revealed that denitrification was the dominant process in the manure treatment. The acetylene inhibition method can supplement delta N-15(bulk) compared with the SP model to assess N2O reduction in soil.

Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is an important crop for food security in the tropics and heat stress is expected to cause increasing yield losses. To study physiological responses and to characterize the genetics of heat stress tolerance, we evaluated the recombinant inbred line (RIL) population IJR (Indeterminate Jamaica Red) x AFR298 of the Andean gene pool. Heat stress (HS) conditions in the field affected many traits across the reproductive phase. High nighttime temperatures appeared to have larger effects than maximum daytime temperatures. Yield was reduced compared to non-stress conditions by 37% and 26% in 2016 and 2017 seasons, respectively. The image analysis tool HYRBEAN was developed to evaluate pollen viability (PolVia). A significant reduction of PolVia was observed in HS and higher viability was correlated with yield only under stress conditions. In susceptible lines the reproductive phase was extended and defects in the initiation of seed, seed fill and seed formation were identified reducing grain quality. Higher yields under HS were correlated with early flowering, high pollen viability and effective seed filling. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis revealed a QTL for both pod harvest index and PolVia on chromosome Pv05, for which the more heat tolerant parent IJR contributed the positive allele. Also, on chromosome Pv08 a QTL from IJR improved PolVia and the yield component pods per plant. HS affected several traits during the whole reproductive development, from floral induction to grain quality traits, indicating a general heat perception affecting many reproductive processes. Identification of tolerant germplasm, indicator traits for heat tolerance and molecular tools will help to breed heat tolerant varieties to face future climate change effects.						raatz, bodo/0000-0003-0556-0691; Vargas, Yulieth/0000-0002-5036-2689													1932-6203					APR 29	2021	16	4							e0249859	10.1371/journal.pone.0249859	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249859								33914759					WOS:000664603100022

Aridity modifies the responses of plant stoichiometry to global warming and nitrogen deposition in semi-arid steppes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Global warming and nitrogen (N) deposition arc known to unbalance the stoichiometry of carbon (C), N, and phosphorus (P) in terrestrial plants, but it is unclear how water availability regulates their effects along a natural aridity gradient. Here, we conducted manipulative experiments to determine the effects of experimental warming (WT) and N addition (NT) on plant stoichiometry in desert, typical, and meadow steppes with decreasing aridity. WP elevated air temperatures by 1.2-2.9 degrees C using open-top chambers. WT increased forb C:N ratio and thus its N use efficiency and competitiveness in desert steppes, whereas WT reduced forb C:N and C:P ratios in typical and meadow steppes. Plant N:P ratio, which reflects nutrient limitation, was reduced by WI in desert steppes but not for typical or meadow steppes. NT reduced plant C:N ratios and increased N:P ratios in all three steppes. NT reduced forb C:P ratios in desert and typical steppes, but it enhanced grass C:P ratio in meadow steppes, indicating an enhancement of P use efficiency and competitiveness of grasses in wet steppes. WT and NT had synergetic effects on grass C:N and C:P ratios in all three steppes, which helps to increase grasses' productivity. Under WI' or NT, the changes in community C:N ratio were positively correlated with increasing aridity, indicating that aridity increases plants N use efficiency. However, aridity negatively affected the changes in N:P ratios under NT but not WT, which suggests that aridity mitigates P limitation induced by N deposition. Our results imply that warming could shift the dominant functional group into forbs in dry steppes due to altered stoichiometry, whereas grasses become dominated plants in wet steppes under increasing N deposition. We suggest that global changes might break the stoichiometric balance of plants and water availability could strongly modify such processes in semi-arid steppes.

Therefore, isolating and identifying the spatiotemporal characteristics of T/ET and its response to the individual and interactive effects of climatic factors will help us better understand the carbon and water cycle characteristics of ecosystems. The arid region of Central Asia has always been in the restricted area of carbon-water cycle ob-servations due to scarce station observations, harsh climatic conditions, and severe anthropogenic disturbances. Using a specific Arid Ecosystem Model (AEM), this study explored the temporal and spatial dynamic patterns of T/ET of different plant functional types (PFTs) in drylands of Central Asia based on multi-climate scenarios, and separated and quantified the independent and interactive effects of different environmental factors. The result indicated that precipitation dominated the areas of 86% (ET, evapotranspiration), 77% (T, transpiration), and 71% (the ratio of T/ET) in the arid region of Central Asia, respectively. The effect of temperature on the ratio of T/ET was negative and slight. And the temperature increase effect is only 9.7% of the negative effect of pre-cipitation. Affected by the insignificant effect of CO2 enrichment on T, the interactive effect between climate change and CO2 effect appear to be little and negative. According to the vegetation growth and the spatial distribution of precipitation, we found that the southern Xinjiang region and the Turgay Plateau in northwestern Kazakhstan are the ecologically vulnerable areas in Central Asian. The results also indicated that general warming in this region may not have a direct and significant impact on vegetation T/ET in the future. We may need to pay more attention to the indirect effect of enhanced evaporation and reduced moisture on T/ET caused by future warming.

Groups of Coordinate Transformations between Accelerated Frames	SYMMETRY-BASEL												The analysis of the present paper reveals that, besides the relativistic symmetry expressed by the Lorentz group of coordinate transformations which leave invariant the Minkowski metric of space-time of inertial frames, there exists one more relativistic symmetry expressed by a group of coordinate transformations leaving invariant the space-time metric of the frames with a constant proper-acceleration. It is remarkable that, in the flat space-time, only those two relativistic symmetries, corresponding to groups of continuous transformations leaving invariant the metric of space-time of extended rigid reference frames, exist. Therefore, the new relativistic symmetry should be considered on an equal footing with the Lorentz symmetry. The groups of transformations leaving invariant the metric of the space-time of constant proper-acceleration are determined using the Lie group analysis, supplemented by the requirement that the group include transformations to or from an inertial to an accelerated frame. Two-parameter groups of two-dimensional (1 + 1), three-dimensional (2 + 1), and four-dimensional (3 + 1) transformations, with the group parameters related to the ratio of accelerations of the frames and the relative velocity of the frame space origins at the initial moment, can be considered as counterparts of the Lorentz group of corresponding dimensions. Defining the form of the interval and the groups of coordinate transformations satisfying the relativity principle paves the way to defining the invariant forms of the laws of dynamics and electrodynamics in accelerated frames. Thus, the problem of extending the relativity principle from inertial to uniformly accelerated frames has been resolved without use of the equivalence principle and/or the general relativity equations. As an application of the transformations to purely kinematic phenomena, the problem of differential aging between accelerated twins is treated.

Evaluation and application of the CROPGRO-soybean model for determining optimum sowing windows of soybean in the Nigeria savannas	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Soybean production is limited by poor soil fertility and unstable rainfall due to climate variability in the Nigeria savannas. There is a decline in the amount and duration of rainfall as one moves from the south to north of the savanna zones. The use of adapted soybean varieties and optimum sowing windows are avenues to increase productivity in the face of climate variability. Crop simulation models can be used as tools for the evaluation of alternative management options for a particular location, including fertilizer application rates, plant density, sowing dates and land use. In this study, we evaluated the performance of the Cropping System Model (CSM)-CROPGRO-Soybean to determine optimum sowing windows for three contrasting soybean varieties (TGX1835-10E, TGX1904-6F and TGX1951-3F) cultivated in the Nigeria savannas. The model was calibrated using data from ten field experiments conducted under optimal conditions at two sites (BUK and Dambatta) in Kano in the Sudan savanna (SS) agro-ecology over four growing seasons. Data for model evaluation were obtained from independent experiment for phosphorus (P) response trials conducted under rainfed conditions in two locations (Zaria and Doguwa) in the northern Guinea savanna (NGS) zone. The model calibration and evaluation results indicated good agreement between the simulated and observed values for the measured parameters. This suggests that the CROPGRO-Soybean model was able to accurately predict the performance of soybean in the Nigeria savannas. Results from long-term seasonal analysis showed significant differences among the agro-ecologies, sowing windows and the soybean varieties for grain yield. Higher yields are simulated among the soybean varieties in Zaria in the NGS than in Kano the SS and Jagiri in the southern Guinea savanna (SGS) agro-ecological zones. Sowing from June 1 to July 5 produced optimal yield of TGX1951-3F and TGX1835-10E beyond which yield declined in Kano. In Zaria and Jagiri the simulated results show that, sowing from June 1 to July 12 are appropriate for all the varieties. The variety TGX1951-3F performed better than TGX1904-6F and TGX1835-10E in all the agro-ecologies. The TGX1951-3F is, therefore, recommended for optimum grain yield in the savannas of northern Nigeria. However, the late maturing variety TGX1904-6F is not recommended for the SS due to the short growing season in this zone.

Fish-scale pits (FSPs) and revegetation (RG) are the most common measures for controlling soil erosion on spoil heaps on the Loess Plateau. To evaluate the effects of FSPs and RG on concentrated runoff erosion, scouring-erosion experiments were conducted on FSP plots, RG plots, and bare plots (the control) in the field on two types of spoil heaps: low gravel content in soil (LGS) and high gravel content in soil (HGS) at various inflow rates. Mass movement was the main cause of the considerable fluctuations in erosion rate and sharply increased the sediment concentration, which could exceed 800 kg m(-3)and cause hyperconcentrated flows. Conversely, the FSP and RG treatments observably reduced the sediment concentration and erosion rate. The erosion-reducing benefits (ERBs) of both the FSPs and RG treatments were significant. However, the ERB of the FSPs treatment was superior to that of the RG treatment under concentrated runoff, especially high-intensity concentrated runoff. The ERB of the FSP treatment was on average 78.5% and 80.9% for the LGS and HGS, respectively. The ERB of the RG treatment was on average 36.4% and 56.5% for the LGS and HGS, respectively. The ERBs of the FSPs and RG treatments for the HGS were greater than those for the LGS. Moreover, gravel inhibited concentrated flow erosion. Our results provide important guidance for preventing soil erosion on abandoned spoil heaps in semiarid regions.					chen, zhuoxin/ABH-4099-2020; Guo, Mingming/ABH-4307-2020	chen, zhuoxin/0000-0002-8673-0498; Guo, Mingming/0000-0002-4887-5688; Guo, Wen-Zhao/0000-0002-6510-3719													1085-3278	1099-145X				DEC	2020	31	18					2846	2857		10.1002/ldr.3643	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.3643		JUL 2020											WOS:000545563600001

The Chinese herb rhubarb (Dahuang) is one of the most widely used traditional Chinese medicines in clinical applications. To better understand the physiological activities and mechanism of treating diseases with the herb, it is necessary to conduct intensive research on rhubarb. However, K-hib modification has not been reported thus far in rhubarb. Results In this study, we performed the first global analysis of K-hib-modified proteins in rhubarb by using sensitive affinity enrichment combined with high-accuracy HPLC-MS/MS tandem spectrometry. A total of 4333 overlapping K-hib modification peptides matched on 1525 K-hib-containing proteins were identified in three independent tests. Bioinformatics analysis showed that these K-hib-containing proteins are involved in a wide range of cellular processes, particularly in protein biosynthesis and central carbon metabolism and are distributed mainly in chloroplasts, cytoplasm, nucleus and mitochondria. In addition, the amino acid sequence motif analysis showed that a negatively charged side chain residue (E), a positively charged residue (K), and an uncharged residue with the smallest side chain (G) were strongly preferred around the K-hib site, and a total of 13 K-hib modification motifs were identified. These identified motifs can be classified into three motif patterns, and some motif patterns are unique to rhubarb and have not been identified in other plants to date. Conclusions A total of 4333 K-hib-modified peptides on 1525 proteins were identified. The K-hib-modified proteins are mainly distributed in the chloroplast, cytoplasm, nucleus and mitochondria, and involved in a wide range of cellular processes. Moreover, three types of amino acid sequence motif patterns, including EKhib/KhibE, GK(hib) and k.kkk horizontal ellipsis .K-hib horizontal ellipsis .kkkkk, were extracted from a total of 13 K-hib-modified peptides. This study provides comprehensive K-hib-proteome resource of rhubarb. The findings from the study contribute to a better understanding of the physiological roles of K-hib modification, and the K-hib proteome data will facilitate further investigations of the roles and mechanisms of K-hib modification in rhubarb.																			1471-2164					JUL 15	2021	22	1							542	10.1186/s12864-021-07847-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-07847-0								34266380					WOS:000675234700001

However, their long-term successional patterns and associations with environmental factors are not well understood, especially in semiarid areas where plant community composition and species diversity change rapidly. We investigated changes in soil (Cambisol) microbial communities across a chronosequence of abandoned farmland comprising six successional stages (0, 11, 35, 60, 100, and 150-years) in the semiarid Loess Plateau of China. We aimed to reveal the long-term patterns and succession rates of microbial communities, and to reveal the driving forces. Bacterial and fungal communities were characterized by sequencing bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes and fungal internal transcribed spacers (ITS), respectively. Temporal turnover of microbial succession was investigated using the slope (w value) of linear regression of log-transformed microbial community similarity over time. Succession rate of fungi was approximately three times higher (w = 0.1477, P < 0.0001) than that of bacteria (w = 0.0549, P < 0.0001). Bacterial succession was affected by changes in soil NH4+-N, total N, organic C, water content, bulk density, and pH, whereas fungi were more susceptible to changes in NO3--N, available phosphorus, and C:N ratio. Bacterial communities transitioned from slow-growing oligotrophic groups (Gemmatimonadetes, Chloroflexi) to fast-growing copiotrophic groups (Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria). Basidiomycota showed the highest temporal turnover (w = 0.2000, P < 0.0001), followed by Armatimonadetes, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia, Chloroflexi, and Proteobacteria. These results provide new insights into microbial community dynamics during long-term secondary succession, and enhance our understanding of associations between soil factors and microbes in semiarid ecosystems.

An in-depth understanding on long-term changes in evaporation and its attribution would be beneficial for a clear identification of evaporation paradox. However, the long-term and large-scale studies on evaporation variations were severely lacking on the Loess Plateau. This study examined both spatial and temporal variations in pan evaporation at 52 meteorological stations widespread on the Loess Plateau during 1961-2015. The Mann-Kendall test showed that significant decreases occurred in annual and seasonal pan evaporation (p < 0.05). A principal component analysis indicated that regional-averaged annual pan evaporation experienced a decreasing trend in all three regions (the southwestern, southeastern and the northern regions of the Loess Plateau) with a decreasing rate ranging from -1.83 to -5.18 mm/a (p < 0.05). The annual pan evaporation averaged across all the observations decreased significantly, whereas the average annual temperature increased, indicating the occurrence of a pan evaporation paradox on the Loess Plateau. Our results also showed that the pan evaporation was mostly sensitive to actual vapor pressure (e(a)), followed by solar radiation (Rs), mean temperature (T-mean) and wind speed (U-2). An increase in temperature resulted in an elevated pan evaporation; however, this was offset by an increase in vapor pressure and a decrease in wind speed and solar radiation. Wind speed was the dominant factor contributing to the pan evaporation decrease on the Loess Plateau. The results provided a useful reference for a more effective regional water resource management and ecological restoration.

However, the main N2O production pathways and microbes underlying N2O production in calcareous cropland soil under long-term plastic film mulching and nitrogen (N) management have not yet been clarified. Here, we used 15N tracing combined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction to evaluate the relative contributions of different N2O production pathways (i.e., autotrophic nitrification, heterotrophic nitrification, and denitrification) to N2O production in a calcareous maize field soil; we also used specific inhibitors (acetylene and 1-octyne) to determine the functional importance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) to N2O production. Auto-trophic nitrification accounted for 47-63% and 76-100% of total N2O emissions in unfertilized (F0) and N-fertilized soils, respectively. AOB accounted for 62% and 91-98% of total N2O production in F0 and N-fertilized soils, respectively. N2O production was significantly lower in soils following long-term film mulching (F225) compared with the bare land soil (N225), and this was due to the reduced abundance and activity of AOB and N2O derived from autotrophic nitrification. Autotrophic nitrification-derived N2O emissions were 2.2-fold, 3.6-fold, and 6.3-fold higher in the F225 treatment (appropriate N level), the treatment in which the level of N was the same as that applied by local farmers (F380), and the manure addition treatment (F225+M) compared with F0, respectively, indicating that autotrophic nitrification was the main driver of increases in N2O emissions. These findings provide the first direct evidence showing that AOB-driven autotrophic nitrification is the dominant N2O production pathway in the plastic film mulched calcareous soils under different agricultural management practices. Our results also show that autotrophic nitrification is depressed by long-term mulching and promoted by N fertilization.

This study selected 64 catchments located in the mainland of China to quantify the effects of different driving forces on runoff changes. Results showed that annual runoff in the Haihe river basin, Liaohe river basin, and Yellow river basin exhibited significantly decreasing trends from 1965 to 2018 (P < 0.05), whereas the Northwest river basin had positive trends in the annual runoff. Meanwhile, the Pettitt test method was applied to detect abrupt changes in annual runoff. Compared to the rivers in Southern China, the northern rivers had significant abrupt changes in annual runoff and mostly occurred in the 1990 s. The Choudhury-Yang equation based on the Budyko hypothesis was used to assess the sensitivity of runoff to precipitation (P), potential evapotranspiration (ET0), and the land surface (n) changes. The results showed that runoff was more sensitive to P and n, compared to ET0. Attribution analysis revealed that P was the dominant factor in the Northwest river basin, Southwest river basin, Yangtze river basin, Southeast river basin, and Pearl river basin, whereas the changes in n were responsible for runoff changes in the Liaohe river basin, Haihe river basin, Yellow river Basin, Songhuajiang river basin, and Huaihe river basin. The land surface changes (n) were resulted from vegetation restoration, urbanization expansion, construction of reservoirs/check dams, and surface water withdrawals, leading to significant changes in river runoff in recent years. The findings can provide good insight for water resources management across China.

It remains unknown how root exudates affect rhizosphere microbiota and soil functions in the course of forest plantation restoration. The metabolic profiles of tree root exudates are expected to shift with stand age, leading to variation in rhizosphere microbiota structure, and in turn, potentially altering soil functions. To unravel the effects of root exudates, a multi-omics study was conducted using untargeted metabonomic profiling, high-throughput microbiome sequencing and functional gene array. The interactions among root exudates, rhizosphere microbiota and nutrient cycling-related functional genes were explored under 15- to 45-year-old Robinia pseudoacacia plantations in the Loess Plateau region of China. Root exudate metabolic profiles, rather than chemodiversity, markedly changed with an increase in stand age. A total of 138 age-related metabolites were extracted from a key module of root exudates. The relative contents of six biomarker metabolites, such as glucose-1-phosphate, gluconic acid and N-acetylneuraminic acid, increased distinctly over time. The biomarker taxa (16 classes) of rhizosphere microbiota varied in a time-sensitive manner, which played potential roles in nutrient cycling and plant health. Nitrospira, Alphaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria were enriched in the rhizosphere of older stands. Key root exudates influenced functional gene abundances in the rhizosphere via direct effects or indirectly through biomarker microbial taxa (e.g., Nitrososphaeria). Overall, root exudates and rhizosphere microbiota are essential for soil function maintenance in R. pseudoacacia plantation restoration.

The materials were characterized by SEM, TEM, BET, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, XRD, and elemental analysis. A large number of pores were observed in the HCM by SEM and TEM, and the specific surface area of the material, as determined by BET testing, was 1436.21 m(2)/g. The adsorption properties of the HCM were tested by a batch adsorption method. The maximum adsorption capacity of the HCM for Cr(VI) was 332.53 mg/g, and the performance was better than that of a similar materials. The kinetic thermodynamics and intraparticle diffusion models were fit, and it was found that the adsorption of Cr(VI) onto the honeycomb carbon was a spontaneous endothermic process. The regenerative adsorption experiments showed that the material had good regenerative abilities.

In this context, we studied from September 2019 to July 2020, the effectiveness of the mating disruption technique using Isonet (R) T dispensers and the attract-and-kill device SPLAT (R) TUTA against this pest in cherry tomato crops. The three biorational control options tested, Isonet (R) T alone (installed at transplanting), insecticide + Isonet (R) T (installed in January) and SPLAT (R) TUTA + insecticide, showed a high effectiveness against T. absoluta populations. Their field application resulted in a decrease in the number of T. absoluta males captured in water traps by 87.23%, 87.13% and 83.50%, in the egg number by 85.97%, 90.78% and 86%, and in the number of larvae by 65.35%, 65.61% and 80.36%, respectively, as compared to the untreated control. In addition, the use of the three control options reduced the infestation on leaves and fruits by more than 77.17% and 71.21%, respectively. The application of mating disruption and the use of biopesticides significantly reduced leaf and fruit damage. The percentage reduction in leaf and fruit damage was more than 77.17% and 71.21%, respectively, for the three treatments compared with the untreated control. On the other hand, the leaf and fruit infestation percentages did not exceed 12% and 2% for the three treatments, respectively. The study showed that mating disruption applied alone or in combination with bioinsecticides against T. absoluta was effective in heated greenhouses in southern Tunisia. This technique could be a key sustainable option of integrated pest management in tomato crops.																			0334-2123	1876-7184				JUL	2023	51	3					521	532		10.1007/s12600-023-01080-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12600-023-01080-z		APR 2023											WOS:000977834600002

A field study was thus conducted at Varanasi, India during the year 2013-14 and 2014-15 to assess the effect of the recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF) along with cow product (blends of 5 cow by-products i.e., dung, ghee, curd, urine, and milk that is known as panchagavya) on soil health, energy budget, and rice productivity. The results revealed that the inclusion of panchagavya as seedling root dip + 6% spray at 30 days after transplanting (DAT) + an application with irrigation water (15 l ha(-1)) at 60 DAT (D-4) along with 100% RDF (F-3) noted significantly higher rice grain yield (6.34 t ha(-1)) and higher dehydrogenase activity. However, the soil bacterial and actinomycetes population, soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC), urease, and alkaline phosphatase activities were significantly higher with D-4 along with 120% RDF (F-4). Carbon output (5,608 kg CO2 eq ha(-1)), energy use parameters viz. energy output (187,867 MJ ha(-1)), net energy returns (164,319 MJ ha(-1)), and energy intensity valuation (5.08 MJ ) were significantly higher under F-4. However, the energy ratio (8.68), energy productivity (0.292 kg MJ(-1)), and energy profitability (7.68) remained highest with 80% RDF (F-2), while the highest carbohydrate equivalent yield (4,641 kg mha(-1)) was produced under F-3. The combination of F-3 with D-4 resulted in the highest productivity, optimum energy balance, and maintaining soil quality. Therefore, a judicious combination of cow product (panchagavya) with RDF was found to improve the rice productivity, energy profitability, and soil quality under south Asian eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGPs).

J	Chen, ZX; Guo, MM; Wang, WL				Chen, Zhuoxin; Guo, Mingming; Wang, Wenlong			Variations in Soil Erosion Resistance of Gully Head Along a 25-Year Revegetation Age on the Loess Plateau	WATER												The effects of vegetation restoration on soil erosion resistance of gully head, along a revegetation age gradient, remain poorly understood. Hence, we collected undisturbed soil samples from a slope farmland and four grasslands with different revegetation ages (3, 10, 18, 25 years) along gully heads. Then, these samples were used to obtain soil detachment rate of gully heads by the hydraulic flume experiment under five unit width flow discharges (2-6 m(3) h). The results revealed that soil properties were significantly ameliorated and root density obviously increased in response to restoration age. Compared with farmland, soil detachment rate of revegetated gully heads decreased 35.5% to 66.5%, and the sensitivity of soil erosion of the gully heads to concentrated flow decreased with revegetation age. The soil detachment rate of gully heads was significantly related to the soil bulk density, soil disintegration rate, capillary porosity, saturated soil hydraulic conductivity, organic matter content and water stable aggregate. The roots of 0-0.5 and 0.5-1.0 mm had the highest benefit in reducing soil loss of gully head. After revegetation, soil erodibility of gully heads decreased 31.0% to 78.6%, and critical shear stress was improved by 1.2 to 4.0 times. The soil erodibility and critical shear stress would reach a stable state after an 18-years revegetation age. These results allow us to better evaluate soil vulnerability of gully heads to concentrated flow erosion and the efficiency of revegetation.					chen, zhuoxin/ABH-4099-2020; Guo, Mingming/ABH-4307-2020	chen, zhuoxin/0000-0002-8673-0498; Guo, Mingming/0000-0002-4887-5688														2073-4441				DEC	2020	12	12							3301	10.3390/w12123301	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12123301													WOS:000602894900001
J	Jing, H; Wang, GL				Jing, Hang; Wang, Guoliang			Temporal dynamics of <i>Pinus tabulaeformis</i> litter decomposition under nitrogen addition on the Loess Plateau of China	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Litter decomposition in the early stage is determined by the release of easily decomposable substances, and that in the later stage is controlled by the contents of macromolecule compounds and microorganisms according to the two-stage model. However, the specific mechanism on how nitrogen (N) deposition changes litter decomposition on the basis of this model remains unknown. This study investigated the effects of multilevel N addition (control, low, medium, and high N amounts corresponding to 0, 3, 6, and 9 g N m(-2) y(-1), respectively) on the litter decomposition and nutrient release of Pinus tabulaeformis and the microbial community in the later stage on the Loess Plateau of China. Results were as follows. (1) N addition significantly increased the decomposition rate of P. tabulaeformis litter (P < 0.05) with the maximum value observed in the medium N treatment. (2) The release rates of soluble sugar, lignin, carbon (C), and N were significantly promoted by N addition with the best promotion effect found for medium N. Cellulose release was significantly inhibited by N addition, and medium N had the greatest inhibitory effect. (3) N addition had an insignificant effect on microbial community in later-stage decomposition but had significant influence on the relative abundances of Ascomycota, Zygomycota, and Davidiellaceae fungi. (4) Decomposition was controlled by the release of N, soluble sugar, and lignin in the early stage, and C release and three dominant fungal populations played important roles in the late stage. We conclude that the variations in N deposition, litter nutrient release and microbial community are important factors of decomposition and C flux in a forest ecosystem.

In previous studies, a hydroxyproline (HYP)-tolerant peanut mutant, with increased oil contents and 100-grain weight, was introduced. In this study, transcriptome analysis and miRNA profile sequencing of seeds from the HYP-tolerant mutant and the original parent (Huayu 20, the control) were conducted to elucidate the molecular basis for higher grain size and oil contents. Major transcription factors linked to seed development and/or oil biosynthesis (including AP2/EREBP, WRKY, bZIP, DOF, B3 domain, MADS-box, bHLH, and MYB) were differentially expressed between the HYP-tolerant mutant and its parent. Moreover, differentially expressed genes related to seed development or oil biosynthesis like IKU2, oleosins, LTPs, SSPs, ACCases, ACP, and BCCPs were also identified. The miRNA profiling identified 116 differentially expressed miRNAs; and functional analysis emphasized that their target genes i.e., SPL, KCS, PLC, B3 domain transcription factors played an important role during seed development. Findings of this study are highly helpful for further research on peanut seed development and oil biosynthesis. Moreover, this study also provided a potentially usable genomic resource material which can be used for breeding high yielding peanut varieties with more oil contents.

Here, a field experiment was conducted for eight years to investigate the effects of irrigation regimes and fertilizer types on SOC stocks and labile organic carbon concentrations (particulate organic carbon, POC; dissolved organic carbon, DOC; and microbial biomass carbon, MBC). The irrigation regimes were no irrigation (W0); presowing irrigation (W1); presowing and jointing irrigation (W2); and presowing, jointing, and anthesis irrigation (W3). The fertilizer types were no fertilizer (C0), mineral fertilizer only (C1), half mineral plus half cattle manure (C2), and cattle manure only (C3). Thus, sixteen treatments were created and laid out in a split block design with triplicates. Both irrigation and manure application distinctly enhanced SOC accumulation. POC, DOC, and MBC were mainly affected by manure application in surface soil (0-20 cm) and by irrigation in deep soil (40-60 cm). The interaction between irrigation and fertilization on SOC and labile organic carbon concentrations was not significant in the 0-60 cm soil layer. The SOC stocks and relative SOC sequestration rate increased with increasing irrigation and cattle manure inputs. There was no significant difference in SOC stocks between W2C2 (108.15 Mg C ha(-1)) and W3C1 (109.05 Mg C ha(-1)), as well as between W1C2 (90.25 Mg C ha(-1)) and W2C1 (87.07 Mg C ha(-1)), indicating that in W2 and W1, replacing half of the nitrogen with organic manure can result in equal SOC stocks caused by increasing irrigation under mineral fertilizer alone. This study emphasizes the important role that irrigation plays in SOC management and provides theoretical support to improve the SOC stock by reducing irrigation and applying cattle manure in the North China Plain.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				MAY 31	2022	266								107539	10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107539	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107539													WOS:000912915200002

The experiment was laid out in a completely randomized design with 5 treatments [starter cultures; i.e., 1 therrnophilic (STI-12), 2 blended (RST-743 and XPL-2), and 2 mesophilic (R-707 and CHN-22) cultures]. Starter cultures STI-12 and RST-743 were inoculated at 37 degrees C, whereas XPL-2, R-707, and CHN-22 were inoculated at 30 degrees C. Camel milk inoculated using STI-12 and RST-743 cultures resulted in faster acidification than XPL-2, R-707, and CIIN-22 cultures. Camel milk SWC made using STI-12 and CHN-22 cultures gave lower pH (4.54) and titratable acidity (0.59), respectively, whereas R-707 culture resulted in high cheese yield (13.44 g/100 g). In addition, high fat (20.91 g/100 g), protein (17.49 g/100 g), total solids (43.44 g/100 g), and ash (2.40 g/100 g) contents were recorded for SWC made from camel milk made using RST-743 culture. Instrumental analysis of cheese texture revealed differences in resistance to deformation in which camel milk SWC made using RST-743 culture gave higher firmness (3.20 N) and brittleness (3.12 N). However, no significant difference was observed among camel milk SWC adhesiveness made using different starter cultures. Consumer preference for appearance, aroma, taste, and overall acceptances of SWC were affected by inoculation of starter cultures. Considering curd firmness, cheese yield, compositional quality, and textures using STI-12, RST-743, and R-707, these cultures were found to be better for the manufacture of camel milk SWC.

It has been convinced that grazing affects grassland productivity, however, researches on the relationship between grazing intensity and grassland soil quality remain inadequate in the alpine environment. This study compared ten soil quality indexes (SQIs) to quantitative assess the effect of different grazing intensities [no grazing (NG); light grazing (LG); moderate grazing (MG); heavy grazing (HG)] on the soil quality of alpine meadow in the 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm soil layers. Principal component analysis (PCA) and minimum data set (MDS) were applied to indicator selection and weight assignment. The fitting relationship and correlation between SQI-TDS and SQI-MDSs and the sensitivity index (SI) of ten SQIs were used to select the optimal SQI method. Our results showed that compared with NG and LG, HG and MG significantly decreased soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available nitrogen (AN), total phosphorus (TP), and cation exchange capacity (CEC) (p < 0.05), whereas increased bulk density (BD) and pH. Besides, TN, TP, TK, SOM, Sand content, soil phosphatase activity (PHO), soil sucrase activity (SUC), and soil catalase activity (CAT) could well replace the TDS method to evaluate soil quality. The SQI calculated by the MDS4 with the non-linear scoring method (SQI-NL-MDS4) had the best performance in soil quality evaluation among ten SQIs. Compared with NG and LG, HG had a stronger negative effect on alpine meadow soil quality, especially in the 0-10 cm soil layer, which potentially aggravated leading to aggravating grassland degradation. We propose that reasonable grazing intensity management should be advocated to maintain the sustainable development of alpine meadow productivity.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				AUG	2022	141								109111	10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109111	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109111		JUL 2022											WOS:000856110100003

The infiltration hole that has specific depth and volume can be used as a supplemental to slope engineering measures to rapidly reduce rainstorm runoff and store them into deep soil layers. In this study, the performance of infiltration holes (60, 80, and 100 cm in depth and 10 cm in diameter) in intercepting and infiltrating rainstorm runoff was evaluated through the field simulation experiment (rainfall intensity of 1.5 mm min-1). The results showed that infiltration holes directly increased the runoff infiltration area by 0.20, 0.26, and 0.32 m2. Before infiltration holes were filled up, all the runoff were intercepted, the reduced runoff were 5.70, 5.85, 8.85 mm, respectively. When runoff reducing rate reached stable (around 110 min), the stable runoff-reducing rates were 0.079, 0.088, and 0.091 mm min-1, and the cumulative reduced runoff were 15.05, 18.11, and 20.97 mm, accounting for 30.41%, 36.59%, and 42.36% of the simulated rainstorm runoff. This implies that filtration holes could, on average, reduce runoff by 70.50, 132.42, and 256.26 mm within 12, 24, and 48 h, respectively. Based on the results, it was verified that infiltration holes could reduce most of the runoff under the scenario of historical extreme rainstorms in the past two decades. Our research determined the rainfall runoff reduced by infiltration holes and verified the effectiveness of infiltration holes under rainstorm events, and provided a prospective technique for regulating extreme rainstorm runoff and decreasing landslides and mudslides risks on the Loess Plateau.

However, few studies have reported on the changes of biochar properties over the aging process under field conditions. An understanding of such changes can help us to make full use of biochar as a sustainable soil amendment and C sequestration technique. Materials and methods We used apple tree branches as the raw material to produce biochar and studied the changes in the physicochemical properties of the biochar over a 5-year field experiment. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), specific surface area (SSA) and micropore area, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were performed. Results and discussion After 5 years of aging, the SSA of the biochar had increased by 23.91% relative to that of fresh biochar; however, the SSA initially decreased over the first 3 years and then increased over the next 2 years. The reasons for the initial decrease were the destruction and clogging of the existing pore structure, whereas new micropore formation was responsible for the subsequent increase, as verified by micropore area, SEM and XPS analyses. The C content of the biochar was stable over the 5 years, but the surface O content and quantity of oxygen-containing functional groups increased relative to those of fresh biochar, which impacts the adsorption capacity of the biochar. Conclusions Our findings illustrate that the SSA of the biochar varied with time during the aging process. The stability of the C illustrated the potential of biochar as a C sequestration technique. The increase in oxygen-containing functional groups of the biochar was responsible for the process of nutrient adsorption.

We recently reported that nitrogen (N) deficiency enhances the production of terpenoids and cannabinoids, the unique biologically-active secondary metabolites in medical cannabis plants. Knowledge-gaps concerning effects of N supply on primary metabolism in cannabis hinder understanding of the interrelations between N inputs and biosynthesis of the therapeutic secondary metabolites. The present study therefore evaluated the hypothesis that a decrease in the plant's C (carbon): N ratio by Nlimitation, induces a shift in the plant metabolism towards lower production of N-containing metabolites and higher production of metabolites that do not contain N. Effects of N input levels (30, 80, 160, 240, and 320 mg L-1) on total C and N concentrations and C: N ratio in leaves and inflorescences of medical cannabis plants were studied; and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of primary metabolites added to the analyses of secondary metabolites. Elevation of N supply resulted in an increase in total N and N-containing compounds (chlorophylls and most amino acids), and decreased total C and compounds that do not contain N, such as sugars (fructose, glucose, and xylose), and phosphates (phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate) in both inflorescences and leaves. In the inflorescences, the elevation of N input also decreased total cannabinoids, phenols, and flavonoids, that do not contain N. Integrating the metabolic datasets revealed positive correlations between C sources (fructose and glucose) and most of the cannabinoids and terpenoids; the latter were negatively correlated with N-compounds (most amino acids). Taken together, these results suggest that elevated N supply induce a metabolic shift in the inflorescences towards increased production of N-compounds via deflecting the C sources from the biologically active compounds. In addition, the cannabis leaf was found to be more sensitive than the inflorescence to N supply, presenting greater changes in primary metabolism and more coordinated metabolic associations. These findings highlight the importance of adequate and precise N nutrition for standardization of the therapeutic-metabolite profile and for preventing undesirable metabolic repartitioning in medical cannabis plants.																			0926-6690	1872-633X				OCT 15	2023	202								116969	10.1016/j.indcrop.2023.116969	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2023.116969		JUN 2023											WOS:001032878600001

Simulating the Response of Drought-Tolerant Maize Varieties to Nitrogen Application in Contrasting Environments in the Nigeria Savannas Using the APSIM Model	AGRONOMY-BASEL												This paper assessed the application of the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM)-maize module as a decision support tool for optimizing nitrogen application to determine yield and net return of maize production under current agricultural practices in the Nigeria savannas. The model was calibrated for two maize varieties using data from field experiments conducted under optimum conditions in three locations during the 2017 and 2018 cropping seasons. The model was evaluated using an independent dataset from an experiment conducted under different nitrogen (N) levels in two locations within Southern and Northern Guinea savannas. The results show that model accurately predicted days to 50% anthesis and physiological maturity, leaf area index (LAI), grain yield and total dry matter (TDM) of both varieties with low RMSE and RMSEn (%) values within the range of acceptable statistics indices. Based on 31-year seasonal simulation, optimum mean grain yield of 3941 kg ha(-1) for Abuja, and 4549 for Kano was simulated at N rate of 120 kg ha(-1) for the early maturing variety 2009EVDT. Meanwhile in Zaria, optimum mean yield of 4173 kg ha(-1) was simulated at N rate of 90 kg ha(-1). For the intermediate maturing variety, IWDC2SYNF2 mean optimum yields of 5152, 5462, and 4849 kg ha(-1), were simulated at N application of 120 kg ha(-1) for all the locations. The probability of exceeding attainable mean grain yield of 3000 and 4000 kg ha(-1) for 2009EVDT and IWDC2SYNF2, respectively would be expected in 95% of the years with application of 90 kg N ha(-1) across the three sites. Following the profitability scenarios analysis, the realistic net incomes of US$ 536 ha(-1) for Abuja, and US$ 657 ha(-1) for Zaria were estimated at N rate of 90 kg ha(-1) and at Kano site, realistic net income of US$ 720 ha(-1)was estimated at N rate of 120 kg ha(-1) for 2009EVDT.For IWDC2SYNF2, realistic net incomes of US$ 870, 974, and 818 ha(-1) were estimated at N application of 120 kg ha(-1) for Abuja, Zaria, and Kano respectively. The result of this study suggests that 90 kg N ha(-1) can be recommended for 2009EVDT and 120 kg N ha(-1) for IWDC2SYNF2 in Abuja and Zaria while in Kano, 120 kg N ha(-1) should be applied to both varieties to attain optimum yield and profit.

Rasoul; Bar-Shmuel, Nitsan; Segoli, Michal			The unique interaction between the summer annual desert plant <i>Salsola inermis</i> Forssk and weevils residing on its roots: mutualism or parasitism?	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. Herbivores and parasites are likely to impose less damage on their host when their growth rate is slow and their dependency on the host is high. Accordingly, it was hypothesised that evolution would favour neutral or even beneficial interactions between a below-ground herbivore and a plant during the harsh season in a desert ecosystem. 2. This study characterised the relationship between the summer annual plant Salsola inermis Forssk (Chenopodiaceae) and weevils developing in a mud chamber attached to its roots in the Negev Desert of Israel. Plant seedlings were exposed to adult weevils (Conorhynchus palumbus Olivier or Menecleonus virgatus Schoenherr; Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in a controlled outside setting, to induce oviposition and larval establishment. The following were quantified: plant growth, above-ground biomass, fruit biomass, and fruit size, as well as relative C and N contents, and isotopic signatures (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in plant tissues. 3. Exposure to weevils did not reduce plant survival but significantly and negatively affected plant growth and seed production. However, these effects were mainly due to above-ground herbivory by adults rather than root herbivory by larvae, and might have been overestimated. Interestingly, %N and delta N-15 were significantly higher, and the C:N ratio was significantly lower, in plants with larval establishment, suggesting that weevils affect the plant nitrogen budget. 4. The overall results do not support the notion of mutualistic interactions; yet, slow consumption, a low infestation level, and, possibly, N supplementation to the plant may enable the plant to tolerate herbivory under natural conditions.

J	Yun, SY; Zhang, X				Yun, Shiyu; Zhang, Xin			Genome-wide identification, characterization and expression analysis of AGO, DCL, and RDR families in <i>Chenopodium quinoa</i>	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												RNA interference is a highly conserved mechanism wherein several types of non-coding small RNAs regulate gene expression at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level, modulating plant growth, development, antiviral defence, and stress responses. Argonaute (AGO), DCL (Dicer-like), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) are key proteins in this process. Here, these three protein families were identified in Chenopodium quinoa. Further, their phylogenetic relationships with Arabidopsis, their domains, three-dimensional structure modelling, subcellular localization, and functional annotation and expression were analysed. Whole-genome sequence analysis predicted 21 CqAGO, eight CqDCL, and 11 CqRDR genes in quinoa. All three protein families clustered into phylogenetic clades corresponding to those of Arabidopsis, including three AGO clades, four DCL clades, and four RDR clades, suggesting evolutionary conservation. Domain and protein structure analyses of the three gene families showed almost complete homogeneity among members of the same group. Gene ontology annotation revealed that the predicted gene families might be directly involved in RNAi and other important pathways. Largely, these gene families showed significant tissue-specific expression patterns, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data revealed that 20 CqAGO, seven CqDCL, and ten CqRDR genes tended to have preferential expression in inflorescences. Most of them being downregulated in response to drought, cold, salt and low phosphate stress. To our knowledge, this is the first study to elucidate these key protein families involved in the RNAi pathway in quinoa, which are significant for understanding the mechanisms underlying stress responses in this plant.																			2045-2322					MAR 4	2023	13	1							3647	10.1038/s41598-023-30827-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-30827-1								36871121					WOS:000946670000019

Lorentz Violation by the Preferred Frame Effects and Cosmic and Gamma Ray Propagation	GALAXIES												The 'relativity with a preferred frame', designed to reconcile the relativity principle with the existence of the cosmological preferred frame, incorporates the preferred frame at the level of special relativity (SR) while retaining the fundamental spacetime symmetry, which, in the standard SR, manifests itself as Lorentz invariance. In this paper, the processes, accompanying the propagation of cosmic rays and gamma rays through the background radiation from distant sources to Earth, are considered on the basis of particle dynamics and electromagnetic field dynamics developed within the framework of the 'relativity with a preferred frame'. Applying the theory to the photopion-production and pair-production processes shows that the modified particle dynamics and electrodynamics lead to measurable signatures in the observed cosmic and gamma-ray spectra which can provide an interpretation of some puzzling features found in the observational data. Other processes responsible for gamma-ray attenuation are considered. It is found, in particular, that electromagnetic cascades, developing on cosmic microwave background and extragalactic background light, may be reduced or suppressed due to the preferred frame effects which should influence the shape of the very high-energy gamma-ray spectra. Other possible observational consequences of the theory, such as the birefringence of light propagating in vacuo and dispersion, are discussed.

J	Zhang, YJ; Yu, Q				Zhang, Yajie; Yu, Qiang			Does agroecosystem model improvement increase simulation accuracy for agricultural N<sub>2</sub>O emissions?	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												In recent decades, agroecosystem models have been developed to simulate agricultural nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Coefficients of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) are widely used as metrics to assess the explanatory power and simulation accuracy of models and to provide perspectives on model improvement as models evolve. This study aimed to determine whether the fitting accuracy of three agroecosystem models to simulate agricultural N2O emissions improved with advancing versions of the models. We used several quality evaluation criteria to extract 94 and 97 reported R-2 and RMSE values, respectively, from 32 published articles related to the use of three of the most-used agroecosystem models in the research field of N2O emissions [i.e., DNDC (DeNitrification-DeComposition), DayCent, and APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator)]. Results showed that there was (1) no significant improvement in simulating N2O emissions between DNDC9.3 and DNDC9.5; and (2) no significant difference between the simulation abilities of the original models and the user-defined revised models for these widely-used models. These findings may be mainly a result of the offsetting consequences of changes in publication bias and increased focus on complex agricultural issues. The study also found that the simulation accuracy of DNDC was better under conditions of higher annual mean temperature and soil bulk density and lower soil total nitrogen, mainly caused by the formulas and data used to build and validate the model. The study results suggest that the suitability of a model for simulating N2O emissions depends on the climatic and soil conditions at the location of its application. Improving the simulation accuracy of agroecosystem models will require further targeted corrective and development actions in the future.

J	Zhang, YJ; Yu, Q				Zhang, Yajie; Yu, Qiang			Identification of current research intensity and influence factors of agricultural nitrogen loss from cropping systems	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												A large number of studies related to agricultural nitrogen (N) losses have been conducted in recent decades worldwide. However, determining if specific N loss pathways are under-researched or overresearched for different country-crop combinations still remains uncertain. The objective of this study was to provide an estimate of crop-specific research deficits or excesses for global cropland ammonia volatilization, nitrous oxide emission, and N leaching from 2001 to 2015 from simulations with the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model and zero-inflated Poisson model integrated with bibliometric metrics (i.e., numbers of publications and researchers). In addition, some major influencing factors affecting cropland N loss patterns were also evaluated. Our analysis showed that corn, wheat, rice, and legumes have received substantially more research focus than other crops due to their greater N losses. Greater amounts of research were always evident in China, the United States, and Australia for cereals; in China, India, the United States, and Japan for rice; and in the United States, Brazil, China, Argentina, and India for legumes. These countries are major crop producers that spend large monetary sums on research and development. Some country-crop combinations, such as millet across the globe, cassava and sorghum in tropical countries, and legumes in Europe, show greater research deficits due to the lower level of economic development or due to agricultural policies in the countries where these crops are produced. Tillage method is sometimes considered the most sensitive driver for various N loss pathways. However, the amount of tillage research tended to be slightly lower than research on climate factors and fertilization. Our results support the urgent need for prioritizing the allocation of agricultural research focus and resources not only with regard to country-crop combinations but also with respect to measures for mitigating N loss in order to enhance environmental and agricultural sustainability.

The following study was conducted to determine the soil heavy metal contents under different types of land use, contamination levels, and the physicochemical properties of soil. Soil samples were collected from facility lands, orchards, farmlands, and grasslands at 0-10 and 10-20 cm soil layers. Heavy metals including copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), and mercury (Hg) were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and the soil was evaluated with different methods. Overall, the average Cu (25.07 mg/kg), Cr (45.67 mg/kg), Ni (25.56 mg/kg), Zn (71.24 mg/kg), Pb (14.19 mg/kg), Cd (0.17 mg/kg), As (12.54 mg/kg), and Hg (0.05 mg/kg) were lower than the environmental quality standard. However, the Cu, Cr, Ni, and As were highest in farmland, and Zn and Hg were highest in the facility land. The Pb content was highest in orchards, and the Cd content was the same in facility land, orchards, and farmland. Among the different land-use types, the soil heavy metal concentrations decreased in the order of facility land > farmland > grassland > orchards. The pH was alkaline, the content of SOC (soil organic carbon) 15.76 g/kg in grassland, TN (total nitrogen) 1.43 g/kg, and TP (total phosphorus) 0.97 g/kg in facility land showed the highest result. The soil BD (bulk density) had a significant positive correlation with Cu, Cr, Ni, Zn, Pb, Cd, and the TP positively correlated with Cu, Zn, Cd, and Hg. The soil evaluation results of the comprehensive pollution index indicated that the soil was in a clean condition. The index of potential environmental risk indicates that heavy metals are slightly harmful to the soil.

Soil erosion is a primary factor that affects the spatial distribution of the soil prokaryotic community, but how soil prokaryotes in soil-eroding catena respond to environmental factors related to topography remains largely unclear. In this study, topsoils were sampled from three typical erosion geomorphic units (autonomous, transitional and depositional zones) in 2018 to identify the soil prokaryotic community and interactions among the species on the Chinese Loess Plateau. The alpha-diversity was greater but the betadiversity was lower in the autonomous and transitional zones than in the depositional zone. Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were 73% and 68% lower in the autonomous and transitional zones than in the depositional zone. In addition, Deltaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes and Nitrospirae were significantly higher in the autonomous and transitional zones. A less clustered network and fewer co-occurrences within the prokaryotic community and functional groups of processes were found in the depositional zone than in the autonomous and transitional zones. The alpha-diversity index was significantly negatively correlated with clay particles, soil water content, soil organic carbon (SOC), and ratio of SOC and nitrogen (C/N) but positively correlated with total nitrogen (TN). The higher relative abundances of copiotrophic groups (including Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, etc.) in the depositional zone was mainly due to the increased SOC caused by the deposition of SOC-rich clay. Reassembly of the soil physico-chemistry characteristics among the topographic units significantly altered the soil prokaryotic community along the soil-eroding catena.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				MAR	2021	198								105035	10.1016/j.catena.2020.105035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.105035		JAN 2021											WOS:000605337000054

Uncertainty regarding carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) sequestration and their dynamics after land-use change hampers an accurate understanding of the C and N cycles. To address the influence of converting agricultural land to forest on organic carbon (OC) and N sequestration and their coupling relationships, we collected topsoil (0 - 10 cm depth) and subsurface soil (10 - 20 cm depth) in afforested woodlands 10, 20, and 35 yrs after the establishment of Robinia pseudoacacia in abandoned farmlands on the Loess Plateau, China. We analyzed the concentrations and stocks of OC and N in bulk soils and water-stable aggregates. We found that afforestation of farmland resulted in a relative increase of 30 % in the proportion of macroaggregates (8 - 0.25 mm) but a relative decrease of 45 % and 30 % in the proportions of microaggregates (0.25 - 0.053 mm) and silt + clay (< 0.053 mm), respectively. The respective OC and N stocks increased by 87 % and 74 % in bulk soils and by 278 % and 159 % in macroaggregates after 35 yrs of afforestation. Macroaggregates accounted for 69 % and 68 % of the OC and N stocks, respectively, in bulk soils at the 0 - 20 cm depth. However, the OC and N stocks in microaggregates and silt + clay were only slightly affected. These results indicated that the conversion of agricultural land to forest could sequester OC and N in both bulk soils and aggregates, mainly macroaggregates. In addition, the dynamics of OC and N were significantly correlated, implying synchronous OC and N sequestration in soils after converting agricultural land to forest.

This study was conducted to investigate the quantitative genetic basis of yield, yield components, and quality-related traits of salinity-stressed melon (Cucumis melo L.) using 55 melon hybrids and their 11 parents (half diallel). The results of combined ANOVA revealed highly significant effects of salinity and genotype on all the traits studied. Salinity stress influenced the inheritance of all the traits. The lower values of variance components (mainly additive), GCA/SCA ratio, as well as broad-and narrow-sense heritabilities were estimated for saline conditions (ECw= 14 dSm(-1)) when compared with those obtained under non-saline conditions. Fruit weight was governed by additive effects in non-saline conditions, but largely governed by the dominant nature in saline conditions. Based on the results obtained, especially as reflected by fruit yield, it is possible to develop melon hybrids with higher salinity tolerance than is currently observed in tolerant cultivars. On the other hand, most of the traits contributing to fruit quality are found to be governed by additive effects, allowing for their further improvement through recurrent selection to develop new cultivars of high yield and good quality for cultivation under saline conditions.

J.; Tielboerger, Katja; Seifan, Merav			Equivocal evidence for a change in balance between selfing and pollinator-mediated reproduction in annual Brassicaceae growing along a rainfall gradient	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION												Because many plants ensure their reproductive success using some level of self-fertilization, it is predicted that the balance between pollinator-mediated pollen transfer and autonomous selfing will be correlated with habitat harshness and pollinator activity. To study these correlations, we used three annual species that differ in their self-incompatibility and compared their reproductive success in the form of fruit production and seed viability, with and without pollinators, along a rainfall gradient and in relation to pollinator activity. We found that pollinator activity decreased with increasing aridity. Although the reproductive success in the absence of pollinators fitted the species' level of self-incompatibility, no clear trend was detected between pollinator visits or site harshness and relative reproductive success. Only one of the species, Sinapis alba, showed a consistent increase in autonomous selfing with both increased aridity and decreased pollinator visits, a finding that was supported by an increase in the viability of seeds produced in the absence of pollinators. Nevertheless, unlike our prediction, the absolute number of seeds produced per S. alba flower increased with aridity. Our overall findings suggest that despite decreasing pollinator abundance and diversity with increasing aridity, the reproductive success of annual species, even of those with high self-incompatibility, remains relatively high. Although there may be several mechanisms governing these results, the overall constant seed production despite environmental uncertainties may be part of the mechanism by which plants in arid ecosystems buffer environmental variations.

What's more, the doping of Si-Mg jointly promoted the excellent physicochemical properties of the material, e.g., high specific surface area, good pore volume, and numerous oxygen-containing groups. The Cd2+ batch adsorption experiments proved that SLCs have good Cd2+ removal capacity within pH 3-7, and the adsorption model demonstrated the adsorption process as a physicochemically complex process. The maximum adsorption of Cd2+ in the SLC was 665.35 mg/g, and the contributing factors to the removal of Cd2+ were as follows: ion exchange (59.36 %) > Cd2+ precipitation (24.93 %) > oxygen-containing functional group complexation (14.79 %) > Cd2+-pi interactions (0.92 %). In addition, the complexation of Si-O, Mg-O, and Cd precipitates allowed the formation of a three-dimensional fiber mesh structure. The application of SLCs has the potential to eliminate Cd2+ pollution in water bodies, and its prepa-ration is simple and environmentally friendly. Finally, this study provides a theoretical basis for an in-depth understanding of the mechanism of heavy metal adsorption by inorganic nonmetals in combination with metal oxides.					li, jiaxin/JNT-5073-2023														0141-8130	1879-0003				FEB 28	2023	229						62	69		10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.12.274	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.12.274		DEC 2022						36587637					WOS:000914658500001

The establishment of high-yield maize (Zea mays L.) population under FM is built on robust plant development and indispensable soil support that generally started from the seedling stage. However, there is still a lack of information on the root-shoot development of maize seedling under FM. A 2-yr field experiment was performed in rainfed plots of Loess Plateau experimental station to study the effects of FM on root-shoot growth of maize seedlings. Root samples were harvested from different soil layers until max rooting depth at V3 and V6 stages to detail the vertical development. Our results implied that FM significantly improved soil hydrothermal conditions and canopy development at V3 and V6 stages. At the V3 stage, there was no significant difference in root biomass between treatments or growth seasons, but root length under FM treatment was decreased by about 17%; moreover, ridge-furrow without mulching (CK) treatment intended to distribute 4-9% more root biomass in deeper soil layers, and the root biomass per unit length under FM treatment was increased. At the V6 stage, FM brought about significant advantages in root biomass and length. Nonetheless, maize seedlings under FM treatment had a consistently lower root/shoot ratio, higher root efficiency, and higher water use efficiency during the V3-V6 period. In conclusion, FM helped rainfed maize seedlings run a lightweight but high-efficiency root to support its productive shoot since the very beginning.

We assessed the temporal changes in runoff and sediment load at both the annual and event scales in the Gushanchuan watershed in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. A total of 330 events, from 1955 to 2018, were selected to evaluate the relationships between rainfall, runoff, and suspended sediment load at the Gaoshiya gauging station. Significant reductions were examined in the maximum runoff peaks, suspended sediment concentration, total runoff, suspended sediment yield, and ratio of event runoff to annual total, whereas the ratio of event sediment yield to annual total remained relatively stable. Hysteresis analysis suggested that the complex loops, anti-clockwise, and figure-eight loops accounted for 93.7% of the total events in the watershed. High positive correlations were observed between the flood-event sediment yield, runoff volume, maximum runoff peaks, and total rainfall amount. The flow-sediment relationship can be well fitted by the proportional model, and was weaker in 1997-2018 than those in the periods of 1955-1979 and 1980-1996. Runoff during the rising limb of the event significantly contributed to the total runoff and sediment yield. Land use changes and various soil conservation practices were responsible for the decrease in the flood frequency and magnitude. The results of this study provide useful insights into the relationships between rainfall, runoff, and suspended sediment dynamics, and their responses to soil conservation practices.

However, planted seedlings suffer high levels of mortality in arid climates. Biochar can enhance seedling survival and growth. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect of biochar (derived from Vachellia etbaica) on the survival of V. etbaica and Faidherbia albida seedlings. We planted V. etbaica and F. albida into soil treated with 1 kg of biochar per seedling and into soil without biochar (control) using a randomized complete block design. We analyzed the soil nutrients, plant growth, and plant elements. The application of biochar did not increase the nutrient levels in the soil. However, the total dry mass of V. etbaica and F. albida increased following biochar application. Moreover, the total contents of several nutrients were higher in the leaves of biochar-treated V. etbaica and leaves and roots of biochar-treated F. albida than in the controls. These results suggest that biochar can alter the chemical properties of soil, resulting in the accelerated uptake of nutrients. In conclusion, the application of biochar enhances the uptake of nutrients, thereby enhancing the growth of V. etbaica and F. albida.					birhane, emiru/JBJ-0779-2023	birhane, emiru/0000-0002-8644-5961													0021-3551						2021	55	4					367	378																WOS:000708226700009

Determining the key features of high-impact agronomic journals will be a central component for identifying the disciplinary development in the field of agronomy. In this study, we conducted a bibliometric study to fill this knowledge gap based on 64,703 articles published in 18 main agronomy journals since 1948 derived from the Scopus database. Our main findings were that (a) over 20% of publications in Advances in Agronomy and Agricultural and Forest Meteorology received more than 50 citations; (b) authors from the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia published the most articles in these journals, comprising 22.4, 11.5, 10.7, 8.7, and 8.0% of the total number of publications, respectively; and (c) journals published in a given country had a greater number of papers published by authors of that country than by authors of other countries. Furthermore, three clusters for these 18 journals were identified that included the topics of agronomy, interactions between agronomy and soil sciences, and interactions between agronomy and plant sciences. The results of this study provide valuable insights regarding the current state of and future development trends in agronomic journals.

However, current studies on methods for evaluating the impact of soil interparticle forces in aggregate stability are scarce. This research was aimed to examine the impact of soil interparticle forces on aggregate stability using diverse methods for different soil types. Soil aggregate stability was tested through the pipette method, wet sieving, and rainfall simulation, respectively characterized by aggregate stability index (ASI), mean weight diameter (MWD), and splash erosion mass (SE). Soil interparticle forces were adjusted by the changing concentrations of NaCl solution. The results showed that all three approaches can be applied to study the impact of soil interparticle forces on aggregate stability. The ASI, MWD, and SE showed little change below 10(-2) mol L-1 NaCl concentration and then ASI and MWD increased at a high rate above 10(-2) mol L-1 concentration of NaCl, while the SE showed the opposite trend. These results were as expected for soil interparticle forces. Moreover, for a single soil, a substantial correlation existed between the aggregate stability indicators obtained from three methods. However, the order of soil aggregate stability, measured by three methods were varied among soil types. Our results suggest that a single method cannot be applied to determine the aggregate stability of all soil types even if the breakdown mechanism was identical, because organic matter content and particle size distribution of soil are important factors influencing aggregate stability. Hence, in order to compare the difference in aggregate stability between various soils, multiple methods should be considered to investigate the impact of interparticle forces of soil on its aggregate stability. If a single method was to be chosen, wet sieving may be a good choice as it was not only relatively simple and time-saving but also reflected more comprehensive information about sizes and amount of fragments released from soil aggregates.

J	Ma, RT; Hu, FN; Xu, CY; Liu, JF; Zhao, SW				Ma, Rentian; Hu, Feinan; Xu, Chenyang; Liu, Jingfang; Zhao, Shiwei			Response of soil aggregate stability and splash erosion to different breakdown mechanisms along natural vegetation restoration	CATENA												Vegetation restoration may effectively improve aggregate stability and reduce soil erosion by increasing soil organic matter (SOM). Soil internal and raindrop impact forces are the main breakdown mechanisms of soil aggregates, and the main erosive factors that generate splash erosion. However, it remains unclear about how these forces affect the aggregate stability and the splash erosion during natural vegetation restoration. In this study, four soils at different succession stages (farmland, grassland, shrub, and forest) were selected. Deionized water and ethanol were employed to evaluate the effect of soil internal and raindrop impact forces on aggregate stability and splash erosion during vegetation restoration, by performing fast-wetting test and simulated rainfall experiment. Deionized water was used to simulate the combined effects of soil internal and raindrop impact forces, whereas ethanol was used to simulate the sole effect of raindrop impact force. The results indicated that soil organic matter (SOM) content, cation exchange capacity (CEC), specific surface area (SSA), and soil aggregate stability for the four soils increased with revegetation. The soil aggregate stability in deionized water test (MWDW) was lower than these in ethanol test (MWDE), and the relative difference of the MWD (R-MWD) decreased with revegetation. Besides, the splash erosion rate in deionized water test (S-W) was much higher than those in ethanol test (S-E). S-W and S-E decreased with the order of grassland < shrub < forest. With the increasing rainfall kinetic energy, splash erosion rates increased in both deionized water and ethanol tests; but the contribution rates of soil internal forces to rainfall splash erosion decreased. The overall results suggested that the process of vegetation restoration altered soil particle surface properties mainly due to the increase SOM, and decreased the net repulsive internal forces, which thereby improved aggregate stability and erosion resistance with revegetation.

J	Wang, Y; Ji, HF; Wang, R; Guo, SL				Wang, Ying; Ji, Hongfei; Wang, Rui; Guo, Shengli			Responses of nitrification and denitrification to nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization: does the intrinsic soil fertility matter?	PLANT AND SOIL												Aims Nitrogen (N) is not only a major regulator of productivity in terrestrial systems but can also be a pollutant. While the effects of fertilizer addition to soil N cycling processes and the associated soil microbial groups have been extensively studied, little attention has been paid to the interaction of fertilizer amendment and the intrinsic fertility of the soil. Methods We conducted a filed study on the Chinese Loess Plateau with soils of two fertility levels (low fertility and high fertility), amended with or without synthetic fertilizer (N and phosphorus, NP). Soil samples were collected three times in a continuous winter wheat cropping system and analyzed for soil potential nitrification (PNA) and denitrification (DEA) rates, nitrifiers and denitrifiers. Results Populations of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) and the resulting PNA were increased by the NP application regardless of intrinsic soil fertility. The NP application increased DEA by 15-228% in the low fertility soil, but decreased DEA by 18-46% in the high fertility soil. Soil denitrifiers also showed divergent responses to NP application in low and high fertility soils, i.e., the abundance of nirS-nitrite reducers increased in the low fertility soil, while nirS- and nirK-nitrite reducers were unchanged in the high fertility soil. The narG-nitrate reducers, AOB and AOA were more responsive to the NP application in the tillering stage (BBCH 25-26) than in other periods, whereas PNA, DEA and denitrifier gene abundance (nirS and nirK) varied more in the flowering stage (BBCH 65). Conclusions Our results suggest that the responses of soil nitrification/nitrifiers and denitrification/denitrifiers to NP application varied with intrinsic soil fertility levels. The contrasting responses of nitrification and denitrification to NP application in high fertility soil indicate a decoupling of both processes.																			0032-079X	1573-5036				JUL	2019	440	1-2					443	456		10.1007/s11104-019-04108-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-019-04108-8													WOS:000475977600031

The aim of the present study was to investigate the ions balance and their relationship to metabolites in P. communis under three salinity stress conditions. Results showed that the contents of Na Cl, and SO42- significantly increased in P. communis leaves, while K+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ decreased. Moreover, Na+ and Cl- had significant negative correlations with metabolites involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), and significant positive correlations with glycolysis. The metabolite results showed that high contents of sugars and proline played important roles in developing salinity tolerance, indicating that glycolysis and proline biosynthesis were enhanced; however, this consumes large amounts of energy and likely caused the TCA cycle to be inhibited. The results suggested that P. conununis might enhance its salinity tolerance mainly through increased glycolysis and energy consumption. In addition, restricting NA(+) accumulation and increasing of Cl-, and rearrangement of metabolite production in P. communis tissues are possible causes of salinity tolerance. Therefore, salinity caused systems alterations in widespread metabolic networks involving TCA cycle, glycolysis and proline biosynthesis. These findings provided new insights for the P. conununis metabolic adaptation to salinity and demonstrated the ions balance and metabolites in P. communis are possibly attributable to development of salinity tolerance.																			0981-9428	1873-2690				JUN	2019	139						651	659		10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.04.027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.04.027								31048122					WOS:000469896200068

Soil surface electrochemical properties, including specific surface area, cation exchange capacity, surface charge density, surface electric field strength, and surface potential, are often used as indicators to evaluate agricultural soil quality and fertility. However, little attention has been payed to the effect of natural revegetation on soil surface electrochemical properties. In this work, we selected a grassland restoration chronosequence (slope cropland, 0 years; natural grasslands restored for 3, 8, 22 and 24 years, i.e. NR3, NR8, NR22 and NR24, respectively) to investigate the changes of soil surface electrochemical properties along with vegetative restoration. Our results showed that surface charge density and surface potential for restored grassland ranged from 0.16 to 0.20 C and from -94 to -109 mV, with an average of 0.18 C m(-2) and -101 mV, respectively. The value of surface electric field strength could reach to the order of magnitude of -10(7) V m(-1) and showed a decreasing trend with increasing period of natural vegetation recovery. Cation exchange capacity and specific surface area significantly increased with the extension of natural restoration period except for NR3 (P < 0.05). It was found that soil organic matter (SOM) and silt content were the main factors to determine cation exchange capacity and specific surface area. Both cation exchange capacity and specific surface area were closely related to silt content but weakly related to clay content, possibly due to the high silt content in our studied soils. Moreover, cation exchange capacity and specific surface area showed a significant linear relationship with SOM, which may be ascribed to the diversity in cation substitution sites and high specific surface area of SOM. Our results indicated that the long-term natural restoration of grassland contributed to the improvement of cation exchange capacity and specific surface area.

Problems such as near-color background interference, branch and leaf occlusion of fruits, and target scale diversity in greenhouse environments posed higher requirements for cucumber target detection algorithms. Therefore, a lightweight YOLOv5s-Super model was proposed based on the YOLOv5s model. First, in this study, the bidirectional feature pyramid network (BiFPN) and C3CA module were added to the YOLOv5s-Super model with the goal of capturing cucumber shoulder features of long-distance dependence and dynamically fusing multi-scale features in the near-color background. Second, the Ghost module was added to the YOLOv5s-Super model to speed up the inference time and floating-point computation speed of the model. Finally, this study visualized different feature fusion methods for the BiFPN module; independently designed a C3SimAM module for comparison between parametric and non-parametric attention mechanisms. The results showed that the YOLOv5s-Super model achieves mAP of 87.5%, which was 4.2% higher than the YOLOv7-tiny and 1.9% higher than the YOLOv8s model. The improved model could more accurately and robustly complete the detection of multi-scale features in complex near-color backgrounds while the model met the requirement of being lightweight. These results could provide technical support for the implementation of intelligent cucumber picking.					yang, rui/JHI-3328-2023; Wang, Jiacheng/ABE-5948-2020; jiang, lei/IWE-1124-2023															2073-4395				AUG	2023	13	8							2062	10.3390/agronomy13082062	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13082062													WOS:001057160800001
J	Wang, H; Fan, J; Fu, W				Wang, Huan; Fan, Jun; Fu, Wei			Effect of Activated Water Irrigation on the Yield and Water Use Efficiency of Winter Wheat under Irrigation Deficit	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Activated water irrigation has been widely investigated as an effective production increasing measure. However, the response of activated water irrigation in plant growth and water use efficiency (WUE) with the irrigation amount is not well understood. Here, a pot experiment was conducted to determine the effects of activated water irrigation on winter wheat growth, yield, and WUE under irrigation amount. Twelve treatments included four irrigation water types, (i) tap water (TW), (ii) tap water with magnetization (MW), (iii) tap water with oxygenation (OW), (iv) tap water with magnetization and oxygenation (M&OW), and three irrigation amounts, (1) 80% of the field capacity (FC), (2) 65%FC, and (3) 50%FC. The results indicated that activated water irrigation improved the plant height, leaf area, aboveground biomass, and photosynthetic characteristics at each growth stage of winter wheat. However, the yield and WUE varied with water type and irrigation amount. With 80%FC, the yield and WUE of MW were significantly greater by 35.7% and 53.9% than TW. The yield and WUE of OW were greater by 11.4% and 23.1% than TW. With 65%FC, the yield of MW, OW, and M&OW were greater by 43.9%, 46.3%, and 14.6% than TW, respectively. WUE of MW, OW, and M&OW were greater by 37.0%, 37.0%, and 11.1% than TW, respectively. With 50%FC, the yield of OW and M&OW were significantly greater by 77.3% and 122.7% than TW. WUE of OW and M&OW were significantly greater by 41.4% and 75.9% than TW (p < 0.05). Overall, the research provides clear evidence that OW is an effective way to increase yield and WUE, MW and M&OW should be applied in suitable soil water conditions.																				2073-4395				JUN	2022	12	6							1315	10.3390/agronomy12061315	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12061315													WOS:000818289700001
J	Fang, Z; Ke, ZM; Jiao, F				Fang, Zhao; Ke, Zengming; Jiao, Feng			Community density of grassland effect on soil carbon dynamics: Field survey and analyses from a 45-year natural recovery time-sequence on the Loess Plateau, China	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Community density of grassland has obvious impacts on the absorption, sequestration, and accumulation of soil carbon (C). However, few studies have examined the effect of community density on soil C dynamics and their internal driving forces after cropland abandonment. Here, we synthesized the responses of soil C to community density of grassland over a 45-year time-sequence along a natural restoration time sequence. The results showed that the soil C content during the late-successional period was greater than that during the early-successional period, that is, annual C storage rates for the first sequence (1-15 years) for the 0-60 cm depth profiles were -0.34, -0.27, -0.15 to 0.02 Mg-C ha(-1) yr(-1), in the <= 10, 11-20, 21-30, and >30 community densities. And the third sequence (31-45 years) presented values that were 79.28% and 44.60% greater than those of the initial stage of vegetation restoration (CK) for the 0-20 and 0-60 cm profiles, respectively. The increased soil C storage rates of the late-successional sequence were associated with both increased aboveground production and root biomass for this sequence and the presence of multiple species, especially Leguminosae and Gramineae species, with developed roots. Overall, the effects of community density on soil C were regulated by the recovery time, root mass, and species genera. Furthermore, our results suggest that soil may still be a carbon source even after 15 years of the abandonment restoring, and high community density may greatly increase C capture and storage rates in abandoned lands. The findings enhance the understanding of soil C sequestration and accumulation responses to community density following long-term natural vegetation succession, providing support for estimating and predicting the regional C budget and global C cycle.					方, 昭/Q-1197-2016	方, 昭/0000-0001-9276-3096; Jiao, Feng/0000-0002-3169-4856													1085-3278	1099-145X				DEC	2021	32	18					5216	5226		10.1002/ldr.4103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4103		NOV 2021											WOS:000716191900001
J	Burde, GI				Burde, Georgy I.			Particle dynamics and GZK limit in relativity with a preferred frame	ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS												The theory termed 'special relativity (SR) with a preferred frame' incorporates the preferred frame into special relativity while retaining the fundamental space-time symmetry which, in the standard SR, manifests itself as Lorentz invariance. In this paper, the theory is extended to particle dynamics based on the concept of the 'modified spacetime symmetry' which allows to develop the theory along the lines of the standard relativity theory. The modified relativistic dynamics is applied to describing the interactions of the Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) with universal diffuse background radiation and, in particular, to calculating the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) threshold for the energy suppression due to pion photoproduction by UHECR protons. The result, that the GZK cutoff energy depends on the distance (cosmological redshift z ) to the source of particles, may contribute to interpretation of the data on the mass composition of UHECR.

Srinivasa			Management of drought in <i>sali</i> rice under increasing rainfall variability in the North Bank Plains Zone of Assam, North East India	CLIMATIC CHANGE												The intermittent dry spells during growing season of winter or sali rice, cultivated in NBPZ of Assam located in the foothills of Eastern Himalayan region, is a major weather risk causing widespread damage to the crop. Herein, variability of rainfall in Lakhimpur district situated in NBPZ was studied. A significant decreasing trend of annual and seasonal rainfall was observed. Significant decrease in monsoon rainfall and increase in monthly rainfall variability clearly explains the recent rainfall fluctuations with increasing frequency of intermittent dry spells and flash floods. A participatory evaluation trial was conducted in Chamua village of Lakhimpur district having different land situations to identify climate resilient technologies to cope with seasonal drought in sali rice. High-yielding short-duration varieties, viz., Dishang, Luit, Lachit and Kolong, and medium-duration varieties, viz., Basundhara, Mohan, Mulagabhoru and TTB-404 performed consistently better than the long-duration HYV or the traditional varieties under upland and medium land situations, respectively. Though the effect of dry spells on long-duration varieties cultivated on low lands was least, yield of these varieties reduced up to 43.07% when sowing was delayed beyond 23rd of June. Performance of the delayed sown varieties was further declined, when exposed to dry spells at later growth stages. However, adverse impact of dry spells can be managed effectively by replacing farmers' varieties with short and medium-duration high-yielding varieties in upland and medium lands, respectively, and manipulating sowing time of long-duration varieties for low lands.

Biochar is often co-applied with nitrogen (N) fertilizers in agricultural ecosystems, however, the interactive effects of biochar and N addition (BN) on soil greenhouse gases (GHGs) fluxes, soil C and N fractions, and yield has not been investigated. Here, we manipulated a global meta-analysis to explore the effects of biochar and N addition and their interaction on the GHGs, soil C and N fractions, and yield by assembling 75 articles. Results indicate that across all studies, biochar, N, and BN additions all increased soil CO2 emissions (8.5%-29.6%), yield (4.2%-58.2%), soil organic C (SOC, 1.8%-50.4%), dissolved organic C (DOC, 2.7%-30.0%), and total N (TN, 6.8%-15.6%), but had no significant effect on CH4 fluxes. Biochar addition reduced N2O emissions (-21.3%), global warming potential (GWP, -19.8%), greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI, -28.2%), NH4 (+) (-17.8%) and NO3 (-) (-10.7%), whereas N addition increased these indexes. The interaction effects of BN on CO2 and N2O emissions, GWP, TN, and NH4 (+) contents were antagonistic, while CH4 emissions, DOC, MBC, NO3 (-), and yield exhibited synergistic responses. Notably, soil GHGs responses varied depending on geo-climatic factors, edaphic properties, biochar and N treatment parameters, and experimental scenarios. These findings indicate that the co-addition of biochar and N has the potential to mitigate climate change and improve yield, providing a valuable reference for the improvement of climate-smart agriculture.					贾, 晓宇/AHB-0724-2022; Yan, Weiming/CAG-9069-2022	贾, 晓宇/0000-0001-6011-1472; Yan, Weiming/0000-0001-5509-0806														2296-665X				MAR 17	2023	11								1123897	10.3389/fenvs.2023.1123897	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1123897													WOS:000961729300001

However, it is unclear whether N addition has variable effects on greenhouse gas (GHG) emission in rhizosphere soil. We performed N addition (0-9 g N m(-2) y(-1)) experiment in a Pinus tabulaeformis forest and a lab-incubation experiment to determine the effects of N addition on carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4) emissions in rhizosphere soils of roots with different diameters (very fine roots: <0.5 mm, intermediate fine roots: 0.5-1.0 mm, largest fine roots: 1.0-2.0 mm). Nitrogen addition significantly promoted CO2 emission and CH4 uptake, with maximum values (CO2, 623.15 mg C kg soil(-1); CH4, 1794.49 mu g degrees C kg soil(-1)) in the 6 or 9 g N m(-2) y(-1) treatments (P < 0.05). Nitrous oxide emissions were inhibited, with the greatest inhibitory effect in the 9 g N m(-2) y(-1) treatment (48.63 mu g N kg soil(-1)). Total phosphorus (TP) content significantly decreased and increased in rhizosphere soil and non-rhizosphere soil after N addition, respectively, while organic carbon (OC), total N (TN), ammonium (NH4+), and nitrate (NO3-) contents in rhizosphere soil increased. A greater change in chemical properties occurred in rhizosphere soil of largest fine roots than very fine roots. Carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions in rhizosphere soil among root sizes exhibited similar responses to N addition. While CH4 uptake was more responsive to N addition in rhizosphere soil with very fine roots than with largest fine roots. Basically, OC, TN, NO3-, and NH4+ were key soil components driving GHG emissions; NO3- promoted CH4 uptake and N2O emissions, NH4+ inhibited CO2 emissions. GHG response to N addition varied greatly, particularly in rhizosphere soil with different root sizes mainly related to its chemical properties. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Priority areas for restoring ecosystem services to enhance human well-being in a dry forest	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Habitat destruction reduces biodiversity and affects ecosystem functioning, putting at risk the provision of ecosystem services (ESs) essential for human well-being. Ecological restoration using native species with multiple uses may offer a long-term supply of natural resources for vulnerable human populations. We selected priority areas for restoration in the Brazilian Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest (Caatinga), targeting areas with high ES demand but low supply. We estimated the supply and demand for three ESs: (1) food/medicine, (2) wood production, and (3) pollination. We estimated ES supply using maps of the potential geographical distribution of 194 native plant species used by the local population as a means of livelihood. For ES demand, we used maps of population density, rural municipalities, wood productivity, and crops dependent on pollination. We used a large-scale prioritization tool (Zonation) to select two scenarios for each ES: (1) ES supply-only and (2) ES supply + ES demand, selecting only nonvegetated areas. To select priority areas, where the potential occurrence of species (ES supply) corresponds to areas of high demand for the same services, we overlapped the maps of the two scenarios for each ES. The highest percentage of scenario overlap occurred for food/medicine ES (45%), whereas pollination showed the lowest percentage of overlap (10%), indicating little similarity between potential ES supply and demand areas. Our study shows the importance of including ES in ecological restoration opportunities, taking into account the vulnerable human population in dry regions and their demand for natural resources.

We subjected Syzygium aromaticum to different degrees of drought treatments for three years, followed by short-term and high-intensity drought stress, and then re-irrigation to explore the influence of anatomical structures on hydraulic function. We found that vessel area, vessel diameter, and pit membrane area (APM) of intervessel pits significantly reduced after long-duration severe drought stress, while the APM of vessel-to-fiber pits increased. These variations had a strong effect on hydraulic conductivity and embolism. Drought-adapted plants had higher embolism resistance when exposed to short-term and high-intensity drought stress. Unexpectedly, under extreme drought stress, some exudations presented on the vessel-to-fiber pit membrane, and the aperture area of intervessel pits and vessel-to-fiber pits in each organ decreased by 29-44% and 0.7-30%, respectively. Pit membrane and aperture, especially the intervessel pits, were associated with hydraulic efficiency and embolism resistance under different drought conditions and re-irrigation. These findings suggest that the intervessel pits have a substantial impact on hydraulic function, and the fibers around vessels also play an essential role in embolism resistance. Our study makes an addition to the developing knowledge on xylem plasticity, vessel traits, and their effect on hydraulic function.

This model improves upon YOLOv8s by using GhostNet as its backbone for extracting features of the "Yuluxiang" pears. Additionally, an EMA attention mechanism was added before fusing each feature in the neck section to make the model focus more on the target information of "Yuluxiang" pear fruits, thereby improving target recognition ability and localization accuracy. Furthermore, the CIoU Loss was replaced with the WIoUv3 Loss as the loss function, which enhances the capability of bounding box fitting and improves model performance without increasing its size. Experimental results demonstrated that the enhanced YOLO-GEW achieves an F1 score of 84.47% and an AP of 88.83%, while only occupying 65.50% of the size of YOLOv8s. Compared to lightweight algorithms such as YOLOv8s, YOLOv7-Tiny, YOLOv6s, YOLOv5s, YOLOv4-Tiny, and YOLOv3-Tiny; there are improvements in AP by 2.32%, 1.51%, 2.95%, 2.06%, 2.92%, and 5.38% respectively. This improved model can efficiently detect "Yuluxiang" pears in non-structural environments in real-time and provides a theoretical basis for recognition systems used by picking robots.

Most of the seed and pollinator parents clustered into two clear-cut separate groups based on marker based genetic distance. Significant variations were found for forage related morphological traits at different cutting intervals (first and second cut) in hybrid parents. Across two cuts, crude protein (CP) varied from 11% to 15%, while in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) varied from 51% to 56%. Eighty hybrids evaluated in multi-location trial along with their parents for forage traits showed that significant heterosis can be realized for forage traits. A low but positive significant correlation found between SSR based genetic distance (GD between parents of hybrid) and heterosis for most of the forage traits indicated that SSR-based GD can be used for predicting heterosis for GFY, DFY and CP in pearl millet. An attempt was made to associate marker-based clusters with forage quality traits, to enable breeders select parents for crossing purposes in forage breeding programs.

Besides ABal, plants generate other aldehydes that can be toxic above a certain threshold. AAO3 knockout mutants (aao3) exhibited earlier senescence but equivalent relative water content compared with wild-type (WT) during normal growth or upon application of UV-C irradiation. Aldehyde profiling in leaves of 24-day-old plants revealed higher accumulation of acrolein, crotonaldehyde, 3Z-hexenal, hexanal and acetaldehyde in aao3 mutants compared with WT leaves. Similarly, higher levels of acrolein, benzaldehyde, crotonaldehyde, propionaldehyde, trans-2-hexenal and acetaldehyde were accumulated in aao3 mutants upon UV-C irradiation. Aldehydes application to plants hastened profuse senescence symptoms and higher accumulation of aldehydes, such as acrolein, benzaldehyde and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, in aao3 mutant leaves as compared with WT. The senescence symptoms included greater decrease in chlorophyll content and increase in transcript expression of the early senescence marker genes, Senescence-Related-Gene1, Stay-Green-Protein2 as well as NAC-LIKE, ACTIVATED-BY AP3/P1. Notably, although aao3 had lower ABA content than WT, members of the ABA-responding genes SnRKs were expressed at similar levels in aao3 and WT. Moreover, the other ABA-deficient mutants [aba2 and 9-cis-poxycarotenoid dioxygenase3-2 (nced3-2), that has functional AAO3] exhibited similar aldehydes accumulation and chlorophyll content like WT under normal growth conditions or UV-C irradiation. These results indicate that the absence of AAO3 oxidation activity and not the lower ABA and its associated function is responsible for the earlier senescence symptoms in aao3 mutant.

However, optimizing root morphology with BC to help reduce N fertilization use and achieve consistent yields has not been widely investigated.MethodsTo address this, a two-year wheat field experiment was conducted in the drylands of the Loess Plateau in China. BC was applied at 0, 10, 20, and 30 t ha(- 1) (BC0, BC10, BC20, and BC30, respectively) along with two N fertilization treatments (90 and 120 kg N ha(- 1); N90 and N120, respectively).ResultsThe results showed that BC promoted root growth in 2017-2018 (normal year) and reduced excessive root growth in 2018-2019 (wet year). The root strategy that resulted from the BC treatments reduced the variation in mineral nitrogen storage (& UDelta;MNS) in the soil profile, thus supporting the efficient use of water and N for higher yields and partial factor productivity of N (PFPN), especially with the N120BC20 treatment. Furthermore, the PFPN was higher with the N90BC20 treatment than with the N120BC20 treatment, but there was no significant difference in yield. These results thus indicate that BC can compensate for the yield reduction caused by reduced N fertilizer use.ConclusionsOur study provides different insights into potential strategies to reduce N applications in semiarid farmland and other rain-fed cropping regions using a BC-optimized root system strategy.																			0032-079X	1573-5036				2023 JUL 17	2023										10.1007/s11104-023-06154-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-023-06154-9		JUL 2023											WOS:001028825400002

Wild soybean (Glycine soja), which has many superior traits, is an important germplasm resource and is also an excellent experimental material for researching the mechanisms of low-N tolerance. In this study, the physiological differences between common wild soybean (W1) and low-N tolerant wild soybean (W2) among growth characteristics, photosynthetic carbon (C) metabolism, N metabolism and C-N metabolic-coupling relationship were investigated, and the mechanism of low-N tolerance of wild soybean was explained at three different levels of low-N stress. Both W1 and W2 showed some resistance to low-level N stress. However, W2 could withstand the damage by increasing the root length and root-shoot ratio under high-level stress conditions. Moreover, when resisting low-N stress, W2 maintained a stable photosynthetic rate and coordinated ion balance to maintain required nutrient levels. W2 also tolerated low N by coordinating the C-N metabolic balance through the accumulation of soluble sugars to provide energy and C skeletons for N metabolism and through enhanced N metabolic enzyme activities and soluble protein accumulation levels to supply the enzyme proteins and photosynthetic pigments for C metabolism. The current results provide a physiological methodology and theoretical basis for protecting wild soybean germplasm resources and improving cultivated soybean.																			0255-965X	1842-4309				OCT-DEC	2019	47	4					1215	1223		10.15835/nbha47411567	http://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha47411567													WOS:000508003800024

Area of study: A semiarid area in northwestern China. Material and methods: The field (soil classified as CumuliUstic Isohumosol) has been planted with spring maize (Zea mays L.) for years. Three treatments were: 1) NPK fertilization and no film mulching (CK), 2) NPK fertilization and film mulching (PF) and 3) film mulching and NPK fertilization combined with cow manure (OMF). Main results: Compared with CK, OMF significantly increased SOC and TN, while no significant effect was observed under PF. The average increases of SOC storage in OMF were 39.2% in 0-10 cm layer and 34.3% in 10-20 cm layer. The average increases of TN storage were 37.6% in 0-10 cm layer and 31.3% in 10-20 cm layer, relative to CK. Compared with the initial SOC (8.86 g/kg) and TN (0.99 g/kg), CK and PF decreased 1.4% and 6.9% of SOC, and 9.1% and 17.2% of TN, whereas OMF increased SOC and TN. The SOC/TN was not affected by treatments but slight increase was observed since the beginning of experiment. Both PF and OMF significantly increased maize grain yields (on average 45.8% and 75.7%, respectively) compared with CK. Research highlights: Manure combined with film mulching significantly increased soil C and N, ameliorating harmful effects of plastic film mulching, improving soil fertility in the long term and increasing crop yields.

Quantifying the impact of check dams on sediment reduction in the CSHC region can provide a basis for regional management and decision-making of check dam construction. In this study, data from12 main tributaries in the region were collected, and the sediment reduction efficiency (SRE) of key dams was quantified by evaluating the sediment retention capacity (SRC) of key dams in different periods. The results showed that there were 3703 key dams in the CSHC region, among which the Wuding River watershed had the largest number of key dams (1139) and the largest total storage capacity (1332.9 Mm(3)). The annual sediment load of all tributaries showed a significant decreasing trend (P less than 0.01) over the past six decades. By 2018, the sediment reduction of the selected tributaries was basically more than 80%, which was mainly caused by human activities. Although the construction area of key dams in the CSHC region was increasing, the annual SRC of key dams was decreasing. In period 1, the average SRE of key dams on the west side was much higher than that on the east side. We determined that the influence of check dams in this area was weakening since the average SRE of key dams for the selected watersheds decreased from 24.38% of period 1 (1980-1999) to 11.24% of period 2 (2000-2018). In the future, the management strategy and construction planning of the CSHC region should consider the appropriate density and distribution of check dams, and explore how to maintain a sustainable vegetated ecosystem.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2021	602								126721	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126721	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126721		JUL 2021											WOS:000704794400022

Species co-occurrences in ectoparasite infracommunities: Accounting for confounding factors associated with space, time, and host community composition	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. We explored patterns of co-occurrence of ectoparasite species on individual hosts from Central Europe (Slovakia) and South America (Argentina) within and between higher taxa while controlling for confounding factors associated with variation between host individuals and host species, as well as spatial and temporal variation. We used a recently developed statistical approach, the hierarchical modelling of species communities. 2. Although the probability of pairwise associations of the majority of species in both regions did not differ from random, all significant species associations in Slovakia were positive, whereas the only three significant species associations in Argentina were negative. On average, associations between ectoparasite species belonging to different higher taxa were positive in Slovakia and negative in Argentina. 3. At the host species level, both positive and negative associations between species were detected in all higher taxa. This was also true for ectoparasite co-occurrences in the same site, habitat, or year; although the number of co-occurring species pairs with high posterior probability was much greater in Slovakia than in Argentina. 4. We conclude that consideration of species co-occurrences across the entire multi-host assemblage and control for confounding spatial and temporal factors provided important insights into parasite community structure.

The differences in carotenoid and phenylpropanoid contents between sites were seasonal and varietal dependent. However, the warmer RN site was generally associated with higher H2O2 levels and carotenoid degradation, and lower flavonol contents than the cooler MR site. Enhanced carotenoid degradation was positively correlated with radiation and daily degree days, leading to a greater drop in content from veraison to harvest in Colombard, Sauvignon Blanc, and Semillon berries. Analyses of berry H2O2 and phenylpropanoids suggested differences between cultivars in the links between H2O2 and flavonol contents. Generally, however, grapes with higher H2O2 content seem to have lower flavonol contents. Correlative network analyses revealed that phenylpropanoids at the warmer RN site are tightly linked to the radiation and temperature regimes during fruit ripening, indicating potentially harmful effect of warmer climates on berry quality. Specifically, flavan-3-ols were negatively correlated with radiation at RN. Principal component analysis showed that Muscat Blanc, Riesling, Semillon, and Sauvignon Blanc were the most site sensitive cultivars. Our results suggest that grapevine biodiversity is likely the key to withstand global warming hazards.

J	Zhao, QQ; Wang, L; Liu, H; Zhang, QF				Zhao, Qiaoqiao; Wang, Li; Liu, Hao; Zhang, Qingfeng			Runoff and sediment variation and attribution over 60 years in typical Loess Plateau basins	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												Purpose The trends in runoff and sediment transportation in typical Loess Plateau basins and the factors causing the changes need to be clarified. Materials and methods In this study, the runoff and sediment transportation data from 1960 to 2016, from hydrological stations (Wenjiachuan, Baijiachuan, Ganguyi, and Zhuangtou) based in four typical basins, were analyzed systematically using linear regression, anomaly accumulation, the Mann-Kendall test, and double accumulation curve. The characteristics of the runoff and sediment transportation and their responses to climatic and anthropogenic activities were investigated using several hydrological analytical and statistical methods. Results and discussion The results indicate that both runoff and sediment transportation in the four typical basins have decreased sharply from 1960 to 2016. Since the implementation of the Grain-for-Green Project in 1999, the reduction has been more marked, in particular the runoff and sediment discharge of the Kuye River (Wenjiachuan station). Compared with the period 1960-1999, the average annual runoff and sediment discharge in 2000-2016 had decreased by 76.72% and 94.50%, respectively. Apart from the Wuding River (Baijiachuan station), an abrupt change in runoff and sediment transportation in the basins occurred within 2-7 years of the implementation of the Grain-for-Green Project. Conclusions In general, returning farmland to forests (grass) has had a more pronounced effect on the reduction of runoff and sediment in the more northerly Kuye River (Wenjiachuan station) and Wuding River (Baijiachuan station) basins, compared with the more southerly Yanhe River (Ganguyi station) and Beiluo River (Zhuangtou station) basins.

However, the influence of large-scale afforestation on soil aggregate stability and erodibility in the Inf-ss Plateau is not well understood. To pcst-cs the sustainability and suitability of widespread, long-term planting of plantations in terms of soil aggregate stability (mean weighted diameter (MWD) and geometric mean diameter (GMD)) and erodibility (K), we performed a large-scale investigation of soil aggregate stability and soil erodibility of Robinia pseudoacacia (RP) and Caragana korshinskii (CK) plantations on the Loess Plateau. The results showed that the soil macroaggregate fraction (> 0.25 mm) content under RP and CK plantations had a decreasing trend with increasing latitude. Moreover, soil aggregate stability and soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) contents in RP and CK plantations decreased with increasing latitude. RP and CK plantations did not always result in improvement of soil aggregate stability and the accumulation of SOC and TN, which depended on the latitude and precipitation conditions. Specifically, RP planting in the south warm temperate forest subzone (STFZ) and north warm temperate forest subzone (NTFZ) could enhance the macroaggregate content ( > 5 mm), soil aggregate stability and soil nutrients, while CK planting for the improvement of the soil macroaggregate content, soil aggregate stability and soil nutrients in the temperate forest steppe subzone (TFSZ) was more effective than was RP planting. Correlation analysis showed that the latitude, longitude and mean annual precipitation (MAP) were significantly correlated with soil MWD, GMD, K values, SOC and TN across the RP and CK plantations, and soil MWD, GMD, and K values were significantly correlated with SOC and TN in RP and CK plantations. The changing trends of SOC and TN with latitude and longitude were consistent with that of soil aggregate stability with latitude and longitude under RP and CK plantations, indicating that changes in the SOC and TN concentrations will cause changes in soil aggregate stability and erodibility. Additionally, the effects of RP and CK plantations on the soil aggregate stability, erodibility, SOC and TN content were different and distinguished by latitude and MAP. RP plantation resulted in more SOC and TN accumulation, enhanced the soil aggregate stability and decreased erodibility compared with CK plantation in areas with MAP > 500 mm or latitude < 36 degrees N; in contrast, in sites with MAP < 500 mm or latitude > 36 degrees N, CK plantation had slight advantages over RP plantation. This study indicated that the changes in soil aggregate stability, erodibility, SOC and TN accumulation following RP and CK plantations had different patterns along latitude and precipitation gradients. Therefore, the 36 degrees N or 500 mm precipitation threshold may be the dividing line for planting RP and CK plantations. Overall, our study produces unique insights into the relative significance of environmental factors that influence aggregate stability at large scales and is useful for selecting suitable afforestation species and locations to optimize forest management with sustainable production.

J	Xu, XM; Huang, T				Xu, Xiaoming; Huang, Tao			Spatiotemporal Trends and Variation of Precipitation over China's Loess Plateau across 1957-2018	ATMOSPHERE												Better understanding of the spatiotemporal characteristics of precipitation is essential in developing the best management practices for ecological restoration and soil erosion control on China's Loess Plateau, an arid and semiarid region with severe soil erosion. This study aimed to explore the spatiotemporal trends of precipitation using long-term precipitation data from 1957 to 2018 from the 100 national standard meteorological stations across the Loess Plateau. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall statistical test and geospatial interpolation were used to detect the trends and to analyze spatial patterns of annual and seasonal precipitation. Wavelet analysis was applied to examine periodical variation across the plateau. The results reveal that regional annual precipitation over the Loess Plateau decreased during the 62 years of the study at a mean rate of -1.05 mm/10 years (p > 0.1). The changes in annual precipitation showed a periodical fluctuation with an increasing trend from 1957 to 1969, a decreasing trend from 1970 to 1999, and an increasing trend again in the first 18 years of the 21st century. The annual precipitation decreased in all eight sub-annual periods except for winter. Spatially, a decreasing trend occurred in the southern and eastern parts of the Loess Plateau, whereas a slight increase existed in the northwest in all periods. The decrease in six stations was statistically significant (p < 0.05), and a significant increase occurred in four stations (p < 0.1). These changes can be explained by an evident southward shift of the precipitation isohyets especially for 350 mm, 450 mm and 550 mm from the 1960s to the 1990s, and a clearly northward shift after the 1990s. Findings from this study facilitate an understanding of the spatial temporal trends of precipitation so appropriate countermeasures can be developed for effective vegetation restoration and soil erosion control across the Loess Plateau.																				2073-4433				FEB	2023	14	2							323	10.3390/atmos14020323	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos14020323													WOS:000938704600001

Thus, better climate change adaptation strategies need to be identified and implemented. This study aimed at identifying the farmers' perceptions of climate change and time series trend analysis of precipitation and temperature in northern Gondar Zuria District, Ethiopia. Data were gathered using a questionnaire from the institutional, socio-economic, and bio-physical situation of the 121 sample households. The survey data were analyzed using SPSS software version 21, XLSTAT software, and excel spreadsheets. The climate change trend analysis was conducted using monthly precipitation, which has been downloaded from free online resources such as Global Precipitation. The temperature data were collected using the Climate Centre and Climate Research Unit with 0.5 by 0.5 degree resolutions from 1980 to 2013. The climate variable data have been analyzed using a precipitation concentration index, anomaly index, coefficient of variation, simple linear regression, and Mann-Kendall test. The result revealed that for the main rain season (summer), a statistically insignificant decreasing trend was obtained. In the Belg season, there was a growing trend of precipitation. The max monthly and annual temperatures have increased significantly over time. However, the min temperature trend shows a non-significant increasing trend over the 1980-2013 periods. The recorded monthly precipitation and temperature data trend analysis were similar to the farmers' perceptions of changes in temperature and rainfall over the past 30 years. Therefore, we recommend possible adaptation strategies designed for climate change. Particularly, countries whose economy is dependent on rain-fed agriculture should pay attention to the increasing trend of temperature and the decreasing and unreliable nature of rainfall.

Rain gauges are the most common method to measure rainfall, but these are sparse in mountainous areas. Satellite and reanalysis products can provide rainfall information over a large area but often have large uncertainty in high elevation environments. A recently developed "bottom-up" approach (SM2RAIN, Soil Moisture to Rain) estimates rainfall from soil moisture dynamics and provides a novel method to estimate rainfall. However, the reliability and accuracy of this method in high-altitude mountainous areas are currently not well understood. This study evaluates the SM2RAIN method under different environmental conditions based on data from 9 in-situ soil moisture and rainfall observation stations in the Qilian Mountains in Northwest China. Subsequently, we compare the Rsim (rainfall estimated using the SM2RAIN in-situ), the global SM2RAIN rainfall product (SM2RAIN-ASCAT) and the reanalysis rainfall product (China Meteorological Forcing Dataset, CMFD) with the in-situ rainfall observations. Results show that the performance of SM2RAIN decreases with increasing elevation. SM2RAIN performs well in alpine meadows, but underestimates rainfall in forestland due to strong interception, and overestimates rainfall in farmland due to irrigation. Meanwhile, SM2RAIN has the potential to evaluate the interception capacity of forestland and the irrigation of farmland. The SM2RAIN-ASCAT and CMFD have similar performances in estimating daily rainfall in the study area. Calibration of SM2RAIN using high spatio-temporal resolution soil moisture products and an advanced bias-correction method can significantly improve rainfall estimation performance in data-scarce mountainous areas.					tian, jie/ABD-4663-2021; He, Chansheng/A-3337-2008	tian, jie/0000-0002-4845-5085; He, Chansheng/0000-0001-7748-0485													0022-1694	1879-2707				MAR	2022	606								127430	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127430	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127430		JAN 2022											WOS:000752456500004

However, the responses of soil microbial nitrogen functional genes (NFGs) to N addition and their consequent effect on the N-cycle processes are poorly understood. In this study, soil samples were collected from an artificial Pinus tabulaeformis forest located in Loess Plateau (China) to which N at four different concentrations was added (0 [N0], 3 [N3], 6 [N6], and 9 [N9] g N m(-2) y(-1)) for 4 years. We quantified the relative abundance of NFGs using functional gene microarray GeoChip 5.0 and determined net N transformation and N2O emission rates in a 14-day incubation experiment. The results showed that N-3 and N6 treatments did not significantly affect the total relative abundance and diversity of NFGs assemblage but significantly increased the relative abundance of specific genes for the NH3 cycle (ureC, nirA, and nrfA), and nitrification (amoA) and denitrification (norB). These positive effects were related to the increase in soil organic C, NO3--N, and microbial biomass C (MBC). N9 treatment significantly decreased the relative abundance of all NFGs, and this negative impact was correlated with reduced dissolved organic C and MBC. Moreover, N addition significantly changed net N nitrification, mineralization, and N2O emission rates, and NFGs explained the higher variances in the N transformation processes than soil properties. Specifically, ammonia-oxidizing archaea (amoA-AOB) and MBC were the key factors related to net N nitrification; ureC, nirK, and MBC were the key factors related to net N mineralization; and narG and nirS were the key factors related to N2O emission. Our results show that global N deposition may mainly influence N transformation processes by regulating the corresponding NFG relative abundance, thereby affecting the N cycle in forest soils.

The Dynamics of Collective Action and Political Agency in the Leeward Kohala Hinterlands, Hawai'i Island	JOURNAL OF PACIFIC ARCHAEOLOGY												The kua'aina, or backcountry, in the Hawaiian Islands was the setting for a dynamic back-and-forth between the collective action of commoner class farmers and political elites. We examine how the long-term history of that dynamic left behind spatial patterns in the form and distribution of domestic, agricultural, and ritual architecture across the Leeward Kohala Field System. We find a contrast between places that were the best and most reliable for farming and lands prone to shortfalls. Less ideal lands were less densely populated with fewer efforts to standardize plot sizes and a lower investment in temple architecture. We suggest that as leeward Kohala was drawn more and more into competition for power that involved local and non-local chiefs, the autonomy of residents diminished, and the ability of local inhabitants to negotiate the demands of elites after this shift was variable, with greater demands likely placed on residents living in optimal zones.

Wayne; Acosta-Martinez, Veronica; Moore, Jennifer M.; McLendon, Terry			Net positive soil water content following cover crops with no tillage in irrigated semi-arid cotton production	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Conservation management practices such as no-tillage and cover cropping can reduce soil erosion, enhance soil biological activity, increase water capture and storage, and sequester C. Cover crops, however, utilize stored soil water during the winter months, and the water depletion is thought to have negative impacts on the subsequent cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) crop in semi-arid ecoregions where water resources are limited. The objective of this research was to quantify the long-term impacts of conservation tillage and cover crop use on volumetric water content of soil in an irrigated cotton production system. Soil water was measured in a long-term (established 1998) conservation system in Lamesa, TX and water dynamics during the 2015-2017 growing seasons are presented here. Volumetric water content was reduced by cover crops prior to their termination but was replenished by spring precipitation and deficit irrigation prior to planting cotton. A stepwise regression analysis was used to determine changes in soil water at depth. In each of the study years, soil water increased more with no-tillage following cover crop termination and decreased less during cotton growth than the conventionally tilled system. Cotton water use efficiency was not significantly different between treatments in any year. Results from this study challenge the concept that winter cover crops result in reduced in-season soil water in irrigated systems, a supposition that has limited adoption of conservation tillage and cover crop use on the Texas High Plains.

J	Zhang, HB; Han, K; Gu, SB; Wang, D				Zhang, Hongbo; Han, Kun; Gu, Shubo; Wang, Dong			Effects of supplemental irrigation on the accumulation, distribution and transportation of <SUP>13</SUP>C-photosynthate, yield and water use efficiency of winter wheat	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Water resources are increasingly scarce, and droughts are frequent in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain of China. There is an urgent need for developing water-saving technologies for winter wheat production in this region. Field experiments were carried out in silty loam soil from 2012 to 2014. Based on the same water condition in seeding period and the normal emergence of winter wheat, five supplemental irrigation (SI) regimes differing in the timing of SI were established. Crop development was categorized using the Zadoks scale. T1: no irrigation after emergence; T2: SI at jointing (4th node detectable, Z34); T3: SI at pre-wintering (average daily temperature drops to about 2 degrees and the wheat plant basically stops growing) and jointing; T4: SI at jointing and anthesis complete (Z69); T5: SI at pre-wintering, jointing and anthesis complete. The results showed that SI brought the soil water content in the 0-20 cm profile to 100% field capacity at the pre-wintering, jointing and anthesis complete stages of winter wheat, mainly improving the water supply condition in the 0-40 cm soil layer. Compared with no irrigation after emergence, SI at jointing and anthesis complete significantly increased grain yield by increasing the spike number, kernel number and grain weight. SI at the pre-wintering stage can improve grain number and yield under the condition of no SI at anthesis complete (comparing T3 with T2), but had no significant effect on grain yield when SI was supplied at jointing and anthesis complete (comparing T5 with T4), and even worse, the irrigation water use efficiency decreased. The decrease of water supply before anthesis complete significantly reduced the dry matter accumulation and photosynthetic rate at anthesis but promoted the translocation of photosynthates to the plant ear. SI at anthesis complete is advantageous for the assimilation of carbohydrates in the middle and late grain filling stage and for the distribution of those carbohydrates from vegetative organs to grain. These results indicated that SI at jointing and anthesis complete was conducive to coordinating the relationship between photosynthesis and photosynthates retranslocated after anthesis, and may improve the harvest index, grain yield and water use efficiency.

Significant findings: Studies have shown that MPHCM can effectively remove phosphate from water. At 318 K and with pH=3, the maximum adsorption capacity reached 181.96 mg P g-1, and the adsorption process conformed to the pseudo-first and pseudo-secondary adsorption kinetic models and the Langmuir adsorption model. This adsorption process involved physical and chemical adsorption, which indicated monolayer adsorption. The main adsorption mechanisms for MPHCM were protonation, electrostatic interactions, ligand exchange and inner sphere complex precipitation. Six desorption cycles verified the excellent reproducibility of MPHCM for phos-phate removal. Therefore, this study provides a new adsorbent for phosphate removal and expands the appli-cation range of potassium humate-based carbon materials.																			1876-1070	1876-1089				NOV	2022	140								104540	10.1016/j.jtice.2022.104540	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtice.2022.104540		OCT 2022											WOS:000868271300003

Osbeck) in the Northern Ethiopia	HORTICULTURAL PLANT JOURNAL												Rootstocks have a significant influence on adaptation to biotic and abiotic stress conditions and quality of fruit. So, choice of rootstock for a specific growing region is an important decision for a grower to make when establishing a commercial citrus orchard. This study was undertaken to assess effects of rootstock and location on quality of orange fruit. The study was conducted over two consecutive years (2017/18 and 2018/19). Scions from the Gunda Gundo orange grove were grafted on rough lemon and sour orange rootstocks and planted in Tigray and Afar, Ethiopia at four sites (Abala, Agulae, Adiha and Rama). The experiment was laid out in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with four replications. Data on different physico-chemical and bioactive compounds were collected and analyzed using R software (version 4). Compared to sour orange, rough lemon rootstock revealed higher fruit mass (151.96 g, 195.38 g), fruit length (62.27 mm, 68.88 mm) and fruit diameter (65.58 mm, 71.3 mm), in 2017/18, 2018/19, respectively. Among the four locations (Abala, Agulae, Adiha and Rama), higher juice percentage was found in Adiha (43.47% in 2017/18) and Abala (49.87%, in 2018/19). In 2017/18 higher total soluble solid (TSS, 13.87%), TSS/acid ratio (19.18) and fruit rag (32.77%), were obtained at the Rama site. On the one hand, higher vitamin C (826.6 mg.kg(-1)) and total phenolic content (208 mg.kg(-1) GAE) were recorded at Agulae than Abala, Adiha and Rama sites from sour orange rootstock. High TSS, TSS/acid ratio and antioxidant were recorded from orange fruits at Rama site. This was expected to have resulted from hot climate conditions at the site. Besides, at a relatively cooler condition of the Agulae site, high phenolic, reduced ferric power and high vitamin C were recorded. Rough lemon rootstock improved fruit size, while rootstock did not affect the contents of TSS, TSS/acid ratio across the sites in both harvesting years.

(Black nightshade), is one of the most troublesome weeds of summer crops such as corn, soybean, sunflower, etc. To study the effect of combined Castor oil as an adjuvant with different doses of Lumax (Mesotrion+S-metolacholor+Terbuthylazine) on the physiological behavior of Solanum nigrum L., a greenhouse experiment was conducted in randomized complete block design with four replications in agricultural faculty of the University of Tabriz in 2021. A foliar application of Lumax increased proline, malondialdehyde, and hydrogen peroxide concentrations and superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase activity. The content of protein and photosynthetic pigments (Chlorophyll a, b, and carotenoids) also decreased significantly by using Lumax herbicide. Applying castor oil in combination with Lumax intensifies oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. Results showed that by increasing the herbicide doses in comparison with control (non-herbicide), Area, Fm, Fv, Fv/Fm, Fv/F0, Sm, Sm/Tfm, and Fv/F0 decreased 48.32%, 19.52%, 27.95%, 10.47%, 50.90%, 28.34%, 79.38%, and 50.90%, respectively and F0, F0/Fm increased 46.76% and 82.38%, respectively. Castor oil showed a synergistic effect on Lumax herbicide and enhanced its efficacy on Solanum nigrum. The presented results supported the view that by evaluating chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters, we would realize herbicide (alone or mixed with any adjacent) efficacy before the visual symptoms appear in the plant.																			2045-2322					JAN 9	2023	13	1							409	10.1038/s41598-023-27428-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-27428-3								36624299					WOS:000915457700038

Wheat comprises approximately 20% of the human diet worldwide; therefore, reducing the concentrations of Cd in wheat grain will have significant impacts on the intake of Cd in food products. The tests for measuring the Cd content in grain are costly, and the content is affected significantly by soil pH. To facilitate breeding for low Cd content, this study sought to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) and associated molecular markers that can be used in molecular breeding. One spring wheat population of 181 doubled haploid lines (DHLs), which was derived from a cross between two hard white spring wheat cultivars "UI Platinum" (UIP) and "LCS Star" (LCS), was assessed for the Cd content in grain in multiple field trials in Southeast Idaho, United States. Three major QTL regions, namely, QCd.uia2-5B, QCd.uia2-7B, and QCd.uia2-7D, were identified on chromosomes 5B, 7B, and 7D, respectively. All genes in these three QTL regions were identified from the NCBI database. However, three genes related to the uptake and transport of Cd were used in the candidate gene analysis. The sequences of TraesCS5B02G388000 (TaHMA3) in the QCd.uia2-5B region and TraesCS7B02G320900 (TaHMA2) and TraesCS7B02G322900 (TaMSRMK3) in the QCd.uia2-7B region were compared between UIP and LCS. TaHMA2 on 7B is proposed for the first time as a candidate gene for grain Cd content in wheat. A KASP marker associated with this gene was developed and it will be further validated in near-isogenic lines via a gene-editing system in future studies.																			1664-462X					DEC 2	2021	12								756741	10.3389/fpls.2021.756741	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.756741								34925407					WOS:000731092000001

An infiltration hole is a supplemental measure for slope rainwater harvesting measure and is commonly used in vegetation restoration and orchard management of slopes. However, the evaporation effects of infiltration holes are unclear. In this study, we determined the evaporation effects of infiltration holes under a high initial soil water content and compared the differences in inhibition of soil evaporation among infiltration holes, mulching, and their combination after a rainstorm event. The results showed that the infiltration holes at different depths increased soil daily evaporation in the first 26 days under the high initial soil water content, after which it decreased. Compared with the control, the average daily evaporation while covering the top surface and the hole (sidewall and bottom) decreased by 74.3% and 4.3%, respectively. After the rainstorm event, cumulative evaporation (97 days) significantly decreased by 42.0% and 34.0% under the infiltration hole compared to gravel mulching and branch mulching, respectively. Overall, the infiltration hole increased soil evaporation at the early stage. Soil water mainly evaporated through the top surface of the soil column rather than through the hole itself. In the long term after rainstorms, infiltration holes have better effects in inhibiting evaporation than mulching. Our findings determine the evaporation effects of infiltration holes in the process of harvesting rainwater to replenish soil water in semi-arid rainfed agricultural areas.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				JAN 1	2023	275								108049	10.1016/j.agwat.2022.108049	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2022.108049													WOS:001099148700006

A pot experiment was carried out to investigate the individual and combined effects of Cd (0, 10, 20 mg kg(-1)) and Pb (0, 500, 1000 mg kg(-1)) level in a calcareous soil on the status of mineral nutrients, including K, P, Ca, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn, in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) plants. Soil Pb level considerably (P <= 0.05) affected the concentrations of more elements in plants than soil Cd level did, and there were combined effects of soil Cd level and Pb level on the concentrations of some nutrients (Ca, Mg, and Cu) in plants. The effects of soil Cd level and Pb level on plant nutrient concentrations varied among plant parts. Cd and Pb contamination did not considerably affect the exudation of carboxylates in the rhizosphere. An increase in rhizosphere pH and exudation of significant amounts of carboxylates (especially oxalate) in the rhizosphere might contribute to the exclusion and detoxification of Cd and Pb. Neither shoot dry mass nor root dry mass was significantly influenced by soil Cd level, but both of them were considerably reduced (by up to 25% and 45% on average for shoot dry mass and root dry mass, respectively) by increasing soil Pb level. The interaction between soil Cd level and Pb level was significant for root dry mass, but not significant for shoot dry mass. The results indicate that alfalfa is tolerant to Cd and Pb stress, and it is promising to grow alfalfa for phytostabilization of Cd and Pb on calcareous soils contaminated with Cd and Pb.																			0038-0768	1747-0765				MAY 3	2020	66	3					506	514		10.1080/00380768.2020.1747362	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00380768.2020.1747362		APR 2020											WOS:000524020700001

In order to investigate the effects of different drip irrigation nitrogen application frequencies on the processing quality of medium-gluten wheat (Jimai22) and strong-gluten wheat (Jimai20 and Shiluan02-1), a two-year field experiment was carried out. Two frequencies of water and N application were set under the same conditions of total N application (210 kg.ha(-1)) and total irrigation (120 mm): DIF4, consisting of four equal applications of water and N (each of 30 kg.ha(-1) of N application and 30 mm of irrigation) and DIF2, consisting of two equal applications of water and N (each of 60 kg.ha(-1) of N application and 60 mm of irrigation). The results showed that IF4 significantly increased protein content by 2-8.6%, wet gluten content by 4.5-22.1%, and hardness value (p > 0.05), and PC2 was considered as a protein factor; the sedimentation value was highly significantly correlated with most of the parameters of the flour stretch (p < 0.01). DIF4 improved the stretching quality, and the flour quality of Jima22 was decreased, the flour quality of strong-gluten wheats Jimai20 and Shiluan02-1 was improved, and PC1 was considered to be the dough factor. In conclusion, although the frequency of nitrogen application by drip irrigation increased the protein factor and improved the tensile quality, the flour quality was not necessarily enhanced.																				2223-7747				DEC	2023	12	23							3974	10.3390/plants12233974	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants12233974								38068610					WOS:001119101400001
J	Wang, CG; Li, ZB; Wang, SS				Wang, Chenguang; Li, Zhanbin; Wang, Shanshan			Determination of the maximum run-off sediment transport capacity during a rainstorm flood in a small watershed on the Loess Plateau	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												The channel sediment transport capacity is an important parameter in soil erosion models, and it determines the proportion of soil erosion that is sent outside the watershed. However, the calculation and judgment methods for the sediment transport capacity of channel are still incomplete, and further research is needed. Therefore, this paper takes Chabagou, a typical watershed in the hilly and gully region of the Loess Plateau, as an example and, based on the measured hydrological and sediment data collected during rainstorm floods in 1961-1969 at three hydrological stations, Caoping, Shejiagou, and Tuanshangou, studies the sediment transport capacity of channels in a small watershed from the perspective of energy dissipation. Clearly, the sediment transport capacity is better determined by using a single flood and sediment concentration peak process. The discriminant conditions are determined for the sediment concentration to reach sediment transport capacity during the flood rising and falling sections of the sediment process of the small watershed storm flood. When determining sediment transport capacity based on the characteristics of the flood and sediment concentration peak, we find that sediment transport capacity is reached in the flood discharge peak when the flood discharge peak occurs earlier than the sediment concentration peak. When determining sediment transport capacity based on the flow discharge and sediment concentration characteristics of the sediment fall section, we find that when the flood event exhibits a counterclockwise hysteresis curve and a time-lagged effect occurs, the sediment concentration at that time reaches sediment transport capacity. In this study, the sediment concentration as a function of run-off amount is logarithmic at different subbasin scales when run-off reaches its maximum capacity to transport sediment. The R-2 is high, ranging from 0.78 to 0.92. The results of this research provide a reference for the study of sediment transport capacity.																			0197-9337	1096-9837				2023 SEP 27	2023										10.1002/esp.5710	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/esp.5710		SEP 2023											WOS:001073533700001

Open Defecation Practices in Lodwar, Kenya: A Mixed-Methods Research	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH INSIGHTS												BACKGROUND: As of the year 2014, about 2.5 billion people globally lacked access to improved sanitation. The situation is even worse in the sub-Saharan African countries including Kenya. The practice of open defecation (OD) peaks beyond 72% of the population in Turkana County, Kenya, despite various interventions to end it. METHODS : This article reports on both qualitative and quantitative aspects of a cross-sectional study. A partially mixed sequential dominant (quantitative) status was used to understand various socioeconomic factors associated with OD practice in Lodwar's human settlements, Turkana County. Simple random sampling technique was chosen to select participants for this study with the sample drawn from various administrative units of Lodwar. Standardized questionnaires, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews were used to collect data. RESULTS : The quantitative findings revealed that culture was the leading factor as to why people practiced OD with a frequency of 44%. The findings further revealed that poverty was the major influencing factor for latrine ownership among the households (frequency 27%). Pearson chi(2) tests revealed that there was a significant association between latrine presence and education level of the household head (chi(2) = 107.317; P < .05), latrine sharing (chi(2) = 403; P < .05), and occupation of the household head (chi(2) = 74.51; P < .05). The quantitative findings showed that culture was by far the most common factor that contributed to the OD practice with a theme intensity of 31.1%. Further analyses identified 5 major cultural aspects that were associated with OD practice. This included sexual immorality, OD as a common habit, nomadic pastoralism, bride's dignity and mixing of feces. Open defecation as a common habit among the respondents was the most cited factor that contributed to its rampant practice (theme intensity 31.3%) followed closely by nomadic pastoralism kind of life among the residents that limit latrine construction (theme intensity 28.1%). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to cultural aspects, high poverty levels influence latrine adoption and consequently OD practices. Future sanitation interventions addressing OD should assess and factor in these cultural aspects in such communities to come up with appropriate eradication measures which have otherwise been difficult to solve through poverty eradication and sanitation campaigns that have been in existence.

Soil water dynamics and biomass production of young rooibos (<i>Aspalathus linearis</i>) plants	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) is endemic to certain regions of the Western- and Northern Cape of South Africa, where it is also commercially grown. Being low-rainfall regions, information on the soil water balance of rooibos is essential, but such data is limited. Consequently, the effect of inorganic fertilisation and soil depth on soil water dynamics in a young rooibos plantation at Nardouwsberg, Western Cape were studied. Soil water content of plots planted to unfertilised and fertilised plants as well as that of bare soil were determined over the duration of the 2016/17 season. All treatments were replicated on shallow and deep soils sites and plant growth was determined at the end of the season. At the end of the study, the profile soil water content and evapotranspiration of the bare and planted plots were similar which prove that fallowing (water harvesting) is not an option in the sandy soils of this region. With the exception of the 20-30 cm root zone of the planted plots at the deep site, the water content decreased to levels below the permanent wilting point in the soil profile during summer. It was concluded that rooibos plants could survive through an adapted root system. A further survival method was proposed, involving moisture moved through evaporation from the deeper soil layers into the drying-front in the similar to 10-30 cm soil layer where a condensation-evaporation cycle enables rooibos to harvest small amounts of water. The highest shoot biomass with the longest taproot resulted from the unfertilised treatment on the deep soil thanks to higher soil water content, whereas the shoot and root biomass of the fertilised treatment at both sites were low due to high P soil concentration. This study revealed that unfertilised plants on deeper soils result in higher rooibos production under drought conditions.

Can it be used to change endangered ecological communities and rescue them to prevent their collapse? What are the best strategies for such ecological engineering paths to succeed? Is it possible to create stable, diverse synthetic ecosystems capable of persisting in closed environments? Can synthetic communities be created to thrive on planets different from ours? These and other questions pervade major future developments within synthetic biology. The goal of engineering ecosystems is plagued with all kinds of technological, scientific and ethic problems. In this paper, we consider the requirements for terraformation, i.e., for changing a given environment to make it hospitable to some given class of life forms. Although the standard use of this term involved strategies for planetary terraformation, it has been recently suggested that this approach could be applied to a very different context: ecological communities within our own planet.

J	Li, CH; Shi, WH; Huang, MB				Li, Chenhui; Shi, Wenhai; Huang, Mingbin			Effects of Crop Rotation and Topography on Soil Erosion and Nutrient Loss under Natural Rainfall Conditions on the Chinese Loess Plateau	LAND												Erosive rainfall results in the loss of both soil and nutrients, which indirectly triggers soil deterioration and a reduction in land productivity. However, how rainfall affects runoff, soil erosion, and nutrient loss under different crop rotation patterns and topographic factors remains unclear. This experiment observed nine runoff-erosion plots on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) from 2019 to 2020 to determine the effects of crop type, rotation pattern, and slope gradient and length on runoff, soil erosion, and nutrient loss. Runoff, soil erosion, and nutrient loss were highest for the fallow plots; values for these variables for spring corn and winter wheat plots were not significantly different. Crop rotation generated greater runoff, soil erosion, and nutrient loss compared to non-rotation. Soil erosion and associated nutrient loss increased, but not significantly, with slope for gradients of 0.5 degrees, 1 degrees, and 3 degrees, while runoff and associated nutrient loss did not increase. In addition, soil erosion and associated nutrient loss were significantly greater for slope lengths of 20 m vs. 50 m. A structural equation model showed rainfall characteristics significantly impacted runoff and soil erosion and subsequently affected nutrient loss. This study increases the understanding of runoff, soil erosion, and nutrient loss from cropland with gentle slopes on the CLP.					shi, wenhai/GWZ-2022-2022	shi, wenhai/0000-0002-7488-5433; huang, ming bin/0000-0001-9792-3124														2073-445X				FEB	2023	12	2							265	10.3390/land12020265	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land12020265													WOS:000940575700001
J	Li, GQ; Huang, JH; Guo, H; Du, S				Li, Guoqing; Huang, Jinghua; Guo, Hua; Du, Sheng			Projecting species loss and turnover under climate change for 111 Chinese tree species	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Climate-change-induced habitat loss will be the largest global threat to biodiversity. Therefore, quantifying regional species loss and turnover is important for alerting scientists and policymakers to potential future risks and supporting the development of proactive strategies to reduce the impact of climate change on biodiversity. Here, we projected species turnover and loss for 111 Chinese tree species under four climate change scenarios (representative concentration path ways 2.6 (RCP2.6), RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5). The results show that many Chinese trees will be seriously threatened and the extent of this threat depends firstly on the migration scenarios and secondly on the climate change scenarios. On average across RCP scenarios, about 57% or 23% of the trees would be vulnerable or threatened under no migration assumption or universal migration by 2070, respectively. Projection of species loss and turnover in grid cells indicates considerable variation across climate change scenarios (22-50% and 40-67%, respectively) and across geographical regions (25.4-58.1% and 40.6-78.8%, respectively). Species from arid regions and monsoon regions will undergo more species loss than alpine regions under climate change. This is the opposite for species turnover. Notably, extinction risks for Chinese trees species may be high; even under the most conservative situation (RCP2.6 and universal migration), 18% trees will still be vulnerable or threatened. We suggest that a further studying trees adaptation strategy to climate change is required to ensure the sustainable development of China's forests.

However, the relationship between the litter decomposition process and the decomposition stage, precipitation, and litter quality has rarely been addressed, precluding our understanding of how litter decomposition regulates nutrient cycling in various ecosystems and their responses to climate change. In this study, we measured mass loss as well as carbon and nutrient releases during the decomposition of 16 types of leaf litter under three precipitation treatments over 12 months in a common garden experiment (i.e., using standardized soil and climatic conditions). Sixteen types of leaves were divided into three functional groups (evergreen, deciduous, and herbaceous). The objectives were to understand the effects of decomposition stages and precipitation regimes on litter decomposition and to examine the relationship between this effect and chemical properties. The mass loss and release of nitrogen and potassium were significantly higher in the 6- to 12-month stage of decomposition (high temperature and humidity) than in the 0- to 6-month stage. Phosphorus was relatively enriched in evergreen leaves after 6 months of decomposition. The rates of mass loss and nutrient release were significantly greater in herbaceous than in deciduous and evergreen leaves. Increasing precipitation from 400 to 800 mm accelerated mass loss and potassium release but decreased phosphorus release in the 0- to 6-month stage of decomposition. These results highlighted the contribution to and complexity of litter chemical properties in litter decomposition.																			2045-7758					APR	2020	10	7					3367	3382		10.1002/ece3.6129	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.6129								32273994					WOS:000524417200018

Tri-trophic interactions are resilient to large shifts in precipitation levels in a wheat agroecosystem	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Changing climatic conditions can fundamentally alter the interactions between species with important implications for agriculture. The impacts of shifts in precipitation on trophic interactions have been understudied relative to other climate drivers. We carried out field experiments to examine how precipitation, attack by parasitoid wasps (Bracon cephi (Gahan))(Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and their potential interaction affect the performance of a major pest of wheat, Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), and its impact on wheat yield. We independently manipulated insects (no insects, + C. cinctus, or + C. cinctus and B. cephi) and precipitation (-50% to -70%, ambient, + 70%) in a factorial design in each of two growing seasons. Crop-herbivoreparasitoid interactions were remarkably robust to our precipitation manipulations with no significant changes in C. cinctus infestation, survival or levels of parasitism observed in the first (wetter) year of the study. Despite slight declines in pest infestation and percent parasitism under precipitation addition relative to reduction in the second year, both insects had strong and significant impacts on crop yield. These effects were consistent across precipitation manipulations, as evidenced by the lack of a significant interaction between insect and precipitation treatments. The results suggest that natural enemy benefits to crop production in this system can be substantial, and are likely to be robust across a relatively wide range of precipitation levels. While rare, studies that examine climate influences within a tri-trophic context are critical to predicting how pest insects will ultimately impact crop production under changing climatic conditions.

The LEA genes have been studied systematically in several crops but not in Vigna crops. In this study, we reported the first comprehensive analysis of the LEA gene family in three legume species, namely, mung bean (Vigna radiata), adzuki bean (Vigna angularis), and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), and the cross-species expression of VrLEA genes in a wild tetraploid species, Vigna glabrescens. A total of 201 LEA genes from three Vigna crops were identified harboring the LEA conserved motif. Among these 55, 64, and 82 LEA genes were identified in mung bean, adzuki bean, and cowpea genomes, respectively. These LEA genes were grouped into eight different classes. Our analysis revealed that the cowpea genome comprised all eight classes of LEA genes, whereas the LEA-6 class was absent in the mung bean genome. Similarly, LEA-5 and LEA-6 were absent in the adzuki bean genome. The analysis of LEA genes provides an insight into their structural and functional diversity in the Vigna genome. The genes, such as VrLEA-2, VrLEA-40, VrLEA-47, and VrLEA-55, were significantly upregulated in the heat-tolerant genotype under stress conditions indicating the basis of heat tolerance. The successful amplification and expression of VrLEA genes in V. glabrescens indicated the utility of the developed markers in mung bean improvement. The results of this study increase our understanding of LEA genes and provide robust candidate genes for future functional investigations and a basis for improving heat stress tolerance in Vigna crops.

A total of 1504 leaves from 40 genotypes were collected, covering a large range of leaf sizes. Width, length, area, and weight were measured for each leaflet. The total leaf area and weight was obtained by the sum of left, central, and right leaflets. The dataset was randomly divided into training and validation sets. The training set was used for model fitting and selection, and the validation dataset was used to obtain statistics for model prediction ability. The leaf area and leaf weight were modeled using different linear regression models based on the length and width of the leaflet. Polynomial regressions involving both length and width of the leaflet provided very good models to estimate the expected area (R-2 = 0.978) and weight (R-2 = 0.820) of leaves.					suárez salazar, juan carlos/GXH-2202-2022; Casanoves, Fernando/I-3588-2016	Casanoves, Fernando/0000-0001-8765-9382; Suarez Salazar, Juan Carlos/0000-0001-5928-1837														2073-4395				MAR	2022	12	3							711	10.3390/agronomy12030711	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12030711													WOS:000775650500001

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of root morphology traits of herbaceous plants on the soil detachment process. Ten herbaceous plants (dominant species) in the Loess Plateau were selected, and 300 undisturbed soil samples (including living roots from the selected herbages) were scoured with flowing water to measure their soil detachment capacities under six levels of shear stress (4.98 to 16.37 Pa). Then, the root traits of each soil sample were measured, and the rill erodibility and critical shear stress were estimated based on the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model. The results showed that root morphology traits varied greatly among the ten selected herbages. Accordingly, resulting variations in soil detachment capacity (0.030 to 3.297 kg m(-2) s(-1)), rill erodibility (0.004 to 0.447 s m(-1)), and critical shear stress (4.73 to 1.13 Pa) were also observed. Plants with fibrous roots were more effective than those with tap roots in reducing soil detachment. Their mean soil detachment capacity and rill erodibility were 93.2% and 93.4% lower, respectively, and their mean critical shear stress was 1.15 times greater than that of the herbaceous plants with tap root systems. Of all the root traits, root surface area density (RSAD) was the primary root trait affecting the soil detachment, and it estimated the soil detachment capacity well (R-2 = 0.91, normalized squared error (NSE) = 0.82). Additionally, an equation with few factors (soil aggregate and RSAD) was suggested to simulate the soil detachment capacity when the plant root parameters and soil properties were limited.

Varma			Functional Dissection of the Chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum L.</i>) Stay-Green Phenotype Associated with Molecular Variation at an Ortholog of Mendel's I Gene for Cotyledon Color: Implications for Crop Production and Carotenoid Biofortification	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES												"Stay-green" crop phenotypes have been shown to impact drought tolerance and nutritional content of several crops. We aimed to genetically describe and functionally dissect the particular stay-green phenomenon found in chickpeas with a green cotyledon color of mature dry seed and investigate its potential use for improvement of chickpea environmental adaptations and nutritional value. We examined 40 stay-green accessions and a set of 29 BC2F4-5 stay-green introgression lines using a stay-green donor parent ICC 16340 and two Indian elite cultivars (KAK2, JGK1) as recurrent parents. Genetic studies of segregating populations indicated that the green cotyledon trait is controlled by a single recessive gene that is invariantly associated with the delayed degreening (extended chlorophyll retention). We found that the chickpea ortholog of Mendel's I locus of garden pea, encoding a SGR protein as very likely to underlie the persistently green cotyledon color phenotype of chickpea. Further sequence characterization of this chickpea ortholog CaStGR1 (CaStGR1, for carietinum stay-green gene 1) revealed the presence of five different molecular variants (alleles), each of which is likely a loss-of-function of the chickpea protein (CaStGR1) involved in chlorophyll catabolism. We tested the wild type and green cotyledon lines for components of adaptations to dry environments and traits linked to agronomic performance in different experimental systems and different levels of water availability. We found that the plant processes linked to disrupted CaStGR1 gene did not functionality affect transpiration efficiency or water usage. Photosynthetic pigments in grains, including provitaminogenic carotenoids important for human nutrition, were 2-3-fold higher in the stay-green type. Agronomic performance did not appear to be correlated with the presence/absence of the stay-green allele. We conclude that allelic variation in chickpea CaStGR1 does not compromise traits linked to environmental adaptation and agronomic performance, and is a promising genetic technology for biofortification of provitaminogenic carotenoids in chickpea.

J	Khojastehnazhand, M; Roostaei, M				Khojastehnazhand, Mostafa; Roostaei, Mozaffar			Classification of seven Iranian wheat varieties using texture features	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS												Wheat is a major crop in Iran and plays an essential role in satisfying human nutritional needs. Depending on the geographical location as well as the climatic conditions of each region, different varieties of this crop can be cultivated. The purity of the seeds used for field cultivation has a substantial impact on both field efficiency and flour quality as the final product. To increase the seed supplied for cultivation in seed supply centers, the use of new non-destructive automatic methods for this purpose is indispensable. In this study, 7 varieties of wheat in the East Azerbaijan Province were investigated by employing a machine vision system. By extracting texture features using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRM), and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) algorithms and classifying using principal component analysis (PCA) as the unsupervised method, along with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as supervised methods, the system accuracy was surveyed. Results indicated that modeling using a combination of all extracted features (125 features) yielded the best results by the ANN model, which the Correct Classification Rate (CCR) was obtained 100% and 95.04% for training and testing datasets, respectively. The testing dataset CCR was improved using 20 selected features by the chi-square test feature selection method up to 98.10%, which was better than the modeling results with all extracted features. Results also revealed that by using image processing and texture features extraction methods, it was possible to identify the classification of different wheat varieties with over 95% accuracy.

Tomato crop was grown in a semi-closed greenhouse equipped with horizontal ventilation and sidewall curtains, which were only opened depending on microclimate conditions; and a naturally ventilated greenhouse equipped with sidewalls curtains that were kept open. Both greenhouses had a 1,000-m(2) area and a net size of 50-mesh, and were located in an arid climate zone in Israel. Vertical profiles of CO2 concentration, actual vapor pressure, air, leaf and soil temperature, net CO2 assimilation rates, stomatal conductance, and total fruit yield, fresh mass, and quality were monitored in both greenhouses for 13 days, in January 2018; CO2 concentration, actual vapor pressure, and air and soil temperature were additionally monitored in the semi-closed greenhouse for seven days in December 2016, when the ventilation was inoperative, and in December 2017, with ventilation. The vertical air temperature gradient, along with the colder microclimate inside the naturally ventilated greenhouse, led to a lack of plant uniformity and yield loss. Closing the side curtains in the fanned semi-closed greenhouse had a beneficial effect on yield, however, with mixed results for quality, due to the higher air temperature and lower carbon dioxide levels at the upper canopy. Horizontal air circulation in the semi-closed greenhouse increased transpiration and assimilation, and increased dew occurrence at night, but did not reduce the vertical heterogeneity. Significant vertical gradients affect plant physiology, and closing the curtains in winter cultivation in semi-arid/arid climates has the potential to improve fruit yield and quality. However, it must be coupled with proper air circulation and, preferably, with CO2 enrichment, or careful management of natural ventilation through side curtains, in order to maximize CO2 replenishment while minimizing heat losses.

J	Qu, HC; Heifetz, A; Seifan, M				Qu, Hongchun; Heifetz, Aviad; Seifan, Merav			Batesian mimicry or general food deception? An evolutionary game between plants for pollinator services	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY												Floral food deception is a well-known phenomenon which is not thoroughly understood. Particularly, it is unclear what drives a plant towards Batesian mimicry or towards generalized food deception. We analysed the evolutionary game between a Model species with nectar-secreting flowers and a Deceiver species that provides no nectar who share pollinators for reproduction. We focused our analysis on the effect of similarity of floral signals between participating plants and on costs of nectar production. We defined payoffs in the game between Models and Deceivers as the stationary visitation frequencies to participating species with different signal similarities and nectar costs. Therefore, fitness payoff of each strategy was a product of complex interactions between plant species composing the community and the pollinators visiting them. Our model provides a unified framework in which consequences of Model species interaction with different deception modes can be compared. Our findings suggest that plant-pollinator systems, like other mutualistic systems, are prone to exploitation, and that exploitation may persist at a large range of conditions. We showed that floral similarity, and thus, pollinators' ability to discriminate between Model and deceptive species, governs the stability of Batesian mimicry, while pollinator switching and sampling behaviour enables the persistence of general food deception.																			0022-5193	1095-8541				NOV 7	2023	575								111609	10.1016/j.jtbi.2023.111609	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2023.111609								37708988					WOS:001099704500001
J	Gidey, E; Mhangara, P				Gidey, Eskinder; Mhangara, Paidamwoyo			An Application of Machine-Learning Model for Analyzing the Impact of Land-Use Change on Surface Water Resources in Gauteng Province, South Africa	REMOTE SENSING												The change in land-use diversity is attributed to the anthropogenic factors sustaining life. The surface water bodies and other crucial natural resources in the study area are being depleted at an alarming rate. This study explored the implications of the changing land-use diversity on surface water resources by using a random forest (RF) classifier machine-learning algorithm and remote-sensing models in Gauteng Province, South Africa. Landsat datasets from 1993 to 2022 were used and processed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, using the RF classifier. The results indicate nine land-use diversity classes having increased and decreased tendencies, with high F-score values ranging from 72.3% to 100%. In GP, the spatial coverage of BL has shrunk by 100.4 km(2) every year over the past three decades. Similarly, BuA exhibits an annual decreasing rate of 42.4 km(2) due to the effect of dense vegetation coverage within the same land use type. Meanwhile, water bodies, marine quarries, arable lands, grasslands, shrublands, dense forests, and wetlands were expanded annually by 1.3, 2.3, 2.9, 5.6, 11.2, 29.6, and 89.5 km(2), respectively. The surface water content level of the study area has been poor throughout the study years. The MNDWI and NDWI values have a stronger Pearson correlation at a radius of 5 km (r = 0.60, p = 0.000, n = 87,260) than at 10 and 15 km. This research is essential to improve current land-use planning and surface water management techniques to reduce the environmental impacts of land-use change.

J	Liu, DD; She, DL				Liu, Dongdong; She, Dongli			Flow hydraulic characteristics and dynamic erodibility of saline-sodic soil slopes for coastal areas under simulated rainfall conditions	ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE												Tidal flat reclamation generates several excavated saline-sodic soil slopes. However, there are limited studies on the hydraulic flow characteristics and dynamic erodibility of saline-sodic soil slopes. This study was conducted to quantify the effects of the soil bulk density (1.35 and 1.40 g cm(-3)), rainfall intensity (85, 110, and 125 mm h(-1)), and slope gradient (11 degrees, 22 degrees, and 35 degrees) on the hydraulic characteristics and soil erodibility of saline-sodic soil slopes under simulated rainfall conditions. The mean sediment loss significantly increases with the slope gradient (pr = 0.9, p < 0.01), rainfall intensity (pr = 0.6, p < 0.05), and soil bulk density (pr = 0.6, p < 0.05). The hydraulic shear stress (tau) and stream power (omega) are good sediment loss predictors for all soil bulk densities (R-2 = 0.4 and 0.6). The stream power equation S-L = K-omega (omega - omega(cr) ) outperforms both hydraulic shear stress equations [S-L = K-tau (tau - tau(cr) )(3/2); S-L = K-tau (tau - tau(cr) )]. In most cases, the soil erodibility exponentially increases to a maximum and then exponentially decreases (R-2 > 0.6). Consequently, the dynamic changes in the saline-sodic soil erodibility during a rainfall event cannot be neglected.

However, new problems associated with food and river water resource security have arisen. Thus, to achieve sustainable development, it is critical to integrate agriculture and resource conservation with soil conservation. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to investigate the relationship between sediment load and water yield in the Yanhe watershed in the Loess Plateau. The results were as follows: (1) Sharp declines in agricultural land area (43.78%), water yield (38.48%) and sediment load (38.71%) have occurred since the implementation of the GfG project. (2) Based on the spatial heterogeneity of hydrological response units (HRUs), we proposed a simple method for land use planning that considers river water resources, agriculture and sediment loading and then established a balanced conservation scenario. Compared with the scenario in 2030 (planning scenario), the conservation scenario reduced the sediment yield by 6.4%, increased the water yield by 4.5%, and increased agricultural land by 80.1%. Our results can be used to support spatially targeted land use planning, which is beneficial for the sustainable development of the GfG project.

Reasonable and accurate quantification of the relationship between AGB and its driving factors is of great importance for increasing the biomass and function of forests. Remote sensing observations and field measurements can be used to estimate AGB in large areas. To explore the applicability of the panel data models in AGB and its driving factors, we compared the results of panel data models (spatial error model and spatial lag model) with those of geographically weighted regression (GWR) and ordinary least squares (OLS) to quantify the relationship between AGB and its driving factors. Furthermore, we estimated the tree height, diameter at breast height, canopy cover (CC) and species diversity index (Shannon-Wiener index) of Robinia pseudoacacia plantations in Changwu on the Loess Plateau using field data and remote sensing images by a random forest model and estimated soil organic carbon (SOC) contents using laboratory data by ordinary kriging (OK) interpolation. We estimated AGB using the already estimated tree height and diameter at breast height combined with the allometric growth equation. In this study, we estimated SOC contents by OK interpolation, and the accuracy R-2 values for each soil layer were greater than 0.81. We estimated diameter at breast height (DBH), CC, SW and tree height (TH) using the random forest, and the accuracy R-2 values were 0.85, 0.82, 0.76 and 0.68, respectively. We estimated AGB with random forest and the allometric growth equation and found that the average AGB was 55.80 t/ha. The OLS results showed that the residuals of the OLS regression exhibited obvious spatial correlations and rejected OLS applications. GWR, SEM and SLM were used for spatial regression analysis, and SEM was the best model for explaining the relationship between AGB and its driving factors. We also found that AGB was significantly positively correlated with CC, SW, and 0-60 cm SOC content (p < 0.05) and significantly negatively correlated with slope aspect (p < 0.01). This study provides a new idea for studying the relationship between AGB and its driving factors and provides a basis for practical forest management, increasing biomass, and giving full play to the role of carbon sequestration.																				2072-4292				JUN	2022	14	12							2842	10.3390/rs14122842	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14122842													WOS:000818284000001

The combination of climatic features and anthropogenic pressures leads to increased salinity and contamination of cultivated soils in this region, resulting in a qualitative and quantitative decline in crop production. The study's primary goal was to assess soil secondary salinity and selected heavy metals (Pb, Zn, Cd, Ni and Cu) contamination in irrigated arable soils. To identify the potential source of soil pollution, we compared the concentration of salt and heavy metals (both total and mobile forms) in different soil types in three depths of soil profiles obtained from irrigated cultivated and non-cultivated (abounded) territory in the Shauldara massif in the southern part of Kazakhstan. All studied soils are prone to secondary salinization with either a medium or high content of sum of salts with domination by Na+ among cations and by SO42- among anions. The soil contamination with heavy metals was low, and, in most cases, except for cadmium, it was below the limits developed for arable soils in most countries. Soil contamination with cadmium results from contamination of the water used for irrigation of farmland.

We used the co-inoculation of the PGPR Paenibacillus mucilaginosus and the metal-resistant rhizobium Sinorhizobium meliloti for exploring the physiological and biochemical responses of the plant-soil system in metal-contaminated soil. The co-inoculation with the PGPR and rhizobium significantly increased the nutrient (N, P, and K) contents in plant tissues and promoted plant growth in soil contaminated with copper (Cu). Stress from Cu-induced reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation were largely attenuated by the co-inoculation by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes. The contents and uptake of Cu in plant tissues increased significantly in the co-inoculation treatment compared with the uninoculated control and individual inoculation treatment. Co-inoculation with PGPR and rhizobium significantly increased soil microbial biomass, enzymatic activities, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and soil organic matter contents compared with the uninoculated control. Interestingly, co-inoculation also affected the composition of the rhizospheric microbial community, and slightly increased rhizospheric microbial diversity. These improvements of the soil fertility and biological activity also had a beneficial impact on plant growth under Cu stress. Our results suggested that alfalfa co-inoculated with PGPR and rhizobium could increase plant growth and Cu uptake in metal-contaminated soil by alleviating plant Cu stress and improving soil biochemical properties. These results indicate that the co-application of PGPR and rhizobium can have a positive effect on the biochemical responses of alfalfa-soil systems in soil contaminated by heavy metals and can provide an efficient strategy for the phytomanagement of metal-contaminated land.

Methods A 4-year field experiment with three levels of irrigation (high, 400 mm; medium, 300 mm; and low, 200 mm) and two levels of fertilization (high, 600 kg/ha P2O5 + 300 kg/ha urea; and low, 300 kg/ha P2O5 + 150 kg/ha urea) was conducted to investigate the microbial metabolic status in an arid agroecological system in China using the model of extracellular enzymatic stoichiometry. Results Higher C-acquisition enzyme activity and lower N-acquisition enzyme activity were observed during the crop growth stage, suggesting promoted C limitation and alleviated N limitation for microbes by the combination of medium irrigation and low fertilization. Increased microbial C limitation surged the abundance of amoA-AOA and amoA-AOB genes involved in nitrification and strengthened this process. Decreased microbial N limitation hindered the denitrification potential by reducing the abundance of the involved nirK, nirS, nosZ, and narG genes. Increased microbial C limitation was due to the elevated soil water content, which further promoted the activity of C-acquiring enzymes and facilitated microbial decomposition of organic matter. The decreased microbial N limitation was largely related to the increased soil N availability. Conclusions These findings suggest that a combination of medium irrigation and low fertilization is effective for organic matter decomposition, by promoting microbial C metabolism and reducing the risk of N loss via alleviation of microbial N limitation. Our results emphasize the roles of stoichiometry-regulated microbial metabolism in soil nutrient transformation and have implications for agricultural practices in arid fertigation agroecosystems.

The objective of this study was to measure the HRQOL and associated socioeconomic characteristics as well as test the reliability of the Amharic version of SF-8 (eight-item short form of HRQOL survey). A cross-sectional study was employed in three agroecologically different sites in rural Ethiopia, involving 270 household heads (218 male and 52 female) with a mean age +/- standard deviation of 49 +/- 12.88 years. The survey material consisted of a structured questionnaire for socioeconomic characteristics and SF-8 for HRQOL. The mean physical and mental component summary score of the whole sample was 30.50 +/- 12.18 and 34.40 +/- 7.26, respectively, well underneath the instrument average of 50. The SF-8 items showed excellent internal consistency in terms of both Cronbach's alpha coefficients and item-total correlation. In stepwise multiple linear regression, the low-income group had worse self-perceived physical health than the higher-income groups. Likewise, a diversified livelihood had a profound influence on positive self-perceived physical health. These findings imply that developing and distributing wide-ranging socioeconomic and public health policies is crucial for effective health promotion in rural communities.

Crust formation affects soil erosion by raindrop impacted flow through changing particle size and cohesion between particles on the soil surface, as well as surface microtopography. Therefore, changes in soil microtopography can, in theory, be employed as a proxy to reflect the complex and dynamic interactions between crust formation and erosion caused by raindrop-impacted flow. However, it is unclear whether minor variations of soil microtopography can actually be detected with tools mapping the crust surface, often leaving the interpretation of interrill runoff and erosion dynamics qualitative or even speculative. Methods. In this study, we used a laser scanner to measure the changes of the microtopography of two soils placed under simulated rainfall in experimental flumes and crusting at different rates. The two soils were of the same texture, but under different land management, and thus organic matter content and aggregate stability. To limit the amount of scanning and data analysis in this exploratory study, two transects and four subplots on each experimental flume were scanned with a laser in one-millimeter interval before and after rainfall simulations. Results. While both soils experienced a flattening, they displayed different temporal patterns of crust development and associated erosional responses. The laser scanning data also allowed to distinguish the different rates of developments of surface features for replicates with extreme erosional responses. The use of the laser data improved the understanding of crusting effects on soil erosional responses, illustrating that even limited laser scanning provides essential information for quantitatively exploring interrill erosion processes.																			2167-8359					JAN 31	2020	8								e8487	10.7717/peerj.8487	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.8487								32042512					WOS:000510385900005

In this study, we evaluated plant functional groups, soil properties, microbial communities, and their functional groups in four types of meadows (grazed, fenced, fenced + reseeded, and intact) in the Tibetan Plateau. Based on amplicon sequencing data, both the bacterial and fungal composition, their potential functions and their possible drivers have been investigated. Fencing was the most effective approach to restore degraded alpine meadows, characterized by higher aboveground biomass, soil nutrient levels, and microbial diversity. The soil carbon, ammonium nitrogen, and the above- and below-ground biomass (mainly sedge and grass groups) were closely related to the changes in bacterial and fungal composition, while the diversity of sedge, grass, legumes, and forbs was largely associated with N cycling and fungal functional guilds. Grazing-to-fencing conversion also caused changes in the microbial community composition, specifically resulting in a shift from oligotrophs to copiotrophs, an increased abundance of diazotrophs and plant pathogens, and a decreased abundance of nitrifiers. Our results revealed the effects of grazing-to-fencing conversion on an alpine meadow and can provide significant guidance for the sustainable management of degraded grassland ecosystems.

J	Fu, W; Wang, X; Wei, XR				Fu, Wei; Wang, Xiang; Wei, Xiaorong			No response of soil N mineralization to experimental warming in a northern middle-high latitude agro-ecosystem	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The effect of warming on soil nitrogen (N) pools and turnover in agro-ecosystems has rarely been investigated, particularly in middle-high latitudes where the temperature is predicted to increase more than that in low latitudes. In this study, we determined the dynamics of soil inorganic N pools and the net Nmineralization in an agro-ecosystem from 2013 to 2015 in a field warming experiment in Northeast China. The objectives were to examine the effects of warming on soil N turnover and determine how the effects differ in the growing versus the non-growing seasons. We hypothesized that experimental warming would increase N mineralization and the inorganic N pools, and the effects of warming would be greater in the non-growing season than those in the growing season. In contrast to these predictions, the soil N mineralization and inorganic N pools in the soil solution were not affected by experimental warming either within or across year and season. The nitrification rate was 0.14 mg kg(-1) d(-1) higher, but the ammonification rate was 0.17mg kg(-1) d(-1) lower in the growing season than that in the non-growing season. When averaged across all sources of variation, the net mineralization rate of the soil N was 0.09 mg kg(-1) d(-1) in both the control andwarming treatments, while the total inorganic N in the soil solution was 34 and 41 mg kg(-1), respectively. Both the nitrification and ammonification processes were regulated by soil moisture and/or root biomass, which was not affected by warming. These results suggest that soil N turnover and availability will be less sensitive to future global warming in this middle-high latitude agro-ecosystem.

We partitioned the effect of meteorological trends from anthropogenic drivers on annual streamflow, quantified the effect of annual streamflow decline on waterbird abundance, estimated the effects of streamflow change on a measure of ecosystem resilience, and calculated the net benefits of in-stream water reallocation. The anthropogenic drivers of hydrological droughts were assessed by comparing the Lower Darling (hereafter the Barka) River, which has large recorded water extractions, with the adjacent Paroo River, which has very little recorded water extractions. Findings include: (1) only about one-third of the recent reduced streamflow of the Barka River is due to a meteorological drying trend; (2) statistically significant declines in waterbird species richness and abundance have occurred on both rivers between 1983-2000 and 2001-2020; (3) declines in waterbird abundance have been much larger along the Barka River than the Paroo River; and (4) ecosystem resilience, as measured by waterbird abundance, wasgreater on the Paroo River. Our four-step framework is applicable in any catchment with adequate time-series data and supports adaptive responses to hydrological droughts.This article is part of the Royal Society Science+ meeting issue 'Drought risk in the Anthropocene'.					; Grafton, Quentin/A-5277-2008	Chu, Long/0000-0002-2954-0575; Kingsford, Richard/0000-0001-6565-4134; Grafton, Quentin/0000-0002-0048-9083													1364-503X	1471-2962				DEC 12	2022	380	2238							20210296	10.1098/rsta.2021.0296	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2021.0296													WOS:000876505100006

However, the mechanism of their impact on soil detachment is still unclear. Therefore, this study examined the following combinations of typical grass-shrub sample plots on the Loess Plateau: Caragana korshinskii (JJ), C. korshinskii and Agropyron cristatum (JC), C. korshinskii and Bothriochloa ischaemum (JB), and C. korshinskii and Artemisia gmelinii (JH). The variation characteristics of the soil detachment rate with depth (0-30 cm) and at different locations (0 cm, 50 cm) from the base of shrubs under a fixed flow rate and slope were explored. The spatial heterogeneity of the detachment rate in the grass-shrub plots was strong. In different plots, the soil detachment rate at 50 cm from the base of the shrub was relatively low. The ability of root length to reduce the detachment rate varied. In the JJ sample plot, the root length at the shrub base had a relatively strong ability to reduce the detachment rate, while it showed the opposite trend in the other plots. The ability to reduce the detachment rate was higher in the JC and JB plots at 0-5 cm than in the JH plots. However, at 20-30 cm, the opposite trend was observed. Overall, with the exception of the JC plots, the soil detachment rate in the other mixed plots was lower than that in single-species plots. In this study, soil aggregates and root length density were the main factors affecting the soil detachment rate. The combination of the two could also better calculate the soil detachment rate (R2 = 0.80). Compared with traditional regression methods, the back propagation neural network model had a relatively high R2 (0.86) when predicting the soil detachment rate. This study revealed the mechanisms underlying differences in soil detach-ment capacity in different grass-shrub sample plots.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				AUG	2023	229								107221	10.1016/j.catena.2023.107221	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.107221		MAY 2023											WOS:001009122800001

Prescribed small-ruminant foraging is considered a sustainable, cost-effective strategy, but demonstrating a link between animal presence and vegetation change is challenging. This study tested whether the effect of small-ruminant herd presence in Mediterra-nean woodlands can be detected by integrating remote sensing and herd tracking at the landscape scale. The daily for-aging routes of seven shepherded goat herds that exploited a 100-km2 forested area of the Judean Hills, Israel, were tracked over six years using GPS (Global Positioning System) collars. Herd locations were converted to stocking rates, with units of animal-presence-days per unit area per defined time period, and mapped at a spatial resolution of 10 m. We estimated pixel-level vegetation cover change based on a time series of 63 monthly Landsat-8 images expressed as the normalized soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI). Spatiotemporal trend analysis assessed the magni-tude and direction of change, and a random forest machine-learning algorithm estimated the relative impact on veg-etation cover change of environmental factors as well as the herd-related factors of stocking rate that accrued over six years and distance to the closest corral. The last two factors were among the most influential factors determining veg-etation cover change in the regional and individual-herd analyses. In some respects, the permanent herds differed in their spatial pattern of stocking rate from the mobile herds that periodically relocated their night corral throughout the year, but stocking rate scaled logarithmically for all herds individually and combined. The combination of multi-season GPS tracking, remote sensing, and machine-learning techniques, applied at a regional scale, detected herd impacts on vegetation cover trends, consistent with livestock foraging being an effective tool for fuel reduction in Mediterranean woodlands.

At present, sensitivity to heat stress remains one of the least understood aspects of wheat genetics and breeding, and measures for preventing heat stress are understudied. In this study, we used three cultivars of winter wheat (GY2018, SL02-1 and SY20) to evaluate the effect of heat stress at different days after anthesis (DAA) on yield and quality. Heat stability of the cultivars were analyzed and evaluated for the effects of two kinds of regulators on wheat under heat stress conditions. Heat treatment at 7 DAA led to the most substantial reduction in yield while GY2018 had the best heat stability with respect to yield, and demonstrated the most positive effects on several quality traits including protein content, sedimentation volume and glutenin and gliadin contents. Heat treatment at 14 DAA had the least reduction in yield, while SY20 had the best heat stability with respect to yield and heat treatment had minimal effects on quality. Heat treatment at 21 DAA had only a limited effect on yield, while SL02-1 had the best heat stability with respect to yield, but it showed the most negative effects on quality. Stable time at 14 DAA and protein content at 21 DAA can be used as indicators for detecting the stability of quality under heat stress. Among the three studied cultivars, SY20 was the most sensitive to heat stress with the stable time decreasing from 26.4 to 9.1 min, a higher sedimentation volume at 7 DAA, and a lower ?-gliadin content which increased 2.4 -fold under high -temperature treatment. The addition of various regulators had different effects: potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) was more protective of yield with heat stress at 7 DAA, while Duntianbao (DTB) had better effects on quality with heat stress at 21 DAA.

However, the changes in microbial communities and functions during the GWT drawdown are unclear, which hinders the predictive power of biogeo-chemical processes across the desertification. Here, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, PICRUSt2 and qPCR were used to in-vestigate soil prokaryotic diversity, composition and nitrogen cycling gene abundance at four vegetation types [flooded swamp (FS), drained swamp (DS), desert grassland (DG), and bare sandy land (BS)] along a GWT decline gra-dient in the Mu Us Desert, northern China. Results showed that prokaryotic Shannon and Chao1 indexes were signif-icantly reduced at BS than those at FS (p < 0.05). Whereas no significant difference was observed between FS, DS and DG (p > 0.05). Distinct shifts in community composition were found along the GWT decline gradient. The dominant taxa gradually changed from obligate anaerobes and eutrophic microbes to facultative anaerobes, and finally to aero-bic, oligotrophic and drought-tolerant microbes. Soil moisture was the most important factor in regulating the commu-nities. In addition, GWT drawdown inhibited the relative abundance of genes involved in nitrogen fixation, assimilatory nitrite reduction, and nitrate oxidation, but enhanced the relative abundance of genes related to denitri-fication, assimilated nitrate reduction, ammonia oxidation and ammonification. Thus, GWT drawdown inhibits nitro-gen input potential and exacerbates nitrogen loss potential. These results help in understanding the succession characteristics of desert wetland desertification.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				OCT 10	2022	842								156868	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156868	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156868								35752234					WOS:000823233100017

M-root, root failure moment of force equals to moment arm times max root side-pulling force measured in situ by means of the digital pole dynamometer, and M-wind, wind resultant moment of force is estimated with vertical leaf area distribution and wind speed. Two maize cultivars were examined at 5 different growth stages from V8 to physiological maturity in 2019 and 2020, in Qingdao, China. Root anti-lodging index in tested cultivars fluctuated to a small extent within any year during whole growth period excluding at V8, while there was an inter-annual shift in index means (1.23 vs 0.84). Both root failure moment and wind resultant moment increased first and then decreased with the growth stage, and their influences on root anti-lodging index varied with the year. At wind grade 6, effect sizes, as contribution to root anti-lodging index, of root moment and wind moment were respectively 0.88 and 0.98. The difference in anti-lodging index between cultivars seemed to be disappearing as wind grade goes up. Root failure moment of force positively related to single root tensile resistance, root-soil ball volume, root number and total root length, whose correlation coefficient was the maximum of 0.94. Root anti-lodging index of maize proved stable from V8 on during whole growth period, and vertical leaf area distribution played a substantial role in maize root lodging in terms of wind resultant moment. Our findings provide the insights into root lodging events in crops such as maize, and would serve an approach to assessing crop root lodging resistance in breeding and cultivation programs.																			2045-2322					JUN 20	2022	12	1							10375	10.1038/s41598-022-14159-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-14159-0								35725757					WOS:000838090200023

To determine whether H2O2, Ca2+, and K+ in subsidiary cells were involved in stomatal movement, we treated four-week-old maize (Zhengdan 958) leaves with H2O2, diphenylene iodonium (DPI), CaCl2, and LaCl3. Changes in content and distribution of H2O2, Ca2+, and K+ during stomatal movement were observed. When exogenous H2O2 was applied, Ca2+ increased and K+ decreased in guard cells, while both ions increased in subsidiary cells, leading to stomatal closure. After DPI treatment, Ca2+ decreased and K+ increased in guard cells, but both Ca2+ and K+ decreased in subsidiary cells, resulting in open stomata. Exogenous CaCl2 increased H2O2 and reduced K+ in guard cells, while significantly increasing them in subsidiary cells and causing stomatal closure. After LaCl3 treatment, H2O2 decreased and K+ increased in guard cells, whereas both decreased in subsidiary cells and stomata became open. Results indicate that H2O2 and Ca(2+ )correlate positively with each other and with K+ in subsidiary cells during stomatal movement. Both H2O2 and Ca2+ in subsidiary cells promote an inflow of K+, indirectly regulating stomatal closure.																			0981-9428	1873-2690				JUL	2020	152						243	251		10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.04.045	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.04.045								32449683					WOS:000536123200024
J	Li, XT; Zhang, FB; He, Q; Yang, MY				Li, Xuantian; Zhang, Fengbao; He, Qing; Yang, Mingyi			Correspondence analysis between vegetation cover and sheet erosion rate on an abandoned farmland slope based on 7Be measurement	CATENA												Scale effects, the phenomena of runoff and sediment yield differ from different spatial and temporal scales, exist in the whole process of soil erosion. Vegetation cover can reduce the degree of soil erosion at the plot and slope scales, but there is little research on the reduction effect of vegetation on soil erosion at a specific point on the plot, due to the limitations of traditional methods. Based on in situ sampling on a representatively abandoned farmland slope, the corresponding relationship between vegetation and sheet erosion was analyzed quantitatively using the modified 7Be tracing model with vegetation factor. The results showed that 7Be activity per unit mass and per unit area in soil ranged from 2.45 to 27.05 Bq kg- 1 and 50.09 to 528.11 Bq m- 2, and in plants ranged from 378.20 to 691.82 Bq kg -1 and 72.61 to 307.33 Bq m- 2, respectively. Plants were responsible for 22.6 %+/- 7.3 % of total 7Be interception on the slope, affected by vegetation coverage, leaf area index, dry biomass and flesh weight. Plants were mainly distributed on the backslope and toeslope, with vegetation coverage, leaf area index, dry biomass and flesh weight ranging from 0.26 to 0.75, 0.48 to 2.45, 0.17 to 0.45 kg m- 2 and 0.38 to 0.85 kg m- 2, respectively, while the peak area of soil erosion was concentrated on the backslope, with a rate ranging from 0.06 to 16.76 kg m- 2. At the specific point scale, the corresponding relationships between soil erosion and vegetation coverage, leaf area index, dry biomass, and flesh weight of plants are not as significant as in the previous study at the plot or slope scale. This indicates that the reduction of erosion for plants varies with scale dependency, which is more complicated at the specific point scale, rather than simply decreasing with the increase of vegetation. Our results highlight that there is a scale effect of plants on soil erosion, and the 7Be measurement is of great potential to explore this effect at the specific point scale.

J	Yang, YF; Wu, J; Bai, L; Wang, B				Yang, Yanfen; Wu, Jing; Bai, Lei; Wang, Bing			Reliability of Gridded Precipitation Products in the Yellow River Basin, China	REMOTE SENSING												Gridded precipitation products are the potential alternatives in hydrological studies, and the evaluation of their accuracy and potential use is very important for reliable simulations. The objective of this study was to investigate the applicability of gridded precipitation products in the Yellow River Basin of China. Five gridded precipitation products, i.e., Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP), CPC Morphing Technique (CMORPH), Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis 3B42, and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN), were evaluated against observations made during 2001-2014 at daily, monthly, and annual scales. The results showed that MSWEP had a higher correlation and lower percent bias and root mean square error, while CMORPH and GSMaP made overestimations compared to the observations. All the datasets underestimated the frequency of dry days, and overestimated the frequency and the intensity of wet days (0-5 mm/day). MSWEP and TRMM showed consistent interannual variations and spatial patterns while CMORPH and GSMaP had larger discrepancies with the observations. At the sub-basin scale, all the datasets performed poorly in the Beiluo River and Qingjian River, whereas they were applicable in other sub-basins. Based on its superior performance, MSWEP was identified as more suitable for hydrological applications.

An understanding of drought tolerance mechanisms offers guidance for cultivar improvement. In order to understand how a well-known wheat genotype Jinmai 47 responds to drought, we adopted the iTRAQ and LC/MS approaches and conducted proteomics analysis of leaves after exposure to 20% of polyethylene glycol-6000 (PEG)-induced stress for 4 days. The study identified 176 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), with 65 (36.5%) of them being up-regulated, and 111 (63.5%) down-regulated. DEPs, located in cellular membranes and cytosol mainly, were involved in stress and redox regulation (51), carbohydrate and energy metabolism (36), amino acid metabolism (24), and biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites (20) primarily. Under drought stress, TCA cycle related proteins were up-regulated. Antioxidant system, signaling system, and nucleic acid metabolism etc. were relatively weakened. In comparison, the metabolism pathways that function in plasma dehydration protection and protein structure protection were strongly enhanced, as indicated by the improved biosynthesis of 2 osmolytes, sucrose and Proline, and strongly up-regulated protective proteins, LEA proteins and chaperones. SUS4, P5CSs, OAT, Rab protein, and Lea14-A were considered to be important candidate proteins, which deserve to be further investigated.

In this study, the effect of MEL application on winter wheat seedling growth and grain yield were investigated in hydroponic and pot experiments at different N levels. The result showed that application of 1 mu M MEL in hydroponic solution significantly improved the wheat seedling growth under both N sufficient and deficient conditions, but the effect of MEL on promoting seedling growth was prominent under N deficient condition. Meanwhile, MEL-treated plants maintained higher N contents and nitrate nitrogen levels in shoot under N deficient condition, and also maintained higher nitrate nitrogen levels in root. Further investigation showed that nitrate reductase (NR) and glutamine synthetase (GS) activities were higher in MEL-treated plants than that of MEL-untreated plants under N deficiency. The N absorption calculated based on N contents and biomass showed that MEL could promote the N absorption under N deficient condition. In pot experiment, pre-soaking of seeds with 100 mu M MEL enhanced per-plant yield by 16% under N sufficient condition and 23% under N deficient condition. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that MEL is involved in promoting N uptake and assimilation through up-regulating the activities of N uptake and metabolism related enzymes and, ultimately, promotes the plant growth and yield, especially under N deficient condition.

Under the programme, the profitability of seed growing farmers is important as it incentivizes them to grow more seed for distribution of seed to other farmers. This paper tried to analyze the impact of the seed village programme on profitability of seed growing farmers of paddy crop by using Difference-in-Difference approach. The study was conducted during the year 2020 in India. A significant increase in profitability of seed growing farmers compared to non-seed farmers was noticed due to the SVP scheme. It was observed that after the introduction of SVP, there was about 69.01% increase in profits of seed-farmers compared to only 5.63% among non-seed-farmers. Age, education, acreage under seed production and farming experience contributed 71.6% of the total variation in the higher profits through SVP in paddy crop, leaving the rest to extraneous factors. The difference-in-difference regression results showed that, with the introduction of the SVP in India, there was an increase in the profits of seed growing farmers by INR 13,032/acre (186 USD). These results show that most of the seed growing farmers are in favor of the growing seed under SVP and benefited from this programme.

J	Li, GQ; Huang, JH				Li, Guoqing; Huang, Jinghua			Multi-Directional Rather Than Unidirectional Northward-Dominant Range Shifts Predicted under Climate Change for 99 Chinese Tree Species	FORESTS												Climate change has a profound impact on the distribution of species on Earth. At present, there are two contrasting views explaining the direction of species range shifts. One is a single poleward (northward in the Northern Hemisphere) view, while the other is a multi-directional view (e.g., westward, southward, and eastward). Exploring the universality of these two views has become a key focus in climate change ecology. Here, we study the habitat range shift velocity of 99 tree species in China under future climate change scenarios using a bioclimatic envelope model (also called species distribution model) and a climate velocity method. A Monte Carlo method is used to test the consistency between the range shift pattern and stochastic process, and confusion matrices and kappa values are calculated to evaluate the consistency between the bioclimatic envelope model and climate velocity method. The results indicate that the tree species in China are generally expected to shift northwards, with northwest and northeast directions accounting for a larger proportion. The northward-shifting species are mainly distributed in the east monsoon region of China, while the multi-directional shifting species are mainly distributed in the alpine and arid regions of China. The shift directions described by the bioclimatic envelope model are inconsistent with those described by the climate velocity method. The results imply that the tree species in China support the view of the northward shift pattern but, more specifically, should be considered in terms of a multi-directional northward shift pattern. The results also emphasize that the inter-species variation in climate tolerance has been largely ignored in physical-based climate velocity methods. The development of a biological and vector operation-based climate velocity indicator may be more useful in characterizing the range shifts of species, compared to existing physical and scalar operation-based climate velocity indicators. This study provides favorable evidence for the pattern of climate change-induced range shifts in China, as well as in Eastern Asia.

Ryan; Kallenbach, Robert L.; Yuan, Zhiyou			Fractional coverage rather than green chromatic coordinate is a robust indicator to track grassland phenology using smartphone photography	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Cost-effective and accurate methods are critical in monitoring grassland phenology. Smartphones have great potential for tracking phenological changes owing to their easy operation and flexible sampling, especially for experimental treatments on grassland phenology at local scale. However, it remains an open question for an accurate and robust measure in tracking plant phenology under various light conditions when using smart phones. To fill this gap, we compared green chromatic coordinate (GCC) and fractional coverage (FC) produced by three widely-used smartphone types across varying light conditions. We also explored the effects of experimental warming and N addition on grassland spring phenology using smartphone photography. We found that light conditions affected GCC values derived from various smartphones. The percentile method did not reduce the influence of various light conditions on GCC calculation. When using one type of smartphone, other techniques (e.g., shading strong sunlight) were required to minimize the effect of light on mean GCC during photography, but they did not work for FC. Based on this method, three smartphone types generated similar phenological metrics (i.e., start, peak and end of growing season) detected from GCC or FC. GCC and FC produced synchronous seasonal trajectories and similar phenological metrics throughout the growing season. We also found that experimental warming advanced spring phenology in the relatively wet year of 2018, but delayed it in the dry year of 2019. In contrast, N addition had little influence on spring phenology. Our results revealed that overlooking the influence of ambient light and smartphone types on GCC might lead to uncertainties in phenological measurement. Robust FC metrics extracted from smartphone photography detected grassland phenology differences in response to warming and N deposition. These findings provide evidence that FC is a robust indicator to accurately monitor grassland phenology using smartphone photography. Their utility resonates with those monitoring many experimental plots or sites with various light conditions.																			1574-9541	1878-0512				MAY	2022	68								101544	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.101544	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.101544													WOS:000793038300001

However, the contributions of bacterial and fungal communities to the multiple soil functions of alpine meadow ecosystems have not been widely examined. Here, we surveyed the soil in Qinghai-Tibetan alpine meadows and classified the extent of degradation as undegraded, lightly degraded, moderately degraded, and severely degraded to clarify the associations between microbial diversity (including bacteria and fungi) and potential soil multifunctionality. Bacterial and fungal compositions were detected by sequencing of the 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer amplicons, respectively. Functions associated with nutrient cycling (dissolved organic nitrogen and carbon, available phosphorus, NO3-, NH4+, C, N, P-cycle enzymes) and climate regulation (CO2 and N2O emissions) were also examined. Bacterial, rather than fungal, richness was negatively associated with potential soil multifunctionality, which decreased along the degradation gradient. Structural equation modeling explained 79.6% of the variation in potential soil multifunctionality and confirmed that, in addition to bacterial community richness and composition, organic carbon and moisture were important drivers of potential soil multifunctionality. These results suggest that higher bacterial richness is associated with lower potential soil multifunctionality in alpine meadow ecosystems. Among the bacterial taxa, only similar to 12% of bacterial genera were identified as predictors of multifunctionality, suggesting functional redundancy of the bacterial community in the meadow ecosystem. Rhodanobacter, Mucilaginibacter, Rhodococcus, and Bosea, belonging to the Proteobacteria and the Actinobacteria phyla were identified as critical for maintaining potential soil multifunctionality. Our results suggest that bacterial richness is negatively related to potential soil multifunctionality in alpine meadow ecosystems and there is no correlation between potential multifunctionality and fungal richness.

A cross-sectional household survey of randomly selected respondents was conducted and analysed using a coping strategy index and descriptive analysis. The results revealed that most of the respondents lost their livelihoods due to the war and siege. The study also confirmed that households with the pre-war occupations of government employee, handcrafter, daily labourer, and metal- and woodworker suffered the most. The study concludes that the siege has interrupted the livelihoods of the people in Mekelle City and most of them are waiting for humanitarian food aid. This study advises households to diversify their income sources to cope with man-made shocks and thereby reduce risk. It also recommends that the international community intervene and support the warring parties to settle their political differences peacefully.

To understand how elemental interactions affect the cycle and storage of subsoil N, we examined the soils receiving no fertilizer control (CK), 30-year applications of synthetic fertilizer (CF), and CF plus organic manure (CF + OM). The N cycling microbial groups and activity were investigated through analyzing abundance of bacteria, nitrifiers and denitrifiers, potential nitrification (PNA) and denitrification (DEA) rates in the topsoil (0-20 cm) and subsoil depths (20-80 cm). Compared with the CK, the CF application increased subsoil nitrate but reduced or did not change subsoil microbial biomass N and total N. Corresponding to the increased nitrate, the abundances of denitrifiers increased in the CF subsoils. By contrast, the abundances of nitrifiers increased in the CF topsoil. Significant correlation between the abundances of nitrifiers and soil PNA was found in the topsoil, while significant correlation was also found in the subsoil between the abundances ofnirS- and/ornirK-type denitrifiers and DEA. These results suggest that the depleted or less changed subsoil total N by CF application might be partly related to the enriched denitrifiers groups and the related potential activity. The contrasting responses of nitrifiers and denitrifiers in the CF subsoil indicate a decoupling of both processes. Our findings highlight that the leached nitrate by synthetic fertilizer addition not only occurs as an environmental risk causing groundwater contamination but may also alter the subsoil N cycle through the denitrifier groups.

Socio-scientific contributions-including Anthropology-are scarce. This has resulted in a limited understanding of the socio-cultural dimensions of tipping point phenomena at the local level. This paper contributes to ongoing discussion and provides an ethnographic study of local perceptions of desertification tipping points (DTPs) amongst Ovaherero pastoralists in Namibia's semi-arid Okakarara constituency. Following a qualitative approach, this study shows that experienced farmers are aware of these phenomena and have accumulated extensive knowledge enabling them to identify and anticipate DTPs in different, complementary ways. The paper discusses how DTPs are managed in a communally farmed setting and presents the challenges that livestock farmers face in practical prevention of DTPs.

High amounts of plant litter are incorporated into the topsoil during such processes; however, their effects on soil erosion resistance under natural conditions are not fully understood. Therefore, the present study investigated seasonal variation in soil erosion resistance to overland flow and the underlying factors in the gully-filled farmland. Two typical plant litter species were selected in this study, i.e., Artemisia sacrorum Ledeb. (ASL) and Bothriochloa ischaemum (L.) Keng. (BIL). Overland water flow was tested under six shear stress levels (5.66-22.11 Pa) in natural soil samples incorporated with plant litter and without plant litter to determine soil erosion resistance parameters (rill erodibility K-r and critical shear stress tau(c)). The study was conducted over 524 days (through May 6, 2017, to October 11, 2018), covering two rainy seasons and one winter. Soil properties changed significantly over time, with physical crust thickness and cohesion increasing from 0 to 10.7 mm and 2.9-13.4 kPa, respectively. In contrast, the mass density of incorporated plant litter decreased from 0.7 to 0.2 kg m(-2). Soil erosion resistance increased with time, which showed that K-r decreased (from 0.516 to 0.021 s m(-1)) and tau(c) increased (from 0.49 to 7.98 Pa). Compared with the initial state of new farmland (K-r = 0.507 s m(-1),tau(c) = 0.48 Pa), K-r decreased by 77-96% and tic increased 8-14 times at the end of the study. Plant litter incorporation markedly enhanced soil erosion resistance in a time-and species-dependent manner. Compared with the bare soil without plant litter, the K-r values of ASL and BIL treatments were 3-64% and 2-83% lower, and their tic values were 0-81% and 0-55% higher, respectively. K-r was significantly and positively correlated with cumulative precipitation, cumulative rainfall kinetic energy, soil cohesion, and physical soil crust thickness, while tau(c) was negatively correlated with the influencing factors. Further, both K-r and tau(c) could be well predicted by physical soil crust thickness and cohesion (R-2 = 0.79 and 0.87, p < 0.01, n = 27). According to the results, seasonal patterns of soil erosion resistance in the gully-filled farmland established under plant litter incorporation were mainly controlled by rainfall and physical soil crust structure. This study provides a reference resource for soil erosion prediction in farmland ecosystems on the Loess Plateau.

However, wheat production is uncertain across the Loess Plateau, and its potential for yield improvement remains unknown. In the present study, we divided winter wheat growing areas on the Loess Plateau into four climatic zones: arid (zone I), semi-arid (zone II), semi-humid (zone III), and humid (zone IV). Then, we used the validated Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) to model Y-p (potential yield) and attainable yield (water-limited yield, Y-w; nitrogen-limited yield, Y-n) of winter wheat on the Loess Plateau from 1961 to 2016. The simulated means for weighted Y-p, Y-w, and Y-n were 8.87, 6.49, and 5.42 t ha(-1), respectively. Y-a reached only 57% of Y-p, which represents the amount of room available for yield improvement. Across the Loess Plateau, the yield gap caused by water limited (YGw) and nitrogen restricted (YGn) were 27% and 39% of potential wheat production. The difference between YGw (3.54 t ha(-1)) and YGn (3.87 t ha(-1)) was not significant in the semi-arid climate (zone II), due to low precipitation rates. Compared with irrigation, nitrogen deficiency was the key factor causing the winter wheat yield gap. However, the yield gap caused by nitrogen restriction varies regionally. Irrigation in arid (zone I) was more important than in the other climates, whereas these climate regions required nitrogen more pressing. Areas with a large potential for increased winter wheat yield on the Loess Plateau were mainly distributed in the semi-arid climate (zone II).					zhang, lingling/HDM-2189-2022														1735-6814	1735-8043				MAR	2022	16	1					1	15		10.1007/s42106-021-00170-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42106-021-00170-4		MAR 2022											WOS:000764444900001

In the past 20-30 years, large areas of apple orchards have been built in this region, which have resulted in excessive consumption of deep soil water and soil desiccation. To evaluate the effects of orchard development on deep soil water content (SWC), a meta-analysis of 162 sampling sites on the loess tableland from 44 peer-reviewed publications was conducted in this study. The results showed that the deep SWC in orchards depended on stand age, planting density and annual precipitation. In regions with 550-600 mm precipitation, the orchard with lower planting density showed no soil desiccation in young and early fruiting stages, while deep soil (>2 m) desiccation occurred in full fruiting and old orchards. The effect of planting density on deep SWC varied with stand age. There were significant differences in SWC among different planting densities in early fruiting orchards (p < 0.05), in which soil desiccation occurred in orchards with higher planting density. However, with the continuous consumption of soil water by apple trees, deep soil desiccation occurred in old orchards regardless of planting density. Further, affected by the spatial variation of annual precipitation, deep SWC in orchards significantly decreased with annual precipitation from 650 to 500 mm among the 44 study sites (p < 0.05). Our results suggest that the planting density should be reasonably regulated on the level of annual precipitation, and apple trees need to be pruned appropriately with a goal of moderate productivity, so as to achieve the sustainable use of regional water resources, food security and economic development.

(F-W) is the major cropping system for wheat production on the Loess Plateau of China. Integrating forage crops into the summer fallow season could improve crop yield, water productivity, and rainwater use efficiency, but this process is limited by the inter- and intra- annual variable precipitation. A 3-year (2016-2019) field experiment was conducted on the Loess Plateau to investigate the effects of fallow-winter wheat, oat (Avena sativa)-winter wheat (O-W), soybean (Glycine max)-winter wheat (SW), and vetch (Vicia sativa)-winter wheat (V-W) systems on dry matter yield, water use, water productivity, and precipitation use efficiency under three interannual rainfall scenarios: a 30% decrease in rainfall (R-30%), normal rainfall (CK), and a 30% increase in rainfall (R+30%) by a rainfall-collection-redistribution device. In 2017-2018, under the CK scenario, the F-W, O-W, S-W, and V-W system wheat yields were 3.39, 3.63, 4.30, and 3.24 t ha(-1), respectively, and the system yield values were 11.28, 16.72, 16.40, and 14.27 t ha(-1), respectively. Compared to the CK scenario, the F-W, O-W, S-W, and V-W system yields increased by 22.9%, 34.5%, 20.4%, and 33.8% in 2016-2017 under the R+ 30% scenario, but the system water productivity decreased by 19.9%, 41.8%, 19.6%, and 32.4% in 2017-2018 under the R-30% scenario. Compared to those of the F-W system, the O-W, S-W, and V-W system yields significantly increased by 48.2%, 45.4%, and 26.5%, respectively, and the system water productivity increased by 51.5%, 47.3%, and 25.17%, respectively, in 2017-2018 under the CK scenario. The system precipitation use efficiency also increased by 29.3%, 42.9%, and 28.9% in 2018-2019 under the R+ 30% scenario. Across the three growing seasons, the F-W system had the highest wheat yield in the dry growing season. The S-W system had the highest dry matter yield, water productivity, and precipitation use efficiency in the normal and wet growing seasons. Therefore, we recommend the F-W system for local farmers when considering saving more soil water and maintaining wheat yield in the dry growing season. In normal and wet growing seasons, we recommend the S-W system for local farmers considering that the system increases productivity and improves environmental sustainability.

J	Li, YY; Zhang, FB; Yang, MY; Zhang, JQ				Li, Yuanyuan; Zhang, Fengbao; Yang, Mingyi; Zhang, Jiaqiong			Effects of adding biochar of different particle sizes on hydro-erosional processes in small scale laboratory rainfall experiments on cultivated loessial soil	CATENA												Adding biochar to soil is an efficient method to improve soil physicochemical properties. Understanding the effect of this method on soil and water loss is also important. However, there is insufficient data available to assess this effect. Thus, a simulated rainfall (intensity 90 mm h(-1)) study was conducted to explore the effect of biochar particle sizes (2-1, 1-0.25, and < 0.25 mm) and incubation times (0 and 8 months) of biochar and soil mixture on soil and water loss. Our experiments consisted of measuring soil loss, surface runoff, > 2 mm water stable soil aggregate content, and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) from a perforated box (1 m long and 0.4 m wide) with a 27% slope gradient that contained soil, with a constant application rate of biochar at 1% (wt/wt). Soil without biochar was used as the control. The results indicated that biochar-treated soil delayed the time to runoff compared to the control by 12.67% to 32.58%, with the smallest particle size (< 0.25 mm) and 8 months incubation being the most effective. In general, all tested biochar particle sizes had some control on soil and water loss. The total runoff volume after biochar additions of 2-1, 1-0.25, and < 0.25 mm particle sizes decreased by 2.04%, 24.21%, and 29.63% and by 14.72%, 13.83%, and 30.76% with no incubation and 8 months of incubation, respectively, while the total erosion decreased by 12.86%, 34.30%, and 34.29% and by 20.41%, 11.85%, and 31.93% with no incubation and 8 months of incubation, respectively, compared to the control. Eight months of incubation could effectively decrease both the total runoff and amount of erosion only for soil amended with 2-1 mm biochar particles compared to those with no incubation. Furthermore, 2-1, 1-0.25, and < 0.25 mm biochar treatments could increase > 2 mm water-stable soil aggregate content and K-sat relative to the control. We speculated that the positive effects of biochar on soil and water loss were possibly due to an improvement in soil physical properties, such as an increase in the > 2 mm water-stable soil aggregate and K-sat.					li, yuanyuan/GZA-4435-2022	yang, ming yi/0000-0003-2574-552X													0341-8162	1872-6887				FEB	2019	173						226	233		10.1016/j.catena.2018.10.021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2018.10.021													WOS:000452814300022

Methods An indoor rainfall simulation experiment was conducted to analyze the straw effects on runoff, sediment yield and velocity under two straw mulching methods: straw surface mulch and straw incorporation. Under both methods, 4 straw rates (1.5, 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 t center dot hm(-2)) and 3 straw lengths (3-5, 8-10, and 13-15 cm) were considered, and a bare slope was selected as the control. Results Compared with the straw surface mulch, there was a lower runoff reduction effect and a higher sediment reduction effect under the straw incorporation. The straw factor contributions to runoff and sediment varied with the mulching method. Compared with the surface mulch, the straw rate generated a higher sediment yield contribution and a lower runoff yield contribution under the straw incorporation. Moreover, the effect of straw length on the flow velocity under the straw surface mulch was greater than that under straw incorporation. Straw reduced the sediment yield mainly by lowering the erosion kinetic energy under the straw surface mulch, while straw could largely reduce the soil erodibility under the straw incorporation. Under the straw surface mulch, the best runoff and sediment reduction effects were achieved when the straw rate reached 4.5 t center dot hm(-2) and the straw length ranged from 3-5 cm. Under straw incorporation, the best effects were achieved when the straw rate reached 3.5 t center dot hm(-2) and the straw length ranged from 8-10 cm. Conclusions In areas with greater rainfall, straw incorporation should be incorporated. In areas with less rainfall, straw surface mulch should be used. This study provides a reference for the selection of suitable straw mulching methods and an understanding the mechanisms by which straw reduces soil and water loss, on sloping farmland.

J	Luo, CY; Yang, JJ; Chen, W; Han, FP				Luo, Chaoyi; Yang, Jingjing; Chen, Wen; Han, Fengpeng			Effect of biochar on soil properties on the Loess Plateau: Results from field experiments	GEODERMA												Soil erosion on the Loess Plateau has been partly controlled, but soil nutrients remain limited throughout the region. Biochar amendments are an efficient method of improving availability of soil nutrients due to their strong adsorptive capacity; however, the effects of biochar amendments on different soil types on the Loess Plateau are not well understood. In this paper, we compared the effects of biochar on soil bulk density, soil organic carbon, and soil nitrogen and phosphorus contents among four soil types on the Loess Plateau. An eightyear field study was conducted in Loessal soil, Dark Loessial soil, Lou soil, and Aeolian sandy soil to investigate changes in soil bulk density and nutrient retention caused by biochar amendment at rates of 0 g/kg (control), 4 g/kg, 8 g/kg and 16 g/kg. Soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, ammonium nitrogen, and nitrate nitrogen concentrations were measured eight years after biochar application. The biochar amendments significantly increased the soil organic carbon and nitrate nitrogen concentrations in the 0-40 cm layer of all soils. The nitrate nitrogen concentration in the Lou soil and Dark Loessial soil decreased with 4 g/kg biochar application and increased significantly with 8 g/kg and 16 g/kg biochar application, but it did not significantly change in the Loessal soil. In contrast, the nitrate nitrogen concentration in the Aeolian sandy soil decreased with increasing biochar application. Biochar amendments did not significantly influence soil ammonium nitrogen in the 0-20 cm soil layer. However, the soil phosphorus content in the 0-20 cm layer decreased with increasing biochar application, except in the Lou soil and Aeolian sandy soil. These data suggest that biochar-soil interactions on the Loess Plateau have the potential to enhance soil organic carbon and soil nitrogen storage. Moreover, using an appropriate biochar amendment rate according to soil type might help optimise the use of fertilizer on the Loess Plateau.

However, the mechanisms governing the erosion and entrainment of mass movements remain poorly understood. In this study, experiments on natural loess slopes were conducted to induce a series of mass movements under simulated rainfalls in the Liudaogou Catchment on the Loess Plateau of China. A novel topography meter was used to observe random mass movements. A total of 499 mass movements in 42 rainfall events and an average of 11 mass movements for each rainfall event were observed. Three mass movement types were detected: landslides (67%) > mudflows (21%) > avalanches (12%). The volume of landslides dramatically increased through the entrainment of a wet gully bed material, and the volume of landslide mass was magnified by 29% on average through material entrainment. Based on the observed data, the probability of mass movement occurrences decreased with the increasing mass movement volume in a power-law relationship. The critical rainfall amount for mass movement failure was approximately 25.6 mm at a rainfall intensity of 50 mm h(-1) . These results can serve as guides to mitigate geological hazards and assess erosion processes on steep loess slopes of the Loess Plateau.

Drought priming has been proved to improve drought tolerance of plants at later growth stages, however, whether and how drought priming at early growth stage alleviating salinity stress at later growth stage and improving water use efficiency (WUE) of plants remains unknown. Therefore, two wheat cultivars were subjected to drought priming at the 4th and 6th leaf stage and subsequent moderate salinity stress at 100 mmol NaCl applied at the later jointing growth stage. The growth, physiological responses, ABA signaling and WUE were investigated to unravel the regulating mechanisms of drought priming on subsequent salinity stress. The results showed that drought priming imposed at the early growth stage improved the leaf and root water potential while attenuated the ABA concentration in the leaves ([ABA](leaf)) for the primed plants, which increased the stomatal conductance (g(s)) and photosynthesis (P-n). Consequently, the biomass under the salinity stress was significantly increased due to earlier drought priming. Moreover, drought priming improved the specific leaf N content due to the facilitated root growth and morphology, and this could benefit high leaf photosynthetic capacity during the salinity stress period, improving the P-n and water uptake for the primed plants. Drought priming significantly improved plant level WUE (WUEp) due to considerably enhanced dry biomass compared with non-primed plants under subsequent salinity stress. The significantly increased leaf delta C-13 under drought priming further demonstrated that the improved leaf delta C-13 and WUEp was mainly ascribed to the improvement of P-n. Drought primed plants significantly improved K-+/- concentration and maintained the K+/Na+ ratio compared with non-primed plants under subsequent salinity stress, which could mitigate the adverse effects of excess Na+ and minimize salt-induced ionic toxicity by improving salt tolerance for primed plants. Therefore, drought priming at early growth stage could be considered as a promising strategy for salt-prone areas to optimize agricultural sustainability and food security under changing climatic conditions.

A better understanding of its physiological and biochemical characteristics under drought-hot stress is requisite for its efficient cultivation in the arid and semi-arid areas. In this study, the physiological and biochemical responses of 3-month-old yellow-horn seedlings were evaluated after 7 days of treatments of five temperatures (25 degrees C/20 degrees C, 30 degrees C/25 degrees C, 35 degrees C/25 degrees C, 40 degrees C/25 degrees C and 45 degrees C/25 degrees C) under two watering conditions [adequate water supply (HW): 80 +/- 5% FC (field capacity); low water supply (LW): 40 +/- 5% FC] by a pot experiment. The increased temperature (above to 35 degrees C) markedly aggravated the damage on biomass accumulation and membrane integrity of yellow-horn seedlings under the LW. The accumulation of soluble sugars and proteins exhibited a growing trend as the temperature increased from 25 to 40 degrees C, which declined when the temperature was higher than 40 degrees C except for the soluble protein accumulation under HW. In addition, captured responsive characteristics of the gas-exchange parameters and chlorophyll fluorescence have indicated that the combinations of high temperature (above to 35 degrees C) and LW induced significant decrease in photosynthetic activities of yellow-horn seedlings. All these results showed that the hot stress significantly aggravated the drought damage on yellow-horn plant growth, especially when the temperature increased above 35 degrees C under drought stress.																			1863-5466	1863-5474				FEB	2020	14	1					111	120		10.1007/s11816-019-00590-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11816-019-00590-9													WOS:000514601500010

Salt stress develops at different rates in various plant organs and tissues, leading to osmotic and ionic stresses. We studied the development of salt stress (30 mM NaCl) in two grapevine rootstocks by examining the gas exchange, photochemistry, and salt accumulation of leaves at different ages. Our results indicate that leaf age strongly affected photosynthesis but had a minor effect on stomatal conductance in both control and salinity conditions. Surprisingly, salt stress lowered stomatal conductance but had little effect on photosynthesis, opposite to the leaf age effects. Reduction in photosystem II efficiency explained the age-associated decline in photosynthesis, suggesting that the light-dependent phase of photosynthesis is the first process affected by leaf aging. We also found that the sodium exclusion capacity decreased as leaves matured and was age and variety dependent, indicating the importance of leaf age when sampling for salt tolerance studies. Therefore, we suggest that sampling only young leaves is missing critical information in the evaluation of salt-tolerant traits in grapevines.

J	Chen, M; Zhang, X; Li, M; Cao, Y				Chen, Meng; Zhang, Xu; Li, Ming; Cao, Yang			Species mixing enhances the resistance of<i> Robinia</i><i> pseudoacacia</i> L. to drought events in semi-arid regions: Evidence from China's Loess Plateau	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												As a potential planting strategy, species mixing increases biomass production, improves ecosystem service functions, and mitigates climate change. However, the effect of species mixing on tree growth and drought resilience in semi-arid areas remains unclear. Hence, we established tree-ring chronologies of Robinia pseudoacacia L. in pure Robinia pseudoacacia L. plantation (RP) and mixed plantations with Hippophae rhamnoides L. and Populus simonii Carr. at differ-ent proportions of 8:2 and 5:5 (RH 8:2, RH 5:5, RC 8:2, RC 5:5) in the typical semi-arid region of the Loess Plateau (LP), China. The mean annual growth, climate-growth relationships, and tree resilience (Rs) to drought, including resistance (Rt) and recovery (Rc), were analyzed using dendrochronological methods. The results showed that the growth of R. pseudoacacia L. in mixed plantations was lower when Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) >0, but much higher than that in monoculture under drought stress (PDSI <0 or after drought event). Meanwhile, the relationship between PDSI and tree growth was significantly positive in the pure plantation, but weakened in the mixed plantations, indicat-ing that species mixing alleviated drought stress to some extent. The resilience results showed that, although the Rc was higher in monoculture after drought events, species mixing could enhance Rt and mitigate the growth decline of R. pseudoacacia L. during drought events. Moreover, the Rt varied significantly among mixing species and propor-tions and was also affected by the magnitude and timing of drought. The RC 5:5 and RH 8:2 had higher resistance to moderate and severe drought stress. However, RC 8:2 and RH 5:5 could cope better with mild drought stress. These results indicate that species mixing can alleviate drought stress and improve the drought resistance. Therefore, it is necessary to expand species mixing to maximize plantation functions and minimize the potential impacts of warming and drought in semi-arid regions.

At present, the variations in soil microbial communities mediated by plant rhizosphere metabolism in arid environments are still poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the rhizosphere soil (RS) and bulk soil (BS) associated with five plant species adapted to the climate in the Mu Us Sandy Land and analysed the chemical composition of soil metabolites, microbial community composition and diversity, edaphic factors, and their relationships. Some metabolites with ecological functions (such as fatty acids, monoacylglycerides and diterpenoids) were detected in the RS and BS of the five plants. Correlation analysis results show that fatty acids and diterpenoids were significantly negatively correlated with drought-adapted bacterial (Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi) and fungal taxa (class Glomeromycetes and family Nectriaceae), and the bacterial class Rubrobacteria and two fungal phyla Ascomycota and Glomeromycota were significantly negatively correlated with fatty acids and diterpenoids, respectively. Redundancy analysis (RDA) and Monte Carlo permutation results confirm that fatty acids and diterpenoids played critical roles in the variation in the soil microbial communities. Although soil edaphic factors (such as microbial biomass carbon and basal respiration) played important roles in shaping the microbial community, the results of partial least squares path modelling (PLS-PM) show that plant-mediated rhizosphere metabolism was the primary factor that affected microbial alpha and beta diversities. We conclude that plants under drought stress regulate microbial community structures by releasing certain fatty acids and secondary metabolites (such as diterpenoids). In addition, the bioactive metabolites released from the rhizosphere affect the soil microbial community more significantly and directly than edaphic factors. Overall, our study provides insight into the underground ecological processes mediated by plant rhizosphere metabolism.

A factorial combination of N addition (0, 50 and 100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) defined as N0, N50, and N100) and P addition (0, 40 and 80 kg P2O5 ha(-1) yr(-1) defined as P0, P40, and P80) experiment was conducted in a farming-withdrawn grassland to investigate the Rs and its components (heterotrophic respiration, Rh; autotrophic respiration, Ra) in responses to different nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) addition levels from May 2018 to October 2019 on the semiarid Loess Plateau. Results showed that Rs, Rh and Ra presented single-peak curves both in diurnal and seasonal variations across all N and P addition treatments. The highest Rs, Rh and Ra values during the day occurred at 12:00-14:00 and the highest values during the year appeared in July, which were consistent with soil temperature changes. Rs, Rh and Ra increased significantly under N and/or P addition from May to September. Compared with no fertilization, Rh and Ra significantly increased by 4.2-5.1% and 43.9-46.4%, and by 13.2-15.8% and 23.0-34.2% under N or P addition alone, respectively. N and P combined addition increased Rh and Ra by 25.4-30.7% and 62.0-111.4% than N or P addition alone. Rs and Ra reached the highest values under N100 combined with P80 addition, but Rh reached the highest values under N50 combined with P80 addition treatment. Annual cumulative CO2 emission increased by 24.4%-26.5% under N addition alone, 17.0-27.4% under P addition alone and 42.2-68.7% under N and P combined addition. Compared with no fertilization, root biomass and soil microbial biomass carbon significantly increased by 15.8-122% and 5.2-92.5% after N and P additions, respectively. However, the positive effect of N and P addition on Rh was weaker than that of Ra, which decreased the contribution of Rh to Rs. Our findings point to the need of rational N and P combination to tradeoff biomass production improvement and soil carbon emission when applying fertilization to promote grassland restoration in semiarid Loess Plateau.

J	Shang, HX; Xu, S; Zhang, KD				Shang, Haixin; Xu, Song; Zhang, Kuandi			Improvements to solutions for normal depth in multiple sections of tunnels	FLOW MEASUREMENT AND INSTRUMENTATION												The normal depth is an essential parameter for the design, operation, and maintenance of open channels. The circular, city-gate crossing and egg-shaped sections are often used in non-pressure tunnels in hydraulic engineering, agricultural irrigation, and sewerage works. However, the equations governing the normal depth in various sections are complicated implicit transcendental equations. In order to improvements the solutions for normal depth in multiple sections of tunnels, a function model is first established for the geometric features of various sections using the mathematical transform method and while considering non-dimensional parameters. Then implement the revised PSO algorithms in MATLAB, and establish three right solution's formulas for the normal depths in different non-pressure tunnel sections through optimization. The error analysis results and project cases show that the established formula has broad applicability. The maximum relative errors of the formula for normal depths are less than 0.07%, 0.04%, and 0.07% in circular, city-gate crossing, and egg-shaped sections, respectively, which are more accurate than the existing formulas. The results of this research may be useful in design, operation, and maintenance in tunnel engineering.																			0955-5986	1873-6998				JUN	2020	73								101723	10.1016/j.flowmeasinst.2020.101723	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flowmeasinst.2020.101723													WOS:000540841100003

Field experiments were carried out on winter wheat in a semi-humid but drought-prone region of northwest China during 2020 - 2021 and 2021 - 2022. There were two planting patterns (P): ridge-furrow planting with plastic film mulching on ridges (RF) and conventional flat planting (F), two supplementary irrigation amounts (I): 30 mm supplementary irrigation at both overwintering and returning-green stages (I60) and no supplementary irrigation (I0), and three planting densities (D): 240 x 104 plants ha-1 (LD), 360 x 104 plants ha-1 (MD) and 480 x 104 plants ha-1 (HD). The results showed that significant interactive effects of P x I, P x D, I x D and P x I x D on grain yield and water productivity of grain yield (WPg) were obtained, and the interactive effects of P x I, I x D and P x I x D on partial factor productivity of nitrogen (NPFP) and net income (NI) were significant. Compared with F, RF increased grain yield by 10.4%, WPg by 11.9%, water productivity of biomass yield (WPb) by 6.2%, precipitation and irrigation water use efficiency (PIUE) by 10.4%, irrigation water use efficiency (IUE) by 12.0%, agronomic nitrogen use efficiency (ANUE) by 5.3%, NPFP by 10.6% and NI by 17.1%. Compared with I0, I60 increased grain yield by 13.5%, WPg by 7.8%, ANUE by 5.7%, NPFP by 13.7% and NI by 27.9%. Increasing planting density improved soil water consumption, population nitrogen uptake, effective number of panicles per unit area, WPb, PIUE, ANUE, NUtE and total income. Grain yield, WPg, NPFP and NI reached the maximum values at MD under RF, because the presence of plastic film in RF reduced the number of planting rows and resulted in excessive planting density in the plant row at HD compared to F. In summary, the optimized planting density (360 x104 plants ha-1) combined with ridge-furrow planting and supplementary irrigation is more desirable for balancing grain yield, water productivity, nitrogen use efficiency and economic benefit of winter wheat in the semi-humid and drought-prone region of northwest China.

J	Wang, XP; Shi, JM; Wang, CF; Gao, C; Zhang, F				Wang, Xiaoping; Shi, Jingming; Wang, Chenfeng; Gao, Chao; Zhang, Fei			Remote Sensing Inversion and Mapping of Typical Forest Stand Age in the Loess Plateau	REMOTE SENSING												The accuracy of vegetation indices (VIs) in estimating forest stand age is significantly inadequate due to insufficient consideration of the differences in the physiological functions of forest ecosystems, which limits the accuracy of carbon sink simulation. In this study, remote sensing inversion and mapping of forest stand age were carried out on the Loess Plateau under consideration of the remote sensing mechanism of VIs and the physiological function and canopy structure of the forest using multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF) models. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The canopy reflectance of different forest stands has a significant change pattern, and the older the forest stands, the lower the NIR reflectance. The relationship between forest stands and red edge is the most significant, and r is 0.53, and the relationship between Simple Ratio Index (SR), near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Global Vegetation Index and forest stands is more nonlinear than linear. (2) Principal component analysis (PCA) of canopy spectral information shows that SR, NDVI and red edge (B-5) could explain 98% of all spectral information. SR, NDVI and red edge (B-5) were used to construct a multiple linear regression model and random forest (RF) algorithm model, and RF has high estimation accuracy (R-2 = 0.63). (3) The accuracy of the model was evaluated using reference data, and it was found that the accuracy of the RF model (R-2 = 0.63) was higher than that of the linear regression model (R-2 = 0.61), but both models underestimated the forest stand age when the forest stand age was greater than 50a, which may be caused by the saturation of the reflectance of the old forest canopy. The RF model was used to generate the dataset of forest stand information in the Loess Plateau, and it was found that the forest is dominated by young forests (<20a), accounting for 38.26% of the forest area, and the average age of forests in the Loess Plateau is 56.1a. This study not only improves the method of forest stand age estimation, but also provides data support for vegetation construction in the Loess Plateau.					; Zhang, Fei/AAD-6047-2019	WANG, Xiaoping/0000-0001-6518-673X; Zhang, Fei/0000-0002-1194-8513														2072-4292				DEC	2023	15	23							5581	10.3390/rs15235581	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15235581													WOS:001117687600001

P.; Yasuda, Hiroshi; Gang, Liu			Estimation of surface depression storage capacity from random roughness and slope	WATER SA												Depression storage capacity (DSC) models found in the literature were developed using statistical regression on for relatively large soil surface roughness and slope values resulting in several fitting parameters. In this research, we developed and tested a conceptual model to estimate surface depression storage having small roughness values usually encountered in rainwater harvesting micro-catchments and bare soil in arid regions with only one fitting parameter. Laboratory impermeable surfaces of 30 x 30 cm(2) were constructed with 4 sizes of gravel and mortar resulting in random roughness values ranging from 0.9 to 6.3 mm. A series of laboratory experiments were conducted under 9 slope values using simulated rain. Depression storage for each combination of relative roughness and slope was estimated by the mass balance approach. Analysis of experimental results indicated that the developed linear model between DSC and the square root of the ratio of random roughness (RR) to slope was significant at p < 0.001 and coefficient of determination R- (2) = 0.90. The developed model predicted depression storage of small relief at higher accuracy compared to other models found in the literature. However, the model is based on small-scale laboratory plots and further testing In the field will provide more insight for practical applications.

Seed Quality in China from 2013 to 2018	AGRONOMY-BASEL												In this study, a comparative analysis of seed quality indicators of 1196 hybrid maize seed samples from the main maize-producing areas in China from 2013 to 2018 was carried out. The results showed that the maize seed quality in China had changed obviously in the past six years, and was mainly as follows: The percentage of samples with coated seed in 2015-2018 was higher than 62.8% in 2013 and all exceeded 97%; the sample rate of packaging according to seed number was from 24.5% in 2013 to 58.6% in 2018, and the percentage of samples which met the prescribed quality standards was from 89.2% in 2013 to 98.4% in 2018. Principal component analysis indicated that standard germination energy (SGE), standard germination percentage (SGP), cold test germination percentage (CTGP), accelerated aging test germination percentage (AATGP), and mean field seedling emergence (FSE) were the primary predictors of seed germination and seedling emergence. Meanwhile, combining other statistical methods, regression models of SGE, SGP, CTGP, and AATGP were established to predict the field seedling emergence. Furthermore, seed bulk density and total starch content were correlated with seed vigor, which needs to be further studied. This study offered a theoretical basis and data support to better understand the changes of maize quality in China over the past six years, and provided an important reference to further improve the maize seed quality in the future.

J	Shao, YT; Mu, XM; He, Y; Chen, K				Shao, Yiting; Mu, Xingmin; He, Yi; Chen, Kai			Variations in runoff, sediment load, and their relationship for a major sediment source area of the Jialing River basin, southern China	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Investigation of the variations in runoff, sediment load, and their dynamic relation is conducive to understanding hydrological regime changes and supporting channel regulation and fluvial management. This study is undertaken in the Xihanshui catchment, which is known for its high sediment-laden in the Jialing River of the Yangtze River basin, southern China, to evaluate the change characteristics of runoff, sediment load, and their relationship at multi-temporal scales from 1966 to 2016. The results showed that runoff changed significantly for more months, whereas the significant changes in monthly sediment load occurred from April to September. The contributions of runoff in summer and autumn and sediment load in summer to their annual value changes were greater. Annual runoff and sediment load in the Xihanshui catchment both exhibited significant decreasing trends (p < 0.05) with a significant mutation in 1993 (p < 0.05). The average annual runoff in the change period (1994-2016) decreased by 49.58% and annual sediment load displayed a substantial decline with a reduction of 77.77% in comparison with the reference period (1966-1993) due to climate change and intensive human activity. The power functions were satisfactory to describe annual and extreme monthly runoff-sediment relationships, whereas the monthly runoff-sediment relationship and extreme monthly sediment-runoff relationship were changeable. Spatially, annual runoff-sediment relationship alteration could be partly attributed to sediment load changes in the upstream area and runoff variations in the downstream region. Three quantitative methods revealed that the main driver for significant reductions of annual runoff and sediment load is the human activity dominated by soil and water conservation measures, while climate change only contributed 22.73%-38.99% (mean 32.07%) to the total runoff reduction and 3.39%-35.56% (mean 17.32%) to the total decrease in sediment load.

Allan			Particle size reduction along the digestive tract of fat sand rats (<i>Psammomys obesus</i>) fed four chenopods	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY												It is generally accepted that microbial digestion contributes little to digesta particle size reduction in herbivores, and that faecal particle size reflects mainly chewing efficiency, and may vary with diet. Nevertheless, a decrease in mean particle size (MPS) along the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) has been reported, especially in hindgut fermenters. However, to what degree the very fine particle fraction (non-food origin, especially microbes) affects MPS is unclear. Fat sand rats (Psammomys obesus, diurnal herbivores, n = 23, 175 +/- sd 24 g) consumed one of four chenopods (natural dietary items in the wild) for 30 days. Digestibility was related negatively to dietary fibre content. We determined digesta MPS in the forestomach, glandular stomach, small intestine, caecum, colon and faeces by wet sieving, including (MPSfines) or excluding (MPSnofines) particles < 0.25 mm. The proportions of fines were higher and of MPSfines were correspondingly lower in GIT sections that harbour microbes (forestomach, hindgut), whereas MPSnofines did not differ between forestomach and glandular stomach. However, MPSnofines decreased along the GIT, indicating MPS reduction due to digestive (enzymatic and microbial) processes. The four different diets led to different MPS, but the magnitude of MPS reduction in the GIT was not correlated with dietary fibre fractions or dry matter digestibility. These results indicate that within a species, MPS cannot be used as a proxy for diet quality or digestibility, and raise the hypothesis that MPS reduction along the GIT may be more pronounced in smaller than in larger mammalian terrestrial herbivores, possibly due to the fine initial particles produced by chewing in small species.

Agronomic performance and flowering behavior in response to photoperiod and vernalization in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) Genotypes with contrasting drought tolerance behavior	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												In dry environments, the appropriate matching of reproductive development with water availability is considered very crucial for crop success. In this study, the role of variations in flowering and drought tolerance in selected barley genotypes with contrasting drought tolerance behavior was studied under field and controlled conditions. For this purpose, field trials were conducted for two consecutive seasons at three diverse locations where the studied genotypes were subjected to either rainfed conditions or rainfed plus supplementary irrigation under two different sowing dates. Furthermore, reproductive meristem development was assessed in two selected barley genotypes, Rum (drought tolerant) and Steptoe (drought-sensitive), in response to both vernalization and water stress under two different photoperiod conditions. Variation in the number of days to heading was more pronounced under rainfed conditions than under rainfed plus supplementary irrigated conditions. For agronomic performance, Rum was superior under all tested environments, which assures its general adaptability to dry environments. In addition, Rum was found to be the most stable genotype under dry conditions. Based on sowing and water regime treatments, a signifcant negative correlation was detected between heading date and yield was detected in field grown Rum and Steptoe. Under controlled conditions, the transition to reproductive meristem was faster under vernalized long-day conditions compared to vernalized short-day conditions. The progress of shoot apical meristem development and heading under long-day conditions was significantly faster in Rum compared to Steptoe. A pronounced effect of drought stress was observed on shoot apical meristem development in Steptoe. Under short-day conditions, vernalized Rum plants subjected to drought showed an advanced meristem development stage and a significantly earlier heading compared to non-stressed plants. This early heading in stressed Rum plants under short-day conditions was accompanied by higher gene expression of the Vrn-H1 and Vrn-H3 genes. In conclusion, the integration of vernalization and photoperiod signals in drought-tolerant barley genotypes was associated with early heading and higher productivity in dry environments.

J	Akrami, M; Arzani, A; Majnoun, Z				Akrami, Mahmoud; Arzani, Ahmad; Majnoun, Zahra			LEAF ION CONTENT, YIELD AND FRUIT QUALITY OF FIELD-GROWN MELON UNDER SALINE CONDITIONS	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												Our knowledge of melon (Cucumis melo L.) response to salinity stress is limited under field conditions and then the genotype x environment interaction and heritability of agro-morphological traits are poor understood. A field trial (2014/2015) was carried out to evaluate the performance of 17 melon cultivars, including 16 native and one exotic (Galia), under salinity stress. Leaf ion concentrations, agronomic, morphological and fruit quality traits were evaluated and their heritabilities were estimated. The results showed significant effects of salinity stress and genotype on the studied traits except for days to anthesis and peel thickness. Salinity stress also caused significant reductions in fruit weight and leaf K+ concentration, while increasing leaf Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations and total soluble solids. The most salt-tolerant cultivars ('Sabouni' and 'Shahabadi-1') had higher fruit yield, low leaf Na+ and high leaf K+ concentrations and enhanced K+/Na+ ratio under stress conditions. In general, the heritability estimates were higher under control than under salinity conditions, and the highest heritability was observed for total soluble solids. In addition, fruit weight, number of fruit per plant and leaf Na+ concentration were the strongest predictors of fruit yield, explaining 92% of yield variation under salt stress. These observations suggest that indirect selection based on these traits would be effective in improving fruit production under saline conditions.

Stakeholder-informed land use change modelling to predict the future of a groundwater-dependent prime-wine region under climate change	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Although land use change (LUC) can have detrimental environmental impacts, very few studies have explored the idea that changes in groundwater conditions and water management directly influence LU. This study uses a socio-hydrogeological approach to model future land use change and help to understand the implication for groundwater availability. The Angas Bremer Prescribed Wells Area (Murray-Darling Basin, Australia) was used as a case study because it provides a rare example of complex and transient groundwater management. This study (i) uses groundwater levels and salinities as drivers for LU; (ii) considers future scenarios based on agricultural development of certain crop types rather than conservation or urban development; and, (iii) takes a socio-hydrogeological approach, using stakeholder expertise in future scenarios design and information gathering on its implications for regional groundwater resources. Predicted changes in climate (rainfall and temperature) will lead to increased uncertainties in agricultural production within the region, which is expected to be espe-cially detrimental for the viticulture industry in Angas Bremer. By using the PLUS model and the development potential (growth possibility) of each LU type through the Land Expansion Analysis Strategy module, we have been able to identify optimum potential growth areas for both vegetables and vineyards. A social-hydrogeology approach is an important aspect to LUC modelling linked to groundwater management. The stakeholder engagement resulted in important inputs and the design of LU scenarios that were consequently more relevant.

For the first time, protein contents instead of lipid con-tents of organisms were used in bioaccumulation models to predict the concentrations and reveal the accumulation mechanisms of PFASs in various aquatic organisms, based on the available data. Comparison between the modeled and measured results indicated the models were promising to predict the PFAS concentrations in the fishes at different trophic levels very well, as well as their bioaccumulation factors (BAF) and trophic magnification factors (TMF) of PFASs in fish. Both water and sediment are important exposure sources of PFASs in aquatic organisms. As the two main uptake pathways, the contribution of gill respiratory decreases while that of dietary intake increases with the chain length of PFASs increasing. Fecal excretion and gill respiration are the main pathways for fish to eliminate PFASs, and their relative contributions increase and decrease respectively with chain length. The short-chain (C6- C8) perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are greatly eliminated via gill respiratory quickly, leading to their very low BAFs. As the carbon chain length increases, dietary intake becomes dominant in the uptake, while elimination is mainly through fecal excretion with relatively low rates, especially in the fishes with high protein contents. For the very long chain (C12-C16) PFASs, they are very difficult to excrete with a low total elimination rate constant (ke = 0.463-0.743 d-1), thus leading to their high BAFs and TMFs. The high intake rate but low elimination rate, as well as the high water and sediment concentrations together contribute to the highest accumulated concentration perfluorooctane sulfonic acid in the fish of Taihu Lake.

The best performing bacterial isolates from preliminary screening (in vitro) were able to produce indole acetic acid (IAA) and gibberellic acid (GA(3)) of 0.25-22.63 and 5.9-31.8 mu g ml(-1), respectively, eight best isolates were further tested for their efficacy in promoting crop growth and yield of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) by different application methods namely seed coating, soil application, and seedling root dip method. The factorial data analysis provided evidence that the interaction of bacterial isolates and different inoculation procedures together generated better yield in the greenhouse pot experiment. The findings suggest that the inoculation of Azospirillum strain ASP25 by seedling root dip method produced greater yields. Correlation and regression models hypothesize that all the variables are positively correlated with yield at P < .01 and growth variables like number of fruits per plant (r(2 )= .886), shoot length (r(2 )= .695), and root volume (r(2 )= .554) at P <= .0001 contribute to the yield parameter individually and by multiple regression model all the plant growth variables together increased fruit yield per plant by 89% (r(2 )= .899). These results demonstrate that a high yield is always linked to a healthy vegetative development. However, as technology in agriculture progresses, the proposed method points to the usage and development of computer applications to estimate crop output.

The response of soil microbial communities to vegetation restoration in desertification environments is still poorly understood. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to evaluate the dynamic changes of the soil microbial community during the growth of Pinus sylvestris var. mongolic (P. sylvestris) plantations. We collected soil samples from five P. sylvestris plantations with different stand age. High-throughput sequencing was performed to determine the microbial community structure. The dynamic relationship between soil microbial community and edaphic factors was analyzed using the co-occurrence network, mantel test and partial least squares path modeling. The results showed that the soil microbial alpha diversity and community structure were significantly various among the plantations (P < 0.001). The number of nodes and edges in microbial co-occurrence network gradually decreased and the interrelationships between species became weak with stand age. The Available phosphorus was the most significant factor affecting the structure of bacterial community (R2 = 0.952), while the total phosphorus was the most significant factor affecting the structure of fungal community (R2 = 0.745). However, soil moisture had no significant effect on the microbial community. pH (0.73) and available nitrogen (0.91) had the largest positive total effects on bacterial and fungal community, respectively. Stand age (-0.65) was an indirect factor with the largest negative total effects on the bacterial community. Therefore, we concluded that the soil microbial community was not limited by soil moisture during the natural restoration process of P. sylvestris plantations in the desertification environment and the phosphorus utilization efficiency played a leading role in shaping the soil microbial community.																			0301-4797	1095-8630				JUN 1	2021	287								112306	10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112306	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112306		MAR 2021						33714736					WOS:000639202900002

The success is, however, limited because of crop genetic bottleneck, factors from growing environments and crop agronomic management practices. A study was conducted to i) identify an optimum seeding rate for durum wheat genotypes that can improve grain yield and grain quality and ii) to evaluate the effect of agronomic biofortification on grain protein, gluten contents, Zeleny index, and grain mineral content. Zinc and Iron containing fertilizers were applied foliarily in the form of ZnSO4.7H(2)O and FeSO4.7H O-2. The data presented in this dataset article included yield and yield related traits, phenological and grain quality traits as well as grain Zn and Fe contents. The grain mineral content was measured by using atomic absorption photometer. A machine Min-fra Smart T (R) wheat grain analyzer was used to mea-sure grain protein content, gluten content, and Zeleny in-dex values for each sample. The collected data were an-alyzed using GenStat (14th ed.) statistical software pack-age. The aim of this dataset article is make the data pub-licly available to enable further extended analyses and as a guide for further research works to improve the pro-ductivity of smallholder durum wheat producing farmers.

Twelve maize genotypes were carried out with three replications in a randomized complete block design across eight locations in 2017-2018 using AMMI (additive main effect and multiplicative interaction) and GGE (genotype, genotype x environment) biplot. The analysis of AMMI model indicated that three agronomic traits all showed highly significant differences (P < 0.01) on genotype, environment and genotype by environment interaction. Genotypes G9, G10 and G3 showed higher stability on GY, EW and KW, respectively. Environments El and E2 had better discrimination on the three agronomic traits of the tested genotypes. Genotypes G8 and G9 showed good performance in terms of GY, whereas G2 and G12showed broad adaptability for EW. It was also found that the genotypes with better adaptability in terms of KW were G5 and G12.					chen, zhaoyang/GRS-1470-2022; liu, bb/GXA-2527-2022														1018-4619	1610-2304					2021	30	10					11424	11432																WOS:000704955000046

Here, we examined a chronosequence of grasslands that were subjected to grazing exclusion for 0, 10, 15, 25, and 35 years (y) on the semiarid Chinese Loess Plateau, and we investigated the succession rate and the metabolic functions of microbial communities at different soil layers (0-10, 10-20, 20-40, and 40-60 cm). Microbial succession rates represented by temporary turnover were assessed using the slope of linear regressions, based on log-transformed microbial community similarity over time. Metagenome functional content was predicted from the sequence data using PICRUSt. Most soil physicochemical properties, microbial biomass, enzyme activity, bacterial diversity, and carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism increased as a result of grazing exclusion but decreased as a function of soil depth. Bacterial communities showed a transition from fast-growing copiotrophic taxa (Proteobacteria) to slow-growing oligotrophic taxa (Actinobacteria) with soil depth. Notably, a higher temporary turnover rate of bacterial communities in the topsoil than in the subsoil layer indicated a decreased successional rate of bacterial communities along the soil depth profile. Nitrospirae had the highest succession rate, followed by Gemmatimonadetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, Variance partitioning and redundancy analysis demonstrated that soil physico-chemical properties had a greater effect on bacterial composition and metabolic functions than plant characteristics (aboveground and root biomasses), and that soil C and N levels and bulk density were the most influential factors. Our study indicated a positive effect of long-term grazing exclusion on the activities, diversity, and functions of the microbial community, and revealed a decreasing successional rate of bacterial communities with soil depth.

Alterations in soil pH emerge as a key driver of the impact of global change on soil microbial nitrogen cycling: Evidence from a global meta-analysis	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												AimSoil nitrogen (N) cycling is critical to the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the impact of global change factors (GCFs) on the microbial mediators of N cycling pathways has yet to be synthesized, and it also remains unclear whether the response of the abundance of N-cycling genes can predict changes in their corresponding processes. LocationGlobal. Time period2000-2021. Major taxa studiedArchaea, bacteria. MethodsWe synthesized 8322 paired observations of soil microorganisms related to N cycling from field experiments in which GCFs (climate change and nutrient addition) were manipulated. ResultsWe found that the abundance of soil microbes and most N-cycling genes were resistant to elevated CO2, experimental warming and water addition/reduction; however, N addition and the combination of N addition with other GCFs significantly increased the abundance of ammonia oxidizer bacteria (amoA-AOB). The results indicated that in steady-state (natural) conditions, the main factors driving the global abundance of soil bacteria, archaea and N-cycling genes varied in terms of the contributions of climatic and edaphic factors. However, upon manipulation of GCFs, the induced change in soil pH was the most essential factor associated with changes in the abundance of soil microbes and N-cycling genes. Notably, the changes in ammonia-oxidizing archaea (amoA-AOA) and amoA-AOB genes, in addition to genes involved in denitrification (nirS and nirK), were significantly correlated with the rates of their corresponding processes, but GCF-induced shifts in the potential nitrification rate (PNR) were explained well by changes in the abundance of the amoA-AOB gene under GCFs. Main conclusionsOur study highlights how ongoing GCFs impact the abundance of soil microbes and N-cycling genes, which might have a profound impact on terrestrial N cycling. Our field-based results provide new insights into the drivers of the abundance of soil microbes and N-cycling genes.

Artificial grasslands with high economic benefits and environmental efficiencies are suitable for cultivation in semiarid areas. It is necessary to explore whether artificial grasslands could be used as crop rotation to improve compacted farmland. In this study, five typical artificial grasslands (Miscanthus sinensis, Medicago sativa, Panicum virgatum, Trifolium repens, and Bromus inermis) and bare farmland were selected to compare relevant indicators of soil physical properties (SPP), soil organic carbon (SOC), soil water storage (SWS), and aboveground biomass via field observations. B. inermis and T. repens with high depth-averaged SOC (10.14 and 9.81 g kg(-1), respectively) had significant effects on the improvement of SPP, but such effects were limited by their low biomass yield (2,208.9 and 1,831.3 kg ha(-1), respectively). In contrast, P. virgatum improved SPP and increased SOC while maintaining higher biomass yield (25028.5 kg ha(-1)) and SWS (1,534.79 mm). In conclusion, artificial grasslands with high environmental efficiencies improved soil quality and could be considered as feasible and suitable rotation species to increase land productivity and promote sustainable agricultural management. Furthermore, P. virgatum with higher biomass yield and SWS might be a feasible and suitable choice on the basis of its potential to improve soil quality in semiarid regions.

Plant rhizosphere microorganisms play a vital role in increasing phosphorus bioavailability and promoting the level of plant-absorbable P in agroecosystems. In this study, Talaromyces purpurogenus SW-10 strain with efficient organic phosphate-mineralizing ability was isolated from maize rhizosphere soil. SW-10 showed efficient phytate utilization with corresponding soluble P levels of 525.43 mg/L and produced phytase in the liquid medium. The response surface methodology (RSM) analysis showed that glucose as the carbon source and (NH4)(2)SO4 as the nitrogen source at 28 degrees C and pH 7.0 promoted higher mineralization of insoluble organic phosphate. When cocultivated with different genotypes of maize seedlings, SW-10 significantly increased the shoot's dry weight by 37.93%, root's dry weight by 31.25%, and the plant height by 13.03% for low-P sensitive inbred line 31778, while no significant change was observed in the low-P tolerance inbred line CCM454. In addition, SW-10 strain significantly increased total P-concentration in the shoots (22.4%similar to 32.9%) and roots (3.10%similar to 9.77%) for both inbred lines. In conclusion, the isolated T. purpurogenus SW-10 strain possesses an efficient organic phosphate-mineralizing ability and maize plant growth-promoting effect, especially for the low-P sensitive genotype that could be exploited for enhancing P availability in agriculture.					yang, xiao/JLL-7721-2023; Li, Yao/JJC-2927-2023; Zhou, Yue/JHS-8791-2023; Li, YU/JQV-2716-2023; Chen, Xin/JDN-2017-2023; wang, xiaoxuan/JMP-6531-2023; liu, yang/JMB-9083-2023; Li, Wen/JQI-4757-2023; yuanyuan, Li/JEZ-6497-2023; Wang, Jing/JRW-1512-2023; wang, qiang/IZW-1751-2023; Wang, Xin/JVE-0200-2024; wang, xiaoqiang/JMT-2783-2023; li, Li/JPA-0218-2023; Yang, Fan/JMA-9594-2023; zhang, ying/JQX-1479-2023; LIU, HAO/JBI-9623-2023; zhang, shuai/IVU-7877-2023; Yang, Jie/JDM-6213-2023; Wang, yl/JNR-4963-2023; wang, wenjuan/JGD-0428-2023; Li, Yan/JRW-0176-2023; Lu, Jianhong/IYT-3322-2023; YI, J/JJE-7713-2023; liu, xiao/JLL-2119-2023; zhang, xiao/JCN-8822-2023; yang, yun/IZE-1092-2023; Zhang, Yusi/JNS-2335-2023; liu, jingwen/JQW-9270-2023; Li, Lei/JPE-6543-2023; Yang, Ying/JLL-3724-2023; Liu, Jie/JCP-1070-2023; Zhang, Wei/JKI-3565-2023; Zhang, Yunyi/JHS-3626-2023; zhang, xinyu/JKI-8403-2023; Zhang, Yuan/JUF-7293-2023; zheng, yan/JKJ-3632-2023; LI, WEI/JUE-9796-2023; li, yifan/JHU-9272-2023; zhao, yan/JNT-6961-2023; zhao, lin/JJF-0406-2023; Yang, Xiao/JDN-0082-2023; xuan, li/JNI-7432-2023; Wang, Xuechun/JRX-6509-2023; yang, rui/JHI-3328-2023; wang, zhe/JNE-3510-2023; wang, jun/JPY-3635-2023; li, xiang/JCN-9316-2023; Wang, lili/IXD-9828-2023; Zhang, Lijun/JEZ-7925-2023; Li, Wei/JLL-4365-2023; Wang, Yue/JRY-8962-2023; wang, xi/JNT-5162-2023; Li, Yan/JUU-5189-2023	Yang, Jie/0000-0002-3941-0053; Wang, Yue/0000-0001-8673-6358; Zhang, Peiyu/0009-0002-2323-059X														2071-1050				APR	2023	15	7							5961	10.3390/su15075961	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15075961													WOS:000970257700001

Yet the response of soil microbial communities to plant rhizosphere metabolism and their interaction mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to explore the influence of Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica (P. sylvestris) rhizosphere metabolites on microbial diversity, and clarify the dominant factors driving the variation in the rhizosphere microbial community along chronosequence. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high-throughput sequencing were used to determine the rhizosphere metabolites and microbial community composition, respectively. The results showed that P. sylvestris can release a variety of rhizosphere metabolites (such as fatty acids, monoacylglycerides, and diterpenes) with certain ecological functions, and these metabolites significantly affected the rhizosphere microbial alpha diversity and community composition. Simultaneously, the edaphic factors, such as pH, soil moisture, organic carbon, total phosphorus, NO3--N, NH4+-N, and available phosphorus concentrations, also significantly affected the rhizosphere microbial community. However, partial Mantel test and variation partitioning analysis confirmed the rhizosphere metabolites had a stronger relationship with the variation of rhizosphere bacterial and fungal communities than edaphic factors.

Intraspecific variation of body size in fleas: effects of host sex and flea phenology	PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH												We investigated the effects of host sex and flea phenology (estimated as periods of high versus low abundance) on individual body size in four fleas of small mammals.Amalaraeus penicilligerandCtenophthalmus uncinatusare ectoparasites of the bank voleMyodes glareolus, whereasDoratopsylla dasycnemaandPalaeopsylla soricisare ectoparasites of the common shrewSorex araneus. We found significant effects of host sex and phenology on the body size of all flea species, although there was no general trend in the directions of these effects. LargerA. penicilligerwere found on female hosts, whereas largerP. soriciswere found on male hosts. In the remaining species, larger fleas were collected from male hosts during periods of high abundance (maleC. uncinatusand femaleD. dasycnema) and from female hosts during periods of low abundance (maleC. uncinatus). Regarding phenology, larger fleas were recorded during periods of either high (A. penicilliger,C. uncinatus,D. dasycnema) or low (C. uncinatus,P. soricis) abundance, but this depended on flea and/or host sex. We conclude that the directions of the host sex and phenology effects varied between flea species. Furthermore, the direction of the host sex effect was mediated by the effect of phenology and vice versa.

However, the key mechanism by which RFMS increases yield and efficiency under different hydrothermal conditions remains unclear. Understanding this mechanism and the interaction between different RFMSs and hydrothermal conditions could provide a practical reference for optimizing cultivation. We aimed to investigate the yield increase potential of different planting systems under the same hydrothermal conditions and evaluate the effects of RFMS treatments on drought resistance and yield increase under different hydrothermal conditions. The following planting treatments were carried out in ridge-furrow prepared fields under seven different hydrothermal conditions in a representative rainfed agricultural area for four consecutive years: 1) ridge-furrow mulching system with complete coverage (RC); 2) ridge-furrow mulching system with ridge coverage (RR); and 3) planting without mulching (control treatment; CT). Compared with CT, RFMS improved field hydrothermal conditions and reduced evapotranspiration of crops. In more hydrothermally limited areas (precipitation, 196-320 mm; temperature,< 18 degrees C), the grain yield and water-use efficiency (WUE) with RC significantly increased by 49.95 % and 57.12 % compared with that of CT, respectively. However, RR and RC had no significant difference in grain yield and WUE in areas less hydrothermally limited (precipitation, 320-460 mm; temperature, 18.6 degrees C-23.6 degrees C) but increased by 13.51 % and 22.19 % compared with that of CT. Additionally, RFMS improved economic benefits, especially in hydrothermally limited areas, with RC increasing benefits by 142.64 %-200.84 % compared with that of CT. Therefore, RC can be used as the optimal technique to overcome simultaneous drought and cold weather in rainfed agricultural areas under hydrothermally limited conditions.

Impact of long-term grazing exclusion on soil microbial community composition and nutrient availability	BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS												While grazing exclusion is thought to drive soil nutrient transport and cycling, and reduce soil compaction, its direct impact on microbial community composition remains unclear. In this study, we examined the impact of grazing exclusion on abundance and composition of soil microbial (bacterial, archaeal, and fungal) communities, especially those associated with nutrient cycling. We surveyed soil physicochemical properties and litter mass, at sites undergoing varying durations of grazing exclusion (0-34years) in a semiarid grassland. Using next-generation amplicon sequencing, we further characterized variations in the composition and diversity of soil microbial communities associated with grazing exclusion and soil depths, as well as subsequent changes in physicochemical properties. Most soil physicochemical parameter values significantly increased as the result of long-term grazing exclusion, and these properties were associated with variation in composition and diversity of microbial communities. Notably, the relative abundances of microbial families associated with C cycling (e.g., Chitinophagaceae) increased with an increase in nutrient availability following grazing exclusion. The abundance of the archaeal ammonia-oxidizing Nitrososphaerae increased with decreasing concentration of ammonium among samples. Likewise, fungal communities were also associated with the shifts in nutrient concentrations, although the majority of fungi could not be classified to the species level. Nitrate concentration also played a critical role in shaping bacterial, archaeal, or fungal communities. Moreover, bacterial and archaeal communities had a greater mean Shannon index in 0-10-cm than those in 10-20-cm soil layer. Results of this study provide novel insights regarding how the length of grazing exclusion and soil depth influence nutrient gradients and microbial community composition associated with nutrient cycling.

Degree day-based model predicts pink bollworm phenology across geographical locations of subtropics and semi-arid tropics of India	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												There is a global concern about the effects of climate change driven shifts in species phenology on crop pests. Using geographically and temporally extensive data set of moth trap catches and temperatures across the cotton growing states of India, we predicted the phenology of cotton pink bollworm Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders). Our approach was centered on growing degree days (GDD), a measure of thermal accumulation that provides a mechanistic link between climate change and species' phenology. The phenology change was predicted by calculating absolute error associated with DD and ordinal date, an alternative predictor of phenology, for peak moth abundance. Our results show that GDD outperformed the ordinal dates in predicting peak moth abundance in 6 out of 10 selected locations. Using established thresholds of 13.0/34.0 degrees C, mean DD accumulated between the consecutive moth peaks across different years were estimated at 504.05 +/- 4.84. Seven generations were determined for pink bollworm in a cropping season, the length of which varied between 35 and 73 days in response to temperature. Pink bollworm population reached its peak during third generation which can be the target for management actions. The study provides essential information for developing pink bollworm management strategies under climate change.

In this study, we explored the response relationships between landscape pattern indices and NPP changes in three major vegetation types (forest, grassland, and shrubland) in the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River Basin using a random forest model. The results showed that landscape fragmentation increased, leading to higher landscape heterogeneity and edge effects. Patch shapes became more irregular, and spatial distribution became more dispersed. From 2000 to 2015, both vegetation types and NPP showed significant spatial heterogeneity in the study area. The number of patches (NP), largest patch index (LPI), and percent-like adjacency (PLADJ) metrics were used to determine the core landscape characteristics to assess the NPP changes in forest, shrubland, and grassland, respectively. This study provides a basis for understanding the relationships among landscape patterns, vegetation types, and NPP and serves as a reference for developing NPP predictive models in the Loess Plateau region.																			0304-3800	1872-7026				OCT	2023	484								110457	10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2023.110457	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2023.110457		JUL 2023											WOS:001038131300001

Fundamental to effective water management is an understanding of groundwater recharge mechanisms. Based on a time series of stable isotopes data for precipitation, surface water and groundwater, the groundwater recharge ratios and water transmission times were quantitatively identified for the studied region. The results showed that groundwater discharge to surface water was a common phenomenon during the dry and wet seasons. However, groundwater could also be recharged by precipitation and surface water during specific months when experiencing large precipitation events. Over shorter time scales (<1 year), groundwater was mainly recharged by surface water, while the groundwater recharge ratio from rainfall during the wet season was higher than that from melting snow during the dry season. Over longer time scales (>1 year), precipitation was the primary recharge source of groundwater in small watersheds due to the general flow direction of groundwater to surface water. Groundwater recharge by precipitation mostly occurred through a combination of piston flow and preferential flow, where preferential flow was the primary recharge mechanism for groundwater replenished by precipitation in this region. Surface water could quickly recharge groundwater by lateral flow through fractures in the aquifer and vertical piston flow. These findings could, therefore, be used to provide a reference for the utilization and protection of groundwater resources in the small watersheds of the loess hilly regions of the Loess Plateau.

The PgHsp10 promoter (PgHsp10pro) sequence region has all the cis-motifs required for tissue and abiotic stress inducibility. The complete PgHsp10pro (PgHsp10PC) region and a series of 5' truncations of PgHsp10 (PgHsp10D1 and PgHsp10D2) and an antisense form of PgHsp10pro (PgHsp10AS) were cloned into a plant expression vector (pMDC164) through gateway cloning. All four constructs were separately transformed into tobacco through Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation, and PCR-confirmed transgenic plants progressed to T-1 and T-2 generations. The T-2 transgenic tobacco plants comprising all PgHsp10pro fragments were used for GUS histochemical and qRT-PCR assays in different tissues under control and abiotic stresses. The PgHsp10PC pro expression was spedfic to stem and seedlings under control conditions. Under different abiotic stresses, particularly heat stress, PgHsp10PCpro had relatively higher activity than PgHsp10D1 pro, PgHsp10D2 pro and PgHsp10ASpro. PgHsp10pro from a stress resilient crop like pearl millet responds positively to a range of abiotic stresses, in particular heat, when expressed in heterologous plant systems such as tobacco. Hence, PgHsp10pro appears to be a potential promoter candidate for developing heat and drought stress-tolerant crop plants. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, it is still unclear how vegetation in the upstream area affects gully headcut erosion processes by changing the hydraulics. A series of in situ inflow scouring experiments were conducted on bare land plots and vegetation plots (including the upstream area, headwall, and gully bed) planted with Bothriochloa ischaemum (BI), Agropyron cristatum (AC), and Medicago sativa (MS) with clustered stems and Artemisia gmelinii (AG) with erect stems to investigate the influence of vegetation on the hydrodynamic parameters involved in gully headcut erosion processes. The results showed that, compared with bare land, vegetation increased the Manning roughness coefficient (n) and Darcy-Weisbach friction factor (f) in the upstream area by 0.2-2.5 times and 0.9-9.6 times, respectively, but reduced the runoff velocity in the upstream area and gully brink. However, the jet flow velocity at entry into the plunge pool increased rapidly after passing through the gully head. The influence of vegetation with clustered stems on roughness and runoff velocity was greater than that of vegetation with branched stems. At 3.6 m3/h inflow discharge, vegetation can increase the runoff shear stress of the upstream area. The energy consumption of the gully head, upstream area, and gully bed accounted for 74 to 76 %, 19 to 21 %, and 4 to 7 % of the total energy consumption, respectively. The four vegetation treatments reduced the gully headcut soil loss by 31 to 81 %, among which MS exhibited the highest reduction. The soil loss rate was positively correlated with the jet flow velocity and its kinetic energy, and the correlation was the best (R2 of 0.934 and 0.935, respectively, P < 0.01), presenting a logarithmic trend. These results are helpful to deepen the understanding of the roles of vegetation in regulating runoff hydraulic action during gully headcut erosion.

The aim of this study was to perform sensitivity analyses of the ASCE-Penman-Monteith reference ET equation (ETo(PM)) for different tropical and subtropical climates, where a quantitative understanding of water fluxes to the atmosphere is limited. Sensitivity coefficients were derived on a daily basis for maximum and minimum air temperature, solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit and wind speed at 2m height using data from 44-year of actual measurements for calibration (1970-2014), for nine different climatic zones across Brazil. A multiple regression analysis was performed to estimate the relation between meteorological data and ETo(PM) across climatic zones. Seasonal and annual average estimates were obtained by averaging daily values and spatial patterns of ETo(PM) were obtained by interpolating meteorological data from all sampled locations. Five climate variables were used in the analysis, which revealed diverse effects on ETo(PM) across seasons and climatic zones. In order of importance, ETo(PM) was most sensitive to annual variation in vapor pressure deficit (VPD), wind speed (U-2) and solar radiation (R-s) in all climate types. Our analysis also showed that VPD, calculated from measurements of relative humidity and temperature (T), are essential to accurately predict ETo(PM) across tropical and subtropical climates. Due to the lack of direct meteorological measurements in many Brazilian regions, we recommend the adjustment of climate-driven hydrological fluxes predictions to the most sensitive variables, i.e., VPD, to improve the precision of reference ET losses. Our results will be useful in delineating the influence of different climatic variables in the ASCE Penman-Monteith model and in guiding new climatic modeling efforts in tropical and subtropical regions.

Given that food security is a crucial issue in Ethiopia, the question is whether market-oriented vegetable production will actually help farmers to become more food secure. Using a mixed methods approach, the present research gathered empirical evidence on the determinants of participation in the vegetable business and its food security impacts in the Raya Azebo district. The Heckman two-stage selection model was used to identify factors affecting participation in the vegetable business and its effects on several food security outcomes. A thematic analysis was applied to the qualitative data. The results show that a farmer's participation in the vegetable business increased significantly with adequate household productive resources (e.g., land size and access to irrigation), cooperative memberships and access to extension services. On the other hand, the age of the head of household, the market distance and risk perceptions significantly decreased participation. Additionally, the results indicate participation in the vegetable business results not only in higher food availability and access but also in lower food variety and diet diversity scores. Participation has less of an impact on per capita kilocalorie consumption and child anthropometric measures of food security. The policy implication is that, while Ethiopia is going ahead with inclusive market-driven approaches to food security, alternative mechanisms must be put in place to address the negative impacts and to empower those living in the most vulnerable conditions.

Multi-site generalized dissimilarity modelling reveals drivers of species turnover in ectoparasite assemblages of small mammals across the northern and central Palaearctic	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim We studied compositional turnover in two ectoparasite taxa asking whether (a) the main driver of turnover (environmental factors, host composition, or distance) is the same in both taxa; (b) the turnover of rare and widespread fleas and mites is driven by different factors; and (c) the turnover of either fleas or mites or both respond to the same environmental gradients as the turnover of their hosts. Location Northern and central Palaearctic. Time period 1959-2004. Main taxa studied Fleas, gamasid mites, mammals. Methods We used data on fleas and mites collected from 30 and 20 regions, respectively, and applied a novel metric, zeta diversity, and a novel approach, multi-site generalized dissimilarity modelling (MS-GDM). Results In fleas, variance explained by the models with host turnover as a predictor was higher than that of models with environment and distance or environment only. In mites, similar proportions of variance were explained by models with and without a host-associated predictor. Host turnover strongly affected the compositional turnover of fleas, whereas mite turnover was equally influenced by host turnover and dissimilarity in air temperature. When host turnover was removed from the models, temperature became the most important predictor of turnover, followed by precipitation (for both taxa) and distance (for fleas). The effects of host turnover and environment were stronger for turnover of rare than widespread species. Temperature was the most important predictor of the host turnover independently of whether distance was included in the model. Main conclusions We conclude that the strength and manifestation of the effects of host compositional turnover as compared to environmental dissimilarity differ between ectoparasite taxa. Moreover, the application of MS-GDM allowed us to reveal patterns that were obscured or distorted in earlier studies.

J	Irvine, DJ; Cartwright, I				Irvine, Dylan J.; Cartwright, Ian			CMBEAR: Python-Based Recharge Estimator Using the Chloride Mass Balance Method in Australia	GROUNDWATER												The chloride mass balance (CMB) method is widely used to estimate long-term rates of groundwater recharge. In regions where surface water runoff is negligible, recharge can be estimated using measurements of chloride concentrations of groundwater and precipitation, and an estimate of long-term average rainfall. This paper presents the Chloride Mass Balance Estimator of Australian Recharge (CMBEAR), a Jupyter (Python) Notebook that is set up to rapidly apply the CMB method using gridded maps of chloride deposition rates across the Australian continent. For an Australian context, the chloride deposition rate and rainfall maps have been provided. Thus, CMBEAR requires only a spreadsheet with the groundwater chloride concentration, the latitude and longitude of the sample location, and some simple user inputs. CMBEAR may be easily applied in other regions, providing that a gridded chloride deposition map is available. Recharge estimates from CMBEAR are compared against published applications of the CMB method. CMBEAR is also applied to a large dataset from the Northern Territory and is used to produce a gridded map of recharge for western Victoria. CMBEAR provides a reproducible and straightforward approach to apply the CMB method to estimate groundwater recharge.

Narrow rows and high maize plant population improve water use and grain yield under conservation agriculture	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												The relationship between maize (Zea mays L.) population density and grain yield is influenced by soil and crop management strategies, including Conservation Agriculture (CA). However, little is known about the response of maize grain yield to varying plant population and/or row spacing under CA. A 3-yr study was conducted under CA to evaluate the effects of plant population and row spacing on maize grain yield, plant available soil water, and soil temperature. Plant populations ranging from 40,000 to 80,000 plants ha(-1) were evaluated at three row spacings (0.5, 0.76, and 1.0 m). The response of maize grain yield to plant population was highly variable between seasons: it was not affected by plant population in the season with the highest early season rainfall but increased with increasing plant population in the driest season and in the season with well-distributed, near average rainfall. Higher plant populations resulted in lower soil water levels, presumably due to greater water extraction. Plant population affected soil water availability in the 20- to 80-cm soil layer in Season 2, while plant population affected soil water availability at all soil layers except the 10- to 20- and 60- to 80-cm soil layers in Season 3.

The present study was designed to evaluate the potential of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) model to predict wheat grain yield and to determine the urea fertilizer application rate for maximizing wheat grain yield. The urea fertilizer, %sand, %silt, %clay, elevation, soil nitrogen (N), soil electrical conductivity (EC), soil phosphorus (P) and soil pH were used as input parameters and wheat grain yield was used as output. The ANNs model was trained using 124 data sets collected during growing seasons of 2008-09 to 2010-11 and evaluated using randomly selected 20 data sets of 2010-11 and 48 data sets of 2011-12. The results showed that ANNs model has the potential to predict wheat grain yield under semiarid conditions, as the mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.50% was found for training and 9.48% was observed for testing the model. To determine urea fertilizer application rate for maximizing wheat grain yield, the trained model was run for 14 urea fertilizer levels ranging from 0 to 400 kgurea ha(-1). It was examined that 210 kg-urea ha(-1) produced maximum grain wheat yield (4200 kg ha(-1)) and further increase of urea fertilizer rates resulted in decrease of wheat grain yield. These results also showed that ANNs model is a useful tool to estimate the wheat grain yield response to soil and landscape attributes and to determine the optimum urea fertilizer level for maximizing the wheat grain yield in semi-arid conditions of Faisalabad.

Existing erosion measurement techniques, typically including erosion pins, 3D laser scanners and erosion tracers, have some limitations in practice. A new in situ technique, called the magnetic layer detection (MLD) method, is introduced in this paper. The MLD method determines superficial soil layer thickness (SLT) by detecting the depth of an underground artificial magnetic layer (ML) using a magnetic susceptibility (MS) field probe. It enables a shift from rapid MS measurement to soil erosion or deposition quantification. The results of simulated soil profiles showed the relationship between SLT and volume MS of a target ML exactly followed a universal exponential equation, not sensitive to soil type and ML magnetism level. The theoretical analysis based on the optimally fitted curves showed the accuracy of the MLD method is < +/- 2 mm, and the most effective detection depth ranged from 0 to 80 mm in superficial soil profile. The results of indoor water and wind erosion experiments indicated that the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and root mean square error of eroded SLT between the MLD method and the mass weighing method were 76.2% and 0.9 mm for water erosion, respectively and 91.2% and 1.2 mm for wind erosion, respectively. These results indicated the MLD method could rapidly and precisely determine the SLT induced by water erosion and wind erosion. Considering its rapid measurement, low cost, relatively high accuracy, little disturbance to soil erosion process, and no maintenance in monitoring points, the MLD method has great potential for widespread use in soil erosion monitoring.

Effect of dietary chromium, vitamin E and selenium supplementation on biochemical and physiological parameters of Holstein Friesian cows under heat stress	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES												A study was carried out for a period of 90 days during the summer season with the inclusion of chromium propionate and vitamin E with selenium, in the feed to investigate their effect on 24 uniparous lactating Holstein Friesian cows in an early phase of lactation. Cows were randomly assigned to four supplemental doses of 0 (T0); 500 IU/animal/day of vitamin E and 0.3 mg/kg DM of selenium (T1); 0.5 mg/kg DM of chromium propionate (T2) and 0.5 mg/kg DM of chromium propionate, 500 IU/animal/day of vitamin E and 0.3 mg/kg DM of selenium (T3). The mean THI value in the morning was 75.10 +/- 0.42 and 80.01 +/- 0.64 in the afternoon indicating that the animals were under mild to moderate heat stress. Increase in the DMI was found in the supplemented groups with a significant difference between control and T3 group. Milk yield differed significantly between the control and supplemented groups. The hematological profile did not vary significantly among the groups. Supplementation of chromium along with vitamin E and selenium decreased the cortisol level and glutathione peroxidase activity signigicantly in the T3 group. Chromium supplemented groups (T2 and T3) showed greater increase in mean total protein, albumin concentration and A/G ratio. However, the mean values for thyroid profile, liver enzymes, superoxide dismutase, catalase, globulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, urea, creatinine were comparable among the four groups. Statistical analysis revealed that the rectal temperature, respiratory rate, and pulse rate in supplemented groups were significantly reduced. The findings showed that chromium supplementation plays a significant role in alleviating thermal stress and is further more beneficial when supplemented with proven antioxidants vitamin E and selenium.																			0367-8318					JUL	2022	92	7					858	864		10.56093/ijans.v92i7.109736	http://dx.doi.org/10.56093/ijans.v92i7.109736													WOS:000828132500011
J	Dou, YX; Liao, JJ; An, SS				Dou, Yanxing; Liao, Jiaojiao; An, Shaoshan			Importance of soil labile organic carbon fractions in shaping microbial community after vegetation restoration	CATENA												Studies have been increasingly focusing on soil carbon (C) pools to facilitate the sequestration and stabilisation of soil organic carbon (SOC). However, interactions between different SOC fractions and microbial communities have remained largely unexplored after vegetation restoration on the Loess Plateau. To address this gap, we analysed 16S and ITS rRNA gene sequencing, active SOC (Ca), slow SOC (Cs), passive SOC (Cp) and edaphic factors to decipher the importance of soil C fractions in shaping microbial communities after vegetation restoration. Compared to CK (Control, cropland), the average of SOC contents improved 70.52 % (p < 0.05), and the Ca, Cs and Cp improved 83.18 % (p < 0.05), 128.74 % (p < 0.05) and 18.69 % (p > 0.05). Under different land use types, the relative abundance of four bacterial phyla and two fungal phylum were > 80 % and 75 %, respectively. The Actinobacteria relative abundance in natural grassland and natural shrubland was higher than that in CK. The Shannon index, Chao index and OTUs of soil fungal and bacterial communities under CK were significantly lower than that of other land use types, except for artificial grassland (p < 0.05). The microbial communities transited from oligotrophic to copiotrophic groups according to the results of redundancy analysis (RDA), and the cumulative loads of two axes of RDA in bacterial and fungal communities approached 89.90 % and 88.19 %. The variation partitioning analysis showed that Ca and Cs exhibited large path coefficients in explaining the changes in soil microbial communities. And the microbial communities were mediated through change in labile organic C according to structural equation models, indicating that the structures and compositions of microbial communities were mainly under the control of labile SOC content after vegetation restoration. These results are referentially valuable for comprehending how to apply labile SOC in predicting variations of microbial communities and improving predictive ecosystem models for early-warning indicators of soil degradation.

J	Su, YL; Zhang, JL; Peng, SZ; Ding, YX				Su, Yanli; Zhang, Jielin; Peng, Shouzhang; Ding, Yongxia			Simulating Ecological Functions of Vegetation Using a Dynamic Vegetation Model	FORESTS												The ecological functions of vegetation play a significant role in improving human well-being. However, previous studies on ecological functions have only used semi-empirical models, which do not include physiological mechanisms and therefore do not accurately estimate the ecological functions of vegetation under scenarios of future climate change. To address this problem, a process-based dynamic vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS) was used to simulate the ecological functions of vegetation under different climate change scenarios in the Loess Plateau (LP), a typical ecologically fragile area in China. The simulated ecological functions were the carbon stock function (CS), soil conservation function (SC), and the water conservation function (WC). The results showed that: (1) Compared with 2001-2020, the proportion of area by shrub and grass vegetation that was predicted to transform into forest accounted for more than 1% of the area in the LP under the SSP119 scenario and 3% of the area in the LP under the SSP585 scenario during 2081-2100, respectively. (2) Compared with 2001-2020, the CS would decrease in the central and south-eastern regions, the SC would decrease in the western regions, and the WC would decrease in the Qilian, Wushaoling, Xinglong and Liupan Mountains during 2081-2100. (3) The relationships and the corresponding regions between the ecological functions of the vegetation and the corresponding regions in the LP would change significantly under climate change from 2001-2020 to 2081-2100.These results indicate that a process-based dynamic vegetation model can capture the changes in the carbon and water fluxes under changes in the climate and CO2 concentration. It can also capture the vegetation succession, changes in ecological functions, and the transformation of functional relationships, which provide information that is conducive to the management and restoration of vegetation on the LP. This study supplies a novel perspective for vegetation management and high-quality development in other ecologically fragile regions worldwide.					su, yanli/AAH-8102-2020															1999-4907				SEP	2022	13	9							1464	10.3390/f13091464	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f13091464													WOS:000856421900001

Random migration is a primary determinant of plant community assembly in the neutral model. However, whether its role is affected by N deposition is obscure. Therefore, the effects of eight N application rates (0, 1, 2, 3, 5,10,15, and 20 g N m-2 yr-1) on the estimated migration rate of plant community were examined in a long-term field study in a semiarid steppe. Our results indicated that N addition significantly impacted the estimated migration rate (F = 4.89, P < 0.001) and positively correlated with the N application rate (r2 = 0.32, P < 0.001). By constructing a structural equation model, we observed that the effect of N addition was mainly mediated through soil pH, moisture, and fungi: bacteria ratio. Mantel test revealed that the estimated migration rate was correlated with the plant community composition in moderate-N (10, 15, and 20 g N m-2 yr-1) treatment, but not in control (0 g N m-2 yr-1) and low-N treatment (1, 2, 3 and 5 g N m-2 yr-1) groups. Overall, our findings highlight the key role of N addition on plant community migration. ? 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Song, ZL; Liu, GB; Zhang, C				Song, Zilin; Liu, Guobin; Zhang, Chao			Response of rhizosphere microbial communities to plant succession along a grassland chronosequence in a semiarid area	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												Purpose: Changes in microbial communities during natural succession in semiarid areas have been widely studied but their association with plant and soil properties remains elusive. In the present study, we investigated plant characteristics, rhizosphere soil variables, and microbial communities along a chronosequence of grasslands forming on abandoned farmland on the Chinese Loess Plateau. Materials and methods: Rhizosphere samples were collected from the early-stage dominant plant Artemisia capillaris from farmland abandoned for 5, 10, and 15 years and from the late-stage dominant plant Artemisia sacrorum from farmland abandoned for 10, 15, 20, and 30 years. Microbial community composition, including bacteria and fungi, was determined by high-throughput sequencing. Microbial succession rates represented by temporary turnover were assessed using the slope (w value) of linear regressions, based on log-transformed microbial community similarity over time. Results and discussion: Cover and aboveground biomass of A. capillaris tended to decrease, whereas those of A. sacrorum increased during the succession. Although the rhizosphere bacteria of A. capillaris transitioned from Proteobacteria-dominant to Actinobacteria-dominant, the bacteria of A. sacrorum exhibited the opposite trend. Bacterial and fungal community diversity tended to increase logarithmically with increasing plant aboveground biomass, indicating that an increase in plant biomass could lead to enhanced rhizosphere microbial diversity, but the rate of enhancement decreased gradually. A lower temporary turnover rate of bacterial and fungal communities in the rhizosphere than that in the bulk soil indicated a higher successional rate of the rhizosphere microbial community. Levels of soil nutrients, such as organic carbon, nitrate nitrogen, and ammonium nitrogen, were closely associated with the abundance and diversity of bacterial and fungal communities, indicating their critical role in shaping the rhizosphere microbial community. Conclusions: Our results indicate a close association between plant succession and rhizosphere microbial succession in a semiarid area. Plants affect the microbial communities possibly by changing the nutrient input into the rhizosphere.

J	Sun, HW; Ma, JH; Wang, L				Sun, Haowei; Ma, Jinghan; Wang, Li			Changes in per capita wheat production in China in the context of climate change and population growth	FOOD SECURITY												To address challenges associated with climate change, population growth and decline in international trade linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, determining whether national crop production can meet populations' requirements and contribute to socio-economic resilience is crucial. Three crop models and three global climate models were used in conjunction with predicted population changes. Compared with wheat production in 2000-2010, total production and per capita wheat production were significantly (P < 0.05) increase in 2020-2030, 2030-2040 and 2040-2050, respectively, under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 due to climate change in China. However, when considering population and climate changes, the predicted per capita production values were 125.3 +/- 0.3, 127.1 +/- 2.3 and 128.8 +/- 2.7 kg during the 2020-2030, 2030-2040, 2040-2050 periods under RCP4.5, or 126.2 +/- 0.7, 128.7 +/- 2.5, and 131.0 +/- 4.1 kg, respectively, under RCP8.5. These values do not significantly differ (P > 0.05) from the baseline level (127.9 +/- 1.3 kg). The average per capita production in Loess Plateau and Gansu-Xinjiang subregions declined. In contrast, per capita production in the Huanghuai, Southwestern China, and Middle-Lower Yangtze Valleys subregions increased. The results suggest that climate change will increase total wheat production in China, but population change will partly offset the benefits to the grain market. In addition, domestic grain trade will be influenced by both climate and population changes. Wheat supply capacity will decline in the main supply areas. Further research is required to address effects of the changes on more crops and in more countries to obtain deeper understanding of the implications of climate change and population growth for global food production and assist formulation of robust policies to enhance food security.																			1876-4517	1876-4525				JUN	2023	15	3					597	612		10.1007/s12571-023-01351-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-023-01351-x		MAR 2023						37223754					WOS:000951843100001

Quantifying the effects of plant litter in the topsoil on the soil detachment process by overland flow in typical grasslands of the Loess Plateau, China	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Plant litter can be incorporated into topsoil by a natural process, affecting the soil erosion process. This is a widespread phenomenon in erosion-prone areas. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of litter incorporation on the process of soil detachment on the Loess Plateau, China. Four common plant litters (Bothriochloa ischaemum L. Keng., Artemisia sacrorum Ledeb., Setaria viridis L. Beauv., and Artemisia capillaris Thunb.) were collected, then incorporated into the silt loam soil at five rates (0.1, 0.4, 0.7, 1.0, and 1.3 kg m(-2)) on the basis of our field investigation. Twenty litter-soil treatments and one bare soil control were prepared. After 50 days of natural stabilization, 30 soil samples of each treatment were collected. We used a flume test to scour the soil samples under six flow shear stress conditions (5.66, 8.31, 12.21, 15.55, 19.15, and 22.11 Pa). The results showed that the different incorporated litter masses and morphological characteristics, such as litter tissue density (ranging from 0.52 to 0.68 g cm(-3)), length density (2.34 to 91.00 km m(-3)), surface area density (LSAD; 27.9 to 674.2 m(2) m(-3)), and volume ratio (0.003 to 0.050 m(3) m(-3)), caused varied soil detachment capacities (0.043 to 4.580 kg center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)), rill erodibilities (0.051 to 0.237 s m(-1)), and critical shear stresses (2.02 to 6.83 Pa). The plant litter incorporated within the soil reduced the soil detachment capacities by 38%-59%, lowered the rill erodibilities by 32%-46%, and increased the critical shear stresses by 98%-193% compared with the bare soil control. The soil containing B. ischaemum (L.) Keng. litter was more resistant to erosion. By comparing different parameters, we found that the contact area between the litter and soil was the main factor affecting the soil detachment process. The soil erosion resistance increased with the increasing contact area between the soil and litter. Furthermore, the litter incorporation effect on rill erodibility can be comprehensively reflected by LSAD (R-2 = .93; Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency = 0.79), which could be used to adjust the rill erodibility parameter in physical process-based soil erosion models.

Maize is a widely cultivated crop in the APENC, but the potential impact of climate change on maize, and potential adaptation strategies in response to this, are poorly understood. In this study, we used the Cropping System Model (CSM)-CERES-Maize to evaluate the impacts of climate change on maize yield, as well as the feasibility of 2 adaptation strategies; namely, adjusting the planting date and supplying irrigation. CSM-CERES-Maize was driven by an ensemble of 20 global climate models under 2 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs: RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). CSM-CERES-Maize performed well in simulating phenology, leaf area index (LAI), maize yield, and soil water dynamics. The results showed that irrigated maize yield would change by +3.9, -16.3, and -20.4% under the RCP4.5 scenario and +0.1, -31.2, and -53.1% under the RCP8.5 scenario in the 2030s, 2060s, and 2090s, respectively. Rainfed maize yield during the 2030s, 2060s, and 2090s would change by +21.7, +16.4, and +12.6% under the RCP4.5 scenario and +25.1, +4.8, and -12.3% under the RCP8.5 scenario, respectively. Evaluation of adaptation strategies suggests that delaying planting dates and supplying irrigation at the tasseling and grain filling stages are the best strategies to increase maize yield under climate change. These results will provide comprehensive information for local policymakers to combat the adverse impacts of climate change.

Seasonal variation in expression pattern of genes in irrigated and water stressed transcriptomes of <i>Zea mays Z59</i>	JOURNAL OF PLANT BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY												Drought is the major limiting factor for maize cultivation in India. Though many drought tolerant genotypes have been developed, there is very poor understanding of the tolerance mechanisms in these genotypes. Whole genome transcriptome analysis is an established high throughput genomic method employed for understanding complex traits like drought tolerance. We have employed RNA-seq analysis for understanding the drought tolerance of maize inbred line Z59 grown in kharif (wet season) and rabi (dry season). The physiological parameters recorded during the plant growth show difference in the values for relative water content and proline level but no significant changes were seen in root and shoot length. Leaf sample of irrigated and water stressed plants at reproductive stage were sequenced, transcripts were assembled, and the abundance were calculated. The results showed overall difference in expression level of genes in kharif (wet season) and rabi (dry season). The data was comparatively analyzed for genes differentially expressed between the irrigated and water stressed plants in both seasons. Taking p >= 0.001 and at least fourfold change in expression, a total of 453 and 774 genes were found to be differentially expressed amongst the irrigated and water stressed plants grown in kharif (wet season) and rabi (dry season)seasons respectively. Out of the 453 genes in kharif (wet season) grown plants, 227 genes were found to be up regulated and 226 genes were down regulated and in the 774 differentially expressed genes in rabi (dry season) grown plants, 460 genes were found to be up regulated and 314 genes were down regulated, in the water stressed sample when compared to irrigated. Functional annotation of these genes showed upregulation of MYB DNA binding protein and pathogenesis related protein in irrigated and early drought induced protein, late embryogenesis protein in water stressed kharif (wet season) crops. Metallothionein and aspargine synthetase are upregulated in irrigated and ubiquitin family protein, serine/threonine-protein kinase in water stressed rabi (dry season)crops. Gene ontology analysis co relates with the physiological parameters as most of the differentially expressed genes belong to the functioning of the plant when compared to the structural genes.

However, the roles of H2S in symbiotic nitrogen (N) assimilation and remobilization have not been characterized. Therefore, we examined how H2S influences the soybean (Glycine max)/rhizobia interaction in terms of symbiotic N fixation and mobilization during N deficiency-induced senescence. H2S enhanced biomass accumulation and delayed leaf senescence through effects on nodule numbers, leaf chlorophyll contents, leaf N resorption efficiency, and the N contents in different tissues. Moreover, grain numbers and yield were regulated by H2S and rhizobia, together with N accumulation in the organs, and N use efficiency. The synergistic effects of H2S and rhizobia were also demonstrated by effects on the enzyme activities, protein abundances, and gene expressions associated with N metabolism, and senescence-associated genes (SAGs) expression in soybeans grown under conditions of N deficiency. Taken together, these results show that H2S and rhizobia accelerate N assimilation and remobilization by regulation of the expression of SAGs during N deficiency-induced senescence. Thus, H2S enhances the vegetative and reproductive growth of soybean, presumably through interactions with rhizobia under conditions of N deficiency.

However, little is known regarding the impact of altered precipitation on plant WUE in arid and semi-arid regions. The study examined the effects of altered precipitation [i.e., ambient precipitation (100% of natural precipitation), decreased precipitation (DP, -50%) and increased precipitation (IP, +50%)] on the WUE of grass species (Stipa grandis and Stipa bungeana) and forb species (Artemisia gmelinii) in a temperate grassland. The results found that WUE was significantly affected by growth stages, precipitation and plant species. DP increased the WUE of S. grandis and S. bungeana generally, but IP decreased WUE especially in A. gmelinii. And the grasses had the higher WUE than forbs. For different growth stages, the WUE in the initial growth stage was lower than that in the middle and late growth stages. Soil temperature, available nutrients (i.e., NO3-, NH4+, and AP) and microorganisms under the altered precipitations were the main factors affecting plant WUE. These findings highlighted that the grasses have higher WUE than forbs, which can be given priority to vegetation restoration in arid and semi-arid areas.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014; Hu, Zhenghong/ADS-0573-2022; li, jianping/HGB-6631-2022	li, jianping/0000-0003-3761-9950; Li, Jiwei/0000-0003-3912-4564													1664-462X					MAY 19	2022	13								881282	10.3389/fpls.2022.881282	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.881282								35665164					WOS:000806295000001

In this study, we proposed the synchronization index of water-saving and CO2 mitigation to evaluate the climate cost of saving water by different plastic mulching patterns and explore way to improve the synchronization. The water-saving performance, carbon footprint, and the synchronization index were analyzed for three typical plastic mulching patterns, namely conventional partial plastic mulching, full plastic mulching, and "one film for two years " mulching. The results indicated that all three types of plastic mulching systems were effective in reducing the water footprint of crop production, with full plastic mulching showing the best performance in terms of improving crop yields and water savings. The application of plastic mulching mainly influences the carbon footprint through increasing indirect greenhouse gas emission, accelerating soil organic carbon decline and increasing N2O emission. Area-scale carbon footprint showed a significant positive relationship with the input amounts of plastic film, and the sort order of yield-scale carbon footprint was partial plastic mulching > full plastic mulching > "one film for two years " mulching. Calculated synchronization index was-0.35 kg CO2-eq m(-3),-0.10 kg CO2-eq m(-3), and 0.50 kg CO2-eq m(-3) for partial plastic mulching, full plastic mulching, and "one film for two years " mulching, respectively. Full plastic mulching and partial plastic mulching resulted in an additional 0.35 and 0.10 kg of CO2-eq for saving one cubic meter of water, and only "one film for two years " mulching resulted in simultaneous water savings and greenhouse gas mitigation. This study suggests that water savings achieved using conventional partial plastic mulching have costs in terms of climate change. Faced with the dual pressure of global water shortages and climate change, controlling input amounts of plastic film and prolonging the lifetime of the film are simple and effective way to coordinate water savings and greenhouse gas mitigation. Moreover, the results of this study suggested that water savings and GHG emission mitigation cannot necessarily be achieved simultaneously and that searching for both water-saving performance and its synchronization with GHG mitigation should become a new paradigm for the development of water-saving technologies in the future.					cui, jixiao/HKM-7854-2023; Cui, Jixiao/HTR-3009-2023														0959-6526	1879-1786				JUL 20	2022	359								132011	10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132011		MAY 2022											WOS:000799160000005
J	Shi, QH; Wang, WL; Zhu, BC; Guo, MM				Shi, Qianhua; Wang, Wenlong; Zhu, Baocai; Guo, Mingming			Experimental study of hydraulic characteristics on headcut erosion and erosional response in the tableland and gully regions of China	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Severe long-term gully headcut erosion, which further decreases the area of Yuan, is a serious yet poorly understood issue for local ecological environments and social development. Nevertheless, although the hydraulic characteristics of headcut erosion in the loess tableland and gully region of the Loess Plateau remain unclear, they constitute critical inputs in headcut erosion prediction models. The goal of this study is to evaluate the hydraulic properties of concentrated flow and the headcut erosion process and to identify the influence of flow energy consumption on headcut erosion in the loess tableland and gully region. A series of in situ simulated rainfall and runoff scouring experiments were carried out to achieve this goal under flow discharges of 100, 200, 300 and 400 L min(-1) with a rainfall intensity of 0.8 mm min(-1). The total sediment yield was 1660-3850 kg and increased linearly with increasing flow discharge. The contribution rate of soil loss volume at gully head increased with experiment time and was 2.7 times greater than at the upstream area. The concentrated flow was turbulent and supercritical during the erosion process. The headcut retreat distance, flow velocity, Reynolds number, shear stress, stream power, velocities at the brink and bottom, and flow energy consumption at 100-400 L min(-1) were 5.5-25.5 cm, 0.63-1.48 m s(-1), 1244-8593, 0.65-4.45 Pa, 0.61-4.22 W m(-2), 0.78-2.47 m s(-1), 5.23-5.88 m s(-1), and 3.52-12.63 J s(-1), respectively, all of which increased with increasing flow discharge. A positive power function was found between the sediment yield and flow energy consumption, which can be helpful in establishing soil erosion model based on erosion processes. These findings ultimately improve our understanding of headcut erosion in the tableland and gully regions of the Loess Plateau.

Allan; Kam, Michael			A nocturnally-active predator is mainly a diurnal hunter	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The sit-and-wait hunter, Cerastes vipera, is a presumed nocturnally-active desert snake, although it feeds mainly on the diurnally-active lizard, Acanthodactylus spp. We hypothesized that nocturnal activity of C. vipera is pri-marily to locate an ambush site, and that Acanthodactylus spp. is predated mainly diurnally. We used the pro-portion of free-ranging C. vipera that defaecated per day to estimate daily feeding rate, and prey capture per night to estimate nocturnal feeding rate. In adult snakes (n = 161), defaecation was observed in 20.5% and nocturnal feeding in 3.1% per day. The difference between the two estimates represented the diurnal feeding rate, that is, 85% of the daily feeding was diurnal. All vipers ceased movement near midnight, when approximately 50% were in ambush. They maintained their position until morning and four individuals of each sex were followed during the day. These vipers displayed caudal luring in the presence of Acanthodactylus spp., ended ambush at approximately 10:00 when air temperature reached 40 degrees C, and then moved into a nearby burrow. We concluded that nocturnally-active C. vipera adults are mainly diurnal hunters, but could be classified as cathemeral pred-ators. Diurnal caudal luring and differences in ambush strategy in C. vipera are documented for the first time.																			0140-1963	1095-922X				JUL	2023	214								104998	10.1016/j.jaridenv.2023.104998	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2023.104998		APR 2023											WOS:000990753600001

However, most previous studies quantified the soil pore structure in a shallow layer by using low resolution medical computed tomography (CT), whereas few have quantified the soil pore structure in deep soil layers with high resolution CT. In this study, we quantified the soil pore structure of wind-deposited loess under different vegetation types (wheat, weeds, apple orchard, and Robinia pseudoacacia) at depths from 0 to 4.5 m by industrial CT. The results showed that the soil pore number and porosity tended to decreased with depth, but there were no significance differences below 2 m among all vegetation types. For different depths and vegetation types, the number of pores measuring 0-100 mu m was highest, followed by those measuring. 100-500 mu m, and lowest for those measuring > 1000 mu m. The contribution of pores measuring 100-500 mu m to the total pore volume was highest. The variations in the connectivity and surface area density were also focused mainly within the depth down to 2 m, and the variations were minor below 2 m. There were no significant differences in the bulk density and soil pore characteristics under different vegetation types, except for weeds. The results obtained in this study provide insights into the interactions between vegetation and soil water, as well as the hydrological processes for the wind-deposited loess.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				APR	2021	199								105098	10.1016/j.catena.2020.105098	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.105098													WOS:000608022600015

This study examined how the conversion of cropland to forest affects soil microbial activity and stratification ratios of the rhizosphere soil microbial index (RSMI), as well as to clarify the relationship between the stratification ratios of RSMI and soil microbial activity. Soils beneath two typical vegetation types of shrubland (Caragana korshinskii and Hippophae rhamnoides) and forestland (Robinia pseudoacacia) in the Loess Hilly region of China that had recovered for up to 47 and 56 years, respectively, were evaluated at four soil depths (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, and 30-50 cm). Our findings showed that the conversion of cropland to forest mainly affected soil microbial activity in the surface layer (0-10 cm), in which microbial biomass, enzyme activity (saccharase, urease, and phosphatase), and RSMI increased over time, whereas the microbial metabolic quotient decreased. After the conversion from cropland, recovery time (years) caused an increase in the SRR1 (the RSMI ratio in 0-10 cm versus 10-20 cm layer) of shrubland (by 40.56-108.14%, compared to 0 year) and forestland (by 18.48-79.71%, compared to 0 year). Overall, SRR1 was positively correlated with RSMI in both conversion types. In conclusion, the stratification ratios of the rhizosphere soil microbial index of SRR1 provided good indicators of soil microbial activity and were significantly enhanced by the process of the conversion from cropland to forest.

Root morphology, nutrient, photosynthesis, sucrose cleaving enzymes, the transcription levels of sucrose transporters, and metabolite profiling were evaluated via a two-factor (AM inoculation and Pb stress) pot experiment. AM inoculation alleviated the damage caused by Pb to photosynthesis and increased phosphorus uptake. AM inoculation decreased the shoot sucrose content but increased root sucrose content. The transcription of MtSUT1-1 and MtSUT4-1 in roots was upregulated by AM inoculation, which indicates that AM plant has a higher ability of sucrose transport. Both Pb stress and AM inoculation stimulated the activity of acid invertase and sucrose synthetase in roots. In shoots, minor amino acids such as cysteine were increased by AM inoculation. Sucrose content was negatively related to asparagine content. Therefore, AM inoculation may alleviate Pb toxicity by promoting the transport of sucrose from shoot to root, promoting the cleaving of sucrose in roots, and increasing minor amino acids accumulation.

J	Ben-Asher, J; Volynski, R; Gulko, N				Ben-Asher, Jiftah; Volynski, Roman; Gulko, Natalya			Spherical Interpretation of Infiltration from Trickle Irrigation	AGRONOMY-BASEL												The hypothesis of this paper is that infiltration into drip irrigated soils can be described by simple spherical considerations as well as two dimensional (2D) numerical modeling. The major goal was to test a very simple model based on geometry of a sphere formulas, and compare it with elaborated numerical solutions and field experiments. Detailed analysis of soil-water infiltration under trickle regimes is shown to be pre-requisite in the search for the optimal design of system layout. Optimality and simplicity are sought by modeling a sphere for subsurface trickle/drip (SDI) and hemisphere (DI) pattern of moisture distributions during infiltration. Numerical simulations by MATLAB software were used to describe the distribution of soil water. The data produced by this simulation were successfully compared with analytical models and numerical results of Panoche clay loam. To simulate the four discharge rates (0.5, 1, 2, 3 Lh) under DI and SDI we used the input of Panoche soil properties, i.e., hydraulic conductivity function (K-theta) and soil water retention curve (psi(theta)). The resulting regression equation of numerical analysis (N) vs. spherical interpretation (S) was N = 0.97 x S - 19.1; r(2) = 0.98. This result exposes the novelty of the approach by showing that infiltration from a drip/trickle source can be described by simple spherical radial symmetry in addition to analytical or numerical simulations. An example of a design parameter for 3000 cm3h suggested more emitters per meter laterals for SDI than for DI (100 vs. 77 unites, respectively) due to the shorter distance between SDI emitters that are required in order to maintain wetting continuity. At a discharge of around 500 cm3h of three different soils' SDI, positive pressure was detected near the orifice and it caused discharge reduction. This is a self-compensating property of SDI that regulates individual emitters according to the soil hydraulic properties. In conclusion SDI is associated with larger capital investment compared to DI, but it can be compensated by improving the water use efficiency due to increased productivity while reducing losses of water through evaporation, but this option should be investigated as part of specific research.

Water-based spent drilling mud regulates hydrophysical properties of coarse-textured loessial soil	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Amendment application is one of the effective measures used to remediate structural problems in coarse-textured soils. However, the application of water-based spent drilling mud (WBSM) as a potential amendment and its associated impacts on physical and hydraulic soil properties is not well-studied. This research aimed to investigate the effect of the application of WBSM on basic hydrophysical properties of coarse-textured loessial soil sampled from the Loess Plateau, China. Application of WBSM to repacked loessial soil at four application rates (0, 25.0, 50.0, 75.0 g kg(-1), dry basis), denoted as control (H0), low (HDL), medium (HDM) and high (HDH), respectively, was used to investigate changes in soil bulk density (rho(b)), soil total porosity (integral), saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s), relative gas diffusivity (D-p/D-o), soil-water retention and soil evaporation characteristics. The results showed that the soil rho(b) in HDL and HDM decreased by 4.0% and 5.5%, respectively, as compared to H0 (p < 0.05). Measured K-s changed to 36.7% (HWL), 12.2% (HWM) and 4.4% (HWH) as compared to H0 (5.56 cm d(-1)). The application of WBSM further decreased the percentage of soil pore sizes >30 mu m, but increased the proportion of medium pore sizes (>= 30-50 mu m), micro pore sizes (>= 0.3-5 mu m) and extremely micro pore sizes (<0.3 mu m), which was attributed to the clogging effect of the fine and clay particles contained in WBSM. Decline in D-p/D-o, however, was observed with increasing WBSM, likely due to the increased pore tortuosity in fine-grained soil. The van Genuchten soil-water retention model parameters differed largely across the WBSM application rates, with increased soil available water-holding capacity by 50.9%, 65.9% and 64.1% in HDL, HDM and HWH, respectively, as compared to H0. However, WBSM application also increased soil available water-holding capacity and reduced evaporative water loss, which has useful implications for the management of coarse-textured soils with a distinct water deficit in fragile ecosystems. Widespread use of WBSM to amend coarse-textured soils requires further studies to evaluate the effects of WBSM amendments in field trials and its environmental consequences. Highlights Water-based spent drilling mud (WBSM) altered the texture of loessial soil. WBSM increased soil total porosity and changed pore size distribution. WBSM affected the characteristics of soil water and gas transport. The soil water availability was improved by WBSM application.

EVALUATION OF HEAT TOLERANCE INDEX, SUSCEPTIBILITY INDEX OF CANOPY TEMPERATURE AND LEAF CHLOROPHYLL CONTENT OF WHEAT (<i>TRITICUM AESTIVUM</i> L.)	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Heat negatively affects wheat production in the world. At present, heat tolerance remains one least understood field in wheat genetics and breeding, because there are not enough effective methods for identification of heat stress and tolerance. This study used sixteen cultivars of winter wheat to evaluate a new method with stress intensity (6) and heat tolerance index (HTI), and assess the susceptibility index of canopy temperature (SCT) and leaf chlorophyll content (SLCC) at different days after the anthesis to identify heat tolerance. The result showed HTI had significant positive correlations with yield under heat stress, and significant negative correlations with yield reduction rate, indicating that HTI is a good indicator of both yield potential and stability under heat stress which can be used to identify heat tolerance in later generations. SCT at 28 DAA had significant positive correlation with yield and significant negative correlation with yield reduction rate under heat stress. SLCC at 29 DAA had positive correlation with yield and significant negative correlation with yield reduction rate, and especially kernel weight reduction under heat stress. The two indicators may be used to screen for heat tolerant germplasm in early generations, or to identify a large number of wheat cultivars concurrently.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2019	17	4					7357	7369		10.15666/aeer/1704_73577369	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1704_73577369													WOS:000478066700009

However, there is a knowledge gap about how fragmented native forest remnants might contribute to AMF conservation, what is the AMF spore density and root colonization, and to what extent climate change, particularly warming, might impact AMF. The aim of the study was to quantify the AMF spore density and root colonization along altitudinal gradients in three agro-ecological zones of nine church forests in northern Ethiopia. Data were collected from 45 plots. All the surveyed church forest species were colonized by AMF. However, we found a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in root colonization and AMF abundance in forests at high elevation. The topsoil had significantly (p < 0.05) higher root colonization and AMF abundance than subsurface soil. We found strong negative correlations between altitude and both spore density and root colonization and soil fertility. While we cannot separate whether spore density was temperature or soil limited, we can demonstrate the importance of conserving certain tree species, particularly Ficus species, which harbor high spore densities, in both lowland and midland church forests. In the highland, no Ficus species were found. However, Hagenia abyssinica, another Rosales, had the highest spore density in the highland ecoregion.					birhane, emiru/JBJ-0779-2023; Aynekulu, Ermias/M-1825-2017	birhane, emiru/0000-0002-8644-5961; Aynekulu, Ermias/0000-0002-1955-6995; Hailemariam, Mengsteab/0000-0003-1448-7895													0095-3628	1432-184X				JUL	2021	82	1			SI		233	242		10.1007/s00248-021-01744-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-021-01744-5		APR 2021						33851256					WOS:000639706400001

Allan			Resting and field metabolic rates of Awassi sheep and <i>Baladi</i> goats raised by Negev bedouin	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE												Sheep are grazers and goats are intermediate feeders. By employing O-2 consumption and heart rate measurements, resting metabolic rate (RMR) and field metabolic rate (FMR) were determined in four male fat-tailed Awassi sheep (44.0 +/- 3.94) and four male Baladi goats (35.5 +/- 5.42 kg) that were co-grazing natural pasture in the Negev Desert. There were 67.7 +/- 3.75 g DM/m(2) of herbaceous vegetation biomass, which was rapidly becoming senescent and more fibrous. We hypothesized that FMR of these desert-adapted ruminants would be relatively low when compared to other sheep and goat breeds, as animals in arid areas tend to have low metabolic rates. Both sheep (n = 6) and goats (n = 6) foraged 71% of the allotted 11 h free-pasture period; however, sheep grazed more than goats (P < 0.001); whereas goats browsed more than sheep (P < 0.001). RMR was higher (P = 0.007) in sheep than in goats (529 +/- 23.5 v. 474 +/- 25.4 kJ/kg(0.75) BW/d), but FMR did not differ between species (618 +/- 55.7 v. 613 +/- 115.2 kJ/kg(0.75) BW/d). In addition, the cost of activities, as a proportion of FMR, did not differ between sheep and goats; FMR increased by 89 kJ/kg(0.75) BW/d or 17% in sheep and by 138 kJ/kg(0.75) BW/d or 29% in goats. In comparing FMRs of sheep and goats in this study with these species in other studies, differences were inconsistent and, therefore, our hypothesis was not supported.

J	Shi, QH; Wang, WL; Feng, LQ				Shi, Qianhua; Wang, Wenlong; Feng, Lanqian			Response of the Headcut Erosion Process to Flow Energy Variation in the Loess Gully Region of China	WATER												In the headcut erosion process, flow energy is transformed and consumed when runoff is used to transport sediment. Therefore, flow energy variations are critical in the study of headcut erosion. The aim of this study was to illustrate the effects of the upslope inflow discharge and slope gradient on flow energy and the response of the sediment yield of headcut erosion to flow energy variations in China's Loess Plateau. This study examined the headcut erosion using slope gradients ranging from 1 degrees to 7 degrees and designed and upslope inflow discharges of 3.6, 4.8, 6.0 and 7.2 m(3).h(-1). The rainfall intensity was set as invariable 0.8 mm.min(-1). The results showed that the kinetic energy at the downstream gully bed was 0.03 similar to 0.16 J.s(-1) lower than that in the upstream catchment area because of the concentrated flow drop at the gully head. The potential energy at the summit and bottom of the plot were both affected by upstream inflow discharge and slope gradient. The flow energy consumption values of the gully head increased by approximately 1.26 times as the inflow discharge increased by 1.2 m(3).h(-1). Greater energy consumption occurred at the gully head than in the upstream catchment area and downstream gully bed, and the gully head contribution to the flow energy consumption was 44.30 similar to 64.29%, which showed an increasing trend as the upslope inflow discharge increased and slope gradient decreased. The influence of the slope gradient on the sediment yield was stronger than that of the upslope inflow discharge, and a nonlinear regression equation was established to calculate the sediment yield. The flow energy consumption showed a significant correlation with the sediment yield (p < 0.01). Our results could enhance the understanding of the flow energy variations and headcut evolution process during headcut erosion and can also be helpful in the design of gully erosion prevention measures.

Our objective was to investigate the sources, drivers, spatiotemporal patterns of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) transport in the streamwater and groundwater in a dry and a wet season in seven large rivers located in the Loess Plateau of China (640,000 km(2), 100 million population), which is a region with marked influence of human activities on streamflow and groundwater. We collected 510 streamwater and groundwater samples and found that NO3-N was significantly lower in the dry season (< 5.0 mg L-1) than the wet season (> 5.0 mg L-1). In the wet season, NO3-N was lower in the streamwater than groundwater; however, the spatial variation in the NO3-N was greater in streamwater, with higher concentrations in two rivers (Wei and Fen). The source characterization using stable isotopes of NO3 from the Wei River showed that chemical N fertilizers and soil organic N contributed similar to 75% of NO3 to streamwater and that soil organic N was the greatest contributor of NO3 to groundwater (similar to 60%) than streamwater (< 40%). The spatial pattern of NO3-N was dominated by fertilizer application and varied seasonally with rainfall-runoff and streamflow-groundwater connectivity. Our results showed the complicated patterns and sources of NO3 pollution in streamwater and groundwater and highlight that more emphasis should be placed to prevent and restore the degraded water quality in the dry regions.

However, BD data are lacking due to the difficulty of measuring it directly. Pedotransfer function (PTF) may provide an alternative method for estimating BD indirectly based on easily measured soil properties. The Loess Plateau in China (620,000km(2)) has deep loess deposits (50-200m), which makes it difficult to obtain BD values for the deep soil layer, and thus, a PTF is needed for estimating BD.Materials and methodsIn this study, multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods were used to develop BD PTFs for the deep layer of the Loess Plateau based on the soil organic carbon, texture, and depth. In total, 534 undisturbed soil cores were obtained by soil core drilling from five typical sites, ranging from the top of the soil profile to the bedrock.Results and discussionThe BD values all exhibited low variation (CV <10%). Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis showed that BD had significant correlations with the sand, silt, clay, soil organic carbon (SOC), and depth (P<0.01). The performance of MLR was similar to that of the ANN method. The soil depth and clay were also important input variables for the BD PTF. The PTF developed in this study performed better than existing BD PTFs.ConclusionsIn this study, we developed the first BD PTF for the deep layer (50-200m) of the Loess Plateau.																			1439-0108	1614-7480				JAN	2019	19	1					366	372		10.1007/s11368-018-2040-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-018-2040-1													WOS:000456207800034

Understanding how multiple environmental factors interactively influence plant establishment is critical to restoration ecology and in this case to broadscale restoration efforts in western U.S. drylands dominated by big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata). We planted sagebrush seedlings across a range of soil textures and depths in the southern portion of the species' range, on the Colorado Plateau, USA. We evaluated survival of repeated plantings of caged and uncaged seedlings over 2 years across 20 plots in wet versus average precipitation years at one site, and examined broader patterns of sagebrush seedling survival during an average precipitation year in 56 plots across four sites. First-year survival was >9x higher under wet than average precipitation. Under favorable (wet) conditions, early sagebrush seedling survival was highest on coarser soils, especially those that also had a shallower restrictive layer (e.g. 50-100 cm). Under average precipitation, soil texture and depth effects on survival of newly planted seedlings were much weaker, but older (>1 year) seedlings benefitted from growing on coarser-textured soils. It may be possible to increase survival by sheltering seedlings with small mesh cages, which likely improve moisture availability. Our results provide new insights into environmental factors that limit woody seedling survival in drylands and illustrate that planting in wet years and incorporating detailed soil setting information could increase survival of sagebrush seedlings in restoration projects.

The recent researches on soil erosion of spoil heaps are based on one or several soil types, which can only represent the soil texture category within the limited area, but cannot be used in other larger scale areas. Soil texture and gravel are the main factors affecting infiltration and erosion processes of spoil heaps. Materials and methods The runoff plot dimensions were 5.0 m x 1.0 m x 0.5 m (length x width x depth). A series of rainfall experiments with a constant rainfall intensity of 1.0 mm min(-1)and a slope gradient of 25 degrees were conducted to investigate the effects of soil texture (sandy, loam, and clay) and gravel mass content (GC, 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%) on the infiltration and erosion processes. The gravels are divided into 3 classes according to particle size 2-14 mm (small), 14-25 mm (medium), 25-50 mm (large), and the mass ratios were 30%, 50%, and 20%. The duration of each rainfall event was 45 min after runoff out of the plot. Results and discussion Results showed that there was a critical GC (10%) improving or controlling infiltration and soil loss. Infiltration rate of sandy spoil heap (SSH) decreased within 45 min, but it decreased first and then stabilized for loam spoil heap (LSH) and clay spoil heap (CSH). Soil loss rate (SLR) of SSH stabilized first and then increased, while it decreased and then stabilized for LSH and CSH.SLRat early stage (0-18 min) was 0.08-0.23 times than it was at later stage (18-45 min) for SSH, but it was 2.06-5.06 times and 1.46-1.95 times for LSH and CSH, respectively. The soil texture had a more significant effect onSLR(P < 0.05) than GC did. The effects of gravel onSLRswere dependent on soil texture. Conclusions The greater the GC was, the lower theSLRwas for the spoil heaps. Special attention should be paid to the later stage during rainfall events for SSHs and the early stage for LSHs and CSHs when considering erosion protection measures.

Reproductive performance in generalist haematophagous ectoparasites: maternal environment, rearing conditions or both?	PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH												We tested whether and how the maternal environment (i.e. host species exploited by a mother), rearing conditions (i.e. host species exploited by her offspring) or both (i.e. matches and mismatches in host species exploited by a mother and her offspring) affect reproductive performance in the offspring. We experimentally manipulated maternal and rearing environments in two generalist fleas (Xenopsylla conformis and Xenopsylla ramesis) implementing a factorial cross-rearing design. Mothers exploited either the principal host (PH) or auxiliary hosts that were either closely (CAH) or distantly related (DAH) to the PH. After six generations of infesting a given host species, we cross-reared fleas within and between host species. These fleas reproduced and we measured their reproductive performance both quantitatively (i.e. egg number) and qualitatively (i.e. egg size, development time, body size of the next generation). We found that identity of the host a flea was reared on (=actual host) had the strongest effect on its performance. Individuals reared on the PH performed considerably better than those reared on either auxiliary host. Moreover, fleas reared on a CAH performed better than those reared on a DAH. Actual host identity also had a stronger effect on reproductive performance in X. ramesis than in X. conformis. Nevertheless, there was no difference in performance between match and mismatch maternal and actual host identities. We conclude that rearing environment has the strongest effect on fitness in generalist parasites. Moreover, phylogenetic distance between an auxiliary host and the PH determines the level of suitability of the former.

Riverine spawning, long distance larval drift, and floodplain recruitment of a pelagophilic fish: A case study of golden perch (<i>Macquaria ambigua</i>) in the arid Darling River, Australia	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												Pelagic spawning riverine fish (pelagophils) spawn in free-flowing river habitats with downstream drift of eggs and larvae but the spatial scale is often unknown, and this constitutes a major ecological knowledge gap. In the arid Darling River in south-eastern Australia, the present objectives were: (i) to determine the potential downstream dispersal distance of young golden perch (Macquaria ambigua); and (ii) to evaluate whether provision of environmental water enhanced dispersal of young fish from Menindee Lakes to the lower Darling River (LDR) while also cueing further spawning in downstream lotic reaches. Golden perch spawned in unregulated lotic tributaries on a flood pulse and larvae drifted or dispersed >1,600 km downstream and entered large ephemeral productive floodplain lake nursery habitats as fully scaled fingerlings. Planned releases of environmental water cued golden perch spawning in the LDR and enabled juvenile fish to disperse downstream from the Menindee Lakes nursery into receiving populations in the LDR, Great Darling Anabranch, and southern Murray River, with some fish potentially completing an active migration of >2,100 km by age 1 year. The Darling River case study highlights the need for a system-scale approach to the conservation management of pelagophilic fish, along with multi-year perennial flow strategies to improve ecosystem integrity in large rivers globally.																			1052-7613	1099-0755				APR	2020	30	4					675	690		10.1002/aqc.3311	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.3311		MAR 2020											WOS:000517519600001

Visha			Evaluating the impact of projected climate on rice-wheat-groundnut cropping sequence in lower Gangetic plains of India: a study using multiple GCMs, DSSAT model, and long-term sequence analysis	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Cropping intensification is a solution to ensure global food security amid the threats of climate change and variability. Crop models are used extensively to evaluate the performance of single crop for a particular year under future climate. However, very few literatures are available on the application of crop models to evaluate intensive cropping systems. The study attempts to address this issue by evaluating the impact of projected climate derived from 29 GCMs during four future scenarios (mid and end-century under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) on the performance of rice-wheat-groundnut cropping sequence in Mohanpur, India, using the sequence analysis module of DSSAT. A marked reduction in crop duration was simulated for rice (4 to 17 days) and wheat (1 to 16 days) during all four future scenarios. On the contrary, the duration of groundnut increased by 1-4 days. Under elevated CO2 concentration, an increase in biomass was simulated for all three crops. During future periods under elevated CO2, the yield of rice tends to increase under all the future scenarios whereas wheat and groundnut could decrease the magnitude of yield reduction due to an increase in temperature. Rice was benefited due to the carry-over effect of residue from preceding groundnut and, hence, could sustain the yield on the long-term. The uncertainty in simulation due to the selection of GCMs was also quantified. The study provided a better understanding on how a cropping sequence responds to projected climate rather than a single crop in a sequence, which can be used to develop better adaptation strategies.

In a 35-year long-term positioning experiment, the effects of different fertilization treatments on the spectral characteristics of winter wheat canopy in different growth stages of Loess Plateau were studied. The results showed that under single fertilization conditions, compared with no fertilization (CK), from the jointing stage to the heading stage of the winter wheat, the CR500 , CR670 and CR550 values of single P application were higher, while the spectral reflectance of single N and M application was significantly lower. The CR500 values of single P, N and M application in jointing stage were 1. 2 times, 74. 9% and 70. 5% of CK; CR670 values were 1. 2 times, 66. 8% and 62. 6% of CK ; CR550 values were 1. 2 times, 76. 2% and 76. 9% of CK, respectively. The peaks and valleys of the reflex characteristics of winter wheat were significantly enhanced at heading stage than those at jointing stage, at heading stage, the CR500 values of P, N and M application were 1. 2 times, 81. 0% and 53. 5% of CK; the CR670 values were 1. 3 times, 76. 8% and 40. 6% of CK; CR550 values were 1. 2 times, 78. 5% and 63. 4% of CK, respectively. At the filling stage, the peaks and valleys of the reflex characteristics of each treatment were obviously weakened; to the maturity stage, the difference between the peaks and valleys of the winter wheat spectrum under different fertilization treatments was no longer obvious. The spectral characteristics of the red band position absorption valley under single fertilization conditions after enveloping line removal showed that, except for the maturity period, the red band absorption valley area (A) , the red band absorption valley left area (AL) and the absorption peak symmetry CS) of winter wheat with single P application were higher than CK, both with N and Mapplication were lower than CK. Under the combined fertilization conditions, the NMP, NP and NM of all nitrogen application combinations showed similar patterns, and the red, blue absorption depth and green reflection peak and the near-infrared spectral reflectance in the visible light range were significantly lower than CK; the spectral reflectance eigenvalue of the PM combined treatment was slightly lower than CK. Compared with CK, the characteristic value of spectral reflectance of PM combined treatment was slightly lower from the jointing stage to the heading stage; the difference between the spectral reflectance values of NM, NPM and NP treatment was small but significantly lower than CK. The CR500 values of NM, NPM and NP treatment were 25. 85% , 27. 99% and 26. 07% of CK; CR(670 )values were 12. 56% , 13. 27% and 13. 98% of CK ; CR550 values were 33. 39% , 35. 38% and 37. 04% of CK, respectively. The CR500, CR670 and CR(550 )values of PM treatment were 67. 52% , 55. 69% and 79. 40% of CK, respectively. At grain filling stage, the peaks and valleys of each treatment were significantly weaker than those at heading stage. At maturity stage, the spectral reflectance absorption characteristics of different fertilization treatments were not significantly different, but they were significantly lower than CK. The spectral characteristics of red band absorption valley under combined fertilization conditions after enveloping line removal showed that the area of red band absorption valley (A) of the winter wheat was the largest in CK, followed by PM treatment and NM treatment.																			1000-0593					FEB	2020	40	2					535	542		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2020)02-0535-08	http://dx.doi.org/10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2020)02-0535-08													WOS:000528834600035

In order to study carbon released by soil respiration (SR) after rainfall pulses in natural grassland on the Loess Plateau, a rainfall simulation experiment was conducted in a grassland community co-dominated by a C-4 herbaceous grass [Botluiochloa ischaemum (L) Keng] and a C-3 leguminous subshrub [Lespedem davurica (Laxm.) Schindl] in the loess hilly-gully region. Soil respiration rate (R-s), soil temperature (T-s), and soil volumetric water content (S-v) were measured 1 day before and 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 days after four rainfall treatments (ambient rainfall plus a 5 mm, 10 mm, 20 mm, and 30 mm rainfall pulse) and one control treatment (only ambient rainfall) in June and August 2013. Results showed that R-s and S-v largely increased one day after simulated rainfall > 5 mm. In June, the peak R-s under 10, 20, and 30 mm rainfall was 0.80-1.03 mu mol C m(-2) s(-1) in B. ischaemum, with a 25-62% increase compared with the control treatment, and 0.74-1.0 mu mol C m(-2) s(-1) (+51-104%) in L. davurica. In August, the peak R-s was 1.23-1.73 mu mol C m(-2) s(-1) (+23-73%) and 1.52-1.70 mu mol C m(-2) s(-1) (+81-102%) in B. ischaemum and L davurica, respectively. The magnitude and duration of the increase in SR were positively related to the rainfall size, and a more considerable increase was observed in August. There was a threshold rainfall (i.e., 5-10 mm) for triggering SR increases in both months. And different responses were found between the two species, there was more substantial SR increases in L davurica in comparison to B. ischaemum. After rainfall pulses, soil moisture and soil temperature co-regulated SR. During the relatively dry season (i.e., June), SR was negatively correlated with soil temperature and the temperature sensitivity Q(10) value of SR was small (0.5-0.6), while it changed to positively in August and the Q(10) was largely increased (3.2-4.3). Conversely, soil moisture was positively related to SR in both months and explained a large portion of the variation in SR (32-43% and 42-52% in B. ischaemum and L. davurica, respectively). These findings indicated that soil moisture was the major environmental factor in controlling SR in this grassland. Overall, our study suggests that SR response following rainfall pulses is species-specific within the grassland community and tends to be controlled by soil moisture, and these should be considered in the regional carbon budget assessment in the background of vegetation rehabilitation and rainfall pattern changes.

COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS												Water and nutrition are the crucial inputs in the production of high value crops under protected condition, especially the quantity, quality, and timing schedule. A greenhouse experiment on capsicum was taken up for two season during 2020-21 with factorial concept and RCBD design. The experiment was conducted with three levels of automated sensor-based irrigation technology (I-1: 75% Available soil moisture (ASM), (I-2: 50% ASM and I-3: 25% ASM) and 4 levels of fertigation (F-1: 75% RDF, F-2: 100% Recommended Dose of Fertilizers (RDF), F-3: 125% RDF and F-4: 150% RDF) with 100% RDF and surface irrigation as control. The results revealed that combination of sensor-based irrigation schedule at 75% ASM with 125% RDF performed well with higher fruit yield (60089 kg ha(-1)) and was 217.9% higher than the control. Automated scheduling of irrigation at 75% ASM with 150% RDF recorded higher total nutrient uptake, namely, nitrogen (245.30 kg ha(-1)), phosphorus (105.84 kg ha(-1)), and potassium (235.33 kg ha(-1)) than control. It also enhanced economics, namely, net return (US$ 19263 ha(-1)) and B:C ratio (2.07) and resources use efficiency, namely, nutrient use efficiency (79.5 kg kg(-1)) and water use efficiency (16.75 kg m(-3)). Correlation and regression models hypothesize that all the variables are positively correlated with yield at p < .05 and growth variables like nutrient uptake contribute to the fruit yield individually and together increased fruit yield by 97.3% (r(2) = 0.973). These results demonstrate that a higher yield is linked to higher nutrient uptake.

The present study aims to identify the potential function of ATX supplementation in preventing steatohepatitis and hepatic oxidative stress in diet-induced obese mice. Methods and ResultsIn this study, ATX as dose of 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75% have orally administered to mice along with a high-fat diet (HFD) to investigate the role of ATX in regulating liver lipid metabolism and gut microbiota. The study showed that ATX dose-dependently reduces body weight, lipid droplet formation, hepatic triglycerides and ameliorated hepatic steatosis and oxidative stress. 0.75% ATX altered the levels of 34 lipid metabolites related to hepatic cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism which might be associated with downregulation of lipogenesis-related genes and upregulation of bile acid biosynthesis-related genes. The result also revealed that ATX alleviates HFD-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis by significantly inhibiting the growth of obesity-related Parabacteroides and Desulfovibrio while promoting the growth of Allobaculum and Akkermansia. ConclusionThe study results suggested that dietary ATX may prevent the development of hepatic steatosis and oxidative stress with the risk of metabolic disease by gut-liver axis modulating properties.

CURRENT SCIENCE												Trees are referred to as the lungs of the earth for their oxygen releasing potential, via photosynthesis. Air quality in urban areas has deteriorated and it is impacting the well-being of human life. The oxygen spa or artificial oxygen environment is portrayed as an alternative to air pollution. Against this backdrop, there are voices supporting to increase the tree cover in urban areas, thereby increasing oxygen availability. Increasing tree numbers to remove air pollutants is a logical argument, but improving the air quality by increasing the oxygen concentration by growing more trees needs introspection. Thus the question - How much oxygen is produced by different tree species and how to quantify it? According to atmospheric researchers the oxygen concentration of the atmosphere has not changed for quite a long time. Also, oxygen production from the terrestrial ecosystems is less compared to the marine and aquatic ecosystems. Moreover, there are numerous benefits from urban trees or urban greenspaces, so do we really need to worry about oxygen production or release from urban trees?

However, how microbial communities in the deep soil profile, especially the complexity and stability of their interactions, respond to vegetation restoration remains unclear. Here, we explored the soil properties and bacterial community diversity, structure, and network interactions and attempted to identify the keystone taxa along the 0-500 cm soil profile under different land use types (cropland, restored woodland, restored grassland). The results showed soil bacterial alpha diversity, indicated by phylotype richness and Shannon diversity index, was higher in deeper soil layers under restored lands (woodland and grassland) compared to long-term cultivated cropland. The dominant phyla of bacterial communities included Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, and GAL15. Using the molecular ecological network approach, we confirmed bacterial ecological networks were more complex in restored woodland and grassland, compared to cropland, indicating the bacterial species have greater nichesharing and more interactions over the whole 0-500 cm profile under restored ecosystems. Moreover, relatively large and intricate bacterial interactions persisted in the soil deep layer (380-400 cm). Soil available phosphorus (P), organic carbon, and total P contents, fine root length density, and soil moisture conditions strongly affected microbial communities after vegetation restoration. In general, our findings have implications for understanding the potential of restored ecosystems to withstand disturbances under global climate change scenarios.

J	Liu, Q; Wu, CX; Gao, LQ; Ying, L				Liu, Qing; Wu, Chunxiao; Gao, Liqiang; Ying, Liu			Coordination between non-structure carbohydrates and hydraulic function under different drought duration, intensity, and post-drought recovery	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												The maintenance of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) and hydraulic function during drought and post drought recovery is crucial for tree survival, but previous studies lack systematic investigation of their relationship under different drought conditions. We exposed seedlings to varying degrees of drought intensity for three years, followed by short-term, high-intensity drought and re-irrigation, to explore the coordination between NSCs and hydraulic function. We found that long-duration drought reduced native embolism in all organs, and NSCs were consumed in trunks and branches in response to drought. In contrast, total soluble sugar and starch concentrations in roots under severe drought stress increased by 33.90 % and 24.97 %, respectively, in order to survive and adapt to the drought environment. When short-term and high-intensity drought caused hydraulic dysfunction, plants accumulated soluble sugars, including glucose, sucrose, and maltose, mainly driven by starch depletion. Meanwhile, drought-adapted plants had higher embolism resistance at the cost of consuming NSCs. After re-irrigation, drought-adapted plants maintain lower carbon consumption and improve carbon reserves in their roots to cope with future drought conditions. In summary, long-term drought treatment improves plant survival under extreme drought stress. This study systematically illustrates the long-term drought legacy effects on short-term drought and re-irrigation responses.																			0098-8472	1873-7307				NOV	2023	215								105485	10.1016/j.envexpbot.2023.105485	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2023.105485		SEP 2023											WOS:001075630900001

Robustness of a meta-network to alternative habitat loss scenarios	OIKOS												Studying how habitat loss affects the tolerance of ecological networks to species extinction (i.e. their robustness) is key for our understanding of the influence of human activities on natural ecosystems. With networks typically occurring as local interaction networks interconnected in space (a meta-network), we may ask how the loss of specific habitat fragments affects the overall robustness of the meta-network. To address this question, for an empirical meta-network of plants, herbivores and natural enemies we simulated the removal of habitat fragments in increasing and decreasing order of area, age and connectivity for plant extinction and the secondary extinction of herbivores, natural enemies and their interactions. Meta-network robustness was characterized as the area under the curve of remnant species or interactions at the end of a fragment removal sequence. To pinpoint the effects of fragment area, age and connectivity, respectively, we compared the observed robustness for each removal scenario against that of a random sequence. The meta-network was more robust to the loss of old (i.e. long-fragmented), large, connected fragments than of young (i.e. recently fragmented), small, isolated fragments. Thus, young, small, isolated fragments may be particularly important to the conservation of species and interactions, while contrary to our expectations larger, more connected fragments contribute little to meta-network robustness. Our findings highlight the importance of young, small, isolated fragments as sources of species and interactions unique to the regional level. These effects may largely result from an unpaid extinction debt, whereby younger fragments are likely to lose species over time. Yet, there may also be more long-lasting effects from cultivated lands (e.g. water, fertilizers and restricted cattle grazing) and network complexity in small, isolated fragments. Such fragments may sustain important biological diversity in fragmented landscapes, but maintaining their conservation value may depend on adequate restoration strategies.

J	Zhao, XF; Huang, MB; Yan, XY; Yang, YN				Zhao, Xiaofang; Huang, Mingbin; Yan, Xiaoying; Yang, Yingnan			The impacts of climate change and cropping systems on soil water recovery in the 0-1500 cm soil profile after alfalfa	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) has played an important role in the "Grain-for-Green" program across the Chinese Loess Plateau but has characteristically high water consumption. Long-term growth significantly reduces soil water storage in the 0-1500 cm profile and results in an obvious decline of alfalfa yield. Fields planted with alfalfa for more than 8 years are often converted to annual crops (winter wheat or corn), but these annual crops planted after alfalfa suffer from low yield due to the reduced soil water content. The objectives of this study were to determine the time required for soil water recovery in the 0-1500 cm profile after fields cropped for 15 years with alfalfa are converted to annual crops and to evaluate the impacts of cropping systems, inter-annual climatic variation, and future climate change on the recovery time. Hydraulic parameters for six soil materials in the 0-1500 cm soil profile were calibrated using the measured soil water content in alfalfa fields from 2005 to 2020 and validated using soil water stable isotopic measurements in 2020. Using the calibrated soil hydraulic pa-rameters, the Hydrus-1D model was used to simulate soil water dynamics in the 0-1500 cm profile and determine the recovery time in two cropping systems (alfalfa-wheat and alfalfa-corn) with 53 climatic realizations gener-ated using random non-repeat sequences drawn from 53 years of observed climatic data (1968-2020) and 20 future climate data series projected by 10 GCM models under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios (2021-2100), respec-tively. The results showed that, under the 53 climatic realizations, the recovery time ranged from 14 to 44 years with a median of 27 years for the alfalfa-wheat system and from 11 to 31 years with a median of 18 years for the alfalfa-corn system. Under the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, the median recovery times were 37.5 and 42.5 years for the alfalfa-wheat system and 30 and 31.5 years for the alfalfa-corn system, respectively. Considering the long-term effects of alfalfa growth on land productivity, planting areas and growing time of alfalfa should be restricted to maintain sustainable agriculture in the study region.					li, bai/JNE-1502-2023; qi, li/JFE-7167-2023; xuan, li/JNI-7432-2023; li, wei/IUQ-2973-2023; Liu, Gui/JHU-8707-2023; peng, yan/JCO-1763-2023; peng, jy/JMB-2297-2023; Zhang, Yanyan/JFA-9161-2023; Yao, Chen/JVD-6226-2023; Yang, Ying/ABD-2481-2022; li, yao/IYJ-1364-2023; Yang, Ying/ADL-4165-2022; Li, Ly/JCD-4746-2023; liu, xq/JDW-2596-2023	peng, jy/0000-0001-9665-1059; Yang, Ying/0000-0002-3469-7681; 													0378-3774	1873-2283				OCT 1	2022	272								107878	10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107878	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107878		AUG 2022											WOS:000861238900004
J	Yu, L; Zhou, BT; Xu, YQ; Zhang, YX; Gu, FX				Yu, Li; Zhou, Botao; Xu, Yuqing; Zhang, Yongxiang; Gu, Fengxue			Projections of the Net Primary Production of Terrestrial Ecosystem and Spatiotemporal Responses to Climate Change in the Yangtze River Economic Belt	DIVERSITY-BASEL												Evaluating the responses of net primary productivity (NPP) to climate change is essential for regional ecosystem management and adaptations to climate change. The Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) is a key ecological functional area and hotspot of carbon sequestration in China due to the high degree of forest coverage. We used a process-based ecosystem model to project terrestrial NPP and analyzed the response to climate change over the 21st century in the YREB under two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios using the regional climate model. The results show that the projection of NPP generally increased by 13.5% under RCP4.5 and 16.4% under RCP8.5 in the middle of the century, by 23% under RCP4.5, and by 35% under RCP8.5 in the late term of the century compared with that from a reference period of current climate conditions (1985-2006). The rate of NPP change under the RCP8.5 scenario is higher than that under the RCP4.5 scenario. Similarly, the NPP is also projected to increase both with 1.5 and 2 degrees C global warming targets in the YREB. The magnitudes of NPP increment are approximately 14.7% with 1.5 degrees C and 21% with 2 degrees C warming targets compared with the current climate, which are higher than the average increments of China. Although NPP is projected to increase under the two scenarios, the tendency of NPP increasingly exhibits a slowdown after the 2060 s under the RCP4.5 scenario, and the growth rate of NPP is projected to drop in more than 31% of regional areas with the additional 0.5 degrees C warming. In contrast, under the RCP8.5 scenario, the trend in NPP keeps rising substantially, even above 2 degrees C global warming. However, the NPP in some provinces, including Jiangxi and Hunan, is projected to reduce at the end of the 21st century, probably because of temperature rises, precipitation decreases, and water demand increases. Generally, the NPP is projected to increase due to climate change, particularly temperature increase. However, temperature rising does not always show a positive effect on NPP increasing; the growth rate of NPP will slow down under the RCP4.5 scenario in the mid-late 21st century, and NPP will also reduce by the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario in some places, probably presenting some risks to terrestrial ecosystems in these areas, in terms of reduced functions and service decline, a weakened capacity of carbon sequestration, and reduced agricultural production.						zhou, Botao/0000-0002-5995-2378														1424-2818				MAY	2022	14	5							327	10.3390/d14050327	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d14050327													WOS:000802595900001

To solve these issues, a total of 32 papers on the subject of the relative film coverage durability (RFCD) on positive covering effect from papers published before July 2019 were selected and analyzed by meta-analysis. The results showed that the tobacco relative yield (RY), relative profit (RP), and relative fine and medium (RFM) ratio improved by 11.2%, 12.9%, and 12%, respectively, under fully covered compared with the uncovered tobacco in the whole growth period. The RY0.33<RFCD<0.66 and RP0.33<RFCD<0.66 of removed PE treatments significantly improved by 4.3% and 4.0%, respectively, compared with the fully covered treatments. The RFM did not show significance with the fully covered treatments. The RY0.33<RFCD<0.66 was the highest in the low altitude (less than 1,000m) region; however, the RY under the fully covered treatments was the greatest in the high altitude (more than 1,000m) region. Random effect analysis showed that the model between RFCD and RY was RY = 1 + 0.275 x (1 - RFCD) - 0.357 x (1 - RFCD)(2), and the RYmax(1.053) was reached with RFCD = 0.62 (removed PE after covering for 80 days) in the high-altitude region. In the low altitude region, RFM = 1 + 0.205 x (1 - RFCD) 0.246 x (1 - RFCD)(2), and the RFMmax(1.043) was obtained under the treatments with RFCD = 0.58 (removed PE after covering for 75 days). The findings determined the optimum film (PE) covering period of tobacco and provided a crucial theoretical basis for the degradable polymer film material design, synthesis, and manufacturing in different regions.

Provenance variation, genetic parameters and potential gains from selection for biomass and cineole production in three-year-old<i>Eucalyptus loxophleba</i>subsp.<i>gratiae</i>progeny trials	AUSTRALIAN FORESTRY												Ninety families from six provenances of Eucalyptus loxophleba subsp.gratiae were established near Brookton, Western Australia, and Condobolin, New South Wales, and 89 of these same families were established at Monarto, South Australia. All three trials were assessed at age three years for biomass productivity and the trial at Brookton was assessed for leaf cineole concentration. Provenance performance across the sites was most similar between Monarto and Condobolin, while the ranking of provenances was more divergent between those sites and Brookton. Presence or absence of unstable families may change provenance ranking. Additive variance was not significant for the Condobolin trial. Heritability of green biomass at age three years was (h) over cap (2) = 0.19 +/- 0.06 and (h) over cap (2) = 0.16 +/- 0.05 at Monarto and Brookton, respectively. The heritability of leaf cineole concentration at Brookton was (h) over cap (2) = 0.50 +/- 0.08 and whole-tree cineole yield, (h) over cap (2) = 0.11 +/- 0.04. The cross-site genetic correlation between Brookton and Monarto was r(g) = 0.55 +/- 0.20, suggesting the presence of some genotype x environment interaction. Removing the six most unstable families resulted in a cross-site genetic correlation of r(g) = 0.97 +/- 0.25. Estimated mean gains from selection scenarios treating Brookton and Monarto as representing two separate environments or as a single environment differed by about 5.0%. The exclusion of six unstable families reduced that difference to 1.4%. Selection on biomass alone may result in a slight increase in total cineole yield per tree but, in this experiment, it resulted in a reduction in mean leaf cineole concentration. Leaf cineole concentration used in conjunction with biomass may be a useful selection criterion in the absence of data for total mass of cineole produced per tree.																			0004-9158	2325-6087				APR 2	2020	83	2					75	90		10.1080/00049158.2020.1753294	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00049158.2020.1753294													WOS:000547060200004

In this study, the effect of gravel coverage on the hydrodynamic parameters characterizing the overland flow was investigated through indoor artificially simulated scouring experiments, considering ten different gravel coverages, four slope gradients, and nine flow discharges. The results demonstrated significant differences in hydrodynamic parameters under various experimental conditions (P < 0.01). The flow depth exhibited a linear increase with increasing gravel coverage. Compared to flow velocity observed on non-gravel-covered slope, the reduction percentage of flow velocity ranged from 13.62 % to 72.4 % on gravel-covered slopes. Furthermore, a prediction model was developed to quantify the impact of gravel coverage on the mean flow velocity of overland flow. The model achieved a high R-2 of 0.858 and a low RME of 13.61 %. The experiments revealed that the overland flow was distributed in the "virtual laminar"-subcritical and transitional-supercritical zones, with mutual restrictions between the influence of gravel coverage and slope gradient on the flow regime. Finally, it was observed that the Darcy-Weisbach resistance coefficient increased with an increase in gravel coverage. These findings provide a solid theoretical basis for optimizing soil erosion prediction models based on the hydrodynamic characteristics of overland flow, and offer guidance for the rational allocation of soil and water conservation measures for gravel-covered slopes.

J	Li, YY; Zhang, FB; Yang, MY; Zhang, JQ; Xie, YG				Li, Yuanyuan; Zhang, Fengbao; Yang, Mingyi; Zhang, Jiaqiong; Xie, Yingge			Impacts of biochar application rates and particle sizes on runoff and soil loss in small cultivated loess plots under simulated rainfall	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Increasing literature suggests that biochar can be used to improve soil fertility and subsequently benefit crop yield. However, the effects of biochar application rates and particle sizes on soil erosion processes have yet to be fully identified. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the influence of biochar with different application rates and particle sizes on soil erosion. Addition of biochar to loess generally increased the mean time to runoff by 19.47% relative to the control. The time to runoff decreased with an increase in the biochar application rates and fluctuated with a decrease in biochar particle sizes. The combined 1% and <0.25 mm biochar treatment yielded the longest time to runoff (2.97 min) and the lowest runoff (36.23 kg m(-2) h(-1) ) and soil loss (1.33 kg m(-2) min(-1)). Biochar addition decreased the total runoff volume by 12.21% and generally inhibited soil loss under lower application rates (1% and 3%) while promoting soil loss under higher application rates (5% and 7%). With a decrease in biochar particle size, total runoff volume increased under the 5% and 7% biochar, but no uniform trend was observed under the 1% and 3% biochar treatments. The total soil loss increased with increasing biochar application rates, whereas a negative trend was observed with decreasing biochar particle sizes. The contribution of biochar application rates to runoff and soil loss rates was distinctly greater than the biochar particle sizes. Additionally, biochar addition could increase >2 mm water-stable soil aggregates and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) in this study. We inferred that the positive effects on soil and water loss were potentially due to the improvement in >2 mm water-stable soil aggregates and K-sat. The results implied that soil-biochar additions could be a potential measure for conserving soil and water in the Loess Plateau. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Total 98 tree-ring cores of Robinia pseudoacacia L. were collected from four stand age-class on LP. We redefined the growth period of R. pseudoacacia based on all combined tree rings and analyzed the influencing factors of each growth period based on the detrending tree ring width chronologies. The effects of climate, tree size, element concentrations, and their interaction effects on tree growth were investigated using linear model and variation partitioning analysis. The results showed that radial growth of R. pseudoacacia was redefined as two growth periods: Decreased Growth Period (1-20 years) and Stable Growth Period (21-40 years). Climate factors mainly controlled tree radial growth in the Stable Growth Period rather than the Decreased Growth Period. The radial growth in the Stable Growth Period was primarily promoted by summer drought, which has 34.1 % of the variables effect percentage. Tree radial growth of R. pseudoacacia in the Decreased Growth Period was mainly promoted by phosphorus (P) concentration, which explained 41.1 % of the variables effect percentage. Contrary to expectations, tree size and the interaction effect of all variables hardly impact on tree radial growth in the two growth periods. Our research illustrated that appropriate nutrient supplementation, such as P elements, occurred during the Decreased Growth Period, followed by thinning practice and tree composition to alleviate climate effects. Overall, our results provide valuable information for formulating appropriate management strategies for R. pseudoacacia plantations on the LP in changing climate.																			1125-7865	1612-0051				OCT	2023	81								126132	10.1016/j.dendro.2023.126132	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dendro.2023.126132		SEP 2023											WOS:001079495600001

However, the studies on rill network development remain inconclusive. This study aimed to investigate the temporal and spatial development of hillslope rill networks and their characteristics based on rainfall simulations and field observations. A soil pan (10.0m long x 3.0m wide x 0.5m deep) on a 20 degrees slope was applied three successive simulated rains at two intensities of 50 and 100mmh(-1). The field observations were performed on two bare hillslope runoff plots (10.0m long x 3.0m wide) at 20 degrees. Three typical erosive natural rainfall events were observed in the field, and rills were measured in detail, similar to the laboratory rainfall simulation. The results indicated that with increases in rainfall events, the rill network morphology varied from incipient formation to the maximum drainage network density. Four rill network development indicators (rill distribution density, distance between rills, rill bifurcation number, and confluence point number) exhibited different changes over time and space. Among the four indicators, the rill bifurcation number was the best indicator for describing rill network development. Rill flow energy increased and decreased cyclically on a slope ranging between similar to 3 and 4m. Moreover, rill networks on loessial hillslopes generally evolved into dendritic rather than parallel forms. The development characteristics of the rill network were relatively similar between the laboratory simulation and natural field conditions. Over time, rill erosion control measures become increasingly difficult to implement as the rill network develops. The morphology of eroding rills evolved over time and space, which led to corresponding rill network development. Further study should quantify the impacts of rill network development on soil degradation and land development. (C) 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Zhao, M; Liu, SH; Sun, YR; Chen, YM				Zhao, Min; Liu, Shaohua; Sun, Yarong; Chen, Yunming			Does stand density affect understory vegetation and soil properties of differently aged<i> Robinia</i><i> pseudoacacia</i> plantations?	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Robinia pseudoacacia is the most important tree species used for afforestation on the Chinese Loess Plateau. However, most R. pseudoacacia plantations face environmental problems due to inappropriate initial densities. The sustainable development of R. pseudoacacia plantations is challenging due to significant knowledge gaps regarding the appropriate stand densities for maximizing ecological benefits. Herein, R. pseudoacacia plantations of three age classes-young, middle-aged, and mature-were sampled in the loess hilly-gully region of northern Shaanxi Province, China. Based on stand density, R. pseudoacacia plantations in each age class were categorized as low (<1000 trees ha(-1)), medium (1000-1500 trees ha(-1)), and high (>1500 trees ha(-1)) density. We analyzed the effects of stand density on soil physicochemical properties, understory vegetation community structure, and ecosystem multifunctionality. In young stands, a medium stand density significantly increased the Shannon-Wiener index, species richness, and above-ground biomass of herbaceous communities. In middle-aged stands, stand density had no significant effects on understory diversity, whereas medium-density stands showed increased understory above-ground biomass. In mature stands, low-density stands significantly increased understory above-ground biomass and species richness of herbaceous communities. In all age classes, stand density did not significantly affect shrubby community composition, but herbaceous communities shifted compositionally towards shade-tolerant and drought-tolerant species as stand density increased. In the soils of young and middle-aged stands, organic carbon, ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, available phosphorus, and water content were highest in medium-density stands, whereas in mature stands, these variables were highest in low-density plantations. In young, middle-aged, and mature stands, the ecosystem multifunctionality indices were highest at densities of 1000-1500, 1000-1500, and < 1000 trees ha(-1), respectively. We concluded that the effects of stand density on ecosystem functions in R. pseudoacacia plantations varied with stand age. Our findings highlight a need to implement age-based stand density management strategies for R. pseudoacacia plantations to improve their ecological benefits.																			0378-1127	1872-7042				NOV 15	2023	548								121444	10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121444	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121444		SEP 2023											WOS:001083359900001

Batch adsorption test results showed that HLB has a strong ability to remove norfloxacin at a wide pH. The maximum adsorption capacity was 529.85 mg/g at 298 K, which is 1.52-fold to 201.46-fold higher than that of other reported materials. HLB showed good selectivity and recycling ability for the adsorption of norfloxacin, the removal rate of NOR reached 99.5% in the presence of competitive ions and maintained at least 98% removal rate after 12 adsorption cycles. The removal rate of norfloxacin in different water reached more than 99% within 8 mins. Pore filling, electrostatic interaction, pi-pi interaction, and hydrogen bond contributed significantly to the removal of norfloxacin. Among them, the highly aromatized structure of HLB and the abundant oxygen-containing functional groups (-OH, C-O, etc.) promoted pi-pi interaction.

However, the synergistic agricultural production mode of economy and ecology is still rare in this region. In this study, a 4-year fixed-point experiment was conducted to study the soil characteristics, production and ecological effects of three typical planting modes (continuous maize [CM], continuous peanuts [CP] and a rotational strip intercropping of maize and peanuts [RMP]). The results indicated that RMP had multiple benefits compared with CM and CP: it improved the soil carbon stocks in the 10-20 cm soil layer by 20.11 % and 34.19 %, respectively; it increased the grain yield and economic benefits, with an increase of 19.68 % and 17.29 % in the average annual yield of maize and peanuts, respectively, and an increase in revenue of 23.14 % and 13.99 %, respectively; the land use efficiency can be improved and the average land equivalent ratio of 4 years is 1.20; the soil erosion and the resulting carbon emissions were reduced, with a decrease in the intensity of erosion of 8.28 % and 45.45 %, respectively, and a decrease of 22.73 % and 45.16 % in the resulting carbon emissions, respectively. Correlation analysis showed that the improvement in soil characteristics, such as the modification of soil organic carbon, mineralized carbon, and an increase in available nutrients, helps to increase the yields of maize and peanut in the RMP. In conclusion, RMP resulted in multiple benefits and was more consistent with sustainable agricultural production in the agropastoral ecotone region.

Using simulation experiments and in-suit observations, this study evaluated the intervention of weathered bedrock particles on profile infiltration and evaporation, investigated rock core sample characteristics and detected the spatiotemporal water variation in hillslopes of woodland and shrubland. Results showed that adding weathered bedrock particles interfered with infiltration and evaporation processes. Infiltration simulation discovered that stable infiltration rates increased linearly with weathered bedrock thicknesses, which accelerated by 0.5-5.7 times more than bulk soil layers. Interestingly, due to water separation at soil-rock interface, there existed nonlinear initial and average infiltration intensity fluctuations. Evaporation simulation demonstrated that cumulative evaporation presented a linear decrease with weathered bedrock, while the initial daily evaporation intensity increased, reaching a maximum of 15.4 & PLUSMN; 2.2 mm d-1. Moreover, borehole investigations manifested that weathered bedrock layers presented a thickness of more than 5.0 m, and the weathering intensity gradually decreased with depth, which was related to terrains and locations in hillslopes. Furthermore, profile water movement monitoring between woodland and shrubland slopes demonstrated that weathered bedrock optimized profile hydrological allocation. The average rock moisture reached about twofold than soil moisture, with average soil and rock moisture of 0.07 & PLUSMN; 0.04 cm3 cm-3 and 0.15 & PLUSMN; 0.05 cm3 cm-3 in woodland, 0.08 & PLUSMN; 0.03 cm3 cm- 3 and 0.15 & PLUSMN; 0.03 cm3 cm- 3 in shrubland, respectively. Besides, the profile water storage changed dynamically in equilibrium and escalated linearly with weathering layer thickness. Fundamentally, a conceptual structure model covering soil and rock water balance, vegetation dynamics, and climate change was constructed and discussed throughout the Earth's critical zone, which was then applied in describing water circulation participating by rock moisture under relative water shortage and abundance scenarios in loess hilly-gully regions. This study would furnish insights for improving and deepening the water cycle in shallow soils, and provide new horizons for enriching water resources utilization under climate change.

However, in black locust forests in this region, throughfall and its spatial heterogeneity and controlling factors remain unclear. We examined throughfall, its spatial variability and the effects of rainfall characteristics and vegetation structure on throughfall in a black locust stand experiment. Of the 489.72 mm cumulative gross rainfall during 20 sampled events, the average of throughfall for all trees, interception loss (IL) and stemflow (SF) were 380.93 mm (77.71%), 98.48 mm (20.19%) and 10.30 mm (2.10%), respectively. For a single tree, measured throughfall percentage decreased from upper to bottom in the canopy vertical layer, and the horizontal distribution increased with distance from the trunk. A correlation analysis between throughfall and rainfall characteristics, indicated that rainfall amount had a greater effect on throughfall than rainfall intensity and duration. Throughfall generally occurred following rainfall events of more than 0.76 mm for black locust. Throughfall percentage initially increased weakly, and then decreased with increasing rainfall intensity, while it initially increased, and then remained constant with increasing rainfall duration. Throughfall percentage decreased with increasing leaf area index (LAI) during differently-sized rainfall events, whereas throughfall variations were different in differently-sized rainfall events. Throughfall is affected by tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH), canopy width and canopy openness to some degree, while the effects were higher in larger storms than in smaller storms. Our study highlights the need to consider the effects of throughfall on hydrological processes, particularly for forest management in semiarid regions.

In this study, we conducted a pot experiment to investigate how biochar in soil (20, 40 g.kg(-1)), chicken manure in soil (20, 40 g.kg(-1)), or a combination of biochar and chicken manure in soil (each at 20 g.kg(-1)) effect maize growth, Pb uptake, leaves' antioxidant enzymatic activities, and soil enzyme activities under artificial conditions to simulate moderate soil pollution (800 Pb mg.kg(-1)). The results showed that all biochar and/or chicken manure treatments significantly (P < 0.05) increased maize plant height, biomass, and superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) activity but decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) content. These results indicated that amending the soil with biochar and/or chicken manure could alleviate Pb's phytotoxicity. The biochar and/or chicken manure treatments remarkably decreased the Pb concentration in maize roots, stems, leaves, bioconcentration factor (BCF), translocation factor (TF), and available Pb concentration in the soil. Amending the soil with chicken manure alone was more effective at increasing maize growth and antioxidant enzymatic activity; the biochar treatment alone was more effective at inducing soil alkalinization and contributing to Pb immobilization. The combined use of biochar and chicken manure had an additive effect and produced the largest increases in maize growth, leaves' antioxidant enzymatic activity, and soil enzyme activity. Their combined use also led to the most significant decreases in maize tissues Pb and soil available Pb. These results suggest that a combination of biochar and chicken manure was more effective at reducing soil Pb bioavailability and uptake by maize tissues, and increasing maize growth. This combination increased plant height by 43.23% and dry weight by 69.63% compared to the control.

An additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model and a genotype main effect (G) and genotype and environment interaction (GE), (GGE) biplot were used to analyze the data. Results showed that the grain yields of summer maize cultivars were remarkably influenced by environment (E), genotype (G), and genotype by environment interaction (GEI). The effect of GEI was 1.53 times higher than that of genotypes. The cultivars Hengyu1182, Longhua369 and J1302 exhibited good yield and stability. Among sites Baoding, Xinle, Yutian and Zhengding showed good discriminating ability while Langfang, Gaoyang and Tanchang sites displayed good representativeness. In correlation analysis, agronomic traits, such as ear length, kernel row number, and 1000-grain weight were positively correlated with maize yield. Conversely, barren ear tip was negatively correlated with yield. This study confirmed that the AMMI model and GGE biplot are effective methods for exploring the stability and adaptability of genotypes and representative patterns of biplots in crop breeding and subsequent cultivar recommendations.

To reverse the situation, inclusive businesses, such as malt barley production, are being promoted. However, the determinants of inclusion in the malt barley industry and the food security impacts of inclusion have not been studied systematically. Thus, the objectives of the present research were twofold, namely to investigate the reason for inclusion in, or exclusion from, the malt barley industry, and to examine the food security impacts of inclusion in three villages in Lay Gayint district, northern Ethiopia. The research used a mixed method approach. Survey data were collected from 140 non-included and 103 included farm households. In addition, focus group discussions were held with 18 included and 18 non-included households, as well as with six officials. Three multiple dimensions of food security were considered: food availability, measured by months per year during which households reported having an adequate food supply; food access, indicated by coping strategies employed by the households to secure sufficient food; and food utilisation, measured by food calorie intake, food variety and diet diversity scores, and three anthropometric measures for children under 5 years of age. Quantitative data were analysed using a two stage least square regression model, while qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. The results indicate that inclusion in the malt barley industry is determined by higher economic status. Older farmers and farmers living far from the main town of the district were excluded. We also show that inclusion in the malt barley industry results in higher incomes, better food access and higher diet diversity scores, but has less impact in terms of food availability, food variety score, per capita kilocalorie consumption and child growth. Based on these findings, we suggest that, in the context of inclusive business for those at the 'bottom of the pyramid', one needs to re-frame the targeting process of chain governance and integrate other actors who work on food and nutrition components of rural livelihoods.																			1876-4517	1876-4525				AUG	2019	11	4					953	966		10.1007/s12571-019-00939-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-019-00939-6													WOS:000482900700014

Occupational Health Risks and Hazards Among the Fisherfolk in Kampi Samaki, Lake Baringo, Kenya	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH INSIGHTS												Globally, almost 2.78 million deaths that occur annually are attributed to work-related health risks. Worldwide and, especially, in developing countries, about 20% to 50% of the workers are exposed to health risks. Fishing is an ancient occupation, and like many others, it is characterized by numerous health risks and hazards. This study sought to understand the exposure of fisherfolk to human health risks, through fish handling and processing in Lake Baringo, Kenya. The study adopted a cross-sectional social survey design. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select respondents for this study. A semi-structured questionnaire was administered to the respondents to collect data on risks involved during the handling and processing of fish. Key informant interviews and observation checklists were also used to collect more information. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze data. Inferential statistics included Pearson chi(2) test, which was used to test the association of various factors on the encounter with occupational health risks. The level of significance was tested at alpha = 0.05. The study findings reveal the fisherfolk-encountered risks such as cuts, eye irritability, sunburns, skin burn, cold, falls, and musculoskeletal injuries during their work. The results showed that only 12% of the fisherfolk use personal protective equipments (PPEs) at work. Pearson chi(2) test analysis showed there was an association between gender and gender roles (chi(2) = 39.517, P < .05). In addition, an association was revealed between occupational health risks and gender (chi(2) = 16.283, P < .05). There was also an association between occupational hazards and gender (chi(2) = 21.352, P < .05). However, there was no association revealed between occupational health risk and marital status (chi(2) = 1.305, P > .05) and PPEs (chi(2) = 1.089, P > .05). Furthermore, results indicate that 61% of the fisherfolk who suffered from occupational health risks missed work. The study concludes that all the fisherfolk at Kampi Samaki are exposed to various health risks while working, which is thus likely to affect their health. We recommend public health campaigns to sensitize fisherfolk on the associated risks in fish handling and processing. There is also a need for health campaigns for the fisherfolk to appreciate the need for First Aid Kits during the fishing operations.

The catalyst oxidation for preparation of HA is an environment-friendly and value-added strategy. A green catalyst of alpha-MnO2/kaolinite (alpha-MnO2/Kln) was prepared for oxidizing weathered coal for conversion to HA. The effects of ball-milling and catalysis for HA were studied. The catalysts contain oxygen vacancies and lower average oxidation state (3.55), which facilitates the oxidation reaction. Compared to untreated weathered coal HA (WHA), the yield of ball-milling and catalyst treated weathered coal HA (BC/WHA) increased by 18.67%. The catalyst treated weathered coal HA (C/WHA) and BC/WHA displayed better quality, including higher oxygen content (29.90% and 28.68%), increased O/C ratio (0.52 and 0.52), and higher total acidic groups (7.88 and 7.64 meq/g) than those of WHA (25.43%, 0.44, 6.46 meq/g, respectively). The small-molecule fatty acid (79.07%) of C/WHA was obviously higher than that of WHA (66.03%). The active substance of sterols content (19.95%) of BC/WHA increased significantly. These proved the bio-activity of C/WHA and BC/WHA was improved, and alpha-MnO2/Kln played an effective catalytic oxidation. Overall, BC/WHA has high extraction yield and enhanced bio-activity, making it highly HA output efficient and suitable for agricultural applications.																			0926-6690	1872-633X				DEC 15	2023	206								117623	10.1016/j.indcrop.2023.117623	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2023.117623													WOS:001104793200001

Past studies have shown that the net force (the sum of electrostatic, hydration, and van der Waals forces) between soil particles had crucial effects on the stability of soil aggregates. However, little is known about the influence of vegetation restoration on the net force and soil erosion resistance, which hinders our quantitative understanding of this process at the particle to particle level. In this study, to quantitatively analyze the influence of vegetation restoration on soil net force and their relationship with aggregate stability and erosion resistance, we collected soil samples from four different restoration stages (including farmland, grassland, shrubland, and forest), then used Na+-saturated soil aggregates (1 to 5 mm model aggregates) to conduct our experiments. The stability of soil aggregates and erosion resistance were tested through the wet sieving method and rainfall simulation experiments. Our results indicated that the soil net force was repulsive and decreased with vegetation restoration. The stability of soil aggregates and erosion resistance increased with vegetation restoration. With the decrease of electrolyte concentration, the net force and splash erosion rate both first increased (from 1 to 10-2 mol L-1) then remained stable (from 10-2 to 10-4 mol L-1), while the soil aggregate stability first decreased (from 1 to 10-2 mol L-1) then remained stable (from 10-2 to 10-4 mol L-1). The experimental results of soil aggregate stability and splash erosion rate changing with electrolyte concentration could be well explained by soil net force. Moreover, the rate of splash erosion and the stability of soil aggregates showed a significantly negative linear relationship (P < 0.01). Overall, the results indicated that the vegetation restoration process could reduce the net repulsive force of soil particles and thus increase the stability of soil aggregates and erosion resistance. These findings provided quantitative information about the mechanistic understanding of vegetation restoration improving soil erosion resistance.

We performed pot experiments to grow alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and erect milkvetch (Astragalus adsurgens Pall.) in soils treated with different rates of CFA, in order to investigate the impacts of CFA on the accumulation and translocation of REEs such as lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), scandium (Sc) and yttrium (Y). The results showed that La, Ce, Sc and Y concentrations were considerably higher in the CFA than in soils, but adding CFA to soils did not always significantly increase their concentrations in plants. The element abundance in soils and CFA always followed the order of Ce > La > Y > Sc, but the element bioaccumulation factor was generally in the order of Sc > Y > La > Ce. In plants, La, Ce, Sc and Y concentrations generally followed the order of root > shoot and leaf > stem, with Ce concentrations being always higher than La and Y concentrations. Most of these elements absorbed were sequestered in roots without being further transported to the aerial parts. The root-to-shoot translocation factor of Sc was the highest, but the stem-to-leaf translocation factor of Sc was the lowest among the elements studied. The biogeochemical behaviours of Sc were quite different from those of La, Ce and Y. Adding CFA to the soils often considerably increased the amounts of La, Ce, Sc and Y accumulated in shoots due to significant biomass increase. Furthermore, REE speciations in the topsoil can be changed by both CFA addition and plant recycling. Therefore, land application of CFA for revegetation and soil reclamation proposes can affect the biogeochemical behaviours of La, Ce, Sc and Y.

Some studies using the model aggregates find that soil internal forces exert an important impact on soil aggregate stability. However, the effect of soil internal forces on the stability of natural soil aggregates during vegetation restoration has been little studied. Methods Five different succession stages (including farmland, grassland, shrubland, early forest, and climax forest) were chosen in the Ziwuling forest region (in the central part of the Loess Plateau, China), and the size distribution and stability of natural soil aggregates under different succession stages were investigated through dry sieving and wet sieving with ethanol and deionized water prewetting. Results The size distribution of aggregates determined by dry sieving showed decreased first and then increased with decreasing particle size, dominant sizes were 5-1- and < 0.15-mm fractions. The ethanol prewetting treatment showed a distribution similar to that determined by dry sieving. The size distribution of aggregates in deionized water prewetting treatment was mainly < 0.15-mm fractions. Moreover, the mean weight diameter values of farmland, grassland, shrubland, early forest, and climax forest soils determined in ethanol treatment (MWDe) were 4.62, 1.45, 1.31, 1.32, and 1.17 times than those in deionized water treatment (MWDw). In addition, in the fast wetting process, the preservation rate of soil aggregates was higher in 0.5-0.053-mm fractions than in > 0.5-mm fractions. The relative internal force index (RII) of grassland, shrubland, early forest, and climax forest soils decreased by 47%, 54%, 55%, and 64% compared with that of farmland soil, respectively. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that soil internal forces could significantly break down the aggregates and lead to decreasing water stability of aggregates. The vegetation restoration process decreased the repulsive soil internal forces, thereby decreasing the degree of disintegration of aggregates and consequently increased the water stability of aggregates.

In this study, four grassland communities after abandonment of 2, 7, 15 and 30 years on the semiarid Loess Plateau were selected, and canopy storage capacities, canopy structures and species compositions were examined in the growth period (May to September). Canopy, living plant, standing litter and floor litter storage capacities ranged from 0.11-0.56, 0.030-0.51, 0.0070-0.079 and 0.013-0.21 mm, respectively, and all exhibited an increasing trend with restoration year. Canopy storage capacity, vegetation coverage and aboveground biomass reached the maximum in August. Standing and floor litter storage capacities had the highest correlations with their biomass weights. Species diversity reached the maximum in 15 years abandoned grassland, with no significant monthly change. Annual forb, annual grass, perennial forb and perennial forb/grass were the typical dominant species type of 2, 7, 15 and 30 years abandoned grasslands, respectively. Perennial forbs (Artemisia gmelinii, Lespedeza davurica) had higher water storage than those of annual forb (Artemisia capillaris) and grasses (Setaria viridis, Roegneria kamoji). Path analysis revealed that fresh aboveground biomass and dominant species type mainly affected canopy storage capacity. No significant correlations were found between storage capacity and species diversity indexes. These results highlighted the importance of vegetation aboveground biomass and species functional group for evaluating grassland hydrological function and adopting suitable restoration strategy.

J	Bai, X; Zhang, LH; He, CS; Zhu, Y				Bai, Xiao; Zhang, Lanhui; He, Chansheng; Zhu, Yi			Estimating Regional Soil Moisture Distribution Based on NDVI and Land Surface Temperature Time Series Data in the Upstream of the Heihe River Watershed, Northwest China	REMOTE SENSING												Temporal and spatial variability of soil moisture has an important impact on hydrological processes in mountainous areas. Understanding such variability requires soil moisture datasets at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Remote sensing is a very effective method to obtain surface (similar to 5 cm depth) soil moisture at the regional scale but cannot directly measure soil moisture at deep soil layers (>5 cm depth) currently. This study chose the upstream of the Heihe River Watershed in the Qilian Mountain Ranges in Northwest China as the study area to estimate the profile soil moisture (0-70 cm depth) at the regional scale using satellite Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) products. The study area was divided into 31 zones according to the combination of altitude, vegetation and soil type. Long-term in situ soil moisture observation stations were set up at each of the zones. Soil moisture probe, ECH2O, was used to collect soil moisture at five layers (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50 and 50-70 cm) continuously. Multiple linear regression equations of time series MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) NDVI, LST and soil moisture were developed for each of the five soil layers at the 31 zones to estimate the soil moisture (0-70 cm) on a regional scale with a spatial resolution of 1 km(2)and a temporal resolution of 16-d from October, 2013 to September, 2016. The correlation coefficient R of the regression equations was between 0.47 and 0.94, the RMSE was 0.03, indicating that the estimation method based on the MODIS NDVI and LST data was suitable and could be applied to alpine mountainous areas with complex topography, soil and vegetation types. The overall pattern of soil moisture spatial distribution indicated that soil moisture was higher in the eastern region than in the western region, and the soil moisture content in the whole study area was 14.5%. The algorithm and results provide novel applications of remote sensing to support soil moisture data acquisition and hydrological research in mountainous areas.

In such soils, water infiltration and deep percolation can be enhanced by constructing deep ditches filled with permeable materials, such as sand. Laboratory experiments were conducted to examine the effect of sand ditch installed across the slope of a soil box, 50 x 20 x 20 cm(3), on runoff interception and water infiltration of clay soil packed at two bulk densities, 1240 and 1510 kg/m(3). The experiments were carried out under laboratory conditions using simulated steady flow of about 20 cm/h for a duration of 60 min. Results showed that sand ditches highly reduced runoff and largely enhanced water infiltration into soils. In low-density soil, the average runoff was 15% of inflow volume but reduced to zero in the presence of sand ditches thus increasing soil water storage by 15%. In high-density soil, the presence of sand ditches was more effective; infiltration volume increased by 156% compared to control. The WASH_2D model was used to simulate water flow in the presence of sand ditches; it showed to increase water infiltration and soil-moisture storage thus improving crop production in drylands.

J	Wang, YP; Liu, WZ; Li, G; Yan, WM; Gao, GY				Wang, Yaping; Liu, Wenzhao; Li, Gang; Yan, Weiming; Gao, Guangyao			A Bibliometric Analysis of Soil and Water Conservation in the Loess Tableland-Gully Region of China	WATER												The tableland-gully region is one of the main topographic-ecological units in the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP), and the soil in this region suffers from serious water erosion. In recent years, much work has been conducted to control soil erosion in this area. This paper summarized the development of soil and water conservation researches in the CLP from the bibliometric perspective based on the Science Citation Index (SCI) and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. The quantity of SCI literatures has increased rapidly since 2007, with an average annual growth rate of 21.4%, and the quantity of CNKI literatures in the last decade accounted for 62% of the past 30 years. The development trends showed that early SCI research was related to loess geology in the context of ecological remediation, while the CNKI literature focused on agricultural production under comprehensive management. Over time, the research themes of the two databases gradually became unified, i.e., the management of sloping farmland and the improvement of agricultural productivity. Subsequently, the themes gradually extended to the disposition of comprehensive control measures for soil erosion and the environmental effect of agro-fruit ecosystems. The highly cited papers mainly focused on soil reservoir reconstruction, soil erosion factors, and environmental effects of vegetation restoration. Two aspects need further study, including (i) the effect of soil erosion control under different ecological remediation patterns; and, (ii) the ecosystem maintenance mechanism and regulation approaches that are based on the sustainable utilization of soil and water resources in the tableland-gully region of the Loess Plateau.

J	Zhang, YH; Xu, ZG; Li, J; Wang, R				Zhang, Yuanhong; Xu, Zonggui; Li, Jun; Wang, Rui			Optimum Planting Density Improves Resource Use Efficiency and Yield Stability of Rainfed Maize in Semiarid Climate	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Increasing planting density is an effective strategy for improving maize productivity, but grain yield does not increase linearly with the increase in plant density, especially in semiarid environments. However, how planting density regulates the integrated utilization of key input resources (i.e., radiation, water, and nutrients) to affect maize production is not clear. To evaluate the effects of planting density and cultivar on maize canopy structure, photosynthetic characteristics, yield, and resource use efficiency, we conducted a successive field experiment from 2013 to 2018 in Heyang County (Shaanxi Province, China) using three different cultivars [i.e., Yuyu22 (C1), Zhengdan958 (C2), and Xianyu335 (C3)] at four planting densities [i.e., 52,500 (D1), 67,500 (D2), 82,500 (D3), and 97,500 (D4) plants ha(-1)]. Increasing planting density significantly increased the leaf area index (LAI) and the amount of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (IPAR), thereby promoting plant growth and crop productivity. However, increased planting density reduced plant photosynthetic capacity [net photosynthetic rate (Pn)], stomatal conductance (Gc), and leaf chlorophyll content. These alterations constitute key mechanisms underlying the decline in crop productivity and yield stability at high planting density. Although improved planting density increased IPAR, it did not promote higher resource use efficiency. Compared with the D1 treatment, the grain yield, precipitation use efficiency (PUE), radiation use efficiency (RUE), and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) increased by 5.6-12.5%, 2.8-7.1%, and -2.1 to 1.6% in D2, D3, and D4 treatments, respectively. These showed that pursuing too high planting density is not a desirable strategy in the rainfed farming system of semiarid environments. In addition, density-tolerant cultivars (C2 and C3) showed better canopy structure and photosynthetic capacity and recorded higher yield stability and resource use efficiency. Together, these results suggest that growing density-tolerant cultivars at moderate planting density could serve as a promising approach for stabilizing grain yield and realizing the sustainable development of agriculture in semiarid regions.					liu, junyang/IXD-1201-2023; liu, junyang/IXD-1252-2023; wang, yu/IUQ-6654-2023; liu, jiaming/IWE-3196-2023; Liu, Yujie/IWU-6535-2023	Liu, Yujie/0000-0002-1153-6156													1664-462X					NOV 12	2021	12								752606	10.3389/fpls.2021.752606	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.752606								34868140					WOS:000726110700001

The results revealed that early sown crop attained more accumulated heat units, and yield decreased with delay in sowing. The maximum and minimum temperatures during reproductive stage were positively correlated with seed yield while negatively associated with vegetative and pod development stages. Photosynthetic active radiation absorption (APAR) was maximum in June sowing in semi -determinate JS 97-52 variety at pod formation stage. Maximum leaf area index (LAI) exhibited in June sown for JS 97-52 variety during pod formation stage. Seed yield increase with increased in APAR and LAI during pod formation stage.

The LN-tolerant wild soybean seedlings showed a stronger ability to maintain photosynthesis and nutrient balance than common wild soybean. A total of 52 differentially accumulated metabolites, mainly related to carbon and N metabolism, were identified between the control and the LN treatment group. In general, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, shikimic acid pathway, synthetase/glutamate synthase (GS/GOGAT) cycle and accumulation of most organic acids were enhanced in LN-tolerant wild soybean, while reduced in common wild soybean under LN stress compared with their respective control group. Moreover, glycolysis, sugar and polyol and fatty acid metabolism increased in both wild soybean genotypes, and increased more in LN-tolerant wild soybean. A total of 3381 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in leaves of both wild soybean genotypes and the expressed level of DEGs associated with sugars, polyols, fatty acids and energy metabolism was significantly higher in LN-tolerant wild soybean than in common wild soybean, consistent with changes in metabolite level. Our results suggest new ideas for the study of LN tolerance of wild soybean and provide a theoretical basis for development and utilization of wild soybean resources.

This study aims to quantify the effects of hedgerows on the hydraulic characteristics of runoff and understand the mechanism of runoff and sediment reduction of hedgerow slopes. A field scouring-erosion experiment was conducted on a typical spoiled ground in "Changwu Agricultural Ecological Experimental Station" of the Loess Plateau in China to explore the effects of hedgerows on erosion control in slopes of disturbed soil accumulation. In experiments, 6 plots, which consisted of three hedgerow plots (H) and three control plots of bare slope (C), with a uniform size of 20 m, 5 in width, and 0.5 m height were constructed with excavated soil. By using three different flow discharges (35, 45, and 55 L/min) on the slope with three different gradients (24 degrees, 28 degrees and 32 degrees), some essential parameters, rate of sediment yield, sediment concentration of runoff, sediment reduction, shear stress, denudation rate, and runoff power, were measured for mechanism analysis. The hedgerows could delay runoff, which meant the initial runoff time of hedgerows obviously lagged behind the control plot about 1-8 min. The capability of runoff generating control by the hedgerows depended on the duration of discharge, which grew first and reduced later. At the later stage, the sediment concentration in the runoff of the hedgerow plots exceeded the control plots, which could be related to transformation of hedgerows between source and sink. The accumulated sediment yields of the hedgerow plots were reduced by 10-45% compared to the control plots. The relationship of the reduction of accumulated sediment yield and duration of discharge could be stated with quadratic function (P < 0.01), which indicated critical runoff time was advanced with increase of slope and flow discharge. Based on the runoff power, the soil erodibility parameter of the hedgerow slopes (3.58 g.N-1.m(-1)) was larger than that of the control slopes (2.83 g.N-1.m(-1)). Hedgerows could hinder soil transport, which not only reduced soil peeling, increased critical shear stress, and critical runoff power but also curbed rill evolution in the lower slope erosion process. The important parameters from this study would be helpful for optimal allocation of hedgerow measures, erosion control and erosion prediction model establishment on disturbed soil accumulation.					li, yong/HDN-3885-2022; gu, yu/GSD-4507-2022; Gu, Yucheng/GPX-1847-2022	Gu, Yucheng/0000-0002-6400-6167													0341-8162	1872-6887				OCT	2019	181								104079	10.1016/j.catena.2019.104079	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2019.104079													WOS:000477686600031

The nature and extent of climatic aberrations, perceived impact, and adaptation strategies by the farmers reduce the adverse effects of climate change on agriculture. Therefore, a study was conducted to investigate 2160 IFS farmers about their perceptions of climate change, barriers, and the likelihood of adapting to the negative impacts of climate change. The study observed an increasing rainfall trend for humid (4.18 mm/year) and semi-arid (0.35 mm/year) regions, while a decreasing trend was observed in sub-humid (-2.02 mm/year) and arid (-0.20 mm/year) regions over the last 38 years. The annual rise in temperature trends observed in different ACZs varied between 0.011-0.014 degrees C. Nearly 79% of IFS farmers perceived an increase in temperature, decreasing rainfall, variability in the onset of monsoon, heavy terminal rains, mid-season dry spells, and frequent floods due to climate change. The arid, semi-arid, sub-humid, and humid farmers' adapted several measures in different components with an adaption index of 50.2%, 66.6%, 83.3%, and 91.6%, respectively. The majority of the IFS farmers perceived constraints in adopting measures to climate change, such as meta barriers, capacity barriers, and water barriers. Therefore, we infer that educated farmers involved in diversified and profitable farms with small to medium landholdings are concerned more about climate change in undertaking adaptive strategies to reduce the environmental impact of climate change.

J	Li, XL; Fu, SH; Hu, YX; Liu, BY				Li, Xinli; Fu, Suhua; Hu, Yaxian; Liu, Baoyuan			Effects of rock fragment coverage on soil erosion: Differ among rock fragment sizes?	CATENA												The presence of rock fragments can change land cover and thus profoundly perturb soil erosion process. This study aimed to identify the effects of rock coverage on soil erosion, and how such effects were influenced by rock fragment sizes. A series of simulated rainfall experiments were applied to erosion plots with two initial soil moisture contents (dry run and wet run), under rock fragment coverage (15%, 30%, 45%, 60%) composed of eight different fragment sizes (0.7, 1.1, 3.0, 5.5, 12.0, 18.8, 26.4, 36.0 cm) from May to September in 2021. The results show that total runoff and sediment concentration increased with rock fragment size. When rock fragments with the sizes were less than 12.0 cm, the total runoff and sediment concentration were respectively 0.81-16.02% and 16.45-50.88% lower than the bare soil. Consequently, the soil loss decreased exponentially with rock fragment coverage. When rock fragment with the sizes were large than 12.0 cm, they decreased sediment concentration by 7.91-33.32% in the dry run, but increased the total runoff by 0.26-10.28% and sediment concentration by 9.33-82.91% in the wet run. As a result, the soil loss ratio firstly enhanced as rock fragment coverage up to 45% and then declined at the rock fragment coverage of 60%. Our findings demonstrate that the effects of rock fragment coverage on soil erosion are rock fragment size dependent. This can help to better parameterize the effects of rock fragment coverage in current soil erosion models, in turn providing guiding information for soil erosion control in stony regions.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				JUL	2022	214								106248	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106248	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106248		APR 2022											WOS:000798075400003

However, with the restoring of the ecosystem after grain for green, little research has been reported about the response of root traits in a long-term restored ecosystem to increased N deposition. Therefore, a successive N addition experiment was conducted in a long-term restored grassland on the Loess Plateau to analyse the effects of different N addition levels (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 g N/m2/year) on root morphological traits, soil carbon (C) and N. Our results showed that root morphological traits (except for root diameter) firstly increased and then declined, with the maximum in the N level of 5 g/m2/year. N addition significantly increased soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3 --N) with the increasing N addition level, especially in the soil surface layer. Specific root length and specific root area had remarkable negative correlations with NO3--N, while root diameter and root length density had positive correlations with soil availability N and soil microbial biomass carbon. This study indicated that plants could have the threshold response to adapt to the N addition and prefer to slowly grow rather than quickly invest and return in order to adapt to the environmental stress.					chen, zhikun/JRY-9743-2023														1214-1178	1805-9368					2021	67	9					541	547		10.17221/142/2021-PSE	http://dx.doi.org/10.17221/142/2021-PSE													WOS:000702874600006

However, it remains unclear how nitrogen (N) deposition changes the decomposition process by affecting initial substrate chemical characteristics with different fine root diameter sizes.MethodsWe compared the root decomposition processes across three diameter sizes (very fine roots, < 0.5mm; intermediate fine roots, 0.5-1.0mm; largest fine roots, 1.0-2.0mm) of Pinus tabulaeformis treated with N addition (control, low, medium, high N are 0, 3, 6, and 9gNm(-2) y(-1) respectively) for two years.Results(1) The root decomposition rates, which were mainly determined by initial N, phosphorus (P), cellulose and lignin concentrations, and carbon (C)/N and lignin/N ratios, increased with the root diameters. (2) The effect of N addition on fine root decomposition rate was not significant (P>0.05), but low N addition enhanced the correlation coefficients between initial chemical indexes and decomposition rates. (3) Low N addition increased the release rates of C and cellulose in the very fine roots but not intermediate fine and largest fine roots, while the medium and high N addition decreased the release rates of N, P, cellulose and lignin in the very fine and intermediate fine roots by affecting the initial C, N, P, starch, cellulose and lignin concentrations. (4) Release of compounds from large diameter fine roots is less responsive to N addition than that from the small ones.ConclusionsThe initial substrate chemistry plays an important role during the N addition affecting fine root decomposition and release of chemical compounds. Our results suggest that N deposition may change the biogeochemical processes of forest ecosystems by affecting the release of compounds from fine roots.

To facilitate the detection and monitoring of these phenological changes, we developed a discrete, hierarchical set of global "phenoregions" using self-organizing maps and three satellite-based vegetation indices representing multiple aspects of vegetation structure and function, including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), and vegetation optical depth (VOD). Here, we describe the distribution and phenological characteristics of these phenoregions, including their mean temperature and precipitation, differences among the three satellite indices, the number of annual growth cycles within each phenoregion and index, and recent changes in the land area of each phenoregion. We found that the phenoregions "self-organized" along two primary dimensions: degree of seasonality and peak productivity. The three satellite-based indices each appeared to provide unique information on land surface phenology, with SIF and VOD improving the ability to detect distinct annual and subannual growth cycles in some regions. Over the nine-year study period (limited in length by the short satellite SIF record), there was generally a decrease in the spatial extent of the highest productivity phenoregions, though whether due to climate or land use change remains unclear.

However, there is a lack of systematic assessment of the impact of soil water conditions on the widely reported bulk soil???xylem water isotopic offset. For this purpose, we measured 82H and 818O values of xylem water of the shrub plant Caragana korshinskii and bulk soil water, for two consecutive years at two sites with contrasting water conditions. At Site 1, with moister conditions, xylem water showed a clear isotopic de-viation towards more negative values relative to the bulk soil water values in both years (< 20% overlap), with a mean of 10.7%o for the bulk soil???xylem water line-conditioned offset (??lc-excess) and-9.1%o for the soil water line conditioned excess (SW-excess). However, xylem water was strongly matched with immobile water in the dry year. At Site 2, with drier conditions, an isotopic offset occurred in the wet year, with a 20% overlap between xylem water and bulk soil water. Mean ??lc-excess and SW-excess were 13.7%o and-11.8%o, respectively. Interestingly, the overlap reached 97% in the dry year, with the xylem water falling within the isotope space of bulk soil water. At Site 2, soil water content was positively correlated with ??lc-excess and negatively correlated with SW-excess. These results suggest that the isotopic signatures of xylem water and immobile water tend to overlap, supporting the ???two water worlds??? hypothesis. The bulk soil???xylem water isotopic offset is likely to be closely associated with the heterogeneity of soil water isotopes driven by soil water content. Our results elucidate changes in the isotopic signals of xylem water and bulk soil water under different water conditions and help better understand how plants take up water in a heterogeneous soil. <comment>Superscript/Subscript Available</comment					Wang, Li/AAE-6919-2022; 戴, 军杰/GQP-3514-2022	戴, 军杰/0000-0002-2487-084X; Zhao, Ying/0000-0001-7293-8880; wang, li/0000-0002-2697-4802													0168-1923	1873-2240				OCT 15	2022	325								109150	10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.109150	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.109150		SEP 2022											WOS:000859538300007

An additive main effect and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model and a genotype plus genotype environment interactions (GET) biplot (referred to as GGE hereafter) were used to analyze the data. The two-year test revealed that four cultivars (Zhongdi 175 (ZD175), Qiushuo 008 (Q008), Hengyu 1587 (H1587), and Yayuqingzhu 8 (Y8) exhibited high yield and good stability, whereas two cultivars (Zhongbeiqingzhu 410 (Z410) and Fangyu 36 (F36) had low yield and poor stability. The comprehensive application of the AM,MI model and the GGE biplot could accurately and intuitively evaluate the high yield, stability, and adaptability of each cultivar.

Allan; Kam, Michael			Sexual dichromatisation and sexual differences in hunting behavior and dietary intake in a free-ranging small viperid snake, <i>Cerastes vipera</i>	BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES												The tip of the tail in female Cerastes vipera, a small viperid snake, is black and conspicuous, whereas that of the male is not. We tested the hypothesis, albeit indirectly, that this sexual dimorphic chromatisation is related to caudal luring, a feeding mimicry hunting strategy. C. vipera can hunt nocturnally-active lizards only via sit-andwait ambush and, consequently, we predicted that females would use caudal luring more often than males and that the proportion of nocturnal prey items in the diet of females would be higher than in males. Our hypothesis was supported as: 1) only females demonstrated caudal luring towards nocturnally-active lizards and more than 85% did so, whereas none of the males demonstrated such behavior; and 2) females consumed a significantly higher proportion (15/40 vs 4/27) of nocturnally-active lizards than did males. We concluded that sexual dichromatisation in C. vipera is associated with hunting strategy that results in different hunting behavior and different dietary intake between sexes. These novel findings: 1) provide a functional explanation for the black tail of female C. vipera; and 2) suggest different evolutionary driving forces between sexes and, consequently, different ecological impacts of male and female C. vipera on lizard populations.

In order to study the influence of inclination angle of linear vibrating screen on buckwheat sizing effect, EDEM was used for numerical simulation of sizing process with the inclination angle of the screen separately at 2o, 3o, 4o, and 5o. By observing particle distribution on the screen deck and calculating the different types of particles in various statistical areas, qualitative comparison and quantitative analysis on the conveying capability of the screen and the penetrating capability of particles at different inclination angles were made, and the results revealed that with the increase in the inclination angle of the screen, the conveying capability of the screen was enhanced, while particles became less capable of penetrating through the sieve. When the inclination angle was increased from 2o to 3o, the conveying capability of the screen was significantly improved, while the penetrating capability of particles on both screen decks was slightly reduced. By taking the penetrating capability of particles and the conveying capability of the screen into comprehensive consideration, it turned out that better sizing effect would be achieved at the inclination angle of 3o. Our research will provide a reference for optimizing the processing parameters during the vibrating separation of buckwheat.																			2068-4215	2068-2239				JAN-APR	2023	69	1					409	416		10.35633/inmateh-69-38	http://dx.doi.org/10.35633/inmateh-69-38													WOS:000996501400028

The objectives of this study were to determine the magnitude of soil, biochar and nitrogen losses in runoff and quantify the degree of sediment enrichment with biochar and nitrogen in a soil amended with biochar. A loessial soil was amended with five rates of nitrogen-rich biochar [0, 1%, 3%, 5%, and 7% (w/w)] that had < 0.25 mm particles and incubated for 8 months. A companion study compared three biochar particle sizes ( < 0.25, 0.25-1, and 1-2 mm) applied at 3% rate. A series of simulated rainfall events (90 mm h(-1)) were applied to the soil which was held in a box at a slope of 27%. The results showed that biochar addition of 1% or 3% reduced soil loss rates while the 7% biochar addition rate increased soil loss. Biochar loss rate was proportional to the biochar addition rate when the biochar particle size was < 0.25 mm. Coarser biochar particles (1-2 mm) are retained in the soil better than the finer < 0.25 mm biochar particles. Total nitrogen loss and sediment enrichment with nitrogen and biochar were also lowest with the coarse biochar particles (1-2 mm) addition. The finer biochar particle sizes ( < 0.25 mm) were more vulnerable to erosion losses and its application caused greater total nitrogen enrichment in sediment. When finer biochar particles ( < 0.25 mm) are used, 1% biochar application leads to the best results for soils with risks of erosion but 7% biochar increased the risk of soil, biochar, and total nitrogen losses. Our study overall shows that knowledge of the pros and cons of applying biochar should be carefully considered before providing biochar application recommendations as a soil supplement on loess hillslopes.					li, yuanyuan/GZA-4435-2022	Zhang, Fengbao/0000-0003-1003-256X; Tewolde, Haile/0000-0002-8610-2619													0022-1694	1879-2707				DEC	2020	591								125318	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125318	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125318													WOS:000599757800035

Direct assimilation of measured soil water content in Root Zone Water Quality Model calibration for deficit-irrigated maize	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Correct soil water simulation is critical for water balance and plant growth in agricultural systems. Crop production simulation errors have often been attributed to a lack of accuracy in soil water content (SWC) estimates. However, only a few studies have quantified the effects of SWC estimate errors on crop production and evapotranspiration (ET), especially under different irrigation treatments. The objective of this study was to investigate the impacts of direct assimilation of measured SWC during model calibration for deficit irrigated maize (Zea mays L.) on simulated ET, leaf area index (LAI), biomass, and yield. The CERES-Maize model within the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) was calibrated using the automatic parameter estimation (PEST) software. Simulation results showed that, using PEST-optimized crop parameters, RZWQM was able to adequately predict crop yield (relative root mean squared error, rRMSE, of 4.8%) and biomass (rRMSE of 7.1%) in response to irrigation levels, in spite of the bias in SWC and ET simulation. However, with the same crop parameters but replacing simulated SWC with measured data, simulations of crop yield and biomass became worse, with higher rRMSE values (14.5% for yield and 21.5% for biomass). This unexpected model performance with SWC assimilation was mainly associated with the water addition and removal from the soil, which was improved only by recalibration of both soil and crop parameters. This study suggested compensating effects between soil and crop parameters during model calibration. Caution should be applied when using measured SWC as model inputs, especially under water stress conditions.

J	Song, ZL; Wang, J; Liu, GB; Zhang, C				Song, Zilin; Wang, Jie; Liu, Guobin; Zhang, Chao			Changes in nitrogen functional genes in soil profiles of grassland under long-term grazing prohibition in a semiarid area	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Grazing prohibition has been used to restore degraded grassland ecosystems in semiarid areas; however, the impact of this measure on soil nitrogen (N) cycling is poorly understood. Furthermore, recent studies have tended to focus on the topsoil and ignored a steep gradient of nutrient accumulation with soil depth. Here, we investigated changes in N functional genes (NFGs) involved in organic N decomposition (chiA), archaeal and bacterial ammonia oxidation (amoA-AOA and amoA-AOB), respectively, denitrification (nirK and nirS), and N fixation (nifH) in soil profiles from a chronosequence of grazing prohibition (0, 10, 15, 25, and 35 years) in the semiarid grasslands of the Loess Plateau, China. The abundance of all the investigated NFGs in grassland soils after 35 years' grazing prohibition was higher than in grazed grassland. This result suggests that microbial N turnover potential is facilitated by grazing prohibition, probably through enhanced biomass production via increases in nutrient input into the soil. The higher ratio of (chiA + nifH)/(amoA-AOA + amoA-AOB) and values of (nirK + nirS) in grazing-prohibited grasslands than in grazed grassland suggest that prohibition of grazing not only improved microbial N storage potential but also increased N gas emission potential. The abundances of NFGs varied along the soil profiles and responded differently to environmental factors. The chiA and nifH abundances decreased with soil depth and were associated with variation in aboveground biomass, NH4+-N, and organic carbon, while amoA-AOA, nirK, and nirS genes increased with depth and were more affected by soil organic carbon, moisture, and bulk density. Multivariate regression tree analysis demonstrated that aboveground biomass was the best explanatory variable for the changes in NFGs in grazed grassland, while soil organic carbon was the best in the grazing-prohibited grasslands. Our results provide new insight into the soil N cycling potential of degraded and restored semiarid grassland ecosystems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Direct measurements of FC and PWP are time consuming and expensive, and thus, it is necessary to develop related pedotransfer functions (PTFs). In this study, stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods were used to develop FC and PWP PTFs for the deep layer of the Loess Plateau based on the bulk density (BD),sand, silt, clay, and soil organic carbon (SOC) contents.Materials and methodsSoil core drilling was used to obtain undisturbed soil cores from three typical sites on the Loess Plateau, which ranged from the top of the soil profile to the bedrock (0-200m). The FC and PWP were measured using the centrifugation method at suctions of -33 and -1500kPa, respectively.Results and discussionThe results showed that FC and PWP exhibited moderate variation where the coefficients of variation were 11 and 23%, respectively. FC had significant correlations with sand, silt, clay, and SOC (P<0.01), while there were also significant correlations between all of the variables and PWP. In addition, sand was an important input variable for predicting FC, and clay and BD for predicting PWP. The performance of the SMLR and ANN approaches was similar.ConclusionsIn this study, we developed new PTFs for FC and PWP as the first set of PTFs based on data obtained from deep profiles in the Loess Plateau. These PTFs are important for evaluating the soil water conditions in the deep profile in this region.																			1439-0108	1614-7480				JAN	2019	19	1					140	147		10.1007/s11368-018-2036-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-018-2036-x													WOS:000456207800014

A field experiment was conducted with blackgram in spring-summer seasons during 2020 and 2021 in Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, West Bengal with two sowing dates in March in main plot, two soil applications of Co at 4 kg/ha in sub-plot and five foliar spray levels of 1.25% K and 0.2% B in sub-sub plot in a split-split plot design to explore the effects of Co, K and B in improving growth, physiology, production, quality and production economics of the crop. Pooled analysis indicated that March first week sowing as well as soil application of Co and foliar K+B fortifications separately achieved significantly higher (P=0.05) plant height, dry matter accumulation, root nodulation, branches/plant, pods/plant, seeds/pod, test weight, total chlorophyll and nitrate reductase contents, net photosynthetic rate, physiological efficiency, yield, seed nutrients and protein contents, economic returns and benefit-cost ratio. Seed protein content was a linear function of root nodule numbers explaining about 84.05% variation.

Spatial and temporal turnover of parasite species and parasite-host interactions: a case study with fleas and gamasid mites parasitic on small mammals	PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH												We studied patterns of ectoparasite species turnover and pairwise ectoparasite-host interactions across space and time in fleas and mites harboured by small mammals using a novel metric, zeta diversity (similarity between multiple communities). We asked whether the zeta diversity of parasites and their interactions with hosts follow a similar spatial or temporal trend. We found substantial differences in some (zeta decline and retention rate) but not in other (zeta decay) spatial patterns of zeta diversity between species and interactions, whereas the differences between the patterns of the temporal species versus interaction zeta diversity occurred to a much lesser extent. In particular, the parametric form of zeta decline suggested that the distribution of ectoparasite species across localities is driven mainly by niche-based processes, whereas the spatial distribution of flea-host and mite-host interactions is predominantly stochastic. We also found much stronger variation in the number of shared species and interactions over space than over time. Parasite community composition, in terms of species, appeared to be much more temporally stable than that in terms of parasite-host interactions. The parametric form of temporal zeta decline indicated that both parasite communities and parasite-host networks are assembled over time via niche-based processes.

J	Bussa, B; Behera, U				Bussa, Bhargavi; Behera, Umakanta			Food, nutrition and energy security of small and marginal farmers through integrated agriculture	CURRENT SCIENCE												Food security and environmental sustainability are threatened by the degradation of natural resources in India's rice-based agricultural systems. On-farm and on-station experiments on the integrated farming system (IFS) were carried out at ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, to develop a productive, profitable and long-term resource-conserving alternative agricultural system that secures the food, nutrition and energy requirements of small farmers. IFS helped in making the farming system sustainable through different cropping, biodiversity and ecosystem services. It provided food and nutrition security to the farmer family through the production of diversified food commodities such as cereal, pulses, oilseeds, vegetables, fruits, eggs, milk, fish, meat, etc. Dairy-biogas integration offered a promising win-win opportunity to improve crop production while, at the same time, meeting the fuel needs of the farmer families. Field application of slurry reduced fertilizer burden on the farmers, besides improving the sustainability of their fields. Ecosystem services such as pollination of crops, run-off water harvesting, prevention of soil erosion, carbon sequestration by plants and soil, cultural services, etc. are vital for the sustainable supply of food and fibre. The experiment was conducted for three consecutive years (2015-18), and was observed that the IFS model generated net returns of INR 378,784 and employment of 628 mandays which are more than the conventional rice-wheat system.

Adaptation to a novel host and performance trade-off in host-generalist and host-specific insect ectoparasites	INSECT SCIENCE												We investigated the performance trade-offs of fleas (Siphonaptera) while adapting to a novel host using two host generalists (Xenopsylla conformis and Xenopsylla ramesis) and one host specialist (Parapulex chephrenis) maintained on their principal hosts (Meriones crassus for Xenopsylla and Acomys cahirinus for P. chephrenis). We asked whether, over generations, (i) a host generalist may become a specialist by evolving the ability to exploit a novel host and losing the ability to exploit an original host and (ii) a host specialist can become a generalist by evolving the ability to exploit a novel host without losing the ability to exploit an original host. We established an experimental line of each species on a novel host (Acomys russatus for Xenopsylla and M. crassus for P. chephrenis) and maintained this line on this host during 23 generations. We compared reproductive performance of progenitors of each line and their descendants when they exploited either original or novel host in terms of egg number and size, hatching success, offspring production, and offspring size. We found changes in performance over generations in female offspring size only. Xenopsylla conformis demonstrated a tendency to become a host specialist (increased performance on the novel host with a concomitant decreased performance on the original host), whereas P. chephrenis demonstrated a tendency to become a host generalist (increased performance on the novel host without a concomitant decreased performance on the original host). We conclude that the probability of generalist to specialist transition, and vice versa, is context-dependent and varies between species.

It is important to develop a sensing system for planters capable of measuring the sowing rate of various kinds of seeds with the same settlement. For this purpose, an infrared sensing system was developed comprised of IR LEDs and photo-diodes on the opposite sides. When a seed stream passes, the output voltage of the light-receiving sensor changes proportionally in response to changing in the intensity of light at the receiving element. The voltage changes were added using a microcontroller and converted to an analog value by DAC chip. The test apparatus was designed to calibrate and evaluate the sensor with three types of seeds of chickpea, wheat, and alfalfa. These seeds respectively represent the large, medium and the fine seeds. The results revealed a good correlation between the voltage received from the seed sensor and the mass flow of seeds in the delivery tube. A model was developed for seed flow rate based on sensor output voltages, thousand seed weight and equivalent diameter of seeds. The coefficient of determination for the model was 0.94. So, it was concluded that the seed flow rate could be estimated based on some physical properties and output sensor voltage. The developed infrared sensing system could be used for the assessment of planter rows performance in the laboratory. It could provide an easy calibrating method for seed drills before planting in the field.

In the proposed monitoring system, seed flow sensors were installed individually on each seed tube so that the seed flow rate, as well as the presence or absence of seed flow, could be displayed on a graphical interface. The ground speed was measured with the Hall Effect sensor, and taking into account the mass flow rate of the seed, the sowing rate was calculated according to the seed mass sown per unit area. During operation, the system registered sowing data with the location information provided by the GPS module. The overall information from the sowing performance was then recorded on the embedded memory card and simultaneously displayed on the graphical interface. The proposed system was also provided with ultrasonic sensors to continuously measure and display the seed and fertilizer levels in the hoppers. The monitoring system was constructed and installed on a seed drill equipped with 13 sowing units. With three levels of ground speed and sowing rate during field experiments, the sensing system was assessed under outdoor operating conditions. The field test resulted in a correlation coefficient of 85% between the mean of the weighted data obtained from the scale and the mass flow estimates. The obstruction of the optical elements by dust seems to have had the most adverse effect on the performance of the proposed sensing system.

Some attempts in using limited amounts of mineral fertilisers only brought small improvements in soil fertility and yield of the crop. Hence, to evaluate the response of haricot bean to integrated use of phosphorus and manure, an experiment was conducted with three replications of a randomised block design comprising the nine treatment combinations of three levels of P (0, 50 and 100 kg triple super phosphate (TSP) ha(-1)) and three levels of manure (0, 5 and 7.5 t ha(-1)). All the collected agronomic data were subjected to ANOVA using Genstat 18th Edition software. Results showed that the highest number of pods per plant (38.13) was recorded from the main effect of 100 kg TSP compared to the lowest (30.40) for the control. The highest effective number of nodules (221.1) was recorded from the main effect of 100 kg TSP. The highest harvest index (0.56) was recorded when 0 t manure ha(-1) was applied. Simple correlation analysis confirmed that grain yield was correlated with total number of nodules, effective number of nodules and number of pods per plant. The results showed that use of 100 kg TSP with 5.0 t manure ha(-1) gave the highest grain yield (3.40 t ha(-1) vs 1.95 t ha(-1) control). Increasing manure to 7.5 t ha(-1) gave the highest dry matter yield (7.2 t ha(-1)vs 3.5 t ha(-1) control). The integrated use of 50 kg TSP with 7.5 t manure ha(-1) was found beneficial for haricot bean producers in the study area. Combined applications of TSP and manure doubled haricot bean yield at Mechara area in Darolebu district of the eastern Ethiopian highlands.

J	Qiao, JB; Zhu, YJ; Jia, XX; Shao, MA				Qiao, Jiangbo; Zhu, Yuanjun; Jia, Xiaoxu; Shao, Ming'an			Multifractal characteristics of particle size distributions (50-200 m) in soils in the vadose zone on the Loess Plateau, China	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												The soil particle size distribution (PSD) is an important and basic physical property that determines many other chemical, physical, and biological properties of soil. Thus, quantitatively characterizing the soil PSD is important. However, the PSDs have not been characterized previously in deep soil profiles on the Loess Plateau, China. Therefore, in the present study, we employed single fractal theory and multifractal theory to quantitatively characterize these PSDs. Soil samples (50-200 m) were collected from the top of the soil profile down to the bedrock by drilling at five sites on the Loess Plateau in China. The results showed that the sand content had the highest coefficient of variation (CV) whereas the silt content had the lowest CV. Single fractal dimension (D) analysis detected significant positive relationships between D and the silt and clay contents, but a significant negative relationship with the sand content. Multifractal analysis indicated that the capacity dimension (D-0) values at five sites tended to increase from south to north, whereas a decreasing trend was determined for the information dimension/capacity dimension (D-1/D-0). Yangling had the lowest Delta a and Delta D values, whereas Ansai had the highest. The Delta f values were highest at Ansai and Shenmu. Our results are important to understand the soil physical properties and to estimate the soil hydraulic properties in deep profiles on the Loess Plateau.																			0167-1987	1879-3444				JAN	2021	205								104786	10.1016/j.still.2020.104786	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2020.104786													WOS:000582696400031

To evaluate the effects of Na2S on the growth of Robinia pseudoacacia (black locust), heavy metal immobilization, and soil microbial activity, the R. pseudoacacia biomass and nutrient content and the soil heavy metal bioavailability, enzyme activity, and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal community were measured by a single-factor pot experiment. The Pb-Zn-contaminated soil was collected from a Pb-Zn mine that had been remediated by R. pseudoacacia for five years. Three pollution levels (unpolluted, mildly polluted, and severely polluted) were evaluated by the pollution load index. Na2S application increased the shoot biomass under severe and mild contamination. In soil, Na2S application decreased the bioavailable Pb and Zn contents under severe and mild contamination, which resulted in a decrease in the Pb and Zn content in R. pseudoacacia. However, Na2S application did not affect the total Pb content per plant and enhanced the total Zn content per plant because of the higher biomass of the plants under Na2S application. Increased phosphatase activity and increased available phosphorous content may promote the uptake of phosphorus in R. pseudoacacia. Moreover, Na2S application is beneficial to the diversity of AM fungi under mild and severe pollution. Overall, Na2S application has great potential for enhancing soil heavy metal immobilization, enhancing soil microbial activity, and improving the growth of R. pseudoacacia in polluted soils. Therefore, Na2S is suitable for use in Pb-Zn remediation to ameliorate environmental heavy metal pollution.					ren, wei/IUP-5680-2023	ren, wei/0000-0001-7566-2648; Tang, Ming/0000-0002-8158-6300													0147-6513	1090-2414				JUL 1	2020	197								110563	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.110563	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.110563								32278824					WOS:000531094000023
J	Shen, HO; Zheng, FL; Wang, L; Wen, LL				Shen Hai-ou; Zheng Fen-li; Wang Lei; Wen Lei-lei			Effects of rainfall intensity and topography on rill development and rill characteristics on loessial hillslopes in China	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												Rill development is a major soil erosion process that causes severe soil degradation. This study examined the effects of representative rainfall intensities (50 and 75 mm h-1), slope gradients (10 degrees and 15 degrees), and slope lengths (7.5 and 10.0 m) on rill development and rill characteristics on loessial hillslopes in China. Loessial soil was collected from the cropland of Ansai Town, Yan'an City, Shaanxi Province. The soil with 28.3% sand, 58.1% silt, and 13.6% clay was packed into a soil pan to conduct rainfall simulations in 2012. The results showed that the time of the knickpoint occurrence (5-16 min), the rill headcut extension (9-33 min), and the mean headward erosion rate (1.7-5.0 cm min-1) were better representative indicators for reflecting the changes in the rill development than other indicators used in this study. For a quick evaluation of the rill erosion severity, the rill coverage ratio (1%-12%, generally increasing with an increase in the rainfall intensity) was better than the other indicators for treatments with different rainfall intensities, and the rill width-depth ratio (1.56-2.27, generally decreasing with an increase in the slope gradient) was better than the other indicators for treatments with different slope gradients. Furthermore, the rill inclination angle (8.2 degrees-19.1 degrees, significantly increasing with an increase in the slope length) and rill density (0.19-1.34 m center dot m-2, generally increasing with an increase in the slope length) were more suitable for evaluating the rill erosion severity on hillslopes with different slope lengths. Therefore, the representative indicators could reflect the differences in the rill development and rill characteristics under different rainfall and topographic situations. The study greatly improved the evaluation of rill erosion severity and the prediction of the development of rills for loessial hillslopes.

The mean seasonal rainfall was 796 mm, received in 38 rainy days. The seasonal rainfall indicated that there is 53% chance of receiving less than 700 mm with variable intensities and 36% chance of getting more than normal rainfall and 11% chance of seasonal rainfall, in between 700 mm to 800 mm. The mean weekly rainfall during crop season was 45.8 mm with a CV of 116%. Highest mean weekly rainfall was recorded 71.8 mm with SD (95.3) and CV (132.7%) in 30th MW. Sowing of Kharif crops should be undertaken during 24th MW to 27th MW. Significant and positive correlation between yield and rainfall was observed for Soybean, Pigeonpea, Black gram, Green gram and rice. The predictability of productivity of crops using seasonal rainfall is 10-20% variation in productivity for all the crops at the Centre. The El Nino episode was negatively influencing Southwest monsoon and annual rainfall as well as rainfall during the months of July and September. El Nino episodes exhibit more negative influence on productivity of all the crops except rice crop. Among the different categories of El Nino, weak events exerted more negative impact on productivity of short duration crops (i.e., sorghum, soybean and Black gram) as compared to moderate and strong El Nino events.																			0252-9416					APR	2020	71	2					285	290																WOS:000538384900010
J	Yang, X; Li, TC; Shao, M				Yang, Xi; Li, Tongchuan; Shao, Ming'an			Factors controlling deep-profile soil organic carbon and water storage following <i>Robinia pseudoacacia</i> afforestation of the Loess Plateau in China	FOREST ECOSYSTEMS												Background: Afforestation is a common and effective approach used for the restoration of degraded ecosystems worldwide. In China, Robinia pseudoacacia (RP) is among the main non-native tree species and has been widely planted in revegetation of the Loess Plateau. However, owing to uncertainties regarding soil water consumption and carbon sequestration, it is necessary to assess the suitability and sustainability of R. pseudoacacia in restoration. In this study, we aimed to analyse the dynamic effects of R. pseudoacacia forest on soil carbon storage (SCS) and soil water storage (SWS). Specifically, we investigated the association between soil water content (SWC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) and underlying factors in the 0-500-cm profile of a 10- to 50-year-old chronosequence. Results: The results obtained indicated that the dynamics of SWS and SCS on this time scale could be divided into an initial reduction phase (the initial 20 years after afforestation) and subsequent recovery (20-50 years after afforestation). Compared with in the abandoned land (AL), the net accumulation of SCS in R. pseudoacacia forest was 2.51 Mg-ha(-1) at 50 years after afforestation, whereas there was a 398.76-mm deficit in SWS. Additionally, the natural succession of R. pseudoacacia forest has contributed to the continuous change in stand structure (e.g. vegetation cover (VC), understory vegetation coverage (UVC), and litter biomass (LB)). Conclusions: These findings indicate that vegetation restoration increases carbon sequestration while causing soil water deficit. Furthermore, stand density (SD) was established to make a predominant contribution to the dynamics of SWS and SCS via its effects in altering vegetation, soil, and litter characteristics. Therefore, high-density plantation forests in the Loess Plateau area should be appropriately thinned to reduce the density of forest stands on the basis of soil erosion control and wind and sand fixation, so as to increase carbon sink with lower water consumption, thus realizing the synergistic development of soil carbon sequestration and water connotation.																			2095-6355	2197-5620					2022	9								100079	10.1016/j.fecs.2022.100079	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fecs.2022.100079													WOS:000899688300001

Sarcocornia fruticosa (ecotypes EL and VM) is currently cultivated, but there is demand for new crop candidates and higher biomass production. Salicornia brachiata Roxb. and Arthrocneum macrostachyum L. are considered novel crops, and to realize their potential, their response to salinity and nitrogen nutrition was compared to S. fruticosa ecotypes. Experiments revealed that higher N supplemented with lower NaCl significantly increased fresh and dry shoot biomass. Lower biomass was obtained at lower nitrogen supplemented with elevated NaCl, whereas total soluble solids content positively correlated with NaCl fertigation in both Sarcocornia ecotypes. Protein content increased with a lower nitrogen supply. Anthocyanins and oxygen radical absorbance capacity were highest in S. fruticosa EL and A. macrostachyum at higher NaCl supply. The results show that halophytes have a variety of strategies to cope with high NaCl, even between ecotypes of the same species. Notably, repetitive harvesting of S. brachiata delayed flowering enabling year-round biomass production. Additionally, S. brachiata accumulated higher biomass than Sarcocornia VM when grown in a greenhouse at higher radiation than in a growth room and strongly supports its inclusion as a cash-crop halophyte.

J	Li, XT; Zhang, FB; Yang, JY; Yang, MY				Li, Xuantian; Zhang, Fengbao; Yang, Jiayan; Yang, Mingyi			The response of organic carbon fractions in sediment to rainfall characteristics and slope lengths: Based on four-years on-site monitoring data	CATENA												The effect of soil erosion processes on the properties of sediment and organic carbon fractions is not well understood under complex erosion environments, such as various rainfall characteristics and transport distances, which leads to a gap in knowledge regarding the role of soil erosion in the global carbon cycle. This study investigated the impact of different rainfall characteristics (patterns and parameters) and slope lengths (5 m similar to 20 m) on the sediment yield, particle size distribution (PSD) and properties of organic carbon fractions on China's Loess Plateau. The results show that runoff was highest under rainfall pattern A (extreme rainfall), while the sediment concentration peaked under rainfall pattern B (heavy rainfall), with significant correlation with slope length, rainfall intensity, kinetic energy, rainfall erosivity and precipitation (p less than 0.05). Silt-and clay-sized fractions were transported as primary particles and enriched under rainfall patterns B and C with no differences between slope lengths. The enrichment ratio (ER) of sediment, effective and ultimate particles were primarily influenced by rainfall intensity-related parameters. In contrast, the aggregation ratio (AR) tended to be influenced by rainfall kinetic energy. The content and loss of organic carbon fractions correlated to rainfall parameters and slope length, although no significant difference was observed between different rainfall patterns and slope lengths. Lost organic carbon fractions were predominantly Mineral-associated organic carbon (MOC), with great enrichment under rainfall pattern C and rapid depletion as the slope length increased. Structural equation models (SEM) indicated the effect of rainfall characteristics and slope length on organic carbon loss was mainly due to the regulation of soil loss and particle size distribution of sediment in selective transport erosion processes. We highlighted the need to consider the effect of soil erosion and particle size distribution comprehensively on the carbon cycle from the perspective of organic carbon fractions to describe the potential effects of soil erosion on the carbon budget quantitatively, especially in complex environmental conditions with consideration of scale effect.

South Africa's agricultural dust sources and events from MSG SEVIRI	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												Geomorphological dust research in Southern African has focused on natural sources in Namibia and Botswana. Here we aim to identify South Africa's dust sources using the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-red Imager data (SEVIRI) between 2006 to 2016. A total of 334,497 images identified 178 dust plumes on 75 dust days, which originate mostly from the Free State, between June to January. Source areas consist of commercial agriculture, grass and shrublands. Half of all event days in the record occurred between 2015 and 2016, a severe drought, according to the Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index. Crop statistics report a decline in maize cover from 1.2 to 0.6 million hectares and a pronounced increase in fallow cover, confirmed by a below average Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Transport-capacity appears to be enhanced during drought years and on the increase in wind records. All dust event days adhere to a diurnal wind pattern, irrespective of synoptic conditions and most trajectories head towards the Indian Ocean. In terms of both frequency and extend, SEVIRI events are minor when compared to the northern hemisphere. However South Africa's major dust sources differ in that they appear to be mostly associated with anthropogenic activities especially rainfed agriculture. The emission potential from natural surfaces remains to be examined. Fire however is not a common precursor in dusty years. The widespread Luvisols and Arenosols, are rich in silt and sand, extend into the wider interior, including the Kalahari, where future climate scenarios by others have predicted increases in dust emissions.					von Holdt, Johanna/J-6587-2019; Eckardt, Frank D/N-3682-2015; Jack, Christopher/B-7926-2014	von Holdt, Johanna/0000-0003-1303-6208; Eckardt, Frank D/0000-0003-0200-7110; Jack, Christopher/0000-0002-0936-7277; Murray, Jonathan/0000-0002-5400-5128													1875-9637	2212-1684				DEC	2020	47								100637	10.1016/j.aeolia.2020.100637	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aeolia.2020.100637													WOS:000582628400005

The contribution of a coffee-based agroforestry system to tree diversity and carbon stock along altitudinal gradients in Western Ethiopia was assessed. At 500-m intervals, six transect lines were methodically set up throughout the altitudinal gradient. There were made a total of 60 sample plots, each measuring 40 m by 40 m. A total of 34 woody species were identified. Biomass carbon stocks and tree diversity were quantified across altitudinal gradients. In the middle altitude, there were more woody species (28) than in the top altitude, where there were only a few species (16). The tree plants stored around 40.6 t ha(-1) of biomass carbon on average. Aboveground biomass had a carbon stock of 32.22 C t ha(-1), whereas belowground biomass had a carbon stock of 8.38 C t ha(-1). The lower altitude biomass carbon stocks were substantially bigger than the upper altitude, which were 48.4 C t ha(-1) and 25.67 C t ha(-1), respectively. With increasing altitude, the study found a statistically significant negative link between tree diversity and biomass carbon storage (P < 0.05). The negative link between biomass carbon stock and altitude was that tree parameters that determine the amount of biomass carbon sequestered in a plant, such as basal area, tree diversity, and density, decreased as altitude increased. Despite differences along altitudinal gradients, the systems supported a diverse range of tree species and biomass carbon stocks.

A two-year field experiment was conducted to determine the effects of manure and plastic mulching on the fate of (15) N-labelled urea. Urea was applied at the same rate to spring maize (Zea mays L.) growing in soils under three different treatments (no film mulching + mineral fertilizer, CK; film mulching + mineral fertilizer, FN; and film mulching + mineral fertilizer + cow manure, FNM) in 2018 and 2019, but (15) N-labelled urea was applied in 2018 only. FN and FNM increased the maize grain yields for both years. FN increased the total N uptake in the aboveground biomass by 20% in 2018, whereas no significant difference in (15) N uptake was observed in 2018 compared with that of the CK. The residual (15) N in the 0-1 m soil layer fell within a range of 8-20% two years later and was mostly retained in the top 0.2 m. FN and FNM significantly increased the total N uptake after two years, while the opposite trend was observed for potential N loss. The decreases in potential loss were 6% under FN and 39% under FNM. Therefore, our results indicate that plastic film mulching combined with manure application could not only increase maize grain yields and N uptake but also reduce the loss of fertilizer N, affecting the fate of urea-N in maize production.

Desalination, Water Re-use, and Halophyte Cultivation in Salinized Regions: A Highly Productive Groundwater Treatment System	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Anovel RO-FO-halophyte cultivation systemmaximises water utilisation efficiency by providing groundwater desalination,wastewater treatment, and ZLD. Groundwater salinization is a problemaffecting access to waterin many world regions. Though desalination by conventional reverseosmosis (RO) can upgrade groundwater quality for drinking, its disadvantagesinclude unmanaged brine discharge and accelerated groundwater depletion.Here, we propose a new approach combining RO, forward osmosis (FO),and halophyte cultivation, in which FO optimally adjusts the concentrationof the RO reject brine for irrigation of Salicornia or Sarcocornia. The FO also re-useswastewater, thus, reducing groundwater extraction and the wastewatereffluent volume. To suit different groundwater salinities in the range1-8 g/L, three practical designs are proposed and analyzed.Results include specific groundwater consumption (SGC), specific energyconsumption (SEC), wastewater volume reduction, peak RO pressure,permeate water quality, efficiency of water resource utilization,and halophyte yield. Compared to conventional brackish water RO, theresults show superior performance in almost all aspects. For example,SGC is reduced from 1.25 to 0.9 m(3) per m(3) ofdrinking water output and SEC is reduced from 0.79 to 0.70 kW h/m(3) by a FO-RO-FO system treating groundwater ofsalinity 8 g/L. This system can produce 1.1 m(3) of high-qualitydrinking water and up to 4.9 kg of edible halophyte per m(3) of groundwater withdrawn.

GENOTYPES BASED ON AMMI MODEL	BANGLADESH JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Stability and adaptability of promising maize hybrids in terms of three agronomic traits (grain yield, ear weight and 100-kernel weight) in multi-environments trials were evaluated. The analysis of AMMI model indicated that the all three agronomic traits showed highly significant differences (p < 0.01) on genotype, environment and genotype by environment interaction. Results showed that genotypes Hengyu321 (G9), Yufeng303 (G10) and Huanong138 (G3) were of higher stability on grain yield, ear weight and 100-kernel weight, respectively. Genotypes Hengyu1587 (G8) and Hengyu321 (G9) showed good performance in terms of grain yield, whereas Longping208 (G2) and Weike966 (G12) showed broad adaptability for ear weight. It was also found that the genotypes with better adaptability in terms of 100-kernel weight were Zhengdan958 (G5) and Weike966 (G12). The genotype and environment interaction model based on AMMI analysis indicated that Hengyu1587 and Hengyu321 were the ideal genotypes, due to extensive adaptability and high grain yield under both testing sites.					liu, bb/GXA-2527-2022; chen, zhaoyang/GRS-1470-2022														0253-5416	2079-9926				JUN	2021	50	2					343	350		10.3329/bjb.v50i2.54091	http://dx.doi.org/10.3329/bjb.v50i2.54091													WOS:000729256600018

Clarifying whether the effects of legumes on N cycling vary with contrasting ecosystem types and climatic regions is crucial for understanding and predicting ecosystem processes, but these effects are currently unknown. By conducting a global meta-analysis, we revealed that legumes increased the soil net N mineralization rate (R-min) by 67%, which was greater than the recently reported increase associated with N deposition (25%). This effect was similar for tropical (53%) and temperate regions (81%) but was significantly greater in grasslands (151%) and forests (74%) than in croplands (-3%) and was greater in in situ incubation (101%) or short-term experiments (112%) than in laboratory incubation (55%) or long-term experiments (37%). Legumes significantly influenced the dependence of R-min on N fertilization and experimental factors. The R-min was significantly increased by N fertilization in the nonlegume soils, but not in the legume soils. In addition, the effects of mean annual temperature, soil nutrients and experimental duration on R-min were smaller in the legume soils than in the nonlegume soils. Collectively, our results highlighted the significant positive effects of legumes on soil N cycling, and indicated that the effects of legumes should be elucidated when addressing the response of soils to plants.

We found that the soil enzyme activities and microbial necromass C were 45-646% higher in rhizosphere soils than bulk soils regardless of the season and halophyte functional group. The activities of soil enzymes and bacterial necromass C were highest for forbs (4.9-172.3 nmol g-1 h-1 and 473.2 mg kg-1, respectively), and grasses had the highest fungal necromass C (FN-C) and total necromass C/soil organic C (TN-C/SOC) ratio. Moreover, the soil enzyme activities were higher in the late season stage (4.0-154.0 nmol g-1 h-1) than the early (3.6-132.1 nmol g-1 h-1) and middle (3.8-128.9 nmol g-1 h-1) season stages. FN-C and TN-C/SOC ratio were significantly higher in the middle season than the early and late seasons. Redundancy analysis showed that the enzyme activities and microbial necromass C mainly depended on the soil physicochemical properties, season, and halophyte functional group. Our results indicate that microbial turnover was consistently faster in rhizosphere soil than bulk soil in an inland saline ecosystem, and forbs could be used as pioneer species to improve microbial turnover during the phytoremediation of saline ecosystems.																			0178-2762	1432-0789				NOV	2023	59	8					989	1003		10.1007/s00374-023-01768-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-023-01768-8		SEP 2023											WOS:001070376800001

The adsorption capacity is 598 mg/g, which is three times higher than that of the adsorbent with microporous structure. The rich mesoporous structure of the adsorbent provides adsorption channels and filling sites, and pi-pi attraction, cation-pi interaction, hydrogen bonds, and electrostatic attraction provide adsorption forces at the adsorption sites. The removal rate of OTC exceeds 98 % over a wide range of pH values (3-10). It has high selectivity for competing cations in water, with higher than 86.7 % removal rate of OTC from medical waste-water. After 7 consecutive adsorption-desorption cycles, the removal rate of OTC remains as high as 91 %. This efficient removal rate and excellent reusability indicate the strong potential of the adsorbent for industrial ap-plications. This study prepares a highly efficient, environmentally friendly antibiotic adsorbent that can not only efficiently remove antibiotics from water but also recycle industrial alkali lignin waste.

Recent shifts in plant diversity in rangelands due to increased grazing pressure and climate changes have the potential to impact the sequestration of carbon in arid to semi-humid regions worldwide. However, plant diversity, grazing intensity and carbon storage are also influenced by environmental factors such as nutrient availability, climate and topography. The complexity of these interactions limits our ability to fully assess the impacts of grazing on biodiversity-ecosystem function (BEF) relationships. We assessed how grazing intensity modifies BEF relationships by determining the links between plant diversity and ecosystem carbon stocks (plant and soil carbon) across broad environmental gradients and different plant growth forms. To achieve this, we surveyed 1493 quadrats across 10 rangelands, covering an area of 23,756 ha in northern Iran. We show that above-ground carbon stocks increased with plant diversity across topographic, climatic and soil fertility gradients. The relationship between above-ground carbon stocks and plant diversity was strongest for forbs, followed by shrubs and grasses. Soil carbon stocks increased strongly with soil fertility across sites, but aridity, grazing, plant diversity and topography were also important in explaining variation in soil carbon stocks. Importantly, above-ground and soil carbon stocks declined at high grazing intensity, and grazing modified the relationship between plant diversity and carbon stocks regardless of differences in abiotic conditions across sites. Our study demonstrates that relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem carbon stocks persist across gradients of aridity, topography and soil fertility, but the relationships are modified by grazing intensity. Our findings suggest that potential losses in plant diversity under grazing intensification could reduce ecosystem carbon storage across wide areas of arid to semi-humid rangelands. We discuss the potential mechanisms underpinning rangeland BEF relationships to stimulate future research. Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

Latrine Structure, Design, and Conditions, and the Practice of Open Defecation in Lodwar Town, Turkana County, Kenya: A Quantitative Methods Research	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH INSIGHTS												Background: Poor latrine conditions, structure, and design may deter latrine use and provoke reversion to open defecation (OD). Statistics show that only 18% of the households in Turkana County, Kenya, have access to a latrine facility with most of these facilities in poor structural designs and poor hygienic conditions, which encourages rampant OD practices. Aim: This article reports on quantitative aspects of a larger cross-sectional survey to assess latrine structure, design, and conditions, and the practice of OD in Lodwar. Methods: An observational study was carried out to examine latrine conditions, structure, and design in Lodwar, Kenya. A standardized questionnaire was also used to collect quantitative data. Stratified random sampling technique was employed to select respondents for this study with the sample drawn from 4 administrative units of Lodwar town covering the low-, medium-, and high-income households. Data were managed using Statistical Packages for Social Science (SPSS) software. Results: Nineteen percent of the sampled households did not possess a latrine facility at their homesteads with 73% of the latrines constructed using poor materials (mud, mats, polythene bags, and grass). Twenty percent of the respondents were scared of using a latrine with the main reason being loose soils that do not support strong constructions. Eighty-seven percent of the respondents agreed that the presence of feces on the latrine floor encouraged the practice of OD and 321 (80%) respondents stated that the latrine construction materials influenced latrine ownership and its subsequent use. Conclusions: Respondents attributed rampant OD practices to poor latrine structure, design, and conditions. In addition, rampant cases of latrine sharing result in latrine filthiness, which eventually encourages OD practice. Inequality in sanitation, among counties, should be addressed in Kenya. The government should take charge of provision of good-quality communal latrines to the less-privileged societies like Turkana. Community empowerment and introduction of a small fee for cleaning and maintenance of these facilities will also improve their conditions.

Nematodes are the most abundant animals in soil and play a vital role in maintaining soil biodiversity and functions. Exploring the ecological processes that drive soil nematode diversity and community assembly during secondary succession can help to gain a predictive and mechanistic understanding of soil biodiversity maintenance and ecosystem recovery. In this study, based on the investigation of soil nematode community composition and structure, we examined the changes in nematode alpha-and beta-diversity along forest secondary succession and disentangled the contributions of different community assembly processes (deter-ministic and stochastic processes) in each successional stage on the Loess Plateau, a key region of ecological restoration in China. The results showed that: (1) Abundances of plant-parasitic and bacterial-feeding nematodes were lower in the pioneer and climax forest stages than in the grassland and shrub stages. Meanwhile, nematode community composition considerably changed, with the dominant trophic group changing from plant-parasitic (grassland stage: 35.48%) and bacterial-feeding (shrub stage: 35.63%) to fungal-feeding (pioneer and climax forest stages: 30.65-36.44%). These changes might be associated with higher carbon-to-nitrogen ratios of fine roots and litters, as well as higher litter phosphorus content (LTP), in pioneer and climax forests; (2) Nematode alpha-diversity and beta-diversity peaked in the shrub stage and decreased substantially in the climax forest stage, but beta-diversity differed more significantly between successional stages than alpha-diversity. Fine root biomass, root carbon to nitrogen ratio, and litter phosphorus content were the main predictors of nematode alpha-and beta-diversity, while geographic distance positively affected nematode beta-diversity; (3) In the grassland and climax forest stages, deterministic processes dominated nematode community assembly, probably due to the strong influence of environmental factors such as the quantity or quality of plant resources. Especially, in the climax forest stage, the low quality of plant resources might be responsible for the low nematode diversity and network complexity. In the shrub and pioneer forest stages, the contribution of stochastic processes gradually increased, and nematode networks became more complex. Taken together, our results emphasize the importance of litter and root quality in regulating nematode diversity and community assembly, especially in the late successional stage, which provides insights into forest restoration and sustainable management in the Loess Plateau and other similar arid and semiarid regions.																			0378-1127	1872-7042				FEB 1	2023	529								120734	10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120734	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120734		DEC 2022											WOS:000908782000001

SYNERGISTIC EFFECT OF FERTILIZATION ON INTERANNUAL VARIATION OF SOIL CARBON AND NITROGEN CONTENTS AND SOYBEAN YIELD IN SEMIARID SOIL	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The effects of long-term fertilization on soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and soybean yield stability were studied in semiarid areas of China for optimizing soil fertilization and obtaining stable and efficient soybean yield. SOC, TN, and soybean yields in different soil layers were measured after performing nine fertilization treatments for 5 consecutive years. The results showed that CK treatment (1,264.2 kg center dot hm-2) was significantly lower than other treatments. Under the combination of organic and inorganic treatments, the interannual variation of soybean yield under treatment with organic fertilizer combined with nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer was smaller, while the stability and sustainability indices were higher. The organic carbon and TN contents in surface soil (0-20 cm) showed an increasing trend with different fertilization. There was a significant positive linear correlation between SOC and TN contents in topsoil (0-20 cm) (P < 0.01; correlation coefficient = 0.947**). The yield of soybean increased with the increase of SOC and TN contents in topsoil (0-20 cm), with a significant positive correlation between them (P < 0.05). The yield of soybean increased with the increase of SOC and TN contents in surface soil (20-40 cm), although no significant positive correlation between SOC and TN contents was observed.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2023	21	2					1293	1311		10.15666/aeer/2102_12931311	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/2102_12931311		JAN 2023											WOS:000962283900001

Most enhanced adsorption methods employ chemical modification, and there are few reports on physical activation. We present a physical activation to explore whether physical ultrasound may enhance the adsorption performance and comprehensive utilisation of a new forestry waste, Caragana korshinskii was used as a feedstock to prepare activated biochar (ACB) by controlling the pyrolysis temperatures and ultrasound parameters. The optimal parameters were determined via batch adsorption of NH4+, and the adsorption characteristics were assessed by 8 kinds of models and influence experiments. Moreover, the physicochemical properties of ACB during the pyrolysis process were investigated, and the ultrasonic activation and adsorption mechanisms were discussed using multiple characterisation techniques. Additionally, the cost analysis, the safety of the ultrasonic process and disposal method also were evaluated. The results showed that the ultrasonic activation significantly enhanced the NH4+ adsorption efficiency of biochar by approximately 5 times. ACB exhibited the best performance at 500 degrees C with an ultrasonic activation time of 480 min, frequency of 45 kHz, and power of 700 W. The ultrasonic activation reduced the biochar ash and induced pore formation, which increased the specific surface area through cavitation corrosion and micro-acoustic flow mechanism. The NH4+ adsorption mechanisms comprised physicochemical processes, of which physical adsorption was dominant. The preparation cost of 1 kg ACB was about 0.42 US dollar, and no secondary pollution occurred in the activation process. The findings prove that ultrasonic technology is efficient and convenient for enhancing biochar adsorption performance, and thus is suitable for industrial applications and promotion.

Thus, scientific evaluation of vegetation restoration consequences is necessary for maintaining the stability of the surface water system and water cycle in semi-arid regions. In this study, we compared the efficiencies of different typical grasslands in regulating runoff and sediment yields and proposed feasible suggestions suiting for local environments. Four grasslands, including two Gramineae species (Elymus dahuricus and Bromus inermis) and two legume species (Medicago saliva and Trifolium repens), were tested during a two-year period with simulated rainfall experiments, and using bare land as control. Three replicates were done for each treatment, and fifteen plots with a slope of 20 degrees were constructed. Three indices were used to assess the runoff and sediment yields reduction capacity of the grasslands, including runoff reduction benefit (RRB), sediment reduction benefit (SRB), and soil infiltration rate (SIR). The results showed that RRB and SRB were significantly different (P < 0.05) among treatments across the two-year experiments. The values of SRB increased considerably in the second year. In particular, the values of SRB for E. dahuricus and B. inermis was 98.79% and 98.07%, respectively, while that of RRB was - 11.84% and 4.01%, respectively. The two Gramineae grasslands showed greater effectiveness in sediment reduction and runoff maintenance than the two legume species owing to the dense fibrous roots and higher biological soil crust coverage. Therefore, Gramineae grasslands can be considered as a suitable management practice to achieve the socio-ecological sustainability of the semi-arid areas during vegetation restoration.

Phylogenetic signals in flea-host interaction networks from four biogeographic realms: differences between interactors and the effects of environmental factors	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY												The structure of ecological interaction networks is associated with evolutionary histories of the interacting species. This is reflected by the phylogenetic signals (PS) in these networks when closely related species interact with similar partners because some traits inherited from the ancestors may determine ecological interactions. We investigated PS for small mammalian hosts and fleas in 80 regional interaction networks from four biogeographic realms (the Palearctic, the Nearctic, the Afrotropics, and the Neotropics). We asked (i) whether the relative strength of PS in host-flea networks is similar between hosts and fleas and/or between realms; (ii) how environmental variation affects the PS of hosts and fleas in their interaction networks; and (iii) whether the PS for hosts or fleas is affected by the phylogenetic diversity of either hosts or fleas, respectively. We found that the PS for hosts was stronger than that for fleas in all realms. An environmental effect on the PS for hosts, but not for fleas, was found in three of the four realms (except the Neotropics). In the Palearctic and the Nearctic, a stronger PS was characteristic for cooler and/or drier regions, whereas the opposite was the case for the Afrotropics in regard to precipitation. The phylogenetic diversity of regional host and flea assemblages was not associated with the values of the respective PS in any realm. We conclude that the pattern of the relative strength of the PS for hosts and fleas in their interaction networks is similar in different biogeographic realms with vastly different host and flea faunas. However, the environmental effects on the PS are geographically variable and might be associated with the history of host-flea associations, as well as the spatial pattern of environmental variation, within a realm.(c) 2022 Australian Society for Parasitology.

J	Li, WX; Feng, ZM; Zhang, CX				Li, Wenxin; Feng, Zimao; Zhang, Chunxia			Ammonium transporter PsAMT1.2 from <i>Populus simonii</i> functions in nitrogen uptake and salt resistance	TREE PHYSIOLOGY												Ammonium (NH4+) is a primary nitrogen (N) source for many species, and NH4+ uptake is mediated by various transporters. However, the effects of NH4+ transporters on N uptake and metabolism under salt stress remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the expression characteristics and transport function of PsAMT1.2 in Populus simonii and its role in ammonium uptake and metabolism under salt stress. PsAMT1.2 was localized in the plasma membrane highly expressed in the roots. Heterologous functionality tests demonstrated that PsAMT1.2 mediates NH4+ permeation across the plasma membrane in yeast mutants, restoring growth. A short-term NH4+ uptake experiment showed that PsAMT1.2 is a high-affinity NH4+ transporter with a K-m value of 80.603 mu M for NH4+. Compared with the wild type (WT, Populus tremula x Populus alba INRA 717-IB4 genotype), PsAMT1.2-overexpressing transgenic poplar grew better, with higher increases in stem height and relative chlorophyll content under both control and salt-stress conditions. PsAMT1.2 overexpression significantly increased the total NH4+ concentration and total N of whole plants under salt stress. The glutamate synthase (GS), glutamine synthetase (GOGAT) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activities and the total amino acids largely increased in the roots of PsAMT1.2-overexpressing transgenic plants compared with the WT plants under control conditions, suggesting that PsAMT1.2 overexpression promotes NH4+ assimilation and metabolism in poplar roots. Consistent with the increased total amino acid content, GS1.3, GS2 and Fd-GOGAT expression was upregulated in the roots and leaves of the PsAMT1.2-overexpressing transgenic plants compared with the WT plants under salt stress. Collectively, PsAMT1.2 encodes a high-affinity NH4+ transporter crucial to NH4+ uptake and metabolism under salt stress.					zhang, cl/JDW-6549-2023; zhang, chunmei/IUQ-7038-2023														0829-318X	1758-4469				DEC	2021	41	12					2392	2408		10.1093/treephys/tpab071	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpab071		MAY 2021						34002233					WOS:000742398400013

However, the regulatory mechanisms of rhizobium in alleviating heavy metal stress through the biochemical response of plant-soil system is limited. In this study, alfalfa was inoculated with a copper (Cu)-resistant rhizobium, and its effect on plant growth and the spatial distribution of phosphatase in the rhizosphere under Cu stress was assessed. Our results showed that rhizobium inoculation alleviated Cu-induced growth inhibition, and increased the nitrogen and phosphorus content in alfalfa tissues. Moreover, inoculated plants had a higher Cu uptake than non inoculated plants, with a much higher increase in the roots than in the shoots; thus, inoculation with rhizobium was shown to decrease the transfer coefficient and promote Cu phytostabilization. The zymograms illustrated that the distribution of phosphatase activities was associated with the presence of roots. Compared with the noninoculated treatment, the rhizobium inoculation increased the hotspot areas of phosphatase by 26.1% and 39.3% at the Cu 0 and Cu 800 treatments, respectively, In addition, the available phosphorus in the soil showed negative correlations with soil phosphatase activity (p < 0.05). The model of partial least squares path modelling (PLS-PM) indicated that soil Cu content directly influenced the hotspot areas of phosphatase activities in the rhizosphere and explained most (86%) of the variation. Thus, the enzymatic hotspots were concluded to mainly be affected by the Cu content of soil, and the phosphatase activities in the rhizosphere were mainly regulated by the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus. These findings provide a basis for the spatio temporal dynamics of biogeochemical reactions in the rhizosphere of polluted soils.

It is no consistent conclusion on how the construction of plantations, especially stand density, may affect soil enzymes activities and stoichiometry. The surface soil (0-20 cm) was sampled from Pinus tabuliformis plantations with low- (725-875 stem.hm(-2)), medium- (1375-1500 stem.hm(-2)), and high- (2150-2200 stem.hm(-2)) stand density and natural P. tabuliformis forests with medium- (1250-1400 stem.hm(-2)) and high- (2000-2700 stem.hm(-2)) stand density on the Loess Plateau in China. We measured the activities of C-, N-, and P-degrading enzymes (beta-1,4-glucosidase, BG; beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase, NAG; leucine aminopeptidase, LAP; and alkaline phosphatase, AP) and other major environment factors (i.e., vegetation characteristics, soil physicochemical properties, and microbial biomass). We found that (1) the activities of soil C- (BG), N- (NAG + LAP), and P- (AP) degrading enzymes were significantly higher in plantations than in natural forests owing to the lower soil nutrients content. (2) The soil enzyme stoichiometry ratio (C:N:P) of the natural forests and plantations deviated from the global average. Furthermore, the C:N and C:P ratios significantly decreased due to the significant increase of N- and P- degrading enzymes activities in medium- and high-density plantations. (3) Vector analysis showed that soil microbes were limited by C and N in natural forests. On the other hand, afforestation alleviated microbial C limitation, intensified N limitation, and caused P limitation. (4) The RDA analysis showed that soil enzymes activities and stoichiometry were mainly affected by soil organic C, available P, and microbial biomass C. Low-density P. tabuliformis plantations are conducive to improving ecological forest structure and plant diversity and may reduce soil microbial N and P limitation.					li, bai/JNE-1502-2023; xuan, li/JNI-7432-2023; Wang, Jiacheng/ABE-5948-2020	WANG, jie/0009-0004-1824-7244													0341-8162	1872-6887				APR	2022	211								105982	10.1016/j.catena.2021.105982	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.105982													WOS:000790433800003

Developing friendlier biodiesel production process via systematic inherent safety interventions	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												The efficacy of inherent safety interventions for shaping Friendlier Chemical Processes (FCP) has been demonstrated in simultaneously augmenting safety (S), health (H), and environmental (E) performance while operating economically. However, there is limited attention to linking inherent safety concept with HE and cost issues when modifying process design, and a hierarchical metric used for measuring the inherent friendliness is yet to be presented. To this end, this study developed a Reconciled Friendly Process Metric (RFPM) for generating FCP via Systematic Inherent Safety (SIS) modifications. Firstly, the prestigious inherent SHE and cost metrics were selected and adapted to measure friendliness features. Then, the metrics were reconciled by Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation (FCE), and finally, the RFPM was validated through biodiesel production process. The results show that the base design is estimated as under Moderate (M) condition, while the modified design is estimated as under Relatively Friendly (RF) condition, which implies that the modified design is inherently friendlier than the base design. This newly developed RFPM can be used as a tool for hierarchically indicating the friendliness of processing scenarios and making trade-offs among safety, health, environmental, and cost concerns during design stage.

In this regard, a study was carried out as split-factorial experiment in a sandy soil in semi-arid region of Iran for two years (2014 and 2015). Three irrigation regimes including irrigation after depleting 40%, 60% and 80% (I1, I2 and I3) of available soil water (ASW) were considered as main plots. The sub-plots consisted of factorial combinations of three nitrogen fertilizer treatments (F1: 100% organic, F2: integrated treatment and F3: 100% chemical treatment) and three levels of zeolite (10, 5 and 0 ton ha(-1)). The organic and chemical sources of nitrogen were respectively manure farmyard and urea, and integrated treatment included 50% organic + 50% chemical nitrogen. The results showed that water deficit caused a considerable decrease in agronomic performance, productivity, water use efficiency (WUE), grain's oil and protein concentration. In most treatments, both manure farmyard and zeolite application increased chlorophyll content (SPAD), biological yield, grain yield and oil, protein concentration within sunflower's grain. Regardless of the irrigation regime, the highest oil concentrations were achieved by applying integrated treatment accompanied by 10 ton ha(-1) zeolite. The results demonstrated that using manure farmyard (either 100% or 50%) accompanied by zeolite as input caused significant improvement in WUE. The improvement in WUE resulted from higher grain yield due to implementing organic nutrition and amending soil with zeolite.																			0010-3624	1532-2416				MAR 25	2020	51	6					711	725		10.1080/00103624.2020.1729791	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2020.1729791		MAR 2020											WOS:000518269800001

We hypothesized that fangs serve like disposable needles and predicted a high loss rate and, hence, high replacement rate in free-ranging snakes. Snakes also possess smaller rear teeth that aid in gripping and swallowing the prey. We reasoned that these teeth are less delicate than fangs and predicted that their loss would be at a slower rate than fangs. To test our predictions, we analyzed fecal samples of free-ranging Saharan sand vipers, Cerastes vipera, in the Northern Negev desert, Israel. Close to 25% of fecal samples contained fangs, averaging more than one fang per sample and, consequently, our first prediction was supported. We estimated that fangs are replaced each fourth predation, and that replacement rate under natural conditions is at a high rate of approximately every twenty days. Fecal samples contained rear teeth at the same proportion as fangs, which indicated that the rapid replacement of teeth was not limited only to fangs and, therefore, our second prediction was not supported. These findings reflect the importance of both front fangs and rear teeth in the hunting of prey in free-ranging C. vipera. This is the first quantitative report of fang and rear teeth loss in a free-ranging viperid which is based on their recovery in feces; and we believe that similar high rates of loss occur in other viperid species.

This study examined streamflow regime changes by applying the indicators of hydrologic alteration method and eco-flow metrics to daily runoff data (1965-2016) from the Sandu, Hulu and Dali Rivers on the Chinese Loess Plateau, and then determined their responses to terracing, afforestation and damming. The Budyko water balance equation and the double mass curve method were used to separate the impacts of climate change and human activities on the mean discharge changes. The results showed that the terraced and dammed watersheds exhibited significant decreases in annual runoff. All hydrologic metrics indicated that the highest degree of hydrologic alteration was in the Sandu River watershed (terraced), where the monthly and extreme flows reduced significantly. In contrast, the annual eco-deficit increased significantly, indicating the highest reduction in streamflow among the three watersheds. The regulation of dams and reservoirs in the Dali River watershed has altered the flow regime, and obvious decreases in the maximum flow and slight increases in the minimum flow and baseflow indices were observed. In the Hulu River watershed (afforested), the monthly flow and extreme flows decreased slightly and were categorized as low-degree alteration, indicating that the long-term delayed effects of afforestation on hydrological processes. The magnitude of the eco-flow metrics varied with the alteration of annual precipitation. Climate change contributed 67.47% to the runoff reduction in the Hulu River watershed, while human activities played predominant roles in reducing runoff in the Sandu and Dali River watersheds. The findings revealed distinct patterns and causes of streamflow regime alteration due to different conservation measures, emphasizing the need to optimize the spatial allocation of measures to control soil erosion and utilize water resources on the Loess Plateau.					; Gao, Peng/K-7487-2014	Zhao, Guangju/0000-0001-7756-4494; Gao, Peng/0000-0002-4723-4256; Zhao, Guangju/0000-0002-4233-9403; zhang, shuyu/0000-0002-8539-2378													0885-6087	1099-1085				OCT	2021	35	10							e14401	10.1002/hyp.14401	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14401													WOS:000711813100018

A general understanding of microbial metabolism and nutrient limitation under human disturbance in arid and semi-arid regions, which are the largest and most fragile oligotrophic ecosystems globally, however, is still limited. We quantified and compared the characteristics of nutrient limitation of soil microbes under natural/artificial grassland and shrubland, an ecological forest, an economic forest, and sloped cropland in typical arid and semi-arid ecosystems on the Loess Plateau, China. Vegetation restoration significantly affected the activities of extracellular enzymes and ecoenzymatic stoichiometry mainly by affecting soil nutrients and nutrient stoichiometry. A vector analysis of enzyme activity indicated that microbial communities were co-limited by carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) in all types of vegetation restoration. Linear regression indicated that microbial C and P limitations were significantly correlated with the stoichiometry of soil nutrient, suggesting that the balance of nutrient stoichiometry is an important factor maintaining microbial metabolism and elemental homeostasis. C and P limitations in the microbial communities were the lowest in the natural grassland. This implies that both vegetation and microbial communities under the restoration pattern of natural grassland were more stable under environmental stress, so the restoration of natural grassland should be recommended as the preferred option for ecosystem restoration in these arid and semi-arid regions.

The aim of this study was to determine if the variation in soil leachate caused by plant diversity could affect the soil microbial community.MethodsA microcosm experiment was conducted to determine the effect of plant diversity on the soil microbial community by measuring soil leachate in a gradient of plant richness from levels 1 (one species) to 3 (three species).ResultsPlant richness significantly affected the diversity of soil leachate and microbial communities. The amount and diversity of soil leachate, microbial biomass carbon (C), basal respiration, beta-1,4-glucosidase activity, beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity, bacterial biomass, fungal biomass, total microorganism biomass, and microbial diversity (Shannon diversity index and evenness) were highest at richness level 3. Changes in the microbial community were best explained by variation in the amount and diversity of leachate. Linear regression and correlation analyses indicated that leachate diversity had a close association with microbial Shannon diversity and evenness, whereas leachate amount had a close association with microbial biomass C, total microbial biomass, bacterial biomass, enzyme activities, and abundance of microbial groups. An ordinary least squares multiple regression and the structural equation model demonstrated that leachate amount had a greater effect on microbial biomass than leachate diversity, which had a greater impact on microbial Shannon diversity and evenness.ConclusionsOur results indicate that plant diversity drives changes in soil microbial communities by altering the amount and diversity of leachate in the soil. The diversity of soil leachate determined the diversity of the microbial community to some extent.

A large number of croplands have been converted to orchards on the Chinese Loess Plateau due to the increased economic benefits which result. However, the microbial community and their functional composition remain poorly understood. In this study, soil samples were collected from croplands and orchards. Soil physicochemical properties and the community (represented by 16S rRNA for bacteria and ITS for fungi) were measured, and interactions among species and the soil organic matter (SOM) degradation via microbial metabolism and its associated genes were analyzed. Croplands converted to orchards affected bacterial and fungal community structure by increasing the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Ascomycota, whereas it decreased the alpha-diversity of bacteria and fungi. The co-occurrence network was larger and more complex within croplands than within orchards, indicating more extensive interactions and higher community stability potential. The abundance of potential genes related to cellulose and hemicellulose metabolism in orchards was higher than that in croplands, whereas the abundance of genes related to lignin decomposition was lower than that in croplands. In addition, the abundance of saprotrophic and symbiotrophic fungi in orchards was significantly lower than that in croplands (27 and 88%, respectively), whereas the abundance of pathotrophic fungi in orchards was almost six-times that in croplands. The soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil C:N in orchards were significantly lower than that in croplands. Converting croplands to orchards significantly altered the microbial community composition and their functionality, as well as decreased the complexity of interaction between microorganisms. The decreased SOC and increased soil C:N ratio could be attributed to these variations. Improved management practices should be implemented for the maintenance of soil biodiversity and SOC in orchards to avoid soil degradation and ensure sustainable development.

Phenotypic analysis demonstrated that knocking out the homologous gene of the most down-regulated auxin-responsive TabZIP6D_20 in Arabidopsis (AtHY5) decreased its sensitivity to 1 and 50 mu M IAA, while the TabZIP6D_20/hy5 complementary lines recovered its sensitivity to auxin as a wild type (Wassilewskija), suggesting that the down-regulated TabZIP6D_20 was a negative factor in the auxin-signaling pathway. These results demonstrated that the auxin-responsive TabZIP genes might have various and vital functions in the architecture of a wheat leaf under auxin response.																				1422-0067				JAN	2023	24	1							756	10.3390/ijms24010756	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms24010756								36614202					WOS:000909058000001
J	Wang, D; Wang, L				Wang, Di; Wang, Li			Characteristics of soil evaporation at two stages of growth in apple orchards with different ages in a semi-humid region	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Soil evaporation (E) accounts for a significant portion of the hydrological cycle especially under hot and dry conditions. The Loess Plateau of China contains the world's largest area of apple orchards cultivated in a rather extensive way (720 trees ha-1), while few studies were conducted to explore the characteristics of E at different stages of growth in apple orchards with different ages in water-limited regions. In this work, we measured E, sap flow, throughfall, stemflow and the leaf area index (LAI) in 7-and 17-year-old rainfed apple orchards in Changwu County on the Loess Plateau from May to September 2012-2015. We divided the stages of growth of the apple trees into stage I (rapid foliar growth) and stage II (rapid fruit enlargement and maturation) based on the seasonal variation of LAI and constructed empirical models for predicting E in each orchard at different growth stages. Tree age clearly affected the dynamics of daily E and the ratio of E to evapotranspiration (E:ET) for apple orchards. Daily E and E:ET during the four growing seasons were significantly higher for the 7-year-old orchard (1.3 +/- 0.5 mm d-1 and 55.1 +/- 10.4%, respectively) than the 17-year-old orchard (1.1 +/- 0.5 mm d-1 and 44.1 +/- 10.9%, respectively) (p < 0.05). Daily E and E:ET for both orchards also differed between the two growth stages and were significantly higher at growth stage I (p < 0.05) according with the higher solar radiation reaching the soil level. The stage of growth influenced the performance of empirical E models for apple orchards. Compared with measured daily E, simulated daily E was underestimated for the young orchard and over-estimated for the old orchard at growth stage II. The relationships between daily E for each orchard and biotic/ abiotic factors differed between the two growth stages. Daily E for both orchards was more likely to be affected by meteorological factors and soil temperature in the 0-20 cm layers at growth stage II. This study highlights the significant effects of tree age and growth stage on the characteristics of daily E and E:ET and the performance of empirical E models for apple orchards in a semi-humid region.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				APR 30	2023	280								108233	10.1016/j.agwat.2023.108233	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2023.108233		FEB 2023											WOS:000944482100001

Inherent health oriented design for preventing sick building syndrome during planning stage	JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING												Derived from inherent safety concept, inherent health is a new approach that aims to unearth proactive, fundamental, and permanent solutions that could eliminate or significantly reduce health risks at source, thus avoiding adding extensive end-of-pipe protections. To date, however, limited attention has been given to using this new approach to prevent Sick Building Syndrome (SBS), and an assessment tool for quantifying the "sickness" at planning stage is yet to be established. To this end, this work investigated the feasibility of addressing SBS via Inherent Health Oriented Design (IHOD) and developed SBS Contributory Indices (SBSCI) for quantifying the sickness severity. Firstly, the contributory indices were extracted from a well-practiced checklist of SBS determinants. Then, the indices were reconciled using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and equation-based Bayesian Networks (BN), and finally, the newly developed metric (i.e., SBSCI) was exemplified by a case study. The results show that the sickness level decreased by approximately 82% after IHOD modifications, implying that the modified architectural design can be less sick (inherently healthier) than the baseline design. This work presents a nexus study between the implications of "inherent" solutions and healthy buildings. This cross-cutting study would offer a new perspective on the early inspection and prevention for sick building induced health problems.

The objective of this study was to examine the root diameter, root density, root tensile strength and soil shear strength for five typical and widely distributed Poaceae grasses in semi-arid regions, thus determine the contribution of roots of artificial grassland to soil erosion resistance. Results showed that the roots of five grasslands were densely distributed in the surface soils (0-10 cm). Bromus inermis had the strongest roots that characterized by the highest average tensile strength (40.2 MPa) The shear strength significantly increased as the vertical stress increased from 50 kPa to 300 kPa, but the degree varied with grassland types. Shear strength was also linearly correlated with root density when vertical pressure reached 300 kPa (p < 0.01, R-2 = 0.47), indicating that high root density might help resist extreme external stress. Moreover, Bromus inermis showed a high soil cohesion of 122.7 kPa (next to the highest value of 128.71 kPa in Panicum virgatum). Overall, Bromus inermis showed the highest soil erosion resistance among these five grasslands, could be a good candidate in Poaceae artificial grasslands to improve soil shear strength for topsoil conservation. These findings have potential implications for understanding the contribution of Poaceae grasses' roots on the topsoil reinforcement, and provide a theoretical basis for artificial grassland establishment on soil erosion resistance on the Loess Plateau.

In this study, a 4-year field experiment (from 2017 to 2021) was conducted to analyze the effects of N fertilizer types (CRUNU and normal urea (NU)) and application rates (low level (L), 135 kg ha(-1); medium level (M), 180 kg ha(-1); high level (H), 225 kg ha(-1)) on population lodging resistance, basal internode strength, lignin content and synthetase activity, stem lodging resistance, grain yield, and yield stability of wheat. Our results showed that the two N fertilizer types had the highest lodging rate under high N application rates, and the M-CRUNU treatment showed the lowest lodging rate. Compared with NU, CRUNU improved the wheat population lodging resistance under the three N application rates, mainly related to improving wheat population characteristics and breaking the strength of the second basal internode. Correlation analysis showed that the breaking strength of the second basal internode was related to the physical characteristics, chemical components, and micro-structure of the internode. Compared with NU, CRUNU significantly increased wheat grain yield by 4.47, 14.62, and 3.12% under low, medium, and high N application rates, respectively. In addition, CRUNU showed no significant difference in grain yield under medium and high N application rates, but it presented the highest yield stability under the medium N application rate. In summary, CRUNU, combined with the medium N application rate, is an efficient agronomic management strategy for wheat production.																			2095-3119	2352-3425				OCT	2023	22	10					3006	3021		10.1016/j.jia.2023.02.039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jia.2023.02.039													WOS:001115867400001

Phylogenetic patterns in regional flea assemblages from 6 biogeographic realms: strong links between flea and host phylogenetic turnovers and weak effects of phylogenetic originality on host specificity	PARASITOLOGY												We investigated phylogenetic patterns in flea assemblages from 80 regions in 6 biogeographic realms and asked whether (a) flea phylogenetic turnover is driven by host phylogenetic turnover, environmental dissimilarity or geographic distance; (b) the relative importance of these drivers differs between realms; and (c) the environmental drivers of flea phylogenetic turnover are similar to those of host phylogenetic turnover. We also asked whether the phylogenetic originality of a flea species correlates with the degree of its host specificity and whether the phylogenetic originality of a host species correlates with the diversity of its flea assemblages. We found that host phylogenetic turnover was the best predictor of flea phylogenetic turnover in all realms, whereas the effect of the environment was weaker. Environmental predictors of flea phylogenetic turnover differed between realms. The importance of spatial distances as a predictor of the phylogenetic dissimilarity between regional assemblages varied between realms. The responses of host turnover differed from those of fleas. In 4 of the 6 realms, geographic distances were substantially better predictors of host phylogenetic turnover than environmental gradients. We also found no general relationship between flea phylogenetic originality and its host specificity in terms of either host species richness or host phylogenetic diversity. We conclude that flea phylogenetic turnover is determined mainly by the phylogenetic turnover of their hosts rather than by environmental gradients. Phylogenetic patterns in fleas are manifested at the level of regional assemblages rather than at the level of individual species.																			0031-1820	1469-8161				APR	2023	150	5					455	467		10.1017/S003118202300015X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S003118202300015X		FEB 2023						36799019					WOS:000947169400001

We investigated the pathways connecting these two types of heterogeneities in sand stabilization that were created by contrasting forces of various human activities and long-term droughts, and pathogen occurrence in host populations. The considered candidate ecological mediators were various components of host community structure, arthropod vector traits, and the pathogen occurrence in these vectors. Location North-western Negev Desert's sands in Israel. Time period 1982-2018. Major taxa studied Gerbillus andersoni, Gerbillus floweri, Gerbillus gerbillus, Mycoplasma, Bartonella, Synosternus cleopatrae. Methods We combined information from satellite images, 36 years of rodent censuses, a natural experiment, and causal modelling. Results We found evidence that the spatial heterogeneity in sand biocrusts is largely correlated with structural differences between host communities, especially at medium spatial scales. Pathogen sampling, followed by causal modelling, suggested that the cascading effect of sand stabilization on pathogen occurrence is mainly mediated through changes in host community structure and vector burdens. Importantly, we found that structural changes in the same host community can simultaneously amplify and dilute different pathogens. Main conclusions These findings suggest that global processes can translate into local processes, where the importance of the mediation effects depend on the magnitude of environmental heterogeneity. These mediation effects can benefit some organisms while adversely affecting others.

At low plant density, the expression of prolificacy (i.e., more than one fertile ear per plant) can stabilize maize production. Considering N as the main limiting resource, yield can be defined as a function of i) total N uptake and the efficiency to produce yield from total N uptake, i.e., N internal efficiency (NIE) or ii) total N uptake, N harvest index (NHI) and grain N concentration. The objective of this work was to describe changes in NIE and their related components regulated by prolificacy at both canopy- and plant- scales. Field studies were carried out in Buenos Aires, Argentina, during 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 seasons. Treatments were combinations of two N supplies (N-: 0 and N + : 200 kg N ha(-1)), two plant densities (4 and 8 plants m(-2)) and five maize hybrids released during the last four decades. High N supply positively impacted yield per unit area (ca. 45 %) by increasing kernel number (ca. 33 %), kernel weight (ca. 18 %) and harvest index (ca. 12 %). At low plant density, high N supply expressed the highest prolificacy (mean 1.65 ears plant(-1)). The older hybrids displayed the highest prolificacy (mean 1.30 ears plant(-1)) and the lowest yield per unit area (mean 792 g m(-2)), but showed the greatest grain N concentration (mean 15.1 g kg(-1)). However, recent hybrids resulted in medium prolificacy (mean 1.11 ears plant(-1)) with the highest yield per unit area (mean 910 g m(-2)), but with the lowest grain N concentration (mean 13.6g kg(-1)). The different pattern of grain N concentration among hybrids coupled with similar NHI (mean 0.80) led to the lowest NIE of the most prolific hybrids (mean 55 g yield g N-1) relative to the less prolific ones (mean 60 g yield g N-1). Variations in NIE among genotypes and plant densities were negatively influenced by grain N concentration under N- and under N+ only when prolificacy = 1. Under N+ with prolificacy > 1, NIE variations were positively determined by NHI. For all genotypes, higher yield per plant (mean 30 %) and total N uptake (mean 25 %) were recorded for the prolific plants, reflected in the greater absolute NIE (mean 5 %). For the oldest hybrid differences between prolific and non-prolific plants in NIE (mean 46.8 vs 41.8 g yield g N-1) were greater than those recorded for the other genotypes due to the higher impact of prolificacy on yield per plant (mean 51 %) than on total N uptake (mean 26 %). Over time, improvements in NIE primarily occurred from greater yield of the apical ear. Overall, the expression of prolificacy appears to be an adequate strategy to stabilize maize production in response to improvements of environmental conditions, specially addressed by low plant density and high N supply.

Aariff			Greenhouse gas emissions from integrated nutrient management practices in pearl millet plus <i>Melia dubia</i> agri-silvi system	CURRENT SCIENCE												Climate change induced due to the magnitudinal rise in proportions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in the environment has emerged as an indubitable concern across the globe. Hence, the impact of various organic forms of manure on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the soil and global warming potential (GWP) was studied in pearl millet + Melia dubia agri-silvi system. Replacing 25% of nitrogen with farmyard manure (FYM), poultry manure and pongamia green leaf manure (PGLM) elevated CO2 emissions by 8.81%, 12.39%, 15.88% and N2O emissions by 47.5%, 49.8% and 55.8% respectively, compared to full recommended dose of fertilizer through neem-coated urea treatment. Also, 100% recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF) using neem-coated urea is effective in reducing GWP by 19% over 100% RDF through normal urea. GWP of all the treatments ranged from 1029 (unfertilized) to 1807 kg CO2 eq. ha(-1) (sole crop without trees). The study also reported lower CO2 and N2O emissions under the tree compared to sole crop without trees, which suggests that agroforestry would reduce the overall GHG emissions. Also, use of organic manure along with inorganic fertilizers showed better carbon efficiency ratio and soil fertility status in spite of increase in GWP.																			0011-3891					SEP 10	2021	121	5					704	708		10.18520/cs/v121/i5/704-708	http://dx.doi.org/10.18520/cs/v121/i5/704-708													WOS:000693654800027

Dynamic Inherently Safer Modifications: Metric development and its validation for fire and explosion prevention	JOURNAL OF LOSS PREVENTION IN THE PROCESS INDUSTRIES												Of the numerous inherent safety assessment tools, a dynamic metric capable of investigating and incorporating the temporal risk evolution when conducting Inherently Safer Modifications (ISMs) is yet to be established. To this end, this work developed a Dynamic Inherent Safety Metric (DISM) and validated its functionality and viability through a case study. Firstly, the Information-Flow-based Accident-causing Model (IFAM) was adapted to construct the topology of Bayesian Networks (BN). Then, Bayesian deductive reasoning was executed to do crucial risk identification by ranking posterior probabilities. Finally, risk-based ISMs were performed to address the relatively contributing risk factors. The case study results show that the fire and explosion risk decreased by approximately a third after implementing ISMs, thus demonstrating that the modified processing scenario could be inherently safer than the original processing scenario. The newly developed inherent safety metric (i.e., DISM) can assist in temporal risk identification and assessment, and it is expected to function as a novel assessment tool for measuring and comparing the inherent safeness before and after implementing ISMs with simultaneous considerations on the time-varying risk factors.

This study aims to model the Land Surface Temperature (LST), Urban Heat Island (UHI), Urban Heat Hotspot (UHS), Normalized Difference Built-Up Index (NDBI), Enhanced Built-Up and Bareness Index (EBBI), Ecological Evaluation Index (EEI), Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI) of Mekelle city, Tigray-Northern Ethiopia. The Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal InfraRed sensor (TIRS-1) bands were used. The results indicated that the mean LST was highest (38.69 degrees C) in the Semen sub-city. A total area of 33.4 Km(2) (30.56%) was classified as UHI dominantly located in the Semen sub-city. Moreover, about 38 Km(2) (34.61%) was characterized with the worst EEI. The UHS zones were covering a total area of 3.03 Km(2) (2.8%) and it is mainly concentrated in the Semen sub-city. In addition, the statistical relationship between LST and NDBI is negative and moderately strong (r = - 0.51, p < 0.001) due to the fact that most of the built-up area in the city is mixed with vegetation cover that cools the environment. We also found that an R-2 of 0.997 (p < 0.001) in all UTFVI indices. The multiple regression model result indicated that Pv, NDBI, and EBBI control LST negatively, whereas the LST, UTFVI, EEI and NDVI influences LST positively.

Agrobiodiversity is fundamentally shaped by farmers' preferences and management practices, and these are again shaped by the farmers' social and cultural background. This study investigates variety preferences and seed management practices in the crop sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) among the Kunama and the Tigrayan ethnolinguistic groups living side by side in Northern Ethiopia. Surveys were conducted in 10 villages located in two districts inhabited by the two ethnolinguistic groups and analyzed using descriptive and multinominal analysis. We find important differences in varieties grown across the ethnolinguistic groups, but we also find that ethnicity and geographic proximity interact and affect trait preference and seed management practices. Altogether, 22 varieties are cultivated, and few farmers cultivated improved varieties, especially among the Kunama. Respondents considered use traits as important as agronomic traits when selecting sorghum varieties. Notably, preferred use traits were not limited to food (e.g., construction materials were important for the Kunama), and preferred agronomic traits were not focused on drought resistance. Timing of seed selection, seed selection criteria (e.g., panicle size and color), and seed storage practices differed among the ethnic groups. Understanding cultural and social preferences towards sorghum varieties, their traits, and the criteria used for seed management is crucial for the success of crop breeding programs, climate change adaptation policies, and development interventions.					de Boer, Hugo/B-5640-2015	de Boer, Hugo/0000-0003-1985-7859; Wendmu, Tsedal/0000-0003-1178-1087; Abebe, Haftom/0000-0001-6769-210X													0013-0001	1874-9364				SEP	2022	76	3					233	249		10.1007/s12231-022-09555-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12231-022-09555-6		SEP 2022											WOS:000852811200001

Meanwhile, to show the utilisation potential of alluvial fans, we analysed the land use, their distance from the roads, places (town and village) and rivers. The results showed 826 alluvial fans exist in LRB, with a total area of 1166.03 km(2). The number of alluvial fans with areas between 0.1 and 1 km(2) is 517, accounting for 62.59% of the total number of alluvial fans. Grassland is the dominant land use type, accounting for 68.70% of the total area of alluvial fans. The cropland area accounted for 2.16% of alluvial fans and accounted for 18.98% of the total cropland area in LRB. Exactly 93.70%, 53.63% and 61.86% of the total number of alluvial fans were located within 5 km from the tertiary road, village, and river, respectively. To sum up, our survey results showed that alluvial fans are important land resources in LRB and may have huge utilisation potential.

To investigate how rainfall depth and frequency alter soil respiration (SR), a rainfall simulation experiment was conducted in grassland communities dominated by Artemisia gmelinii and Lespedeza davurica in Loess Plateau of China. SR rate (R-s), soil temperature (T-s) and soil volumetric water content (S-v) were monitored before and after the rainfall treatments, that is, four depths (5, 10, 20 and 40 mm) and three frequencies (40 mm x 1, 20 mm x 2 and 10 mm x 4) during the growing season (June to September). Results indicated that the response magnitude of R-s increased with rainfall depths, reaching the maximum under 40 mm, and the increments were tightly related to rainfall frequency and community type. The increase and mean value of R-s in A. gmelinii community were significantly higher than those in L. davurica and bare land under same rainfall depth. L. davurica community was more sensitive to rainfall lower than 10 mm, whereas it had weaker but longer response under rainfall larger than 10 mm compared with A. gmelinii community. Successive rainfall events dampened the pulse effect of R-s but generated more cumulative CO2 emission in vegetation communities. T-s and S-v varied significantly with rainfall depth and co-regulated SR. These findings implied more CO2 will be released from soil in the semiarid grasslands under extreme and successive rainfalls and emphasized the importance of species impact on SR for soil carbon evaluation under future rainfall regimes.

J	Zhang, FB; Wang, M; Yang, MY				Zhang, Fengbao; Wang, Min; Yang, Mingyi			Successful application of the Taguchi method to simulated soil erosion experiments at the slope scale under various conditions	CATENA												The benefits of the Taguchi method have been demonstrated in diverse fields. However, its applicability to soil erosion experiments at the slope scale under various conditions remains unclear. Using 6 published datasets that included the dependent variables of erosion rate (D), runoff rate (R), sediment concentration (C), flow velocity (V) and transport capacity (Tc), we compared the results from the full-factorial design method with those from the Taguchi and orthogonal design methods to validate the applicability of the Taguchi method to simulated soil erosion experiments at the slope scale under different conditions. The statistical parameters of the dependent variables from the orthogonal design and Taguchi method were very close to those from the full-factorial design for all dependent variables. The trends of the main effects based on different factor levels were consistent for 35 out of 45 sets from the full-factorial design and Taguchi method and for 27 sets from the orthogonal design. The optimum conditions for 10 and 7 dependent variables (out of 14) for the Taguchi and orthogonal design methods were the same as those for the full-factorial design, respectively. In addition, 13 and 8 dependent variables (out of 14) for the Taguchi and orthogonal design methods had the same factor rank order of percentage contributions as the full-factorial design method, respectively. Based on a univariate analysis of variance, the evaluating indicators for predictive power, including the determination coefficient, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, relative root mean squared error, mean absolute percentage error and Thiel inequality coefficient, indicated that the Taguchi method predictions were better than the orthogonal design predictions. Overall, the Taguchi method could obtain more reliable conclusions for soil erosion than the orthogonal design method at the slope scale. These findings suggest that the Taguchi method could be successfully applied to soil erosion experiments and could better replace the full-factorial design method at the slope scale compared with the orthogonal design method.

Differences in the physiological responses of <i>Rht13</i> and <i>rht</i> wheat lines to short-term osmotic stress	CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS												GA-insensitive dwarfing genes e.g. Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b have been widely used to reduce plant height, increase grain yield and improve harvest index values. GA-responsive dwarfing genes, such as Rht13, have potential for wheat improvement but are not used in commercial breeding. Here, a set of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of varying height was developed from a cross of Rht13-containing Magnif M1 and Rht8-containing Jinmai 47. These RILs (Rht13 and rht) were used to evaluate the effects of Rht13 on wheat drought resistance under hydroponics conditions simulated by polyethylene glycol-6000 (10% PEG). Under osmotic stress, Rht13 seedlings showed significantly lower transpiration rates than rht lines. The Rht13 seedlings also had relatively higher photosynthetic rates and lower leaf water loss rates and higher leaf relative water content than rht lines. While investigating the reasons underlying these differences, we found that the Rht13 lines' root system could reduce the decrease in root hydraulic conductance (Lp) via osmotic adjustment and via modulating the expression of plasma membrane aquaporins (TaPIPs). Because of the reduced transpiration rate, severely reduced shoot water loss and improved water uptake ability of roots under short-term osmotic stress, the Rht13 seedlings maintained their overall water balance more effectively than did the rht seedlings. These findings demonstrate that the dwarfing allele is a potential candidate for wheat breeding programs aiming to improve performance in arid and semi-arid regions.					yan, jiakun J/F-5013-2011; yan, jiakun/GRJ-3297-2022; Yan, Jiakun/AAN-5352-2020	yan, jiakun/0000-0001-8844-6098; Yan, Jiakun/0000-0001-8844-6098													0133-3720	1788-9170				MAR	2020	48	1					41	47		10.1007/s42976-020-00012-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42976-020-00012-5		JAN 2020											WOS:000522608600001

Comparison of Evapotranspiration and Biomass Simulation in Winter Wheat under Conventional and Conservation Tillage Systems using APEX Model	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												The Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX) is one of the hydrologic and water quality models being used in the USDA-ARS Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) to evaluate current and develop sustainable agricultural production systems throughout the United States. Tillage practices used affect agricultural production, soil erosion, and evapotranspiration (ET), which is a major component of the hydrologic cycle. However, there is limited literature on the impact of tillage practices on parameterization and performance of APEX to simulate ET. The goals of this study were to 1) determine model parameters that affect ET simulation in APEX model for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) fields managed under conservation and conventional tillage systems, and 2) evaluate the ability of APEX to simulate ET and daily biomass for each of these tillage systems in central Oklahoma. Tillage system had an impact on the number and type of APEX parameters sensitive for simulation of ET. Therefore, it is essential to perform a sensitivity analysis for study areas with different tillage management practices to determine appropriate parameters for inclusion in the calibration process. Overall, APEX simulated daily, biweekly, and monthly ET and daily biomass relatively well for both tillage systems. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for the simulated monthly ET of the calibrated model was 0.98 and 0.96 for conservation and conventional tillage fields, respectively. The percent bias (PBIAS) values for the ET simulation were within 3%, while PBIAS values for daily biomass simulation were within 25%, which indicates that the average simulated ET and daily biomass values were within 3% and 25% of the measured ET and daily biomass, respectively, in both tillage fields. This result indicates that a well-calibrated APEX model using appropriate sensitive parameters can simulate ET and biomass satisfactorily in both tillage systems. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, the quality and quantity of manure are often low on smallholder farms in sub-Saharan Africa and the initial effect of manuring on crop yield may be small or even negative. In a two-factorial experiment over four seasons in southern Rwanda, the fertiliser value to a maize crop of manures produced by cattle fed a basal diet of only Chloris gayana grass or a mixed C. gayanaAcacia angustissima diet was compared with that of NPK 17-17-17 and no fertiliser. The potential liming effect of the manures was also evaluated through inclusion (or not) of travertine as the second factor. All amendments were applied only to maize planting holes. The crop failed in season 1 due to drought, but manure application (5 t ha-1) approximately doubled maize yield compared with the unfertilised control during seasons 2-4, while NPK (70 kg N ha-1) increased yield by 3- to 4-fold, with corresponding improvements in crop performance indicators. The mixed diet increased manure quality and maize yield compared with the grass diet in season 4. Liming showed a consistent tendency to improve crop performance indicators and yield, but significant differences were only identified in some cases, possibly because the pH increase was small. The results suggest that in regions where manure availability is limiting, application of reduced rates only to planting holes may be an efficient technology. Enhanced animal feed can result in higher quality manure, and ultimately increase crop yield, if nutrient losses during manure handling and storage can be limited.

J	Liu, Q; Yu, FH; Mu, XM				Liu, Qiang; Yu, Feihong; Mu, Xingmin			Evaluation of the Ecological Environment Quality of the Kuye River Source Basin Using the Remote Sensing Ecological Index	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Landsat remote sensing images obtained from 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 were analyzed. The normalized vegetation index (NDVI), moisture index (WET), land surface temperature (LST), and normalized building-soil index (NDBSI) were extracted based on the four aspects of greenness, humidity, heat, and dryness. The Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) was calculated using principal component analysis to quantitatively analyze and dynamically monitor and evaluate the ecological environment changes in the Kuye River Basin over the past 20 years. From the perspective of spatial and temporal distribution, the ecological and environmental quality of Kuye River Basin had a downward trend from 2000 to 2020. The overall RSEI grade was medium or poor, and the average RSEI decreased. The proportion of excellent and good grade watershed areas decreased, whereas that of medium, low, and poor grade watershed areas increased over the study period. Spatially, RSEI decreased gradually from southeast to northwest. The degraded areas were mainly distributed in urban areas with frequent human activities. Conversely, the superior eco-environmental quality areas were mainly distributed in eastern sections of the watershed. Compared with 2000, the eco-environmental quality of the Yulin urban area and Shenmu County in the southern section of the watershed are worsening.																				1660-4601				OCT	2022	19	19							12500	10.3390/ijerph191912500	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912500								36231800					WOS:000866779000001

However, there is little known about the functions of these genes in wheat to date. Our previous study demonstrated that TaLBD16-4D is conducive to increasing lateral root number in wheat. In the present work, we further examined important agronomical traits of the aerial part of transgenic wheat overexpressing TaLBD16-4D. Interestingly, it was revealed that overexpressing TaLBD16-4D could lead to early heading and multiple alterations of plant architecture, including decreased plant height, increased flag leaf size and stem diameter, reduced spike length and tillering number, improved spike density and grain width, and decreased grain length. Moreover, auxin-responsive experiments demonstrated that the expression of TaLBD16-4D in wild-type (WT) wheat plants showed a significant upregulation through 2,4-D treatment. TaLBD16-4D-overexpression lines displayed a hyposensitivity to 2,4-D treatment and reduced shoot gravitropic response. The expressions of a set of auxin-responsive genes were markedly different between WT and transgenic plants. In addition, overexpressing TaLBD16-4D affected the transcript levels of flowering-related genes (TaGI, TaCO1, TaHd1, TaVRN1, TaVRN2, and TaFT1). Notably, the expression of TaGI, TaCO1, TaHd1, TaVRN1, and TaFT1 displayed significant upregulation under IAA treatment. Collectively, our observations indicated that overexpressing TaLBD16-4D could affect aerial architecture and heading time possibly though participating in the auxin pathway.																			1664-462X					SEP 21	2022	13								911993	10.3389/fpls.2022.911993	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.911993								36212357					WOS:000891410400001

Among three HS fractions (humin, fulvic acid, and humic acid), humin is recognized as the predominant fraction possessing PFRs. Most of the previous studies of HS-PFRs involved their environmental effect; however, very few investigations have been conducted to explore the relationship among structural characteristics, PFRs, and redox capacity of humin. To address the above-mentioned scientific questions, the types and concentrations of PFRs in 10 representative types of soils were investigated by EPR technique. We found that humin from different soils contained PFRs concentration of 0.11x10(16)-5.79x10(16) spins/g and g-factors of less than 2.0030. These PFRs were assigned as carbon-centered "aromatic-type" radicals. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, ultravioletvisible, and the contents of acid groups indicated that the aromatic structure of humin was beneficial for the formation of PFRs. The concentration of PFRs was negatively correlated with phenolic hydroxyl contents (P<0.05) and positively correlated with carboxyl contents (P<0.01). The potential generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in humin was determined by spin-trapping EPR technique. Superoxide radicals (average concentration of up to 5.25x10(13) spins/g) were detected in humin from all soils while hydroxyl radicals were detected only in the samples extracted from red soil, black soil, chestnut soil and brown soil. The redox capacity of humin was evaluated by dithiothreitol (DTT) and 1,1-diphenyl-2picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). The oxidation capacity of humin was in the range of 24-376 nmol/ (min g) and the IC50 was in the range of 0.19-1.83 g/mL, and the It was shown by correlation analysis that the oxidation capacity of humin was directly related to its ROS concentration, and phenolic hydroxyl contributed to the reduction capacity. The removal of bisphenol A (BPA) by humins derived from 10 representative soils indicated that the removal rate of BPA was positively correlated with the oxidation capacity of humin (P<0.05), and the oxidation ability was positively correlated with ROS concentration (P<0.05), confirming that the contribution of ROS to BPA removal efficiency. These results provided a theoretical basis for evaluating the ecological and environmental effects of humin in various soil systems.

Soil infiltration rate plays an important role in determining the inputs from precipitation, which is important for the plant growth and groundwater recharge in semi-arid regions. Soil infiltration rate is generally influenced by belowground biomass (BGB), soil water content (SWC) and other soil properties (total soil porosity, soil mean weight diameter and soil organic carbon). The aim of this study is to understand the effects of plant roots, SWC and other soil properties on soil infiltration rate, and to identify the main factor affecting soil infiltration rate. This study investigated the total soil porosity (TP), soil mean weight diameter (MWD), soil organic carbon (SOC), SWC and plant roots of five grasslands (Bromus inermis, Trifolium repens, Panicum virgatum, Medicago sativa and Miscanthus sinensis). An automatic measurement system of point source device was used to quantify the soil infiltration rate. Results showed that SWC significantly affected the initial infiltration rate (P < 0.05), but plant roots gradually became the main factor affecting soil infiltration rate as the increasing infiltration time. The percentage of root volume (PV) of 0-2 mm was positively correlated with infiltration rate, while the PV of > 4.5 mm was negatively correlated with infiltration rate. Our results indicated that fine roots could increase soil organic matters and form soil pores, thus more determining the potential of soil infiltration than soil water content during the short-term vegetation restoration in semi-arid regions.

Wild soybean (Glycine soja) is a fine germplasm resource, which has a high tolerance to adverse environmental conditions. This study aimed to reveal the mechanism responsible for drought tolerance in drought-tolerant wild soybean. Here, the growth parameters and metabolomics of the two wild soybean varieties' seedlings were analyzed under polyethylene glycol-simulated drought stress using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In total, 61 differentially accumulated metabolites were identified in leaves under polyethylene glycol-6000-simulated drought conditions. Compared with common wild soybean, the drought-tolerant wild soybean grew better. A metabolite profiling analysis suggested that the tricarboxylic acid cycle was enhanced in drought-tolerant wild soybean but inhibited in common wild soybean compared with the control group under simulated drought stress. Thus, the accumulation of osmotic compounds and the enhancement of energy and secondary antioxidant metabolism under drought-stress conditions are the mechanisms responsible for drought tolerance in drought-tolerant wild soybean. The results provide an important theoretical basis for utilizing wild soybean resources.

The effects of environment, hosts and space on compositional, phylogenetic and functional beta-diversity in two taxa of arthropod ectoparasites	PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH												We studied the effects of variation in environmental, host-associated and spatial factors on variation in compositional, phylogenetic/taxonomic and functional facets of beta-diversity in fleas and gamasid mites parasitic on small mammals and asked whether (a) the importance of these factors as drivers of beta-diversity differs among its multiple facets and (b) the effects of variation in environment, hosts and space on beta-diversity variation differ between the two ectoparasite taxa. To understand the relative effects of each group of predictors, we used a distance-based redundancy analysis and variation partitioning. The greatest portions of variation in the compositional beta-diversity of fleas were equally explained by host-associated and spatial predictors, whereas variation in host species composition contributed the most to variation in the compositional beta-diversity of mites. Variation in the phylogenetic (i.e. based on phylogenetic tree) beta-diversity of fleas was mainly due to variation in the phylogenetic composition of host communities, while the taxonomic (i.e. based on Linnean taxonomy) beta-diversity of mites was influenced by environmental variation. Unique contributions of spatial and environmental variation explained most of the variation in functional beta-diversity and its species replacement (= turnover) component (i.e. beta-diversity explained by replacement of species alone) in fleas and mites, respectively. Variation in the richness difference component (i.e. beta-diversity explained by species loss/gain alone) of functional beta-diversity was mainly affected by either variation in the functional composition of host assemblages (fleas) or its joint action with environmental variables (mites). We conclude that the pattern of the relative effects of environmental, host-associated and spatial factors on beta-diversity is context-dependent and may differ among different facets of beta-diversity, among different beta-diversity components and also among taxa dependent on biological affinities.

The model was run for 11 planting windows starting from June 1 and repeated every 7 days until 16 August using long-term historical weather data from the 7 selected sites representing three agro-ecological zones (AEZs). The evaluation with the experimental data showed that the model performance was reasonable and accurately predict crop phenology, total dry matter (TDM) and grain yield for both maize varieties. The seasonal planting date analysis showed that optimum planting windows for 2009EVDT and IWDC2SynF2 depend on the variety, agro-ecozones and sites. Planting from June 15 to 28 simulated the highest mean grain yield for both varieties in all the agro-ecologies. In the Southern Guinea savanna (SGS) where the length of growing season is 180-210 days, the best planting window was June 8-July 19 for 2009EVDT and June 8-July 26 for IWDC2SynF2 in Abuja. The planting window that gives attainable yield at Yelwa, is June 15-July 5 for 2009EVDT and June 8-28 for IWDC2SynF2. In the Northern Guinea savannah (NGS) where the length of growing season is 150-180 days, the optimum planting window is June 15-July 19 for both varieties at Zaria and June 8-July 19 for 2009EVDT and June 8-August 2 for IWDC2SynF2 at Sabon Gari. In the Sudan savannah (SS) where the growing season is 90-120 days, planting of 2009EVDT can be delayed up to the third week of July. For the medium-maturing variety, IWDC2SynF2, planting should be done by the first week of July. Though Yelwa is in the SGS, lower yields and narrower sowing windows were simulated for both varieties than for those of the other locations. This is probably due to the poor soil fertility in this location.

Shrub encroachment enhances the infiltration capacity of alpine meadows by changing the community composition and soil conditions	CATENA												Due to global changes and anthropogenic disturbances shrubs are widely encroaching into alpine meadows, which may have profound impacts on the ecohydrological functioning of these key ecosystems. This phenomenon is particularly alarming in the alpine meadows of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, the headwaters for many of Asia's largest rivers. However, little is known about the extant in which shrub encroachment alters the infiltration capacity of those soils. Here we examined the effects of shrub encroachment on the plant community and soil infiltration processes by contrasting vegetation and infiltration variables between three areas: a reference alpine meadow, an alpine meadow lightly encroached by smaller shrubs, and an alpine meadow heavily encroached by larger shrubs. We found that shrub encroachment reduced herbaceous plants aboveground biomass by 10-24 g m(- 2) and root biomass by 1346-2239 g m(- 2). The sedge functional group was gradually replaced by forbs. Initial infiltration rates gradually increased with shrub encroachment, and were approximately doubled and tripled at the earlier and later stages of encroachment, respectively. Overall, shrub encroachment improved the soil infiltrability by changing soil conditions and inhibiting herbaceous species due to the reduction of surface mattic epipedon and the formation of dead root channels. These findings suggest that the rapid transformation of alpine meadows into shrublands could have drastic effects on the surface runoff and stream flow dynamics of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

One such approach is conservation biological control (CBC), which aims at enhancing pest suppression by using natural enemies, such as predators and parasites. Insectivorous bats are considered as potential natural enemies for CBC of insect agricultural pests. Bats drink from open water sources and forage above them, hence we hypothesized that supplementation of artificial water pools adjacent to desert date plantations might promote the activity and species richness of insectivorous bats in this habitat, thereby contributing to pest suppression. We predicted that bats will be more attracted to the pools during summer, when other water sources are scarce, than during spring. In addition, we explored the effect of water supplements on the desert bat community structure. Eight pools were installed in a date plantation in the hyper-arid Arava valley, Israel. Bats were acoustically monitored during three experimental stages: 1) before filling the pools with water; 2) while the pools held water and 3) after emptying them. The lesser date moth (Batrachedra amydraula), a major date pest, was monitored using pheromone traps in parallel with the experimental stages. We found that the pools increased bat activity in summer, but not in spring, while species richness was not affected in either season. The local bat community structure was significantly altered while the pools held water, but not due to increased activity of synanthropic Mediterranean species at the expense of local desert species. The number of individuals of the lesser date moth near the pools decreased with the increase in bat activity. Our results support the idea that seasonal water supplementation enhances bat activity in arid farmlands with potential contribution to pest control and the actual contribution to pest suppression should be further quantified. We suggest that the integration of small artificial pools to promote agricultural pest predation by bats may help reduce crop loss and potentially contribute to the conservation of desert bat communities by adding water sources.																			1049-9644	1090-2112				DEC	2023	187								105374	10.1016/j.biocontrol.2023.105374	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2023.105374													WOS:001094436500001

When roots encounter soil impedance, hormones are activated that affect cells and tissues, leading to changes in root morphology and configuration that often increase root penetration ability. Factors, such as root system architecture, root anatomic traits, rhizosphere exudation and root-induced phytohormones, influencing root penetration ability and how they affect plant performance under soil impedance were summarized. Root penetration ability affects plant capturing water and nutrients, and thus determines plant performance and productivity in adverse environments. Great efforts have been made in searching for the underlying mechanisms of root penetration ability, and tools have been developed for phenotyping variability in root penetration ability. Therefore, with the continued development of agroecosystems based on the advocated low input costs and controlled tillage, crops or genotypes of a crop species with stronger root penetration ability may have the potential for developing new varieties with enhanced adaptation and grain yield under mechanical impedance in soil.

Different disturbances may have some consistent effects on the soil microbial community, which remains largely unexplored. Methods We mimicked 16 anthropogenic disturbances in a steppe ecosystem, and measured the absolute abundance and taxonomic composition of soil bacterial communities with qPCR and amplicon sequencing, respectively. Results We found that while the absolute abundance of each of the four dominant bacterial phyla did not show a consistent response to these disturbances, that of the five subdominant phyla showed a consistent increase. Meanwhile, these disturbances consistently stimulated the relative abundances of metabolic functions for high-growth-yield, including the transport/metabolism of amino acids and carbohydrates. Stochastic processes (e.g., random birth) played more critical roles in structuring the subdominant than dominant phyla, and the disturbances promoted the stochastic processes. Conclusions Overall, the high-yield traits and stochasticity of subdominant phyla led to their positive responses to disturbances. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the intensifying human activities are likely to cause a high-yield-strategies-toward shift in soil microbial composition in the Eurasian steppe ecosystem.

Little attention, however, has been paid to LAI dynamics for shrub canopies in both arid and semiarid regions compared to forests and crops. One of the main sources of error when measuring shrub LAI from the indirect method is the woody part. The influence of woody parts on LAI estimations can be expressed as the woody-to-total area ratio, a; there are also relatively few studies on a value of shrubs, especially the dynamic changes of a. This study used a new cost-effective tool, the fisheye webcam, to derive daily LAI and a in the fields of Caragana korshinskii and Salix psammophila on the Loess Plateau in China. The LAI data were compared with measurements acquired by an LAI-2200 Plant Canopy Analyzer and direct methods. The LAI-2200 data were consistent with the effective plant area index (PAIeff) estimated using upwardpointing webcams (UPWs) (R-2 = 0.89, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.21) but not downward-pointing webcams (DPWs) (R-2 = 0.52, RMSE = 0.68). Shrub PAIeff derived from the DPWs was much smaller than PAIeff derived from the UPWs over the season (y = 0.48x-0.03, R-2 = 0.79, RMSE = 0.85). LAI derived from the direct methods was strongly linearly correlated with the PAI minus WAI obtained from upward digital hemispherical photography (R-2 = 0.94, RMSE = 0.62 for C. korshinskii and R-2 = 0.99, RMSE = 0.31 for S. psammophila). This result indicates that the upward digital hemispherical photography for deriving PAI and WAI performs good, which can be utilized to calculate LAI accurately. The woody-to-total area ratio (a) of deciduous shrub canopies was a dynamic parameter that varied throughout the season, decreasing as the canopy leaves developed and increasing when they fell. alpha = 1 for the leaf-off season and < 0.1 when the foliage peaked. a differed little between the two shrub canopies (R-2 = 0.95, RMSE = 0.07), and it could be used to convert PAI to LAI for C. korshinskii and S. psammophila. The UPWs demonstrated excellent potential for continuous LAI measurement for the two shrub canopies, but the DPWs should be further tested before use. The fisheye-webcam is inexpensive and can easily monitor LAI at field scale and can be used to evaluate LAI products derived from remote sensing.

The aim of this study was to assess the risk of drought-induced mortality for R. pseudoacacia plantations on the Loess Plateau based on plant hydraulics. We modified the routines of soil-plant-atmosphere water transfer in the Biome BioGeochemistry model (Biome-BGC) using a plant hydraulic model based on the supply-demand theory. The modified model efficiently captured the dynamics of canopy transpiration, soil moisture, leaf water potential, and regional variation in leaf area index in R. pseudoacacia stands on the Loess Plateau. We simulated the 50-year (1968-2017) plant hydraulic dynamics at 14 sites along a precipitation gradient on the Loess Plateau. The results indicated that annual average percentage loss of whole-plant hydraulic conductance (APLK) showed strong temporal variation due to climatic variability, which was positively correlated with annual potential evapotranspiration (PET) and the aridity index (the ratio of PET to annual precipitation). Along the precipitation gradient, the maximum APLK increased linearly with decreasing mean annual precipitation (MAP) and could exceed 60% at sites with MAP <446.1 mm. The sustainable growth of R. pseudoacacia plantations at these sites would face a severe threat. We analyzed the effect of soil desiccation on drought-induced mortality risk further. Soil desiccation increased the sensitivity of plant hydraulic safety to precipitation variability considerably, and the effect was more significant in areas with lower MAP. These quantitative findings should be helpful for evaluating and promoting the sustainability of plantation forests on the Loess Plateau.

Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-maize (Zea mays L.) (W-M) rotation is the dominant planting pattern in the Huang-HuaiHai Plain and is important for food security in China. However, the soil quality is deteriorating due to the W-M rotation's long-term, intensive, and continuous cultivation. Introducing legumes into the W-M rotation system may be an effective way to improve soil quality. In this study, we aimed to verify this hypothesis by exploring efficient planting systems (wheat-peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) (W-P) rotation and wheat rotated with maize and peanut intercropping (W-M/P)) to achieve higher agricultural production in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain. Using traditional W- M rotation as the control, we evaluated crop productivity, net returns, soil microorganisms (SMs), and soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions for three consecutive years. The results indicated that wheat yields were significantly increased under W-P and W-M/P (382.5-579.0 and 179.8-513.1 kg ha-1, respectively) compared with W-M. W-P and W-M/P provided significantly higher net returns (58.2 and 70.4%, respectively) than W-M. W-M/P and W-M retained the SOC stock more efficiently than W-P, increasing by 25.46-31.03 and 14.47-27.64%, respectively, in the 0-20 cm soil layer. Compared with W-M, W-M/P improved labile carbon fractions; the sensitivity index of potentially mineralizable carbon, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and dissolved organic carbon was 31.5, 96.5-157.2, and 17.8% in 20-40, 10-40, and 10-20 cm soil layers, respectively. The bacterial community composition and bacteria function were altered as per the soil depth and planting pattern. W-M/P and W-M exhibited similar bacterial community composition and function in 0-20 and 20-40 cm soil layers. Compared with W-P, a higher abundance of functional genes, namely, contains mobile elements and stress-tolerant, and a lower abundance of genes, namely, potentially pathogenic, were observed in the 10-20 cm soil layer of W-M and the 0-20 cm soil layer of W-M/P. SOC and MBC were the main factors affecting soil bacterial communities, positively correlated with Sphingomonadales and Gemmatimonadales and negatively correlated with Blastocatellales. Organic input was the main factor affecting SOC and SMs, which exhibited feedback effects on crop productivity. In summary, W-M/P improved productivity, net returns, and SOC pool compared with traditional W-M rotation systems, and it is recommended that plant-soil- microbial interactions be considered while designing high-yield cropping systems.

Visha; Bera, Anurag; Nath, Rajib			Modification in bio-physical properties of spring-summer black gram<i> [Vigna</i><i> mungo</i> (L.) Hepper] through optimization of sowing dates and nutrient management towards production sustainability	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Context or problem: Development and production of warm season food legumes are greatly influenced by the prevailing atmospheric temperature, soil moisture and radiation environments. Lack of soil moisture during reproductive stage due to rising atmospheric temperature during spring-summer (end of February to mid-March) is a great production barrier for black gram, a major warm season pulse crop of India. To sustain the growth and production of warm season pulse crops by addressing this specific issue, cobalt (Co), potassium (K) and boron (B) are potent plant nutrients. The lacuna of research on the impact of this unique nutrient schedule on black gram in Eastern India managing the dynamics of different bio-physical properties necessitated the initiation of this experiment.Objective or research question: The study was framed with an objective to analyse the impact of sowing dates and nutrient managements on growth, yield and bio-physical properties.Methods: A field experiment was carried out at the eastern Indian plains in spring-summer of 2020 and 2021 on black gram (variety: Pant Urd 31). The experiment was laid out in a split-split plot design with two sowing dates (main plot), Co application in soil (subplot) and single or combined foliar K and B spray (sub-sub plot) replicated thrice.Results: Black gram sown at March 1st week constantly outperformed the crop sown at March 3rd week with better soil moisture extraction irrespective of years. Dry matter accumulation and leaf area index (LAI) were significantly higher (p <= 0.05) with soil Co and foliar K+B applications, eventually accelerating the interception and use efficiency of photosynthetically active radiation (IPAR and PARUE respectively), seed yield and water use efficiency (WUE). Combined application of Co in soil with foliar K+B also facilitated heat and moisture stresses alleviation by reducing canopy temperature (Tc) and stress degree days index (SDDI) while escalating consumptive use (CU) of water. Changes in LAI had positive and linear correlation with IPAR during both years. Conclusions: Sowing in March 1st week in combination with basal soil Co application at 4 kg ha-1 and foliar K (1.25%) and B (0.2%) nutrition at flower initiation stage are exuberantly potent agronomic management to sustain optimum production potential of black gram through alleviation of abiotic stresses predominant during spring-summer seasons in Indian subtropics.Implications or significance: The combination of beneficial (Co), macro (K) and micro (B) nutrients under study was definitely a new potent area for the farmers to intensify the development and production of black gram by increasing radiation and water use efficiencies during spring-summer. Targeting higher black gram production through improvisation of resource use efficiencies with efficient utilization of these vital plant nutrients clearly depicted the novelty of this research within the domain of nutrient management studies.

This study assessed soil quality under soil erosion degradation using a novel optimal data set (ODS) approach and a comparative minimum data set (MDS) approach to derive soil quality indices (SQIs) within an agricultural watershed in Heilongjiang Province, China. The selection of SQIs was contingent on 15 physical, chemical, and microbial properties measured at 52 grids. Soil erosion rates were determined using the Cs-137 technique. Results showed that SQIs derived from the ODS and MDS approaches were strongly correlated (r = 0.91, p < 0.01). However, soil quality inferred by SQIs varied significantly between erosion and deposition sites, namely, increasing from upstream to midstream to downstream areas. Changes in SQIs and erosion rates exhibited spatially opposing trends, reflecting the impact of soil erosion on soil quality, which was also confirmed by comparing representative soil properties at erosion and deposition sites. The ODS approach using the optimal fingerprinting factor screening procedure of the composite fingerprinting approach is a cause-related method that uses a relatively strict indicator selection procedure, which mainly includes sample groupings, Kruskal-Wallis H test, discriminant function analysis, and conservative behaviour tests of factors. Thus, it can theoretically obtain more reliable results compared to MDS. Further studies are nevertheless needed to assess the feasibility of this novel approach in other cases.

However, most researchers have focused on FM during the growth period of winter wheat; as such, a knowledge gap remains regarding FM in other periods. Accordingly, we established a long-term field experiment in 2002 that included four treatments on the Loess Plateau of China. These four treatments included the following: regular fertilization without film (NP), regular fertilization with FM in the fallow period (NPFF), regular fertilization with FM in the growth period (NPFG), regular fertilization with FM for the whole year (NPFW). In 2020 - 2021, we measured the soil water distribution and root distribution in the 0 - 200 cm profile; the soil temperature in 5, 15, 30, and 50 cm soil layers; the winter wheat grain yield; the water use efficiency (WUE); and rainfall use efficiency (RUE). Our results demonstrated that compared with NP, the winter wheat yield of NPFF, NPFG, and NPFW improved by 37.1%, 7.8%, and 21.3% (p < 0.05). The WUE of NPFF, NPFG, and NPFW was 29.5%, 14.3%, and 12.5% higher than NP. Additionally, the RUE of NPFF, NPFG, and NPFW was 37.8%, 8.9%, and 22.2% higher than NP. The profile's annual average soil temperature of NPFF, NPFG, and NPFW were 0.6 degrees C, 1.0 degrees C, and 1.4 degrees C higher than NP. Further, the root mass of NPFF, NPFG, and NPFW were 16.7%, 41.7%, and 8.3% higher than NP, respectively, and the root mass percentage of NPFF, NPFG, and NPFW decreased significantly by 7.3%, 6.0%, and 24.8% less than NP, respectively, in the 0 - 40 cm soil layer (p < 0.05). In sum, FM during the fallow period was considered an appropriate yield increase measure on the Loess Plateau of China and similar regions because of its advantages in collecting precipitation during the fallow period, regulating wheat growth temperature, and obtaining high yields.

Extensive use of chemicals in conventional agricultural practices has resulted in continuous and serious environmental pollution. Flurochloridone (FLC) is a monophenyl pyrrolidinone selective herbicide that is commonly used to inhibit weeds that occur during the growth of potatoes. In recent years, research on the toxicity of FLC has gradually increased. However, it is relatively rare to analyze the role of FLC by studying the composition of soil microorganisms. Therefore, we used NGS methods to identify the fungal community structure of the low content soil (LS) and high content soil (HS) samples in this study. Subsequently, we identified the fungal community and composition differences of these two group samples using the statistical analysis. Despite the variances of fungal community and composition across the different samples within the group, the fungal composition of the LS samples and the HS samples. LS samples were predominated by Ascomycota, while the HS samples were predominated by Mortierellomycota and Basidiomycota. The major species in the LS samples were Plectosphaerella cucumerina and Trichocladium asperum, whereas the dominant species in the HS samples were Epicoccum nigrum and Cladosporium chasmanthicola. These results suggested that the LS samples and the HS samples had different rhizosphere soil fungal community and composition changes resulting from implementation of FLC in potato growing areas.

The effects of N, P, and K levels on agronomic traits were analyzed during the jointing, heading, and filling stages. JG21 performed optimally under treatment with N160P90K150 (T-6); the yield and fat content increased by 49.32% and 13% compared to the control. Correlation analysis revealed that N was significantly positively (negatively) correlated with the protein (amylose) content. P was significantly positively correlated with the fat and moisture content and K was correlated with the moisture, fat, and protein content, but was negatively with the amylose content. Overall, rational ratios of NPK fertilization improved foxtail millet yield and quality. Based on fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, the T-6 treatment (N160P90K150) demonstrated the highest comprehensive effect among 13 NPK fertilizer combinations. Rational application of NPK in foxtail millet may improve agronomic performance by enhancing leaf photosynthetic efficiency and aboveground biomass accumulation.																				2073-4395				AUG	2023	13	8							2005	10.3390/agronomy13082005	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13082005													WOS:001056527700001

Ascertaining the vertical distribution and transportation of soil moisture under different vegetation types has a profound effect on the ecological construction. In this study, the soil moisture at a depth of 500 cm for four typical vegetation types, including Robinia pseudoacacia, Caragana korshinskii, Stipa bungeana, and corn, were investigated and compared in the Zhifanggou watershed of the Loess plateau. Additionally, hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes were detected to identify the transport mechanism of soil moisture. The results showed vertical distribution and transportation of soil moisture were different under different vegetation types. Depth-averaged soil moisture under S. bungeana and corn generally increased along the profile, while C. korshinskii and R. pseudoacacia showed weakly increasing and relatively stable after an obvious decreasing trend (0-40 cm). The soil moisture under R. pseudoacacia was lower than that under other vegetation types, especially in deep layer. However, the effect of R. pseudoacacia on soil moisture in the topsoil (< 30 cm) could be positive. For R. pseudoacacia (160-500 cm), C. korshinskii (0-500 cm), and S. bungeana (0-100 cm), the soil moisture declined with increased in vegetation age. Planting arbor species such as R. pseudoacacia intensified the decline of soil moisture on the Loess Plateau. The capacity of evaporation fractionation of soil moisture followed the sequence: corn > S. bungeana > R. pseudoacacia > C. korshinskii. The delta O-18 values in soil water fluctuated across the profile. The delta O-18 values changed sharply in upper layer and generally remained stable in deep layer. However, in middle layer, the vertical distribution characteristics of the delta O-18 values were different under different vegetation types. We estimated that piston flow was the main mode of precipitation infiltration, and the occurrence of preferential flow was related to vegetation types. These results were helpful to improve the understanding of the response of deep soil moisture to vegetation restoration and inform practices for sustainable water management.					; Gao, Peng/K-7487-2014	Qiu, dexun/0000-0002-2983-7280; Gao, Peng/0000-0002-4723-4256													0885-6087	1099-1085				OCT	2021	35	10							e14397	10.1002/hyp.14397	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14397													WOS:000711813100007

Accordingly, we hypothesized that insects in desert environments may evolve associations with gut bacteria to adapt to the extremely low nutrient availability. For this, we conducted a systematic survey of bacterial communities in the guts of weevils developing inside mud chambers affixed to plant roots in the Negev Desert of Israel, based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Results: Our analyses revealed that gut bacterial communities in weevil larvae were similar across a wide geographical range, but differed significantly from those of the mud chambers and of the surrounding soils. Nevertheless, a high proportion of bacteria (including all of the core bacteria) found in the weevils were also detected in the mud chambers and soils at low relative abundances. The genus Citrobacter (of the Enterobacteriaceae family) was the predominant group in the guts of all individual weevils. The relative abundance of Citrobacter significantly decreased at the pupal and adult stages, while bacterial diversity increased. A mini literature survey revealed that members of the genus Citrobacter are associated with nitrogen fixation, recycling of uric acid nitrogen, and cellulose degradation in different insects. Conclusions: The results suggest that although weevils could potentially acquire their gut bacteria from the soil, weevil host internal factors, rather than external environmental factors, were more important in shaping their gut bacterial communities, and suggest a major role for Citrobacter in weevil nutrition in this challenging environment. This study highlights the potential involvement of gut bacteria in the adaptation of insects to nutritional deficiencies under extreme desert conditions.

Few studies have evaluated the effects of land use on the distribution and morphology of rills under extreme rainstorms. A total of 50 rill survey sites were selected in a typical watershed of the Loess Plateau of China to investigate the rill distribution and morphology of three land uses (fallow land, FL; slope farmland, SF; and annual grassland, AG) under extreme rainstorm conditions (called "7.26" rainstorm). Seven parameters (rill width, rill depth, width-depth ratio, cross-section area, rill density, degree of rill dissection and rill erosion modulus) were used to characterize rill morphology, and the basic soil and vegetation properties (bulk density, particle size distribution, and vegetation coverage) and topographic factors (slope length, gradient, direction) were measured. It was found that rills developed on three land uses, and those with widths ranging from 5 to 20 cm accounted for >80%. Rills developed on FL were deeper than those on SF and AG. Almost all rills on FL had a depth of 5-20 cm (90.3%), while the depth of rills on SF and AG were mainly smaller than 15 cm (91.5% and 91.9%, respectively). In addition to width, rill depth and cross-section area of SF and AG were also significantly less than those of FL. SF and FL had a relatively high width-depth ratio and dissection degree. However, land use had no significant effect on rill density. Crop plantations (SF) and grass restoration (AG) significantly reduced rill erosion modulus (28.70% and 45.07% reduction, respectively). Land use, topography, soil, and vegetation factors significantly affected rill morphology (p = 0.001) based on redundancy analysis (RDA) and can explain 48.0% of the total variability of rill morphology, with slope length, vegetation coverage and slope gradient having the greatest influences. Most of the rill morphological parameters significantly decreased as the vegetation coverage increased but they significantly increased with increasing slope length and slope gradient. This study clearly illustrates the severe rill erosion caused by this rainstorm, and indirectly indicates that crop harvesting (FL) aggravates rill erosion and that revegetation (AG) can effectively contain rill erosion. Therefore, rehabilitation efforts should be focused on revegetation (grassland and/or woodland) on steep slopes to control soil erosion. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To estimate the effects of desertification on the C, N, and P concentrations and C:N:P stoichiometry of plants and soil, we examined C, N, and P concentrations in plant tissues (leaves, roots and litter) and soil across five degrees of desertification in the desert grassland of Ningxia, China (control, light, moderate, severe and very severe desertification stages). The C, N, and P concentrations and C:N:P stoichiometry of the leaves, roots and litter differed among the different desertification stages. Desertification resulted in opposing trends between the leaf N concentration and leaf C:N ratio. With the exception of the very severe desertification stage, the leaf N:P ratio decreased over the process of grassland desertification. The soil C, N, and P concentrations and soil N:P and C:P ratios decreased significantly along the grassland desertification gradient. In contrast, the soil C:N ratio remained relatively stable during desertification (10.85 to 11.48). The results indicate that desertification is unfavourable to C and N fixation and has a negative effect on the ecosystem structure and function of desert grassland.					keesstra, saskia/Z-5477-2019														2045-2322					JUL 1	2019	9								9422	10.1038/s41598-019-45927-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-45927-0								31263198					WOS:000473294100009

There is considerable uncertainty regarding the direction and magnitude of the responses of this process to precipitation changes, hindering accurate prediction of C cycling in a changing world. We examined the responses of ecosystem CO2 flux to ambient precipitation and experimentally decreased (-35%) and increased precipitation (+20%) in a semiarid grassland in China between July 2013 and September 2015. The measured CO2 flux components included the gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (Re), and soil respiration (Rs). The results showed that the seasonal and diurnal patterns of most components of ecosystem CO2 flux were minimally affected by precipitation treatments, with less than 4% changes averaged across the three growing seasons. GEP and NEE had a quadratic relationship, while Re and Rs increased exponentially with soil temperature. GEP, RE, and Rs, however, decreased with soil moisture. Decreased precipitation reduced the dependence of CO2 flux on soil temperature but partly increased the dependence on soil moisture; in contrast, increased precipitation had the opposite influence. Our results suggested a relatively stable CO2 flux in this semiarid grassland across the tested precipitation regimes.

However, few studies have tested effects of RP on UH and soil over a large-scale area of the Loess Plateau. Methods The study area consisted of three vegetation zones (the steppe, forest-steppe and forest zone). Two canopy plant types were selected: RP stands and adjacent native vegetation. We measured five leaf functional traits: leaf carbon content (LC), leaf nitrogen content (LN), leaf phosphorus content (LP), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf tissue density (LTD). The functional diversity, species diversity and community-weighted mean (CWM) traits were calculated. Important Findings (i) CWM.LN, CWM.LP and CWM.SLA increased significantly, whereas CWM.LC and CWM.LTD decreased significantly in the three vegetation zones, compared with the native communities. (ii) Species diversity, functional diversity and community biomass decreased in the steppe zone, increased in the forest zone, and did not differ significantly in the forest-steppe zone. (iii) We found only soil organic carbon (P < 0.05) and soil total nitrogen (P < 0.05) in the forest zone decreased significantly compared with the native plots. (iv) The relationship between UH and soil properties was affected by RP and the vegetation zone. Overall, the effect of RP on UH and soil properties was associated with the vegetation zone. This result is of great significance to the planning of restoration and reconstruction of artificial forests in the Loess Plateau.

In the vegetable fields in China both inorganic and organic fertilizers are largely applied as basic sources of nitrogen. Identifying the effects of fertilizer type on soil microbial activities involved in N2O emissions would be of great help for future development of N2O reduction strategies. N2O isotopocule deltas, including delta N-15(bu)lk, delta O-1(8) and SP (the N-15 site preference in N2O), have been used to analyze microbial pathways of N2O production under different treatments, including bio-organic fertilizer treatment, half bio-organic fertilizer and half urea (mixed fertilizer) treatment, urea treatment and no fertilizer treatment. We measured environmental factors, N2O fluxes and N2O isotopocule deltas to evaluate the dynamics of N2O emissions and constructed the dual isotopocule plots (delta N-15(bu)lk vs. SP and delta O-18 vs. SP) of the main N2O emission phases to assess contribution of the involved microbial processes (bacterial nitrification, bacterial denitrification, nitrifier denitrification and fungal denitrification). According to the results of the main N2O emission phases, we found that bio-organic fertilizer and mix fertilizer treatments had significantly lower N2O emissions compared to urea treatment, with average N2O fluxes of 1477 +/- 204, 1243 +/- 187 and 1941 +/- 164 mu g m(-3) h(-1), respectively, but there were no significant effects on mineral N and cabbage yield. In addition, the urea treatment and the mixed fertilizer treatment had close and higher nitrogen use efficiency. Furthermore, the delta O-18 vs. SP plot was useful for providing insight into microbial processes, showing that fungal denitrification/bacterial nitrification was the dominant microbial pathway and bio-organic fertilizer and mix fertilizer treatments had higher denitrification and N2O reduction compared to urea treatment. Those findings demonstrated that the partial replacement of urea with bio-organic fertilizer was a better choice, by means of enhancing denitrification to reduce N2O emissions and also guaranteeing the nitrogen use efficiency and the cabbage yield.

However, the sensitivity of shallow mass movements on gully slopes to topography is poorly understood. Here, a series of rainfall simulation experiments was performed to quantitatively explore the influences of slope height (1.0 and 1.5 m) and gradient (60 degrees and 70 degrees) on shallow mass movements on the natural loess slopes on the Loess Plateau. Our research observed shallow mass movement processes on undisturbed slopes by using a Topography Meter and collected data that well reflected the nature of the processes. The conducted study has advantageous over traditional methods that are usually used in laboratory tests of backfilled soil. Results showed that the amount of shallow mass movement increased with increased slope height and gradient. The shallow mass movement rates (i.e., gravity erosion rates) increased by approximately 3-8 times with increased slope height from 1.0 m to 1.5 m, and increased by 148%-525% with increased slope gradient from 60 degrees to 70 degrees. The sensitivity coefficient of slope gradients for shallow mass movements was 2.1 times larger than that of slope heights for the shallow mass movements. Slope heights had the greatest effect on earthflow relative to slide and avalanche, whereas slope gradients had the greatest effect on slide. Our results provided insights into natural hazard susceptibility assessment and control erosion processes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

MGDG synthase (MGD) is the key enzyme responsible for MGDG synthesis in plants. However, so far, the function of the MGD gene in plant stress responses is still unknown, especially in crop plants. In this study, the performances of wild-type rice (Oryza sativa L. Nipponbare), OsMGD overexpression, and RNA interference lines were analyzed under salt stress to clarify the role of OsMGD in rice under salt stress. The results showed that, after 6 days of NaCl treatment, OsMGD-overexpressing rice seedlings had higher biomass than the wild-type rice, with significantly lower Na+ content and Na+ to K+ ratio in the shoots. Meanwhile, overexpression lines showed a significant increase in the contents of chlorophyll a and carotenoid and photosynthetic capabilities, including the net photosynthetic rate, maximal quantum yield (Fv/Fm), effective PSII quantum yield (Phi(PSII)), electron transport rate (ETR), and coefficient of photochemical quenching (qP), compared with the wild-type line. Also, OsMGD overexpression lines contained higher MGDG and 18:3 unsaturated fatty acid levels under salt stress. These results indicate that OsMGD participates in the regulation of improving salt tolerance through protecting photosynthetic capabilities and ion balance in rice.

However, knowledge regarding the influence of root exudates on soil communities, particularly concerning their assembly processes and species coexistence patterns, remains limited. In this study, we performed a 20-month pot experiment using a nitrogen (N) addition gradient (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, and 15 g N m(-2) yr(-1)), amplicon sequencing, and metabolomics to investigate the effect of short-term N addition on the assembly process and species coexistence of fungal communities, as well as their association with root exudates in the rhizosphere and bulk soils around Bothriochloa ischaemum. The results demonstrated that short-term N addition led to distinct differences in the diversity, composition, assembly process, and co-occurrence networks of fungal communities in the rhizosphere and bulk soils. The diversity of fungal communities in the rhizosphere soil increased with the rate of N input and peaked at N10 treatment; this could be correlated with the increased abundance in long-chain organic acids (LCOAs). However, above the threshold N rate of 10 g N m(-2) yr(-1), diversity decreased probably because of the high N-induced inhibitory effect on root exudates (i.e., LCOAs). N addition increased the relative abundance of Sordariomycetes in the rhizosphere and decreased the relative abundance of Mortierellomycetes in the bulk soil, while enhancing the abundance of pathotrophs in both bulk and rhizosphere soils. The rhizosphere fungal community was dominated by a stochastic process at a low N input (N0 and N2.5) and by deterministic processes at a high N input (N10 and N15), which is opposite to the trends in the bulk soil. These fungal assembly processes determine the coexistence of fungal species; deterministic processes lead to less interconnected networks in rhizosphere soils that harbor a more complex network than the bulk soil. Associations between the assembly process and species coexistence in the rhizosphere of B. ischaemum were closely related to the changes in root exudates, such as amino acids, short-chain organic acids, and phenols, which were stimulated by N addition. Collectively, our study emphasizes the key roles of root exudates in the establishment of fungal communities in the plant soil system and furthers our understanding of plant-microbe interactions.

Zhonglan No. 2 (Medicago sativa L. cv. Zhonglan No. 2) is a new breeding alfalfa cultivar characterized by high drought tolerance and high yield. To determine the optimum time for utilization of Zhonglan No. 2, we examined growth traits, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic and fluorescence parameters, and composition and nutritive values at the late vegetative and early flowering stages of the first stubble in the second, third, fourth, sixth, and eleventh years after planting. RESULTS In general, the height and leaf area decreased with increasing number of years after planting. At the late vegetative stage, the fourth-year alfalfa exhibited higher stomatal conductance (Gs) and intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), and better water use efficiency, and at the early flowering stage, the fourth-year alfalfa had the highest (P < 0.05) leaf net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and carboxylation efficiency (CE). Total digestible nutrients did not differ among years, but, in the early flowering stage, crude protein content decreased with years (P < 0.05). Malondialdehyde (MDA) content and total antioxidant capacity did not differ among years after planting, suggesting aging did not impose oxidative stress on this alfalfa cultivar. CONCLUSIONS Based on height, chlorophyll content, crude protein (CP) content, and photosynthetic and fluorescence parameters, the fourth year after planting, at the early flowering stage, was the best for using Zhonglan No. 2.

However, this phenomenon in alpine ecosystems remains largely untested. Methods: We conducted an 8-year nitrogen deposition experiment on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, with four nitrogen deposition rates of 10 (atmospheric deposition), 20, 30, and 50 kg ha(-1) year(-1). Results: The abundances of two nitrifying genes and four denitrifying genes and the N2O emission rate initially increased and subsequently decreased as the nitrogen deposition rate increased.

The major downstream ion contents were greater than the corresponding upstream values and the ion content in streamflow during the wet season is much higher than that during the dry season. The water quality during the wet season was unsatisfactory as approximately one third of the water samples were categorized as the worst water quality based on excessive nitrates and carbonate weathering. Rock weathering contributed the greatest proportion of solutes to both streamflow and groundwater. Evaporite dissolution and carbonate weathering dominated solutes in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. Human activities cannot be ignored in certain areas. Fertilizer application accounts for 43% of the total anthropogenic solute inputs. These results point to the increasing impact of agriculture on water quality. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Cultivated in the Arid Region of Southern Tunisia	CHEMISTRY & BIODIVERSITY												Pea (Pisum sativum L.) is an important legume for human and animal consumption, cultivated in many temperate regions of the world. In the present investigation, the seeds of twelve pea accessions collected from the arid regions of southern Tunisia, characterized by different colors of flowers and seed coats, were evaluated for their proteins, phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities. The protein content determined by the Bradford method ranged from 46.91 to 151.08 mg/g DW. The content of total phenol, total flavonoid and condensed tannin, ranging from 36.85 to 102.52 mg GAE/100 g DW, 6.95 to 48.11 mg QE/100 g DW, and 12.37 to 70.43 mg CE/100 g DW, respectively. These parameters were characterized respectively by the following three methods, the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, the aluminum chloride and the vanillin assay. The LC-ESI/MS analysis identified the presence of 8 phenolic acids and 9 flavonoids which quinic acid, protocatechuic acid, hyperoside, and quercetin-3-O-rhamnosidewere detected as the most abundant compounds. Moreover, the antioxidant activity of pea seeds was evaluated by the ABTS+and DPPH tests. Indeed, DPPH and ABTS anti-free radical activity values ranged from 1.92 to 14.11 mu moL TEAC/g DW and 2.3 to 14.95 mu moL TEAC/g DW, respectively. The variability across the assessed traits revealed significant differences as computed by ANOVA tests. Else, the results showed significant correlations between seed coat color, seed shape, flower color and phenolic compounds. Therefore, genotypes characterized by a purple flower, brown seed coat, and wrinkled form had the highest levels of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity. Correlation analysis revealed that phenolic compounds presented a strong positive correlation with antioxidant activities, while being negatively correlated with protein content. UPGMA cluster and Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed two main groups. This work highlights the nutritional value of P. sativum seeds as a good source of natural antioxidant compounds that may be useful in the food and pharmaceutical industries.

Here 15 RoSPLs were identified in Rubus occidentalis. The conserved domains and motifs, phylogenetic relationships, posttranscriptional regulation, and physiological function of the 92 SPL family genes in Fragaria vesca, Malus domestica, Prunus persica, R. occidentalis, and Pyrus pyrifolia were analyzed. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed the SPL proteins had sequence conservation, some FvSPLs could be lost or developed, and there was a closer relationship between M. domestica and P. pyrifolia, F. vesca and R. occidentalis, respectively. Genes with similar motifs clustering together in the same group had their functional redundancy. Based on the function of SPLs in Arabidopsis thaliana, these SPLs could be involved in vegetative transition from juvenile to adult, morphological change in the reproductive phase, anthocyanin biosynthesis, and defense stress. Forty-eight SPLs had complementary sequences of miR156, of which nine PrpSPLs in P. persica and eight RoSPLs in R. occidentalis as the potential targets of miR156 were reported for the first time, suggesting the conservative regulatory effects of miR156 and indicating the roles of miR156-SPL modules in plant growth, development, and defense response. It provides a basic understanding of SPLs in Rosaceae plants.					li, heqin/AAN-9429-2020														2391-5412						2021	16	1					160	171		10.1515/biol-2021-0020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biol-2021-0020								33817308					WOS:000620654700001

The aims of this study were to determine and identify the differentially abundant proteins and adaptive mechanisms to alkali tolerance between young and old leaves of cotton. The 4704 proteins were identified, in which 1490 were significantly changed in young leaves and 563 were changed in old leaves in response to alkali stress. The differentially abundant proteins were classified into 10 functional categories in the young leaves, and only 3 functional categories were involved in the old leaves. In the photoreaction system, the accumulations of differential proteins, especially Psb proteins, were higher in young leaves than in old leaves. Compared with old leaves, the carbon metabolism was enhanced significantly through an increased chlorophyll content and increased expression of key proteins for carbon metabolism in young leaves. Furthermore, alkali stress revealed more complex effects on the nitrogen metabolism in young leaves than that in old leaves. Our results demonstrated that during adaptation of cotton to alkali stress, young and old leaves have distinct mechanisms of molecular metabolism regulation. The metabolic flexibility was more remarkable in young leaves than in old leaves; therefore, the alkali tolerance of young leaves is more efficient. These data will increase our understanding of alkali-tolerant mechanisms in higher plants.																			0981-9428	1873-2690				AUG	2019	141						370	379		10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.06.019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.06.019								31212241					WOS:000475997300037

The current status of land degradation and changing trends of land remain unclear on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). This study integrated an Optimal Land Degradation Index (OLDI) and spatial footprints of three land degradation pathways (i.e., salini-zation, desertification and soil erosion) to investigate changing trends and degradation risks from 2001 to 2021 on the QTP. The results showed that land improvements were the dominant changing trends on the QTP compared to land degradation, accounting for 18.83% of the whole plateau. The regions with land improvements were mainly distributed in the northeastern QTP. High-risk degraded land covered an area of 0.55 million km2, and low-risk degraded land covered 0.78 million km2. The spatial distribution of high-risk degraded land varied gradually from scattered small areas to increasingly frequent connected patches from southeast to northwest. Potential driving factor analysis illustrated that land degradation resulted from multidimensional driving forc-ings, including topography, climatic factors, and human activities. The findings in this study can provide great insight for alpine ecosystem development and make adaption to achieve carbon neutrality with global warming.

However, the influencing mech-anism of revegetation on the soil properties of the gully head (GHSP) is still unclear. Thus, this study hypothesized that the variations in the GHSP were influenced by vegetation diversity during nature revegetation, and the influence path-ways were mainly root traits, aboveground dry biomass (ADB), and vegetation coverage (VC). We studied six grassland communities of the gully head with different natural revegetation ages. The findings showed that the GHSP were im-proved during 22-year revegetation. The interaction effect of vegetation diversity, roots, aboveground dry biomass, and vegetation coverage on the GHSP was 43 %. In addition, vegetation diversity significantly explained >70.3 % of the changes in the root traits, ADB, and VC of the gully head (P < 0.05). Therefore, we combined vegetation diversity, roots, ADB, and VC to establish the path model to explain the GHSP changes, and the goodness of fit of the model was 82.3 %. The results showed that the model explained 96.1 % of the variation in the GHSP, and the vegetation diversity of the gully head affected the GHSP through roots, ADB, and VC. Therefore, during nature revegetation, vegetation di-versity dominates the improvement of the GHSP, which has important significance for designing an optimal vegetation restoration strategy to control gully erosion.					chen, zhuoxin/ABH-4099-2020	chen, zhuoxin/0000-0002-8673-0498													0048-9697	1879-1026				SEP 1	2023	889								164214	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164214	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164214		MAY 2023						37209737					WOS:001022308500001

Biological soil crusts (biocrusts), which cover approximately 40% of the open soil surface in frozen soil regions, exert great impacts on soil temperatures. However, little attention has been given to the potential effects of biocrusts on the temperature characteristics, dynamics and freezing duration of soil in frozen soil regions. To provide more insight into this issue, an automatic system was used to monitor soil temperatures and dynamics at depths of 5, 30, 50 and 100 cm beneath bare soil and two types of biocrustal soils (soils covered with two types of biocrusts) on the QTP of China. The results showed that biocrusts play an important role in controlling the dynamics of soil temperatures. Biocrusts cause a 0.6-1 degrees C decrease in the mean annual temperature of soils down to a depth of 100 cm. The extent of the decrease in soil temperature was dependent on biocrust type, and dark biocrust showed a greater reduction in soil temperature than light biocrust. In addition, reductions in soil temperatures of biocrusts mainly occurred in daytimes of the thawing period, and this prolonged the freezing duration in the top 100 cm by approximately 10-20 days. The results of this study indicate that biocrusts maintain lower temperatures in the thawing period and slow the thawing of frozen soil in the spring, which helps to maintain the stability of the frozen soil. This information may aid understanding of the function of biocrusts in the frozen soil regions under global warming conditions.																			0016-7061	1872-6259				MAR 1	2022	409								115655	10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115655	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115655													WOS:000788135400001

Rather than maximizing water use efficiency, this scheme aims to maximize net income. The volumetric water price is considered to give farmers an incentive to save irrigation water. A field experiment for soybeans was carried out in the Arid Land Research Center, Tottori University, Japan in 2019. The total irrigation amount yield and net income by the proposed scheme were compared to those by a tensiometer-operated automated irrigation. The scheme could save irrigation water by 16% with a yield increment of 20%; resulting in a 22% increase in net income compared to the automated irrigation. The model simulated the volumetric water content in the effective root zone of the plant in fair agreement. These results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme that may replace an automated irrigation system even considering uncertainty in weather forecast to determine irrigation depth and secure investment costs.

Here, we investigated their role in response of Phaseolus vulgaris and Pisum sativum, representing ureide and amide legumes, respectively, to Cd toxicity.MethodsFirst, ureide content and ureide metabolism in P. vulgaris and P. sativum grown under control conditions and treated with 50 & mu;M CdCl2 for 48 hours was investigated. Then, the effect of exogenous allantoin and its precursor, uric acid, on Cd-related oxidative lesion was examined in both legumes.ResultsCd increased the content of both ureides only in the leaves of P. vulgaris, which was consistent with transcript levels and activity of ureide metabolic enzymes, and was accompanied by an increase in uric acid content. In P. sativum leaves, Cd increased the activity of ureide biosynthesis enzymes and decreased the activity of ureide degradation enzymes, although the uric acid content did not change, while the allantoin and allantoate contents were significantly reduced. Exogenous uric acid and allantoin suppressed Cd-induced H2O2 and O-2 accumulation and alleviated the effects of oxidative damage measured by RNA degradation, chlorophyll and malondialdehyde content in both legumes.ConclusionsP. sativum use allantoin and uric acid as antioxidant agents to mitigate Cd-related oxidative tissue damage. In P. vulgaris, the involvement of the ureide pathway in Cd-induced N salvage and recycling is rather a priority.

We identify a saddle-node-infinite-period bifurcation of fronts that leads to episodic front propagation in the parameter region below propagation failure and show that this state is stable. Stable constant speed fronts exist only above this parameter value. We use numerical continuation to show that propagation failure is a consequence of the presence of a T-point corresponding to the formation of a heteroclinic cycle in a spatial dynamics description. Additional T-points are identified that are responsible for a large multiplicity of different unstable traveling front-peak states. The results indicate that multivariable models may support new types of behavior that are absent from typical two-variable models but may nevertheless be important in developmental processes such as branching and somitogenesis.

However, there are few reports on the application of extracellular enzyme stoichiometry (EES) method to study the difference in microbial metabolic nutrient limitation between rhizosphere and bulk soil. Here, we choose the rhizosphere and bulk soils of Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica (P. sylvestris) plantations with five stand ages in the Mu Us sandy land, and analyzed the variation and differences of microbial metabolic limitation between rhizosphere and bulk soils with stand age by EES method. The results showed that the microbial metabolic C-limitation in the rhizosphere and bulk soil gradually increased with stand age. Almost all the vector angles were less than 45 degrees, which indicated that the soil microbial metabolism was relatively limited by N rather than P. Furthermore, the microbial C- and N-limitation in rhizosphere soils were generally stronger than bulk soils. Soil physical properties (59.73%) explained most of the variations in soil EES based on the variationpartitioning analysis, followed by total nutrients (43.00%). The partial least squares path model suggested that the main driving factor for the variation of soil microbial metabolic C-limitation in the rhizosphere and bulk soils was physical properties, while the microbial N-limitation was for total nutrients. In general, the study emphasized the application of EES methods to assess the dynamic equilibrium between soil microbial resource acquisition and nutrient availability in desert ecosystems. These insights provide guidance for formulating afforestation strategies, such as nutrient management of sandy plantations.																			0301-4797	1095-8630				FEB 1	2022	303								114215	10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.114215	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.114215		DEC 2021						34864590					WOS:000732996500004

Soil internal forces (SIFs), including electrostatic, hydration, and van der Waals forces, can substantially affect aggregate stability; however, there has been relatively little focus on the effects of biochar addition on SIFs and their relation to aggregate stability. In this work, in order to quantitatively investigate the influence of biochar on aggregate stability, we collected soil samples with different biochar application rates (0, 2.5%, 5.5%, and 7.0%; w/w) after a two-year field experiment, and then used Na+-saturated soil aggregates (1-5 mm) to conduct our experiments. Our results demonstrated that after 2-year, specific surface area (SSA), soil organic carbon (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and surface charge density (sigma(0)) increased while soil pH slightly decreased with biochar application from 0% to 7%. Soil aggregate stability increased with the biochar application rate. Theoretical calculations indicated that forces of electrostatic repulsion and van der Waals attraction both increased in response to biochar incorporation, however the net pressure of SIFs decreased. Soil aggregate stability was well explained by the theoretical calculations. Biochar addition reduced the net pressure of SIFs and stabilized soil aggregates. Overall, the investigation by using the mono-cationic model system showed that SIFs played important roles in the aggregate stability and explained well the aggregate stability of amended soils. The findings of this work initiate the process of elucidating and quantifying the complex biochar-mineral interaction mechanism in soil systems.																			0016-7061	1872-6259				DEC 1	2021	403								115276	10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115276	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115276		JUN 2021											WOS:000671591200024

The storage characteristics of 55 common herbaceous species and their relationships with plant morphology, biomass-related traits, and leaf wettability were examined using artificial wetting method in semiarid Loess Plateau. Results indicated that plant mass storage ranged from 0.12-1.26 g g(-1), and Glycyrrhiza uralensis and Leymus secalinus had the highest and lowest values, respectively. Leaf storage ratio ranged from 40.2-93.2%, with the highest value in G. uralensis and the lowest in Chenopodium album. Fifty-two species had higher storage capacities in leaves than that in stems. Gramineous and leguminous species had relatively lower mass storage and leaf storage ratio than compositae and rosaceae. Plant and leaf mass storage were negatively correlated with leaf adaxial/abaxial contact angles, and stem mass storage was negatively correlated with plant height. Storage capacities were closely related to morphological and biomass-related traits, and leaf area was a better predictor of plant and leaf storage capacities, and stem fresh weight was a better predictor at the stem level. Path analysis revealed that leaf area and adaxial contact angle were two independent variables directly affecting plant and leaf storage capacities. Their ratio (i.e., wettability index) had higher correlations with storage capacities than other single trait and multiple regression models of these traits. Our results implied that high proportions of gramineous and leguminous species in grassland community would favour reducing interception loss, and wettability index can be an effective indicator for evaluating rainfall interception and vegetation hydrological benefits.

However, the evaluation of the long-term effects of a subsoiling and plowing yearly rotation in a crop residue retention cropping system is lacking. Therefore, a 12-year (2007-2019) experiment was established to evaluate the influence of a subsoiling and plowing rotation with residue retention on water-stable aggregates (WSA), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) storage, and crop yield in a winter wheat-spring maize rotation field. Tillage treatment was 1-year subsoiling and 1-year plowing rotation (ST/CT), and continuous subsoiling (ST) and plowing (CT) were used as controls. During the 12-year experiment, the ST/CT rotation reduced the mean C input of winter wheat (5.4%) and spring maize (1.7%) at harvest compared with the ST treatment but significantly improved the mean C input of winter wheat (6.2%) and spring maize (10.9%) at harvest compared with the CT treatment. After 12 years of the experiment (2019), the ST/CT rotation significantly increased water-stable macroaggregates (6.6% and 7.7%) at 0-40 cm compared with the ST and CT treatments, respectively. In addition, the ST/CT rotation had a lower SOC (0.11 Mg.ha(-1)) and N (0.16 Mg & BULL;ha? 1) storage at the 0-10 cm soil depth than the ST treatment. However, the ST/CT rotation had a higher SOC (0.51 and 2.77 Mg.a(-1)) and N storage (0.11 and 0.18 Mg.ha(-1)) at the 10-20 and 20-40 cm soil depths than the ST treatment. When compared to the CT treatment, the ST/CT rotation significantly improved SOC and N storage at 0-10 cm (4.24 and 0.18 Mg & BULL;ha? 1), 10-20 cm (0.50 and 0.14 Mg & BULL;ha? 1), and 20-40 cm (2.66 and 0.22 Mg & BULL;ha? 1), respectively. Additionally, the ST/CT rotation also significantly enhanced the yield of winter wheat (5.6% and 10.5%) and spring maize (8.4% and 12.7%) compared with the ST and CT treatments, respectively. Different tillage significantly influenced the yield stability and sustainability of winter wheat, but no marked differences were observed in spring maize. In addition, a nonlinear relationship indicated that maximal SOC storage-responsive C input levels ranged from 3580 kg.ha(-1) to 6007 kg.ha(-1) for winter wheat and spring maize. ST/CT rotation can increase SOC storage before C saturation to reach maximized yield. To improve and sustain nutrient storage and crop production in winter wheat-fallow-spring maize rotation fields, ST/CT rotation seems to be a more suitable tillage practice.

However, studies on the effects of diurnal temperature fluctuations on organisms, especially the effects on specific life stages, are still limited. We examined the immediate effects of the same average temperature (25 degrees C) and different temperature amplitudes (+/- 4, +/- 6, +/- 8, +/- 10, +/- 12 degrees C) on the development and survival of Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae). We also assessed carry-over effects on adult longevity, reproduction, development, and survival of offspring across generations. The effect of moderate temperature amplitudes was similar to that of constant temperature. Wide temperature amplitudes inhibited the development of pupae, reduced total reproduction, lowered intrinsic rates of population growth, and slowed the development and survival of eggs on the first day, but the proportion of females ovipositing on the first three days increased. Insects coped with the adverse effects of wide temperature amplitudes by laying eggs as soon as possible. Our results confirmed that a logistic model based on daily average temperature cannot predict development rates under wide temperature amplitudes. These findings highlight the effect of environmental temperature fluctuations at the pupal stage on the development and oviposition patterns of P. xylostella and should be fully considered when predicting field occurrence.					xing, k/JEP-6928-2023	Zhao, Fei/0000-0003-4158-3604													0046-225X	1938-2936				AUG	2021	50	4					888	897		10.1093/ee/nvab044	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvab044		MAY 2021						33974683					WOS:000709908300014

We studied the direct and indirect effects of plant diversity on soil organic carbon storage and soil infiltration capacity in semiarid grasslands. Plant species diversity enhances soil organic carbon and soil infiltration capacity via multiple plant-soil feedback mechanisms in long-term natural restoration grasslands. Plant species diversity increases community productivity, resulting in increasing soil carbon storage, which improves soil infiltration capacity by influencing soil aggregate stability and porosity. The present study indicates that plant species diversity is conducive to increasing atmospheric CO2 sequestration and reducing the risk of soil erosion. Our study provides a framework for interpreting the relationships among plant species diversity, soil organic carbon, and soil infiltration capacity to understand plant-soil feedback mechanisms in semiarid grasslands.

The rhizosphere is a focus of soil microbial communities, but the patterns and drivers of these communities have rarely been studied in alpine ecosystems. We used high-throughput Illumina sequencing to examine the community variations of bacteria, archaea and fungi between the rhizosphere and bulk soil along an altitudinal gradient in an Abies fabri (Mast.) community on Mount Gongga of the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Microbial alpha diversity and community structure varied significantly with altitude but not between the rhizosphere and bulk soil. Soil temperature and the carbon:nitrogen ratio were the primary drivers of the structures of the bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities, and altitude (geographic distance) contributed a small part (< 3%) of the community variation, indicating that various edaphic factors were the key regulators of microbial community variation. This consistency of the microbial communities between the rhizosphere and bulk soil in this alpine ecosystem could be attributed to low temperature and high nutrient content. The bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities were governed by specific environmental factors (total phosphorus content for bacteria; organic-carbon content, dissolved organic-carbon content, NH4+-N content and nutrient stoichiometry for archaea and NO3--N content for fungi). The distinct environmental responses of the microbial taxa suggested metabolic separation and resource preferences of the belowground communities, even within the small-scale spatial distances in this alpine ecosystem. Our study suggested that the ecosystem harbored many microbial taxa with diverse nutrient preferences and metabolic characteristics and could thus potentially tolerate the soil environmental variation under a scenario of climate change.

However, the patterns and mechanisms of post-disturbance ecosystem succession have rarely been studied. Here we reported that disturbance level determined the importance of stochastic relative to deterministic changes in ecosystem components (plant community composition, soil microbial community composition, and soil physicochemical indices), and thus predefined the pattern of post-disturbance ecosystem succession. We proposed a theoretical framework with five disturbance levels corresponding to distinct succession patterns. We conducted a nitrogen addition experiment in a temperate steppe, monitored these ecosystem components during "disturbance" treatment (2010-2014) and post-treatment "succession" (2014-2018). The disturbance level experienced by each component in each treatment was inferred by fitting the observed succession patterns into the theoretical framework. The mean disturbance level of these components was found to increase quadratically with nitrogen addition rate. This was because increasing nitrogen addition reduced the importance of stochastic relative to deterministic changes in these components, and these changes had a quadratic relationship with disturbance level. Overall, our results suggested that by monitoring the importance of stochastic relative to deterministic changes in an ecosystem, we can estimate disturbance levels and predict succession patterns, as well as propose disturbance-level-dependent strategies for post-disturbance restoration.

AGRONOMY-BASEL												Sunflower broomrape (Orobanche cumana Wallr.) is a weedy root parasite that causes huge damage to sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). Trap crop can stimulate parasitic seed germination without attachment in trap crop, and it was considered as economic methods for controlling the parasite. In this study, co-culture and pot experiments were conducted to assess the allelopathic activity of maize (Zea mays L.) to stimulate broomrape seeds germination and to evaluate the performance of maize rotation for reducing sunflower broomrape infection. All the tested maize cultivars could induce sunflower broomrape germination, and the most active maize cultivar was N314, which induced approximately 40% broomrape seeds germination. Rotation of maize significantly reduced broomrape infection on subsequent sunflower and increased sunflower biomass. After cultivated N314 for 3 years, broomrape attachment on sunflower was the lowest (0.8 attachment plant(-1)), and the dry mass of sunflower shoot (28.7 g plant(-1)) was approximately twice higher than the sunflower without previous crop. The effectiveness of broomrape management was significantly different among various maize cultivars. Meanwhile, the differences among cultivars were decreased with the years of maize cultivated prolonged. Our results confirmed that maize was significantly effective in reducing the sunflower damage caused by sunflower broomrape and suggested that maize rotation could be included in the integrated management of sunflower broomrape.

However, the water uptake strategy of apple trees and its link with precipitation and soil water dynamics (i.e., contents, recharge proportion and residence time) remains poorly understood. In this study, we determined the source water of apple trees, the recharge proportion and mean residence time (MRT) of soil water through collecting precipitation, soil water and xylem water samples with a high frequency. Results indicated that apple trees mainly absorbed water from shallow soil layers of 0-2 m (>64%) in the early growing season (May to July), but deep soil water below 2 m (similar to 60%) in the late growing season (August to October). As such, apple trees had seasonal variations in water uptake strategies by shifting water sources from shallow to deep soils. In addition, the proportions of water uptake from the same soil layer varied with tree ages. The proportions of water uptake from different soil layers were not significantly correlated to the corresponding soil water contents (p > 0.05), which may be attributed to the long residence time of soil water (14-99 days). Therefore, the water uptake strategies of apple trees were likely to be influenced by precipitation and MRT of soil water, as well as stand ages. The indicated relationship between water uptake strategies and precipitation and soil water dynamics can improve insights into the interaction between soil and vegetation.

This study aimed to determine the characteristics and potential mechanisms of microbial metabolic limitation at the different growth stages of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in response to elevated CO2 concentrations, warming and drought. Winter wheat plants were grown in artificial climate chambers, and a set of treatments were employed, including two levels of CO2 concentration (400 and 800 mu mol.mol(-1)), a temperature regime (the current ambient temperature and a temperature increase of 4 degrees C) and water conditions (80% and 60% of the field water capacity). The results showed that the soil microbes were mainly limited by C and P. Microbial C limitation significantly decreased by 26.7% and 36.9% at the jointing stage and significantly increased by 47.6% and 42.6% at the grain filling stage in response to elevated CO2 and warming, respectively. The microbial P limitation significantly decreased by 10.9-13.0% under elevated CO2 at the anthesis and grain filling stages, while it was not affected by warming. Both microbial C and P limitations were unaffected by drought. The growth stage, soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and available phosphorus (AP) were the key factors affecting microbial C limitation, and microbial P limitation was mainly affected by the soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC), phosphorus (MBP) and microbial C:P ratio. Thus, the soil microbial C and P limitations differed with growth stages and were primarily indirectly affected by the available nutrients in the soil and the properties of the microbial biomass, respectively. These findings are important for understanding the mechanisms underlying microbe-mediated C and nutrient cycles. Overall, this study provides guidance for soil nutrient management in an agroecosystem experiencing climate change.																				2071-1050				JUN 2	2023	15	11							9037	10.3390/su15119037	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15119037													WOS:001004452600001

Plant root system has gradually played a key role in reducing soil detachment, with the implementation of a series of ecological restoration projects. However, few studies were conducted to evaluate soil detachment process under the combined effect of freeze-thaw and root system. This study investigated the potential effects of freeze-thaw and the root system on soil detachment capacity. Soil detachment capacity of two soil types, sandy loam and silt loam, was investigated, under four treatments, control (bare soil without freeze-thaw and root), freeze-thaw, root system and freeze-thaw + root system. A prediction model was developed to calculate soil detachment capacity under the effect of freeze-thaw and the root system. Hydraulic flume experiments were carried out at 4 flow rate (6-24L center dot min(-1)) and 1 slope (10 degrees). The results illustrated that the detachment capacity of sandy loam was higher than that of silt loam. The soil detachment capacity of two soils was reduced and increased by the root system and freeze-thaw, respectively, although the former effect was significant (P < 0.05) whereas the latter was not. The effect of freeze-thaw in combination with the root system showed that the root system contributed the majority of soil detachment capacity variability; therefore, the root system played a leading role in the inhibition of soil detachment capacity. When comparing shear stress, unit energy of the water carrying section and unit stream power, stream power was found to be the hydraulic parameter that best predicted soil detachment capacity (R-2 > 0.84). The inclusion of root weight density significantly improve the accuracy of the soil detachment capacity prediction model developed by hydraulic parameters. A general model based on stream power and root weight density was developed to quantify soil detachment capacity and was shown to have a high soil detachment capacity prediction accuracy for both soils treated by freeze-thaw and the root system [NSE = 0.88, R-2 = 0.90].

However, the effect of long-term vegetation restoration on soil hydrological properties and the corresponding influencing mechanisms remains poorly understood. Here, three soil hydrological properties including saturated water-holding capacity (SWHC), field capacity (FC) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), as well as several basic soil properties in the Zhifanggou watershed of the Loess plateau were investigated. The variations in SWHC, FC and Ks under different vegetation restoration types and their dominant influencing factors were analyzed. Moreover, we collected available Ks data from peer-reviewed publications to determine the land use with the largest Ks across the entire Loess Plateau. The results showed that SWHC FC and Ks were increased after 20 years of vegetation restoration. The higher Ks was found in shrubland and forest in the whole Loess Plateau. Compared with cropland, Ks in shrubland was increased by 87.10% at 0-20 cm, 48.89% at 20-40 cm, and 18.37% at 40-100 cm, respectively, indicating that the impact of revegetation on Ks were most obvious in the upper soil layer. Bulk density (BD), total porosity (TP), capillary porosity (CP), noncapillary porosity (NCP) and soil organic matter (SOM) had a significant effect on SWHC, FC and Ks for different land-use types (P < 0.01). Soil porosity (i.e., TP, CP and NCP) and BD, soil chemical properties (i.e., SOM and pH), and soil particle composition explained 93.8%, 59.2%, and 13.4% of the total variance in soil hydrological properties (i.e., SWHC, FC and Ks), respectively. This indicates that soil porosity and BD are the dominant factors affecting soil hydrological properties. Moreover, soil particle composition played an important role in regulating Ks, with the contribution of 38.6%. The established pedotransfer function (PTF) of Ks using BD, clay and silt content had a better performance than two existing PTFs. This research provides a more systematic and comprehensive understanding of the soil hydrological effect of vegetation restoration in the Loess Plateau.

We quantified variation in dispersal traits in a wind-dispersed annual, Geropogon hybridus (Asteraceae), focusing on continuous morphological traits of dispersive diaspores and their relationships to dispersal ability and seedling emergence. Methods We measured the morphological traits, terminal velocity, and seedling emergence of 1140 seeds from 10 populations in two successive years. We assessed the variation in traits among three hierarchical levels of organization and between years, and quantified their effects on diaspore terminal velocity and seedling emergence. Results Diaspore morphological traits varied substantially at the population, plant, and diaspore levels. Variables of pappus geometry, especially pappus width and pappus opening angle, were consistent between years and were found to be the best predictors of diaspore terminal velocity and seedling emergence. There was a significant negative relationship between diaspore terminal velocity and seedling emergence. Conclusions The intraspecific variation in diaspore traits is sufficiently large to substantially allow a dispersal-dormancy trade-off of individual diaspores. Our results support the hypothesis that traits of dispersive diaspores evolve in concert to select for increased dispersal potential, and provide an avenue to predict plant offspring performance through simply measured traits.

However, some of the water saved was lost through evaporation from bare soil and transpiration by weeds. So far, no measurement has been done in the region to address this non-productive water loss, thereby limiting the water-saving potential of the introduced LFS. Furthermore, the reduction in crop production under the summer-maize - fallow system threatens food security. The objective of this study was to determine which practice is effective to keep soil water during fallow and the exact water-saving potential of different cropping system in the region. Firstly, field experiments were conducted under various soil surface management systems - including plastic mulching (PM), straw mulching (SM), shallow tillage (ST) and weed control (WC). The effects of saving water, controlling weeds and managing nutrients were analyzed under the various surface soil management methods. The results showed that compared with the control (no soil surface management, CK), 177, 64.7, 71.0 and 25.0 mm of water was saved respectively under PM, SM, WC and ST surface soil management methods in 2019-2020. The effect of weed control decreased in the order of PM > WC > SM > ST. While PM significantly increased soil nutrient in all the treatments, the others showed slight but insignificant increases. Secondly, the precise water-use of each of the cropping systems was determined using large lysimeters. The analysis showed that compared with the wheat-maize system, 60-100 mm of water was saved under alternating wheat-soybean, wheat-millet, mung bean - fresh edible maize, spring sweet potato cropping systems. The results were key for technical guide in developing future cultivation adjustment policies.						han, shu min/0000-0001-5390-0182													0378-3774	1873-2283				NOV 1	2023	289								108543	10.1016/j.agwat.2023.108543	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2023.108543		OCT 2023											WOS:001091827100001

This study aimed to analyze the characteristics of the components of the water consumption of winter wheat on the Loess Plateau in China to investigate their effects on yield and water use efficiency (WUE). Winter wheat observation data were collected from 1981 to 2020 at the Xifeng Agrometeorological Station on the Loess Plateau. The results show that over the past 40 years, the average water consumption of the winter wheat fields was 315 mm, but there were large differences between years. The soil water was first converted from precipitation (P) during the growing season, accounting for 69.4%, and then consumed via soil water storage (?W) in the fallow period, accounting for 30.6%. The yield of winter wheat varied from 1057 to 6914 kg.ha(-1). The correlation between winter wheat yield and P during the growth period was stronger than the correlation between winter wheat yield and ?W. The average WUE was 11.0 kg.ha(-1).mm(-1) from 1981 to 2020, with the highest value of 13.7 kg.ha(-1).mm(-1) occurring in the 2010s and the lowest value of 9.6 kg.ha(-1).mm(-1) occurring in the 2000s. The WUE was positively correlated with P (p < 0.01) during the growth period and negatively correlated with ?W (p < 0.05). Therefore, P can increase yield and WUE more effectively than ?W. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the efficient utilization of water resources on the Loess Plateau and the sustainable development of dry farming.

A.; Vervoort, Willem			Space-time modelling of groundwater level and salinity	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Soil salinization resulting from shallow saline groundwater is a major global environmental issue causing land degradation, especially in semi-arid regions such as Australia. The adverse impact of shallow saline groundwater on soil salinization varies in space and time due to the variation in groundwater levels and salt concentration. Understanding the spatio-temporal variation is therefore vital to develop an effective salinity management strategy. In New South Wales, Australia, a hydrogeological landscape unit approach is generally applied, based on spatial information and expert operators, classifying the landscape in relation to landscape and climate. In this paper, a data science approach (random forest model) is introduced, based on historical groundwater quality and quantity data providing predictions in a 4-dimensional space. As a case study, we demonstrate the spatio-temporal factors impacting standing water levels (SWL) and associated salinity and predict the spatial and temporal variability in the Muttama catchment (1059 km(2)), in NSW, south eastern Australia. The random forest model explains 77% of the variance in the groundwater salinity (electrical conductivity) and 65% of the SWL. Spatial factors were the most significant variables determining the space-time variation in groundwater salinity and the occurrence of groundwater at the surface. Drilled piezometer depth and elevation are dominant factors controlling SWL, while salinity is mainly determined by underlying geology. The methodology in this study predicts salinity and SWL in the landscape at fine scales, through time, improving options for salinity management. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Testing differences with four analyses of infracommunity modelling for seven parasite-host associations	PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH												One of the challenges in studies of parasite community ecology is whether the input data for analyses should be parasite abundances/counts, i.e. count data (CD), or parasite incidences (presences/absences), i.e. incidence data (ID). We analysed species responses to environmental factors and species associations in the infracommunities of helminths and ectoparasites in four hosts from Europe (Sorex araneus and Myodes glareolus) and South Africa (Rhabdomys pumilio and Rhabdomys dilectus) and compared the results of four analyses [redundancy analysis (RD), RLQ analysis, joint species distribution modelling (JSDM) and Markov random fields (MRF)] that used either CD or ID as an input. In addition, we compared the differences between the CD and ID results of two analyses (JSDM and MRF) across parasite species between (a) host species within helminths and ectoparasites; (b) helminths and ectoparasites within a host species; and (c) parasite species with contrasting levels of intensity. The results of most analyses for the majority of parasite-host associations were qualitatively similar. However, models based on the ID input performed better than models based on the CD input in three out of four types of analyses (RDA, JSDM and MRF). The differences between the CD and ID models varied between host species (being the lowest in R. pumilio for JSDM and in S. araneus for MRF). However, they were not affected by the level of parasite intensity.

J	Fusco, G				Fusco, Giulio			Climate Change and Food Security in the Northern and Eastern African Regions: A Panel Data Analysis	SUSTAINABILITY												The problem of food insecurity is growing across the world, in particular in developing countries. Due to their economic structure, climate change represents one of the major threats for food security levels in African countries. The object of this work was to assess the impact of climate change on the level of food security in the North and East African countries, using a panel data analysis for the period 2000-2012. Average protein supply and average dietary energy supply adequacy were the two different indicators of food security we identified as most appropriate. Indeed, both indicators can provide information concerning the amount and the nutritional value of food supply. The determinants of food security are expressed as a function of rainfall, temperature, land area under cereal production, size of population and GDP. Findings showed that food security in the Northern and Eastern African countries is adversely affected by climate change. Policy makers need to promote those actions capable of mitigating global warming and reducing its economic impact.																				2071-1050				OCT	2022	14	19							12664	10.3390/su141912664	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su141912664													WOS:000867358500001

EFFECT OF DIFFERENT SOWING METHODS AND NITROGEN RATES ON YIELD AND QUALITY OF WINTER WHEAT IN LOESS PLATEAU OF CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												In order to explore the optimum amount of nitrogen application in different sowing methods of winter wheat, a field experiment was conducted at Wenxi experimental site of Shanxi Agriculture University (2017-2018), The two sowing methods were (I) Wide Space Sowing (WSS), and (II) Drilling Sowing (DS) with seven nitrogen treatments: 0 kg.hm 90 kg.hm(-2), 180 kg.hm(-2), 210 kg hm(-2), 240 kg hm(-2), 270 kg hm(-2) and 300 kg hm(-2). (WSS) significantly increased the number of spikes yield and number of kernels per spike, nitrogen rate which ultimately increased the yield. The yield was the highest at 240 kg.hm(-2) and 210 kg.hm(-2), respectively. Nitrogen application significantly increased the Net Photosynthesis Rate (Pn), intercellular carbon dioxide concentration (Ci) and transpiration rate (Tr) and decreased the stomatal conductance (Gs) of post-anthesis flag leaves. Wide space sowing wheat with N240 was the best. Compared with other nitrogen application rates, (WSS) with the nitrogen of 240 kg. hm(-2) increased nitrogen accumulation in all growth stage while nitrogen uptake efficiency, nitrogen use efficiency and nitrogen productive efficiency were the highest at 90 kg.hm(-2) and lowest at 300 kg.hm(-2). The accumulation of soluble sugar in the middle and late stages increased and the sucrose content and starch content increased in each period after anthesis. The content of each protein component increased the albumin which was the highest at 240 kg.hm(-2) and the globulin was the highest at 270 kg.hm(-2). The prolamin and glutenin (storage protein) were the highest at 300 kg.hm(-2) and in 240 kg.hm(-2). The protein content at 300 kg.hm(-2), and protein yield at 240 kg.hm(-2) were significantly improved compared to other nitrogen application rates. The sedimentation value, falling value, formation time, development time, wet gluten and the gluten index increased and the water absorption rate was relatively stable as nitrogen fertilizer increased.

Using Pulsed Electric Fields (PEF) Technology and Thermal Processing	PROCESSES												The objective of this study was to assess the impact of pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment on the extraction of polyphenolics and antioxidant activity from downgraded date palm fruits. The PEF pretreatments (frequency: 30 Hz, time: 50 mu s, pulse number: 240, the electric field strengths were found to be 1, 2, and 2.5 kV.cm(-1), and methanol (50%) and temperatures (20, 40, 50 degrees C)) were optimized and applied before extraction to produce an extract of date fruits with a high content of bioactive compounds. The extracts obtained immediately after pretreatments were analyzed for total polyphenolic content, antioxidant activity, and phenolic profiles. The results revealed that the PEF-assisted extracts at 2.5 kV.cm(-1) at T-50 degrees C exhibited higher polyphenol content (+27%) and antioxidant activity (+31%) and notably improved phenolic profiles compared to untreated extracts. PEF treatment processing significantly enhanced the bioactive components and antioxidant activities of date fruits over time, regardless of the treatment applied and the extraction's temperature. Hence, the application of PEF combined with thermal processing can be an appropriate alternative treatment for a better extractability of bioactive compounds from fruit of dates and food byproducts. These biomolecules could be consumed as new food technology, incorporated as food additives, and nutraceuticals products.

Ecological stoichiometry (C:N:P ratios) in soil is an important indicator of the elemental balance in ecological interactions and processes. Long-term natural vegetation plays an important role in the accumulation and distribution of soil stoichiometry. However, information about the effects of long-term secondary forest succession on soil stoichiometry along a deep soil profile is still limited. Methods. We selected Ziwuling secondary succession forest developed from farmland as the study area, investigated the concentrations and stoichiometry of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) at a depth of 0-100 cm along a 90-year succession chronosequence, including farmland (control), grassland, shrub, early forest, and climax forest. Results. SOC and TN concentrations significantly increased with increasing restoration age, whereas soil P concentration remained relatively stable across various successional stages. SOC and TN concentrations decreased with an increase in soil depth, exhibiting distinct soil nutrient "surface-aggregation" (high nutrients concentration in the top soil layer). The soil C:P and N:P ratios increased with an increase in restoration age, whereas the variation of the C:N ratio was small and relatively stable across vegetation succession. The nutrient limitation changed along with vegetation succession, transitioning from limited N in the earlier successional stages to limited P in the later successional stages. Conclusion. Our results suggest that more nitrogen input should be applied to earlier succession stages, and more phosphorus input should be utilized in later succession stages in order to address limited availability of these elements. In general, natural vegetation restoration was an ecologically beneficial practice for the recovery of degraded soils in this area. The findings of this study strengthen our understanding of the changes of soil nutrient concentration and nutrient limitation after vegetation restoration, and provide a simple guideline for future vegetation restoration and reconstruction efforts on the Loess Plateau.

Climate vulnerability assessment in semi-arid and arid region of Rajasthan, India: An enquiry into the disadvantaged districts	JOURNAL OF AGROMETEOROLOGY												This paper assesses the district level climate vulnerability in the state of Rajasthan using large-scale data on climate and socio-economic variables. More than thirty indicators segregated into four components of exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity and crop production loss were combined to develop a composite index of vulnerability and homogenous districts were clustered into three categories, viz. low, medium and high. Wide inter-district variations were observed across the calculated indices. The result reveals that highest production losses occurred in Ganganagar district followed by Hanumangarh and Bharatpur. Pali was least exposed to the climatic variability, whereas Bundi had the maximum exposure. Jaisalmer rated the maximum sensitivity level. Further, Pratapgarh followed by Jaisalmer and Banswara had the lowest degree of adaptive capacity. On the whole, districts like Hanumangarh, Jaisalmer, Ganganagar, Bundi, Bharatpur, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Chittorgarh, Alwar, Baran and Pratapgarh exhibit high level of vulnerability to climatic change. While on the other spectrum Sirohi district was least vulnerable due to lower exposure, sensitivity, crop production loss and high adaptive capacity. The analysis, suggests the need for prioritizing vulnerable areas to arrest regional imbalances by encouraging need/location based interventions for moderating the degree of vulnerability, whilst making agro-ecosystem in Rajasthan resilient to climatic aberrations.

However, due to the limitations of existing research methods, data resources and spatiotemporal differences, universal conclusions and benchmark references at large spatial scales under the background of climate warming have been lacking in recent decades. In a systematic review, we evaluated primary studies and comprehensively analyzed the pooled correlation (pooled r (Pr)) between precipitation and TDV (P-TDV) in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) over the past 40 years by using a meta-analysis method to explore the monthly scale response pattern and heterogeneity pattern and to reveal the key TDV growth period under drought stress at a large spatial scale. The results showed the following. (1) In the mean state, the correlation between precipitation and TDV was at a moderate level in the NH over the last 40 years (Pr = 0.31). The spring Pr value was lowest, and the results were nonsignificant (p > 0.05). The highest Pr value was 0.40, and this value appeared in summer, followed by a value of 0.22 in autumn; the strongest relationship was found in June (Pr = 0.56). (2) The Pr values of TDV and precipitation with 1-and 2-month lag times were 0.34 and 0.31, respectively; these values were higher than those derived using lag times longer than 2 months. The statistical results were all significant and reflected a moderate correlation level. The above conclusions showed that TDV growth has the strongest demand for water in June and that spring drought conditions may have been one of the main stress factors affecting the growth of desert vegetation at the intra-annual scale in the northern temperate zone over the past 40 years.

We conducted a field monitoring experiment in the Liudaogou Catchment on the Loess Plateau in China to determine the spatiotemporal response of shallow groundwater recharge and base flow by precipitation in check dams of this loessial hilly and gully region. The amount and seasonal distribution of precipitation directly affected the changes in shallow groundwater and base flow. The shallow groundwater was recharged by in situ vertical infiltration and lateral underground movement. Precipitation >30.0 mm d(-1) recharged the shallow groundwater by piston flow when the water table in the check dam was <4.0 m. When the water table varied from the head (>4.0 m) to the middle and tail (<4.0 m) of the check dam, the influx of precipitation was by runoff in the catchment above the trench head, replenishing the groundwater vertically through the trench head and then moving laterally underground to the end of the dam. The response of the base flow and groundwater lagged the precipitation by a certain period. The lag time of the base flow was about 5-16 days, inwhich the response was more sensitive than for shallow groundwater. The lag time of the vertical supply for the response of the precipitation to the shallow groundwater was about 12-54 days, whereas the lag time for the lateral supply was about 72-93 days. The lag time may be associated with precipitation, temperature, solar radiation, vegetation water consumption and soil porosity. These findings will help elucidate the processes of groundwater recharge and provide new insight for managing the water balance in this loessial hilly and gully region. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

High-resolution R-s measurements are limited owing to the high costs of measuring devices, and their stringent operational maintenance procedures. This study evaluated a newly developed machine learning model, namely the hybrid particle swarm optimization and extreme learning machine (PSO-ELM), to accurately predict daily R-s. The newly proposed model was compared with five other machine learning models, namely the original ELM, support vector machine, generalized regression neural networks, M5 model tree, and autoencoder, under two training scenarios using long-term R-s and other climatic data taken during 1961-2016 from seven stations located on the Loess Plateau of China. Overall, the PSO-ELM with full climatic data as inputs provided more accurate R-s estimations. We also calculated the daily R-s at fifty other stations without R-s measurements on the Loess Plateau using the PSO-ELM model, as well as the potential photovoltaic (PV) power using an empirical PV power model, and then generated high-resolution (0.25 degrees) R-s and PV power data to investigate the patterns of R-s and PV power. Significant reductions in R-s (- 6.49 MJ m(-2) per year, p < 0.05) and PV power (- 0.46 kWh m(-2) per year, p < 0.05) were observed. The northwestern parts of the study area exhibited more R-s and PV power and are therefore considered more favorable for solar energy-related applications. Our study confirms the effectiveness of the PSO-ELM for solar energy modeling, particularly in areas where in-situ measurements are unavailable.

This study analyzed the daily runoff time series at six gauging stations during 1960-2016 in Wuding River basin, northwestern China. The Mann-Kendall test and Lee-Heghinian method were employed to detect the temporal trends and abrupt changes in annual streamflow. The flow duration curve (FDC) and the index of hydrologic alteration (IFIA)/Range of Variability Approach (RVA) were applied to assess the daily streamflow and degree of hydrologic alteration (DHA). In addition, we analyzed the changes of index of hydrological connectivity (IC) and reservoirs/dams (RI) in 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2015 in the basin. The relationship between IC, RI and DHA were assessed to investigate the potential influences of land use changes and constructions of reservoirs/darns on hydrological alteration. The results indicated that annual streamflow at five stations showed significant downward trends (p < 0.01) from 1960 to 2016, and an abrupt changing point appeared in the beginning of 1970s in Wuding River basin. Exception is Qingyangcha station without significant changes, and Hanjiamao station with changing point in 1967. FDC analysis indicated that both high and low flow indices reduced greatly. The integral DHA were higher than 70% at all the stations in the Wuding River basin, suggesting great variation in the magnitude, duration, frequency, timing and rate of change of daily streamflow. Both IC value and RI had dose relationship with DHA, implying that DHA was highly affected by land use changes and dams/reservoirs constructions, and was more sensitive to the land use change (p < 0.01). This study provides good insight to understand the effects of soil and water conservation measures on hydrological regime. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Meanwhile, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and nitric oxide (NO) as signaling molecules are known to promote plant growth in metal-contaminated soils. However, the regulatory mechanisms of such molecules in plant physiology and soil biochemistry have not been well-documented. Hence, we investigate the role of the exogenous application of H2S and NO on alfalfa growth in lead/cadmium (Pb/Cd)-contaminated soil. Our results indicate that the signaling molecules increase the alfalfa chlorophyll and biomass content and improve alfalfa growth. Further, H2S and NO reduce the translocation and bioconcentration factors of Pb and Cd, potentially reducing the risk of heavy metals entering the food chain. These signaling molecules reduce metal-induced oxidative damage to alfalfa by mitigating reactive oxygen species accumulation and increasing antioxidant enzyme activities. Their exogenous application increases soil enzymatic activities, particularly of catalase and polyphenol oxidase, without significantly changing the composition and structure of rhizosphere bacterial communities. Interestingly, H2S addition enriches the abundance of plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria in soil, including Nocardioides, Rhizobium, and Glycomyces.

J	Wang, JW; Lv, XR; Zhang, KD; Li, P; Meng, H				Wang, Jingwen; Lv, Xiangru; Zhang, Kuandi; Li, Pu; Meng, He			Unsteady-State Hydraulic Characteristics of Overland Flow	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												Indoor experiments consisting of 15 flow discharges, six kinds of roughness, and five different gradients were systematically investigated to discover the evolution laws of rolling waves, flow regimes, and resistance characteristics. The results showed increasingly apparent production of rolling waves due to instability of overland flow on the slope surface when unit discharge increased. However, as discharge increased continuously, rolling waves disappeared. Meanwhile, the defined unit charge regions of rolling-wave flow decreased with increasing roughness. When slope gradient J<0.1564, the flow state index (m) of overland flow first increased and then decreased with increasing roughness. However, it decreased steadily when J>0.1564. Moreover, when ks <= 0.08 mm, m increased as the slope increased and decreased when ks >= 0.08 mm, with a mean value of 0.543. Thus, the overland flow on a slope is a mixed-flow zone dominated by transitional flow and supplemented by laminar flow. This is consistent with results obtained using the traditional discriminant method. However, the flow regimes existed in the laminar instability zone when a better discriminant method was adopted based on the viscosity-depth ratio. As for flow patterns, when the Froude number discriminant method was adopted, the water flow was supercritical flow. The resistance coefficient was inversely proportional to Reynolds number and was based on frictional resistance, thickness of the viscous sublayer, pressure drag, and roll waves resulting from the increasing-resistance phenomenon of roughness. Finally, a formula for calculating resistance is proposed based on the resistance characteristics [f=(24/Re)+(14,041/Red1.33?3.11), R2=0.66]. These results provide a theoretical basis for the prediction model of soil erosion on the slope and applies the theory of open-channel flow to overland flow.

This study aims at exploring different mulching materials on the soil water content, photosynthetic characteristics, wheat yield, and yield components of winter wheat in the gully region of the Loess Plateau. The results showed that the traditional flat soil water content is the lowest in the seedling stage. In the jointing stage and heading stage of many crop water requirements, ridge film mulching treatment can effectively promote the growth of wheat and increase the water use efficiency. The leaf area index (LAI) of different treatments wheat showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing. In the jointing stage, ordinary mulching film (T1) and liquid mulching film (T3) had the highest LAI content, which were 3.78 and 3.71 respectively. The Pn and Gs in wheat flag leaves of T3 treatment is higher than that of CK throughout the entire growth period, and T3 significantly increased Ci and WUEi in different growth stage. And the grain number per panicle and grain weight of T3 treatment were 24.44 and 41.00 g, which were 19.3% and 5.4% higher than CK, respectively. Through the actual production calculation of the final harvest, the ridge film mulching has a significant increase in production compared with the CK. The yield of T3 treatment was 4980.25 kg hm(-2), which was 29.37% higher than CK. It was significantly different from CK (P < 0.05). Based on the comprehensive analysis, the ridge film mulching treatment significantly affected the soil water content and wheat yield. And the liquid mulching film had the best effect. Exploring the impact of different covering techniques on the wheat cultivation system in the Loess Plateau region, to promote the scientific promotion of this technology.																			2045-2322					OCT 23	2023	13	1							18106	10.1038/s41598-023-45309-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-45309-7								37872281					WOS:001087271600064

Through the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and Soil Loss Tolerance (SLT) index supported with remote sensing, Geographic Information System (GIS) and expert knowledge, we investigated the net mean annual soil loss (NSL) and SLT for planning SWC along different agro-climatic zones, and geomorphic features in Seharti-Samre district, Tigray-northern Ethiopian Highlands. Satellite and ground observed data sets, such as Digital Elevation Model, Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI), soil, and climate were collected and processed using geo-spatial softwares. The findings revealed that the estimated mean NSL and SLT in the study area are 86.8 t ha(-1) y(-1) and 6.8 t ha(-1) y(-1), respectively. Besides, the study found that the NSL and SLT rates for lowland, midland and highland areas are 178.4 and 3.5 t ha(-1) y(-1); 72.8 and 7.4 t ha(-1) y(-1); and 44.1 and 7.5 t ha(-1) y(-1), respectively. The statistical relationship between NSL and SLT at pixel level in the study area is negative (r = - 0.038) at p < 0.001. The quantitative analysis and modeling of NSL and SLT have a paramount significance at district or watershed level to implement better SWC practices for reducing soil erosion and maximizing land productivity in a degraded semi-arid environment.

J	Zhang, Y; Zhang, DJ				Zhang, Yu; Zhang, Daojun			Efficiency Measurement and Influencing Factors of Ecological Compensation: A Case Study from Wuqi and Zhidan on the Loess Plateau	NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH												It is of great significance to measure and evaluate vegetation restoration efficiency of ecological compensation (VREoEC) in an ecological project. However, the output efficiency of ecological compensation is still unclear, and its influencing factors need further exploration. In this research, Wuqi and Zhidan, two pioneer counties in China's Grain for Green (GFG) project, were taken together as the study area, and remote sensing vegetation indices were used to reflect the vegetation coverage level, and the geographically-weighted regression model was applied to measure the VREoEC in the GFG project. Then, the classic multiple linear regression model was used to explore the influencing factors of VREoEC. The findings were as follows: (1) while the overall vegetation coverage in the study area was improved greatly, the VREoEC showed noticeable spatial trend and accumulation, and suffered from regional water-heat distribution; (2) local terrain, micro-climate conditions, rural roads density, classified highway, and intensity of ecological compensation affected the VREoEC; and (3) because local natural and socio-economic conditions can affect the VREoEC, ecological compensation measures need to be formulated according to local conditions. Thus, this study provides a methodological reference and corresponding policy suggestions.

Clay minerals, which are composed of layered silicates and are abundant in soil environment, provide an appropriate site for organic pollutants to form EPFRs. Our previous studies showed that combination of clay minerals and transition metal species such as Fe and Cu ions/oxides can effectively degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and significant EPFRs signal can be detected by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Aluminum (Al) is the most abundant metal element in the earth's crust, however, to the best of our knowledge, few studies have reported the formation of EPFRs by organic pollutants contaminated Al(III)-clay minerals, and an unambiguous of the relevant interface process and mechanism is still lacking. In this paper, benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a strong carcinogenic PAHs compound, was used to contaminate Al(III)montmorillonite, and Na(I)-montmorillonite served as the control group. The degradation rate of B[a]P was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Fourier transform Infrared spectrometer (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to analyze the changes of functional groups and elements in the course of degradation of B[a]P. Since water content is an important factor in soil, three different relative humidity (RH) conditions (RH < 7%, similar to 33%, >97%) were selected to explore the stability of B[a]P-EPFRs. In order to confirm that the formation of EPFRs was accompanied by generation of hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) and superoxide radical (O-2(center dot-)), reactive oxygen species (ROS) capture experiment and radical quenching experiment were carried out. The results confirmed that Al(III)-montmorillonite was capable of accelerating the degradation of B[a]P, and the reaction rate was 37 times higher than that of Na(I)-montmorillonite. FTIR characterizations showed that the decay of old functional groups (C=C) was accompanied by forming new functional groups (C=O). XPS analysis revealed that upon sorption the. C=O band and C=O band occurred by analyzing the C 1s and O 1s, indicating the formation of oxygen-containing compounds. The RH experiment demonstrated that the conversion of B[a]P and the formation of EPFRs were not affected under relatively dry conditions (RH < 33%), and under the relative humidity greater than 97%, these processes were inhibited, indicating that considerable amount of water has an influence on the generation and attenuation of EPFRs in clay minerals. DMPO-OH and DMPO-OOH were captured by EPR in the ROS capture experiments. It was suggested that benzoic acid and 1,4- benzoquinone can quench center dot OH and O-2(center dot-) radical respectively, and the degradation rate of B[a]P was decreased significantly to 19.1% and 23.4% at 9 d respectively. In addition, the EPR intensity of EPFRs was obvious decreased, and this indicated that the formation of EPFRs was accompanied by the generation of ROS. The degradation of B[a]P and the formation of EPFRs were mainly attributed to electron transfer on the surface of Al(III)-montmorillonite. The formed center dot OH and O-2(center dot-) radical in the system can oxidize B[a]P radicals and eventually generate oxygen-containing compounds.

J	Abrham, T; Mekuyie, M				Abrham, Tigist; Mekuyie, Muluken			Effects of climate change on pastoral households in the Harshin District of the Somali Region, Ethiopia	JAMBA-JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK STUDIES												This study was conducted in the Harshin District of the Somali Region, Ethiopia, to understand the climate change trends, their consistency with pastoralists' perceptions and their effects on pastoral households. The study used both qualitative and quantitative data collected from 143 households through household surveys. Focus group discussions and key informant interviews were also employed to triangulate and substantiate the reports from household surveys. Data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and chi-square tests to test a degree of significance between the pastoral and agropastoral households for the impact of climate change. Mann-Kendall's trend test and Sen's slope estimator were employed to determine climate change trends of the study area. The result showed that pastoral households perceived an increasing trend in annual temperature and a decreasing trend in annual and seasonal rainfall. Mann-Kendall's trend analysis confirmed pastoral communities' perceptions of higher temperatures and rainfall variability, with the exception of a long-term decline in rainfall. The findings further indicated that six droughts (one severe and five moderate) were observed for the period 1983-2017. The result indicated that the significant increase in temperature along with high interannual and seasonal rainfall variability have been causing adverse impacts on crop and livestock production. Therefore, there is a need to provide drought-tolerant and early-maturing crops and improved livestock breeds for pastoral households. Water-related interventions such as small-scale irrigation farming and water harvesting during good rainy seasons is also paramount to enhance climate resilience of the local people.

In this context, tillering could be an alternative to increase reproductive and vegetative plasticity. The objectives of this study were to (a) characterize the correlation between environmental conditions, tiller traits, crop grain yield, and grain yield advantages due to tillers; (b) determine the grain yield response to tillering (i.e., grain yield difference between tillered and nontillered crops) for a wide range of environments; and (c) to evaluate the effect of tiller presence on grain yield of the main shoot, considering its effect on the apical and subapical ears. Tillered and nontillered crops were evaluated under rainfed conditions during two seasons (2018-2019 and 2019-2020). These experiments were carried out at 11 sites in the southern Argentinean Pampas, varying sowing date (22 Oct. to 5 Dec.), plant density (2-3 plants m(-2)), genotype (AX7784 and AX7761), and soil depth. Grain yield (3.2-11.9 Mg ha(-1)) was correlated with tillers productivity, mainly explained by postflowering precipitations. The contribution of tillers to grain yield was more proportional than their consequent yield depression at the main shoot. Tillers either increased (3 sites) or maintained (8 sites) grain yield, and their contribution increased as the environment improved without any detrimental effect in the most restrictive environments. Tillering has the potential for increasing resource (radiation, water, nitrogen) use efficiency under low plant density strategies adopted for restrictive environments.

However, the fate of various pools of organic P of added P in the long-term measured with sequential chemical fractionation is not well-understood. Four soil physical aggregates (>250, 125-250, 63-125 and <63 mu m) from 0- to 20-cm depth after 35 years of long-term fertilization treatments including control (CK), nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer (NP) and NP combined with farmyard manure (NPM) under continuous winter wheat were separated using settling tube apparatus. Results showed that the application of long-term P fertilization had no apparent effects on promoting the mass proportion of soil aggregates except for >250 mu m, where the NP and NPM treatments significantly increased the mass proportion by 60% and 70% over CK, respectively. Compared with CK, P fertilizer (NP and NPM) treatments significantly increased organic P (Po) contents in each size aggregate. In particular, mean labile Po increased by 35% and 246%, moderately labile Po by 125% and 161%, nonlabile Po by 105% and 170% and total Po (TPo) by 101% and 178%, respectively, under NP and NPM treatments, respectively. There was a significant correlation between soil organic carbon (SOC) and Po fractions. SOC was exponentially positively correlated with labile Po but linearly positively correlated with moderately labile Po, nonlabile Po and TPo fractions among soil aggregates. A reduced C:Po ratio (<100) in soil aggregates among treatment indicates a large amount of available P accumulated in soils, and soil P loss risk in the study site is still high. Our results show that the Po pool measured by sequential chemical fractionation may represent an important, yet often overlooked, source of P in agriculture ecosystems. According to the result, long-term mineral P fertilizer combined with organic amendments better sustains soil structural stability in large aggregates, contributing more Po availability in the moderately labile P followed by labile P in soil aggregates.					王, 娅冰/JGE-0541-2023														0266-0032	1475-2743				APR	2023	39	2					833	848		10.1111/sum.12901	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sum.12901		MAR 2023											WOS:000957854100001

To assess drought intensity, we introduced a normalized soil water index (NSWI) of land surface, on the basis of rainfall and actual evapotranspiration. Areas undergoing land surface drying on the Loess Plateau in 2001-2016 were assessed on the basis of the values of NSWI combined with rainfall and land surface water storage (LSWS). The extent of soil drying and wetting at depths of 0-0.01 m, 0-0.1 m and 0-2 m was also quantified. Results showed that up to 7.16% of the Loess Plateau was subjected to decreasing LSWS. On an inter-annual time scale, land surface drying intensified starting in 2003, and this pattern was chiefly evident at the soil depth of 2 m. The approach proposed in this study could also be used to identify temporary dry soil layers (DSLS) in arid ecosystems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Still, the effect of fire on below-ground biomass (BB) along a natural aridity gradient and the main impact factors remain unclear. Here, we conducted a fire manipulation experiment (including un-fired, autumn fire and spring fire treatments) to investigate the effects of prescribed fire on BB and its critical determinants along a transect of grassland in northern China. BB had different response strategies in different aridity regions and fire seasons, despite above-ground biomass (AB) and root-shoot ratio were not significantly affected by fire. General linear regression models revealed that the fire changed the trend of increasing BB to decreasing along increasing aridity (p < 0.05). Random forest model (RFM) and partial correlations revealed that the BB was primarily influenced by aridity, followed by the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentration ratio of AB under un-fired disturbance. For autumn fire, the BB was primarily influenced by below-ground biomass carbon con-centration (BB c), followed by the C and N concentration ratio of BB. For spring fire, the BB was primarily influenced by soil temperature (ST), followed by aridity and soil total phosphorus concentration (Soil p). Furthermore, partial least squares path model (PLS-PM) revealed that autumn fires weakened the effects of environmental factors on BB, while spring fires enhanced the effects of soil nutrients on BB. These suggested that fire disrupted the original stable nutrient dynamics of BB. Our results suggested that fire promoted the growth of BB in relatively humid areas (aridity = 0.51-0.53) while inhibited the growth of BB in relatively arid areas (aridity = 0.68-0.74). BB c and ST may be key drivers of BB after prescribed fire in autumn and spring.

M.; Hambloch, Caroline; McEwan, Margaret Anne			Putting diverse farming households' preferences and needs at the centre of seed system development	OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE												Over recent decades international agricultural research has shown that it can generate agricultural technologies with benefits for societies in the Global South that outstrip the investments many times over. However, it has also been shown that the benefits generated are not evenly spread and do not reach some groups of farmers at all. Too often, segments of the intended target populations are left out and these often tend to be those already 'left behind'. New seeds and varieties are important elements of agricultural technologies and the development of these relies on seed delivery systems to get new varieties to the farming population. Here we argue that a clear analysis of the preferences and needs of farming households and their inherent heterogeneity is required when setting the goals for breeding programmes and designing seed delivery systems. We characterize the differences in demand profiles, which implies different types of seed delivery models that are tailed to context, crop and preferences and the multiple needs of farming households. We point to the implications for organizing and targeting the seed delivery system in order to cater for all. Recognising the existence of diverse demands, developing different seeds and varieties and delivering them through a variety of models asks for clarity on mandates and opens up the opportunities for coordination that will lead to synergies in meeting the UN's Sustainable Development Goals and reach a wider population of farming households.

However, the spatial and temporal variations in soil erodibility (k) and the distribution of soil erosion across land use types and slopes remain unclear. We synthesized the results from 325 sites published in 152 literatures to analyze the factors affecting the k, such as land use type, climate, topography, soil, and vegetation restoration age. The results showed that areas with slopes >25 degrees had a larger k factor (k=0.1047) than did those with slope <6 degrees (k=0.0637) or 6-25 degrees (k=0.0832). The k from 2006 to 2011 (k=0.0725) was higher than that from 1999 to 2005 (k=0.058) and that from 2012 to 2016 (k=0.0631). The k value initially increased with vegetation restoration age and then gradually decreased. Land use also had an impact on the k factor, with the k factor of cropland (k=0.0697) being higher than that of grassland (k=0.0663) but lower than that of forest (k=0.0967). Across China, North Shaanxi, Heilongjiang, and South Guizhou, which are located in the Loess Plateau in Northwest China, the Black Soil region of Northeast China, and the Karst areas in Southwest China, respectively, were the three most severely eroded regions due to hydraulic erosion, frost-thaw erosion, and high-intensity erosion, respectively. Overall, the most important factors affecting the k were soil characteristics, followed by topography and climate. Among them, soil nitrogen and precipitation were the two most critical factors influencing the k.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014	ZHU, GUANGYU/0000-0002-8641-2422; zhouping, shangguan/0000-0002-5815-6310													2169-9003	2169-9011				MAR	2019	124	3					737	749		10.1029/2018JF004918	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JF004918													WOS:000463993300005
J	Liu, JX; Wang, B; Duan, XW				Liu, Jia-xin; Wang, Bing; Duan, Xing-wu			Temporal variation in soil detachment processes under litter incorporation effects in typical grassland on the Loess Plateau of China	CATENA												Plant litter incorporation into soil is a widespread phenomenon in the natural environment. Accurate estimation of the soil detachment capacity (Dc) driven by overland flow under litter incorporation effects is crucial for improving soil erosion prediction. However, the effects of litter incorporation on soil detachment processes are often ignored, and the temporal variation of Dc under litter incorporation effects remains unclear for grassland in the Loess Plateau of China. In this study, two litter incorporation soil treatments (Bothriochloa ischaemum (L.) Keng. litter, and Artemisia sacrorum Ledeb. litter) and one bare soil treatment (control) were set. Flume tests with flow shear stress ranging from 5.66 to 22.11 Pa were conducted to simulate overland flow scouring and determine the temporal variation of Dc between May 2017 and October 2018 (nine times, a 524-day period). Furthermore, the key factors affecting Dc were identified. Our results showed that the temporal variation in Dc was consistent across the different soil treatments (two litter incorporation treatments and one bare soil control), showing a rapid decline and then fluctuating at a low level, with Dc ranging from 0.115 to 6.876 kg m(-2) s(-1). Incorporation of litter effectively reduced Dc, with the Dc of soil treatments incorporating litter being 15% to 29% lower than that of bare soil (2.110 kg m(-2) s(-1)). Further analysis showed that the temporal variation in Dc was mainly affected by the development of a physical soil crust. Dc can be successfully estimated using a nonlinear equation incorporating flow shear stress and soil cohesion (R-2 = 0.77, NSE = 0.65), which represent the erosive force and soil erosion resistance, respectively. Our study reveals the important role of plant litter in the soil detachment process and aids the understanding of soil erosion pathways. Further studies are needed to investigate the effects of a physical soil crust on the soil detachment process driven by overland flow.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				AUG	2022	215								106358	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106358	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106358		MAY 2022											WOS:000805029700003
J	Li, YP; Wang, J; Shao, MA				Li, Yanpei; Wang, Jiao; Shao, Ming'an			Application of earthworm cast improves soil aggregation and aggregate-associated carbon stability in typical soils from Loess Plateau	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Earthworm casts exhibit remarkable fertility and have been widely used as an organic fertilizer. This study focused on the effects of earthworm cast application on soil aggregates and aggregate-associated carbon in typical soils from the Loess Plateau (China). Soil column experiments were conducted in the laboratory using cultivated loessial soil (CS), dark loessial soil (DS), and aeolian soil (AS). Application of earthworm casts significantly reduced the content of aggregates sized <0.5 mm but increased the content of water-stable aggregates. Compared to without-cast treatment, earthworm cast application increased the organic carbon content by 13.4-58.3%, 14.4-51.1%, 17.9-45.3%, 16.7-62.4%, 18.4-43.3%, and 19.8-62.9% in soil aggregate fractions of sizes 0.25, 0.25-0.5, 0.5-1, 1-2, 2-5, and 5 mm, respectively. The application of earthworm casts significantly increased heavy fraction organic carbon (HFOC), CaCO3, and exchangeable Ca contents in soil by 14.5-69.4%, 12.8-51.9%, and 33.3-63.2%, respectively. Compared with macroaggregates, microaggregates had higher CaCO3 contents but smaller light-fraction organic carbon (LFOC) to HFOC ratios, indicating that earthworm cast application improved the organic carbon stability more in microaggregates than macroaggregates. Comparison analysis of the three soils showed AS performed better in aggregation and aggregate-associated carbon stability than CS and DS after applying earthworm casts. The findings improve our understanding of the effects of earthworm cast application on soil aggregate distribution and aggregate-associated carbon stability, which will help improve the application efficiency of earthworm casts as an organic fertilizer in the Loess Plateau area.					lin, qing/JED-5250-2023; wu, yunhui/JGD-6838-2023														0301-4797	1095-8630				JAN 15	2021	278		1						111504	10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111504	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111504								33120095					WOS:000598177900009
J	Zhao, J; Mu, XM; Gao, P				Zhao, Juan; Mu, Xingmin; Gao, Peng			Dynamic response of runoff to soil and water conservation measures and precipitation based on VAR model	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												The Loess Plateau is one of the most erodible areas in the world, and numerous conservation measures have been implemented to control severe soil erosion. Better understanding of the changes in runoff and their influencing factors is required. A vector autoregression (VAR) model was used to simulate the dynamic relationship between runoff and six factors (precipitation, terraces, afforestation, grassing, check dams' construction, and grazing fencing) based on precipitation, runoff, and controlling measures of the Tuwei River basin in the middle reaches of the Yellow River during 1959-2012. Results showed that response of runoff usually lagged behind precipitation and the implementation of soil and water conservation measures. The annual runoff has no response to the increase of each measure area at the first year, but has varying degrees of response from the second year onward. Moreover, the same measure has different effects on runoff in different periods. The contribution of the factors that affect the annual runoff varied in the order of grazing fencing hillside < grassing < check dams' construction field < afforestation < precipitation < terraces. In the long term, the contribution of soil and water conservation measures would be greater than 70% in the fluctuation of annual runoff.																			1998-9563	2224-7955				JUN	2019	50	3					837	848		10.2166/nh.2019.074	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2019.074													WOS:000475454500003

This study was aimed to explore the release characteristics of MUS under different precipitation conditions and determine whether MUS facilitates the supply-demand synchrony of N for rainfed maize. The impact of U, SRN and MUS (U: SRN = 3:7) under two N application rate (180 and 240 kg N ha(-1)) on N absorption, NO3--N residue and net return of fertilizers were assessed during three consecutive years (starting in 2016). Results showed that N release from MUS was better synchronized with the N demand of rainfed maize relative to U and SRN, because N under MUS was released evenly during the maize growing seasons. Nitrogen uptake and the N remobilization efficiency in vegetative organs after silking under MUS were largely increased by 19-28% and 14-37% compared with the other treatments, respectively. In addition, the soil NO3--N residue under MUS decreased by 5-17% relative to other treatments. Physiological efficiency of N, grain yield and net return of MUS under 180 kg ha(-1) were significantly increased by 6-34%, 14-111% and 16-118% compared with the other treatments, respectively. In conclusion, the application of MUS under N rate of 180 kg ha(-1) enhanced N uptake and grain yield, and reduced fertilizer costs and soil N losses for rainfed maize in Northwest China.

However, microbial co-occurrence patterns and assembly processes under enhanced N levels is less known, especially with respect to the rhizosphere where microbes are closely linked with plant growth. Methods In this study, we performed a pot experiment using N addition gradient (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, and 15 g N center dot m(-2)center dot year(-1)) and amplicon sequencing and metabolomics to investigate the effect of short-term N addition (2 years) on the co-occurrence patterns and assembly process of bacterial communities as well as their potential drivers in the rhizosphere. Results Short-term N addition significantly altered bacterial community diversity and composition in the rhizosphere soil but not in the bulk soil; i.e., the rhizosphere bacterial diversity increased with N addition but decreased under high N input (>5 g N center dot m(-2)center dot year(-1)). The rhizosphere co-occurrence networks showed a more complex topology than the bulk soil, and this complexity could be strengthened by the quantity of N added. The N-induced establishment of the bacterial community in the rhizosphere was mainly dominated by deterministic processes with an increase in the variable selection in response to the increase in the N-addition rate, while the bacterial community in the bulk soil exhibited a transition from stochastic to deterministic processes. N addition stimulated the release of amino acids and short-chain organic acids into the rhizosphere, and these changes in root exudates and the soil NH4+-N level were mainly responsible for the changes in the structure of the rhizosphere bacterial community and co-occurrence networks of keystone species. Conclusions Our results demonstrated the differences in the co-occurrence patterns and assembly processes of bacterial communities between rhizosphere and bulk soils under N addition, which were closely associated with root exudates. These findings improve our understanding of plant-microbial interactions.

J	Zhou, LF; Yang, YX; Feng, H				Zhou, Lifeng; Yang, Yuxiang; Feng, Hao			Colored Plastic Film Mulching Regulates Light Quality and Sucrose Metabolism in Wine Grape in an Arid Desert Oasis	JOURNAL OF PLANT GROWTH REGULATION												Light quality regulates plant morphogenesis and physiological processes. Colored plastic film mulching (CPFM) may be used to improve light quality and crop quality. Here, we investigated how different CPFMs regulate light quality and affect sucrose metabolism in wine grapes. Plastic film mulching with four color schemes was used as treatments: red (PMr), blue (PMb), red alternating with blue (PMrb), and silver (CK). Spectral distribution of sunlight was significantly affected by different CPFMs. PMr and PMb increased the proportion of red and blue light respectively while PMrb increased both red and blue light below plant canopy. Photosynthetic rate (Pn) was the highest in PMrb in all treatments caused by the highest contents of leaf photosynthetic pigments (Chl a, Chl b, and Chl a + b). The activities of both sucrose synthase and invertase (acid invertase and neutral invertase) in leaves were significantly increased in PMrb, which led to higher total soluble solids (TSS) and same level of reducing sugars (RS) relative to the CK treatment. In addition, the highest Chl a/b in PMrb maybe the other reason for the highest TSS in all treatments. Grape yields did not differ among treatments, but treatments exhibited a decreasing trend for TSS, RS, and sugar acid ratio in wine grapes in the order of: PMrb, PMr, CK, and PMb. Relative to monochrome plastic mulching, PMrb can be an efficient method to enhance light quality below plant canopy, thereby improving fruit carbohydrate contents and components by regulating leaf photosynthetic pigments and sucrose metabolism enzyme activities.																			0721-7595	1435-8107				DEC	2023	42	12					7705	7714		10.1007/s00344-023-11043-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-023-11043-7		JUN 2023											WOS:001004046000001

However, less attention has been given to the complete succession ecosystem after farmland abandonment. To better understand the effect of moisture on leaf litter decomposition after farmland abandonment, in this study, we used three water gradients (10%, 25% and 50%) of field moisture capacity for succession vegetation. Furthermore, we used the typical species leaf litter decomposition of four succession stages-grassland (GL), shrubland (SL), pioneer forest (PF), and climax forest (CF) from the Loess Plateau of China. The results showed that leaves decomposition rate exhibited an increasing pattern with increasing moisture contents. The decomposition trend was shown as GL > SL > PF > CF. During the decomposition process, the leaf carbon concentration (LC) and leaf nitrogen concentration (LN) changed, but non-significantly. The effects of LC, LN, and LC: LN on leaf decomposition varied with vegetation type. Soil properties such as NH4+, NO3-, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and leaf quality parameters such as leaf cellulose, lignin, lignin: LN, and lignin: LC played an important role in driving leaf litter decomposition. Overall, the results provide evidence that litter decomposition in secondary forest succession system was linked to leaf and soil nutrient dynamics, and was limited by soil moisture.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014															1999-4907				SEP	2021	12	9							1195	10.3390/f12091195	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f12091195													WOS:000699773700001
J	Zhou, HX; Li, Z; Liu, WZ				Zhou, Haixiang; Li, Zhi; Liu, Wenzhao			Connotation analysis of parameters in the generalized nonlinear advection aridity model	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												The generalized nonlinear advection aridity model (GNAA) for evaporation (E) estimation can be expressed in a basic form with a single parameter alpha(e-0), or an extended form using two parameters, alpha(e-c) and c. The implications of these model parameters in the model and the accurate estimation of E are receiving increasing attention. Our study shows that alpha(e-0) and alpha(e-c) are affected by precipitation (P), the aridity index (E-pa/P) and the climate seasonality and asynchrony index (SAI), etc, with which alpha(e-0) has stronger correlations. This demonstrated that annual alpha(e-0) and alpha(e-c) could cover the alpha parameter in the Priestley-Taylor formula, as well as other factors, particularly the aridity index. For the basic GNAA form, annual alpha(e-0) is smaller than 1.00 in most catchments, but the GNAA model with the developed empirical formula between alpha(e-0) and E-pa/P can accurately estimate E at an annual scale. For the extended GNAA form, most annual alpha(e-c) were larger than 1.00, with a mean value of 1.08 for the Loess Plateau; alpha(e-c) tended to restore the original alpha values in the Priestley-Taylor equation. Functional differences exist between the basic and extended GNAA forms in estimating E and explaining the complementary relationship. Our results bridge some gaps in understanding the GNAA model from previous studies, and provide useful information to extend the application of the GNAA model.

Mid-infrared spectroscopy tracing of channel erosion in highly erosive catchments on the Chinese Loess Plateau	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Whether channel erosion or topsoil erosion constitutes the dominant erosion process throughout in the hilly region of the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP), which suffers perhaps the most severe soil erosion in the world, had been controversial for a long time. The present article attempts to use the mid -infrared (MIR) spectroscopy fingerprinting method to trace sediment sources within nine small catchments in the hilly region of the CLP. Two major categories of sediment sources are identified: channel sediment and topsoil. Sediments trapped by check dams are used as the final sediment transferred by soil erosion. Discriminant analysis shows that MIR spectroscopy can differentiate between the two kinds of source sediments very well. The contributions of channel sediment and topsoil to the total final sediment are quantified using partial least squares regression (PLSR) analyses of MIR spectra to compare the trapped sediment samples with experimental models. The results of the root mean square error of calibration, root mean square error of validation and coefficient of determination for 18 models all show that the MIR-PLSR models boast very high prediction abilities in the nine catchments. A comparison between the geochemical fingerprinting method and the MIR spectroscopy method in one catchment reveals that although the two methods agree well on the channel sediment contributions, the two methods produce a significant difference (R-2 = 0.4). Overall, the MIR -PLSR results show that channel sediments contribute 19% to 66% of the total sediment with an average of 33 +/- 16% in the nine small catchments. Our results indicate that although channel bank sediment is important, topsoil erosion is the predominant process in small dam controlled catchments on the CLP. Furthermore, the MIR spectroscopy fingerprinting method can provide a useful, non-destructive, rapid and inexpensive tool for tracing sediment sources from different kinds of loess.

Developing fully compatible taper and volume equations for all stem components of <i>Eucalyptus globoidea</i> Blakely trees in New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF FORESTRY SCIENCE												Background: Individual-tree taper and volume equations are essential for forest management. They provide estimates of volume that are incorporated into plot-level volume equations and also into growth and yield models to estimate volumes per hectare in forest crops. Moreover, taper equations allow forest managers to estimate dimensions of logs that can be cut from stems in their forests when they have measured diameters at breast height and heights of trees in inventories. Compatible taper and volume equations have the property that the same individual tree volume can be estimated either from the tree volume equation or by integrating the taper equation. Durable eucalypt species such as Eucalyptus globoidea Blakely, however, have especially valuable heartwood and so managers require estimates of the volumes and shapes of heartwood zones within trees. Simple overall wood taper and volume equations would therefore be inadequate. Methods: 74 Eucalyptus globoidea trees were destructively sampled in 8 different trial plots throughout New Zealand. Tree ages were 7 to 29 years old, the DBHs were 11 to 67.6 cm and the heights were 7.2 to 35.4 m. All trees were felled and lengths and taper diameters outside bark were measured. To measure taper diameters of heartwood and sapwood, discs were cut at irregular intervals along the stems. Heartwood and sapwood components were identified by applying methyl orange dye and quantified using image analysis. In this study we extended compatibility so that sums of estimated volumes of separate components of stems, bark, sapwood and heartwood, would equal overall tree volume estimates. In addition, taper equations were made for outside bark, inside bark and heartwood that were compatible with their respective volume equations. Parameters of five volume equations for whole stem, whole wood, bark, sapwood, and heartwood were simultaneously estimated. Compatible taper equations for whole stem, stem wood and heartwood were estimated so that they were compatible with the volume equations, thereby creating a fully compatible system. Results: Root mean squared error (RMSE) of volume models were 0.1248298 m(3) for heartwood, 0.05496807 m(3) for sapwood, 0.1539625 m(3) for wood inside bark, 0.1108201 m(3) for bark and 0.1439786 m(3) for wood including bark. RMSE of taper models was 2.572765 cm for heartwood, 2.348552 cm for wood inside bark and 2.474088 cm for wood including bark. Conclusions: A compatible system of multiple taper and volume equations can be fitted through the simultaneous fitting of parameters with minimal bias and precision levels of +/- 0.055-0.154 m(3) for volume equations and +/- 2.35 to 2.57 cm for taper equations. Leave-one-out cross-validation of the fitted models yielded very similar levels of precision and bias to those encountered when fitting models with the entire dataset.

J	Yang, Y; Dou, YX; Cheng, H; An, SS				Yang, Yang; Dou, Yanxing; Cheng, Huan; An, Shaoshan			Plant functional diversity drives carbon storage following vegetation restoration in Loess Plateau, China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Ongoing climatic changes induced by human activities increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), which have considerable effects on the structure and function of ecosystems, including carbon (C) storage, plant functional traits and therefore on a wide set of ecosystem services. Plant functional diversity is benefit to improve plant photosynthesis and enhance C efficiency and therefore decrease CO2. Here, the focus of this article is on integrating of plant functional diversity and C storage, which aims to contribute to C sequestration for climate change mitigation following vegetation restoration in Loess Plateau, China. Firstly, the CWM (plant community-weighted mean) traits of the most abundant plant species can account for C storage in AGBC (above-ground biomass C), ALC (above-ground litter C), STC (soil total carbon) and TEC (total ecosystem carbon). Secondly, the CWM of plant height and LCC (leaf carbon concentration) had a positive effect C storage in different part (AGBC, ALC, STC and TEC), while the CWM of LNC (leaf nitrogen concentration) and SLA (specific leaf area) had a negative effect on C storage in different part. Further, the CWM of plant height, LCC, SLA and plant functional dispersion (FDis) can be used to predict C storage by multiple linear regression analysis. Finally, the positive association between FDis and C storage was found in SEM, shedding light on the key role of plant functional diversity driving C storage following vegetation restoration. The findings presented here highlight the importance of both plant traits of dominant species and plant functional diversity in regulating C storage, and show that favorable climate conditions, particularly vegetation restoration, tend to increase C storage and plant functional diversity, which have important implications for improving global C cycling and ecosystem services.

Flea infestation, social contact, and stress in a gregarious rodent species: minimizing the potential parasitic costs of group-living	PARASITOLOGY												Both parasitism and social contact are common sources of stress that many gregarious species encounter in nature. Upon encountering such stressors, individuals secrete glucocorticoids and although short-term elevation of glucocorticoids is adaptive, long-term increases are correlated with higher mortality and deleterious reproductive effects. Here, we used an experimental host-parasite system, social rodents Acomys cahirinus and their characteristic fleas Parapulex chephrenis, in a fully-crossed design to test the effects of social contact and parasitism on stress during pregnancy. By analysing faecal glucocorticoid metabolites, we found that social hierarchy did not have a significant effect on glucocorticoid concentration. Rather, solitary females had significantly higher glucocorticoid levels than females housed in pairs. We found a significant interaction between the stressors of parasitism and social contact with solitary, uninfested females having the highest faecal glucocorticoid metabolite levels suggesting that both social contact and infestation mitigate allostatic load in pregnant rodents.

We hypothesized that in the semiarid region of the Loess Plateau, with more precipitation, more nitrogen fertilizer is needed for the optimal wheat yield. Here, the following three nitrogen treatments were tested over 5 years at the Wenxi Experimental Station: 90 kg center dot ha(-1), 150 kg center dot ha(-1), and 210 kg center dot ha(-1), designated as N90, N150, and N210, respectively. The yield was classified into three levels: high, intermediate, and low. The relationships between dominant yield components and dry matter, nitrogen translocation accumulation, and nitrogen use efficiency were studied. A high yield was achieved by increasing the spike number and 1000-kernel weight. Spike number was related to pre-anthesis nitrogen translocation, while 1000-kernel weight was related to pre-anthesis dry matter translocation, as well as pre-anthesis and post-anthesis nitrogen accumulation. Additionally, the regulation of nitrogen fertilizer use was related to precipitation distribution. Sufficient precipitation during fallow and early plant growth stages promoted high yields. In years precipitation occurs in short supply, once accumulated precipitation has reached a threshold at the late plant growth stage, increasing nitrogen fertilizer application can improve yield. Grain yield under the N210 treatment was highest in wet years, whereas N150 allowed for the highest grain yield in normal or dry years.

Understanding this is important for the management of the planted forest. The present study explored the dynamics of afforested forest carbon pool in a semiarid sandy ecosystem, northwest China. We studied afforested forests of pine (Pinus sylvestris) of five afforestation ages (20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 years since planting, and bare sand as control), the carbon storage and carbon sequestration rate of the forest aboveground biomass layer, surface litter layer, and soil layer (0-50 cm) were calculated, and the soil water content and soil organic carbon of 0-400 cm soil depth were measured. The results showed that the carbon sequestration rate was highest after 20-30 years, with 0.58 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in the soil layer (0-50 cm). We found a rate of 0.13 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in the surface litter layer, and a rate of 20.79 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in the forest aboveground biomass layer. The carbon storage of the forest aboveground biomass layer was highest after 30-40 years, and the carbon storage of the surface litter increased with time. In the soil layer, the carbon storage at 0-10 cm depth was highest after 60 years, the carbon storage at 20-50 cm depth increased soon after afforestation and then decreased afterward with increasing afforestation ages with the maximum for 20-50 cm occurring after 30-40 years. The total carbon storage [the forest aboveground biomass layer, surface litter layer and soil layer (0-50 cm)] was higher when afforestation ages reached around 30 years, after that it decreased with increasing afforestation age. Our research improves the understanding of the P. sylvestris forest ecosystem carbon sequestration in a semiarid sandy area.

Although the variations of bulk SOC have been extensively studied, the driving mechanisms of variations in SOC fractions, i.e., carbon in coarse particulate, fine particulate, and mineral-associated organic matter (CPOM-C, FPOM-C, and MAOM-C), and their relationship with soil erosion remain unclear on sloping farmland. In this study, two areas of farmland with different slope types (convex vs. straight) and reclamation periods (50 years vs. >= 100 years) in the black soil region of Northeastern China were chosen to explore the roles of soil erosion on the variations of SOC and their size fractions based on the 137Cs tracer technique. The results showed that the average net erosion rate of the straight slope was 2810.09 t km-2a-1 and the convex slope was 3801.71 t km-2a-1 with higher spatial variability. When compared with uncultivated land, SOC contents of convex and straight slopes have decreased by 13.58% and 35.18%, with a reduced rate of 0.089 g kg-1 a-1 and 0.116 g kg-1 a-1, respectively. Although the CPOM-C fraction showed the most significant relative decreases (over 73.24%), the absolute declines of MAOM-C were more significant, especially in the straight slope with a more extended cultivation period. The contributions of erosion to the SOC decreases on convex and straight slopes were 69.54% and 13.09%, respectively. Erosion exerted a significant influence on finer particles such as FPOM-C and MAOM-C. With increasing cumulative erosion, the absolute magnitude of each SOC fraction in soils decreased. But the proportion of MAOM-C increased, while FPOM-C and CPOM-C decreased. Overall, our findings demonstrated that soil erosion not only induced the loss of SOC fractions but also transformed the proportional distribution of their fractions, and then affected the functions of SOC. Moreover, the effects of tillage (i.e., an increase in microbial activity) on straight slopes are not negligible in farmland that has experi-enced long-term cultivation but relatively little erosion. Apart from erosion reduction in areas of severe erosion, appropriate fertilization for farmland with a long history of cultivation should also be adapted to achieve sus-tainable development of black soil resources.

Design/methodology/approach A total of 416 household heads were involved in a questionnaire survey using a multistage sampling approach. To understand the socio-economic factors that influence farmers' perception on climate change (CC) and/or variability, a binary logit model was used. Multinomial logit model was used to identify the determinants of smallholder farmers' choices of adaptation strategies. Findings Milk reduction, weight loss, feed shortage and frequent animal disease outbreak were indicated as major impacts of CC on livestock production. About 86.2% of the farmers' exercise CCA measures where livestock health care and management (25%), followed by livelihood diversification (21.5%) and shifting and diversification of livestock species (20.9%) were the top three adaptation measures implemented. Education, knowledge on CCA strategies, access to veterinary service and extension, market access, annual income, non-farm income, total livestock unit, sex of household head and household size were the major determinant factors to farmers' choice of CCA. Research limitations/implications Concerned authorities working in CC related sectors should give due attention to improve smallholder farmers' access to extension and veterinary services, market access and climate information to enhance their adaptive capacity to CC impacts. In addition, incorporating climate change awareness trainings into the existing extension packages is crucial to enhance the awareness of farmers on climate change and implement appropriate adaptation strategies. Moreover, it is very essential to provide appropriate herd management and marketing strategy based on the production system to avoid the significant price reduction during drought periods.

AMF can also affect the outcome of interspecific interactions, but a mechanistic understanding of how soil N availability affects AMF-mediated interspecific relationships is currently lacking. We selected one dominant (Bothriochloa ischaemum; C-4 grass) and one subordinate (Lespedeza davurica; legume) species in a natural grassland climax community to investigate the mechanism by which AMF influence interspecific interaction (mixed and monoculture) under three levels of N addition (0, low, and high N addition). Under the non-N addition treatment, AMF preferentially supplied N to the roots of B. ischaemum at the expense of N uptake by L. davurica, resulting in inhibited AMF benefits for L. davurica shoot growth. Under the low N addition treatment, interspecific interaction via AMF promoted L. davurica growth. Compared to the non-N addition treatment, N addition largely mitigated the effects, both positive (for B. ischaemum) and negative (for L. davurica), of AMF-mediated interspecific interaction on plant N uptake via AMF. When soil N availability severely limited plant growth, preferential N supply to the C-4 grass by AMF was important for maintaining the abundance of the dominant species. When the N limitation for plant growth was alleviated by N addition, the interaction between AMF and soil microorganisms improved nutrient availability for the legume by stimulating activity of the enzyme responsible for soil organic matter mineralization, which is important for maintaining the abundance of the subordinate species. These data could influence strategies for maintaining biodiversity.					yang, zhou/JKI-3744-2023; XIONG, LIU/JOK-5886-2023; li, bai/JNE-1502-2023	Hongfei, Liu/0000-0003-4391-0031; Xu, Hongwei/0000-0002-3628-3378													0032-0889	1532-2548				NOV	2021	187	3					1519	1533		10.1093/plphys/kiab328	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plphys/kiab328		JUL 2021						34618052					WOS:000720751600042

Apart from depleting topsoil, incising gullies, and waterlogging depositional sites, slope-scale erosion also spatially redistributes soil nutrients and introduces localized soil degradation. This requires to systematically understanding topography-specific spatial distribution patterns of eroded soil compositions and the relative abundance of each nutrient at different topographic settings. In this study, topsoil at predetermined space intervals were collected from two adjacent but differently curved segments (convex vs. concave) on a sloped cropland in northeastern China. The spatial distributions of topsoil soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP), and the variations of their atomic ratios were compared. Our results show that (1) Compared with the nearby undisturbed tree rows, the SOC and TN was halved on the investigated slope, demonstrating great degradation since the land use conversion. (2) The spatial distribution of topsoil nutrients were evidently topography specific, with the SOC being comparable at slope summit, but declining from 27.57 to 4.72 g kg(-1) (depletion ratio of 0.17) at the convex segment meanwhile accumulating up to 34.71 g kg(-1) (enrichment ratio of 1.26) at the concave segment. Similar but more deviated spatial patterns were also observed on the TN and TP. (3) The atomic ratios of C:N:P also differed as the slope curvatures diverted, by being more variable from 51:3:1 to 105:6:1 along the convex segment but rather stable between 74:5:1 and 89:5:1 along the concave segment (4) The lower content of SOC and the heavier delta C-13 along the convex segment suggest more advanced mineralization of C and thus greater susceptibility of C-limitation. Meanwhile, the slightly lower C:N ratios and the greater delta N-15 along the concave segment indicate greater stability of C, more advanced mineralization of N and thus likely a N-limited process. Overall, our findings demonstrate the controlling influences of minor geomorphic features to on-site soil dislocation and localized degradation at slope scale. Apart from general soil conservation measures, topography-specific practices must also be integrated to local land use policy to effectively target localized land degradation.

Long-term impact of organic and inorganic fertilizers on soil organic carbon dynamics in a rice- wheat system	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Deep soil carbon (C) plays an important role in the global carbon cycle because it is more recalcitrant and remains in the soil for a longer period. Yet, very few studies have reported the impact of long-term fertilization on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics in deep soil in a rice-wheat system (RWS). Hence, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the long-term fertilization impact on carbon sequestration and C pools in RWS in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) of India. Application of 90 kg N, 20 kg P and 25 kg K ha(-1) through mineral fertilizers (NPK) + green gram incorporation (GR) + 30 kg N ha(-1) through farmyard manure (FYM) sequestered more C (25.86 Mg ha(-1)) in the 0-105 cm soil depth compared with mineral fertilizer alone (1.25 Mg ha(-1)). The C-sequestration rate ranged between 0.61 to 1.23 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) under treatments having organic fertilizer and mineral fertilizer, whereas it varied from 0.06 to 0.39 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in the treatments receiving mineral fertilizer only. Total C and critical C input were 197 Mg kg(-1) and 1.94 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively under NPK + GR + FYM treatment. Integrated application of mineral fertilizers and organics in treatments NPK + FYM, NPK + SPM (sulphitation press mud), NPK + GR, NPK + GR + FYM and NPK + CR (crop residue) resulted in higher sustainable yield index of RWS compared to mineral fertilizer alone. We conclude that application of organic material along with mineral fertilizers is essential to mitigate the atmospheric C load through C-sequestration in deep soils and to attain sustainable RWS productivity in the IGP.

Therefore, the prediction of drug-target interactions (DTIs) is important for disease therapy. Incorporating multiple similarity measures for drugs and targets is of essence for improving the accuracy of prediction of DTIs. However, existing studies with multiple similarity measures ignored the global structure information of similarity measures, and required manual extraction features of drug-target pairs, ignoring the non-linear relationship among features. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach MDADTI for DTIs prediction based on MDA. MDADTI applied random walk with restart method and positive pointwise mutual information to calculate the topological similarity matrices of drugs and targets, capturing the global structure information of similarity measures. Then, MDADTI applied multimodal deep autoencoder to fuse multiple topological similarity matrices of drugs and targets, automatically learned the low-dimensional features of drugs and targets, and applied deep neural network to predict DTIs. The results of 5-repeats of 10-fold cross-validation under three different cross-validation settings indicated that MDADTI is superior to the other four baseline methods. In addition, we validated the predictions of the MDADTI in six drug-target interactions reference databases, and the results showed that MDADTI can effectively identify unknown DTIs.

Wood traits, which vary by tree species, can influence decomposition aboveground, but it is not well understood how wood decomposition associated with different tree types (i.e., angiosperm and gymnosperm species) influences underlying soil nutrient concentrations and enzyme activities. In this study, we evaluated how tree type (for four angiosperm vs. four gymnosperm species) affects underlying soil total carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) concentrations; microbial biomass C, N, and P concentrations; and C-, N-, and P-acquiring enzymes activities. We found that decomposing wood significantly increased soil total P, and microbial biomass C and P concentrations. However, the differences in the nutrient concentrations of soil and microbial biomass beneath decomposing wood were not different between angiosperm and gymnosperm species. Surprisingly, the activities of soil C-, N-, and P-acquiring enzymes beneath the decomposing wood differed significantly between angiosperm and gymnosperm species. The soils beneath decomposing angiosperm wood had higher P-acquiring enzyme activity, while the soils beneath gymnosperm wood had higher C- and N-acquiring enzyme activities. The soils beneath angiosperm and gymnosperm wood had a similar C-limitation for microbial metabolism, but the microbial metabolism in soils beneath angiosperm wood was more P-limited compared to soils beneath gymnosperm wood. In conclusion, our findings highlight that the tree types of decomposing wood may affect underlying soil enzyme activities and enzyme characteristics, improving our ability to accurately predict the role of wood decomposition on forest nutrient cycles.

J	Liu, Y; Walling, D; Yang, MY; Zhang, FB				Liu, Ying; Walling, Des E.; Yang, Mingyi; Zhang, Fengbao			Sediment source fingerprinting and the temporal variability of source contributions	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Sediment source fingerprinting has been progressively developed and refined over the past 40 years or more and now represents a widely used and valuable technique, with important practical applications. However, relatively little attention has been given to the target samples and the extent to which they are able to provide meaningful information on short- or longer-term relative source contributions for a given study catchment. A key issue here is the inherent short- and longer-term temporal variability of source contributions and the extent to which such variability is taken into account by the target samples. The objective of this study was to investigate the temporal variation of source contributions from the Qiaozi West catchment, a small (1.09 km2) gully catchment located within the Loess Plateau of China. The target samples represented a suite of 214 spot suspended sediment samples collected during eight representative wet season rainfall events occurring over two years. A suite of geochemical properties was used as fingerprints and standard source apportionment calculations indicated that the gully walls contributed the most sediment (load-weighted mean 54.5%) and, together with cropland (loadweighted mean 37.3%), and gully slopes (load-weighed mean 6.6%) were the main sediment sources. The 214 individual target samples indicated that the contribution of cropland sources varied between 8.3% and 60.4%, gully walls between 22.9% and 85.8% and gully slopes between 1.1% and 30.7%, representing ranges of 52.1%, 62.9% and 29.6% respectively. In order to explore whether the temporal variability of source contributions demonstrated by the study catchment should be seen as typical, equivalent information was abstracted from 14 published studies for other catchments of varying size and located in different environments worldwide. This information demonstrated similar temporal variability of the relative contributions of the major sources, which were typically characterized by ranges of the order of 30-70%. The temporal variability associated with the estimates of relative source contributions provided by target samples has important implications for the uncertainty associated with such estimates derived using source fingerprinting techniques based on a limited number of target samples. Further attention needs to be directed to the design of sampling programmes used to collect such samples and to taking account of such uncertainty in source apportionment calculations.						yang, ming yi/0000-0003-2574-552X; Zhang, Fengbao/0000-0003-1003-256X													0301-4797	1095-8630				JUL 15	2023	338								117835	10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.117835	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.117835		APR 2023						37019022					WOS:000970690100001

In northern China, the effects of green manure on production of the region?s major crops have been extensively investigated, but the inconsistent conclusions that these case studies have yielded cannot provide effective guidance for practical local agricultural production. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to generate a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of green manure on soil properties and crop yield in this region. Our results shown that green manure improves soil quality effectively, decreasing soil bulk density by - 5.6 %, increasing microbial biomass carbon by 28 %, and improving the activities of soil enzymes by 14 % - 39 %. Among the different types of green manure, legume green manure more markedly increased both nitrate and hydrolysable nitrogen, while non-legume green manure more markedly increased available potassium. Soil gravimetric water content was decreased under green manure treatment. Maize yield was significantly increased under green manure by 11 % on the whole, while effects of green manure on wheat and potato were inconsistent. In summary, the application of green manure in northern China can improve soil quality significantly, and proper green manure use can improve cash crop yields.

J	Wang, D; Wang, L				Wang, Di; Wang, Li			Rainfall partitioning and its effects on regional water balances: Evidence from the conversion of traditional cropland to apple orchards in a semi-humid region	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Rainfall partitioning by vegetation cover plays an important role in local and regional water balances. Large areas of traditional cropland have been converted to apple orchards on the Loess Plateau, China, so the effect of the conversion of traditional cropland to these orchards on rainfall partitioning cannot be ignored. In this study, we measured precipitation, throughfall (TF), and stemflow (SF) and calculated canopy interception (I) and canopy storage capacity (S) in two neighbouring apple orchards (8 and 18 years old in 2013) on the plateau during the four growing seasons of 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. Besides, we also summarized the percentage of rainfall partitioning of various crops and tree species and assessed the effect of land use change on regional water balances. The results showed that the percentage of rainfall partitioning and S differed between the two orchards. Mean annual I, TF, and SF for the young and mature orchards during the 4 years accounted for 7.9, 89.8, and 2.6% and for 10.3, 87.5, and 2.3%, respectively, of the rainfall partitioning. The percentage accounted for by mean annual I and TF differed significantly between the two orchards, but the percentage of mean annual SF did not differ significantly between the two orchards. Mean annual S for 2013-2016 was significantly higher for the mature than the young orchard. Although the conversion of traditional cropland to apple orchards led to a more serious soil desiccation in this region, the I loss percentage was higher in maize (12.5%) than the apple orchards. Therefore, we inferred that the effect of the conversion of traditional cropland to apple orchards on regional water balances was likely not caused by differences in rainfall partitioning. Differences in tree morphology due to tree age accounted for the differences in rainfall partitioning and S between the two orchards. Thus, tree age should be taken into account when assessing the effect of apple orchards on rainfall partitioning in this or similar regions.

PLANT GROWTH REGULATION												Alternative splicing (AS) plays crucial roles during plant development especially in stress responses. Although many studies have been performed on AS, the function of which participating in abiotic stress responses is still not well known. To assess the interplay between AS and salt stress, genome-wide analyses of AS were performed. Totally, 11,141 genes were found exhibiting significant AS changes after salt stress treatment, and more AS events were identified in Chinese Spring (CS, salt-sensitive) (21,203) than in Qing Mai 6 (QM, salt-tolerant) (19,742). Meanwhile, wheat homeologous genes displayed differential AS responses under salt stress treatment, and 7235, 8143 and 7407 AS events were identified on subgenome A, B and D respectively. Comparison of AS events at different time after salt stress showed that 4747 and 4129 salt stress responsive AS events were characterized in CS and QM, respectively, and most AS events were induced at 48 h after salt stress (HAS) compared with the other three stages. Functional enrichment analysis found that abiotic stress responsive pathways tended to be enriched in partitioned differentially spliced genes (DSGs) between CS and QM after salt stress treatment, and Pfam classification showed that many stress related proteins were also enriched under salt stress condition. Thus, these results demonstrated that AS regulation may play key roles in response to salt stress, which, together with transcriptional regulation, contributes to abiotic stress tolerance in wheat.

To discover resistance characteristics of overland flow influenced by rainfall intensity and roughness, indoor simulated rainfall experiments with six kinds of roughness, five flow discharges, and five rainfall intensities were investigated. Results showed that overland flow over rough surfaces could be considered as laminar and turbulent flow when using flow Reynolds number. According to roll waves observed, flow regimes belonged to the laminar transitional zone based on the viscosity-to-depth ratio. A critical water depth formula for overland flow was re-derived, and it showed that this test water flow consisted of supercritical flow in most cases, and subcritical flow in only a few cases. The flow resistance coefficient increased with increasing roughness, whereas it decreased as rainfall intensity increased. Considering the 'increasing resistance' phenomenon, this study focused on frictional resistance, thickness of the viscous sublayer, pressure drag and roll waves. Finally, a formula for sheet flow resistance was proposed based on resistance segmentation and multi-element linear regression. These findings are of significance both for understanding the characteristics and development of overland flow and overland flow dynamics.					wang, jing/HJA-5384-2022; Wang, Jin/GYA-2019-2022; wang, jie/HTQ-4920-2023; wang, jing/GVT-8700-2022; wang, dan/JEF-0836-2023; wang, jiahui/IXD-1197-2023; wang, jing/GRS-7509-2022														0029-1277	2224-7955				OCT	2019	50	5					1324	1343		10.2166/nh.2019.261	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2019.261													WOS:000491432000010

Spatial and temporal variation of compositional, functional, and phylogenetic diversity in ectoparasite infracommunities harboured by small mammals	PARASITOLOGY												We studied patterns of compositional, functional, and phylogenetic alpha- and beta-diversity in flea and gamasid mite infracommunities of small Siberian mammals, taking into account host-associated (species) and environmental (biome or sampling period) factors. We asked: (a) How do these factors and their interactions affect infracommunity diversity? (b) Does infracommunity composition, in terms of species, traits, and phylogenetic lineages, deviate from random? (c) Are species, traits, and phylogenetic lineages in infracommunities clustered or overdispersed?, and (d) Do patterns of diversity differ between the three diversity facets and/or the two ectoparasite taxa? We found that the alpha-diversity of infracommunities was strongly affected by host species, biome, and sampling period. The highest proportion of infracommunity diversity in both taxa was associated with the interaction between either host species and biome or host species and sampling period. Infracommunities of both taxa within, as well as between, host species, biomes, and sampling periods were characterized by the clustering of species, traits and lineages. The patterns of the effects of host species, biome, and sampling period on infracommunity diversity were congruent among the three diversity facets in both fleas and mites. We conclude that the assembly patterns in ectoparasite infracommunities mirror those characteristics of component and compound communities.

J	Kingwell, R				Kingwell, Ross			Making Agriculture Carbon Neutral Amid a Changing Climate: The Case of South-Western Australia	LAND												Making Australian agriculture carbon neutral by 2050 is a goal espoused by several agricultural organisations in Australia. How costly might it be to attain that goal, especially when adverse climate change projections apply to agriculture in southern Australia? This study uses scenario analysis to examine agricultural emissions and their abatement via reforestation in south-western Australia under projected climate change. Most scenarios include the likelihood of agricultural emissions being reduced in the coming decades. However, the impact of projected adverse climate change on tree growth and tree survival means that the cost of achieving agricultural carbon neutrality via reforestation is forecast to increase in south-western Australia. Agricultural R & D and innovation that enable agricultural emissions to diminish in the coming decades will be crucial to lessen the cost of achieving carbon neutrality. On balance, the more likely scenarios reveal the real cost of achieving carbon neutrality will not greatly increase. The cost of achieving carbon neutrality under the various scenarios is raised by an additional AUD22 million to AUD100 million per annum in constant 2020 dollar terms. This magnitude of cost increase is very small relative to the region's gross value of agricultural production that is regularly greater than AUD10 billion.					郭, 青霞/GZH-2618-2022	Kingwell, Ross/0000-0003-0324-9488														2073-445X				NOV	2021	10	11							1259	10.3390/land10111259	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land10111259													WOS:000727593300001

Many strains of this pathogen produce fumonisin myotoxins that are harmful to human and animal health. This study was conducted to determine the fumonisin-producing ability of isolates of F. verticillioides isolated from maize kernels collected from different maize-growing areas of the country. Eighty F. verticillioides isolates were grown on autoclaved maize cultures for one month, and the fumonisin content was quantified using Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). All the 80 isolates evaluated were able to produce detectable levels of total fumonisins in the maize culture with values ranging from 0.25 to 38.01 mg of the toxin per kg of culture material (fungal biomass and maize kernels). The mean levels of total fumonisins produced by the F. verticillioides isolates were not significantly (p>0.05) different among maize-growing areas, however, the total fumonisins levels produced by isolates obtained from the same area as well as agroecological zones were wide-ranging. The results indicate that the majority (57.5%) of the F. verticillioides isolates associated with maize grains in Ethiopia produced total fumonisins >4 mg/kg, while 35% of the isolates produced total fumonisins <2 mg/kg. The widespread occurrence of higher fumonisin-producing strains across all maize -growing areas in Ethiopia indicates a possible food safety risk. Thus, efforts should be made to prevent the spread of this fungus with good agronomic practices and to implore all possible ways to avoid maize contamination with fumonisin both in the field and in storage.

However, the seasonal characteristics of stoichiometry in plants, litter, and soil are poorly understood, especially in plantation ecosystems. Therefore, we explored the seasonal variations of C, N, and P contents and ratios between plants, litter, and soil of a Robinia pseudoacacia plantation on the Loess Plateau in China in 2017. The results indicate that the C, N, P contents and ratios in plants, litter and soil showed different seasonal patterns. The N and P contents of tree and shrub leaves substantially decreased over the growing season, while the C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios exhibited the opposite trend. The utilization efficiency of the N and P elements by trees and shrubs gradually increased with the change of the growing season. These results suggest that the C:N:P stoichiometry of plants was more sensitive to seasonal changes than the litter and soil; therefore, the potential impacts of time should be considered when using stoichiometry to explore the utilization of plant nutrients. Additionally, the P content between tree leaves and soil and the N content between herb leaves and soil were significantly positively correlated, indicating that the growth of the tree and herb layer in the R. pseudoacacia plantation in the area was restricted by P and N, respectively. Meanwhile, the N content in the leaves between trees and herbs showed a significant negative correlation, indicating that N competition existed between R. pseudoacacia and understory herbs, which was not conducive to the effective use of environmental resources by the R. pseudoacacia plantation ecosystem. This study contributes to vegetation restoration and plantation management on the Loess Plateau and provides basic information for global stoichiometric analyses.

Accurate models are of significant importance for agriculture, water resources management, hydrological simulation, and species distribution. In this study, we examined the precipitation and temperature reproducibility of 34 GCMs during the period from 1961 to 1999 over arid and semiarid regions of China. The study area was divided into eight sub-regions; each represented a specific topography. The evaluation was conducted for the whole study area and the sub-regions. Spatial and temporal indices and weighting methodology were used to comprehensively illustrate the models' reproducibility. The results showed that the simulation ability during winter outperformed than that during summer (the weight was 0.192 higher for precipitation and 0.044 higher for temperature during winter than that during summer over the whole study area). Precipitation was more accurately simulated during spring than during autumn as opposed to temperature ( the weight was 0.124 higher during spring than during autumn for precipitation and 0.1 higher during autumn than during spring for temperature for the whole region). For precipitation, the simulation ability in the basins was the best, followed by plateaus and mountains; the weights were 0.462, 0.308, and 0231, respectively. For temperature, the mountains and plateaus had the best and poorest reproducibility, at weights of 0.446 and 0.198, respectively. The top models for precipitation and temperature at different spatial scales (whole study area, three topography types, eight sub-regions) were recommended. The results served as a reference for model selection in future studies regarding impacts of climate change on eco-hydrology. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, how these factors affect binding agents and soil aggregate stability along a climatic gradient remained unclear. We selected the Robinia pseudoacacia L. forests from semi-arid to semi-humid of the Loess Plateau, China to analyze the plant biomass, soil physical-chemical properties, SOC and GRSP distribution in different sized soil aggregates. We found that from semi-arid to semi-humid forests: (1) the proportion of macro-aggregates (>0.250 mm) significantly increased (P<0.05), whereas those of micro-aggregates (0.250-0.053 mm) and fine materials (<0.053 mm) decreased and soil aggregate stability was increased; (2) the contents of SOC and GRSP in macro-aggregates and micro-aggregates significantly increased, and those in fine materials decreased; (3) the contribution of SOC to soil aggregate stability was greater than those of total GRSP and easily extractable GRSP; (4) soil properties had greater influence on binding agents than plant biomass; and (5) soil aggregate stability was enhanced by increasing the contents of SOC and GRSP in macro-aggregates and soil property was the important part during this process. Climate change from semi-arid to semi-humid forests is important factor for soil structure formation because of its positive effect on soil aggregates.

Moreover, legume-rhizobium symbiosis has gained increasing attention in mitigating heavy metal stress. However, systematic regulatory mechanisms used for the exogenous application of signaling molecules to alter the resistance of legume-rhizobium symbiosis under metal stress are currently unknown. In this study, we examined the exogenous effects of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) as an NO donor additive and sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) as a H2S donor additive on the phytotoxicity and soil quality of alfalfa (Medicago sativa)-rhizobium symbiosis in lead/cadmium (Pb/Cd)-contaminated soils. Results showed that rhizobia inoculation markedly promoted alfalfa growth by increasing chlorophyll content, fresh weight, and plant height and biomass. Compared to the inoculated rhizobia treatment alone, the addition of NO and H2S significantly reduced the bioaccumulation of Pb and Cd in alfalfa-rhizobium symbiosis, respectively, thus avoiding the phytotoxicity caused by the excessive presence of metals. The addition of signaling molecules also alleviated metal-induced phytotoxicity by increasing antioxidant enzyme activity and inhibiting the level of lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in legume-rhizobium symbiosis. Also, signaling molecules improved soil nutrient cycling, increased soil enzyme activities, and promoted rhizosphere bacterial community diversity. Both partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) and variation partitioning analysis (VPA) identified that using signaling molecules can improve plant growth by regulating major controlling variables (i.e., soil enzymes, soil nutrients, and microbial diversity/plant oxidative damage) in legume-rhizobium symbiosis. This study offers integrated insight that confirms that the exogenous application of signaling molecules can enhance the resistance of legume-rhizobium symbiosis under metal toxicity by regulating the biochemical response of the plant-soil system, thereby minimizing potential health risks.

A 35-year (1984-2019) long-term experiment under winter wheat-broomcorn millet and pea (W + M/P) was undertaken to investigate soil aggregation and aggregate associated P fractions using Hedley sequential fractionation method in the 60 cm soil profile of Northwest China. Treatments included (1) unfertilized control (CK), P fertilizer (P), N combined with P (NP), and NP plus farmyard manure (NPM). A settling tube apparatus was used to fractionate the soils physically into four sizes (> 250-, 125-250-, 63-125-, and < 63 mu m) aggregates. Results indicated long-term P fertilization regimes had no striking effects on promoting the size distribution of aggregates except for > 250 mu m in the 0-60 soil depths, where NPM treatment significantly increased the mass proportion by 50.7% at 0-20 cm, 78.8% at 20-40 cm, and 36.1% at 40-60 cm depths over CK, respectively. Compared with CK, long-term P fertilization markedly raised aggregate associated P fraction at 0-60 cm soil depths. In particular, the average labile P in all size aggregates increased by 93%, 63%, and 170%, moderately labile P by 117%, 118%, and 127%, and non-labile P by 324%, 268%, and 345%, respectively, under the P, NP, and NPM treatment that contributed higher in large (> 250 mu m) size aggregate than others. Our results suggested that long-term P fertilization, especially mineral P combined with farmyard manure better sustains soil structural stability and promotes soil P transformation and availability in soil aggregates in the soil profile, which would have environmental consequences. Therefore, P management needs to modify based on monitoring soil nutrients and P fractions over time.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of spatial distributions of grass strips on soil erosion in spoil tips. A field runoff plot (20 m long, 1 m wide, and 0.5 m deep) was used for inflow simulation experiments under four inflow rate patterns (even, rising, falling, and rising-falling) and five grass strip patterns (patterns I-V). Results showed that the runoff reduction benefit (RRB) and soil loss reduction benefit (SLRB) of grass strip patterns were 12.23-49.62% and 12.92-80.54%, respectively. The optimal grass strip pattern was when the grass strips were distributed on a slope in bands (pattern V). In this pattern, the soil and water conservation effects were best, with RRB and SLRB of 43.87% and 58.09%, respectively. The grass strip patterns exhibited a significant time-limited effect on controlling soil erosion. The maximum amount of soil loss reduction for patterns II, III, IV, and V was 93.02, 84.30, 65.86, and 98.26 kg, respectively. Soil loss reduction caused by decreasing runoff (SRR) for grass strip patterns was the main factor controlling erosion. The efficiency coefficient of soil loss reduction caused by decreasing runoff for pattern V was higher than that for the other patterns. The grass strip pattern V (i.e., grass strips were distributed on a slope in bands) should be considered a priority in the prevention of soil erosion in spoil tips. This study can guide the configuration of vegetation control measures for soil and water loss in spoil tips.																				2073-4441				MAR	2022	14	6							913	10.3390/w14060913	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14060913													WOS:000774630400001

We examined the mechanism by which the addition of P affects interspecific interactions between a C4 grass (Bothriochloa ischaemum, a dominant species in natural grasslands) and a C3 legume (Lespedeza davurica, a subordinate species in natural grasslands) via AMF and plant growth, by continuous C-13 and N-15 labelling, combined with soil enzyme analyses. The results of N-15 labelling revealed that P addition affected the shoot uptake of N via AMF by B. ischaemum and L. davurica differently. Specifically, the addition of P significantly increased the shoot uptake of N via AMF by B. ischaemum but significantly decreased that by L. davurica. Interspecific plant interactions via AMF significantly facilitated the plant N uptake via AMF by B. ischaemum but significantly inhibited that by L. davurica under P-limited soil conditions, whereas the opposite effect was observed in the case of excess P. This was consistent with the impact of interspecific plant interaction via AMF on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) benefit for plant growth. Our data indicate that the capability of plant N uptake via AMF is an important mechanism that influences interspecific relationships between C4 grasses and C3 legumes. Moreover, the effect of AMF on the activities of the soil enzymes responsible for N and P mineralization substantially contributed to the consequence of interspecific plant interaction via AMF for plant growth.					li, bai/JNE-1502-2023; yang, zhou/JKI-3744-2023; XIONG, LIU/JOK-5886-2023	Xu, Hongwei/0000-0002-3628-3378; xue, sha/0000-0002-4452-8726													0960-7412	1365-313X				OCT	2021	108	1					183	196		10.1111/tpj.15434	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.15434		AUG 2021						34293218					WOS:000684556500001

To understand the temporal persistence of DSL, a ca. 860 km south-north transect was established and soil water content of the 0-5 m depth soil layer repeatedly measured for a period of four years. The results indicated that DSL varied with time and had a distribution area over 21.5-47.0% in the 860 km transect during the study period. The DSL could be divided into temporary and permanent types based on the length of period for which the soil remains dry. While temporary DSL is recoverable, permanent DSL (which existed in 47 out of 86 sites) was apparently unrecoverable as it persisted throughout the observation period. Permanent DSL was characterized by high temporal persistence, severe soil desiccation and thick dry layers; all of which suggested severe negative effect on the ecosystem. Non-climatic factors, rather than climate factors, contributed more to the formation of permanent DSL in the study area. Thus, it was suggested that policies and measures should be enacted to control especially permanent DSL formation in the region.

However, the impacts of the slope morphology and position on the spatial distributions of soil nutrients after deforestation and their relationships are unclear, thereby limiting our understanding of the mechanism of soil degradation. In this study, we aimed to identify the relationships between the changes in soil nutrients and the slope morphology (i.e., slopes with different widths or lengths) after deforestation. Soil samples were collected from forestland slopes with different morphologies after deforestation for 28 years in the hilly area of the Loess Plateau, China. We analyzed the effects of the length, width, and position of the slope on the pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), nitrate-N (NO3-), ammonium-N (NH4+), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK) distributions after deforestation. The spatial autocorrelation analysis indicated that the Moran's I index value for soil nutrients was larger on deforested slope than that of forest land, thereby suggesting that deforestation increased the spatial heterogeneity of the soil nutrients. After deforestation, the spatial autocorrelation distances increased for the soil pH and TP, whereas they decreased for SOC, TN, NH4+, NO3-, and AK. The TN, NH4+, and NO3- contents were significantly higher on the narrow slope than the wide slope. Among the three slope lengths, the soil nutrient losses were greater on the longer slope because of the more severe erosion of the slope after deforestation. The slope position significantly affected the distributions of the soil nutrients. In the vertical direction, the soil nutrient contents decreased continuously in the 0-10, 10-20, and 20-40 cm soil layers, but then increased in the 40-60 cm soil layers, mainly due to the eluviation of nutrients to deep soil layers. These results demonstrate that the slope morphology and position should not be overlooked when predicting the responses of soil nutrients to deforestation in the hilly loess region of China.																			0167-8809	1873-2305				NOV 1	2021	321								107615	10.1016/j.agee.2021.107615	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2021.107615		AUG 2021											WOS:000704402800003

They may occur in spatially homogeneous media (oscillons), but quite often emerge in heterogeneous media, such as the auditory system, where localized oscillations are believed to play an important role in frequency discrimination of incoming sound waves. In this paper, we use an amplitude-equation approach to study the spatial profile of the oscillations and the factors that affect it. More specifically, we use a variant of the forced complex Ginzburg-Landau (FCGL) equation to describe an oscillatory system below the Hopf bifurcation with space-dependent Hopf frequency, subject to both parametric and additive forcing. We show that spatial heterogeneity, combined with bistability of system states, results in spatial asymmetry of the localized oscillations. We further identify parameters that control that asymmetry, and characterize the spatial profile of the oscillations in terms of maximum amplitude, location, width and asymmetry. Our results bear qualitative similarities to empirical observation trends that have found in the auditory system. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Shapira, AZ; Gavish, N; Yochelis, A				Shapira, Alon Z.; Gavish, Nir; Yochelis, Arik			Pattern formation aspects of electrically charged tri-stable media with implications to bulk heterojunction in organic photovoltaics	EPL												A common thread in designing electrochemically based renewable energy devices comprises materials that exploit nano-scale morphologies, e.g., supercapacitors, batteries, fuel cells, and bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics. In these devices, however, Coulomb forces often influence the fine nano-details of the morphological structure of active layers leading to a notorious decrease in performance. By focusing on bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics as a case model, a self-consistent mean-field framework that combines binary (bi-stable) and ternary (tri-stable) morphologies with electrokinetics is presented and analyzed, i.e., undertaking the coupling between the spatiotemporal evolution of the material and charge dynamics along with charge transfer at the device electrodes. Particularly, it is shown that tri-stable composition may stabilize stripe morphology that is ideal bulk heterojuction. Moreover, since the results rely on generic principles they are expected to be applicable to a broad range of electrically charged ainphiphilic-type mixtures, such as emulsions, polyelectrolytes, and ionic liquids.

At the ecosystem level, the gross primary productivity (GPP) refers to the amount of organic carbon fixed by plant bodies. How to accurately estimate the spatiotemporal variation of vegetation productivity of the forest ecosystem in the Altay Mountains in northwest China has become a critical issue to be addressed. The Altay Mountains, with rich forest resources, are located in a semi-arid climate zone and are sensitive to global climate changes, which will inevitably have serious impacts on the function and structure of forest ecosystems in northwest China. In this paper, to reveal the variation trends of vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) and its response to surface meteorological factors in the Altay Mountains in northwest China, daily temperature and precipitation data from the period of 2000-2017 were collected from seven meteorological stations in Altay prefecture and its surrounding areas; the data were analyzed by using the MODIS GPP model, moving average trend analysis, linear regression analysis and the climate tendency rate method. The results show that: (1) The spatial distribution pattern of GPP in the whole year was almost the same as that in the growing season of vegetation in the Altay Mountains. In the whole mountain range, the proportion of the area which had a GPP value of 400-600 g c/m(2) had the highest value; the proportion of the annual and growing season of this area was 41.10% and 40.88%, respectively, which was mainly distributed in the middle and west alpine areas of the Altay Mountains. (2) There was a big gap in the GPP value in the different stages of the vegetation growing season (April to September), which reached the highest value in July, the area with a GPP of 100-150 g c/m(2) was the highest, with 36.15%. (3) The GPP of the Altay Mountains showed an overall increasing trend, but the annual fluctuation was relatively large. In 2003, 2008, 2009 and 2014, the GPP showed lower values, which were 385.18 g c/m(2), 384.90 g c/m(2), 384.49 g c/m(2) and 393.10 g c/m(2), respectively. In 2007, 2011 and 2016, the GPP showed higher values, which were 428.49 g c/m(2), 428.18 g c/m(2) and 446.61 g c/m(2). (4) In 64.85% of the area of the Altay Mountains, the GPP was positively correlated with annual average temperature, and in 36.56% of the area, the correlation coefficient between temperature and GPP ranged from -0.2 to 0. In 71.61% of the area of the Altay Mountains, the GPP was positively correlated with annual accumulated precipitation, and in 28.39% of the area, the GPP was negatively correlated with annual accumulated precipitation. Under the scenario of global climate change, our study has quantitatively analyzed the long-term dynamics of vegetation GPP and its responses to meteorological factors in the Altay Mountains, which would be helpful for evaluating and estimating the variation trends of forest ecosystems in China, and has important guiding significance for policy formulation to protect forest resources and improve the local ecological environment.																				1999-4907				NOV	2022	13	11							1907	10.3390/f13111907	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f13111907													WOS:000894904100001

(Aphididae:Hemiptera) on maize, <i>Zea mays</i> (Linn.)	JOURNAL OF AGROMETEOROLOGY												The objective of this study was to examine the development of corn leaf aphid,Rhopalosiphum maidis Fitch (Aphididae: Hemiptera) on maize Zea mays Linnaeus at elevated and ambient concentrations of CO2 (550 and 380ppm +/- 25 ppm, respectively) at six temperatures (20, 25, 27, 30, 33 and 35 degrees C) and to estimate thermal constants and lower temperature thresholds for the forecasting models based on heat accumulation units which could be developed for use in forecasting. The duration of different growth stages of R. maidis were reduced with an increase of temperature from 20 degrees C to 35 degrees C under both ambient and elevated CO2 conditions. The lower development threshold for first nymphal instar, second nymphal instar, third nymphal instar, fourth nymphal instar, adult duration and total development period required 10.1, 5.04, 13.42, 26.96, 10.9, 23.22 and 20.20 degrees C under eCO(2) whereas it was 13.32, 9.41, 19.13, 30.48, 16.38, 22.88 and 20.89 degrees C under aCO(2) conditions,respectively. The mean lower temperature threshold for nymph was slightly higher (16.38 degrees C) at aCO(2) compared to that of eCO(2) (10.90 degrees C) whereas for adult the mean lower temperature threshold was slightly higher (23.22 degrees C) at eCO(2) compared to that of aCO(2) (22.88 degrees C). The thermal requirement of R. maidis from first nymphal instar to adult (total development period) was found to be 100.00 degree days (DD) under eCO(2) conditions as against 111.11degree days under aCO(2) conditions. These estimated temperature thresholds and thermal constant can predict the pest scenarios and population dynamics of R. maidis.

Significant seasonal variation of NO3-N in rivers was separately found in the dormant season (non-growing season) and the growing season. Furtherly, the V-shaped, W-shaped, and indistinct seasonal patterns of NO3-N accounted for 53.0%, 38.7%, and 8.3%, respectively. They were remarkably affected by stream flow, and their significant quadratic function was discovered. The annual maxima and minima of NO3-N corresponded to medium flow in the dormant season and low flow or flood in the growing season, respectively. On one hand, flood mainly played a role in the diluent for the Chao River with high NO3-N, and on the other hand, it acted as a nitrogen source for the Bai River with low NO3-N. The NO3-N was closely correlated with human activities, and this correlation had obvious seasonal change trend. In the dormant season, significant and mostly extremely significant high correlation coefficient (R) values were determined, while partly non-significant with low R values were found in July, August, September, and October. Increasing seasonal variation index of NO3-N from upstream to downstream was found that was gentle for large rivers and sharp for small tributaries. The seasonality of NO3-N was more affected by natural factors, especially flood, than human factors.

How to solve soil water deficit caused by afforestation is an important practical problem. Here, a field experiment of soil water infiltration and replenishment was conducted before and after forestland-to-farmland conversion. Results showed that the cumulative infiltration of each stage (the initial stage, the transitional stage, and the stable stage) was the highest in farmland, followed by forest interspace, and the lowest in forest understory. The non-capillary porosity at 0-20 cm soil layer in farmland was higher than that in forest understory and interspace, which positively improved the infiltration accumulation in the initial stage. Thus, the cumulative infiltration in initial stage of farmland (28.93 mm) was significantly higher than that of forest understory (19.45 mm). Moreover, soil water at the depth of 0-160 cm soil layer was replenished with short term after forestland-tofarmland conversion. It is concluded that forestland-to-farmland conversion could improve soil water infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration by changing porosity, and effectively replenished soil water storage in the short term. These findings have potential implications for effective mitigation of soil water deficit caused by afforestation, and provide a new idea or method for the solution to dry soil layers caused by artificial forestland in semi-arid areas.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				JUL	2022	610								127893	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127893	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127893		MAY 2022											WOS:000804530700001

The taxonomic and functional changes in rare and abundant communities during in bioremediation of cadmium contaminated soils and their contributions to the remediation of ecosystem functions remain elusive despite the significance of rare and abundant microbial taxa in maintaining soil ecological function. Mesorhizobium loti HZ76-inoculated seedlings of the Robinia pseudoacacia were used to create a symbiotic system. The effects of rhizobium inoculation on rare and abundant rhizosphere microbial populations were investigated in pot experiments. Despite having minimal effects on the & alpha;-diversity of rare and abundant microbial communities, inoculation altered microbial community composition and functional gene abundance. For example, abundant phyla such as Proteobacteria were enriched following inoculation, whereas rare phyla such as Ascomycota were depleted. After inoculation, the abundance of nifH gene increased, while the abundance of amoA, amoB, nirS, nirK and nosZ gene decreased. Rare bacterial populations were more susceptible to the inoculated rhizobium's environmental alterations. In rare communities compared to abundance communities, the & alpha;-diversity was higher. Stochastic processes predominated in the communities of uncommon and abundant microorganisms. Furthermore, keystone taxa, particularly rare bacterial taxa (Gemmatimonadaceae and Saprospiraceae) and rare fungal taxa (Ascomycota), more mediates nitrogen cycle processes and is directly associated to the abundance of nitrogen functional genes. Together, our findings demonstrate the different ways that rare and abundant microbial species react to rhizobia inoculation and their connections to the nitrogen cycle.

J	Zhang, YJ; Niu, HS; Yu, Q				Zhang, Yajie; Niu, Haishan; Yu, Qiang			Impacts of climate change and increasing carbon dioxide levels on yield changes of major crops in suitable planting areas in China by the 2050s	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Maize, rice, and wheat are the major staple food crops in China and are crucial components of national food security and economic development. The cultivation and production of these crops are expected to be affected by climate change and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, and have drawn considerable public attention. The objective of this experiment was to understand the impact of future climate change (including increased temperature and changed precipitation patterns) and elevated CO2 concentration on variations of crop yields in their suitable planting areas. We conducted a spatial grid-based analysis of maize, rice, and wheat yields using projections of future climate generated by a multi-model ensemble of global climate models for three representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) in suitable planting areas in China for the 2030s (2021-2040) and the 2050s (2041-2060). Suitable areas for the planting of maize, rice, and wheat under the high-emission scenarios migrated slightly northward over time. Yield of all three crops would be expected to remain stable or to slightly increase across China in the future. A possible reason for this result may be because the positive effects of increased precipitation and CO2 offset the negative effect of increased temperature on crop yields, resulting in a much more appropriate growth environment and increased biomass accumulation and crop yield. In addition, this study also indicated that changes in crop yields were mainly driven by temperature and CO2 factors. The potential effects of climate change and elevated CO2 concentration on migration of planting areas and yield fluctuations for crops should be given greater attention in the future.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate genotypes with high yield and stability in summer maize hybrids grown in the Huanghuaihai region of China using additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) analysis and best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) technique. A total of 18 summer maize hybrids with one check hybrid were used for this study using a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replicates at 74 locations during two consecutive years (2018-2019). A three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and an AMMI analysis showed that genotype (G), environment (E), year (Y) and their interactions were highly significant (p < 0.001) except G x E x Y for all evaluated traits viz., grain yield (GY), ear length (EL), hundred seed weight (HSW) and E x Y for hundred seed weight. The first seven interaction principal components (IPCs) were highly significant and explained 81.74% of the genotype by environment interaction (GEI). By comparing different models, the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) was considered the best model for data analysis in this study. The combination of AMMI model and BLUP technology to use the WAASB (weighted average of absolute scores from the singular value decomposition of the matrix of BLUP for GEI effects generated by linear mixed model) index was considered promising for similar research in the future. Genotypes H321 and Y23 had high yield and good stability, and could be used as new potential genetic resources for improving and stabilizing grain yield in maize breeding practices in the Huanghuaihai region of China. Genotypes H9, H168, Q218, Y303 and L5 had narrow adaptability and only apply to specific areas. The check genotype Z958 had good adaptability in most environments due to its good stability, but it also needs the potential to increase grain yield. Significant positive correlations were also found between the tested agronomic traits.						, Yue/0000-0003-2555-5101														2077-0472				MAY	2022	12	5							602	10.3390/agriculture12050602	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12050602													WOS:000802578300001

GENOTYPES UNDER DIFFERENT IRRIGATION REGIMES	GENETIKA-BELGRADE												Drought stress is one of the most important limiting factors for the production of crop plants in the arid and semi-arid regions of the world. Water deficiency during different developmental stages can change the values of yield components. The yield stability of wheat cultivars at different irrigation regimes is one of the important goals of breeders and agronomists. To determine which cultivar can be categorized as high yielding and stable at different irrigation regime, 10 bread wheat cultivars (C1-C10) were evaluated for grain yield under five levels of irrigation in two years. The significant genotype by environment (GE) interaction for yield confirms the differential response of cultivars to drought stress in different stages of plant development. Additive main effect and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) analysis were used to understand the GE interaction pattern. Based on AMMI parameters, genotypes C3, C6, and C7 exhibit the most stability in different moisture conditions. All three cultivars have been improved for rainfed conditions. Based on AMMI2 mega-environment analysis, Irrigation regimes were categorized into three groups. The first group contained E1 (rainfed) and E2 (interruption of irrigation at the tillering stage), the second group contained environments E3 (at booting stage) and E4 (after anthesis), and the tertiary group contained E5 (optimal irrigation). The results shown that AMMI stability statistics would be useful when static concept of stability is emphasized. But if the time of occurrence of drought stress in a given region is constant, then AMMI mega-environment analysis will be more appropriate.																			0534-0012	1820-6069					2020	52	2					453	464		10.2298/GENSR2002453E	http://dx.doi.org/10.2298/GENSR2002453E													WOS:000577916600004

Longitudinal assessment of the impact of aging on wastage, productivity and welfare of ewes	AUSTRALIAN VETERINARY JOURNAL												Retention of aging ewes is a strategy producers may use to maintain or increase flock size. Older ewes can have a higher risk of mortality and health issues, but these may be minimised with early intervention and culling. This retrospective study examined the incidence and causes of mortality and culling in a flock of Merino ewes as they aged from 4.5 to 5.5 until 9.5 to 10.5 years. The annual rate of ewe mortality ranged from 6.2% to 9.9%, with lambing complications being the major source of reported loss. Annual culling rates ranged from 1.6% to 42.8%, the larger rates reflecting opportunistic replacement with younger ewes rather than essential culling to maintain welfare and productivity. The major reasons for culling were low condition score, worn or missing teeth or faulty udders. The incidence of other faults was low. Only 18.3% of ewes remained when aged 9.5-10.5 years and these were fertile (89% pregnant) with a high proportion of multiple fetuses (52%) in their final year, although fleece weight had declined. Younger ewes born in 2004/2005 tended to have lower annual mortality rates than the aged ewes, but 8%-12% were still culled annually. It is concluded that an annual inspection pre-joining of all ewes and preventative culling for health issues is necessary to minimise any increase in mortality and risk to ewe welfare from retaining aging ewes. More frequent inspection will be required as potential health issues develop during the year, as these may not be evident pre-joining.					; Friend, Michael/P-1454-2018	Robertson, Susan/0000-0001-5129-2216; Friend, Michael/0000-0001-7750-0570													0005-0423	1751-0813				JUN	2023	101	6					248	253		10.1111/avj.13240	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/avj.13240		MAR 2023						36965134					WOS:000956227300001

FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												In the context of climate change, heat stress during the reproductive stages of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) leads to significant yield losses. In order to identify the genomic regions responsible for heat stress tolerance, a recombinant inbred line population derived from DCP 92-3 (heat sensitive) and ICCV 92944 (heat tolerant) was genotyped using the genotyping-by-sequencing approach and evaluated for two consecutive years (2017 and 2018) under normal and late sown or heat stress environments. A high-density genetic map comprising 788 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers spanning 1,125 cM was constructed. Using composite interval mapping, a total of 77 QTLs (37 major and 40 minor) were identified for 12 of 13 traits. A genomic region on CaLG07 harbors quantitative trait loci (QTLs) explaining >30% phenotypic variation for days to pod initiation, 100 seed weight, and for nitrogen balance index explaining >10% PVE. In addition, we also reported for the first time major QTLs for proxy traits (physiological traits such as chlorophyll content, nitrogen balance index, normalized difference vegetative index, and cell membrane stability). Furthermore, 32 candidate genes in the QTL regions that encode the heat shock protein genes, heat shock transcription factors, are involved in flowering time regulation as well as pollen-specific genes. The major QTLs reported in this study, after validation, may be useful in molecular breeding for developing heat-tolerant superior lines or varieties.

(Polygonaceae) in Desert Areas of Central Asia	FORESTS												Understanding the climatically suitable habitat of species plays a vital role in the sustainable use and management of target species. Calligonum mongolicum Turcz., a native shrub species found in desert areas of Central Asia, is generally considered as one of the top four tree species for desertification control. However, previous works on suitable habitat simulation had focused mainly on either the national or specific geographical scales rather than entire biota scales, which have underestimated the climatic tolerance of the species. Furthermore, the uncertainty outcomes of climate change were largely ignored. With these questions, the arid regions of Central Asia were selected as our research background area. Occurrence data of C. mongolicum were obtained from various sources, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, the Chinese Virtual Herbarium, and the iPlant website. The maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) was used to simulate the suitable habitat change dynamics under various climate change scenarios [5 general circulation models (GCMs) x 3 shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs)]. The uncertainty of climate change induced by GCMs and SSPs were decomposed by the two-way ANOVA method. Our results show that hydrological-related variables are more important for the species' habitat suitability than thermal-related variables. The climatic threshold for the core suitable habitat was 1-30 mm for precipitation of the coldest quarter, 14-401 mm for annual precipitation, -16.01-12.42 degrees C for mean temperature of the driest quarter, 9.48-32.63 degrees C for mean temperature of the wettest quarter, and -25.01-- 9.77 degrees C for the minimum temperature of the coldest month. The size of suitable habitat was about 287.4 +/- 10(4) km(2) under the current climate condition, located in China and Mongolia. Climate change has less impact on the total area size, but it has bigger impacts on the gain area and loss area sizes. The loss area is mainly located in the southeast boundaries, whereas the gain area is mainly located in Mongolia and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The decomposition uncertainty of climate change indicates that GCMs could explain 14.5%, 66.4%, and 97.0% of total variation, respectively, and SSPs could explain 85.5%, 33.6%, and 3.0% of the total variation for gain, loss, and total habitat sizes, respectively. Our work clearly demonstrates that while C. mongolicum has great planting potential in Central Asia under various climate change scenarios, the sensitive areas possess large uncertainties requiring long-term climate monitoring for afforestation projects.
