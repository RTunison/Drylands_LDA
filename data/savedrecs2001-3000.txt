Crop and livestock productivity, soil health improvement and insect dynamics: Impact of different fodder-based cropping systems in a rainfed region of India	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												CONTEXT: Farmers in rainfed areas of South Asia depend on livestock to augment income, and provide manure for soil and crops. However, the full potential of the livestock is not realized due to the non-availability of quality fodder. The deficit may be attributed to limitation in expansion of cultivable land as well as non-availability of fodder from the protected forest areas. It is possible to enhance the productivity of the livestock by crop-livestock systems. OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to determine the crop and fodder production potential, nutritive value of the fodder, and reductions in soil nutrients loss and pests of the seven fodder-based inter-cropping systems in a rainfed region in South India.METHODS: A medium-term field experiment was conducted from 2015 to 2021 at the Gungal Research Farm of ICAR's Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (17o05' N, 78o39'E) with seven fodder-based cropping systems involving conventional crops either alone or in combinations with annual or perennial fodder species. The seven systems (treatments) were: sorghum + pigeon pea -hedge lucerne, sorghum + pigeonpea -guinea grass, castor -hedge lucerne, castor -guinea grass, sorghum -fodder -clusterbean -fodder-cowpea -fodder-horsegram, sole sorghum, and sole pigeonpea. Impacts of these systems on crop and livestock productivity, reductions in surface soil erosion and nutrient loss, and soil health and pest dynamics were studied. Livestock based studies were also conducted with the harvested fodders.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found that sorghum + pigeonpea-hedge lucerne on average can produce 3865 kg ha-1 of sorghum grain equivalent yield and 37,820 kg ha-1 of sorghum fodder equivalent yield. The sorghum + pigeon pea-guinea grass would benefit the farmers with no animals, by selling the high biomass grass fodder and minimizing the risk of crop failure. These two systems are also better in providing green fodder for at least 8-9 months without any supplementary irrigation. We also observed increase in soil N, OC and soil mi-crobes. There was reduction in runoff (by 51-52%) and sediment loss (by 52%), and reduced pest and disease incidence in these systems.SIGNIFICANCE: Our study demonstrated that perennial fodder-based cropping systems are an excellent option to enhance the sustainability and livelihood security of rainfed farmers by reducing the risk of crop failure and supporting the livestock. These systems also open up the scope of integrating tree fodders especially in the bunds and farm borders.

Therefore, we studied the impacts of grasslandification on soil carbon (C):nitrogen (N):phosphorus (P) stoichiometry, soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, and release in wetland-grassland transitional zone in Mu Us Desert. Materials and methods From wetland to grassland, the transition zone was divided into five different successional stages according to plant communities and soil water conditions. At every stage, soil physical and chemical properties were determined and C:N:P ratios were calculated. SOC stock and soil respirations were also determined to assess soil carbon storage and release. Results and discussion After grasslandification, SOC contents of top soils (0-10 cm) decreased from 100.2 to 31.79 g kg(-1) in June and from 103.7 to 32.5 g kg(-1) in October; total nitrogen (TN) contents of top soils (0-10 cm) decreased from 3.65 to 1.85 g kg(-1) in June and from 6.43 to 3.36 g kg(-1) in October; and total phosphorus (TP) contents of top soils (0-10 cm) decreased from 179.4 to 117.4 mg kg(-1) in June and from 368.6 to 227.8 mg kg(-1) in October. From stages Typha angustifolia wetland (TAW) to Phalaris arundinacea L. (PAL), in the top soil (0-10 cm), C:N ratios decreased from 32.2 to 16.9 in June and from 19.0 to 11.8 in October; C:P ratios decreased from 1519.2 to 580.5 in June and from 19.0 to 11.8 in October; and N:P ratios decreased from 46.9 to 34.8 in June and changed from 34.9 to 34.0 in October. SOC stock decreased and soil respiration increased with grasslandification. The decrease of SOC, TN, and TP contents was attributed to the reduction of aboveground biomass and mineralization of SOM, and the decrease of soil C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios was mainly attributed to the faster decreasing speeds of SOC than TN and TP. The reduction of aboveground biomass and increased SOC release led by enhanced soil respiration were the main reasons of SOC stock decrease. Conclusions Grasslandification led to lowers levels of SOC, TN, TP, and soil C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios. Grasslandification also led to higher SOC loss, and increased soil respiration was the main reason. Since it is difficult to restore grassland to original wetland, efficient practices should be conducted to reduce water drainage from wetland to prevent grasslandification.						shen, weibo/0000-0001-9762-3105													1439-0108	1614-7480				DEC	2019	19	12					3954	3968		10.1007/s11368-019-02351-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-019-02351-1													WOS:000505160200008

This study aims at investigating the long-term effects of different mulching methods on the crop root growth and soil aggregates stability.MethodsA continuous experiment for eight years was set to assess the effects on the soil aggregates stability, root traits, and yield under five different treatments: (i) control method comprising flat planting without mulching (CK), (ii) flat planting with half film mulching (P), (iii) film mulching on ridges and planting in narrow furrows (S), (iv) full film mulching on double ridges (D), and (v) film mulching on ridges and planting in wide furrows (R).ResultsThe soil quality improved significantly after continuous film mulching for eight years. Compared with CK, mulching decreased the soil bulk density, and increased the soil porosity, soil macroaggregate content (7.39%-22.92% by dry-sieving, and 8.49%-21.67% by wet-sieving), and soil aggregate stability, especially under S and D. Mulching could promote the root growth (root length, root diameter, root surface area, and root volume) distinctly, while S and D increased the average root biomass by 17.27% compared with R and P. The improved soil structure and root traits under mulching increased the yield (29.98-63.96%), and the average yield under S was 1.32%, 25.7%, and 26.14% higher than those under D, R, and P, respectively.ConclusionsIn general, the best improved soil aggregate fractions and stability was found under film mulching on ridges and planting in narrow furrows (S), which was significantly associated with the root traits improvement, and thus increasing the crop yield. Therefore, it can be considered an effective mulching pattern for increasing and stabilizing the crop yield in the Loess Plateau region of China.

The water balance model made use of various in-situ and satellite-derived data.New hydrological insights: The analysis of the water losses from the pool showed that most of the water was lost through evaporation. The interaction between the pool and groundwater is dependent on the water levels, as the pool loses water to the subsurface up to a certain depth then it starts gaining. When the Wolverfontein 2 pool is full, it can retained water for approximately 258 days without having a surface water inflow. A water balance model was established, and it simulated the water levels with a high correlation of 0.9. This model was also evaluated in the neighbouring pools, and while it simulated the water levels of the upstream pool well, this was not the case for the downstream pool. When remote sensing-derived rainfall and evaporation data were used in the model, the simulated water levels had a slightly lower correlation of 0.7 with the observed water levels. Overall, the remotely sensing-based monthly fluxes estimates could not provide the detailed pool information that was required for the water balance. Errors may have arisen, or they may have been inherited, from any of the three remotely-sensed parameters, namely, the surface area, the rainfall or the evaporation. Although remote sensing did not provide detailed information, it is worth noting that it provides baseline information on the pool dy-namics. Overall, this work underscores the relevance of multisource data and the water balance, it helps to better understand the pool dynamics and it will help with the better management of NPRs.

However, our knowledge of microbial distribution patterns and ecological drivers is still poor, especially so for the Chihuahuan Desert. MethodsThis project investigated the effects of trampling disturbance on surface soil microbiomes, explored community composition and structure, and related patterns to abiotic and biotic landscape characteristics within the Chihuahuan Desert biome. Composite soil samples were collected in disturbed and undisturbed areas of 15 long-term ecological research plots in the Jornada Basin, New Mexico. Microbial diversity of cross-domain microbial groups (total Bacteria, Cyanobacteria, Archaea, and Fungi) was obtained via DNA amplicon metabarcode sequencing. Sequence data were related to landscape characteristics including vegetation type, landforms, ecological site and state as well as soil properties including gravel content, soil texture, pH, and electrical conductivity. ResultsFilamentous Cyanobacteria dominated the photoautotrophic community while Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria dominated among the heterotrophic bacteria. Thaumarchaeota were the most abundant Archaea and drought adapted taxa in Dothideomycetes and Agaricomycetes were most abundant fungi in the soil surface microbiomes. Apart from richness within Archaea (p = 0.0124), disturbed samples did not differ from undisturbed samples with respect to alpha diversity and community composition (p & GE; 0.05), possibly due to a lack of frequent or impactful disturbance. Vegetation type and landform showed differences in richness of Bacteria, Archaea, and Cyanobacteria but not in Fungi. Richness lacked strong relationships with soil variables. Landscape features including parent material, vegetation type, landform type, and ecological sites and states, exhibited stronger influence on relative abundances and microbial community composition than on alpha diversity, especially for Cyanobacteria and Fungi. Soil texture, moisture, pH, electrical conductivity, lichen cover, and perennial plant biomass correlated strongly with microbial community gradients detected in NMDS ordinations. DiscussionOur study provides first comprehensive insights into the relationships between landscape characteristics, associated soil properties, and cross-domain soil microbiomes in the Chihuahuan Desert. Our findings will inform land management and restoration efforts and aid in the understanding of processes such as desertification and state transitioning, which represent urgent ecological and economical challenges in drylands around the world.

To examine the spring movement strategy of Mongolian gazelles (Procapra gutturosa) in Mongolia, where predictability of vegetation conditions is relatively low, we identified the type of each movement, evaluated the preferred vegetation conditions for gazelles, and quantified the benefit achieved through each spring movement. The surveyed gazelles continuously preferred areas with intermediate normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values from May to July, and spatial and temporal shifts of the distribution of preferred areas explain the long-distance movements of many gazelles in spring. Three movement types, sedentary, linear, and nomadic movement, were identified. The period when benefit varied most greatly among individuals differed between the linear and nomadic movement types. During the spring movement period, the variance of benefit was larger for the nomadic movement type, whereas during the summer it was larger for the linear movement type, suggesting the existence of different movement strategies in the Mongolian gazelle. Linear long-distance movements over a short period in the linear movement type suggest the so-called jumper strategy, whereas other movement patterns might represent the searcher strategy. Benefit loss through movements of individuals in both strategies indicate low interannual predictability of vegetation conditions in the study area, and it would explain the co-existence of multiple movement types or strategies used by Mongolian gazelles in spring.

Large-scale screening complements genomic efforts to identify genes relevant for crop improvement. Thirty maize inbred lines from various sources (exotic and indigenous) maintained at Dryland Agriculture Research Station were used in the current study. In the automated plant transport and imaging systems (LemnaTec Scanalyzer system for large plants), top and side view images were taken of the VIS (visible) and NIR (near infrared) range of the light spectrum to capture phenes. All images were obtained with a thermal imager. All sensors were used to collect images one day after shifting the pots from the greenhouse for 11 days. Image processing was done using pre-processing, segmentation and flowered by features' extraction. Different surrogate traits such as pixel area, plant aspect ratio, convex hull ratio and calliper length were estimated. A strong association was found between canopy temperature and above ground biomass under stress conditions. Promising lines in different surrogates will be utilized in breeding programmes to develop mapping populations for traits of interest related to drought resilience, in terms of improved tissue water status and mapping of genes/QTLs for drought traits.

Spores of coprophilous fungi are nowadays frequently employed as grazing indicators in palaeoecological sequences, but their use in dryland pastoral deposits is not routine in geoarchaeological practice. The paper assesses the relationship between the occurrence of spherulites and dung fungal spores from an abandoned rock shelter used as a stable for several decades. A clear match between these proxies is shown, and their distribution across the sediments is discussed, highlighting the potential of coprophilous spore analysis from archaeological stabling deposits, alongside other established dung indicators. The abundance of other microfossils (parasite eggs, coccolith plates and freshwater indicators) is also quantified and discussed.

Effects of experimental nitrogen deposition on soil organic carbon storage in Southern California drylands	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is enriching soils with N across biomes. Soil N enrichment can increase plant productivity and affect microbial activity, thereby increasing soil organic carbon (SOC), but such responses vary across biomes. Drylands cover similar to 45% of Earth's land area and store similar to 33% of global SOC contained in the top 1 m of soil. Nitrogen fertilization could, therefore, disproportionately impact carbon (C) cycling, yet whether dryland SOC storage increases with N remains unclear. To understand how N enrichment may change SOC storage, we separated SOC into plant-derived, particulate organic C (POC), and largely microbially derived, mineral-associated organic C (MAOC) at four N deposition experimental sites in Southern California. Theory suggests that N enrichment increases the efficiency by which microbes build MAOC (C stabilization efficiency) if soil pH stays constant. But if soils acidify, a common response to N enrichment, then microbial biomass and enzymatic organic matter decay may decrease, increasing POC but not MAOC. We found that N enrichment had no effect on C fractions except for a decrease in MAOC at one site. Specifically, despite reported increases in plant biomass in three sites and decreases in microbial biomass and extracellular enzyme activities in two sites that acidified, POC did not increase. Furthermore, microbial C use and stabilization efficiency increased in a non-acidified site, but without increasing MAOC. Instead, MAOC decreased by 16% at one of the sites that acidified, likely because it lost 47% of the exchangeable calcium (Ca) relative to controls. Indeed, MAOC was strongly and positively affected by Ca, which directly and, through its positive effect on microbial biomass, explained 58% of variation in MAOC. Long-term effects of N fertilization on dryland SOC storage appear abiotic in nature, such that drylands where Ca-stabilization of SOC is prevalent and soils acidify, are most at risk for significant C loss.

Integration of RUSLE Model, Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques for Assessing Soil Erosion Hazards in Arid Zones	AGRICULTURE-BASEL												Soil erosion constitutes one of the main environmental and food security threats, derived from the loss of its productive capacity. With the help of remote sensing (RS), geographic information systems (GIS), and a revised version of the universal soil loss equation (RUSLE), this research has mostly focused on measuring the potential soil erosion hazard and soil water conservation ratio (SWCR) in the El-Minia region of Egypt. Based on the integration of S2A images and the digital elevation model (DEM), geomorphological units of the study area were identified. The RUSLE model includes parameters that allow for mapping soil erosion, such as rain erosivity, soil erodibility, slope length and steepness, soil cover and management, and soil conservation practices. The outcomes revealed that the classes of annual erosion rates of the study area are those of "slight erosion", "low erosion", "moderate erosion" and "moderately high erosion", which represent percentages of 29%, 18%, 33% and 20%, respectively, of the total area. The rate of erosion decreases from east to west. The main erosion factors in the research area are the low vegetation cover and the high slope values. This study highlights the utility of combining the classic RUSLE equation with techniques such as remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) as a basis for assessing current erosion conditions in arid environments and, specifically, for the application of soil management patterns aimed at increasing soil organic matter and any other soil conservation actions. The findings of this study can be used by policymakers to implement soil conservation measures if development projects are to proceed in areas with a high risk of soil erosion. The approach described here is therefore adaptable to similar environments in arid regions.

To determine the CCV across drylands in northern China, we developed a technical framework based on two measures of leaf area index (LAI): maximum LAI (Max-LAI) and safe LAI (Safe-LAI), and their thresholds, CCVmax and CCVsafe, for six drylands (Horqin, Hulun Buir, Otindag, Mu Us, Tengger, and Junggar) using remote sensing datasets from 2000 to 2014. We also predicted dynamics of CCV of the drylands over the next decade (2015-2024) by establishing optimal prediction models based on environmental factors (temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and elevation). According to these models, the Max-LAI threshold (range: 0.36-1.03 m(2)/m(2)) and Safe-LAI threshold (0.29-0.70 m(2)/m(2)) declined from east to west with decreases in aridity index. Under current climatic variability and anthropogenic disturbances, the CCV in most drylands would have positive increments (approximately 15%), except in the Horqin (approximately -15%) and Tengger (slight changes), during the following decade. This indicates that there is scope for improving vegetation coverage in most drylands, except in the Horqin and Tengger. Our results suggest that revegetation and ecosystem management to prevent ongoing desertification should be carried out at the regional scale. Although it does not account for biocrusts, artificially introduced vegetation, underground water, and other vegetation attributes (e.g., density and biomass), our technical framework and results might nonetheless be valuable in evaluating regional ecological security and guiding vegetation restoration of drylands across northern China.

This study investigated the impact of changes in rainfall, land use/land cover (LULC), and land use management (LUM) practices on gully erosion in two midland watersheds (treated Kecha and untreated Laguna) in the Upper Blue Nile basin of Ethiopia by using the LANDPLANER model in combination with intensive field measurements and remote sensing products. We simulated gully erosion under past (in 2005), present (in 2021), and three potential future curve number conditions, each time under four rainfall scenarios (10, 30, 60, and 100 mm) using the dynamic erosion index (e), static topographic (esp), and erosion channel (esp_channel) thresholds. Density plot analyses showed that gullies frequently occur in low-lying gentle slope areas with relatively higher curve number values. The best predictions of gullies identified through true positive rates (TPR) and true negative rates (TNR) were achieved considering the static esp_channel > 1 for Kecha (TPR = 0.667 and TNR = 0.544) and the dynamic e > 0.1 for 60 mm of rainfall in Laguna (TPR = 0.769 and TNR = 0.516). Despite the 10 mm rainfall having negligible erosion-triggering potential in both watersheds, the 60 and 100 mm rainfall scenarios were 4-5 and 10-17 times, respectively, higher than the 30 mm rainfall scenario. While the LULC change in the untreated Laguna watershed increased the impact of rainfall on gully initiation by only 0-2% between 2005 and 2021, the combination of LULC and LUM significantly reduced the impact of rainfall in the treated Kecha watershed by 64-79%. Similarly, the gully initiation area in Kecha was reduced by 28% (from 33% in 2005 to 5% in 2021) due to changes in LULC and LUM practices, whereas Laguna showed little increment by only 1% (from 42% in 2005 to 43% in 2021) due to LULC change. In addition, the future predicted alternative land use planning options showed that gully initiation areas in Laguna could be reduced by 1% with only LULC conversion; 39% when only LUM practices were implemented; and 37% when both were combined. These results indicate that LUM practices outweigh the impact of LULC on gully erosion in the studied paired watersheds. Overall, LANDPLANER successfully simulated the spatio-temporal variation of gully erosion with scenario-based analyses and hence can be used to predict gullies in the study area and other data-scarce regions with similar agro-ecological settings.

RESPONSE OF KERNEL STRUCTURE-RELATED TRAITS TO PLANTING DENSITY AND CULTIVAR IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WAXY CORN EAR	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Kernel structure-related traits are important factors that affect the yield and ear appearance of waxy corn (Zea mays L. var. ceratina), regulated together by genetic factors and cultivation practices. Two planting densities, 52500 plants/ha and 67500 plants/ha, were established in this study for three major cultivars that are promoted in the local region: Jinnuo 18# (JN18), Jinnuo 20# (JN20), and Jindannuo 41# (JdN41). We measured how the kernel length, width, thickness, volume, 100-kernel weight, and kernel weight of different parts of the waxy corn ear changed with planting density and cultivar. The results showed that planting density did not significantly affect the structure-related traits of kernels in different parts of the waxy corn ear. Most of the kernel structure-related traits in the middle and basal parts were significantly higher than those in the apical part of the waxy corn ear. Compared with planting density, cultivar had a greater influence on kernel structure-related traits in waxy corn. Comparison between different cultivars showed that the kernel structure-related traits in JN18 were better than those in JdN41.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2022	20	5					4095	4108		10.15666/aeer/2005_40954108	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/2005_40954108		JUL 2022											WOS:000850207900001

The tetraploid species, Sorghum halepense, is assumed an allopolyploid species formed by hybridization between diploid S. bicolor and S. propinquum. The repeat profiles of S. bicolor, S. halepense, and their relatives were compared to elucidate the repeats' role in shaping their genomes. The repeat frequencies and profiles of the three diploid accessions (S. bicolor, S. bicolor ssp. verticilliflorum, and S. bicolor var. technicum) and two tetraploid accessions (S. halepense) are similar. However, the polymorphic distribution of the subtelomeric satellites preferentially enriched in the tetraploid S. halepense indicates drastic genome rearrangements after the allopolyploidization event. Verified by CENH3 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis the centromeres of S. bicolor are mainly composed of the abundant satellite SorSat137 (CEN38) and diverse CRMs, Athila of Ty3_gypsy and Ty1_copia-SIRE long terminal repeat (LTR) retroelements. A similar centromere composition was found in S. halepense. The potential contribution of S. bicolor in the formation of tetraploid S. halepense is discussed.

Yet its impacts on ecosystem services remain uncertain because pervasive interactions between grazing pressure, climate, soil properties, and biodiversity may occur but have never been addressed simultaneously. Using a standardized survey at 98 sites across six continents, we show that interactions between grazing pressure, climate, soil, and biodiversity are critical to explain the delivery of fundamental ecosystem services across drylands worldwide. Increasing grazing pressure reduced ecosystem service delivery in warmer and speciespoor drylands, whereas positive effects of grazing were observed in colder and species-rich areas. Considering interactions between grazing and local abiotic and biotic factors is key for understanding the fate of dryland ecosystems under climate change and increasing human pressure.

However, losses can result in negative environmental impacts as well as having a significant impact on farmer profitability. Such losses can vary significantly, therefore it is important to benchmark nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) across a range of environments to better understand opportunities for improvement. Using a combination of 15N mass balance and monitoring for gaseous N2O flux we undertook an assessment of NUE at 29 sites spread across a range of management systems in semi-arid and temperate environments of south eastern Australia. An N rate experiment was established at each site, testing three different in-season application rates with N surface applied as urea. Timing and rates were determined in relation to farmer practice for the broader paddock. Loss of fertiliser N averaged 29% (ranging from 5 to 54%) and while daily N2O flux rates represented a fraction of this, peak flux rates ranged from 52 to 132 to 376 g N2O-N/ha/day across low/ medium rainfall, high rainfall and irrigated regions respectively. Crop recovery of applied N ranged from 3 to 65% and was positively correlated with agronomic efficiency of N application.

Among them are a cluster of several trees located in Wadi Zetan, at the heart of the Shivta horticulture terroir, with its abundant agricultural runoff remains. Two isolated olive bearing trees stand in a sheltered beneath cliff in the upper part of the wadi. Radiocarbon dating of an internal part of the trunk of one of these living trees estimates its minimum age as the mid-16th - early 17th century CE (~500 years old). Archaeological excavations conducted beneath the trees and the adjacent dam revealed OSL samples of loess accumulation dated to the Early Islamic period (8th-9th centuries CE). The stratigraphy and chronology of this sediment deposition indicate its rapid and short accumulation. Palynological analysis of the same OSL dated samples indicates that grapevines and olive trees were cultivated in the immediate vicinity of the site during the Early Islamic period. The lack of pollen of cultivated taxa from the latter part of the sequence points to cessation of the agricultural activity, probably a few hundred years later. Leaf samples for DNA profiling of the trees in comparison to other local old olive trees around the country, indicate that the trees in Wadi Zetan are genetically close to a known cultivar common among ancient olive trees. The trees have survived for at least a few hundred years, in an arid area, due to the local conditions and enhanced drainage from the man-made upper runoff system. These old olive trees bear a powerful and symbolic significance, indicating the endurance and sustain ability of ancient desert runoff agriculture. Moreover, the survival of their relicts in Wadi Zetan suggests their potential as cultivars greater resilience to the harsh growing conditions of arid environments.

Experimental Warming Changes Phenology and Shortens Growing Season of the Dominant Invasive Plant <i>Bromus tectorum</i> (Cheatgrass)	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) has successfully invaded and established throughout the western United States. Bromus tectorum grows early in the season and this early growth allows B. tectorum to outcompete native species, which has led to dramatic shifts in ecosystem function and plant community composition after B. tectorum invades. If the phenology of native species is unable to track changing climate as effectively as B. tectorum's phenology then climate change may facilitate further invasion. To better understand how B. tectorum phenology will respond to future climate, we tracked the timing of B. tectorum germination, flowering, and senescence over a decade in three in situ climate manipulation experiments with treatments that increased temperatures (2 degrees C and 4 degrees C above ambient), altered precipitation regimes, or applied a combination of each. Linear mixed-effects models were used to analyze treatment effects on the timing of germination, flowering, senescence, and on the length of the vegetative growing season (time from germination to flowering) in each experiment. Altered precipitation treatments were only applied in early years of the study and neither precipitation treatments nor the treatments' legacies significantly affected B. tectorum phenology. The timing of germination did not significantly vary between any warming treatments and their respective ambient plots. However, plots that were warmed had advances in the timing of B. tectorum flowering and senescence, as well as shorter vegetative growing seasons. The phenological advances caused by warming increased with increasing degrees of experimental warming. The greatest differences between warmed and ambient plots were seen in the length of the vegetative growing season, which was shortened by approximately 12 and 7 days in the +4 degrees C and +2 degrees C warming levels, respectively. The effects of experimental warming were small compared to the effects of interannual climate variation, suggesting that interactive controls and the timing of multiple climatic factors are important in determining B. tectorum phenology. Taken together, these results help elucidate how B. tectorum phenology may respond to future climate, increasing our predictive capacity for estimating when to time B. tectorum control efforts and how to more effectively manage this exotic annual grass.

J	Rocha, MDD; Neto, IEL				Delmiro Rocha, Maria de Jesus; Lima Neto, Iran Eduardo			Internal phosphorus loading and its driving factors in the dry period of Brazilian semiarid reservoirs	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												This study investigated the relationships between physical, limnological and climatic drivers with the internal total phosphorus (TP) loading produced over the dry period in 30 water supply reservoirs of the Brazilian semiarid. Improvements in the understanding of sedimentary TP fluxes in reservoirs of dryland regions are pressing as they usually have serious water quality related issues, remaining mostly eutrophic especially under frequent drought events. Gross daily fluxes and net seasonal average release rates were calculated from mass balance and regression equations considering water and sediment TP concentrations, anoxic duration, water temperature and fish contribution. Additionally, the ratio of wind speed to reservoir volume was proposed as a new surrogate and then applied as explanatory variable to predictive models. The results indicated TP release rates higher than reported for non-semiarid lakes/reservoirs with average gross fluxes ranging from 17.64 to 35.99 mg m(-2) day(-1). This may be attributed to the enriched sediments (1029.49 +/- 552.49 mg kg(-1)) allied with warmer water temperature, high trophic state, and prolonged anoxic periods (average duration of about 60 days). The average release rates were negatively correlated with water transparency and water depth, and positively correlated with Chl-a, wind speed and trophic state. The release rates increased across the trophic gradient (p < 0.05), about 10-fold higher under hypertrophic conditions than in oligotrophic ones. As anoxia is linked with eutrophication, phosphorus release is more likely in eutrophic ecosystems. Regarding the new surrogate, a strong predictive ability for TP release (R-2: 0.26-0.93) was observed. Similarly, the proposed models presented a physically consistent behavior with a stabilizing releasing pattern suggesting the achievement of equilibrium in nutrient exchange between sediment-water interface. This research advanced by combining and proposing methods to assess and quantify sedimentary fluxes in data-scarce regions balancing accuracy and transferability, in order to be replicable to other dryland environments globally.

Targeted irrigation expands scope for winter cereal production in water-limited areas of California's San Joaquin Valley	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												CONTEXT: Efforts to achieve groundwater sustainability in California's San Joaquin Valley will entail substantial pumping reductions, and much irrigated cropland may become newly fallowed. Winter crops grown under water -limited conditions could offer an alternative to fallowing, but their viability may be limited by variable rainfall and high crop failure rates.OBJECTIVE: The first objective of this study was to evaluate how small (100-200 mm), targeted irrigation events impact crop establishment, forage and grain yields, and the resulting economic and agronomic water produc-tivity of winter wheat at 4 sites in the San Joaquin Valley. Additionally, we assessed the probability of producing economically viable forage yields across the region based on historical precipitation totals combined with 0, 100, or 200 mm of supplemental irrigation.METHODS: We used APSIM to run 20-yr simulations of winter wheat establishment and productivity under historical weather conditions at four groundwater dependent sites in California's San Joaquin Valley. For each site, we simulated wheat productivity (biomass and grain) under three irrigation scenarios (no irrigation, 100 mm, or 200 mm) and three sowing dates (mid-October, mid-November, and mid-December). We applied model outputs to calculations of economic and agronomic water productivity, and used the modeled relationship be-tween soft dough biomass yield and total water input (precipitation plus irrigation) to determine the likelihood of a successful wheat crop in any given year across the region.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found that two 100 mm applications of irrigation applied at times of critical soil water depletion decreased crop failure rates from 45% of years to 0% of years at the driest site. Economic water productivity was highest when wheat was harvested for forage at the soft dough stage, and agronomic water productivity of soft dough forage was highest with supplemental irrigation and early planting. Given the precipitation requirements to achieve economically viable soft dough-stage forage yields, the addition of 100 mm of irrigation in a single event expanded the potential cropping area to 11% (126,356 ha) of groundwater dependent cropland in the region, while 200 mm of irrigation expanded the potential cropping area to 100% (1,109,888 ha) of cropland.SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that small, targeted supplemental irrigation events could greatly expand the scope for water-limited winter forage production in the San Joaquin Valley. Such an approach could serve as an alternative to land fallowing in areas transitioning away from irrigated summer crops where appropriate technological and policy mechanisms are in place.																			0308-521X	1873-2267				AUG	2023	210								103696	10.1016/j.agsy.2023.103696	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2023.103696		JUN 2023											WOS:001022583400001
J	An, L; Zhong, S; Shen, L				An, Li; Zhong, Shuai; Shen, Lei			Dynamic Effects of Climate and Land Use Policies on Water Yield in Drylands-A Case Study in the Northwest of China	WATER												Water yield as an important ecosystem service for mitigating water scarcity in drylands, is quite sensitive to land use and climate change. Evaluating the response of water yield to land use policies in drylands under climate change is conducive to sustainable water resource management. Taking the Hohhot-Baotou-Ordous-Yulin region in the northwest of China as an example, this study used the methods of the InVEST model, trend analysis, comparative experiment, PLUS model to explore the spatial-temporal trends and driving factors of water yield variation, as well as to simulate the future water yield under different land use policy scenarios. The results showed that (1) water yield in the study area fluctuated and increased from 14.14 mm to 46.59 mm during 2000 to 2020, the places with a significant increasing trend of water yield were mainly distributed in the southeast loess hilly area; (2) climate change is the major driving factor of water yield variation with a contribution rate of 85.8-99.6%, but land use change played an increasingly important role in affecting water yield; (3) the Grain-Security-Dominated (GSD) land use policy scenario would generate the highest water yield in 2030 under climate conditions of SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5, while the Regional-Greening-Dominated (RGD) land use policy scenario has the lowest water yield in the future. The results could provide reference for the decision-making process of ecological restoration and land use planning in drylands.

Ecological restoration projects (ERPs) are considered a traditional approach to mitigate wind erosion by altering the structures and functions of the ecosystem. Thus, the efficiency of China's historical large-scale ERPs for wind erosion mitigation should be examined and optimized to better address this global environmental challenge. We assessed the change in wind erosion using a biophysical model and investigated the associated drivers identified. In addition, the efficiency of ERPs was examined by adopting the theory of nonlinear ecosystem dynamics. The erosion modulus significantly declined from 1990 to 2017, but this declining trend reversed since 2009. The structural equation model and related analyses revealed that the declining wind speed, wetting soil moisture, and vegetation greening substantially reduced wind erosion, while the reversal of declining wind speed around 2009 aggravated wind erosion, particularly in the northern Inner Mongolia Sandstorm Area. The relatively arid climate restricted vegetation restoration and further offset afforestation efforts, resulting in the transition of declining erosion modulus. From the perspective of non-linear ecosystem dynamics, a wet climate provides a crucial window of opportunity for ERP in drylands, while the window of risks due to dry and windy climates may extend the time required for a shift change after ERP and may postpone the stage change toward the LDN goal. Hence, climate-induced windows of opportunity and risks are crucial in identifying the time for initiating ERPs, and existing environmental conditions and critical thresholds should be carefully considered.

With the advances in agronomy and breeding, commercial crops like maize (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max) in the region are under threat from climate change, decreasing rainfall and degraded lands. Unlike commercial crops that are generally adapted from other regions, underutilized indigenous crops are uniquely suited to local environments and are more resilient to climatic variations and tolerant to local pests and diseases. This study, done in Limpopo Province, South Africa, identifies optimal areas for cultivating Bambara groundnuts (Vigna subterannea), an indigenous crop suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. The aim is to promote the production of underutilized indigenous crops at a large scale with fewer resources, while still meeting local demand and reducing the food import budget. Suitability maps are delineated using a multicriteria decision method in a Geographic Information System (GIS). The procedure is important for diversifying farming systems, making them more resilient (to biotic and abiotic stresses and climate change) and more successful at enhancing water, food and nutritional security. With the province's limited water and land resources for agriculture expansion, promoting indigenous underutilized crops is a pathway to reduce water allocated to agriculture, thereby enhancing drought resilience and ensuring water, food and nutritional security. Large tracts of degraded agricultural land deemed unsuitable for adapted crops, and which may require costly land reclamation practices, can be used to cultivate underutilized crops that are adapted to extreme local conditions.

J	Gxokwe, S; Dube, T; Mazvimavi, D; Grenfell, M				Gxokwe, Siyamthanda; Dube, Timothy; Mazvimavi, Dominic; Grenfell, Michael			Using cloud computing techniques to monitor long-term variations in ecohydrological dynamics of small seasonally-flooded wetlands in semi-arid South Africa	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Wetlands in drylands have high inter-and intra-annual ecohydrological variations that are driven to a great extent by climate variability and anthropogenic influences. The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands encourages the development of frameworks for national action and international cooperation for ensuring conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources at local, national and regional scales. However, the implementation of these frameworks remains a challenge. This is mainly due to limited availability of high-resolution data and suitable big data processing techniques for assessing and monitoring wetland ecohydrological dynamics at large spatial scales, particularly in the sub-Saharan African region. The availability of cloud computing platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) offers unique big data handling and processing opportunities to address some of these challenges. In this study, we applied the GEE cloud computing platform to monitor the long-term ecohydrological dynamics of a seasonally flooded part of the Nylsvley floodplain wetland complex in north-eastern South Africa over a 20-year period (2000-2020). The specific objectives of the study were 1) to evaluate wetland ecohydrological dynamics using the 20-year multi-date Landsat composite data coupled with the Random Forest machine learning algorithm, and 2) to establish the major drivers of wetland ecohydrological changes, using selected spectral indices (i.e. Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Normalised Difference Phenology Index (NDPI)) coupled with climate data. The ecohydrology of the wetland changed over time, with some classes increasing twice when compared to the previous measurement, while others decreasing significantly during the study period. Notably, the bare surface class increased at rates of 230% and 350% between 2006-2010 and 2016-2020, respectively. Moreover, the indices showed similar trends throughout the 20-year period, with NDWI having minimum values less than zero in all cases. This implied no surface inundation, although the presence of some wetland vegetation indicated seasonal to semipermanent soil saturation conditions. A comparative analysis of climate data and remotely sensed indices showed that annual changes of precipitation and evapotranspiration were the main drivers of wetland ecohydrological variations. The findings of the study underscore the relevance of cloud computing artificial intelligence techniques, and particularly the GEE platform, in evaluating wetland ecohydrological dynamics for semiarid southern African systems which are deteriorating due to the unsustainable use and poor management resulting from limited knowledge about their changes over time.

New paddy field construction can give full play to the production and ecological functions of paddy field and can adjust the development structure of the agricultural industry effectively. The soil properties of shear strength and permeability, which provide a theoretical basis for engineering design, construction, and post-operation, are important indexes in the site selection of new paddy field. The shear strength and permeability properties of soils from different land use types (vegetable field, gentle slope dryland, corn field, grapery, and abandoned dryland) for engineering new paddy field construction were investigated in this study. The results showed that the soil water content had a significant effect on the soil shear strength, internal friction angle, and cohesion. The total pressure required for soil destruction decreased with increasing water content under the same vertical pressure, resulting in easier destruction of soils. The internal friction angle decreased with increasing soil water content, and the soil cohesion first increased and then decreased with increasing soil water content. Considering that paddy fields were flooded for a long time, the soil strength properties had certain water sensitivity. Effective measures must be taken to reduce the change in soil water content, so as to ensure the stability of the embankment foundation, roadside ditch foundation, and cutting slope. In addition, the influence of changing soil water content on the strength properties of paddy soils should be fully considered in engineering design and construction, and the soil bulk density at the plough pan should reach at least 1.5 g cm(-3) or more to ensure better water retention and the anti-seepage function of paddy field. The study can provide construction technology for engineering new paddy field construction in a hilly mountainous region of southwestern China.

These have potential for biomass production for bioenergy, eucalyptus oil and generating carbon credits and to help control the extensive occurrence of dryland salinity. Some 12,000 ha of mallee planting has been undertaken since 1994, mostly in the form of wide-spaced, narrow belts within the annual agricultural system. Production and market data were used to estimate levelized costs (LC) of mallee biomass production under different harvest regimes across 11 sites from 2006 to 2012. We found LC ranged from AUD40 to AUD257 fresh Mg-1. LC was most strongly determined by mallee production, followed by the crop/pasture rotation decisions of the landholder. Mallee harvest regime had minor impact on LC. Crop and pasture yield loss due to competition from the mallee belts accounted for 38% of costs, harvesting biomass was 32%, opportunity cost of the land occupied by the mallee belts was 16% while establishment and maintenance costs accounted for 14% of the costs. When income from carbon sequestered in mallee root biomass was included, the LC dropped by an average of 11% at the current Australian price of AUD15 Mg-1 CO2 equivalent (CO(2)e). The income from carbon sequestered in root biomass alone is unlikely to make mallee agroforestry economically viable. Hence, income from harvested biomass in the form of feedstocks for industry or carbon credits is necessary to make mallee agroforestry commercially attractive. LC for unharvested mallee belts ranged from AUD33 to AUD237 Mg-1. Where above- and below-ground biomass is converted to CO(2)e at AUD15 Mg-1, the LC drops to AUD11-AUD64, with three of 11 sites likely to be profitable. These three sites were characterized by high biomass production with low agricultural gross margins.

This issue was explored after 33 years of manure (i.e. farmyard manure at agronomic and elevated rates) and chemical fertilizer application in a Calcic Cambisol on the Loess Plateau. The application of manure increased SOC and the mass proportion of macroaggregates by 1.1- to 1.8-fold and 1.5- to 2.3-fold, respectively, compared with the unfertilized control. The aliphaticity, aromaticity and hydrophobicity indices of SOC as characterized by C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were higher in the manure-amended soils than in the chemical fertilizer-treated soils. The application of manure increased the microbial necromass by 1.3- to 2.6-fold compared with the control. Fungal necromass was enriched in the macroaggregates, while bacterial necromass was enriched in the microaggregates. Compared with the control, manure application increased (P < 0.05) the relative contribution of fungal necromass to SOC, which was positively correlated with the chemical recalcitrance of the SOC (i.e. aliphaticity, aromaticity and hydrophobicity) (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the chemical recalcitrance and relative contribution of microbial necromass, particularly that of fungal necromass, in the bulk soil (P < 0.05) and soil aggregates (P < 0.01) were positively correlated with the mass proportion of macroaggregates. Therefore, the accumulation of recalcitrant C components and fungal necromass contributes to soil aggregation in the Calcic Cambisols of the Loess Plateau.																			0178-2762	1432-0789				JAN	2023	59	1					73	85		10.1007/s00374-022-01684-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-022-01684-3		NOV 2022											WOS:000889387600003

We conducted field experiments using RFRHS and traditional flat planting (TFP) at four different fertilizer rates: (i) no fertilizer (CK); (ii) low (L), N 90 + P2O5 60 kg ha(-1); (iii) medium (M), N 180 + P2O5 120 kg ha(-1); and (iv) high (H), N 270 + P2O5 180 kg ha(-1). RFRHS significantly improved the topsoil water content (by 4.7-8.5% in 0-40 cm layer) and topsoil temperature (by 0.4-0.7 degrees C), which stimulated stable seedling establishment and accelerated millet growth. Fertilization significantly enhanced water absorption in 0-140 cm profile, prolonged the growth period of millet and significantly increased dry matter accumulation. Finally, under RFRHS, the grain yield and water use efficiency (WUE) of foxtail millet increased by 6.2% and 6.7%, respectively, compared with TFP, and they tended to increase more as fertilizer rate increases, indicating a positive interaction between water and nutrients. However, under RFRHS, the M fertilizer rate obtained a higher yield (average 6748.6 kg ha(-1)), WUE (average 18.6 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)) compared with CK and L rates, and made a greater contribution to the grain yield (average 32.1%), but no further significant increases were observed with the H fertilizer rate where RFRFS showed a tendency to decrease grain yield compared to TFP in wet years. Therefore, RFRHS with fertilizer application at a rate of N 180 + P2O5 120 kg ha(-1) may be suitable for high-efficiency farming management to improve the yield and WUE for foxtail millet in this semiarid region.					zhang, xu/GRX-9733-2022; zhang, xiaofei/HJA-9117-2022; zhang, xiaoyu/HJI-4374-2023; zhang, xu/GYE-3558-2022; Zhang, xiaoyu/HTM-3222-2023; zhang, xian/GYA-0290-2022; Zhang, xiaoyu/GXA-3206-2022														0378-3774	1873-2283				JAN 20	2020	227								105852	10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105852	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105852													WOS:000525275500015

Productivity and profitability of alternative steer growth paths resulting from accessing high-quality forage systems in the subtropics of northern Australia: a modelling approach	ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE												Beef producers have to determine the best allocation of a limited resource of high-quality forage. This analysis assessed the most profitable way of incorporating high-quality forages into the whole-of-life steer growth path on forage systems in central Queensland, using property-level, regionally relevant herd models that determine whole-of-business productivity and profitability over a 30-year investment period. Twenty-two growth paths (liveweight change over time) from weaning to marketing were investigated for steers grazing buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) pastures with and without access to leucaena-grass pastures (Leucaena leucocephala spp. glabrata + perennial, tropical grass (C4) species) or forage oats (Avena sativa) for varying intervals throughout their growth path. The production, economic and financial effect of each growth path was assessed by comparison to a base scenario that produced finished, slaughter steers (605 kg) from buffel grass pastures. The relative profitability of marketing steers at feedlot entry (feed-on) weight (474 kg) instead of slaughter weights was also assessed. The growth paths were applied within two beef enterprises, namely (1) steer turnover and (2) breeding and finishing. For both enterprises, grazing steers on leucaena-grass pastures from weaning until they achieved feedlot entry weight (474 kg) was substantially more profitable than any other growth path. Compared with the base scenario, this optimal growth path improved profitability by 121% and 37% for the steer turnover and the breeding and finishing enterprises respectively. The purchase of additional breeders for the latter enterprise was required to optimise utilisation of the leucaena-grass pastures immediately. Incorporating leucaena-grass pastures at any steer age improved the profitability of the steer turnover enterprise (AU$7368-AU$106508 extra profit/annum), and similarly for the breeding and finishing enterprise (AU$1754-AU$31383 extra profit/annum) except for two scenarios where leucaena-grass pastures were provided to older steers targeted at the feed-on market (AU$4816 and AU$23886 less profit/annum). However, incorporation of leucaena-grass into steer growth paths also resulted in increased peak deficit levels and financial risk to the business compared with buffel grass-only production systems, with payback periods for the most profitable growth path of 8 and 14 years for the steer turnover and the breeding and finishing enterprise respectively. All growth paths that incorporated forage oats and leucaena-grass resulted in lower economic and financial performance than did comparable growth paths that incorporated leucaena-grass only. Furthermore, incorporating oats into buffel grass-only growth paths always reduced the enterprise profitability.

Using the eddycovariance technique, we quantified the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) in a semi-arid shrubland of northern China from July 2011 to December 2016, and partitioned NEE into Reco and gross primary productivity (GPP). Annual Reco varied from 300 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014 to 426 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2012, and GPP ranged from 277 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2014 to 503 g Cm-2 yr(-1) in 2012. The relationship between half-hourly nighttime Reco and air temperature (Ta) was well-described by the Lloyd & Taylor model. Indicators of the seasonal temperature sensitivity (E-0 and Q(10)) of Reco increased with both the annual integral and seasonal amplitude of GPP. However, when averaged into 1 degrees C T-a bins, nighttime Reco increased with T-a up to an optimal temperature of similar to 20 degrees C, abovewhich it decreased with increasing Ta. Periods of low soil moisture in spring and summer markedly depressed Reco, contributing to its seasonal and interannual variations. In addition, low soil moisture had little effect on nighttime Reco when T-a was below 15 degrees C, but substantially reduced nighttime Reco when T-a was above 15 degrees C. Ecosystem respiration increased linearly with GPP at both seasonal and interannual scales, with the slope being 0.50 and 0.55, respectively. Our results have important implications for predicting Reco under climate change, considering continuous warming and increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme events (e.g., heatwaves, droughts). Moreover, our results suggest that process-based carbon models should adequately represent the effects of substrate supply (e.g., by GPP) on Reco and its temperature sensitivity.

Replacing fallow with field pea in wheat production systems across western Nebraska	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Integration of field pea (Pisum sativum L.) (FP) into dryland cropping systems has increased due to ecological and economic benefits, paired with a growing market for pea-derived products. Challenges exist in the High Plains that limit the integration of crop rotations to replace fallow periods with FP in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)based systems. This experiment compares chemical summer fallow to FP in a fallow-wheat rotation at two locations in western Nebraska. Soil water content, soil fertility, N mineralization, FP yield, and subsequent hard red winter wheat (HWW) yields were recorded. Subsequent HWW yields were not different between crop sequences (P = .42). The interaction of site-year with crop sequence explained the HWW yield differences (P = .0005), mostly due to precipitation variability among site-years. Most soil parameters tested only showed amain effect of date due to temporal changes in soil nutrient cycling. Replacing summer fallow with FP resulted in reduced soil water content, however, that did not result in long-term moisture deficiency due to crop sequence type. System annualized gross revenue was equal to or greater for 2 site-years for FP compared with fallow, with an average increase of US$113.15 ha(-1). Pea-wheat reduced annualized net losses in 1 site-year by $70 ha(-1) compared with fallow-wheat in the "average" pricing model. Among 3 site-years and three pricing models, pea-wheat resulted in greater net profit or reduced net losses compared with fallow-wheat in 5 site-year comparisons.

To effectively generate reliable estimates of crop yield the magnitude and patterns of G x E in regional yield trials should be specified. This research aimed to (1) investigate existing possible mega-environments (ME) and suitability of test locations for winter wheat zoning, and (2) determine the role of climatic factors in clustering patterns of G x E. Winter wheat yield data from a three-year nationwide yield trial consisting of 24 genotypes grown in 24 test environments supplemented with 37 climatic factors were subjected to empirical and analytical analyses. Standard deviation-scaled genotype main effect and G x E interaction (SD-GGE) biplot methodology, factorial regression and partial least square regression were applied to both analyses. The combined ANOVA showed that the environmental effect was the main source of variation (83%), and the magnitude of G x E interaction was sixfold greater than genotype alone. The SD-GGE biplot confirmed non-repeatable patterns for grouping of test locations across years, indicating significant (P < 0.01) rank-change location-by-year interactions and existence of strong "crossover" G x E interactions. This led to the conclusion that the winter wheat growing region in Iran consists of a single but complex ME for grain yield, suggesting that high-yielding-and stable winter wheat genotypes should be developed for the entire region rather than genotypes adapted to specific agro-ecological regions. Precipitation (monthly and total) and temperature (minimum, maximum and average) accounted for 25.4% and 56.8% of total G x E.

The potential impact of these newly established agricultural lands on the surrounding environment is of great concern. Local studies have shown that deforestation leads to changes in the soil-water balance, and can expedite groundwater rise and mobilization of water-soluble salts to the surface affecting plant growth and crop productivity. This study is a regional assessment of soil salinity and salinization processes in the central Argentinean Dry Chaco. It is based on extensive dataset of 492 surface and 142 subsurface samples taken along east-west transects across the Dry Chaco. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) was used as an indicator of salinity, and supplementary information on salt crusts was derived from Google Earth imagery. Subsurface salinity (i.e., measured at 100 cm depth) showed clear regional patterns in natural soil salinity that are related to the annual water budget and topography. Besides primary salinization due to arrested drainage and landscape stagnation, anthropogenic activities increased secondary salinization, especially in the agricultural areas with shallow groundwater tables and irrigated croplands. In addition, the study demonstrated that remotely-sensed vegetation indices such as the seasonal variation in the density of green vegetation are particularly suitable to monitor regional variation in soil salinity. Our results show that the extent of future dryland salinization in the Dry Chaco will mainly depend on whether areas prone to natural soil salinity are further protected from deforestation, and the magnitude and rate of groundwater rise after deforestation as conditioned by local climate and geomorphology. This better understanding of soil salinity patterns and how they are affected as a result of anthropogenic activities is important for the implementation of appropriate and effective measures to prevent severe salinization.					; De Lannoy, Gabrielle/C-9101-2017	Maertens, Michiel/0000-0003-0460-0305; De Lannoy, Gabrielle/0000-0002-6743-7122													2213-3054					MAR	2022	37								100322	10.1016/j.ancene.2022.100322	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ancene.2022.100322		FEB 2022											WOS:000788074600003

To improve urban sustainability and construct ecological security barriers, it is essential to quantify the spatial patterns of urbanization level on the TP, but the existing studies on the topic have been limited by the lack of socioeconomic data. This study aims to quantify the urbanization level on the TP in 2018 with Luojia1-01 (LJ1-01) high-resolution nighttime light (NTL) data. Specifically, the compounded night light index is used to quantify spatial patterns of urbanization level at multiple scales. The results showed that the TP had a low overall urbanization level with a large internal difference. The urbanization level in the northeast, southeast and south of the TP was relatively high, forming three hotspots centered in Xining City, Lhasa City and Shangri-La City, while the urbanization level in the central and western regions was relatively low. The analysis of influencing factors, based on the random forest model, showed that transportation and topography were the main factors affecting the TP's spatial patterns of urbanization level. The comparison analysis with socioeconomic statistics and traditional NTL data showed that LJ1-01 NTL data can be used to more effectively quantify the urbanization level since it is more advantageous for reflecting the spatial extent of urban land and describing the spatial structure of socioeconomic activities within urban areas. These advantages are attributed to the high spatial resolution of the data, appropriate imaging time and unaffected by saturation phenomena. Thus, the proposed LJ1-01 NTL-based urbanization level measurement method has the potential for wide applications around the world, especially in less-developed regions lacking statistical data. Using this method, we refined the measurement of the TP's urbanization level in 2018 for multiple scales including the region, basin, prefecture and county levels, which provides basic information for the further urban sustainability research on the TP.					刘, 海猛/AAP-3802-2020; Liu, Zhifeng/IWU-7476-2023; Liu, Haimeng/ACQ-9123-2022; Liu, Haimeng/R-7364-2018	Liu, Zhifeng/0000-0002-4087-0743; Liu, Haimeng/0000-0003-0390-9140; Liu, Haimeng/0000-0003-0390-9140; liu, zhifeng/0000-0001-5124-9824													2096-7438	2666-6839				SEP	2020	1	3					233	244		10.1016/j.geosus.2020.08.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geosus.2020.08.004													WOS:000646625700008
J	Dong, Q; Dang, TH; Guo, SL; Hao, MD				Dong, Qiang; Dang, Tinghui; Guo, Shengli; Hao, Mingde			Effect of different mulching measures on nitrate nitrogen leaching in spring maize planting system in south of Loess Plateau	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Field experiment was conducted in the southern gully region of the Loess Plateau to study the effects of different mulching measures on spring maize yield and nitrate leaching in dryland under the traditional tillage conditions, so as to provide a scientific basis for spring maize planting and environmental protection in this area. The four treatments included non-mulching (CK), plastic film-mulching (PM1), plastic film-mulching in fallow (PM2) and straw-mulching (JM). After 13 years of continuous application, the yield of spring maize, the nitrogen uptake by plants and the nitrate nitrogen content at the harvest stage were measured. The results showed that the soil moisture content and water storage capacity of three kinds of soil mulching treatments were all higher than those of non-mulching ones. Soil water storage in the range of 0 similar to 300 cm of JM, PM1 and PM2 increased by 11.8%, 10.6% and 8.8% respectively compared with CK. Compared with CK, the mulching treatments significantly increased the aboveground biomass and grain yield of spring maize. The yield enhancement effect of PM l was the most significant, with a yield of 11,314.42 kg / ha and an increase of 26.72%. In addition to the JM treatment, the accumulation of soil nitrate nitrogen in the range of 0 - 300 cm of PM1 and PM2 was less than that of CK, but the increase of nitrate nitrogen of 80.20% of JM treatment was in the range of 0 similar to 100 cm. Therefore, in the rain-fed agriculture in the south of Loess Plateau, mulching cultivation can effectively increase the soil moisture content and water storage, improve crop growth. The yield enhancement effect of plastic mulching-film was the best. PM1, PM2 could significantly reduce the content and accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in soil profile, and the three mulching measures could slow the deep leaching of soil nitrate nitrogen to a certain extent.

J	Sagi, N; Grünzweig, JM; Hawlena, D				Sagi, Nevo; Grunzweig, Jose M.; Hawlena, Dror			Burrowing detritivores regulate nutrient cycling in a desert ecosystem	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Nutrient cycling in most terrestrial ecosystems is controlled by moisture-dependent decomposer activity. In arid ecosystems, plant litter cycling exceeds rates predicted based on precipitation amounts, suggesting that additional factors are involved. Attempts to reveal these factors have focused on abiotic degradation, soil-litter mixing and alternative moisture sources. Our aim was to explore an additional hypothesis that macro-detritivores control litter cycling in deserts. We quantified the role different organisms play in clearing plant detritus from the desert surface, using litter baskets with different mesh sizes that allow selective entry of micro-, meso- or macrofauna. We also measured soil nutrient concentrations in increasing distances from the burrows of a highly abundant macro-detritivore, the desert isopod Hemilepistus reaumuri. Macro-detritivores controlled the clearing of plant litter in our field site. The highest rates of litter removal were measured during the hot and dry summer when isopod activity peaks and microbial activity is minimal. We also found substantial enrichment of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorous near isopod burrows. We conclude that burrowing macro-detritivores are important regulators of litter cycling in this arid ecosystem, providing a plausible general mechanism that explains the unexpectedly high rates of plant litter cycling in deserts.

The legume alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), which can fix N2, might potentially strengthen P limitation in dryland ecosystems and is widely distributed as forage. However, there is still unclear how alfalfa grassland mobilizes the soil P to meet its demand. In this experiment, alfalfa introduction was used for long-term revegetation to evaluate the P uptake of plants from deep soil and assess the P limitation induced by N deposition compared with fallow. Our results showed that alfalfa introduction increased the soil P storage significantly at 0-2.4 m soil depth (+0.74 Mg ha -1), whereas it decreased at 2.4-4.8 m soil depth (-0.21 Mg ha -1) after 15-year establishment. Alfalfa establishment increased soil organic P concentration (180.9 mg kg -1 vs. 67.2 mg kg -1) and its relative contribution to total P (19.64% vs. 8.08%) at 0-4.8 m. Alfalfa establishment also increased the concentration and proportion of labile and intermediate P fractions at 0-4.8 m (9.12 mg kg -1 vs. 6.87 mg kg -1, 1.12% vs. 0.98%; 16.06 mg kg -1 vs. 8.39 mg kg -1, 1.69% vs. 1.17%). Alfalfa introduction decreased the concentrated HCl-Pi (250.66 mg kg -1 vs. 229.32 mg kg -1, 36.81% vs. 28.91%) in 2.4-4.8 m soil depth. These results indicated that the deep root system of alfalfa grassland could promote the P mobilization from deep to shallow soil. The concentrated HCl-Pi may be the main potential P source of alfalfa from 2.4-4.8 m to 0-2.4 m of soil depth, and long-term establishment of alfalfa can alleviate P limitation caused by N deposition in carbonate soil. Our results suggested that species with deep roots (such as alfalfa) could be selected as an economical way to mitigate nitrogen deposition in drylands.

Palustrine wetland formation during the MIS 3 interstadial: Implications for preserved alluvial records in the South African Karoo	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Dryland alluvial successions across interior South Africa arc a focus of pedosedimentary research because they provide insights into past hydrogeomorphic changes and improve our understanding of allogenic and autogenic controls on fluvial system behaviour. This paper focuses on an alluvial succession preserved within the Wilgerbosch River, on the Great Escarpment, South Africa. The pedosedimentary architecture of a caicretized palaeosol formed within an abandoned MIS 3 (51-39 ka) floodplain was investigated using grain size, micromorphological, XRD and mineral magnetic analyses. The primary controls on pedogenesis are inferred and the impacts of their products on subsequent landscape development outlined. The biologically-dominated calcrete micromorphology is consistent with the rhizogenic calcrete variety, which together with XRD, grain size and soil magnetic data provides evidence for a palustrine palaeowetland system. Palustrine wetland systems have been documented across interior South Africa, but the formation of rhizogenic calcretes in association with these systems has, to our knowledge, not been reported previously. We interpret these palaeowetlands to have resulted from basin-wide hydrogeomorphic adjustments, rather than localised discontinuous channel and floodout processes. Magnetic enhancement of the soil column overlying the calcrete compared to the overlying floodplain deposits is indicative of moister climate conditions at similar to 51 ka relative to similar to 39 ka. We hypothesise that the longevity of geomorphic quiescence, coupled with relatively moist climate conditions in early MIS 3 resulted in enhanced soil CaCO3 accumulation. The resultant cementation of this abandoned floodplain deposit accounts for an alluvial record that is dominated by older rather than younger (e.g. Holocene) deposits, despite the narrow valley context (<150 m). These findings illustrate the interplay of factors that may generate sedimentary records in this and other confined catchment systems. Such insights may aid interpretation of palustrine wetlands formed in tectonically-stable dryland inland valleys preserved within the geological record. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

However, the watershed territories of the drylands, where the majority of human activities are concentrated have long experienced strained human-land relationships, culminating in ecological security concerns. Correspondingly, it is essential to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the ecological security of dryland watersheds and to identify the key factors influencing ecological security in order to formulate strategies that ensure the sustainability of drylands. Premised on the Driving-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model, this study developed an ecological security index and applied it to the Irtysh River Basin of Xinjiang, China, from 2000 to 2020. The obstacle degree model was applied to reveal the obstacles in two dimensions: criterion level and indicator level. The findings suggested that the ecological security comprehensive index in the Irtysh River Basin has increased significantly from 2000 to 2020, irrespective of the fact that it decreased during the study period and then increased. The ecological security level changed from 'critically safe' in 2000 to 'general safety' in 2020, with the state subsystem and pressure subsystem becoming ecological security weaknesses. The primary factors influencing the ecological security of the study area were water consumption, the area of high-efficiency water-saving irrigation, the proportion of wetland area, vegetation coverage, and livestock population. The ecological security of different counties in the basin varies greatly, whereas the factors that influence ecological security showed both similarities and differences among the counties. In light of on the findings, we proposed that future strategies for ecological security enhancement should concentrate on enacting the policy of localizing spatial differentiation, optimizing industrial structure, strengthening scientific and technological support in the field of water conservation, bolstering the treatment capacity of environmental facilities, and implementing the Mountains-Rivers-Forests-Farmlands-Lakes-Grasslands System to support the sustainable development of dryland watersheds.																			1002-0063	1993-064X				JUN	2023	33	3			SI		393	409		10.1007/s11769-023-1347-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-023-1347-z		MAR 2023						37260454					WOS:000946962100002

To better understand how the vegetation varies at monthly scale and its effect by climate conditions in different desert areas, this study first investigated the seasonal variation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Then, we analyzed the time effects of diverse climatic factors (air temperature, solar radiation, precipitation) on NDVI and estimated the limitation of NDVI by these climatic factors in different desert areas. The result showed that the mean monthly NDVI during 1982-2015 showed a unimodal variation in most desert areas, with high values in late spring and summer over cold arid areas, in early spring or early autumn over hot arid areas, and in summer over polar areas, respectively. Solar radiation and precipitation in cold arid areas presented 1-2 month lag or accumulation effect on NDVI, while precipitation in most hot arid areas showed no remarkable time-lag but 3 month accumulation effect, and all three climate factors in polar areas exhibited 1-3 month accumulation effect. The explanatory power of climatic conditions for vegetation dynamics considering time effects increased by 3.4, 10.8, and 5.9% for the cold arid areas, hot arid areas, and polar areas (i.e., relative increase of 4.1, 25.4, and 8.2%), respectively. The main climatic constraints to vegetation dynamics were the water condition in hot arid areas (>78%) and the temperature condition in polar areas (>67%), while cold arid areas were simultaneously limited by the water and temperature conditions (>76% in total).

In this study, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and next-generation sequencing were used to compare bacterial abundance, community structure and predicted metabolic function under four agricultural practices in Ultisol: without fertilization (control), mineral fertilization (NPK, conven-tional regime), mineral fertilization with returning composting peanut straw (NPKS) and with planting hairy vetch (NPKG). Compared to the control, the NPKS and NPKG significantly decreased soil pH. The NPKG was associated with the highest soil nutrient contents and peanut yield. Compared to control, the NPKS and NPKG increased bacterial abundance and decreased bacterial alpha-diversity. Fertility improvement and soil acidifi-cation were responsible for increasing bacterial abundance and decreasing alpha-diversity, respectively. Phylogenetic clustering was found in soil bacterial community, with the stronger clustering in NPKS and NPKG, suggesting that soil acidification might induce stronger niche-based filtering to decrease bacterial alpha-diversity. Compared to control, the NPKS and NPKG altered soil bacterial community composition, but only NPKG changed the predicted metabolic functions. The NPKG triggered larger changes in bacterial community composition than NPKS, implying that dramatic shifts in community composition might lead to modification of bacterial functions. Soil bacterial community composition and predicted function co-varied with soil pH and nutrient contents, but nutrient improvement had stronger (i.e., 23.3% vs. 11.5% in composition; 21.8% vs. 13.6% in function) and contrary effects (i.e., the opposite arrows) than soil acidification. In addition, the NPKG was associated with higher relative abundance of plant-beneficial bacterial taxa (Mycobacterium and Pseudo-monas). Overall, mineral fertilization with planting hairy vetch might be an effective practice for improving soil fertility, optimizing bacterial community structure and increasing peanut yield in dryland of Ultisol. However, the further soil acidification should be taken into account following planting hairy vetch longer.

Electronic transponders with RFID technology (2.1 x 12.2 mm) were implanted subcutaneously (D0) in the scutiform cartilage. The animals consisted of four groups: CLF-I (17 calves; 2.1 +/- 1.9 months), CLF-II (20 calves; 5.1 +/- 3.2 months), HFR (20 heifers; 22 +/- 4.7 months) and STR (19 steers; 26.6 +/- 6.7 months). The animals were kept under pasture grazing, a part of the year in the dryland and a part in the floodplain, and were monitored for up to 350 days. The average time required for individual transponder implant was 49.46 s, while the time required for reading the code was 3.76 s. The older calves required higher time for individual implant (P = 0.0001) and closer approximation of the reader in the D150 (P = 0.0001). The mean read distance was 2.98 cm in D0 and 1.94 cm in D150. The magnitude of the subcutaneous transponder migration was minimal, and was within an area of 17.2 mm(2). A slight bleeding was observed in 15.79% of the animals during the implant. A decreasing incidence of edema was observed until D21, with the heifers being more sensitive until that time (P = 0.0099). Considering the results, it is preferred to implant electronic transponders in calves up to two months of age. The physical rate of transponder loss was 1.3% and the loss of functionality was 9.2%. High reading rate was achieved when animals were raised both in dryland (93.9%) and floodplain (97.2%). Thus, the electronic identification of water buffaloes is a technique capable of replacing traditional and rudimentary methods to identify buffaloes and can provide safe identification of animals.

Contemporary channel adjustment and geomorphic sensitivity of the lower Mara River and its floodplain wetlands, Tanzania	GEOMORPHOLOGY												An understanding of river adjustment processes, previous landform changes, and sensitivity to flow regimes are prerequisites for predicting how rivers may respond to future climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. Geomorphic river sensitivity is an important concept that can be used to assess the capacity of adjustment for a river type and forecast river responses to hydroclimatic change over time. In this study, we use satellite imagery to characterise and quantify recent geomorphic river adjustment in a dryland river in East Africa, over the past 32 years (1988-2020). The natural or expected river behaviour (i.e., behavioural regime) and capacity for adjustment (i.e., valley confinement) are quantified to provide a measure of the reach-scale geomorphic sensitivity of the lower Mara River, Tanzania. Two behavioural river sensitivity classes are identified. The upper reach is classified as Passive sensitive, exhibiting a limited range of bend adjustments and low migration rates (0.89 m a-1) owing to valley confinement and capacity to recover from disturbance events. The middle reach is classified as Fragile and shows the greatest capacity to adjust in response to intrinsic fluxes. This reach is characterised by numerous lateral migration features and cut-offs (0.2/km) on the floodplain and exhibits the highest migration rates (1.39 m a-1). The lower reach is also categorised as Passive sensitive and undergoes bend and boundary adjustments within its behavioural regime and exhibits the lowest migration rates (0.63 m a-1). However, this reach appears to be operating close to a threshold state and if subjected to a threshold-breaching disturbance event it may 'switch' to a Fragile system where avulsions are dominant. The Mara River shows that geomorphic sensitivity is an important consideration in assessing system response to short-term variability and forecasting future river behaviour and will be key in guiding the management and rehabilitation efforts of other dryland wetlands under different land use and climate change scenarios.

With this context, the present study was aimed to evaluate the impact of animal manures (sheep and poultry manure) and plant residue-based organic amendments (rice husk biochar and sugarcane pressmud) on soil quality, nutrient uptake and balance, yield, and sustainability of rice-wheat cropping in alluvial (rainfed) and red lateritic soil (dryland) of middle Gangetic plains (Narayanpur) and Vindhyan region (Rajgarh) of Mirzapur district in eastern UP. The field experiments were conducted for three years at the above two sites and amendments were done at a rate by replacing 30% standard recommended doses of fertilizer (RDF) for rice-wheat cropping system. Field trials were conducted with the 100% RDF as control, and 70% RDF with sheep manure, poultry manure, rice-husk biochar and sugarcane pressmud in a randomized block design. The organic amendments were done during the rice cultivation stage and the residual effect was observed during the subsequent wheat cultivation. Though soil organic carbon (SOC) was found to show significant (p >= 0.05) increase in biochar amended plots, animal manures followed by pressmud showed year wise increase in both SOC and microbial biomass carbon. In rainfed areas, plant growth and yield attributes for both rice and wheat were at par in amendments than control while in dryland, the 100% RDF showed better performance during the first year, after that amended plot showed better performance. All amendments resulted in higher benefit: cost ratio except biochar addition in Narayanpur, whereas in Rajgarh, the poultry manure resulted in significant improvement in benefit: cost ratio from second year onward. Our study advocates that validation of suitable amendment packages based on organic inputs are imperative for improving the yield, soil quality and nutrient balance of rice-wheat cropping system and thereby attaining the UN-SDGs at the village/local level.

Our research focuses on the joint analysis of both modifying the model process and using parameter optimization techniques to improve the models performance in a semi-arid grassland ecosystem in Xinjiang, China. The study presents a comparison of the simulated carbon and water fluxes by replacing the root water uptake function (RWUF) of the CoLM and by using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize the most sensitive parameters. Prior to PSO, the method of Morris one-factor-at-a-time (MOAT) is utilized to screen out parameters that have strong effects on gross primary production (GPP) and latent heat flux (LE) in CoLM. Either modifying the root water uptake process in the CoLM or optimizing model parameters can significantly reduce the biases of the simulated GPP, LE, and water use efficiency (WUE). The coefficient of determination (R-2) with the modified RWUF in the CoLM increases from 0.85 to 0.92 for GPP and from 0.76 to 0.81 for LE. Meanwhile, the root mean square error (RMSE) decreases from 3.57 mu mol m(-2) S-1 to 2.78 mu mol m(-2) S-1 for GPP and from 50.75 W m(-2) to 46.85 W m(-2) for LE. Using the PSO approach, the R-2 increases to 0.89 and RMSE decreases to 2.92 mu mol m(-2) S-1 for GPP, while, the R-2 increases to 0.79 and RMSE decreases to 46.16 W m(-2) for LE. Therefore, modifying the model process contributed more to improve the model simulations than using parameter estimation techniques. Our study recommends that a justified refinement in model structure plays vital role in quantifying the carbon and water fluxes in dryland ecosystems or other ecosystems.

The aim of this study is to study a dryland drainage system with a clearly limited regional catchment area, whose drainage and sedimentation behavior is unaffected by distant meteorological events or changes in climatic outside the region. Our results highlight for the first time the widespread occurrence of fluvial and lacustrine sediments in the Naukluft Mts. foreland as part of the Great Escarpment and their potential as Late Quaternary geoarchives. The region's special interest and overarching value lies (i) in the bounded catchments of both the lacustrine BtillsPort Playa and the ephemeral rivers Tsauchab and Tsondab within the South African Great Escarpment and (ii) in the rivers' endorheic character and dead ends within the Namib Sand Sea to the West. All these lacustrine and fluvial systems first and foremost exclude supra-regional influences within the flow regime. Uniquely, the key palaeoclimatic question of periodical shifts of the rainfall zones during Holocene and Late Glacial times can be studied in both these catchments. This study also combines new data from the semi-desert environment of the Naukluft Mts. with data from the terminus sites Sossusvlei and Tsondabvlei within the Namib dunes. From our interpretation of the desert flash flood series, the drainage history from pre-LGM times within MIS 3 up to modem times is represented in our data. The Late Tennination I was the period with the highest flow rates post MES3, raising the Urikos Terrace. This must have been caused by strong monsoonal rainfall events from summer TTT, giving rise to extreme flash floods. Little Ice Age sediments have filled the entire thalweg, with the exception of remnant Holocene to MIS 3 terraces to the sides and provide a unique framework for ecological conditions.

This paper is aimed at investigating the effect of biochar (BC) on a desert sandy soil (Al Foah, United Arab Emirates) in terms of bulk density, porosity, water retention, plant available water (AW(max)), aggregate stability (AS) and specific surface area (BET-SSA). BC was produced from forest biomass (Italy). Soil water retention was measured by the High Energy Moisture Characteristic (HEMC) and by pressure plate measurements, by using BC fractions equal to 0 (soil only), 0.014, 0.091, 0.23, 0.33 and 1 (BC only). The results indicated that BC significantly (p = 0.05) increased soil porosity and the amount of storage pores. As a consequence, water retention was enhanced and AW(max) from 19.3 mm/m for the sandy soil (f(bc) = 0), to 60.8, 102.3 and 107.6 at f(bc) = 0.091, 0.23, and 0.33, respectively, was raised. No significant effects of BC were detected on the soil water retention curve of the BC-amended soil at f(bc) = 0.014, compared to the original condition. The significant increase in the structural index (SI) at f(bc),>= 0.091, indicated that BC improved soil aggregate stability. The BET-SSA was measured by nitrogen adsorption measurements and indicated that the connected porosity was significantly increased by the 0.091 BC fraction. Both AW(max) and SI were found to be correlated with BET-SSA. This showed an outcome that has been so far little investigated, namely that the BET-SSA played a significant role in the mechanism affecting the soil response to BC addition. The results showed that application of BC can improve soil structure and water retention and therefore optimize irrigation management by reducing irrigation needs, in the Al-Foah area and/or in similar dryland regions.

It is important to study the complex coupling relationship between economic development and ecological protection in the urban-rural fringe from a holistic and dynamic perspective. The complex network theory is utilized in this study to analyze how land use change (LUC) affects ecosystems' structural and functional vulnerabilities. From the perspective of network modeling and analysis, the network eco-efficiency indicator for the vulnerability analysis of the land transfer network is defined considering the ecological cost and value in this study. Based on this, we propose a method for analyzing the vulnerability of the functioning of land ecosystem. In order to testify the effectiveness of the method, this study takes the southeastern corner of the Pidu District of Chengdu as the research object. The result shows: (1) Under the combined effect of urban expansion and rural revitalization, the utilization of land resources in the region is relatively poor, the development of urbanization is slow, and the rural ecological environment has not been improved; (2) The ecological land is the transfer-out type, the artificial land is the transfer-in type. Grassland is the primary key land type that is essential to the network's connectivity but also the most at risk to attack. Although the stability of the land ecosystem is not great, it is generally progressing in a stable direction; (3) To maintain the resilience of the land ecosystem and alleviate the vulnerability, at least 85% of the dryland and 45% of the urban residential land need to be protected; (4) A 20% increase of dryland and paddy is positive to enhancing the resilience of the ecosystem and reducing the negative impact on the ecosystem in the process of land use transition. The research results can provide a reference for the coordinated development of "land-economy-ecology" in the urban-rural fringe.

Understanding how vegetation changes and its response to climatic shift is of vital importance for describing their mutual relationships and projecting future land-climate interactions. Arid areas are considered to be regions that respond most strongly to climate change. Xinjiang, as a typical dryland in China, has received great attention lately for its unique ecological environment. However, comprehensive studies examining vegetation change and its driving factors across Xinjiang are rare. Here, we used the remote sensing datasets (MOD13A2 and TerraClimate) and data of meteorological stations to investigate the trends in the dynamic change in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and its response to climate change from 2000 to 2019 across Xinjiang based on the Google Earth platform. We found that the increment rates of growth-season mean and maximum NDVI were 0.0011 per year and 0.0013 per year, respectively, by averaging all of the pixels from the region. The results also showed that, compared with other land use types, cropland had the fastest greening rate, which was mainly distributed among the northern Tianshan Mountains and Southern Junggar Basin and the northern margin of the Tarim Basin. The vegetation browning areas primarily spread over the Ili River Valley where most grasslands were distributed. Moreover, there was a trend of warming and wetting across Xinjiang over the past 20 years; this was determined by analyzing the climate data. Through correlation analysis, we found that the contribution of precipitation to NDVI (R-2 = 0.48) was greater than that of temperature to NDVI (R-2 = 0.42) throughout Xinjiang. The Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was also computed to better investigate the correlation between climate change and vegetation growth in arid areas. Our results could improve the local management of dryland ecosystems and provide insights into the complex interaction between vegetation and climate change.

This collection represents two discreet chronological phases (ca. 2200 and 9600-10800 radiocarbon years before present (RCYBP)) and suggests the use of a wide array of faunal and floral resources found adjacent to the cave complex. Here we compare macrofossils, animal hair and pollen recovered from these samples with regional ethnographic and historic data to infer probable exploitation of dietary resources by the inhabitants of the rockshelter. Our results suggest that the residents of the Paisley Caves during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene transition followed subsistence regimes heavily reliant on lagomorphs and dryland plant resources similar to those employed by later Native groups.

In this study, we analyzed the effect of wax content on leaf permeability by measuring the wax loss rate in the leaf. To further clarify the wax composition of the wheat epidermis and its molecular regulation mechanism, we applied untargeted lipidomic and transcriptome analysis on the leaf epidermis wax of Jimai 22 low-wax mutant (waxless) and multi-wax mutant (waxy). Our research showed that the mutant waxy has a slow loss rate, which can maintain higher leaf water content. 31 lipid subclasses and 1,367 lipid molecules were identified. By analyzing the wax differences of the two mutants, we found that the main lipid components of leaf epidermis wax in Jimai 22 were WE (C19-C50), DG (C27-C53), MG (C31-C35), and OAHFA (C31-C52). Carbon chain length analysis showed that, in wheat epidermis wax, WE was dominated by C44 molecules, DG was mainly concentrated in C47, C45, C37, and C31 molecules, C48 played a leading role in OAHFA, and C35 and C31 played a major role in MG. Among them, DG, MG, and OAHFA were detected in wheat leaf wax for the first time, and they were closely related to stress resistance. Compared with the waxy, 6,840 DEGs were detected in the mutant waxless, 3,181 DEGs were upregulated, and 3,659 DEGs were downregulated. The metabolic pattern of main waxy components in the wheat epidermis was constructed according to KEGG metabolic pathway and 46 related genes were screened, including KSC, TER, FAR, WSD1, CER1, MAH1, ALDH7A1, CYP704B1, ACOT1_2_4, CYP86, MGLL, GPAT, ALDH, DPP1, dgkA, plsC, and E2.3.1.158 related genes. The screened wax-related genes were confirmed to be highly reliable by qRT-PCR. In addition, we found TER gene TraesCS6B03G1132900LC in wheat mutant waxless leaves for the first time, which inhibited the synthesis of long-chain acyl-CoA (n+2) by downregulating its expression. These results provide valuable reference information for further study of wheat epidermis wax heredity and molecular regulation.																				1664-8021				DEC 6	2021	12								757920	10.3389/fgene.2021.757920	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.757920								34938312					WOS:000732258400001
J	Wang, XJ; Xie, L; Xu, LL				Wang, Xiaojuan; Xie, Ling; Xu, Lulu			Soil Bacterial Community Structure and Function under the Substitution of Chemical Fertilizer with Maize Straw	AGRONOMY-BASEL												The long-term extensive application of chemical fertilizers wreaks havoc on soil bacterial structure and function. To reduce the damage caused by chemical fertilizers, a six-year experiment was performed to study the effects of replacing 0% (CK), 25% (S25), 50% (S50), 75% (S75), and 100% (S100) of 225 kg ha(-1) mineral nitrogen fertilizer with an equivalent amount of nitrogen from maize straw on the soil bacterial community structure, diversity, and function. The results showed that Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes were the dominant soil bacterial phyla after the replacement treatments. Replacing mineral nitrogen fertilizer with an equivalent amount of nitrogen from maize straw significantly reduced the number of Photobacterium and bacterial populations involved in genetic information processing in soil, but significantly increased the number of bacterial populations involved in organismal systems, human diseases, and environmental information processing. Compared with other treatments, the relative abundance of TK10 significantly increased by 33.52-76.36% in S25. The number of subgroup 6, Gram-negative, biofilm-forming, potentially pathogenic, and anaerobic bacteria significantly increased, whereas that of Chloroflexi and Blastocatellia subgroup 4 significantly decreased in S50 and S75 compared with CK. The number of TK10 and Blastocatellia subgroup 4 in S50 and S100, respectively, was significantly lower than that in CK. Bacterial species were significantly more present in S25 than in S75. The diversity of bacterial species in S75 was significantly lower than that in CK. S25 and S100 were more favorable to increasing the number of Gram-positive, aerobic, mobile-element containing, and stress-tolerant bacteria. Rhodobacteraceae, Pyrinomonadaceae, Xanthobacteraceae, Nocardioidaceae, and Vulgatibacteraceae with statistical differences in CK, S25, S50, S75, and S100, respectively, could be used as biomarkers. Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, and Nitrospirae could be used as the main basis for the bacterial classification of soil samples in the equivalent substitution of nitrogen chemical fertilizer with maize straw. S25 is ideal for increasing soil bacterial species richness and abundance.

However, the integrated effects and relationships of various policies are still not well understood. This study observed the land use land cover changes in Central Jilin from 2000 to 2019 and, by considering policy involvement, aimed to understand the effects and trade-offs of policies. Results showed that the cropland, including dryland and rice paddy, and the forest, including coniferous forest and deciduous forest, are dominant land types in Central Jilin. During 2000-2019, the land changed diversely, of which the main changes were the expanded dryland (+0.43 million ha), the increased deciduous forest (+22 million ha), the decreased coniferous forest (-0.08 million ha), and the expanded urban settlement (+0.04 million ha). With these changes, despite the unit grain yield showing a rising trend, the yield contribution of Central Jilin to the national total decreased. The poor cultivating structure made for the cropland expansion and reduced the implementation space of environmental restoration projects such as the Grain to Green. Thus, in Central Jilin that transits from the agri-food production zone to the eco-regulation zone, environmental projects coexisted in a trade-off manner with agricultural policies that aim to liberate agricultural productivity. In the key urban agglomerations of Central Jilin, the increase in the proportion of green space improved the thermal environment and carbon balance. The gross domestic product of the large city and its local proportion also rose. These improvements benefited from the promotion of development policies and urbanization policies at key time points. In the future, it is necessary to coordinate agricultural policies and environmental projects and promote the progress of small- and medium-sized cities to ensure the equality of regional development. This study has implications for making decisions to revitalize Northeast China and researchers who inform decisions.																			1002-0063	1993-064X				APR	2021	31	2					261	275		10.1007/s11769-021-1189-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-021-1189-5													WOS:000655871900006

Additionally, this study sought to analyse the correlations between the contents of different nutrients and to determine the reasons for those correlations.Materials and methodsFive typical land use types, namely, lakeshore sandy land, grassland, forestland, dryland and wetland, were selected in the Xingkai Lake National Nature Reserve. The contents of amorphous iron (Fe-o), complexed iron (Fe-p), dithionite-extractable iron (Fe-d), total iron (TFe), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN) and organic matter (OM) were measured in these soils at two depths: 0-5cm (soil depth 1) and 5-10cm (soil depth 2).Results and discussionFor soil depth 1 and soil depth 2, the land use type had no significant effect on the element contents. For the entire soil depth range (0-10cm), the land use type had the most significant impact on the TP content (p<0.01). Furthermore, soil depth had a significant effect on the contents of Fe-o (p<0.01), TP (p<0.01) and OM (p<0.05). Overall, the element content at soil depth 2 was higher than that at soil depth 1. The interaction between land use type and soil depth significantly influenced the contents of TN and OM (p<0.05). The contents of TN and OM in the lakeshore sandy land and dryland were high, and the contents of TN and OM were highly positively correlated (r=0.90652, p<0.01).ConclusionsDifferent land use types caused different degrees of disturbance in the soil, resulting in differences in the element contents in the soils. The differences in the distribution of soil element contents in the topsoil were the result of important natural and human factors.

Hence, integration of forages in existing crop geometry can ensure production of grain and fodder, simultaneously under rainfed conditions. A field experiment was conducted to study the effect of different nutrient management practices on rice and fodder intercropping systems under rainfed conditions during 2015-2017. The intercropping system comprised (i) sole rice (R), (ii) rice and cowpea (5:2) (CP) and (iii) rice and ricebean (5:2) (RB) whereas the different nutrient management practices comprised (i) application of farm yard manure (FYM) at 5 t ha(-1) (farmers' practice) (N-1), (ii) application of inorganic fertilizer (recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF) of rice, 60:30:30 kg ha(-1) of N:P2O5:K2O) (N-2) and (iii) application of both FYM at 5 t ha(-1) and 50% of RDF inorganic fertilizer (N-3). The results of the experiment revealed that the growth attribute such as leaf area was influenced significantly when fodder crops were taken as intercrops because rice plant was getting more nitrogen from soil due to nitrogen fixation of leguminous fodder crops. Among the nutrient management practices, significant differences in leaf area were found beween N-2 and N-1, and between N-3 and N-1 treatments. However, regarding total number of effective tillers, significant differences were found neither between nutrient management practices nor between cropping systems. The rice equivalent yield (REY) based on price (REYP) was found to be significantly lower in CP (2615 kg ha(-1); -6.4%) and RB intercropping systems (2571 kg ha(-1); -8.0%) than in R monocropping system (2794 kg ha(-1)). However, the REY based on energy (REYE) of CP (2999 kg ha(-1); +7.3%) and RB (2960 kg ha(-1); +5.9%) were found to be significantly higher than that of R (2794 kg ha(-1)) irrespective of nutrient management practices. Between different nutrient management practices, the N-3 treatment recorded the highest REYP and REYE which was at par with the N-2 treatment and significantly higher than the N-1 treatment irrespective of cropping systems. The combined application of both organic and inorganic sources of nutrients helped to supply nutrients throughout the growing season, which led to improved growth parameters and rice yield. The R monocropping system resulted in more income and rain water use efficiency (RWUE) closely followed by rice and fodder intercropping systems. However, the REYE and energy use efficiency (EUE) of rice and fodder intercropping systems were higher than those of R. Also, fodder helped to meet the requirement of cattle feeding in the off-season. Hence, the intercropping system is advocated in the study zone. Further study can be done on ecosystem services and carbon sequestration potential of the intercropping system, as well as the system's coping ability in response to short drought through observing periodic soil moisture regime in root zone.																			2095-3119					DEC	2021	20	12					3114	3126		10.1016/S2095-3119(20)63591-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(20)63591-2		OCT 2021											WOS:000710198300003

It was developed from the cross 'UI Silver' (PI 658467)/ID0660 using a modified bulk breeding method and selected in F-4.6 yield plots. UI Bronze Jade was tested as the experimental number A0709W-44 from 2014 to 2017 and as ID01706 in 2018 and 2019. Compared with the known high-quality hard white check cultivar UI Silver in Idaho and in the Pacific Northwest, UI Bronze Jade had significantly higher grain yield, shorter plant height, and better resistance to stripe rust. UI Bronze Jade is adapted to irrigated and dryland production environments in southeastern Idaho and in rainfed environments in northern Idaho.

J	Amadu, FO				Amadu, Festus O.			Farmer extension facilitators as a pathway for climate smart agriculture: evidence from southern Malawi	CLIMATE POLICY												Climate smart agriculture (CSA) is increasingly vital for enhancing agricultural adaptation to extreme weather shocks and sequestering carbon in the face of climate change. However, CSA adoption remains low in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and other developing regions due to resource constraints and weak agricultural extension systems, among other factors. To reverse this trend and increase CSA adoption, the use of participatory extension services like farmer extension facilitators (FEFs) are increasingly viewed as a pathway to improving extension services in rural communities in SSA and elsewhere. Yet, rigorous analyses of the impacts of the FEF approach as a pathway for CSA adoption remain limited. Here we estimate the impacts of the FEF approach on CSA adoption in terms of resource intensity of CSA practices promoted by FEFs through a large CSA-related intervention in southern Malawi. We apply recursive bivariate probit regression to primary survey data from a sample of 808 households across five districts in the project area across southern Malawi in 2016, accounting for endogeneity and selection bias in farmer interaction with FEFs and the impact of the FEF approach on CSA adoption. Results show that interaction with FEFs had a positive and statistically-significant impact on CSA adoption; low, medium, and high resource intensity CSA categories increased by 42%, 87%, and 96%, respectively. The results suggest that the FEF approach can significantly enhance CSA adoption and thereby contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, including climate action in Malawi, similar contexts in SSA, and elsewhere. Key Policy Insights Participatory extension systems like the FEF approach can improve agricultural extension services in poor communities and thereby enhance CSA adoption in such areas. Smallholder farmer interaction with FEFs can enhance their adoption of resource-intensive CSA practices. Mainstreaming the FEF approach into national adaptation policies and programmes can help scale up CSA adoption in dryland communities. The FEF approach can enhance an achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, including climate action in dryland developing countries.

J	Conyers, M; Bell, R; Bell, M				Conyers, Mark; Bell, Richard; Bell, Michael			Factors influencing the soil-test calibration for Colwell P and wheat under winter-dominant rainfall	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE												Critical ranges for soil tests are based on results that inevitably involve some broad variance around the fitted relationship. Some of the variation is related to field-based factors affecting crop response to nutrients in the soil and some to the efficiency of the soil-test extractant itself. Most attempts to improve soil tests focus on the extractant, whereas here, we explore the variation that could be accounted for by field-based factors in the soil-test calibration relationship between Colwell phosphorus (P) and wheat yield, using the Australian Better Fertiliser Decisions for Crops database-the biggest dataset available for this relationship. Calibrations developed from this dataset have been criticised, and so we aimed to explore factors accounting for more of the variation in the relationships for the dryland, winter-dominant rainfall region of southern New South Wales. As reported previously, soil type was shown to influence the critical range and r-value for the Colwell P soil-test calibration for P responses by wheat. We also identified a tendency for dry conditions, at sowing or during the season, to lower relative yields for a given soil-test value, indicating increased reliance on fertiliser P over soil P. A similar trend was evident for later sowing date, again suggesting an increased probability of crop P requirements being met from the fertiliser P. However, additional records need to be generated to establish definitively that early sowing or subsurface P reserves minimise response to fertiliser P. In general, factors that influence crop access to soil P will have an impact on response to fertiliser P. Although this analysis shows that it is possible to 'tighten' the response curve for Colwell P and wheat by restricting the data for a given soil type to ideal management and seasonal conditions, the 'outliers' that are excluded frequently reflect an important subset of environmental conditions encountered by wheat crops in dryland agriculture.

Global ecosystem thresholds driven by aridity	SCIENCE												Aridity, which is increasing worldwide because of climate change, affects the structure and functioning of dryland ecosystems. Whether aridification leads to gradual (versus abrupt) and systemic (versus specific) ecosystem changes is largely unknown. We investigated how 20 structural and functional ecosystem attributes respond to aridity in global drylands. Aridification led to systemic and abrupt changes in multiple ecosystem attributes. These changes occurred sequentially in three phases characterized by abrupt decays in plant productivity, soil fertility, and plant cover and richness at aridity values of 0.54, 0.7, and 0.8, respectively. More than 20% of the terrestrial surface will cross one or several of these thresholds by 2100, which calls for immediate actions to minimize the negative impacts of aridification on essential ecosystem services for the more than 2 billion people living in drylands.

For centuries, large areas of floodplain wetlands in China have been extensively reclaimed for agricultural purposes due to population growth. However, little is known about the evolution of soil C:N:P stoichiometry along a reclamation chronosequence, particularly across different land uses. In this study, we investigated the variations in soil C:N:P ratios with land use and time gradients along a reclamation chronosequence comprising c. 0, 60, 100, 280, 2000, and 3000 years. Land reclamation induced nutrient decoupling, as it facilitated C and N accumulation from biological processes but restricted P supply controlled by geochemical processes. Soil C and N sequestration reached a stable state after 2000 years, while P declined steadily from 60 years. Soil C/P and N/P increased significantly and were controlled by organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN), respectively, indicating that an increase in C and N could also promote P uptake. Soil C/N declined in the first 60 years and stabilized at a threshold of 10:1. Different land use patterns following reclamation resulted in distinct soil nutrient structures. Paddies retained more OC and TN but exhibited lower adsorption of total phosphorus (TP) compared to adjacent dryland, leading to significant differences in C/P and N/P between land uses. Based on the redundancy analysis and random forest model, soil OC and TN were mainly affected by the abundance of bacteria metabolizing cellulose, while metal oxides, including Fe2O3 and CaO, could best predict TP. Soil C/P and N/P were mainly driven by soil texture and rose significantly with the increasing proportion of clay particles. Our study suggests that as reclamation proceeds, more anthropogenic management is required to regulate potential nutrient imbalances in order to prevent adverse effects on crop growth, soil quality, and ecosystem health. Additionally, any fertilization strategy should be developed based on dryland C and N deficiencies, and lack of P in paddies.

Disparate responses of soil-atmosphere CO<sub>2</sub> exchange to biophysical and geochemical factors over a biocrust ecological succession in the Tabernas Desert	GEODERMA												There is growing evidence that dryland soils could act as substantial but so far disregarded carbon sinks at the global scale. In drylands, potential abiotic processes of CO2 uptake are still debated while estimates of the biotic contribution of photosynthetizing biocrusts to the net carbon uptake remain uncertain. This uncertainty is partly attributable to a common neglect of the underlying soil and spatiotemporal variability of soil CO2 fluxes. Moreover, it is still unknown how those fluxes evolve during the ecological succession of biocrusts and which factors control them. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to (1) identify those factors and use them for predictions, and (2) explain the inter-annual variation of cumulative CO2 fluxes over the succession. We conducted 2 years of continuous measurements of the topsoil CO2 molar fraction (chi s) and microclimatic variables and estimated the soil-atmosphere CO2 flux using the gradient method. Statistical spatiotemporal models were developed of chi s dynamics and cumulative annual fluxes. A soil CO2 uptake potentially due to coupled gypsum dissolution-calcite precipitation was consistently detected at night, with cumulative values ranging from-4 to-65 gC m- 2 depending on succession stage. In comparison, cumulative soil CO2 emissions ranged from 101 to 307 gC m(-2) depending on succession stage. The succession stage, soil water content (theta w), and temperature (Ts) and the in-teractions of these variables explained and efficiently predicted the daily averaged chi s dynamics. Soil CO(2 )emissions were more sensitive to theta w and Ts in late successional stages, apparently because of organic carbon accumulation and higher porosity. Our measurements suggest that CO2 consumption processes were progressively counterbalanced by the increase in biological CO2 production during succession. That is probably why those processes could mainly be detected in early successional stages and more generally in drylands, as they sustain a low biological activity. However, such processes could be ubiquitous in ecosystems but difficult to detect. We discuss the implication of those results for the extensive dryland soils in the context of climate change.

Sedimentology and isotope geochemistry of transitional evaporitic environments within arid continental settings: From erg to saline lakes	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Arid continental basins typically contain a spectrum of coeval environments that coexist and interact from proximal to distal. Within the distal portion, aeolian ergs often border playa, or perennial, desert lakes, fed by fluvial incursions or elevated groundwaters. Evaporites are common features in these dryland, siliciclastic dominant settings. However, sedimentary controls upon evaporite deposition are not widely understood, especially within transitional zones between coeval clastic environments that are dominantly controlled by larger scale allocyclic processes, such as climate. The sulphur (delta S-34) and oxygen (delta O-18, Delta O-17) isotope systematics of evaporites can reveal cryptic aspects of sedimentary cycling and sulphate sources in dryland settings. However, due to the lack of sedimentological understanding of evaporitic systems, isotopic data can be easily misinterpreted. This work presents detailed sedimentological and petrographic observations, coupled with delta S-34, delta O-18 and Delta O-17 data, for the early Permian Cedar Mesa Sandstone Formation (western USA). Depositional models for mixed evaporitic/clastic sedimentation, which occurs either in erg-marginal or lacustrine-marginal settings, are presented to detail the sedimentary interactions present in terms of climate variations that control them. Sedimentological and petrographical analysis of the evaporites within the Cedar Mesa Sandstone Formation reveal a continental depositional environment and two end member depositional models have been developed: erg-margin and lake-margin. The delta S-34 values of gypsum deposits within the Cedar Mesa Sandstone Formation are consistent with late Carboniferous to early Permian marine settings. However, a marine interpretation is inconsistent with sedimentological and petrographic evidence. Consequently, delta S-34, delta O-18 and Delta O-17 values are probably recycled and do not reflect ocean-atmosphere values at the time of evaporite precipitation. They are most likely derived from the weathering of older marine evaporites in the hinterland.

We report the aggradation and incision phases along the Northern Hill Range (NHR), Kachchh; one of the most seismically active, but poorly explored, intraplate environments on earth. The northerly draining fluvial sequences in the NHR, exhibit a variety of valley fill, channel fill and strath terrace sequences over the hanging wall block of one the most seismically active reverse faults in the world similar to Kachchh Mainland Fault (KMF). The study of these sequences owing to its position, enables us to reconstruct the uplift history of the KMF as well as scrutinize the signatures of climatic and tectonic events in sedimentation since the last glacial period. Based on detailed stratigraphy and OSL chronology, we identified five cyclic phases of aggradation and incision during the last 24 ka period. The NHR experienced two aggradation phases during 24-10 ka and 8-4 ka period in response to climate change. Simultaneously, the KMF experienced at least two phases of uplift 1) > 24 ka and < 4 ka, which led to landscape modification at regional scale inform of terrace formation. Global events such as Early Holocene Optima and 4.2 ka arid phase are also archived in form of strong erosional phase in the fluvial sequences of NHR. Although due to paucity of archives and discreet nature of sedimentary succession in dryland environments, the actual causal mechanism for the incision at 4 ka period remains ambiguous. The longterm minimum average uplift rate of the eastern KMF varies from 0.1 to 1.0 mm/a, which is directly linked to the longterm deformation rate, often experienced in such intraplate setting. The study exemplifies the fluvial response, of transport deficit dryland environments, to external perturbations and their application in reconstructing palaeo extreme events.

Climate change effects on pasture-based dairy systems in south-eastern Australia	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE												Increases in temperature, along with possible decreases in rainfall, will influence the production of forage on Australian dairy farms. A biophysical simulation study was undertaken to compare the performance of perennial pastures and annual forage cropping systems under a historical scenario and two possible future climate scenarios for three key dairy locations of south-eastern Australia. Pastures and forage-cropping systems were simulated with the biophysical models DairyMod and APSIM, respectively, for a location with a heavy reliance on irrigation (Dookie, Victoria), a location with a partial reliance on irrigation (Elliott, Tasmania), and a dryland location (Terang, Victoria). The historical climate scenario (baseline scenario) had no augmentation to climate data and an atmospheric CO2 concentration of 380 ppm, whereas the two future climate scenarios had either a 1 degrees C increase in temperatures (with an atmospheric CO2 concentration of 435 ppm) and a concurrent 10% decrease in rainfall, or a 2 degrees C increase in temperatures (with an atmospheric CO2 concentration of 535 ppm) and a concurrent 20% decrease in rainfall. At Dookie, mean annual dry matter yields of the forage-cropping options and the pasture systems increased under both future climate scenarios but more irrigation was required. At Terang, the yield of forage-cropping systems increased whereas the yield of the pasture systems decreased under the future climate scenarios. At Elliott, yields of irrigated pastures and cropping systems increased but there was minimal or a negative impact on yields of dryland pastures and cropping systems under the future climate scenarios. At all three locations, forage production increased in the colder months of the year with a decrease in production during the warmer months. This study indicates that double-cropping and irrigated-pasture systems at all three locations appear resilient to projected changes in climate; however, for irrigated systems this assumes a reliable supply of irrigation water. The systems implications of how a shift in the seasonality of forage supply within these options impacts on the farm system as a whole warrants further investigation.					; Pembleton, Keith/C-2401-2014	Cullen, Brendan/0000-0003-2327-0946; Rawnsley, Richard/0000-0001-5381-0208; Pembleton, Keith/0000-0002-1896-4516													1836-0947	1836-5795					2021	72	8-9			SI		666	677		10.1071/CP20108	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/CP20108		SEP 2020											WOS:000571564600001

Agronomic and economic performance of organic forage, quinoa, and grain crop rotations in the Palouse region of the Pacific Northwest, USA	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												Volatile crop prices and a desire for sustainability have farmers considering alternative practices to increase revenue diversity and protect soil health. Organic management is rapidly expanding as an alternative to conventional agriculture, and quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) is a potential new crop for organic systems in the Pacific Northwest. Here we tested the agronomic and economic effects of diversifying dryland crop rotations with organic quinoa in the Palouse region of the Pacific Northwest. Eight 3-year grain cropping sequences were compared based on metrics of crop productivity, crop quality, and economic performance. While the crop sequences affected these metrics, crop yields and quality were mediated primarily by weather across growing seasons. Cumulative yields were higher for crop sequences that started with chickpea compared to barley. Organic quinoa yields were lower than the yield potential for the region, but some 3-year sequences with quinoa produced similar net returns to some sequences with wheat. Mean returns over variable costs were $324 ha(-1) yr(-1) for the 3-year sequence treatments; each treatment averaged positive net returns to variable costs despite some individual years having negative returns. The highest net returns to variable costs were in sequences that grew wheat and those that started with chickpea. Returns over total costs for the 3-year sequence treatments averaged -$33 ha(-1) yr(-1). The organic cropping systems (the total 8-year crop rotations including 5 years of organic alfalfa) produced higher returns over variable and total costs ($615 ha(-1) yr(-1) and $168 ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively) than a typical conventional rotation with county average yields during the same 8-year period ($477 ha(-1) yr(-1) and $82 ha(-1) yr(-1)). Our results show that premiums for organic alfalfa and grains make these organic cropping systems economically viable for dryland production in the Pacific Northwest. Advances in organic weed control and regionally adapted quinoa varieties would further reduce the risk for farmers attempting this cropping system diversification.

Phillip			Managing flood flow connectivity to landscapes to build buffering capacity to disturbances: An ecohydrologic modeling framework for drylands	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Increased flooding, droughts, and sediment transport are watershed-scale problems negatively impacting agriculture and ecosystems in drylands worldwide. Vegetation loss in upland watersheds is leading to scouring floods, which in turn decreases infiltration, soil moisture levels, and downstream groundwater recharge. Management to confront these intractable problems has been hindered by a lack of accessible decision support tools for both land and water managers that synthesize the watershed processes that buffer against dryland disturbances. Flood flow connectivities across the landscape create buffer zones through replenishing soil moisture and reducing flood energy, which in turn support multiple functions. This study developed a decision support tool, the Flood Flow Connectivity to the Landscape (FlowCon) framework that quantifies the most efficient management efforts to increase the key watershed buffering functions of increasing infiltration and reducing flow energy. FlowCon links three spatially explicit, process-based, and predictive models to answer two critical management questions: what key processes acting in what optimal areas are drivers of infiltration dynamics and what roles do peak flows of differing scales of energy play. The spatial models delineated the buffer zone to characterize the heterogeneous and optimal infiltration dynamics across the landscape. The hydrologic process model, using a curve number technique, identified the key ecohydrologic processes that affect infiltration and characterized peak flows and flow regime variability. The predictive flood routing model quantified the potential management benefits. We calibrated the models with measured runoff and the corresponding rainfall events for a six-year period, which included thirty-six flow events. The synthesized ecohydrologic indicators provided critical calibrations, improving the relationship between the hydrologic modeling results and observed data by 12% for the linear regression R-2 and 69% for the root mean square error (RMSE). Implementation of prioritized management is estimated to reduce peak flow by half, with interventions focused on 24% of floodplains that infiltrate three times the flow volume per area than the floodplain average. FlowCon provides an efficient assessment framework that integrates watershed process understanding in an accessible decision support tool to achieve tangible improvements in dryland watershed management.

Our purpose was to evaluate and compare the effects of four different re-warm-up strategies, i.e. rest in normoxia (RN) at FiO(2) = 20.9%, rest in hypoxia (RH) at FiO(2) = 15%, active (5 minutes dryland-based exercise circuit) in normoxia (AN) and active in hypoxia (AH), during the transitional phase, on subsequent 100 m maximal swimming performance. Thirteen competitive swimmers (n = 7 males; n = 6 females; age: 15.1 +/- 2.1 years; height: 164.7 +/- 8.8 cm; weight: 58.1 +/- 9.7 kg; 100 m season's best time 72.0 +/- 11.8 s) completed a 20-minute standardized in-water warm-up followed by a 30-minute randomized transitional phase and 100 m freestyle time trial. Compared to AR (73.4 +/- 6.2 s), 100 m swim time trials were significantly (p = 0.002; eta(2) = 0.766) slower in RN (75.7 +/- 6.7 s; p = 0.01), AN (75.2 +/- 6.7 s; p = 0.038) and RH (75.0 +/- 6.4 s; p = 0.009). Moreover, compared to AH (36.3 +/- 0.4 degrees C), tympanic temperature was significantly lower (p<0.001; eta(2) = 0.828) at the end of the transitional phase in passive conditions (RN: 35.9 +/- 0.6; p = 0.032; RH: 36.0 +/- 0.4; p = 0.05). In addition, countermovement jump height at the end of the transitional phase was significantly higher in active than in passive conditions (p = 0.001; eta(2) = 0.728). A dryland-based circuit under hypoxia could be useful to swimmers, once it has attenuated the decline in tympanic temperature during a 30-minute transitional phase after warm-up, improving 100 m swimming performance in young amateur swimmers.

A comparison of near-surface potential temperature variance budgets for unstable atmospheric flows with contrasting vegetation cover flat surfaces and a gentle slope	ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS												Over the past decades, researchers have made significant progress toward a fundamental understanding of the budgets of turbulence variables over flat and homogeneous terrain, and only more recently over complex terrain. However, temperature variance budgets, which are parameterized in most meteorological models, are still poorly understood even under relatively idealized conditions. The objective of this study is to analyze the near-surface potential temperature variance budget over contrasting surfaces. To do this, we rely on profiles of near-surface turbulence variables collected as part of the Mountain Terrain Atmospheric Modeling and Observations program. Daytime observations collected in May 2013 in western Utah at three field sites subjected to similar large-scale forcing are analyzed: a desert playa (i.e., dry lakebed), characterized by a flat surface devoid of vegetation; a vegetated site, characterized by a flat valley floor covered with greasewood vegetation, and a slope site with a local slope angle of 2 degrees-4 degrees and covered by 1-m tall sparse desert steppe vegetation. The observations indicate a persistent 5-m surface layer across all three sites, where the flow is equilibrium due to the balance between dominant production and dissipation terms in the potential temperature variance equation. The temperature variances in this layer are well predicted by Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. During convective periods at the Playa and Slope sites, approximate to 60% of the data show a ratio of turbulent transport to production greater than 0.1. Within the surface layer, turbulent transport of potential temperature variance acts as a sink term at all three sites. Neither the ratio of turbulent transport to production nor the ratio of production to dissipation show a dependence on atmospheric stability during the unstable periods studied. A short-period comparison of dissipation rates calculated using dissipation-scale resolving cold-wire anemometry and several common indirect methods using sonic anemometry is presented for data acquired at Playa site. The results indicate that the dissipation rates from all methods follow similar trends, however the values can differ by a factor of 2-3.

Two experiments were established in the Loess Plateau of China to measure yield and its components, evapotranspiration, water-use efficiency (yield per unit evapotranspiration), accumulation and apparent remobilisation of stem water soluble carbohydrates (WSC), and economic benefit of dual-purpose winter wheat. Experiment 1 combined factorially three defoliation treatments, i.e. winter defoliation (DC23), spring defoliation (DC29) and untreated control, two seeding rates (currently recommended, and 125% recommended), and over four seasons. Experiment 2 combined factorially two defoliation treatments (spring defoliation and control), two nitrogen rates (low: 120-150 kg N ha(-1), high: 180-200 kg N ha(-1)), three levels of soil water at sowing (low: rainfed; medium: rain + 67 mm; high: rain +133 mm), and over three seasons. Defoliation was largely neutral for grain yield and water-use efficiency, and improved translocation of WSC to grain by 8%, harvest index by 7% and net income by 15% across conditions. Grain yield was unaffected by the interaction between defoliation and seeding rate, but significantly impacted by interactions of defoliation x initial soil water level and defoliation x nitrogen rate. Defoliated wheat yield was greater at high than at medium and low initial soil water content, and at low than at high nitrogen rate. Spring defoliation produced similar yield as winter defoliation but the former increased forage income. Increasing seeding rate or nitrogen rate increased forage income but reduced net income due to lower grain income and higher cost. Thus, dualpurpose winter wheat was more profitable (i) when defoliated in spring, (ii) at the lower seeding density, (iii) under the lower nitrogen rate, and (iv) with higher soil water content at sowing. Apparent translocation of stem WSC partially mediated the effect of defoliation on grain yield. It is concluded that dual-purpose winter wheat is feasible under straw mulching in semiarid environment.					王, 娅冰/JGE-0541-2023; sun, jiamin/JPY-2155-2023; Sadras, Victor/D-5122-2013	Sadras, Victor/0000-0002-5874-6775; Hu, Changlu/0000-0003-4106-3916													0378-4290	1872-6852				SEP 1	2019	241								107579	10.1016/j.fcr.2019.107579	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2019.107579													WOS:000484872000021

Therefore, increasing the resilience of these smallholders is vital for their prosperity. This study quantified household resilience and identified livelihoods and their influence on resilience in the semiarid tropics of India by analysing 684 households. A resilience capacity index was devised based on the composition of household food and non-food expenditure, cash savings, and food and feed reserves. The index ranged from 8.4 reflecting highly resilient households with access to irrigation characteristics, to -3.7 for households with highly limited resilience and low household assets. The livelihoods were identified through multivariate analysis on selected socioeconomic and biophysical variables; households were heterogeneous in their livelihoods. Irrigated livestock and rainfed marginal types had the highest and lowest resilience capacity index with the mean score of 0.69 and -1.07, respectively. Finally, we quantified the influence of livelihood strategies on household resilience. Household resilience was strengthened by the possession of livestock, crop diversification and access to irrigation. Low resilience is predominantly caused by low household assets. The resilience capacity index and derived livelihood strategies helps to understand the complexity of household resilience, and will aid in targeting technology interventions for development.

To understand variation in gene regulatory networks activated by submergence, we conducted a high-resolution analysis of chromatin accessibility and gene expression at three scales of transcript control in four angiosperms, ranging from a dryland-adapted wild species to a wetland crop. The data define a cohort of conserved submergence-activated genes with signatures of overlapping cis regulation by four transcription factor families. Syntenic genes are more highly expressed than nonsyntenic genes, yet both can have the cis motifs and chromatin accessibility associated with submergence up-regulation. Whereas the flexible circuitry spans the eudicot-monocot divide, the frequency of specific cis motifs, extent of chromatin accessibility, and degree of submergence activation are more prevalent in the wetland crop and may have adaptive importance.

This study performed a comprehensive data quality test, a precipitation concentration index (PCI), Sen's slope, Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test, and an analysis of the symptoms of drought using rainfall anomaly index (RAI) and standardized precipitation index (SPI). The standard homogeneity test (SNHT), Pettitt test, Buishand range test, and von Neumann scale were used for homogeneity analysis, and most tehsils (administrative boundary) showed the same weather character. PCI annual estimates show high local and temporary variability or irregularity in rainfall distribution. MK tests showed a marked increase in the tendency to high temperatures; however, the trend of annual and extreme rain events was not significant for most of the stations. The extreme dry conditions in 101 years (IMD) were found at Sujangarh. Analysis of size statistics and the trend of rainfall anomaly indices and spatial variability of climate data are important in the integration of water resource planning and management decisions. Rajasthan is an agricultural state in India, the monsoon rainfall largely controls the production of crops, and the proper implementation of regional agro-water management and rainwater harvesting can contribute significantly to agricultural potential. This study paves the way for further exploration of inter-regional hydrological modeling to sustain livelihoods. The mean yearly precipitation has shown a minimal non-significant positive pattern over the dryland ecosystem. Amazingly, 3 year running average has shown a cyclic example of mean yearly precipitation under the changing climatic conditions and in dry and wet conditions at different time scales. The western, northern, and southern parts of the dryland ecosystem have encountered wetter conditions (significant at 95% certainty level), while north-eastern, eastern, and south-eastern regions have seen expanded drier circumstances. Overall, most of the areas are suffering from hyperarid conditions, which needs extreme water management for a below normal-to-normal arid cropping.

However, there remains highly un-certain in terms of water use and carbon sequestration for artificial plantation in desert. Here, continuous water and carbon fluxes were measured using eddy covariance (EC) in conjunction with hydrometeorological mea-surements over an artificial C4 shrub, Haloxylon ammodendron (C. A. Mey.) Bunge, from July 2020 to 2021 in Tengger Desert, China. Throughout 2021, evapotranspiration (ET) was 189.5 mm, of which 85% (150 mm) occurred during growing season, that was comparable with the summation of precipitation (132.2 mm), dew (33.5 mm) and potential other sources (e.g. deep subsoil water). This ecosystem was a strong carbon sink with net ecosystem production (NEP) up to 446.4 g C m- 2 yr -1, much higher than surrounding sites. Gross primary production (GPP, 598.7 g C m- 2 yr -1) in this shrubland was comparable with that of other shrublands, whereas ecosystem respiration (Re, 152.3 g C m- 2 yr -1) was lower. Random Forest showed that environmental factors can explain 71.56% and 80.07% variation of GPP and ET, respectively. Interestingly, environmental factors have divergent effect on water and carbon exchange, i.e., soil hydrothermic factors (soil moisture content and soil temperature) determine the magnitude and seasonal pattern of ET and Re, while aerodynamics factors (net radiation, atmospheric temperature and wind speed) determine GPP and NEP. As such, divergent response of abiotic factors resulted in the decoupling of water and carbon exchange. Our results suggest that H. ammodendron is a suitable species for large-scale afforestation in dryland given its low water use but high carbon sequestration. Therefore, we infer that artificial planting H. ammodendron in dryland could provide an opportunity for climate change mitigation, and the long-term time series data is needed to confirm its sustainable role of carbon sequestration in the future.																			0301-4797	1095-8630				OCT 15	2023	344								118416	10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118416	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118416		JUN 2023						37331315					WOS:001028901500001

This paper examined Anhui Province, China, through topo-graphic data, climate data, human activity data, and land use data from 2000, 2010, and 2020. To reveal the habitat quality impact mechanisms, the paper assessed the province's spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of habitat quality by the Patch-generating Land Use Simulation (PLUS) model, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (INVEST) model, and geo-graphic probe model. The results showed that: 1) From 2000 to 2020, Paddy field, Dryland, and Wooded land covered 70% of the study area. From 2000 to 2020, the integrated land use dynamic attitude was 0.51%, with active changes in the Paddy field, Dryland, and open Wooded land and a continuous increase in dynamic attitude. Compared to 2020, the spatial distribution characteristics of land use types in 2030 remain largely unchanged. However, Paddy fields and Drylands still show an increasing trend, while Wooded land, Reservoir ponds, and Urban land demonstrate a small decreasing trend. All other land types remain unchanged; 2) Secondly, between 2000 and 2020, habitat quality gradually decreased, while the percentage of poor habitat quality increased by 1.47% and the percentage of worse habitat quality decreased by -1.41%. All other classes exhibited a small decreasing trend; the mean habitat quality decreased by 0.01 compared to 2020 in 2030, and was mainly distributed in the southwestern and eastern edges of the province; and 3) DEM, aspect, precipitation, and evapotranspiration have a high explanatory power for habitat quality, while the variable Places has significantly increased its explanatory power for habitat quality between 2010 and 2020. Natural factors laid down the graded distribution pattern of habitat quality, and the location and intensity of human activities drove the evolution of habitat quality. Analyzing the mechanism behind habitat quality in Anhui Province provides a theoretical basis for ecological restoration and ecological planning.																				2296-665X				APR 14	2023	11								1145626	10.3389/fenvs.2023.1145626	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1145626													WOS:000978907400001
J	Fang, Z; Yu, HL; Li, CH; Wang, B; Huang, JY				Fang, Zhao; Yu, Hailong; Li, Chunhuan; Wang, Bin; Huang, Juying			Soil microbial biomass C:N:P stoichiometry is driven more by climate, soil properties and plant traits than by N enrichment in a desert steppe	CATENA												The impacts of increased ecosystem nitrogen (N) inputs on soil microbial biomass C:N:P stoichiometry have been extensively explored. However, the stoichiometric homeostasis and driving mechanisms of microbial C:N:P stoichiometry following N enrichment remain elusive in dryland ecosystems, especially in moderately alkaline desert steppes. Here, we employed a five-year (2015-2019) N enrichment experiment to examine the changes in microbial C:N:P stoichiometry and the strength of stoichiometric homeostasis in a moderately alkaline desert steppe in northwest China. Climate factors, plant traits, and soil properties were analyzed to determine the critical factors influencing microbial C:N:P stoichiometry. The results showed that microbial C:N:P stoichiometry changed little under low doses of N input (<10 g m(-2) yr(-1)), and only microbial biomass C increased significantly by 35.89%-51.26% at 1.25 and 2.50 g m(-2) yr(-1). In contrast, a high N enrichment rate (20 g m(-)(2) yr(-1)) significantly enhanced the microbial biomass N (average 61.88%) and N:P (44.55%) but decreased the microbial biomass C:N (37.25%). However, microbial biomass P and C:P showed no significant changes under N enrichment. Significant interannual differences were observed in microbial C:N:P stoichiometry, whereas the effects of the interaction of N enrichment and year were not significant (except for microbial biomass C and C:P). With increasing N enrichment, microbes basically maintained strong elemental homeostasis. Moreover, we found that climate factors (explaining about 16% of the variation), soil properties (13%) and plant traits (4%) played critical roles in shaping microbial C:N:P stoichiometry. N enrichment represented only - 3% of the variation and thus had a weaker effect on microbial C:N:P stoichiometry. Altogether, our findings suggest that soil microbial C:N:P stoichiometry is more likely driven by climate factors, soil properties, and plant traits than by N enrichment in dryland ecosystems.					方, 昭/Q-1197-2016	方, 昭/0000-0001-9276-3096													0341-8162	1872-6887				SEP	2022	216		B						106402	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106402	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106402		MAY 2022											WOS:000832992600002
J	Wang, H; Yu, S; Wang, G				Wang, Hui; Yu, Song; Wang, Gang			STUDY ON DISTRIBUTION CHARACTERISTICS OF HEAVY METAL ELEMENTS IN SOIL AND CROP IN HEAVY METAL MINING AREAS	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												Soil heavy metal pollution has become an important environmental pollution problem that plagues most countries and regions in the world today. Black shale is considered as a potential source of heavy metal contamination of soil. In this paper, taking heavy metal mining areas in southern China as an example, the characteristics of heavy metal elements in soil and crops and the degree of heavy metal pollution in soil were systematically studied, and then a strategy for remediation and safe utilization of heavy metal-contaminated farmland soil was formulated. The results showed that the contents of heavy metal elements in different types of soils in the study area were higher than the background values of the corresponding soil elements. The crops grown in the soil of the mining area all exceed the standard, and the heavy metal that exceeds the standard is Ni. The pollution index comparison results showed that the average pollution index of Mo element in dryland soil, paddy soil and forest soil in the study area was the highest, and the pollution degree of Mo element in dryland soil was the highest. The heavy metal content of the soil in the polluted area is seriously polluted, and it is difficult for crops to grow. Therefore, the original planting structure can be adjusted, and the original planting of food crops can be changed to economic crops such as mulberry trees. By planting the mulberry and sericulture industry chain, the heavy metals in farmland can be prevented from being absorbed into the food chain through the roots of plants, so as to achieve the purpose of safe utilization. In addition, in order to prevent heavy metal elements from entering the food chain and endangering human health in heavily polluted areas, a plan should be reasonably formulated to adjust the planting structure of cultivated land or to return farmland to forests and grasslands.

This sensor transmits and receives ultrawideband (1 to 6 GHz) radio waves between two separated antennas and measures the propagation delay time in the soil related to the dielectric constant. This method is expected to be less affected by air gaps between the probes and the soil, as well as being less affected by soil electrical conductivity (EC), than typical commercial sensors. The relationship between output and volumetric water content (theta), and the effects of air gaps and EC were evaluated through experiments using sand samples and the prototype SFDT sensor. The output of the SFDT sensor increased linearly with theta and was not affected by even a high salt concentration for irrigation water, such that the EC of the pore water was 9.2 dS.m(-1). The SFDT sensor was almost unaffected by polyethylene tapes wrapped around the sensor to simulate air gaps, whereas a commercially available capacitance sensor significantly underestimated theta. Theoretical models of the SFDT sensor were also developed for the calibration equation and the air gaps. The calculation results agreed well with the experimental results, indicating that analytical approaches are possible for the evaluation of the SFDT sensor.																				1424-8220				NOV	2022	22	22							8658	10.3390/s22228658	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22228658								36433254					WOS:000887809600001
J	Kindermann, L; Dobler, M; Niedeggen, D; Linstädter, A				Kindermann, Liana; Dobler, Magnus; Niedeggen, Daniela; Linstadter, Anja			A new protocol for estimation of woody aboveground biomass in disturbance-prone ecosystems	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Almost one third of global drylands are open forests and savannas, which are typically shaped by frequent natural disturbances such as wildfire and herbivory. Studies on ecosystem functions and services of woody vegetation require robust estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB). However, most methods have been developed for comparatively undisturbed forest ecosystems. As they are not tailored to accurately quantify AGB of small and irregular growth forms, their application on these growth forms may lead to unreliable or even biased AGB estimates in disturbance-prone dryland ecosystems. Moreover, these methods cannot quantify AGB losses caused by disturbance agents. Here we propose a methodology to estimate individual-and stand-level woody AGB in disturbance-prone ecosystems. It consists of flexible field sampling routines and estimation workflows for six growth classes, delineated by size and damage criteria. It also comprises a detailed damage assessment, harnessing the ecological archive of woody growth for past disturbances. Based on large inventories collected along steep gradients of elephant disturbances in African dryland ecosystems, we compared the AGB estimates generated with our proposed method against estimates from a less adapted forest inventory method. We evaluated the necessary stepwise procedures of method adaptation and analyzed each step's effect on stand-level AGB estimation. We further explored additional advantages of our proposed method with regard to disturbance impact quantification. Results indicate that a majority of growth forms and individuals in savanna vegetation could only be assessed if methods of AGB estimation were adapted to the conditions of a disturbance-prone ecosystem. Furthermore, our damage assessment demonstrated that one third to half of all woody AGB was lost to disturbances. Consequently, less adapted methods may be insufficient and are likely to render inaccurate AGB estimations. Our proposed method has the potential to accurately quantify woody AGB in disturbance-prone ecosystems, as well as AGB losses. Our method is more time consuming than conventional allometric approaches, yet it can cover sufficient areas within reasonable timespans, and can also be easily adapted to alternative sampling schemes.

Understanding the diversity in yield potential and stability among commercial sorghum hybrids can inform crop designs	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Reducing yield gaps in dryland cropping depends on our capacity to identify combinations of genetics (G) and management (M) (i.e. crop designs, G x M) that best suit site and seasonal conditions (the environment, E). We combined empirical and modelling approaches to characterise and explain the yield stability and yield potential of commercial sorghum hybrids when grown under a range of agronomic managements and environments yielding between 3 and 12 t ha(-1). The empirical data includes two seasons (2014-15 and 2015-2016) of on-farm and on-research station trials conducted across six sites in Queensland, Australia. Agronomic management treatments included plant density, row configuration, level of irrigation and fertiliser inputs, and time of sowing. Six hybrids contrasting in maturity and tillering type were characterised relative to the industry standard MR-Buster in terms of yield potential, yield stability (b(i)), and an expected utility index that combines both indices. A medium-late maturity and high tillering hybrid (MR-Scorpio), had the highest utility rank and showed high b(i) values due to high tiller productivity. A variety of significant row spacing and configuration, and plant density effects on yield were observed, but these were inconsistent across sites and seasons. A long-term simulation experiment across contrasting environments was used to identify hybrid traits and managements capable of modifying yield stability. Combined with the empirical data, the simulations suggest hybrids showing high biomass production and multiple productive tillers can increase the response of yield to the productivity of the environment, whereas reducing the thermal time to floral initiation may increase the stability of yields across environments. Expected changes in hybrid rank due to such G x E interactions, along with the complex effects of management on yield, increase the need to match crop design to specific sites and seasons. The value of targeted crop design depends on the diversity of traits among commercial hybrids and the availability of a skilful seasonal climate forecast to allow farmers to match hybrids and management to prevailing and expected seasonal conditions.

In this paper, erosion, flood risk, and greenhouse gas sequestration resulting from sea-level rise in the coastal zone of the Benin coast were assessed with the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) using ArcGIS Pro 3.1 tools. The input features used were the Digital Elevation Map (DEM), the National Wetland Inventory (NWI) categories, and the slope of each cell. National Wetland Inventory (NWI) categories were then created using Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a supervised machine learning technique. The research simulated the effects of a 1.468 m sea-level rise in the study area from 2021 to 2090, considering wetland types, marsh accretion, wave erosion, and surface elevation changes. The largest land cover increases were observed in Estuarine Open Water and Open Ocean, expanding by approximately 106.2 hectares across different sea-level rise scenarios (RCP 8.5_Upper Limit). These gains were counterbalanced by losses of approximately 106.2 hectares in Inland Open Water, Ocean Beaches, Mangroves, Regularly Flooded Marsh, Swamp, Undeveloped, and Developed Dryland. Notably, Estuarine Open Water (97.7 hectares) and Open Ocean (8.5 hectares) experienced the most significant expansion, indicating submergence and saltwater intrusion by 2090 due to sea-level rise. The largest reductions occurred in less tidally influenced categories like Inland Open Water (-81.4 hectares), Ocean Beach (-7.9 hectares), Swamp (-5.1 hectares), Regularly Flooded Marsh (-4.6 hectares), and Undeveloped Dryland (-2.9 hectares). As the sea-level rises by 1.468 m, these categories are expected to be notably diminished, with Estuarine Open Water and Open Ocean becoming dominant. Erosion and flooding in the coastal zone are projected to have severe adverse impacts, including a gradual decline in greenhouse gas sequestration capacity. The outputs of this research will aid coastal management organizations in evaluating the consequences of sea-level rise and identifying areas with high mitigation requirements.

Identifying spatio-seasonal variations, drivers and sources of NO3- in groundwater is key to controlling this pollution. In this study, we monitored 175 wells in areas with different irrigation practices (dryland, well irrigation and canal irrigation) in an intensive apple-planting region over a year (September 2020-October 2021) in the southern Loess Plateau, China. The integration of hydrochemical analysis, deep soil profiles, NO3- isotopic composition and a Bayesian isotope mixing model (SIAR) was used to identify the hotspots and hot moments of groundwater NO3- pollution, and main NO3- sources. The results showed that average NO3- concentrations of three regions gradually decreased from north to south, following the order of dryland region (9 mg NO3 L-1) < well irrigation region (23 mg NO3 L-1) < canal irrigation region (94 mg NO3 L-1), and orchard > residential area & AP;cereal land. In the study region, 44% of groundwater exceeded the drinking standard of the World Health Organization (50 mg NO3 L-1). The intensive apple planting in the canal irrigation regions has caused groundwater NO3- pollution, and changed hydrochemical types from HCO3- Ca & BULL;Mg to SO4 & BULL;Cl & BULL;NO3-Ca & BULL;Mg. In the canal irrigation region, NO3- in the vadose zone has migrated to groundwater. The hotspots of groundwater NO3- pollution (NO3- vulnerable zones) were identified at low-altitude loess tableland and alluvial plains with canal irrigation. Irrigation and precipitation accelerated soil NO3- deep migration. The hot moments of NO3- pollution in the irrigated region was the period from the wet season to the dry season; and the "hidden reactive N pool" in the deep vadose zone (>2 m) caused a time lag of NO3- reaching into groundwater. Chemical N fertilizer and manure N applied in apple orchards were the main contributing sources of groundwater NO3- pollution in the apple-planting region. Our study highlights the significant effect of apple-planting industry development on groundwater quality.

Estimating the variability for grain nutrients in diverse germplasm is important for developing biofortified cultivars. A finger millet diversity panel consisting of 310 accessions and four controls was evaluated in two rainy seasons at International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, Hyderabad, India, to assess variability for grain nutrient content and its association with agronomic traits and identify promising accessions. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission electrometry was used to analyze grain nutrients content, and the protein content was estimated from the total nitrogen content of the finger millet grains using the sulfuric acid-selenium digestion method. Highly significant variability was found for all the grain nutrients and was significantly influenced by the genotype, environment, and their interactions. Grain nutrients showed a significant relationship between the 2 years (R2 = 0.06 for phosphorus to 0.60 for Ca, p & GE; 0.001). A nonsignificant correlation between grain yield and Ca was noticed among accessions within landraces, breeding lines, and accessions from Asia, while this correlation was significantly negative among accessions from Africa and in the entire set. The estimated percent daily values indicated that the consumption of 100 g of finger millet grains could potentially contribute to the recommended dietary allowance of up to 49% Ca, 52% magnesium, 23% protein, 23% iron, and 26% zinc. This study provides valuable insights into the variability in the finger millet germplasm, and identified grain nutrient dense accessions, that could be used in finger millet improvement to develop the biofortified cultivars. Finger millet is a highly versatile dryland crop renowned for its remarkable calcium content.The study highlights significant variability in the grain nutrients content of finger millet germplasm.The promising nutrients dense accessions identified are a valuable resource for finger millet improvement.Consuming 100 g of finger millet grains could potentially contribute up to 49% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance of calcium.

Fonio millet genome unlocks African orphan crop diversity for agriculture in a changing climate	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Sustainable food production in the context of climate change necessitates diversification of agriculture and a more efficient utilization of plant genetic resources. Fonio millet (Digitaria exilis) is an orphan African cereal crop with a great potential for dryland agriculture. Here, we establish high-quality genomic resources to facilitate fonio improvement through molecular breeding. These include a chromosome-scale reference assembly and deep re-sequencing of 183 cultivated and wild Digitaria accessions, enabling insights into genetic diversity, population structure, and domestication. Fonio diversity is shaped by climatic, geographic, and ethnolinguistic factors. Two genes associated with seed size and shattering showed signatures of selection. Most known domestication genes from other cereal models however have not experienced strong selection in fonio, providing direct targets to rapidly improve this crop for agriculture in hot and dry environments.

This study aimed at evaluating the optimum stand densities (OSDs) of 10 recently released maize varieties under different crop management decisions and environments. Ten maize varieties of varying characteristics were planted in the Northern Guinea Savanna of Nigeria across 30 farmer's fields in the rainy seasons of 2016 and 2017 under three stand densities: 2.6, 5.3, and 6.6 plants m(-2). Grain yield and yield components were greatest under the high density in both years across all locations. The intermediate maturing varieties produced higher grain yields compared to the early and late maturing varieties in both years and locations. The environmental indices from the Factor Analytic Model showed 20% of the fields were optimal, 28.3% moderate, 31.7% poor, and 20% were very poor environments. Increasing planting density did not significantly affect the grain yield of the varieties in very poor environments. A linear increase in grain yield was observed in moderate and optimum environments with every increase in stand density for all varieties except Sammaz 32, however, optimum planting densities could not be reached for all the varieties. Therefore, tropical maize varieties should be planted under specific densities that account for environmental and management conditions to maximize yield.

While the nurse's impacts in biodiversity are documented, we know little about such impacts of different nurse's life forms; and how these impacts associate to climatic gradients. In this regard, we re-analyzed a dataset of 72 dryland sites, established across climatic gradients in 10 countries, and assessed changes of plant taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity with respect to presence of nurse plants from different plant life forms (i.e., grasses, shrubs and trees) and their absences (i.e., open communities). We observed a more substantial increase in functional and phylogenetic diversity associated to nurse grasses communities than their open pairs, with greater functional and phylogenetic dissimilarity between the communities under moderate climatic gradients. Such findings were consistent with an increase in the strength of correlations between these biodiversity facets. In communities including nurse shrubs, taxonomic and functional diversity were positively changed especially at the middle of climatic conditions, with stronger dissimilarities and relationships for taxonomic than for functional diversity. In contrast, nurse trees promoted negative impacts on all biodiversity facets under moderate climatic conditions, while the contrary pattern (except in functional diversity) was observed in their paired open communities, showing an increase with strength of correlations between biodiversity facets. Therefore, our results suggested different facilitatory mechanisms of nurse plants depending on their life forms to affect plant biodiversity. Such specific mechanisms might partly be explained by controlling beneficiary relatedness that may be significantly related to climatic conditions.

In modern Israel, remnants of this agricultural adaptation strategy are widespread mostly in the semi-arid and arid Negev. Extensive literature has thoroughly described the farming systems of this region. However, runoff agriculture in the dryer, hyper-arid regions of the Arava Valley and southern Negev (excluding the Uvda Valley), has scarcely been researched. A recent study revealed remnants of simple stone terraces in several wadis (ephemeral stream channels) throughout the central Arava Valley that have not yet been dated. The objective of this study was to use the Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) method to date sediments trapped in the stone terraces. The results revealed dominance of terraces dated to the Ottoman period (1516-1917 CE). Few samples were dated to the earlier Late Islamic period (1099-1516 CE) or Byzantine period (324-638 CE), and to the later, modern period of the mid-20th century. Generally, these periods coincide with relatively moister regional climatic conditions, which prevailed in the 4th, 11th-12th, and late 19th centuries CE. Yet, our findings also concur with periods of effective governance by central administrations. Therefore, results of this study fit the concept that runoff agriculture practiced in peripheral areas in ancient to recent-past times was co-determined by climatic settings and geo-political conditions, which enabled human inhabitation in these regions.

C.			Multiple abiotic and biotic drivers of long-term wood decomposition within and among species in the semi-arid inland dunes: A dual role for stem diameter	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												Litter decomposition in sunny, semi-arid and arid ecosystems is controlled by both biotic factors including litter traits and abiotic factors including UV light, but for wood decomposition it still remains uncertain which of these environmental factors are the predominant controls among different woody species. In these dry ecosystems, it is likely that the stem diameter and spatial position of the dead wood are of particular importance especially where wood can be buried versus exposed due to substrate displacement by wind. Here we focus on the fact that stem diameter can affect decomposition rates both via the relative surface exposure to sunlight or soil and via higher resource quality of narrower stems to decomposers. In a field manipulation experiment, we investigated the relative importance of litter position (sand burial vs. surface vs. suspended above the surface), UV radiation (block versus pass) and stem diameter class (<2, 2-4, 4-8, 8-13 and 13-20 mm) on the mass loss of woody litters of four shrub species in an inland dune ecosystem in northern China. We found that after 34 months of in situ incubation, the mass loss of buried woody litters was three times faster than those of suspended and surface woody litters (53.5 +/- 2.7%, 17.0 +/- 1.0% and 14.4 +/- 1.2%, respectively). In surface and suspended positions, litter decomposition rates were almost equally low and most mass loss was during the first 2 years, when bark was still attached and UV radiation had no significant effect on woody litter mass loss. These findings suggest that sand burial is the main environmental driver of wood decomposition via its control on microbial activity. Moreover, wood N and diameter class were the predominant factors driving woody litter decomposition. A key finding was that wider stems had slower litter decomposition rates not only directly (presumably via greater relative surface exposure) but also indirectly via their higher wood dry matter content or lower wood N; these effects were modulated by litter position. Our findings highlight a dual role of stem diameter on wood decomposition, that is, via relative surface exposure and via wood traits. The accuracy and confidence of global carbon cycling models would be improved by incorporating the different effects of stem diameter on woody litter decomposition and below-ground wood decomposition processes in drylands.

Moench) accessions	GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION												Forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is a C4 cereal crop with excellent quality, which is widely cultivated in many countries and regions. Acid detergent fiber is widely found in the stem and leaf tissues of plant, which is the main substance affecting the digestibility of livestock. It has a very important impact on the milk yield and quality of cows, dairy sheep and pigs. In order to further understand its genetic mechanism, we re-sequenced 206 forage sorghum germplasms from different regions of the world and identified 14,570,430 SNPs and 1,967,033 indels. Based on SNP markers, we analyzed the population genetic structure and identified the gene loci related to acid detergent fiber content by genome-wide association analysis (GWAS). Genetic relationship between materials showed that Asian and American sorghum varieties, breeding lines and improved varieties were more diverse, while European varieties were relatively more closely related. These findings provide new clues and directions for further study. GWAS revealed that 8 QTLs harboring 91 genes were found to be associated with acid detergent fiber content. These genes were significantly enriched into 6 major genes involved in cell membrane material transport or enzymes, showing a regional distribution. The findings provide a basis for us to understand the origin and spread of haplotypes related to acid detergent fiber content. The findings will accelerate the study of genetic gain of acid detergent fiber content and help breeders to improve feed quality and stress tolerance of forage sorghum.																			0925-9864	1573-5109				JUN	2022	69	5					1941	1951		10.1007/s10722-022-01355-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-022-01355-0		FEB 2022											WOS:000761872400001

Two main hydrographic streams cross the TCBR, the Salado River (an endogenous river) and the Grande River (an exogenous river). This study investigated temperature anomalies over the past 40 years. We analyzed potential differences between sub-basins and riparian areas on both streams using various indices, namely the Global Warming Index (GWI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDDI), and analyzed the potential relationship of these indices with climate change. Time series of satellite-based precipitation (June 2000-December 2020) and air temperature (January 1980-December 2020) were analyzed. A set of Landsat 8 OLI TIRS imagery from the driest and wettest months (2013-2020) was used to estimate NDVI, NDWI, and NDDI. These indices were evaluated separately for the sub-basins and river corridors in the dry and rainy seasons. The precipitation records indicate that in the Grande river sub-basin, precipitation is higher than in the Salado river sub basin. Normalized temperature anomalies and the GWI suggest a warming trend from 1994 to 2020, increasing up to 0.86 degrees C in the Salado River and 0.52 degrees C in the Grande River. The Grande and Salado sub basins showed significant differences between dry and wet seasons for each index (NDVI, NDWI, and NDDI). A Discriminant Analysis showed that the Salado sub-basin and the Salado River corridor are associated with severe drying conditions in the dry season (highest NDDI values). In the wet season, the Grande River corridor showed intermediate values of NDVI and NDWI but low values of NDDI. The Grande River corridor in the dry season was characterized by intermediate values of NDVI, NDWI, and NDDI. These river corridors provide environmental services in a trade-off with the stream and should be considered biodiversity hotspots. Due to the accentuated warming trend and the lowest precipitation, the Salado River sub-basin showed desertification signs associated with climate change. Both the Salado and the Grande River corridors showed resilience strategies to face climatic conditions.</p>					Sedeño-Díaz, Jacinto Elías/A-1257-2008	Sedeño-Díaz, Jacinto Elías/0000-0003-0008-2969; Lopez-Lopez, Eugenia/0000-0003-2696-533X														2296-665X				SEP 3	2021	9								681703	10.3389/fenvs.2021.681703	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.681703													WOS:000696844600001

La3+ substantially alleviated P-deficiency symptoms. Treatment of young seedlings with La3+ at 150mgL(-1) effectively improved PUE in roots, stems, and leaves via the regulation of root elongation and activation of root physiological responses to P-deficiency, e.g., root activity and acid phosphatase (APase) activity. Root hydraulic conductivity (L-p) was also examined to elucidate the role of La3+ in the relationship between water and nutrition transport. We confirmed that La3+ increased the level of antioxidant protective enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD), while it significantly decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) content. The use of La3+ to reduce photosynthesis damage under P-deficiency was examined. The negative effects of P-deficiency on net photosynthetic rate (P-n), transpiration rate (T-r), maximum photochemical efficiency (F-v/F-m), and chlorophyll content in leaves were alleviated by La3+ treatment. These results clarify the regulatory functions of La3+ in stress tolerance and P utilization in adzuki bean seedlings.

An increase in Indian Summer Monsoon Intensity (ISM) is responsible for the aggradation of sediments as valley-fill deposits in the river basins. In the present study sedimentological, chronometric, and geochemical analysis on the fluvial terrace sequences of Nirona and Bhukhi river basins are being used to interpret southwest summer monsoon variability from MIS 5D-5C along with the fluvial response to local tectonics. The sediment record indicates increased ISM precipitation from-110ka to-90ka, which corresponds to the MIS 5D to MIS 5C (Interstadial stage). The ISM became progressively weaker during the MIS-5B (stadial stage), leading to present-day arid conditions. The climatic factors weakened along with an interplay of local tectonics, leading to present-day conditions of bedrock incision.

The site is located in suburban Beijing and dates from 11,000 to 9000 BP. A total of 14 charred grains of foxtail millet have been collected and identified as of the domesticated species (Setaria italica) according to morphological analysis. One grain of broomcorn millet was also identified. These are the earliest domesticated millet grains recovered by flotation, providing crucial archaeological evidence for understanding the timing, locations, and processes of millet domestication. Moreover, the charred seeds of Setaria viridis provide important clues for exploring the wild ancestral plants of foxtail millet and the domestication process. The results of flotation at the Donghulin site are important for understanding the origins of dryland agriculture in North China, which was predominated by millet farming.

Managing for enhanced native species richness in restoration is a powerful goal and outcome; nonetheless, local species richness can also be used as a proximate mechanism to decide on the lands to acquire, protect, and restore. Here, a meta-analysis was used to test the hypothesis that local species richness is a viable consideration in predicting varied restoration outcomes as identified by the primary researchers for drylands. In all dryland contexts, the most effective restoration outcomes across varied restoration interventions were at mid-to-relatively lower species rich sites. Consequently, restoration of degraded or low diversity arid grasslands is an important strategic opportunity during the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, and plant species richness is an excellent starting point to inform decisions.						lortie, cj/0000-0002-4291-7023; Miguel, Maria Florencia/0000-0002-6951-1576													1061-2971	1526-100X				AUG	2022	30	6			SI				e13697	10.1111/rec.13697	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.13697		APR 2022											WOS:000784795800001

Five Year Analyses of Vegetation Response to Restoration using Rock Detention Structures in Southeastern Arizona, United States	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Rock detention structures (RDS) are used in restoration of riparian areas around the world. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of RDS installation on vegetation in terms of species abundance and composition. We present the results from 5 years of annual vegetation sampling which focused on short term non-woody vegetation response within the riparian channel at 3 restoration sites across southeastern Arizona. We examined the potential ways that RDS can preserve native species, encourage wetland species, and/or introduce nonnative species using a Control-Impact-Paired-Series study design. Species composition and frequency were measured within quadrats and zones on an annual basis. Multivariate bootstrap analyses were performed, including Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index and non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination. We found that response to RDS was variable and could be related to the level of degradation or proximity to groundwater. The non-degraded site did not show a response to RDS and the severely degraded site showed a slight increase in vegetation frequency, but the moderately degraded site experienced a significant increase. At the moderately degraded site, located between two historic cienegas (desert wetlands), species composition shifted and nonnative species invaded, dominating the vegetation increase at this location. At the severely degraded site, pre-existing wetland species frequency increased in response to the installation of RDS. These findings extend the understanding of RDS effects on vegetation, provide scenarios to help land and water resource managers understand potential outcomes, and can assist in optimizing success for restoration projects.

THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS												Key messageStructural variations are common in plant genomes, affecting meiotic recombination and distorted segregation in wheat. And presence/absence variations can significantly affect drought tolerance in wheat.Drought is a major abiotic stress limiting wheat production. Common wheat has a complex genome with three sub-genomes, which host large numbers of structural variations (SVs). SVs play critical roles in understanding the genetic contributions of plant domestication and phenotypic plasticity, but little is known about their genomic characteristics and their effects on drought tolerance. In the present study, high-resolution karyotypes of 180 doubled haploids (DHs) were developed. Signal polymorphisms between the parents involved with 8 presence-absence variations (PAVs) of tandem repeats (TR) distributed on the 7 (2A, 4A, 5A, 7A, 3B, 7B, and 2D) of 21 chromosomes. Among them, PAV on chromosome 2D showed distorted segregation, others transmit normal conforming to a 1:1 segregation ration in the population; and a PAVs recombination occurred on chromosome 2A. Association analysis of PAV and phenotypic traits under different water regimes, we found PAVs on chromosomes 4A, 5A, and 7B showed negative effect on grain length (GL) and grain width (GW); PAV.7A had opposite effect on grain thickness (GT) and spike length (SL), with the effect on traits differing under different water regimes. PAVs on linkage group 2A, 4A, 7A, 2D, and 7B associated with the drought tolerance coefficients (DTCs), and significant negative effect on drought resistance values (D values) were detected in PAV.7B. Additionally, quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with phenotypic traits using the 90 K SNP array showed QTL for DTCs and grain-related traits in chromosomes 4A, and 5A, 3B were co-localized in differential regions of PAVs.

Connectivity but not recruitment: Response of the fish community to a large-scale flood on a heavily regulated floodplain	ECOHYDROLOGY												Recent environmental flow management in the Murray-Darling basin, south-eastern Australia, has centred on restoring natural flooding regimes to meet ecological requirements, including the promotion of native fish recruitment, despite uncertainty about the effectiveness of managed environmental flooding. This study investigated recruitment responses of small-bodied native and non-native fish species to a large natural flood, supported by managed environmental flows in the Macquarie Marshes of the Murray-Darling basin. We surveyed the fish community within the heavily regulated, dryland floodplain system of the marshes, the year after breaking of the Millennium drought (2002-2009). During the spring-summer of 2010, the Macquarie Marshes experienced a one-in-10-year flood, sustained by two environmental flow allocations, flooding 174,000 ha of floodplain. Five native species were collected across the nine study sites. Two non-native species were particularly abundant during the flood, outnumbering the five native species in a ratio of 32:1, with Gambusia holbrooki the most abundant species, comprising 87% of all native and non-native individuals captured. There was no marked effect of flood stage on the total abundance of small-bodied native or non-native fishes, but the composition of the fish community varied between surveys of the rising and falling phases of the flood. We did not capture any larval or post-larval fish despite using a variety of suitable sampling methods. The lack of larvae in the Macquarie Marshes, following extensive flooding, most likely reflected the overall poor condition of native fish communities and low standing stocks of mature fish, resulting from deleterious long-term effects of flow regulation exacerbated by drought. A gradual rebuilding of ecosystem health, fish health, and resilient fish populations by active management of environmental flows to impose more natural boom and bust dynamics may be needed to restore fish reproduction and recruitment in this regulated river.

Cross-host compatibility of commercial rhizobial strains for new and existing pasture legume cultivars in south-eastern Australia	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE												Perennial legumes have potential to increase pasture productivity in the high rainfall zone (600-850 mm) of south-eastern Australia through their ability to use summer rainfall and fix nitrogen (N-2). Various perennial legumes are being evaluated for this environment; however, little information exists on legume-rhizobia cross-host compatibility and its consequences for biological N-2 fixation. This is especially important when legumes are sown into fields with a background of competitive rhizobia such as WSM1325 or sown as a pasture mix with different host-symbiont pairs. We studied the effectiveness and cross-host compatibility of five commercial rhizobial strains for a range of pasture legumes (nine species, 18 cultivars) under controlled environment conditions, and further evaluated nodule occupancy and competitiveness of a newly established pasture (13 species, 20 cultivars) in the field, by determining nodulation and production (biomass and N-2 fixation). Three of the commercial inoculant strains formed root nodules with multiple legume species; commonly however, less N-2 was fixed in cases where the inoculant was not the recommended strain for the legume species. Within a legume species, cultivars could differ in their ability to form effective root nodules with multiple rhizobial strains. White clover cvv. Trophy, Haifa and Storm, strawberry clover cv. Palestine, and Talish clover cv. Permatas formed effective nodules with both TA1 and WSM1325 rhizobial strains. White clover cultivars that could not form an effective symbiosis with the common background strain WSM1325 fixed less N-2. The white clover x Caucasian clover hybrid formed effective symbiosis with strain TA1 but not with other commercial strains. Some species such as birdsfoot trefoil, Talish clover, sulfur clover and tetraploid Caucasian clover formed ineffective symbiosis in the field. Until resolved, this will likely inhibit their further development as pasture plants for similar permanent pasture environments.

Evaluation of fodder yield and fodder quality in sorghum and its interaction with grain yield under different water availability regimes	CURRENT PLANT BIOLOGY												Sorghum is widely grown as a failsafe crop in semi-arid regions particularly in post rainy season. Though the effect of drought on crop performance is studied widely there are few studies illustrating the association of fodder quality and agronomic traits under drought. To study the interactions we evaluated a set of 24 cultivars under drought for three years in post rainy season. The effect of drought was evident in delayed flowering (by 2 days) and reduce plant height (by 0.98 cm) compared to control. The fodder digestibility traits were reduced (in vitro organic matter digestibility by 2.25 times) under drought. All the plant growth and yield parameters recorded higher heritability compared to fodder quality parameters (<0.75) in most of the season in both control and stress environments. The scatter plot showed best (ICSV700-P10, N13, PB15881-3, SP 2417-P3) and poor (296B, ICSB377-P1, ICSV1, 159830) performing entries in control and stress plots. The agronomic and the fodder quality traits have shown no significant relationship between them, hence independent association can be utilized to breed for desirable traits. Identification of contrasting lines could be the key to identify genes controlling the fodder quality traits under drought.

Managing vegetation for stronger cooling efficiency during hot days in the Arabian Peninsula	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The growth of vegetation in desert areas is expected to cause considerable changes to the local climate. Compared to bare ground desert, the balance of different processes related to vegetation such as reduced albedo and increased evapotranspiration can either warm up or cool down the surface climate. Quantifying these changes is essential for impact assessments of climate mitigation and adaptation measures, especially in regions increasingly hit by heat waves such as the Arabian Peninsula. In this respect, the analysis of in situ observations is challenging owing to limited data, uneven vegetation distribution, complex terrain, and other confounding factors. Thus, this study, using long-term satellite data at the daily temporal resolution, estimates the impact of vegetation on land surface temperature for several agricultural regions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Results demonstrate that managed vegetation has a significant cooling effect during the day and particularly during hot weather events, reducing the highest temperatures by > 5 degrees C. During heat waves, managed vegetation can provide an additional cooling effect of about 3 degrees C (2 to 4 degrees C depending on the location). This effect is robustly assessed though a tailored statistical indicator that is suitable for application over complex terrain that are found in the Saudi agricultural sites. However, a situation is identified where the vegetation vigor collapsed and the cooling effect vanished, which was possibly related to issues associated with water management sustainability. Thus, herein, this paper discusses several potential solutions to achieve sustainable irrigation among those that were recently proposed in the scientific literature, such as desalinization from renewable energy and land-use change options that could enhance local precipitation. This study supports the decision-making process of the green initiatives undertaken in the Middle East and similar efforts in other arid regions.

Field-Deployed Extruded Seed Pellets Show Promise for Perennial Grass Establishment in Arid Zone Mine Rehabilitation	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Current methods of mine rehabilitation in the arid zone have a high failure rate at seedling emergence largely due to limited availability of topsoil and low water-holding capacity of alternative growth substrates such as mining overburden and tailings. Further, seedlings have consistently failed to emerge from seeds sown on the soil surface using traditional broadcasting methods. Seed pellets, formed by extruding soil mixtures and seeds into pellets, can potentially increase soil water uptake through enhanced soil-seed contact and thereby improve seedling emergence. We tested an extruded seed pelleting method in a three-factor field experiment (i.e., different pellet-soil mixtures, organic amendments, and simulated rainfall regimes) in north-western Australia. Given the observed lack of seedling emergence from broadcast seeds, the aims of the experiment were to assess: (i) the use of pellets to promote native seedling emergence and establishment and; (ii) the soil physico-chemical and microbiological changes that occur with this method of rehabilitation. The effects of pellet-soil mixtures, organic amendment, and rainfall regime on seedling emergence and survival of three native plant species suggest trade-offs among responses. Pellets made with a 1:1 blend of topsoil and a loamy-sand waste material had the highest seedling emergence, while 100% topsoil pellets had lower emergence probably because of hardsetting. Triodia pungens (a native grass) survived to the end of the experiment while Indigofera monophylla and Acacia inaequilatera (native shrubs) emerged but did not survive. Adding an organic amendment in the extruded pellet inhibited Triodia seedling emergence but increased soil microbial activity. Overall, extruded pellets made from a 1:1 blend showed promise for the establishment of Triodia seeds and beneficially, incorporates mine waste overburden and lesser amounts of topsoil. Further research is needed to improve pelleting production and to test the applicability of the method at scale, for different species and other ecosystem types.

This possibility was evaluated after 33 years of manure application (i.e., farmyard manure at agronomic and elevated rates) compared to an unfertilized control and chemical fertilizer, at an agricultural field site in a Calcic Cambisol on the Loess Plateau. Soil was collected from 0-20 cm (plow layer), 20-40 cm and 40-60 cm depths at the end of the winter fallow season to assess the SOC content in whole soil or in macroaggregate, microaggregate, silt and clay fractions (plow layer only). Long-term management of this site increased the SOC stock (0-60 cm) by 44% in the unfertilized control, up to 68% with chemical fertilizer and from 140% (agronomic rate of farmyard manure) to 189% (elevated rate of farmyard manure). Carbon sequestration efficiency was greater in the unfertilized control (35%) and with chemical fertilizer (up to 31%) than in manure-amended soils (18-23%). Manuring increased the mass of macroaggregates and the specific activity of N-acetyl-glucosaminidase on a per unit SOC basis, which was negatively (P < 0.001) correlated with the specific respiration rate (on a per unit SOC basis) in the whole soil (three depths) and aggregates (plow layer only). Stable macroaggregates were associated with larger SOC stocks and greater organic nitrogen acquisition by microorganisms in the manure-amended soil. This appears to support the microbial nitrogen mining theory. In conclusion, long-term manure application increased soil aggregation as well as stability of the macroaggregate-associated organic carbon, which contributes to SOC sequestration in the Calcic Cambisols on the Loess Plateau.

J	Zhang, BQ; Tian, L; Yang, YT; He, XG				Zhang, Baoqing; Tian, Lei; Yang, Yuting; He, Xiaogang			Revegetation Does Not Decrease Water Yield in the Loess Plateau of China	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Vegetation restoration over degraded drylands has considerable climate, carbon and ecosystem benefits, yet its water impacts remain contentious. Previous studies suggest that extra vegetation in drylands could lead to decreased soil moisture and runoff caused by enhanced evapotranspiration. However, these studies ignore important vegetation-climate feedbacks that can partially offset such negative consequences. Here, we examine how revegetation affects water budgets in China's Loess Plateau, where the world's largest revegetation occurs. Despite increased evapotranspiration, long-term observations exhibit robust increasing trends (2.76 mm yr(-2)) of surface water yield over a large swath (82.3%) of the Plateau since revegetation starts. This is mainly caused by increased regional precipitation that outweighs increases in evapotranspiration. Numerical experiments further reveal that the increased precipitation is largely driven by revegetation-induced enhancement in land-atmosphere interactions that greatly accelerate local moisture recycling. Our findings highlight the importance of considering vegetation-climate feedbacks in assessing hydrological responses to large-scale vegetation changes. Plain Language Summary Vegetation restoration is one of the most effective ecological engineering measures for ecosystem remediation and climate mitigation, and has been widely implemented across the globe over the past few decades. Previous studies suggest that revegetation could threaten long-term water sustainability of the Loess Plateau in China, a typical dryland region that has witnessed widespread vegetation restoration over the past two decades, as extra vegetation consumes more water through evapotranspiration, leading to decreased soil moisture and runoff. Here we challenge this conclusion by showing that a large swath of the Loess Plateau has experienced robust upward trends of surface water yield since the start of large-scale vegetation restoration. This is primarily caused by increased regional precipitation that outpaces the increased evapotranspiration induced by revegetation. Further, we demonstrate that the increase in precipitation is largely driven by enhanced land-atmosphere interactions that accelerate local moisture recycling following revegetation. Our results suggest that previous offline assessments, which ignore important vegetation-climate feedbacks, may overstate the threats of revegetation on dryland water resources. These findings provide an important scientific basis for guiding current and future revegetation activities toward sustainable ecosystem development and water resources management.					tian, lei/HGU-7245-2022; He, Xiaogang/R-7189-2017; yang, yuting/HTT-2479-2023; yang, yuting/Y-7885-2018	He, Xiaogang/0000-0001-7428-0269; yang, yuting/0000-0002-4573-1929; Zhang, Baoqing/0000-0001-6198-6633; Tian, Lei/0000-0001-9117-437X													0094-8276	1944-8007				MAY 16	2022	49	9							e2022GL098025	10.1029/2022GL098025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022GL098025													WOS:000797413700005

Lentil grain quality and segregation opportunities in-field using remote sensing	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												For broad-acre crops grown in Mediterranean-type environments, variation in lentil (Lens culinaris) yield and quality occurs due to seasonal abiotic and biotic stresses. Because grain quality affects the price paid to growers, in-season assessment of likely final quality using remote sensing technologies could limit economic losses by informing spatial management at harvest. For a survey of lentil crops grown in southern Australia, in 2019 and 2020, Moran's I analysis identified significant field spatial autocorrelation for the grain quality traits of grain protein concentration (GPC), grain size, and grain brightness (CIE L*, where CIE is International Commission on Illumination), indicating an opportunity for zoning at harvest. Partial least squares calibration models of observed grain quality and proximal reflectance spectra were successfully derived for grain weight (R2 = 0.80), GPC (R2 = 0.80), and CIE L* (R2 = 0.86). For late senescence, Sentinel-2 satellite canopy reflectance, grain size was best predicted (R2 = 0.79) and GPC was poorer (R2 = 0.42). Spatial maps of fields for grain size, informed by models, could be derived and determined that for the market critical threshold (38 mg), field area that exceeded this threshold ranged between 30% and 94%. Overall, we determined that sensing technologies had utility for mapping lentil grain quality across fields, providing a potential tool for growers to selectively harvest to achieve best aggregate price based on grain quality targets. Further calibration and validation with multiple years and locations is also needed to test model stability and application to varying environments. Variation in lentil grain quality occurs due to abiotic and biotic stresses in dryland cropping environments.Selectively harvesting fields could help growers achieve best aggregate price based on grain quality targets.Remote sensing technologies using canopy reflectance (CR) could inform spatial management of lentil at harvest.Partial Least Squares models of CR could reasonably describe quality traits of grain weight protein and grain brightness.Moran's I identified field spatial autocorrelation for grain quality traits, thus indicating an opportunity for harvest zoning.																			0002-1962	1435-0645				2023 DEC 12	2023										10.1002/agj2.21507	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.21507		DEC 2023											WOS:001121398000001

Location The research was conducted in Desa'a, a dry Afromontane forest in northern Ethiopia, Tigray region. Aims Woody species diversity, extinction debt, recruitment credit and colonisation credit were quantified and mapped based on an inventory of mature and regenerating individuals in 303 systematically sampled plots. Methods To assess tree species population dynamics at the neighbourhood scale, each plot was pooled with 16 neighbouring plots, in which species composition in the mature and regeneration layers was compared to determine the number of regenerating species, extinction debt, recruitment credit and colonisation credit. At the regional scale (150,000 ha), all plots were pooled to obtain the number of regenerating species, extinction debt and recruitment credit. Results The average density of the mature layer was 1,482 individuals per ha, representing 84 species and 44 families, with Juniperus procera and Olea europaea dominating. The regeneration layer had an average density of 14,909 individuals per hectare, with Dodonaea angustifolia and Cadia purpurea dominating. At the neighbourhood scale, the average number of regenerating species, extinction debt, recruitment credit and colonisation credit amounted to 12, 13, 5 and 68 species. Regionally, there were 58 regenerating species, an extinction debt of 26 species, and a recruitment credit of 12 species. Extinction debt was more than twice as high as recruitment credit at both the neighbourhood and regional scale. Conclusion Although regeneration density seemed sufficient to maintain forest density, it consisted of only a few species and is inadequate to maintain species diversity. It is urgent that forest managers recognise this and step-up conservation and restoration efforts in this important forest relic. Assisted restoration is needed for those species potentially at risk of extinction.

The eight consecutive years (2014-2022) field experiment followed a split-plot design, and the experimental factors were nitrogen application rate (N0, N75, N150, N225, and N300) and manure application rate (M0 and M1). In general, (1) the relationships between nitrogen application rate and grain yield (GY), crop N uptake and water utilization efficiency (WUE) followed a quadratic curve. Compared with chemical fertilizer alone (NPK), chemical fertilizer plus manure (MNPK) significantly increased the annual average grain yield by 28.5%, 18.3%, 8.9%, 6.9% and 4.2% at the N application rate of N0, N75, N150, N225 and N300. (2) The nitrate accumulation (SNA) in the same soil layer increased with the nitrogen application rate. The residue nitrate will increase dramatically when the N application rate exceeds 150 kg ha-1. The peaks of SNA gradually moved to the deeper layer with increasing years of fertilization. The total soil nitrate accumulation (TSNA) of NPK was significantly higher than that of MNPK in dry and normal years, but the opposite was true in wet years. The total soil water storage (TSWS) decreased and then increased with the N application rate, and the annual average TSWS of the MNPK treatments was 3.9% less than that of the NPK treatments. (3) The addition of manure significantly increased the annual average moisture storage rate (MSR) during the fallow season by 4.6%. The GY in dry and normal years was more dependent on MSR than that in wet years. In terms of the long-term effects, the MSR contributes more to GY than growing season precipitation (GSP), and the high MSR caused by manure application reduced TSNA and TSWS by promoting crop growth. The results showed that M1N150 could obtain a high grain yield while maintaining low nitrate residue. Taken together, this study emphasized the importance of optimizing nitrogen fertilizer management and cattle manure application in combination with precipitation types to ensure food production and reduce negative environmental effects in the rain-fed area of the Loess Plateau in China.																			0167-8809	1873-2305				SEP 15	2023	354								108586	10.1016/j.agee.2023.108586	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2023.108586		MAY 2023											WOS:001054602900001

Nematode communities differ in Hopi landrace maize and commercial maize	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												Selection pressures of crop breeding in varying abiotic contexts may produce cultivars differing in their relationships with belowground organisms. Nematode assemblages associated with a Hopi maize (Zea mays L.) landrace and two commercial maize varieties were examined at three traditional farms (two irrigated, one dryfarmed) near the village of Moenkopi on the Hopi Reservation in Arizona, U.S.A. At each farm, the landrace and one commercial maize variety were cultivated in close proximity. Within the two irrigated farms, densities of free-living nematodes, but not plant parasitic nematodes, were higher in landrace plots compared to commercial variety plots; however, at the dry-farmed site the nematode assemblages associated with the two maize varieties did not differ. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and multiple response permutation procedure (MRPP) showed that at the irrigated farms, nematode assemblages associated with landrace maize differed significantly from those associated with commercial maize in analyses based on functional guilds, feeding groups and non-phytoparasitic c-p groups. Assemblages at the dry-farmed site were different from those at the irrigated sites in community composition based on morphotypes, functional guilds, and feeding groups, but were similar to the irrigated commercial variety plots based on c-p groups. Nematode abundances were likely constrained by water availability at the dry-farmed site, but at the irrigated sites, nematode community dissimilarities between the landrace and the commercial maize variety may have resulted from differences in plant-soil microbe interactions for the two crop varieties. Selection pressures associated with Hopi agroecosystems might have produced landraces with different belowground allocation strategies than commercial crop varieties selected under high resource conditions.

Native lagomorphs facilitate noxious weeds in a semi-arid rangeland	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Rangeland management has traditionally focused on the grazing effects of livestock, or on wild ungulates because they are potential competitors with livestock. However, herbivory by smaller herbivores, such as lagomorphs, could play a much greater role in shaping the plant community than is commonly thought. Being selective feeders with high mass-specific metabolic rates, we hypothesized that lagomorphs impose an herbivory regime on the rangeland that differs from that of ungulates and drives the plant community toward a different composition. We used an 8-year exclosure experiment with three plot types (complete exclosure, partial exclosure, open rangeland), each 5.95 m2, to separate the effects of grazing by lagomorphs (jackrabbits and cottontails) from the effects of the large grazers (mainly cattle and bison) on vegetation structure and plant community composition. We replicated the experiment across 20 sites in a semiarid rangeland in the western US. The plant community in the complete exclosure plots (lagomorphs and ungulates excluded) developed a fivefold greater standing crop of grass than the open rangeland but supported the lowest biomass, density, and aerial cover of forbs. Partial exclosure plots (ungulates excluded, lagomorphs included) developed a community with higher forb phytomass (33.6% increase relative to open rangeland) and lower forb species richness (16.4% decrease relative to open rangeland). This effect was mainly caused by the encroachment of noxious weeds, including Salsola tragus (prickly Russian thistle/tumbleweed), which covered up to 37% of the ground in plots that lagomorphs had exclusive access to. We infer that selective grazing by lagomorphs facilitates noxious weeds that are elsewhere controlled to some extent by (a) the coarse grazing and trampling effects of large ungulates and (b) competition with native herbaceous species. For semiarid rangelands that have been degraded by livestock grazing, our complete and partial exclosures show that a reduction in stocking rate might not return the rangeland to its former state due to a hysteresis effect resulting from the facilitation of noxious weeds by lagomorphs. Rangeland management should be informed by an understanding of the entire food web, which includes the direct and indirect grazing effects of small herbivores such as lagomorphs.																			2296-701X					OCT 13	2023	11								1237755	10.3389/fevo.2023.1237755	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2023.1237755													WOS:001088505500001

Using trend analysis, the Hurst index, correlation analysis, the Moran index, path analysis, residual analysis, and other methods, the effects of human activities and climate factors on vegetation change were analyzed. The results show that: (1) The research area's normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) exhibited a substantial upward trend from 2001 to 2020, increasing at a rate of 0.003/a, and the vegetation cover was generally healthy. The generally constant NDVI region made up 78.45% of the entire area, and the grassland, cultivated land, and forest land showed the most visible NDVI aggregation features. (2) The Vegetation is mainly promoted by water and heat, particularly precipitation, have a major impact on plants, with the direct influence of precipitation on vegetation growth being much greater than the indirect effect through the temperature. (3) The trend of NDVI residuals showed obvious spatial variability, presenting a distribution characteristic of high in the south and low in the north. The results of this study can provide a basis for the scientific layout of ecological protection and restoration projects in the Yinshanbeilu area.																				2223-7747				SEP	2023	12	18							3312	10.3390/plants12183312	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants12183312								37765476					WOS:001075029900001

However, the responses of different farmland types and tillage-mulching practices on soil salt content (SSC) and water use efficiency (WUE) have not been widely studied in this region. Thus, we conducted a two-year field experiment to assess the soil water content (SWC) and SSC and their effect on the spring maize yield and WUE under different tillage-mulching practices in EF and SF. Eight treatments incorporating flat cropping without mulching (FC), ridge planting without mulching (RP), ridge cropping with straw mulching (SM), and ridge cropping with plastic mulching (PM) were applied to EF and SF plots, respectively. Our results indicated that the yield of spring maize was limited by SWC (p < 0.01). Although EF had a low yield of spring maize compared to SF, it had the highest WUE (p < 0.01), which was mainly due to the lower groundwater consumption. Meanwhile, the average SSC was significantly lower in EF than in SF (p < 0.01). PM had the highest SWC (14.9%) and significantly reduced the accumulation of SSC (-0.09 g kg(-1)), thereby improving spring maize yield (12,200 kg ha(-1)) and WUE (1.71 kg m(-3)) (p < 0.05). These results suggested that EF with PM is optimal for groundwater conservation, decreasing the risk of soil salinization, and improving WUE and maize yield in dryland agricultural areas.

The effects of straw strip mulching and film mulching on dryland soil water storage and temperature, potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) growth and yield, and water use efficiency (WUE) were examined from 2014 to 2015 in the rainfed semi-arid regions of China. Field experiments were conducted with four treatments: (a) alternating strips mulched with maize (Zea mays L.) straw and bare plots with no ridges (SM); (b) alternating large ridges and small furrows with only the ridges mulched with black polyethylene film (PMP); (c) alternating narrows and wide ridges both mulched by black polyethylene film (PMF), and (d) traditional bare land planting without mulching (CK). The results indicated that film mulching had positive effects on soil water storage at the early stage of potato growth, while the SM significantly improved soil water storage at the late growth stage. Soil water storage (0-2-m depth) was 11.3-35.4 mm greater with the SM than that with the other treatments, especially during the tuber bulking in summer drought period. Compared with the CK, the SM significantly decreased soil temperature by 0.8-1.4 degrees C, and increased potato yield by 10.5-34.2%, WUE by 8.9-29.8%, and commodity rate by 14.7-38.8%. Compared with the PMP and PMF, the SM increased potato yield by 4.6-12.9 and 3.4-9.3%, respectively. This might be contributed to increased soil moisture and lower soil temperature, which promoted potato growth, yield, and commodity rates.

This codon usage bias is thought to have evolved for efficient protein synthesis. Synonymous codon usage was studied in genes of the hexaploid wheat Triticum aestivum (AABBDD) and its progenitor species, Triticum urartu (AA), Aegilops tauschii (DD), and Triticum turgidum (AABB). Triticum aestivum exhibited stronger usage bias for G/C-ending codons than did the three progenitor species, and this bias was especially higher compared to T. turgidum and Ae. tauschii. High GC content is a primary factor influencing codon usage in T. aestivum. Neutrality analysis showed a significant positive correlation (p<0.001) between GC12 and GC3 in the four species with regression line slopes near zero (0.16-0.20), suggesting that the effect of mutation on codon usage was only 16-20%. The GC3s values of genes were associated with gene length and distribution density within chromosomes. tRNA abundance data indicated that codon preference corresponded to the relative abundance of isoaccepting tRNAs in the four species. Both mutation and selection have affected synonymous codon usage in hexaploid wheat and its progenitor species. GO enrichment showed that GC biased genes were commonly enriched in physiological processes such as photosynthesis and response to acid chemical. In some certain gene families with important functions, the codon usage of small parts of genes has changed during the evolution process of T. aestivum.					郭, 青霞/GZH-2618-2022															1664-8021				AUG 20	2021	12								732432	10.3389/fgene.2021.732432	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.732432								34490050					WOS:000692515400001

Although consistent migration routes are observed in highly seasonal and predictable environments, movement patterns to utilize ephemeral resources in dryland environments are largely unknown. This makes conservation planning and water policy challenging as the relative importance of widely dispersed wetlands is difficult to rank. We addressed this challenge by combining a citizen science project with the novel application of X-ray fluorescence of feathers to detect continental scale movement of waterbirds using elemental signatures. By doing so, we gained important insight into the movements of 24 waterbird species, including the significance of the Murray-Darling basin as a key source of waterbirds across the continent. Our approach highlights the benefits of elemental signatures to identify key areas of habitat use and priorities for wetland management.

Spatio-temporal dynamics of climate change, land degradation, and water insecurity in an arid rangeland: The Rio San Miguel watershed, Sonora, Mexico	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Rangelands are complex social-ecological systems (SES) commonly used to support ranching and other agrarian livelihoods. Common to Earth's drylands, rangelands are susceptible to drought, desertification, and land degradation from both climatic and human activities. In the arid Americas, ranching communities are often located in watersheds and rely on local riparian resources (e.g. surface- and ground-water) to support crop and animal cultivation. However, anthropogenic climate change in combination with intensified agriculture integrated into international markets degrade both landscape and water resources. In Sonora, Mexico's Rio San Miguel Watershed we find via an interdisciplinary set of methods that rangeland productivity, surface-water reaches, and aquifers are reduced to critical levels, agrarian livelihoods endangered, and within this dynamic, that downstream locations are less resilient and water secure than operations upstream. This spatio-temporal dynamic to water insecurity is due both to (a) latitudinal-based climatic changes and (b) upstream groundwater pumping activity. Participatory rapid rural appraisal, agro-ecosystem analysis, and remote sensing tell us how climate, landscape, water, and ranching operation dynamics are interrelated and affect SES morphology and resilience across time, operations, and sub-watersheds. Partnerships and cooperation among ranchers, subwatersheds, and institutions are among the management and policy interventions available to prepare for or mitigate the developing social-ecological crisis in the watershed. Lessons from Mexico's Rio San Miguel Watershed are relevant for other drylands, agrarian systems, and groundwater-reliant economies, especially as the specter of long-term global climate change and water insecurity looms large for many of the Earth's socialecological systems.

J	Wang, ZQ				Wang, Ziqing			Scaling analysis of Richards equation for horizontal infiltration and its approximate solution	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Richards equation (RE) of Brooks-Corey soil is invariant under some scaling transformations and can be reduced to ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with scale symmetry analysis. From the reduced ODE, it is convenient to get the solution of RE (mostly numerically). The admissible scaling transformations of RE can transform a given solution to other solutions, by which the explicit relations between wetting front (or its velocity) and boundary moisture and between cumulative infiltration and boundary moisture for horizontal infiltration are deduced. For horizontal infiltration into dry soil with constant boundary moisture, the contour of water distribution curve can be represented by a shape factor R, which can be regarded as a constant for a given soil. Based on the reduced ODE and the parameter R, an explicit approximate solution for horizontal soil water infiltration is proposed, which just relies on R. The shape factor R is related to Brooks-Corey power exponent n and independent of the boundary moisture. With the obtained R-n relations, the relative deviation of the approximate solution can be less than 0.001. The approximate solution keeps high precision in any time range of the infiltration process.

Slope engi-neering measures are conducive to improve vegetation growth by improving soil environments. Infiltration hole is an effective supplement of existing measures to enhance the replenishment of deep soil water and nutrients in semi-arid area, but also increases shallow soil evaporation after rainfall. Can mulching further enhance the improved effects of infiltration hole on soil environments in slope measure via reducing ineffective evaporation under field conditions? In this study, the effects of different measures on soil environment and vegetation growth in level ditch were estimated, including control (LD) and infiltration hole (LD-IH), branch mulching (LD-BM), and their combination (LD-IH-BM). The results showed that the replenishment depth of rainfall was not variable under LD-BM after two rainy seasons, however, the one was increased by 40 cm and 30 cm under LD-IH and LD-IH-BM, respectively. The soil water storage (0-300 cm) under LD-IH and LD-IH-BM was obviously increased by 52.5/66.2 mm and 40.4/54.1 mm compared with LD/LD-BM, respectively. The increment of soil water storage (50-150 cm) was significantly higher under LD-IH and LD-IH-BM than LD and LD-BM. LD-BM just increased soil organic carbon and total nitrogen content of 0-10 cm soil layer and LD-IH and LD-IH-BM mainly increased that of 60-100 cm. The soil carbon/nitrogen storage (0-120 cm) was increased by 13.0/0.80 Mg hm-2, 29.8/2.81 Mg hm-2, and 20.3/2.54 Mg hm-2 under LD-BM, LD-IH, and LD-IH-BM, respectively. The contribution in the effects under LD-IH-BM was from infiltration hole rather than branch mulching, and even branch mulching had a negative effect. Overall, the combination of level ditch and infiltration hole is sufficient to promote the reha-bilitation of slope in semi-arid areas by improving soil environment, but adding mulching would not continue to further amplify these effects. Despite these favorable changes, they were insufficient to promote the growth of C. korshinskii during the experimental period of less than two years. Based only on a short-term field trial, practitioners do not need to add mulching to the ecosystem of level ditch and infiltration hole in slope man-agement. However, a longer-term trial is needed to evaluate the necessity for adding mulching because of its long-term effect on soil property improvement. Our findings provide the insight in selecting reasonably slope combined measures to successful vegetation restoration in semi-arid areas.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2023	626		B						130337	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.130337	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.130337													WOS:001105021100001

Yet, it is unclear whether soil moisture drives the SE and CE transformation, plant-plant interaction, and accordingly affect the productivity.MethodsA two-year field experiment was conducted to explore the impacts of soil water status (with and without plastic mulching) on interspecific interaction and productivity and its key mechanism in the maize-faba bean intercropping system.ResultsLow soil moisture reduced the net effect (NE) and land equivalent ratio (LER) with evident yield loss (NE < 0 and LER = 1.05), whereas the improved soil moisture reversed this trend and resulted in overyielding (NE > 0 and LER = 1.13). Regardless of soil moisture, faba bean was the dominant species and maize was the inferior one. Low soil moisture promoted the contribution of SE to productivity (P < 0.05). In contrast, high moisture turned to lower the competition intensity of faba bean against maize and accordingly promote the transformation of biodiversity effect from SE to CE. The main mechanism was that the water competition imposed by faba bean strips on maize ones decreased the NE through reducing photosynthetic rate and water use efficiency of maize.ConclusionThe adaptive transitions of interspecific relationship and the biodiversity effect were driven by soil water availability. This novel phenomenon should be emphasized in the crop diversity management of intercropping system in the rainfed region.					周, 睿/HOA-5317-2023														0032-079X	1573-5036				2023 APR 24	2023										10.1007/s11104-023-06037-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-023-06037-z		APR 2023											WOS:000973909200001

To quantitatively assess the effect of precipitation on ecosystem carbon fluxes during the growing season, a field experiment was carried out in a native desert-grassland ecosystem in Inner Mongolia to determine the dynamics of ecosystem carbon fluxes along a precipitation gradient (-60%, -40%, -20%, CK, +20%, +40%, and +60%; CK is natural precipitation). The net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) exhibited a single peak, whereas ecosystem respiration (Reco) exhibited a bimodal peak across all precipitation treatments. Reco reached its highest value at the beginning of August, whereas NEP and GEP reached their highest values at the end of August. Mean values of carbon fluxes increased with an increase in precipitation (from NEP: 0.06molm(-2)s(-1), Reco: 0.37molm(-2)s(-1), GEP: 0.42molm(-2)s(-1) at -60% to NEP: 1.25molm(-2)s(-1), Reco: 0.93molm(-2)s(-1), and GEP: 2.18molm(-2)s(-1) at +60%). Increased precipitation stimulated GEP more so than Reco during the growing season, resulting in an enhanced NEP, and decreased precipitation reduced GEP more so than Reco, leading to a reduced NEP. We concluded that the carbon sequestration capacity was enhanced by increased precipitation in the desert-grassland ecosystem.

Influence of fire and mechanical sagebrush reduction treatments on restoration seedings in Utah, United States	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Overabundance of woody plants in semiarid ecosystems can degrade understory herbaceous vegetation and often requires shrub reduction and seeding to recover ecosystem services. We used meta-analysis techniques to assess the effects of fire and mechanical shrub reduction over two post-treatment timeframes (1-4 and 5-10 years) on changes in cover and frequency of 15 seeded species at 63 restoration sites with high potential for recovery. Compared to mechanical treatments, fire resulted in greater increases in seeded species. Native shrubs did not increase, and forbs generally declined over time; however, large increases in perennial grasses were observed, suggesting that seeding efforts contributed to enhanced understory herbaceous conditions. We found greater increases in a few non-native species than native species across all treatments, suggesting the possibility that interference among seeded species may have influenced results of this regional assessment. Differences among treatments and species were likely driven by seedbed conditions, which should be carefully considered in restoration planning. Site characteristics also dictated seeded species responses: while forbs showed greater increases in cover over the long term at higher elevation sites considered to be more resilient to disturbance, surprisingly, shrubs and grasses had greater increases in cover and frequency at lower elevation sites where resilience is typically much lower. Further research is needed to understand the causes of forb mortality over time, and to decipher how greater increases of non-native relative to native seeded species will influence species diversity and successional trajectories of restoration sites.

Paliwodzizna 29 is such as site, being a series of pits and hearths at the edge of Lake Grodno in Central Poland. A combination of faunal analysis, lithostratigraphy, pollen, diaspores, charcoal and sedaDNA from the site revealed seasonal collecting-type occupation based on the catching of pike (a superfood) in the spring in the early Mesolithic, but a different foraging-type pattern of occupation probably in the summer in the late Mesolithic. Subtle human impacts on the local environment are also seen, including probably burning of some woodland and reed-beds as well as localized soil erosion.

A field experiment was conducted on Cumulic Haplustoll to investigate the effects of leguminous green manure (LGM) crops and nitrogen (N) fertilizer on dry-stable soil aggregate distributions and stability, the concentrations of organic carbon (OC) and N in the bulk soil and separated aggregate fractions, and soil enzyme activities in dry croplands on the Loess Plateau of China. Species tested as LGM crops were Huai bean (Glycine ussuriensis Regel et Maack.), soybean (G. max (L.) Merr.) and mung bean (Phaseolus radiatus L.). Two rates of N fertilizer (0 and 162 kg N ha(-1)) applied to winter wheat sown after LGM was incorporated into surface soil. Results showed that the inclusion of LGM crops for 6 years significantly increased the total nitrogen (TN), soil organic carbon (SOC), aggregate-associated N and OC concentrations, enhanced the values of aggregate content with >0.25 mm size (R-0.25) and mean weight diameter (MWD), and boosted soil enzyme (invertase, urease, dehydrogenase and aryl-sulfatase) activities at the 0-20-cm depth compared to the bare fallow system under dryland conditions. The long-term application of N fertilizer substantially increased the proportion of macroaggregates (>5.0 mm), MWD and N contents in the 0.25-5-mm size aggregates, and promoted the relative activities of invertase, alkaline phosphatase, dehydrogenase and aryl-sulphatase, but decreased the urease activity. The correlations among macroaggregate fractions and soil chemical properties, aggregate stability and enzyme activities were significant and positive; however, the correlations between small aggregate fractions (<2 mm) and corresponding parameters were negative, or there were no correlations. Overall, combining green manuring practices with suitable N fertilizer application should be recommended to improve the soil quality in dryland regions similar to the Loess Plateau of China. Highlights Green manure crops significantly increased soil enzyme activities, SOC and total N contents. Green manure crops increased macroaggregate (>5 mm) formation and stability. Application of N fertilizer significantly increased the proportions and stability of macroaggregates. Green manure crops along with N fertilizer helped to build better soil quality in a dry loess cropland.

The accurate prediction of T, a key component of water used by forests, requires mechanism-based models describing the T response to environmental and canopy conditions. The daily T of a larch (Larix principis-rupprechtti) plantation was measured through monitoring the sap flow in the growing season (from May to September) of a dry year (2010), a normal year (2012), and a wet year (2014) at a shady slope in the semi-arid area of Liupan Mountains in northwest China. Meanwhile, the meteorological conditions, soil moisture, and forest canopy leaf area index (LAI) were monitored. To get a simple and easily applicable T model, the numerous influencing parameters were grouped into three factors: the atmospheric evapotranspiration demand indicated by the potential evapotranspiration (PET), the soil water supply ability indicated by the relative extractable soil water content (REW), and the vegetation transpiration capacity indicated by the forest canopy LAI. The T model was established as a continuous multiplication of the T response equations to individual factors, which were determined using the upper boundary lines of measured data. The effect of each factor on the T in a dry year (2010) or normal year (2012) was assessed by comparing the measured T in the baseline of the wet year (2014) and the model predicted T, which was calculated through inputting the actual data of the factor (i.e., PET) to be assessed in the dry or normal year and the measured data of other two factors (i.e., REW, LAI) in the baseline of the wet year. The results showed that the mean daily T was 0.92, 1.05, and 1.02 mm; and the maximum daily T was 1.78, 1.92, and 1.89 mm in 2010, 2012, and 2014, respectively. The T response follows a parabolic equation to PET, but a saturated exponential equation to REW and LAI. The T model parameters were calibrated using measured data in 2010 and 2012 (R-2 = 0.89, Nash coefficient = 0.88) and validated using measured data in 2014 satisfactorily (R-2 = 0.89, Nash coefficient = 0.79). It showed a T limitation in the dry year 2010 for all factors (18.5 mm by PET, 11.5 mm by REW, and 17.8 mm by LAI); while a promotion for PET (1.4 mm) and a limitation for REW (4.2 mm) and LAI (14.3 mm) in the normal year 2012. The daily T model established in this study can be helpful to assess the individual factor impact on T and improve the daily T prediction under changing environmental and canopy conditions.					wang, yanhui/HPG-3348-2023	li, zhen hua/0000-0003-2131-0780; WANG, YANBING/0000-0003-1782-2572														1999-4907				DEC	2020	11	12							1303	10.3390/f11121303	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f11121303													WOS:000601986600001

High temperatures drive offspring mortality in a cooperatively breeding bird	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												An improved understanding of life-history responses to current environmental variability is required to predict species-specific responses to anthopogenic climate change. Previous research has suggested that cooperation in social groups may buffer individuals against some of the negative effects of unpredictable climates. We use a 15-year dataset on a cooperative breeding arid zone bird, the southern pied babbler Turdoides bicolor, to test (i) whether environmental conditions and group size correlate with survival of young during three development stages (egg, nestling, fledgling) and (ii) whether group size mitigates the impacts of adverse environmental conditions on survival of young. Exposure to high mean daily maximum temperatures (mean T-max) during early development was associated with reduced survival probabilities of young in all three development stages. No young survived when mean T-max > 38 degrees C, across all group sizes. Low survival of young at high temperatures has broad implications for recruitment and population persistence in avian communities given the rapid pace of advancing climate change. Impacts of high temperatures on survival of young were not moderated by group size, suggesting that the availability of more helpers in a group is unlikely to buffer against compromised offspring survival as average and maximum temperatures increase with rapid anthropogenic climate change.

Gum and resin bearing tree species as the genus Boswellia are the main economic and livelihood sources in most dryland areas of Africa. We use species distribution models to find critical sites where Boswellia species may no longer occur in the future. Our models identify potential regions that could benefit from their cultivation and promote conservation efforts for the species to thrive. We projected models to new CMIP6 scenarios and different dispersal profiles. Despite the prevailing aridity already imposed on the species, Boswellia distribution shows a dramatic reduction. Future investments in Boswellia restoration and strategies to promote sustainable extraction of resources may be key to sustain populations and Boswellia dominated forests in many parts of the African continent.

Fungal communities in rice cultivated in different Brazilian agroclimatic zones: From field to market	FOOD MICROBIOLOGY												Rice is one of the most consumed cereals in Brazil and around the world. Due to the major health impact of rice consumption on populations, studies about its quality have great importance. The present study determined the mycobiota of soil, field, processing and market rice samples from two production systems in Brazil, dryland in the state of Maranhao and wetland in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. These areas are distinct agroclimatic zones. A total of 171 rice and 23 soil samples were analyzed. A high differentiation was observed in the composition of the fungal communities found in the two production systems, as the wetland presented greater fungal incidence and biodiversity. It was observed that toxigenic species from Aspergillus section Flavi and Fusarium, present in the field, may infect rice grains pre or postharvest and may persist into the final product.					da Silva, Josué José/K-8870-2018; Frisvad, Jens C/K-2818-2017; Taniwaki, Marta/ABF-9849-2021; Martins, Ligia Manoel/AAW-1895-2021; Fungaro, Maria Helena/H-7369-2014	da Silva, Josué José/0000-0001-6044-2407; Frisvad, Jens C/0000-0002-0573-4340; Taniwaki, Marta/0000-0002-1676-2101; Manoel Martins, Ligia/0000-0001-5009-1359; Iamanaka, Beatriz/0000-0003-1022-5871; Fungaro, Maria Helena/0000-0002-6199-7030													0740-0020	1095-9998				MAY	2020	87								103378	10.1016/j.fm.2019.103378	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2019.103378								31948619					WOS:000506865300016

This shift has caused some to question whether legume-cereal rotations can remain economically viable options for farmers, particularly in the dry areas. In this paper, we present the results of an endogenous switching regression model which suggests, for the first time, that legume-cereal rotations have clear economic advantages over cereal monocropping. Rotations provide higher yields, gross margins, and consumption of wheat and faba beans. Most past economic analyses on rotation used data from experimental stations or small-sized farmer surveys covering only one season and variety. This study makes an important improvement by employing two-year data from a large sample of 1230 farm households and their 2643 fields cultivated with different varieties of wheat and faba beans in the wheat-based production system of Morocco. Assuming a biennial rotation - the fastest cycle possible in a rainfed dryland system, this paper is also the first to demonstrate that joint adoption of rotations and improved faba bean varieties leads to a two-year average gross margin that is US$537/ha (48%) higher than wheat monocropping. This is the highest economic benefit of all available cropping options. A striking result of the study is that, contrary to common expectations, adopters of rotation did not use lesser amounts of nitrogen fertilizer than those monocropping wheat, thereby undermining the ecological benefits of faba bean-wheat rotations. Given that current average applications are below marginal product-maximizing levels, higher marginal yields of nitrogen fertilizers after rotation help explain farmers' current behavior. Our results suggest that: 1) promoting improved legume varieties may enhance adoption of rotation; and 2) an economic rationale should be used as the main driver of the rotation agenda in the dry areas.

Climate change is having a significant impact on the agricultural sector. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the food security status and sustainability of crop production under different climate change scenarios in the arid and semi-arid zones of Iran. To this end, the Statistical Down-Scaling Model (SDSM) and the outputs of the General Circulation Model (GCM) are employed to project future climate parameters under three climate scenarios. The study then employs the Just and Pope approach by using a panel dataset to evaluate the impact of climate change on crop production. Also, the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique is used to assess the sustainability of crop production from an economic, social, and environmental perspective in the context of climate change and baseline conditions. The results of the study show that precipitation has a significant favourable effect on crop yield in both zones. Maximum temperature is positively and significantly related to crop yield in the semi-arid area, while the relationship is negative in the arid region. Future projections reveal that under different climate scenarios, the production of irrigated wheat, dryland wheat, irrigated barley, dryland barley, and potato crops will change by a maximum of approximately 7.57%, 35.70%, 62.86%, 15.90%, and 26.88% in the semi-arid zone and - 24.07%, 29.73%, - 31.33%, - 4.80%, and 25.80% in the arid zone, respectively. The findings imply that climate change will decrease the food security index for all crops in the arid zone, while improving the situation for crops in the semi-arid region. The results also indicate that future climate change can have a significant adverse effect on economic water productivity, economic benefits, and the sustainability of strategic crop production in the arid zone compared to the semi-arid zone. Given that a large part of Iran is covered by an arid climate, designing coherent adaptation actions and mitigation policies need to be prioritized to tackle the negative impact of climate change on food production systems.

Soil surface treatments and precipitation timing determine seedling development across southwestern US restoration sites	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Restoration in dryland ecosystems often has poor success due to low and variable water availability, degraded soil conditions, and slow plant community recovery rates. Restoration treatments can mitigate these constraints but, because treatments and subsequent monitoring are typically limited in space and time, our understanding of their applicability across broader environmental gradients remains limited. To address this limitation, we implemented and monitored a standardized set of seeding and soil surface treatments (pits, mulch, and ConMod artificial nurse plants) designed to enhance soil moisture and seedling establishment across RestoreNet, a growing network of 21 diverse dryland restoration sites in the southwestern USA over 3 years. Generally, we found that the timing of precipitation relative to seeding and the use of soil surface treatments were more important in determining seeded species emergence, survival, and growth than site-specific characteristics. Using soil surface treatments in tandem with seeding promoted up to 3x greater seedling emergence densities compared with seeding alone. The positive effect of soil surface treatments became more prominent with increased cumulative precipitation since seeding. The seed mix type with species currently found within or near a site and adapted to the historical climate promoted greater seedling emergence densities compared with the seed mix type with species from warmer, drier conditions expected to perform well under climate change. Seed mix and soil surface treatments had a diminishing effect as plants developed beyond the first season of establishment. However, we found strong effects of the initial period seeded and of the precipitation leading up to each monitoring date on seedling survival over time, especially for annual and perennial forbs. The presence of exotic species exerted a negative influence on seedling survival and growth, but not initial emergence. Our findings suggest that seeded species recruitment across drylands can generally be promoted, regardless of location, by (1) incorporation of soil surface treatments, (2) employment of near-term seasonal climate forecasts, (3) suppression of exotic species, and (4) seeding at multiple times. Taken together, these results point to a multifaceted approach to ameliorate harsh environmental conditions for improved seeding success in drylands, both now and under expected aridification.

However, present knowledge is still not enough to understand this paramount aspect of global warming. By using climate model simulations, we first highlight that regional warming amplifications directly following anthropogenic emission would torment many undeveloped countries. Then, we find that cloud has the largest contribution to polar amplification, rather than the frequently blamed sea ice decline. The summertime sea ice decline plays the second role in generating strong wintertime polar amplification via lagged energy release. Our findings also propose that heat uptake by the deeper ocean greatly favors the terrestrial amplification. Additionally, the cloud also shows its importance in helping dryland amplification. Our findings suggest that these robust regional warming amplifications are very likely inevitable under anthropogenic emission, therefore strictest global mitigation is required to prevent unacceptable warming over the high risk regions.

However, the vertical pattern of infiltration partitioning within a soil profile and the factors that control it remain poorly understood, especially in data-scarce mountainous areas. Based on a large-scale long-term soil moisture (SM) network in the Qilian Mountains, Northwest China, we explored infil-tration partitioning and its control factors using a new metric, percentage of soil water storage increment in each layer to the soil profile during a rainfall infiltration event (PSTI). We found that both vegetations with deep roots and wet SM conditions facilitated infiltration into the deeper soil, although meadow favored infiltration within the surface layer. Hillslope stations showed a higher degree of infiltration partitioning in subsurface layers than the flatland stations due to the influence of topography on soil properties. Meanwhile, the increasing slope gradient will reduce the partition of infiltration at the subsurface layers. Among the soil properties, sand content, soil organic carbon, alpha (parameter of soil retention curve), and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity promoted infiltration into greater depth, while clay content and bulk density had the opposite effect. The major factors controlling the pattern of infiltration partitioning were n (parameter of soil retention curve) for 0-10 cm depth, alpha for 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm depths, and SM for PSTI below 30 cm. This quantitative analysis method for the infiltration partitioning improves our understanding of infiltration regimes, and supports water resources management in dryland mountains.

The Texas High Plains is a semi-arid region that faces major challenges from climate change risks and dwindling groundwater supply from the exhaustible Ogallala Aquifer for sustaining irrigated agriculture. The overall goal of this study was to assess the impacts of climate change on yield and water use of grain sorghum and identify optimum climate change adaptation strategies for three study sites in the Texas High Plains. Future climate data projected by nine Global Circulation Models (GCMs) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) of greenhouse gas emissions (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5) were used as input for the DSSAT CSM-CERES-Sorghum model. The climate change adaptation strategies were designed by modifying crop genotype parameters to incorporate drought tolerance, heat tolerance, high yield potential, and long maturity traits. Irrigated and dryland grain sorghum yield and irrigation water use were projected to decrease at varying percentages at the study sites in the future. On an average (of 9 GCMs), irrigated grain sorghum yield is expected to decrease by 5-13 % and 16-27 % by mid-century (2036-2065) and late-century (2066-2095), respectively under RCP 8.5 compared to the baseline (1976-2005). The irrigation water use is expected to decrease by 7-9% and 14-16 % by the mid-century and late-century, respectively. Among the adaptation strategies, an ideotype with high yield potential trait (10 % higher partitioning to the panicle, radiation use efficiency, and relative leaf size than the reference cultivar) resulted in maximum grain sorghum yield gains in the future under both irrigated (6.9 %-17.1 %) and dryland (7.5 %-17.1 %) conditions, when compared to the reference cultivar. Enhancing drought tolerance by increasing root density at different soil depths also resulted in a significantly higher irrigated grain sorghum yield than the reference cultivar. A longer maturity cultivar will likely increase irrigation water use and, therefore, is not recommended for water limited conditions.

Understanding the biophysical mechanisms that influence the balance of soil C flux is important for predicting the responses of dryland soilscapes to many forms of environmental change. This study was done along an upper-to-lower alluvial fan gradient, where debris flows, representing one of the most common erosive processes of dryland soils, cause local-scale changes in soil biotic-abiotic patterns. In this empirically founded study, we assessed (a) the variations in soil CO2 flux and some related physiochemical variables such as soil organic-inorganic C, soil C storage, exchangeable cations, pH, electrical conductivity, and volumetric water content and (b) whether these variations in soil CO2 flux and its association with the above-mentioned soil factors remained constant at three different positions in altitude along the slope of the alluvial fan. Our findings indicated significant differences according to slope position in terms of the flux rate of soil CO2 and associated physiochemical properties. The application of multiple regression demonstrated that the higher soil CO2 flux rates in the upper and middle fan positions are significantly positively correlated with organic C content. Despite the development of biological crusts on the lower fan sediments, they exhibited the lowest rate of soil CO2 flux. Further, low CO2 flux in the lower fan soils was found to be significantly negatively related to pH and inorganic C. This anomaly may be attributed to the alkalinity of the environment formed by the deposition of fine particle sediments on the lower fan position and the fact that CO2 generated by the respiration of mosses may favor the exchange of organic C to carbonate production. Our findings underline the paradoxical impacts of debris flow disturbances on soil C dynamics. This erosive soil disturbance, together with the asymmetric resource redistribution and subsequent variations in the functioning of adjacent alluvial fan positions, can simultaneously provide 'hot spots' of reservoir and flux of soil C within different positions of a depositional landform.

However, how POM and MAOM fractions vary across latitudinal gradients in dryland ecosystems, and what drives this variation remains unclear. In this study, we sampled soils from 100 natural shrubland sites across a latitudinal gradient (23?N to 32?N) in the dry valleys of southwestern China to identify latitudinal patterns of POM and MAOM fractions at four soil depths (0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-30 cm, and 30-50 cm). We found that both C and N fractions in POM and MAOM exhibited a binomial trend with latitude at all depths, whereas the N fractions in POM and MAOM exhibited a pronounced increase at higher latitudes in subsurface soils (20-30 cm and 30-50 cm). Variation in C fractions (i.e., particulate organic carbon (POC) and mineral -associated organic carbon (MAOC)) were mainly explained by the independent effect of soil properties, with the most important explanatory factor being exchangeable calcium. In contrast, variation in N fractions (i.e., particulate organic nitrogen (PON) and mineral-associated organic nitrogen (MAON)) were largely explained by interactions between soil , climate and vegetation properties, with the most important driver being mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation for PON, exchangeable calcium for MAON at 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm depths, and mean annual temperature for MAON at 20-30 cm and 30-50 cm soil depths. Interestingly, climate was more important in explaining variation in C and N fractions in the subsurface soils, and climate and vegetation properties had higher predictive power for soil N fractions than C fractions in the subsurface soils. These results advance our understanding of the role of soil properties on SOM accumulation in dryland eco-systems. Our study also highlights the important impact of climate and vegetation properties in explaining the spatial variation of SOM in subsurface soils, which should be incorporated into large-scale assessments to better predict SOM dynamics.

A total of 72 surface soil samples (0-30 cm) were collected from three land uses (natural rangelands, dryland farming, and apple orchards) in four slope positions (shoulder, backslope, footslope, and toeslope). The soil physicochemical properties and magnetic parameters were measured, and soil redistribution was determined in the selected soil samples using the Cs-137 technique. The results showed that rangeland degradation and, subsequently, rainfed cultivation, led to a significant decline in the soil quality indicators, such as soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available potassium (K-ava), and available phosphorous (P-ava), thus incurring further soil loss, as determined by the Cs-137 technique. Conversely, the conversion and rehabilitation of drylands to apple orchards cultivated on the contour terraces improved soil quality significantly and decreased soil loss (p < 0.05) and soil quality grade (p < 0.01). Additionally, the findings indicated that slope positions relative to land use change had a reasonable impact on the variability of soil properties and soil loss and deposition. The results of Cs-137 analysis showed that the drylands had the highest soil loss (185.3 t ha(-1) yr(-1)) and maximum sedimentation (182. 5 t ha(-1) yr(-1)) in the shoulder and footslope positions, respectively. The random forest model applied between Cs-137 inventory and soil properties indicated that calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE), TN, P-ava, K-ava, and bulk density (rho b) could explain 75% of the total variability in Cs-137 inventory with high R-2 (0.94) and low RMSE (111.29). Magnetic measurements have shown great potential as a cost-effective and fast method for assessing soil redistribution in hilly regions, as confirmed by the findings of the Cs-137 analysis, which agreed well with the magnetic susceptibility at low frequency (chi(lf)). Overall, the results confirmed that restoring abandoned dryland by orchard cultivation may improve soil quality and diminish soil loss in the semi-arid region of Iran. However, further research is required to assess other aspects of the ecosystem affected by this restoration.

Changes in soil organic carbon fractions and residence time five years after implementing conventional and conservation tillage practices	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Tillage not only affects the quantity of soil organic carbon, SOC, but also its quality. Therefore, an investigation was conducted to see how a five-year (2011-2016) implementation of conventional tillage, CT, and conservation tillage practices, CTP's, under dryland vetch - wheat farming system can affect the total organic carbon, TOC, of soil and its fractions as well as its biological indicators including the half-life of organic materials, HL, and the mean residence time, MRT. The applied tillage practices included three CTP's of reduced tillage, RT, with chisel plow, minimum tillage, MT, with stubble cultivator, and no-tillage, NT, with direct seeding as well as one conventional tillage, CT, with moldboard plow. The results revealed that all applied CTP's (RT, MT, and NT) significantly increased the TOC of examined surface soils (0-25 cm) compared to CT. The labile fraction of SOC (dissolve organic carbon, DOC) under CTP's, excluding NT, showed a significant decrease compared to CT. While MT significantly increased the fraction of organic carbon stabilized by clay and silt particles, OC{c + s} compared to CT, NT and RT made no considerable change in OC{c + s} compared to CT. There was also a considerable (but insignificant) increase in the amount of organic carbon stabilized by sand and aggregates plus particulate organic matter, OC{S + A+POM}, under CTP's compared to CT. We recorded the greatest (228 +/- 21 mu g N g(-1) 2 h(-1)) and least (98 +/- 27 mu g N g(-1) 2 h(-1)) activity of urease under RT and CT systems, respectively, and the differences were significant. Based on the incubation data, the NT and RT systems significantly resulted in highest HL, (170 +/- 9 days) for soil organic materials while CT had the lowest HL, (127 +/- 5 days). While RT showed significantly the highest aggregate stability (55 +/- 7 %), the CT and MT had the lowest aggregate stability (29 +/- 4 %). In general, our results demonstrated the benefits of CTP's, and more specifically the benefits of RT and NT systems, in improving SOC, as primary indicator of soil quality, in surface soils under dryland agriculture in terms of quantity and quality of organic carbon.

Process-based farming system models are widely used to predict SOC dynamics in agricultural soils, but their application at regional scales is largely limited by computational requirements, data availability, and uncertainties in model predictions. Here we present an approach of combining a farming system model and a simplified surrogate model that emulates and mimics the behaviour of complex process-based models to predict SOC change (Delta SOC) and its uncertainty in Australian dryland cropping regions under anticipated climate change. We first calibrated and validated the farming system model APSIM for simulating Delta SOC (0-30 cm soil) using data from 90 farming-system trials at 28 sites across the study regions. Next we conducted a comprehensive simulation across the region using the validated APSIM model to predict Delta SOC over the period 2009-2070. Then simple surrogate models were developed based on the APSIM outputs. The surrogate models were able to explain > 96% of the variation in APSIM-predicted Delta SOC. Last the surrogate models were applied across the regions at the resolution of 1 km. In our simulations, Australian dryland cropping soils under farmers' common management practices and future climate conditions were a net carbon source (0.66 Mg C ha(-1) with the 95% confidence interval ranging from -5.79 to 8.38 Mg C ha(-1)) during the 62-year period. Across the regions, simulated Delta SOC exhibited great spatial variability ranging from -108.8 to 9.89 Mg C ha(-1) at the resolution of 1 km, showing significant (P < 0.05) negative correlation with baseline SOC level, temperature and rainfall, and positive correlation with pasture frequency (the duration of pasture in the rotation divided by the whole duration of the rotation) and nitrogen application rate. The uncertainty in Delta SOC and the underlying drivers were also assessed. This study presented a novel approach to efficiently predict future SOC dynamics and their uncertainty at fine resolutions, facilitating the development of site-specific management strategies for soil carbon sequestration.					, De Li Liu/Y-4656-2019; Searle, Ross D/C-5686-2018; Farquharson, Ryan L/D-8843-2013; Luo, Zhongkui/B-8125-2008; Simmons, Aaron/IRZ-6068-2023; Cowie, Annette/E-1485-2016; Moore, Andrew D/D-3418-2009	Searle, Ross D/0000-0003-0256-1496; Farquharson, Ryan L/0000-0001-8017-0031; Luo, Zhongkui/0000-0002-6744-6491; Cowie, Annette/0000-0002-3858-959X; Moore, Andrew D/0000-0002-5675-4720; Liu, De Li/0000-0003-2574-1908; Simmons, Aaron/0000-0002-3638-4945; Grant`, Tim/0000-0002-9868-437X													0016-7061	1872-6259				MAR 1	2019	337						311	321		10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.09.041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.09.041													WOS:000456761500032

Differential Impact of Salinity Stress on Seeds Minerals, Storage Proteins, Fatty Acids, and Squalene Composition of New Quinoa Genotype, Grown in Hyper-Arid Desert Environments	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												The effects of climate change and soil salinization on dryland ecosystems are already widespread, and ensuring food security is a crucial challenge. In this article, we demonstrate changes in growth performance and seed quality of a new high-yielding quinoa genotype (Q5) exposed to sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), and mixed salts (NaCl + Na2SO4). Differential responses to salt stress in growth performance, seed yield, and seed quality were identified. High salinity (mixed Na2SO4 + NaCl) reduces plant height by similar to 30%, shoot and root dry weights by similar to 29%, head panicle length and panicle weight by 36-43%, and seed yield by 37%, compared with control conditions. However, the 1,000-seed weight changes insignificantly under salinity. High content of essential minerals, such as Fe, Zn, and Ca in quinoa Q5 seeds produced under salinity, gives the Q5 genotype a remarkable advantage for human consumption. Biomarkers detected in our studies show that the content of most essential amino acids is unchanged under salinity. The content of amino acids Pro, Gly, and Ile positively correlates with Na+ concentration in soil and seeds, whereas the content of squalene and most fatty acids negatively correlates. Variation in squalene content under increasing salinity is most likely due to toxic effects of sodium and chlorine ions as a result of the decrease in membrane permeability for ion movement as a protective reaction to an increase in the sodium ion concentration. Low squalene accumulation might also occur to redirect the NADPH cofactor to enhance the biosynthesis of proline in response to salinity, as both syntheses (squalene and proline) require NADPH. This evidence can potentially be used by the food and pharmaceutical industries in the development of new food and health products.

G.			<i>Azolla</i> Biofertilizer Is an Effective Replacement for Urea Fertilizer in Vegetable Crops	SUSTAINABILITY												Azolla spp. is a water fern that hosts Anabaena azolla, an N-fixing cyanobacterium, in its dorsal leaf cavities. Azolla occurs naturally in freshwater bodies in warm-temperate and tropical regions, and they have commonly been grown in rice paddies as a living fertilizer, providing N to the rice crop. We evaluated the potential use of Azolla harvested from freshwater bodies and applied as a biofertilizer to dryland vegetable crops. Two-thirds of the greenhouse gas emissions from crop production is attributed to N fertilizer, including fossil fuels used in fertilizer production and transportation. Azolla grown in on-farm ponds could remove CO2 from the atmosphere and minimize the use of fossil fuels in fertilizer production and transport. A 140-d laboratory incubation was used to compare the N mineralization of Azolla biofertilizer with compost and cyanobacterial biofertilizer treatments. Azolla treatments had the greatest N availability at the end of the incubation (73.0%), with compost demonstrating the least N availability (15.5%), and the cyanobacterial biofertilizers moderate in N release (31.6%). A greenhouse study evaluated the N uptake and yield of kale (Brassica oleracea) receiving Azolla biofertilizer compared to urea and organic fertilizers. The nitrogen uptake by kale followed the same pattern as in the incubation study, with the Azolla treatments highest among the organic fertilizers, and urea the greatest overall. Compost yielded better than the control but was the lowest yielding among the fertilizer treatments. Finally, we compared the agronomic effect of Azolla biofertilizer with urea and manure applied at the same N rates to spinach (Amaranthus cruentus) and radish (Raphanus sativus) crops grown in the field on alluvial and peat soils. Fertilizer treatments affected the spinach yield at both locations but did not affect the radish yield. The manure treatment resulted in the highest spinach yields (18-27 t ha(-1)), and the Azolla treatment applied at the same N rate as the manure yielded the same as the manure treatment on the peat soil and had the highest leaf and branch numbers. Azolla shows promise as a biofertilizer for dryland vegetable crops; however, an economic feasibility analysis is needed prior to encouraging the widespread adoption of on-farm Azolla production and use.

J	Wang, L; Ali, G; Wang, ZK				Wang, Li; Ali, Gulnazar; Wang, Zikui			Deep soil water depletion and soil organic carbon and total nitrogen accumulation in a long-term alfalfa pasture	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Deep soil resources are essential for improving the production and ecological functions of dryland ecosystems. Relationships between deep soil water depletion and carbon and nitrogen accumulation in long-term dryland pastures were not well quantified and understood. This study aimed to quantify the changes in deep soil water, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total nitrogen (TN) in alfalfa pasture and identify their relationships with root density. We conducted a field experiment in the south Loess Plateau in 2020 and 2021. Soil water, SOC, and TN contents and alfalfa root length density to 1000-cm-depth were measured in alfalfa pastures and annual crop reference fields. Soil water depletion by alfalfa mainly occurred in the first 6 years with a depletion rate of 41.6, 49.1, and 62.1 mm yr(-1) in the shallow (0-200 cm), middle (200-500 cm) and deep (500-1000 cm) soil layers, respectively. Total depletion after 6 and 19 years were 916.8 and 1049.4 mm, respectively. SOC and TN storages in the shallow and middle layers continuously increased and peaked at 19 years after planting, and those in the deep soil increased quickly in the early ages but showed few changes in the following years. Final SOC and TN storages in the 0-1000 cm profile in alfalfa pasture reached 61.1 and 5.4 kg m(-2), respectively, 13.7% and 20.4% higher than the reference field. Soil in 200-1000 cm contributed to 60.7% and 47.8% of the total SOC and TN storage increments, respectively. The deep rooting system of alfalfa derived soil water depletion and SOC and TN increments, as indicated by the significant relationships between fine root length density and the changes in soil water, SOC and TN storages. Therefore, the deep soil contributed substantially to the carbon and nitrogen sequestration in alfalfa early ages but the contribution was limited by water shortage in the middle and late ages. We suggest stopping alfalfa early (<= 6 years) to increase water sustainability and maintain carbon and nitrogen sequestration efficiencies in the alfalfa pasture and crop rotation system on Loess Plateau.

To achieve this goal, restoration practices should pursue the recovery of the main ground components, arranged in an optimal spatial configuration, to mimic undisturbed natural conditions. Drylands function as complex ecohydrologically coupled systems in which interplant source areas, frequently covered by biocrusts, act as sources of runoff and nutrients to adjacent vegetation, which act as sinks for these resources. Thus, one way to increase dryland restoration success is through an optimal spatial configuration of biocrusts and plants that maximizes an efficient use of the limited resources within the system. In this study, we selected a degraded slope from a limestone quarry located in Almeria province (SE Spain) and modeled how active restoration of the biocrust through soil inoculation with cyanobacteria and its combination with different spatial configurations of vegetation affected runoff redistribution and erosion. For that, we applied the spatially distributed Limburg Soil Erosion Model (LISEM) which was able to predict the erosion measured on the slope during the study period with low error (RMSE = 17.8%). Modeling results showed that the introduction of vegetation on the degraded slope reduced runoff between 2 and 24% and erosion between 4 and 17% for the scenario with plants compared to the one without restoration management. Of all the vegetation spatial configurations tested, the one that provided better results was the scenario in which plants were located in the areas of higher water accumulation (higher topographic wetness index). Moreover, we found that active biocrust restoration by cyanobacteria inoculation significantly reduced erosion by 70-90%, especially during the first stages of plant development, while maintaining water supply to vegetation. These findings highlight the potential of water redistribution and erosion simulation models to identify the most optimal spatial configuration of ground covers that maximizes water and nutrient supply to vegetation, while minimizes water, sediment, and nutrient losses by erosion, thus serving as an efficient tool to plan restoration actions in drylands.

Most experiments on salt stress-related genes have been conducted at the laboratory or greenhouse scale. Consequently, there is a lack of research demonstrating the merit of exploring these genes in field crops. Here, we found that the R2R3-MYB transcription factor SiMYB19 from foxtail millet is expressed mainly in the roots and is induced by various abiotic stressors such as salt, drought, low nitrogen, and abscisic acid. SiMYB19 is tentatively localized to the nucleus and activates transcription. It enhances salt tolerance in transgenic rice at the germination and seedling stages. SiMYB19 overexpression increased shoot height, grain yield, and salt tolerance in field- and salt pond-grown transgenic rice. SiMYB19 overexpression promotes abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation in transgenic rice and upregulates the ABA synthesis gene OsNCED3 and the ABA signal transduction pathway-related genes OsPK1 and OsABF2. Thus, SiMYB19 improves salt tolerance in transgenic rice by regulating ABA synthesis and signal transduction. Using rice heterologous expression analysis, the present study introduced a novel candidate gene for improving salt tolerance and increasing yield in crops grown in saline-alkali soil.

However, the majority studies primarily focus on soil microorganisms in the topsoil, resulting in limited understanding of the linkages between tree species identity and the microbial com-munities that inhabit deep soils. Here we investigated the diversity, structure, function, and co-occurrence networks of soil bacterial and fungal communities, as well as related soil physicochemical properties, to a depth of two meters in dryland forests dominated by either Pinus tabuliformis, a native coniferous species, Robinia pseudoacacia, an exotic broadleaf and nitrogen-fixing species, or both. Tree species identity had stronger effects on soil multifunctionality and microbial community structure in the deep layers (80-200 cm) than in the top layers (0-60 cm). In addition, fun-gal communities were more responsive to tree species identity, whereas bacteria were more sensitive to soil depth. Tree species identity strongly influenced microbial network stability and complexity, with higher quantities in R. pseudoacacia than the other plantations, by affecting microbial composition and their associations. The increased in microbial network complexity and the relative abundance of keystone taxa enhance the soil multifunctionality of microbial productivity, sugar and chitin degradation, and nutrient availability and cycling. Meanwhile, the relative abundance of keystone taxa was more representative of soil multifunctionality than microbial diversity. Our study highlights that tree species identity significantly influences soil microbial community characteristics and multifunctionality, especially in deep soils, which will help us understand soil nutrients processed in plantation forest ecosystem and provide a reference for tree species selection in ecological restoration.

J	Schoener, G; Stone, MC; Thomas, C				Schoener, Gerhard; Stone, Mark C.; Thomas, Charles			Comparison of seven simple loss models for runoff prediction at the plot, hillslope and catchment scale in the semiarid southwestern US	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Infiltration excess overland flow is the dominant mechanism for runoff generation in many dryland watersheds. Event-based rainfall-runoff models therefore partition precipitation into two components: loss and excess precipitation. The latter is then transformed into a runoff hydrograph. Numerous loss models have been developed over the past century ranging from simple empirical to sophisticated physically based methods. Complex models can lead to equifinality and associated uncertainty at larger spatial scales with varying soil and cover conditions. Simple models are therefore widely used in hydrologic practice. In the absence of measured data in many arid and semiarid regions, model parameters are often estimated based on laboratory or field infiltrometer tests. Given the documented importance of spatial scale on the runoff response in dryland catchments, it is not clear how models parameterized at the point or soil column scale will perform at the hillslope or catchment scale under real-world conditions. In this study, we compared the performance of seven simple loss models with three or less parameters: the Philip, Smith-Parlange, Horton, Kostiakov, curve number (CN), initial and constant (IC) and the linear and constant (LC) models. The latter is a modification of the IC model introduced in this study. We estimated parameters at the plot scale (2.8 m(2)) using rainfall simulation and then tested model performance at the hillslope (1.5-3.7 ha) and catchment scale (2.4-2.8 km(2)) based on measured rainfall-runoff data at two sites in New Mexico and Arizona, U.S. Results show that rainfall simulation can be used successfully to parameterize loss models at the hillslope scale. At the catchment scale, most models showed positive bias, suggesting that other losses (such as channel or transmission losses) play an important role in determining the catchment runoff response. Rainfall intensity and temporal distribution were found to be crucial for accurate runoff prediction. Models that are sensitive to rainfall intensity during the entire simulation (Philip, Smith-Parlange, Horton, Kostiakov, LC) therefore performed better than those with an initial abstraction term (CN, IC). During intermittent rain, the best results were achieved by methods expressing infiltration capacity as a function of cumulative infiltration (LC, Smith-Parlange).

Leaf litter decomposition is a key component of global biogeochemical cycles that influence soil carbon storage, nutrient availability and plant productivity. Ongoing climate change will lead to warmer and drier conditions in many dryland regions, potentially affecting litter decomposition and nutrient dynamics. Climate change effects can be direct and/or indirect, for example, through changes in litter quality, yet their relative importance on litter decomposition remains unclear. 2. We conducted a manipulative study in a semi-arid shrubland to assess the effects of leaf litter quality, forecasted climate change, that is, +2.5 degrees C warming (W), 30% rainfall reduction (RR) as well as their interaction (W + RR) to elucidate their relative effects on litter decomposition. 3. Climatic effects alone reduced decomposition of a homogeneous Control leaf litter collected from Helianthemum squamatum shrubs growing in unmanipulated plots by 23.4%, 18.1% and 29.8% in the W, RR and W + RR treatments respectively. Leaf litter quality was lower in shrubs that had been growing in warmed plots (W and W + RR), as they had lower nutrient concentrations (P, Fe) and higher C:N and C:P ratios than leaf litter produced under ambient (Control) conditions. Lignin concentration was significantly lower in litter from W + RR plots, yet when both climate and litter quality were considered simultaneously, decomposition rates were 32.0%, 26.3% and 39.9% lower in W, RR and W + RR plots compared to Controls. In addition, we found greater microbial N immobilization in leaf litter incubated within warmed (W and W + RR) than within non- warmed plots (Control and RR). Structural equation modelling showed that higher litter moisture and microbial biomasscontents stimulated decomposition. Simulated climate change (W, RR and W + RR) reduced decomposition indirectly by negatively affecting litter moisture contents and litter microbial biomass. Microbial nitrogen immobilization was stimulated by the lower quality (i.e. high C:N ratios) of the leaf litter collected in shrubs from warmed plots (W and W + RR). 4. Synthesis. Our findings indicate that forecasted climate change conditions slow down C and N cycling in a dryland ecosystem, an effect that is further exacerbated by climate change-induced reductions in litter quality and related reductions in bacterial and fungal biomass in litter.

Soil organic carbon dynamics and crop yields of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>)-black gram (<i>Vigna mungo</i>) rotation-based long term manurial experimental system in semi-arid Vertisols of western India	TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Achieving sustainable crop productivity and maintenance of concurrent soil organic carbon (SOC) at desired levels in cereal-based cropping systems in relatively, poorly fertile Vertisols in semi-arid rainfed ecosystem is challenging task for dryland researchers. Different soil fertilization practices can contribute to carbon (C) sequestration, which requires a detailed knowledge of SOC dynamics in soil profile (0-1.0 m). We conducted a field experiment for 6 years to study the effect of applying mineral fertilizers and organic amendments (FYM, compost, green leaf and crop residue) on profile SOC stocks, C sequestration, SOC sequestration rate, C buildup rate and sustainable yield index (SYI) of maize and blackgram crops in dry semi-arid Vertisols of western India. The study encompasses different nutrient management viz., 100% recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF) of NP, 25 kg ha(-1) N (FYM) + 25 kg N (Urea) + 30 kg P ha(-1), 25 kg ha(-1) N (Compost) + 25 kg N (Urea) + 30 kg P ha(-1), 25 kg ha(-1) N (Crop residue) + 25 kg N (Urea) + 30 kg P ha(-1), 15 kg ha(-1) N (FYM) + 10 kg N (Crop Residue) + 25 kg N (Urea) + 30 kg P ha(-1), 15 kg ha(-1) N (FYM) + 10 kg N (Compost) + 25 kg N (Urea) + 30 kg P ha(-1), 15 kg ha(-1) N (FYM) + 10 kg N (Green Leaf) + 25 kg N (Urea) + 30 kg P ha(-1), 100% recommended N (urea) without P and unfertilized control. Randomized Complete Block design was used wherein all the treatments were replicated thrice. Application of 15 kg ha(-1) N (FYM) + 10 kg N (Crop Residue) + 25 kg N (Urea) + 30 kg P ha(-1) significantly improved the SOC concentration of the soil profile (0-1.0 m) than unfertilized control and treatments receiving solely mineral fertilizers. Highest SOC profile stock, C sequestration with concomitant C buildup was obtained with 15 kg ha(-1) N (FYM) + 10 kg N (Crop Residue) + 25 kg N (Urea) + 30 kg P ha(-1). A positive correlation is observed between total C input and profile mean SOC content (R-2 = 0.74), profile C stock (R-2 = 0.76), C sequestration (R-2 = 0.76), C sequestration rate (R-2 = 0.76) at P values < 0.01. The conjunctive use of 15 kg ha(-1) N (FYM) + 10 kg N (Green Leaf) + 25 kg N (Urea) + 30 kg P ha(-1) and 25 kg ha(-1) N (FYM) + 25 kg N (Urea) + 30 kg P ha(-1) resulted in highest mean grain yield of maize and blackgram, respectively, which were significantly superior to treatments receiving mineral fertilization alone. Application of organic amendments in combination with mineral fertilizers was found superior in improving the SYI. Critical C input of 1.14 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) is suggested to be added in the soils externally to offset depletion of C and maintaining SOC at equilibrium in the semi-arid Vertisols of western India.																			0564-3295	2661-8982				SEP	2019	60	3					433	446		10.1007/s42965-019-00044-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42965-019-00044-x		NOV 2019											WOS:000497820500001

Negligible Impact on Precipitation From a Permanent Inland Lake in Central Australia	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												For over a century, numerous proposals for increasing available water in central Australia have been raised, inspired in part by the natural occurrence of the ephemeral lake, Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre. It has also been proposed that additional rainfall generated by the lake would spread beyond the lake itself, potentially opening up large tracts of uncultivated land to dryland agriculture. Here we use a climate model to examine how adding a permanent lake to Australia's arid center might influence local and regional precipitation. Locally, evaporative cooling from the lake increases low-level divergence, suppressing precipitation. Regionally, additional moisture from the lake is spread thinly over the Australian continent, resulting in little change to total precipitation. Overall, our results do not support the assertion that maintaining a large inland lake like Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre in central Australia would significantly increase precipitation, either locally or regionally.

Previous studies mapped woody cover during historical periods observed by satellites, however, it remains unclear how woody cover is expected to change in response to future climate change. Here, we develop data-driven models to predict woody cover in Africa using multiple environmental predictors and show that woody cover can be accurately modeled using Random Forest. Empirically-based simulations forced by precipitation from CMIP6 project an overall increase in woody cover at the continental scale by 2100. However, increases are mainly occurring in regions with annual precipitation less than & SIM;1,600 mm y(-1), whereas woody cover is predicted to decrease in areas of higher rainfall. Our results suggest that climate change may alter the functioning of dryland ecosystems by continued woody encroachment and cause a loss of carbon stocks in humid areas.

Decadal climate variability, water availability and cropping: the value of forecast information in South-Central Texas	CLIMATE RESEARCH												Decadal climate variability (DCV) phenomena are ocean-based conditions that have climate influences persisting for a decade or more. Few studies have addressed the coupled agricultural and economic implications of these phenomena. Here, we investigate the economic value of DCV information in a South Central Texas case study along with the nature of possible adaptations to the information. To do this we first perform an econometric estimation of DCV impacts on regional crop yields and groundwater recharge. We then expand a regional economic and hydrological model to include DCV information. We find significant DCV impacts on regional aquifer recharge and crop yields for oats, dryland sorghum, and irrigated winter wheat. DCV information has substantial value with perfect information ranging from US$3.79-3.93 million yr(-1) plus benefits for springflow protection, while a less perfect forecast is worth $1.47-1.89 million yr(-1). We also find DCV adaptations involve changes in crop mix and water use.

It is critical to choose an appropriate mulching technique for high yield and sustainable development of fruit crops. To solve the impact of water shortage on the production and growth of fruit trees on the Loess Plateau (China), the effects of different surface mulching techniques on an orchard ecosystem were monitored from 2008 to 2015. Different mulching methods, including grass cover (GC), film mulching (FM), straw mulching (SM), and gravel mulching (GM), effectively enhanced the regulatory capacity of soil water reservoir. The soil water content of SM and FM treatments was higher compared with other treatments. With the increase of planting age, the use of deep soil water increased, soil water content showed a decreasing trend, and soil desiccation was partially alleviated. Different mulching treatments improved water use efficiency and apple yield, with the best effect being achieved with GM and SM. GM resulted in lower soil water content, while it increased the proportion of short and medium branches, thus increasing the yield of apples. The water use efficiency was higher and the effect was better for the GM treatment during 2008-2012; thereafter, the benefits decreased due to a mixture of gravel and topsoil. SM produced higher soil water content and apple yield, and its regulation effect on temperature was better than other treatments. Although the soil water content of FM was relatively high, the corresponding yield and water use efficiency were low. The root growth of fruit trees was affected by high summer heat in the FM treatment. Given the high cost of labor required for GM, SM was an appropriate technique to improve the hydrological status and fruit yield of apple orchard soil in the gully region of the Loess Plateau.																			0304-4238	1879-1018				FEB 27	2019	246						643	651		10.1016/j.scienta.2018.11.028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2018.11.028													WOS:000456762700074

Remote sensing has been widely used to estimate vegetation cover and the C-factor, but most previous studies only used the photosynthetic vegetation (PV) or green vegetation indices (VI, e.g., normalized difference VI) for estimating the C-factor and the important non-PV (NPV) component was often ignored. In this study, we developed a new technique to estimate monthly time-series C-factor using the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) including both PV and NPV, and weighted by monthly rainfall erosivity ratio. The monthly FVC was derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer and LANDSAT data with field validation. We conducted the case-study over China's Loess Plateau and analysed the spatiotemporal variations of FVC and the C-factor and their impacts on erosion over the Plateau. Our study reveals a significant increase in total vegetation cover (TC) from 56 to 76.8%, with a mean of 71.2%, resulting in about 20% decrease in the C-factor and erosion risk during the 17-year period. Our method has an advantage in estimating the C-factor from TC at a monthly scale providing a basis for continuously and consistently monitoring of vegetation cover, erosion risk and climate impacts.

The paper finds that proper management and harvesting of surface and subsurface runoffs in hapas can facilitate groundwater recharge and increase both net irrigated area and moisture in soil leading to higher cropping intensity and yield in dryland areas. However, dissected plateau and residual hillocks can reduce irrigation efficiency of hapas. Although sprinkler or drip irrigation along with cultivation of drought and lateritic resilient, low moisture crop can help in coping up with geophysical and climatic vulnerability, appropriate crop diversification is also necessary. There is also a need for regular maintenance and desiltation of hapas. The water user groups should play an active role for this, especially for hapas in common land. Further, scientific guidance is necessary for designing appropriate structure of hapas in different geo-physical conditions.

A universal trade-off exists whereby plants cannot maximize their PNutUE and their intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi, carbon gain per unit water spent) simultaneously, because any increase in intercellular CO2 concentration (c(i)) through a greater stomatal opening would increase PNutE but also enhances transpiration and therefore decreases WUEi. Rising temperatures associated with climate change can result in large decreases in WUEi in semiarid shrubs through photosynthetic machinery impairment and enhanced stomatal conductance and transpiration, but we know remarkably little about the influence of warming and drought on PNutUE and its interplay with WUEi in dryland vegetation. Using a 6-year (2011-2017) manipulative field experiment, we examined the effects of warming (2.5?, W), rainfall reduction (30%, RR), and their combination (W+RR) on the photosynthetic use efficiency of three essential nutrients (PNUE, PPUE and PKUE) and on WUEi in three shrub species growing at two semiarid shrublands for the years 2015-2017. Across species, warming (W and W+RR) reduced PNUE by 42.9%, PPUE by 43.8% and PKUE by 41.5% on average relative to shrubs growing under ambient temperatures, whereas RR did not significantly affect their PNutUE. These drastic reductions in PNutUE with warming were mainly driven by non-stomatal and largely non-nutritional decreases in net photosynthetic rates, which were almost halved in warmed shrubs. The photosynthetic use efficiencies of N, P and K were inversely related to foliar d(13)C, a proxy for time integrated WUEi, in both ambient (control and RR) and warmed (W and W+RR) shrubs, but with significantly smaller slopes and intercepts for warmed shrubs. Thus, plants achieve a smaller gain in PNutUE for any given increase in stomatal conductance (and reduction in WUEi) under warmer climatic conditions. The strong negative impact of warming on PNutE, along with the warming-induced shift in the trade-off between PNutUE and WUEi, could be indicative of an increasing inability of native plants to cope with warmer conditions, with dire implications for dryland vegetation productivity and survival under climate change.

J	Stokes, M; Gomes, A				Stokes, Martin; Gomes, Alberto			Alluvial fans on volcanic islands: A morphometric perspective (Sao Vicente, Cape Verde)	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The distribution, morphology and development of volcanic island alluvial fans are investigated using Sao Vicente from the Cape Verde volcanic chain (east-central Atlantic Ocean). This is a tectonically and volcanically inactive dryland setting, comprising an eroded Plio-Pleistocene composite volcano overlying a submarine shield volcano. We mapped 228 alluvial fans, titianifing fan (F) and catchment (C) morphological properties (area [A], gradient [G], relief [R], length [L]). Fans and catchments of varying size and gradient are distributed around the island coastal margins (6%) and along interior valley sides (94%). Regression results (i.e. +ve/-ve slopes of best fit lines) conformed to broader fan research but with weak correlations, and coefficient-exponent values outside, or at the lower end of values reported from non-volcanic settings. Analysis of fan area and gradient vs catchment area regression residuals revealed fans were dominated by small-steep gradient (28%) and large-low gradient forms (39%). Fan building space is a fundamental control, specifically linked to volcano structure, but with interplay between rock strength, base level, and climate. Fans around the volcanic edifice flanks are uncommon due to steep flank slopes. Where flank margin fans occur they are typically small and steep forms due to marine erosion. Fans along flank incised valleys are common. Large low gradient fans are associated with a major volcanic riftaligned valley structure, with extensive erosion into altered and weathered edifice-core lithologies. Smallsteep gradient fans are associated with edifice flank valleys. Steeper and narrower valley forms reflect incision into stronger lithologies of the composite volcano flanks, restricting fan building space. Fans located within the volcano central depression are amongst the largest and lowest gradient types, building into the eroded and unconfined edifice core space. Coalescence, apex-toe incision, toe erosion and catchment stream channel backfilling displayed by most fans suggest landscape erosion dominates during more arid periods (e.g. interglacials), with the dryland setting generating limited sediment and insufficient flood runoff for transport and fan deposition. Fan building likely occurs during wetter periods linked to Quaternary climate variability. Quatemary eustatic variations are relevant for the volcano edifice margins where sea level changes control fan building space and erosion. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Leichhardt, land clearing and livestock: the legacy of European agriculture in the Brigalow Belt bioregion of central Queensland, Australia	ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE												Context The Brigalow Belt bioregion of central Queensland has been extensively developed for agriculture since exploration by Leichhardt in 1844. About 4.5 million hectares of vegetation dominated by brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) was cleared as part of the Land Development Fitzroy Basin Scheme, which commenced in 1962. When the Vegetation Management Act 1999 commenced, 93% of brigalow woodland had been cleared. Grazing is the dominant land use in the Fitzroy Basin, with 2.6 million cattle over 11.1 million hectares (72% of the catchment area). This is the largest cattle herd in any natural resource management region in Australia, accounting for 25% of the state herd and 11% of the national herd. Aims The Fitzroy Basin, Queensland's largest coastal catchment, drains directly to the Great Barrier Reef, and as reef health continues to decline, there has been increased focus on the impacts of land-use change and grazing management on hydrology and runoff water quality. The Brigalow Catchment Study sought to determine the impact of land clearing, land-use change and land management on hydrology, soil fertility, water quality and animal production in the Fitzroy Basin. Methods The study is a paired, calibrated catchment study. Catchment hydrology, soil fertility, water quality and agricultural productivity were monitored before and after land clearing and land-use change. Key results The Brigalow Catchment Study has shown that clearing brigalow for grazing in the Fitzroy Basin doubled runoff, increased peak runoff rate by 50% and increased total suspended solid loads by 80%. Soil fertility and pasture productivity also declined under grazing compared with brigalow. Overgrazing exacerbated these results, as failure to reduce stocking rate with reduced pasture productivity more than tripled runoff, peak runoff rate and total suspended solid load compared with conservatively grazed pasture. Conclusions This study demonstrates the impacts of land-use change and land management on hydrology, soil fertility and water quality. The long-term data records are a model in their own right, capable of answering land-use and land-management questions beyond the initial study scope. Implications Sustainable grazing management should consider the production limitations of depleted soil and pasture resources to minimise land degradation.

Sedimentology and geomorphology of Lake Yamma Yamma-A long-lived structurally controlled playa lake of the Lake Eyre Basin, Australia	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA												Intraplate tectonism and continental climate change have important roles in the evolution of the arid Lake Eyre Basin, one of the world's largest interior basins, and a place with economic, environmental, and cultural significance for many Australians. Just off one of the main rivers of the Basin, Cooper Creek, Lake Yamma Yamma a 20 km by 40 km ephemeral feature - traps sediment similar to 750 km upstream and similar to 90 m higher than the ultimate base level of the Basin - Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre. This paper is the first to report on the sedimentology and geomorphic evolution of this modern ephemeral playa lake. Field-based sedimentology, laboratory-based grain size analysis, satellite image interpretation, inundation frequency maps, hydrological data, and digital elevation data, were used to interpret sedimentary processes and the evolution of the lake. Results suggest Lake Yamma Yamma is a long-lived feature. Evolution is primarily structurally controlled, with the main lake delta migrating north-west over time. Quaternary fluvial, lacustrine and aeolian deposition is likely controlled by intraplate tectonism, and palaeo-shorelines may be remnant features of a prior climate regime. Age dating of this sedimentary archive could provide important information on the history, palaeoclimate, and evolution of the Lake Eyre Basin, and the Australian continent.

Carbon and water balances are especially crucial to the sustainable ecosystem and functional returns in sensitive regions such as the Mongolian Plateau. In this study, the significance of non-climatic component (NCC) on carbon and water use efficiency (CUE and WUE) is quantified among the ecosystem types on the Mongolian Plateau. We mapped the spatial gradients of carbon/water balance and delineated the hotspots of NCC-driven CUE and WUE for 2000-2013 using gross and net primary production (GPP and NPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) products derived from the MODIS databases. Significantly higher CUE and WUE values were found in Mongolia (MG) than in Inner Mongolia (IM) due to both climatic forcing (CF) and NCC. NCC was found to dominate the changes in CUE and WUE in the steppes on the plateau by over 16% and 22%, respectively, but with spatially uneven distributions. NCC-driven WUE values were much higher than those driven by CF. The hotspots for NCC-driven CUE did not overlap with those of WUE, with CUE hotspots concentrated in the east of MG and northeast of IM; WUE hotspots were found in the central and Khangai regions of MG and eastern regions of IM. The NCC-driven CUE area in MG was from population growth and the industrial shares in gross domestic product, while the NCC-driven WUE area was due to livestock growth in MG but driven by the growth of cultivated lands in IM. In sum, we conclude that NCC provoked substantial spatiotemporal changes on carbon and water use. CF and NCC effects on carbon and water balance varied in space, by ecosystem type, and between the two political entities.

J	Li, SL; Bowker, MA; Xiao, B				Li, Shenglong; Bowker, Matthew A.; Xiao, Bo			Impacts of moss-dominated biocrusts on rainwater infiltration, vertical water flow, and surface soil evaporation in drylands	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Globally widespread biocrusts form a "living skin" on most dryland soils, helping govern fundamental ecosystem functions, particularly hydrological processes. However, the underlying mechanisms of biocrust effects on soil water infiltration and evaporation are still controversial. Biocrusts possibly regulate infiltration and evaporation due to their unique physicochemical properties and influence on surface soil moisture (theta), and these assumptions were verified in this study conducted on the Loess Plateau of China. The differences in vertical soil moisture distribution and flow patterns of infiltration water between moss-dominated biocrusts and bare soil were investigated through dye tracing experiments. The evaporation characteristics of biocrusts and bare soil were also obtained by weighing micro-lysimeters in both simulated and in-situ experiments. Results showed that biocrusts retarded deep soil water infiltration below similar to 15 cm and significantly (F = 48.15, P < 0.001) decreased the stained area ratio (percentage of stained area to total area at the same soil depth) by 16% in contrast to bare soil. Because the infiltrated water was mostly retained in shallow soil (0-15 cm) in biocrust-covered soil, their ratios of low interaction flow (stained path width < 20 mm) and high interaction flow (20 mm < stained path width < 200 mm) were significantly higher (F >= 7.82, P <= 0.007) than those of bare soil. After the dye tracing experiments, the biocrusts modestly increased theta by 17% throughout the soil profile (0-50 cm), but they remarkably increased 0 by 33%-78% in the top 20 cm of soil. Additionally, the biocrusts increased soil daily evaporation rate (E) by 27%-39% (with only the exception of the beginning) and the cumulative evaporation amount by 14% in contrast to bare soil over an 8-day field measurement. More importantly, the biocrust-affected soil properties, such as the contents of fine particles and organic matter, as well as saturated water content and field capacity, were closely correlated with E (vertical bar rho vertical bar >= 0.52, P <= 0.08). Consequently, it was concluded that biocrusts restrict the depth of rainwater infiltration and increase surface theta, which may greatly enhance surface soil evaporation in the Chinese Loess Plateau.

Climate and agricultural risk: Assessing the impacts of major climate drivers on Australian cotton production	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												Climate variability and extremes adversely impacts Australian cotton crop production and imposes a major constraint on farm planning, industry supply chains and resource allocation. This study reviews time-series yield and crop production methods to account for climate, as well as perform a cotton yield and climate time series analysis using rainfall and temperature data. This study demonstrates that dryland lint yield gains during average-to-moderate rain/temperature years while irrigated lint yields have improved during more frequent average rain/hot growing seasons (1997-2018). Results also discovered climate in central cotton growing areas is impacted by El Nin similar to o Modoki and Nin similar to o4 indices and the various phases of ENSO.

Wheat soil-borne mosaic: Yield loss and distribution in the US Pacific Northwest	CROP PROTECTION												Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV), the causal agent of Wheat soil-borne mosaic (WSBM) was discovered for the first time in the dryland wheat production zone of the US Pacific Northwest (PNW) in 2008. Current WSBM distribution in the Walla Walla Valley that spans the Oregon/Washington border was documented during 2017 and 2018. Yield loss estimates of rainfed winter wheat were also determined for this growing region. WSBM is more widely distributed in the Walla Walla Valley than was previously estimated. Significant reductions of grain yield (40%), biomass (37%), and heads per area (34%) were documented in association with SBWMV infection in commercial winter wheat fields each year. Test weight was reduced by 2.3% (P = 0.08). No significant difference in the number of spikelets per head was observed in association with WSBM. This work is part of an ongoing effort to provide management solutions to WSBM.

Using potato as the research material, a field trial was carried out from 2020 to 2022 in dryland agricultural areas of China, with two treatments of ridge planting with a furrow mulching straw pattern (SML) and flat planting without mulching (CK). The responses of the dryland potato yield, water use efficiency (WUE), and soil hydrothermal properties to the two cultivation patterns were investigated. The results indicated that during the potato reproductive period, the soil temperature of 0-25 cm in the SML treatment dropped by 0.70-0.83 degrees C, in comparison to CK; the ridge and furrow-covered belt, which showed a warming effect at 7:00 a.m. in the seedling stage (SD) and the budding stage (BP), was lower than CK in all the rest of the time, and also the planting belt on the ridge, which cooled down significantly at 14:00 a.m. and the performance varied between the years of 7:00 a.m. and 17:00 a.m. SML significantly decreased the water consumption before BP but significantly increased it after BP in the year of median water and mild drought, while the total amount of water consumed during the entire growing season did not differ significantly from CK's. In the year of moderate drought, SML's total water consumption was significantly less than that of CK, with the water consumption significantly lower before BP and after the tuber bulking stage (TB), but significantly higher from the BP to the TB. In three consecutive growing seasons, SML increased the yields by 9.72-41.67% and WUE by 4.62-11.14% compared with CK, with the yields significantly or positively connected with the average soil temperatures at the TB, the starch accumulation stage (SA), and the water consumption from the BP to the TB. Overall, partial straw mulching could be used as a cultivation technique to achieve sustainable agricultural development in dry farming areas.																				2073-4441				NOV	2023	15	22							3971	10.3390/w15223971	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15223971													WOS:001113748800001

It also examines social dynamics related to agricultural production, cooperation behaviour and traditional production activities from this particular context. A personal (Ego-centered) social network approach was used to achieve an in depth look into these strategies and behaviour, but especially to explore local social structure. Results show denser networks for traditional farmers in comparison to those using agricultural machinery along with other structural indicators and network attributes supporting greater connectivity for smaller producers. The results also reaffirm the potential of social network analysis in assessing the relationship between agricultural production and sustainability in rural regions with mixed socio-economic systems.

The New Zealand Dryland Forests Initiative (NZDFI) has established a tree-breeding program to develop genetically improved planting stock for durable eucalyptus plantations. In this study the durable heartwood of Eucalyptus bosistoana, Eucalyptus globoidea and Eucalyptus argophloia was characterized by near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and NIR data was calibrated with the extractives content (EC), determined by accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) extraction, by means of a partial least squares regression (PLSR) model. It was possible to predict the EC content in the range of 0.34-18.9% with a residual mean square error (RMSE) of 0.9%. Moreover, the three species could also be differentiated by NIR spectroscopy with 100% accuracy, i.e. NIR spectroscopy is able to segregate timbers from mixed species forest plantations.

However, the response of extreme precipitation to global warming in various climates remains unclear. Here, we analyzed changes in the sensitivities of extreme and mean precipitation to temperature across the dry and wet regions of the world during 1960-1999 and 2060-2099 using global climate models. Both extreme and mean precipitation exhibited similar spatial patterns; however, the magnitude of sensitivity for extreme precipitation was approximately three times higher (19%/K) than for mean precipitation (6%/K). A higher precipitation sensitivity to temperature was observed in the dry regions than in the wet regions. Dry regions exhibited a four- to five-fold higher temperature sensitivity for mean precipitation, and marginally higher temperature sensitivity for extreme precipitation than wet regions. These findings highlight the importance of implementing adaptive strategies to alleviate the effects of global warming on dryland ecosystems.

We asked if the PRP could be reframed to encompass organisms both large and small. We used a synthetic review of recent advances in arid land microbial ecology combined with a mathematically explicit theoretical model. Preserving the PRPs core of adaptations by reserve building, the model considers differential organismal strategies to manage these reserves. It proposes a gradient of organisms according to their reserve strategies, from nimble responders (NIRs) to torpid responders (TORs). It predicts how organismal fitness depends on pulse regimes and reserve strategies, partially explaining organismal diversification and distributions. After accounting for scaling phenomena and redefining the microscale meaning of aridity, the evidence shows that the PRP is applicable to microbes. This modified PRP represents an inclusive theoretical framework working across life-forms, although direct testing is still needed.

The demand for functional foods is gradually increasing as living standards rise, and the output of minor cereals in China is increasing annually. The planting layout of naked oat is scattered and lacks planning, which seriously restricts the development of the naked oat industry. The increase in miscellaneous grain production will not only be impacted by cultivation methods and management techniques, but the potential impact of global climate change needs to be considered. North China is the main area for naked oat production, worldwide. MethodsIn this study, the potential distribution range of naked oat in North China was forecast based on historical distribution data and the Maxent model under climate change conditions. The performance of the model was relatively high. ResultsThe results indicated that the most suitable area for the potential geographic distribution of naked oat in North China was 27.89x104 km(2), including central and northeastern Shanxi, and northeastern and western Hebei and Beijing, gradually moving northward. The core suitable area increased, and the distribution of naked oat had an obvious regional response to climate warming; the main environmental factors affecting the potential geographic distribution were precipitation factor variables (precipitation seasonality (variation coefficient)), terrain factor variables (elevation) and temperature factor variables (temperature seasonality (Standard Deviation*100)). DiscussionIn this study, the Maxent model was used to analyze and predict suitable areas for naked oat in North China, and the distribution of suitable areas was accurately divided, and the main climatic factors affecting the distribution of naked oat were identified. This research provides data support and theoretical support for the optimal planting zone of naked oat in North China.

Direct and indirect effects of high temperatures on fledging in a cooperatively breeding bird	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY												High temperatures and low rainfall consistently constrain reproduction in arid-zone bird species. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this pattern is critical for predicting how climate change will influence population persistence and to inform conservation and management. In this study, we analyzed Southern Pied Babbler Turdoides bicolor nestling survival, daily growth rate and adult investment behavior during the nestling period over three austral summer breeding seasons. High temperatures were associated with lower body mass, shorter tarsi, and reduced daily growth rates of nestlings. Our piecewise structural equation models suggested that direct impacts of temperature had the strongest influence on nestling size and daily growth rates for both 5-day-old and 11-day-old nestlings, followed by temperature-related adjustments to provisioning rates by adults. Rainfall and group size influenced the behavior of provisioning adults but did not influence nestling growth or survival. Adjustments to adult provisioning strategies did not compensate for direct negative effects of high air temperatures on nestling size or daily growth rates. Detailed mechanistic data like these allow us to model the pathways by which high temperature causes nest failure. In turn, this could allow us to design targeted conservation action to effectively mitigate climate effects.

Price, Jodi; Tothmeresz, Bela			The present and future of grassland restoration	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Grasslands contribute greatly to biodiversity and human livelihoods; they support 70% of the world's agricultural area, but are heavily degraded by human land use. Grassland restoration research and management receives less attention than forests or freshwater habitats, although grasslands are critical for sustaining ecosystems multifunctionality and capacity to support biodiversity. In this article, we introduce a Special Issue which considers major trends and prospects in grassland restoration. We identified three key topics: First, restoration must confront widespread seed and site limitations, and new monitoring methods, including remote sensing techniques, are critical for restoration projects. Second, we highlight that restored grasslands typically require ongoing disturbance management and that research is required to determine optimal approaches for implementing this management during restoration. Third, global and regional restoration agendas should be harmonized with site-level goals, and syntheses of current knowledge and research needs must guide grassland restoration across scales. We also identify research gaps to be filled, and challenges which grasslands face in the future: (1) a need for careful target vegetation selection and climate-adaptive restoration; (2) lack of knowledge in dynamics and restoration of several regions and grassland types, including drylands and (sub)tropical regions; (3) increased importance of species arrival sequence, and high stochasticity of species establishment; and finally (4) issues of post-restoration management to guarantee long-term sustainability of restored sites.

However, how RFRH performs at improving the crop productivity and the economic benefits of long-term implementation are not known in different counties and conditions in the Loess Plateau region. Therefore, RFRH and traditional planting method (CK) experiments were carried out by us under five different hydro thermal conditions in the Loess Plateau for many years. The denitrification-decomposition (DNDC) model was corrected and verified by field test data. Then, the performance of RFRH and CK in time (from 1990 to 2019, three test points) and space (387 counties, 112,000 km(-2) grain crop planting area) was simulated. The results showed that from 1990 to 2019, the maize yield was 9200-11,395 kg ha(-1) under RFRH and 1433-11,326 kg ha(-1) under CK. The interannual variation in the maize yield was small under RFRH and it significantly improved the maize yield in dry years (87.0% higher than CK). In addition, RFRH effectively stabilized and improved the maize biomass (increased by 26.9%), harvest index (increased by 24.3%), and economic benefits (increased by 63.4%). In the whole Loess Plateau region, compared with CK, the average grain yield under RFRH increased by 86% and the average net income increased by 133%. The capacity of RFRH to increase the economic benefits in the Loess Plateau regions followed the order of: northwest region > northeast region > southwest region > southeast region. RFRH can improve and stabilize the maize yield, but also enhance the economic benefits of maize production in this region. Therefore, RFRH can be used as an important technique for coping with years when different amounts of precipitation occur in the Loess Plateau region, but especially in the northwest where the precipitation is limited.					li, bai/JNE-1502-2023	Wu, Peng/0000-0002-8549-9992													0378-3774	1873-2283				MAR 1	2022	261								107360	10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107360	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107360													WOS:000792810200001
J	Middleton, N; Tozer, P; Tozer, B				Middleton, Nick; Tozer, Peter; Tozer, Brenton			Sand and dust storms: underrated natural hazards	DISASTERS												Sand and dust storms (SDS) are wind erosion events typically associated with dryland regions, although they can occur in most environments and their impacts are frequently experienced outside drylands because desert dust haze often is transported great distances. SDS represent hazards to society in numerous ways, yet they do not feature prominently in the disasters literature. This paper considers SDS in a hazard context by examining their ramifications in economic, physical, and social terms, with a focus on agriculture, health, transport, utilities, households, and the commercial and manufacturing sector. There are few assessments of the economic consequences of SDS and those studies that have been conducted lack consistency in data collection methods and analysis. SDS do not result in the significant damage to infrastructure usually associated with many disasters, but the cumulative effects on society can be significant because SDS occur more commonly than most other types of natural hazard.

Soil organic carbon in drylands: shrub encroachment and vegetation management effects dwarf those of livestock grazing	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Dryland ecosystems occur worldwide and play a prominent, but potentially shifting, role in global biogeochemical cycling. Widespread woody plant proliferation, often associated with declines in palatable grasses, has jeopardized livestock production in drylands and prompted attempts to reduce woody cover by chemical or mechanical means. Woody encroachment also has the potential to significantly alter terrestrial carbon storage. However, little is known of the long-term biogeochemical consequences of woody encroachment in the broader context of its interaction with common dryland land uses, including "brush management" (woody plant clearing) and livestock grazing. Present assessments exhibit considerable variation in the consequences of these land use/land cover changes, with evidence that brush management may counteract sizeable impacts of shrub encroachment on soil biogeochemical pools. A challenge to assessing the net effects of brush management in shrub-encroached grasslands on soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (N) pools is that land management practices are typically considered in isolation, when they are co-occurring phenomena. Furthermore, few studies have assessed spatial patterns in brush management and how these are affected in decades following treatment on sites with contrasting grazing histories. To address these uncertainties and interactions, we quantified the impacts of shrub encroachment and their subsequent mortality resulting from brush management (herbicide application) on SOC and N pools in a Sonoran Desert grassland where long-term grazing manipulations (>100 yr) co-occur with shrub encroachment and brush management. Pools of SOC and N associated with herbicided shrubs declined markedly over similar to 40 yr, offsetting 66% of the increases from shrub encroachment. However, spatial patterns in SOC induced by shrubs persisted over the decades following brush management. Century-long protection from grazing did little to change SOC and N pools. Accordingly, shrub encroachment and shrub mortality from brush management each far outweighed livestock grazing impacts. Consideration of the patterns of SOC and N through space (e.g., bole-to-dripline gradients), time (e.g., shrub age/size), land use (e.g., livestock grazing and brush management), and their interactions will position us to improve predictions of SOC and N responses to land use/land cover change, inform C-based management decisions, and objectively evaluate trade-offs with other ecosystem services.

Unsustainable wood sourcing and inefficient carbonization result into negative environmental impacts. This action research aimed at building the capacity for sustainable charcoal production including `improving the traditional earth mound kiln (TEK) that is used by 99% of charcoal producers in Kenya. Small stems and branches of the invasive Prosopis juliflora were used and pro-duced quality charcoal with 28 kJ/g which will save trees. Improved earth mound kiln (IEK) increased charcoal yield by 49% per mass of sun dried wood fed into the kiln and reduced emissions of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons by 40%, 49% and 44% respectively. Net charcoal yield by a mass of dry wood in TEK and IEK was 26.4% and 28.4% respectively. Communication and capacity development on sustainable charcoal benefit people and environment. Studies on sustainable charcoal and effects on dryland socio-ecological systems will be needed.																			2667-3789					NOV	2023	19								200181	10.1016/j.rcradv.2023.200181	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rcradv.2023.200181													WOS:001090796700001

Methods: Eleven healthy men (23.2 +/- 1.5 years old) participated in this study. We measured the respiratory impedance assessed with the resistance at frequency of 5 Hz and 20 Hz, the reactance at frequency of 5 Hz, and frequency of resonance. To compare the influence of water depths, we carried out one dryland (DL) and two water level conditions: clavicle level (CL) and xiphoid appendix level (XA). Results: The respiratory resistance at frequency of 5 Hz was higher in CL and XA than DL, and at 20 Hz was significantly higher in CL than DL. The respiratory reactance at 5 Hz was lower in CL and XA than DL, and frequency of resonance was higher in CL and XA than DL. Conclusion: These results suggested that water immersion above xiphoid appendix level increase airway resistance.

This study aims to understand the complex scattering mechanisms occurring in similar structured crops and to discriminate pearl-millet crop using single date Radarsat-2 SAR data. The study arrived at few significant findings that the panicle stage isthe critical stage for discriminating pearl-millet from similar structured sorghum and maize crops. Alpha angle extracted from eigen-vector based decomposition was identified as the discriminating factor. Average alpha value almost reached 55 degrees due to dihedral scattering occurring in the prominent panicles which emerge early in pearl millet compared to maize and sorghum. Wishart H-A-alpha technique discriminated pearl millet, maize and sorghum crops with a producer's accuracy of about 87.8%, 71.6% and 71.4%, respectively. Paddy was classified with highest accuracy of 95.8% due to occurrence of dominant double bounce scattering in most of the fields.

Climate change impacts rainfall timing, which may alter the respective contributions of woody and herbaceous plants on the total vegetation production. Here, we apply 30 years of field-measured woody foliage and herbaceous mass from Senegal and document a faster increase in woody foliage mass (+17 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) as compared to herbaceous mass (+3 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)). Annual rainfall trends were partitioned into core wet-season rains (+0.7 mm yr(-1)), supporting a weak but periodic (5-year cycles) increase in herbaceous mass, and early/late rains (+2.1 mm yr(-1)), explaining the strongly increased woody foliage mass. Satellite observations confirm these findings for the majority of the Sahel, with total herbaceous/woody foliage mass increases by 6%/20%. We conclude that the rainfall recovery in the Sahel does not benefit herbaceous vegetation to the same extent as woody vegetation, presumably favoured by increased early/late rains.

The aim of the present study was to determine the optimal water-nitrogen (WN) coupling management strategy in an apple orchard in the Weibei Dryland, Shaanxi Province, China, under limited irrigation. A randomized complete block design was adopted to test the effects of three drip irrigation levels (W1, 300 m3/hm2; W2, 600 m3/hm2; W3, 900 m3/hm2) and four N application levels (N0, 0 kg/hm2; N1, 200 kg/hm2; N2, 400 kg/hm2; and N3, 600 kg/hm2) on N distribution in the 0-100 cm soil profile. Apple yield and economic benefits under different treatments were also evaluated over a three-year period (2012-2014). Compared with the N0W1 treatment, soil N contents were higher and exhibited distinct trends in the soil profile under other treatments. Overall, total N contents exhibited a downward trend from the surface to the subsurface layers (0.11-2.34 g/kg); however, the total N contents of the lower soil layer increased with an increase in irrigation amount. NO3-N contents were the lowest in the 40-60 cm soil layer and then increased with an increase in soil depth. The highest NO3-N contents of different soil layers were observed under the N3W3 treatment, ranging from 124.7 mg/kg (0-20 cm) to 90.9 mg/kg (80-100 cm). NH4+-N contents were low (<10 mg/kg), mainly accumulating in the surface layer and decreasing toward the deeper layers>20 cm. Different water-N coupling treatments also increased apple yield by 7.30%-41.62% when compared with the N0W1 treatment. The highest apple yield (three-year mean: 41.01 t/hm2) was observed under the N2W2 treatment, with an output value of 237 900 RMB yuan/hm2 and a net income of 232 000 RMB yuan/hm2. Considering fruit yield, partial productivity of N fertilizer, and economic and environmental benefits, the N2W2 treatment is the optimal water-N fertilizer coupling drip irrigation scheme for apple production in the study area and other similar dryland areas.																			1934-6344	1934-6352				SEP	2022	15	5					146	154		10.25165/j.ijabe.20221505.7257	http://dx.doi.org/10.25165/j.ijabe.20221505.7257													WOS:000885345000001

Soil and stand structure explain shrub mortality patterns following global change-type drought and extreme precipitation	ECOLOGY												The probability of extreme weather events is increasing, with the potential for widespread impacts to plants, plant communities, and ecosystems. Reports of drought-related tree mortality are becoming more frequent, and there is increasing evidence that drought accompanied by high temperatures is especially detrimental. Simultaneously, extreme large precipitation events have become more frequent over the past century. Water-limited ecosystems may be more vulnerable to these extreme events than other ecosystems, especially when pushed outside of their historical range of variability. However, drought-related mortality of shrubs-an important component of dryland vegetation-remains understudied relative to tree mortality. In 2014, a landscape-scale die-off of the widespread shrub, big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.), was reported in southwest Wyoming, following extreme hot and dry conditions in 2012 and extremely high precipitation in September of 2013. Here we examine how severe drought, extreme precipitation, soil texture and salinity, and shrub-stand characteristics contributed to this die-off event. At 98 plots within and around the die-off, we quantified big sagebrush mortality, characterized soil texture and salinity, and simulated soil-water conditions from 1916 to 2016 using an ecosystem water-balance model. We found that the extreme weather conditions alone did not explain patterns of big sagebrush mortality and did not result in extreme (historically unprecedented) soil-water conditions during the drought. Instead, plots with chronically dry soil conditions experienced greatest mortality following the global change-type (hot) drought in 2012. Furthermore, mortality was greater in locations with high potential run-on and low potential run-off where saturated soil conditions were simulated in September 2013, suggesting that extreme precipitation also played an important role in the die-off in these locations. In locations where drought alone contributed to mortality, stem density negatively impacted big sagebrush. In locations that may have been affected by both drought and saturation, however, mortality was greatest where stem density was lowest, suggesting that these locations may have already been less favorable to big sagebrush. Paradoxically, vulnerability to both extreme events (drought and saturation) was associated with finer-textured soils, and our results highlight the importance of soils in determining local variation of the vulnerability of dryland plants to extreme events.

BASED ON CONTINUOUS WAVELET ANALYSIS	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The variation in the plant nitrogen content (PNC) directly characterizes the growth of foxtail millet, and estimation of the PNC using hyperspectral techniques is important for effective evaluating the growth of this species. Effective statistical modeling methods can improve the accuracy and reliability of PNC estimates. In this study, field experiments were conducted under different gradients of organic fertilizer to develop an estimation model for determining the PNC in foxtail millet. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) was used to process the collected reflection spectra and construct partial least square regression (PLSR), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) estimation models. Among the common wavelet families, Daubechies (db5), Coiflets (coif3), Biorthogonal (bior1.5), Symlets (sym8), haar and rbio3.1 were selected to analyze the correlation with the PNC, and all the wavelet functions had a good correlation with the PNC. The correlation coefficients were 0.834, -0.835, -0.973, -0.784, -0.789 and -0.770, respectively. The CWT technique can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of the PNC. The best PNC estimate was obtained using db5 (R-cal(2) = 0.859, RMSEcal = 3.415), and the best decomposition scale was 2(4). In addition, the validation data indicate that db5-RF can be used to estimate the PNC (R-val(2) = 0.935, RMSEval = 1.311, RPDval = 3.32). This study provides a reference for the practical application of PNC analysis in foxtail millet.

This study aimed to investigate the association between dental caries (DC) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) among patients with type 2 DM (T2DM). A health center-based cross-sectional study was conducted comprising 91 eligible patients with T2DM (21 males and 70 females) with a mean age (+/- standard deviation) of 61.49 +/- 9.71 years. A structured interview, screening for DM-related factors, and oral examination were performed. Serum HbA1c levels were used as an index for glycemic control. A comparison between patients with controlled T2DM, i.e., HbA1c <= 7.0% (n = 46), and uncontrolled T2DM, i.e., HbA1c >7.0% (n = 45), showed significant differences in mean values of decayed teeth (DT) (P= 0.045); missing teeth (P = 0.002); and decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) index (P < 0.001). Results of multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the number of DT was significantly correlated with serum HbA1c levels (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.173 to 0.972, P = 0.005). Furthermore, DMFT index values and serum HbA1c levels (95% CI 0.532 to 1.658, P < 0.001) showed a significant association. This study provides substantial evidence on the association between DC indicators and serum HbA1c levels.

Using water balance simulation and two definitions of this value (time-based and volumetric ones), the reliability of rainwater harvesting systems for 25 locations in Medenine's dryland agricultural areas in south-eastern Tunisia is assessed. Extensive computer software was created using modelling idea for daily water balance, and three meteorological extremes, i.e. wet, average and dry years, were selected by analysing historical 20-year daily rainfall data to assess RWH system performance. Results stated that for wet climatic conditions, volumetric reliability of around 30-70% can be attained, whereas for these circumstances, only 10-24% time-based reliability can be accomplished. The method described in this article can also be applied to other arid and semi-arid areas by using daily rainfall data to predict water savings and the reliability of RWH systems.																			0097-8078	1608-344X				MAY	2021	48	3					361	367		10.1134/S0097807821030027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0097807821030027													WOS:000654315100004

A PRELIMINARY MOLECULAR PHYLOCENY FOR <i>STIRIA</i> (NOCTUIDAE, STIRIINAE) AND DESCRIPTION OF A NEW SPECIES FROM TEXAS	JOURNAL OF THE LEPIDOPTERISTS SOCIETY												Stiria comprises a group of 14 North American noctuid species that has radiated across the desert and dryland communities of Mexico and the southwestern United States. Stiria caterpillars are hostplant specialists, generally feeding on the flowers and seeds of a single or closely related species within the Asteraceae tribe Heliantheae. Their larvae exemplify the power of natural selection to shape and mold larval phenotypes across instars to match the developmental changes of their host flowers. We infer a preliminary molecular phylogeny for Stiria, describe Stiria brava sp. nov. from West Texas, and report six new larval hostplant associations for the genus. Identity of S. brava can reliably be determined by external adult morphology and COI haplotypes-but neither male or female genitalia provide definitive diagnostic features (across the genus).

Biomass can vary greatly at the ecological transition zone between grass dominated savannahs and the forest. It is not well understood if the transition zone could expand under climate change, and thereby reduce ecosystem stability and carbon storage in biomass. Here, we quantify such changes by using a high-resolution regional Earth system model under RCP 8.5 climate scenario. We disentangle the effects of climate, CO2, and land use by considering vegetation-climate feedbacks. Our results suggest that future climate change combined with elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration tends to induce a larger spatial gradient of ecosystem states, increasing the transition area by similar to 110% at the end of the century. Vegetation feedbacks generally amplify the climate effect by intensifying the climate-induced warming and drought, further enhancing spatial heterogeneity.

Two common mulching methods to conserve soil moisture, ridge furrows with plastic film mulching (RP) and flat soil surfaces with plastic film mulching (FP) are helpful for wheat production. Our previous study indicated that FP could improve wheat yield more effectively than RP, but the reason remains unclear. The effect of mulching method on functional bacteria also needs to be further studied. In this study, winter wheat was employed to evaluate the impacts of mulching method on soil temperature, moisture content, microorganisms and grain yield. The results showed that FP had a warming effect when the soil temperature was low and a cooling effect when the temperature was too high. However, the ability to regulate soil temperature in the RP method was unstable and varied with year. The lowest negative accumulated soil temperature was found in the FP treatment, which was 20-89 and 43-99% lower than that of the RP and flat sowing with non-film mulching control (NP) treatments, respectively. Deep soil moisture was better transferred to topsoil for wheat growth in the FP and RP treatments than the NP treatment, which made the topsoil moisture in the two treatments (especially FP) more sufficient than that in the NP treatment during the early growing stage of wheat. However, due to the limited water resources in the study area, there was almost no difference between treatments in topsoil water storage during the later stage. The wheat yield in the FP treatment was significantly higher, by 12-16 and 23-56%, respectively, than in the RP and NP treatments. Significant positive correlations were observed among the negative accumulated soil temperature, spike number and wheat yield. The Chao1 and Shannon indices in the RP treatment were 17 and 3.9% higher than those in the NP treatment, respectively. However, according to network relationship analysis, the interspecific relationships of bacteria were weakened in the RP treatment. Phosphorus solubilizing, ammonification and nitrification bacteria were more active in the RP than in the FP treatment, and microbes with nitrate reduction ability and plant pathogens were inhibited in the RP treatment, which improved nutrient availability and habitat for wheat.																			2095-3119					MAY	2023	22	5					1560	1573		10.1016/j.jia.2023.02.026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jia.2023.02.026		MAY 2023											WOS:001006996600001

Agricultural productivity and nutritional quality are both substantially threatened by extreme and unpredicted climate events. To develop climate resilient cultivars, stress tolerance along with the grain quality needs to be prioritized. Present study was planned to assess the effect of water limitation on seed quality in lentil, a cool season legume crop. A pot experiment was carried out with 20 diverse lentil genotypes grown under normal (80% field capacity) and limited (25% field capacity) soil moisture. Seed protein, Fe, Zn, phytate, protein and yield were recorded in both the conditions. Seed yield and weight were reduced by 38.9 and 12.1%, respectively, in response to stress. Seed protein, Fe, Zn, its availability as well as antioxidant properties also reduced considerably, while genotype dependent variation was noted with respect to seed size traits. Positive correlation was observed between seed yield and antioxidant activity, seed weight and Zn content and availability in stress. Based on principal component analysis and clustering, IG129185, IC559845, IC599829, IC282863, IC361417, IG334, IC560037, P8114 and L5126 were promising genotypes for seed size, Fe and protein content, while, FLIP-96-51, P3211 and IC398019 were promising for yield, Zn and antioxidant capacity. Identified lentil genotypes can be utilized as trait donors for quality improvement in lentil breeding.																			2296-861X					JUN 16	2023	10								1141040	10.3389/fnut.2023.1141040	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2023.1141040								37396135					WOS:001019007400001

Area of study: Shouyang County in Shanxi Province on the eastern Loess Plateau, China Material and methods: Eddy covariance system combined with micro-lysimeters and meteorological observing instruments were used in the field. The manual method was used to measure the green leaf area index (GLAI) during the growing season. Main results: In 2015 and 2016, the growing season ET accounted for 80% and 79% of annual ET, respectively. Soil evaporation (E) accounted for 36% and 33% of the growing season ET in 2015 and 2016, respectively. The daily crop coefficient increased with increasing GLAI until a threshold of similar to 3 m(2) m(-2) in the canopy-increasing stage, and decreased linearly with decreasing GLAI in the canopy-decreasing stage. At equivalent GLAI, daily basal crop coefficient and soil water evaporation coefficient were generally higher in the canopy-increasing and -decreasing stages, respectively. During the growing season, the most important factor controlling daily ET, T, and E was net radiation (R-n), followed by GLAI for daily ET and T, and soil water content at 10-cm depth for daily E; during the non-growing season, daily ET was mainly controlled by R-n. Research highlights: The daily crop coefficient and its components reacted differently to GLAI in the canopy-increasing and -decreasing stages.																			1695-971X	2171-9292					2020	18	4							e1205	10.5424/sjar/2020184-16370	http://dx.doi.org/10.5424/sjar/2020184-16370													WOS:000617035900009

In order to withstand these harsh conditions, plants have developed adaptive strategies and functional traits to survive. This study aims to evaluate the impact of three grazing regimes (grazing exclusion, seasonal and continuous grazing) on Stipa tenacissima L. functional traits, a dominant native and multi-use plant species, and its community. The findings suggest that the diversity of plant communities and traits of S. tenacissima are strongly affected by the management regime. Diversity is higher under seasonal grazing. Traits, such as leaf water content, specific leaf area and bio-volume are higher under seasonal grazing, compared with continuous grazing and/or sites fenced off to prevent grazing. Hence, seasonal grazing is recommended to maintain diversity of the plant community and to enhance the adaptation strategies of the local species under montane dryland conditions.

Scientific evidence for ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction	NATURE SUSTAINABILITY												Disaster risks are a critical area for research, but while the focus has been on man-made adaptation, this analysis of 529 studies compiles evidence for how ecosystems can mitigate hazard vulnerabilities. Ecosystems play a potentially important role in sustainably reducing the risk of disaster events worldwide. Yet, to date, there are few comprehensive studies that summarize the state of knowledge of ecosystem services and functions for disaster risk reduction. This paper builds scientific evidence through a review of 529 English-language articles published between 2000 and 2019. It catalogues the extent of knowledge on, and confidence in, ecosystems in reducing disaster risk. The data demonstrate robust links and cost-effectiveness between certain ecosystems in reducing specific hazards, something that was revealed to be particularly true for the role of vegetation in the stabilization of steep slopes. However, the published research was limited in geographic distribution and scope, with a concentration on urban areas of the Global North, with insufficient relevant research on coastal, dryland and watershed areas, especially in the Global South. Many types of ecosystem can provide sustainable and multifunctional approaches to disaster risk reduction. Yet, if they are to play a greater role, more attention is needed to fill research gaps and develop performance standards.

We collected opportunistic data on electrical conductivity (EC) and crown rot disease assessments in a replicated wheat germplasm field experiment at Nangeenan, a low rainfall area of Western Australia (WA). A positive correlation (r=0.63, P<0.001, df=28) was found between crown rot index and the composite measure of salinity, computed as the log(10) (product of EC values at depths). The simple linear relationship above can be further improved by fitting different intercepts and common slopes for each variety (adjusted R-2=0.54). These observations indicate that crown rot symptoms are more severe in saline soils and have implications for the practical advice given to growers as well as for the planning of research experiments on biotic and abiotic factors.

To restore degraded habitats under a facilitation framework, practitioners must correctly select both the benefactor (nurse) and the beneficiary (facilitated) species. Based on community assembly and species coexistence theory, we propose selecting plant species that largely differ in a suite of functional traits so that competition is minimized and facilitation maximized due to functional complementarity. To apply this guideline in a pilot restoration experiment performed in metalliferous mine tailings in South-Eastern Spain, we first built the plant-plant facilitative interaction network naturally occurring in a set of 12 tailings. After characterizing each species with 20 morphological and physiological traits, we verified that facilitative interactions were predominantly established between functionally distant species. Then, we designed a sowing experiment combining 50 nurse-facilitated species pairs separated by a wide range of functional distances. The success of seedling establishment significantly increased with the functional distance between the nurse and the facilitated plant species. Synthesis and applications. We encourage the use of ecological facilitation together with trait-based species selection to design restoration programmes based on the principle of increasing functional distance between target species. This method may not only promote the restoration of the plant cover but also impact paramount ecosystem functions, thus being an efficient low-cost restoration practice in abiotically stressful ecosystems.

Understanding farming systems and their economic performance in Telangana, India: Not all that glitters is gold	CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY												Farming systems are transitioning from a subsistence orientation to market orientation in response to changing food demands, technologies, and policies. In India's dryland regions, watershed development, among several other initiatives, has been a critical driver of these transitions, but their outcomes are poorly understood. The present paper investigates the characteristics and economic performance of current farming systems in a region in Telangana, India, that has undergone a rapid transition from subsistence orientation to market orientation. We surveyed 3006 farms, followed by a farm-economics study involving 75 households belonging to the three major farming systems. The gross margin was low for all systems but most inadequate for the crop-without-livestock system, highest for the crop-with-small-ruminants system, and intermediate for the crop-with-dairy system. Economic risks and natural-resource scarcity threaten the sustainability of current farming systems, and the reassessment of watershed development policies is recommended.

This study sought to compare the compositions and structures of the shrub-arboreal components of two Caatinga areas with different histories of anthropic disturbance in the Negreiros National Forest, Pernambuco State, Brazil. Twelve 4 x 50 m plots were established in each area, sampling all individuals >= 1 m tall with stem diameters at ground level >= 3 cm. A total of 34 species were sampled. The two areas had very distinct structures, with different dominant species: Croton blanchetianus, Poincianella pyramidalis, and Croton sp. in the conserved area; and Cnidoscolus quercifolius and Aspidosperma pyrifolium in the anthropogenically impacted area. The presence of cattle grazing appears to be negatively interfering with the recuperation of the anthropized area, which continues as a phytophysiognomically open site more than 30 years after discontinuing agricultural activities.

However, the response of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM), its related impact on terrestrial ecosystems, and associated forcing mechanisms remain controversial. Here we present a marine record of pollen-inferred vegetation changes suggesting that eastern India shifted from woody-savanna mosaics during Marine Isotopic Stage 3 to grasslands during the Last Glacial Maximum resulting from large-scale drying. Our data shows that ISM maximum is in phase with obliquity and precession maxima suggesting a dominant role of the Indian Ocean interhemispheric temperature gradient on glacial ISM variability. Persistent and abrupt dryland expansions of varying magnitude suggest rapid-scale onset of aridity during Heinrich Stadial events and during the Toba eruption. We propose that the amplitude of ISM drought events are initiated by high latitude and volcanic forcings, although modulated by precession.

The land use data from 1989 and 2002 became the model's base year, and 2019 served as the basis for testing the model's accuracy. According to the modelling results, there are several trends in land use change. Dryland agriculture expanded significantly, indicating an improvement in the pattern of agricultural land use.

The main objectives were to investigate the efficiency of different stability models for assessing GE interaction and to identify high-yielding and stable genotypes under diverse environments differing in water regime and climatic conditions. In this study, twenty-five durum wheat genotypes (breeding lines and new cultivars) were evaluated at six research stations, representing durum wheat growing regions, for three cropping seasons. After confirming significant GE interaction for grain yield, the phenotypic stability of durum wheat genotypes was analyzed by 34 different stability methods, as well as AMMI, GGE and Y x WAASB biplots methods. Estimation of stability indices, AMMI-based stability parameters, BLUP-based stability parameters (HMGV, RPGV, and HMRPGV), WAASB (Weighted Average of Absolute Scores from the singular value decomposition of the matrix of BLUPs) for the GE interaction effects and WAASBY (a combination of WAASB and yield) scores; and parametric and non-parametric stability methods for identifying high-yielding and stable genotypes were highlighted. The findings of this study suggest that some of the applied methods such as GGE biplot, AMMI2 biplot and Y x WAASB biplot are most advisable for enhancing selection of genotypes with high-yielding and stability performance in diverse environments. In addition, the stability methods of superiority index (Pi), geometric adaptability index (GAI), WASSBY, SIPCY (AMMIF + mean yield) and GGE distance (GGED) were significantly (P < 0.01) correlated with genotypic mean yields and can be successfully recommended to identify high-yielding and stable genotypes. Cluster analysis was applied to analyze the relationships between stability methods and genotypes simultaneously, which allowed to identify six groups of stability methods and four groups of genotypes differing in stability performance and adaptability. The applied methods resulted in identifying superior promising breeding lines i.e., G6, G20, G11, G10, G5 and G15 that out-yielded the national check varieties based on high-performing and stability. In conclusion, this study applied a complete set of univariate and multivariate models with a selection pattern based on each of model for classification and interpretation of GE interaction, which allowed the identification of efficient methods that towards selecting promising durum wheat breeding lines with high mean performance and greater phenotypic stability across the diverse rainfed conditions.

BIOLOGY-BASEL												Simple Summary Early leaf senescence is an important agronomic trait that affects crop yield and quality. To understand the molecular mechanism of early leaf senescence, a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) premature leaf senescence mutant (GSm) and its wild type were employed in this study. We compared the physiological characteristics and transcriptome of wheat leaves between the wild type (WT) and the mutant at two-time points. Physiological characteristics and differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis revealed many genes and metabolic pathways that were closely related to senescence. These results will not only support further gene cloning and functional analysis of GSm, but also facilitate the study of leaf senescence in wheat. Premature leaf senescence has a profound influence on crop yield and quality. Here, a stable premature senescence mutant (GSm) was obtained from the common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar Chang 6878 by mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate. The differences between the GSm mutant and its wild-type (WT) were analyzed in terms of yield characteristics, photosynthetic fluorescence indices, and senescence-related physiological parameters. RNA sequencing was used to reveal gene expression differences between GSm and WT. The results showed that the yield of GSm was considerably lower than that of WT. The net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, maximum quantum yield, non-photochemical quenching coefficient, photosynthetic electron transport rate, soluble protein, peroxidase activity, and catalase activity all remarkably decreased in flag leaves of GSm, whereas malondialdehyde content distinctively increased compared with those of WT. The analysis of differentially expressed genes indicated blockade of chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis, accelerated degradation of chlorophyll, and diminished photosynthetic capacity in mutant leaves; brassinolide might facilitate chlorophyll breakdown and consequently accelerate leaf senescence. NAC genes positively regulated the senescence process. Compared with NAC genes, expression of WRKY and MYB genes was induced earlier in the mutant possibly due to increased levels of reactive oxygen species and plant hormones (e.g., brassinolide, salicylic acid, and jasmonic acid), thereby accelerating leaf senescence. Furthermore, the antioxidant system played a role in minimizing oxidative damage in the mutant. These results provides novel insight into the molecular mechanisms of premature leaf senescence in crops.

The study was performed to provide a scientific basis for spring maize planting and environmental protection in this area. The four treatments were non-mulching (CK), plastic film-mulching during the growth period (PM1), plastic film-mulching during the fallow period (PM2), and straw-mulching (JM). After 13 years of continuous application, the yield of spring maize, the nitrogen uptake by plants, and the nitrate nitrogen content at the harvest stage were measured. The results revealed that soil moisture content and water storage capacity of the three soil-mulching treatments were all higher than those of the non-mulching treatment. Soil water storage at a depth of 0-300 cm in the JM, PM1 and PM2 treatments was increased by 11.8%, 10.6% and 8.8%, respectively, compared with the CK treatment. Compared with the CK treatment, the mulching treatments significantly increased the aboveground biomass and grain yield of spring maize. The yield enhancement effect of the PM1 treatment was the most significant, with a yield of 1.1 Mg ha(-1) and an increase of 26.72%. In addition to the JM treatment, the accumulation of soil nitrate at a depth of 0-300 cm in the PM1 and PM2 treatments was less than that of the CK treatment, but the largest increase in soil nitrate (80.20% in the JM treatment) was observed at a depth of 0-100 cm. The results suggest that in the rainfed agriculture in the southern Loess Plateau, mulching cultivation can effectively increase the soil moisture content and water storage capacity. PM1, and PM2 treatments could significantly reduce the content and accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in the deeper soil profile, and the three mulching measures could slow down the deep accumulation of soil nitrate nitrogen to a certain extent.

A comparison in species distribution model performance of succulents using key species and subsets of environmental predictors	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Identifying the environmental drivers of the global distribution of succulent plants using the Crassulacean acid metabolism pathway of photosynthesis has previously been investigated through ensemble-modeling of species delimiting the realized niche of the natural succulent biome. An alternative approach, which may provide further insight into the fundamental niche of succulent plants in the absence of dispersal limitation, is to model the distribution of selected species that are globally widespread and have become naturalized far beyond their native habitats. This could be of interest, for example, in defining areas that may be suitable for cultivation of alternative crops resilient to future climate change. We therefore explored the performance of climate-only species distribution models (SDMs) in predicting the drivers and distribution of two widespread CAM plants, Opuntia ficus-indica and Euphorbia tirucalli. Using two different algorithms and five predictor sets, we created distribution models for these exemplar species and produced an updated map of global inter-annual rainfall predictability. No single predictor set produced markedly more accurate models, with the basic bioclim-only predictor set marginally out-performing combinations with additional predictors. Minimum temperature of the coldest month was the single most important variable in determining spatial distribution, but additional predictors such as precipitation and inter-annual precipitation variability were also important in explaining the differences in spatial predictions between SDMs. When compared against previous projections, an a posteriori approach correctly does not predict distributions in areas of ecophysiological tolerance yet known absence (e.g., due to biotic competition). An updated map of inter-annual rainfall predictability has successfully identified regions known to be depauperate in succulent plants. High model performance metrics suggest that the majority of potentially suitable regions for these species are predicted by these models with a limited number of climate predictors, and there is no benefit in expanding model complexity and increasing the potential for overfitting.

Climate warming-induced drought stress and the duration of plant interactions may reshape or complicate this ecological process. However, little is known about how plant-plant interaction time (co-growth duration) combined with drought stress affect soil chemical properties and enzyme activities. In this study, Stipa bungeana and Bothriochloa ischaemum, which were the main plant species during the later stages of secondary succession in an abandoned cropland on the Loess Plateau of China, were planted as a single plant or in combination, in a plastic pot with two water regimes (ample water, 80 % of field capacity (FC); drought stress, 60 % of FC) for two consecutive years. The rhizosphere soil was collected each year to determine the nutrient contents and enzyme activities, and the microbial metabolic limitations were calculated. We found that plant-plant interactions, drought stress, and sampling year had a significant influence on most rhizosphere soil nutrient contents and enzyme activities. Redundancy analysis showed that soil pH, available phosphorus (aP), and total phosphorus had significant effects on soil enzyme activities in the first year, and soil total nitrogen and aP had significant effects on soil enzyme activities in the second year. Vector analysis indicated that drought stress increased microbial carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) limitation under each planting pattern, and these metabolic limitations showed a decreasing trend in the second year. An structural equation model demonstrated that plant-plant interactions on microbial C and P limitation were larger than drought stress in the first year. Conversely, in the second year, the plant-plant interactions on microbial C and P limitation were lower than that of drought stress. Our findings highlighted that the duration of plant-plant interactions had a significant influence on C flows and nutrient cycling in plant-soil systems, and improved the understanding of plant-plant interactions and drought stress on soil nutrient cycling and microbial metabolic limitations in vegetation restoration ecosystems.

Semi-arid savanna herbaceous production and diversity responses to interactive effects of drought, nitrogen deposition, and fire	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question Savannas are globally widespread and furnish a variety of ecological services through their structural heterogeneity. Unfortunately, those essential ecosystem services are threatened by climate changes including expected increases in duration of drought and nitrogen deposition. The objective of this study was to determine how overall herbaceous production, functional group production and diversity respond in the short-term to interactions between forecasted environmental conditions and prescribed fires. Location Western Edwards Plateau, Texas (latitude202f;31 degrees N, longitude 100 degrees W). Methods We randomly assigned full-factorial treatment combinations of rainout shelters, simulated nitrogen deposition and prescribed fires to field plots in an herbaceous-dominated area of a semi-arid savanna. Aboveground net primary productivity (assessed via destructive harvest) and diversity (using Shannon's index) were assessed as indicators of ecosystem functioning. Results Total aboveground net primary production was reduced by fire in the short-term (4 months), and reduced by drought at 8 months, but drought reductions were later overridden by lagged responses to large precipitation events (12 months). Forb production increased in response to nitrogen addition (8 months) and drought (12 months), but decreased as a result of fire (12 months). Live grass production was consistently reduced by drought. Plant species diversity was positively responsive to nitrogen addition, particularly in the absence of drought. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the concentrated precipitation events that are forecasted to follow extended droughts may aid rapid recovery of drought-induced production decreases. In addition, the small-scale diversity of this semi-arid savanna may be driven more by resource availability than light-competition in the short-term. Managers and ecologists can use these results to help disentangle the ecosystem functioning that may be observed in the presence of future droughts, nitrogen deposition and prescribed fire. Understanding these processes will be key to protecting the integrity of savannas.

However, it needs genetic improvement due to the presence of several anti-nutritional factors like the neurotoxic beta-N-oxalyl-L-alpha, beta-diaminopropionic acid (beta-ODAP), etc. To investigate beta-ODAP metabolism, quantitative real-time PCR would be a strong tool in gene expression analysis. Therefore, selection of reference genes in grass pea is necessary to get reliable and accurate results. In this study, eleven candidate reference genes, including 60SRP, ABCT, PP2C, IDE3, EF1 alpha, ElF1b, Fbox, GAPDH, HSP80, IF4 alpha and pUBQ were selected for identifying expression stability in different tissues under different developmental stages or drought stress. Expression stability was calculated using geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper separately, compared and ranked via RefFinder. The optimal number of reference genes required for normalization was determined by pairwise variation (Vn/Vn + 1) using geNorm. EF1 alpha and Elf1b were recommended as the most stable reference genes in drought stress tissues, whereas IF4 alpha, HSP80 and Elf1b exhibited the highest stability in developmental stage tissues and Elf1b, IF4 alpha and ABCT in total samples set. Moreover, two or more reference genes were recommended for qRT-PCR analysis under our experimental conditions. As the first report of reference gene evaluation in grass pea, our study will facilitate further studies in gene functions related to beta-ODAP metabolism and grass pea improvement.					ma, hao/GLS-6300-2022; liu, feng/HPC-8076-2023; wang, jiahui/IXD-1197-2023; wang, qi/ITT-9652-2023	ma, hao/0000-0002-3342-3099; xu, quanle/0000-0002-6303-7500													0925-9864	1573-5109				OCT	2022	69	7					2319	2330		10.1007/s10722-022-01374-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-022-01374-x		MAR 2022											WOS:000772960100001

Effects of low-cost agricultural technology package on income, cereal surplus production, household expenditure, and food security in the drylands of Mali	AIMS AGRICULTURE AND FOOD												This study assessed the effects of introducing a technology package consisting of seed priming and microdosing of mineral fertilizer on sorghum and pearl millet yield, cereal production, net value of cereal production, household expenditure, adoption rate of technology and household food security in the millet and sorghum producing areas in Mopti, Segou and Koulikoro regions of Mali. Three different surveys were undertaken to collect the data during the period from 2013 to 2015. The first survey assessed the farmers practices (360 households), the second survey assessed production, household expenditure and food security in the households (54 households) and the third survey assessed the adoption rates of the technologies (108 households). The surplus cereal production was in average 1155 kg/household for adopting households while non-adopting households had a surplus of only 196 kg/household. The monetary surplus increased from 31.2 Euro for non-adopting households to 215.6 Euro for adopting households. Households using the package spent 167.8 Euro on health, children's education, and other necessities while non-adopting households spent only 29.5 Euro. Furthermore, households using the package spent 55.9 Euro on fertilizer against close to zero for non-adopting households. Finally, the number of food insecure months were significantly reduced from 3.57 months for the adopting households to 1.24 months for non-adopting households. The technology package initiated positive development pathways characterized by increased production and income, surplus grain production, investments in livelihood assets and yield-enhancing technologies and improved food security. This link from technology introduction to improved food security is very important from a development perspective, but there is a lack of research that clearly demonstrate this effect in the drylands of West Africa. Future interventions to ensure a more broad-based development should focus on continued investment in yield-enhancing technologies, diversification of production to ensure better access to high quality food, strengthening the role of women, and building institutions to support farmers' livelihood and agency.																			2471-2086						2022	7	1					22	36		10.3934/agrfood.2022002	http://dx.doi.org/10.3934/agrfood.2022002													WOS:000743928900001

Increasing evidence has shown that recent TWS declines are substantial in ecologically fragile drylands, but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, by synergizing satellite observations and model simulations, we quantitatively attribute TWS trends during 2002-2016 in major climate zones to three mechanistic drivers: climate variability, climate change, and direct human activities. We reveal that climate variability had transitory and limited impacts (<20%), whereas warming-induced glacier loss and direct human activities dominate the TWS loss in humid regions (similar to 103%) and drylands (similar to 64%), respectively. In non-glacierized humid areas, climate variability generated regional water gains that offset synchronous TWS declines. Yet in drylands, TWS losses are enduring and more widespread with direct human activities, particularly unsustainable groundwater abstraction. Our findings highlight the substantive human footprints on the already vulnerable arid regions and an imperative need for improved dryland water conservation.

The results showed that the soil bulk density was the highest under no-tillage treatment. The maximum field water holding capacity and saturated water content were both the highest under deep-plowing treatment, which were 29.66 and 31.31%, respectively. Under the condition of balanced fertilization, during the growth period of maize, the average soil water storage of no-tillage and deep-plowing treatment was 44.2 and 34.6 mm higher than that of ploughing treatment. The yield, water use efficiency and net income of deep-plowing treatment with balanced fertilization were the highest among three combinations of tillage.

The research follows a historiographic line that highlights the impact of the conquest of al-Andalus by Christian kingdoms from the north of the Iberian Peninsula. It focuses especially on the modifications that the conquerors made to the Andalusian agrarian landscape, aimed chiefly at increasing production and feudal rents. The research methodology involved examining the documentation generated by the conquest, then comparing and contrasting it to archaeological survey work, field work and study of available maps. Agrarian spaces are identified and landscape features described, including networks of drainage canals, roads, a flour mill, caves, estates (mansi) and large meadows dotted with ponds and lagoons. The conquerors expanded the drainage infrastructure and divided the land into homogenous, but not necessarily contiguous, field systems with vineyards, green gardens, and plots for dryland agriculture.

Lacey			The historical context of contemporary climatic adaptation: a case study in the climatically dynamic and environmentally complex southwestern United States	ECOGRAPHY												The process of adaptation can be highly dependent upon historical and contemporary factors, especially in environmentally and topographically complex regions affected by Pleistocene glaciations. Here, we investigate Hilaria jamesii (Poaceae), a dryland C-4 graminoid, to test how patterns of adaptive genetic variation are linked to its glacial and post-glacial history. We show that the species persisted in a single, southern refugium during the last glacial period and subsequently migrated throughout its current distribution concurrent with post-glacial warming. The species' putative adaptive genetic variation correlates with climatic gradients (e.g. monsoon precipitation and mean diurnal temperature range) that covary with the species' probable route of demographic expansion. The short timescale and multiple climatic dimensions of adaptation imply that natural selection acted primarily upon standing genetic variation. These findings suggest that restoration and conservation practices should prioritize the maintenance of standing genetic variation to ensure that species have the capacity to respond to future environmental changes.

We reviewed scientific and 'grey' literature for the effects of enclosures on food security. Only 8% of the 114 reviewed scientific articles addressed food production, while 69% approached environmental parameters that indirectly affect food security, most of which had positive results. Thirty-one percent focused on social and economic impacts, land tenure conflicts and elite capture with negative connotations. The 'grey' literature showed an opposite balance between positive environmental views and negative socio-economic impacts. Enclosures are not a panacea for dryland development, but their use need to be recognized and understood. Multidisciplinary research and cooperation on the applied management of enclosures in the context of food security is highly needed. Furthermore, agro-pastoralist land-use practices need more policy space and practical management support, such as clear tenure legislation, agroforestry methodologies, and support in fodder production systems.					; Mureithi, Stephen M./H-3609-2019	Nyberg, Gert/0000-0003-1979-8772; Mureithi, Stephen M./0000-0002-2616-6995													1747-423X	1747-4248					2019	14	1					110	121		10.1080/1747423X.2019.1636147	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1747423X.2019.1636147		JUL 2019											WOS:000474282400001

Long Term Effect of Different Levels of Surface Crop Residue Application on Hydrolyzable and Non-Hydrolyzable Nitrogen Fractions in Sorghum (<i>Sorghum Bicolor (L.) Moench)</i> - Cowpea (<i>Vigna Unguiculata</i>) System in Rainfed Alfisols	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS												Soil nitrogen (N) fractions play an important role in contributing towards the availability pool of N in soil and thus enhancing the availability of N to the growing crops. Besides this, the distribution of these forms of N in soil also helps in understanding the conditions that control their availability to the crops. These fractions are relatively dynamic and respond more readily to the organic input like application of crop residue. Therefore, a long-term field experiment (2005-2012) was conducted at the ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, Hyderabad, India, for 8 years to assess evaluate the long term effect of graded levels of surface crop residue application under minimum tillage on the quantum of N fractions in soil and their quantitative relationship with crop yield and N uptake under sorghum-cowpea cropping system in rainfed semi-arid tropical (SAT) Alfisol. The results of the study indicated that the graded levels of surface residue application under minimum tillage significantly influenced most of the N fractions studied the except nitrate-N, unidentified-N and fixed NH4+-N. Among the inorganic N fractions studied, the exchangeable NH4+-N was significantly influenced by the residue treatments and it varied from 20.4 to 30.7 mg kg(-1), whereas the nitrate N was not influenced by the residue application and varied from 14.4 to 19.3 mg kg(-1) across the treatments. Among the surface crop residue application treatments, the use of crop residue at 6 t ha(-1) recorded significantly highest exchangeable NH4+-N (30.7 mg kg(-1)) as well as NO3-N (19.3 kg ha(-1)) followed by the treatment receiving sorghum residue at 4 t ha(-1) (28.1 and 17.8 kg ha(-1)). The total hydrolyzable N varied from 416.9 to 545.7 mg kg(-1) across the treatments. Among the total hydrolyzable N sub-fractions, the hydrolysable NH4+-N ranged from 53.3 to 71.7 mg kg(-1), hexosamine N ranged from 13.0 to 22.3 mg kg(-1), amino acid N ranged from 307.0 to 384.3 mg kg(-1) and unidentified N from 43.7 to 67.4 mg kg(-1) across the treatments and constituted 12.7%, 3.8%, 72%, and 11.5% of the total Hydrolysable N, respectively, in the soil. When these N fractions were regressed with the crop response parameters such as sorghum grain yield (Y-Sorghum yield), cowpea grain yield (Y-Cowpea yield), sorghum N uptake, (Y-Sorghum N uptake), cowpea N uptake (Y-Cowpea N uptake) and available N in soil (Y-Available N), the coefficients of multiple determinations (R-2) were found to be 0.833, 0.877, 0.961, 0.958 and 0.976, respectively, and were found to be significant (P = .05). The magnitude of significant coefficients of multiple determination (R-2) indicated the importance of these nitrogen fractions in soil in influencing the crop yields of sorghum and cowpea, total N uptake by the crops and nitrogen availability in the soil.

As one of the vital factors affecting vegetation structures, human activities have been widely explored in the literature. Nevertheless, the effects of spatiotemporal heterogeneity of human activities on veg-etation patterns are far from being well explained. Here, we address this issue by applying optimal control theory to the dryland vegetation-water model. We find that the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of human activities leads to the transition from different states to desired vegetation patterns, including the spot, labyrinth, and gap patterns, and thus increases the diversity of pattern structures. The heterogeneity in human activities is also found to promote the vegetation growth in low-rainfall areas, which in turn effectively prevents vegetation desertification. Our robustness analysis fully supports these findings. This work well quantitatively links human activities with ecosystems robustness and helps provide new insights for biodiversity conservation.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Using the example of rangelands in northern Baringo County, Kenya, that were under uniform pastoral use until the late twentieth century, we trace land-use and land-cover changes (LULCCs) since the 1980s. Based on ethnographic, historical, and remote sensing data, we show how bush encroachment and dryland farming have led to the increasing modification and conversion of formerly open rangelands and the diversification of livelihoods. These LULCC dynamics are related to and driven not only by internal processes of socioeconomic change (e.g., sedentarization, changing rangeland management practices, growing markets for small stock, increasing stratification and cultural differentiation) but also by ecological processes such as wildlife defaunation and ecological invasions. Based on our findings, we suggest that a socioecological approach to Kopytoff's notion of the internal African frontier can be helpful in framing these LULCC-related dynamics.

Following initial sowing rate at 4-6 kg/ha, these clovers produced seed yields up to similar to 2340 kg/ha for balansa and gland, 914 kg/ha for arrowleaf and similar to 814 kg/ha for Persian. After herbage was removed the clover seedlings that regenerated produced a maximum ground cover of 91% for balansa, 65% for gland, 17% for Persian and 6% for arrowleaf. The seeds of 'Mihi' Persian clover were all soft and none were recovered in the soil after three months of burial. In contrast, arrowleaf clover had the highest percentage of hardseededness (>97%) and therefore retained most of its viable seeds in the soil into the second year. The differences in hardseededness and regeneration potential mean different management strategies for their successful establishment into dryland farming systems.

FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Ecological indicators based on biodiversity metrics are valuable and cost-effective tools to quantify, track and understand the effects of climate change on ecosystems. Studying changes in these indicators along climatic gradients in space is a common approach to infer about potential impacts of climate change over time, overcoming the limitations of lack of sufficiently long time-series data. Here, we studied the response of complementary biodiversity metrics in plants: taxonomic diversity (species richness and Simpson index) and functional diversity (diversity and redundancy) in 113 sampling sites along a spatial aridity gradient (from 0.27 to 0.69 of aridity index-AI) of 700 km in a Tropical dry forest. We found different responses of taxonomic and functional diversity metrics to aridity. Species diversity showed a hump-shaped curve peaking at intermediate levels of aridity between 0.38 and 0.52 AI as an ecotone, probably because it is where most species, from both drier and more mesic environments, still find conditions to co-exist. Functional diversity showed a positive linear relation with increasing aridity, suggesting higher aridity favors drought-adapted species with diverse functional traits. In contrast, redundancy showed a negative linear relation with increasing aridity, indicating that drier sites have few species sharing the same functional traits and resource acquisition strategies. Thus, despite the increase in functional diversity toward drier sites, these communities are less resilient since they are composed of a small number of plant species with unique functions, increasing the chances that the loss of one of such "key species" could lead to the loss of key ecosystem functions. These findings show that the integration of complementary taxonomic and functional diversity metrics, beyond the individual response of each one, is essential for reliably tracking the impacts of climate change on ecosystems. This work also provides support to the use of these biodiversity metrics as ecological indicators of the potential impact of climate change on drylands over time.

To monitor ecosystem status and dynamics, aboveground biomass (AGB) is a good indicator, being a surrogate of many ecosystem functions and services and one of the main terrestrial carbon pools. Thus, accurate methodologies for AGB estimation are needed. This has been traditionally done by performing direct field measurements. However, field-based methods, such as biomass harvesting, are destructive, expensive, and time consuming and only provide punctual information, not being appropriate for large scale applications. Here, we propose a new non-destructive methodology for monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of AGB and green biomass (GB) of M. tenacissima L. plants by combining structural information obtained from terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) point clouds and spectral information. Our results demonstrate that the three volume measurement methods derived from the TLS point clouds tested (3D convex hull, voxel, and raster surface models) improved the results obtained by traditional field-based measurements. (Adjust-R-2 = 0.86-0.84 and RMSE = 927.3-960.2 g for AGB in OLS regressions and Adjust-R-2 = 0.93 and RMSE = 376.6-385.1 g for AGB in gradient boosting regression). Among the approaches, the voxel model at 5 cm of spatial resolution provided the best results; however, differences with the 3D convex hull and raster surface-based models were very small. We also found that by combining TLS AGB estimations with spectral information, green and dry biomass fraction can be accurately measured (Adjust-R-2 = 0.65-0.56 and RMSE = 149.96-166.87 g in OLS regressions and Adjust-R-2 = 0.96-0.97 and RMSE = 46.1-49.8 g in gradient boosting regression), which is critical in heterogeneous Mediterranean ecosystems in which AGB largely varies in response to climatic fluctuations. Thus, our results represent important progress for the measurement of M. tenacissima L. biomass and dynamics, providing a promising tool for calibration and validation of further studies aimed at developing new methodologies for AGB estimation at ecosystem regional scales.

However, there remains large uncertainty regarding impacts of mulching on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, especially under climate change (increases in air temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration and changes in precipitation). In this study, we applied a biogeochemical model, DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC), to predict impacts of different mulching practices on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) yields and N2O emissions under future climate scenarios in the South Loess Plateau of China. When tested against the observed crop yields and N(2)O( )emissions under no-mulching (NM), straw mulching (SM), and plastic film mulching (PM), DNDC successfully simulated crop yields and annual N2O emissions under all treatments. Simulations and observations both suggested that applying SM or PM increased crop yields and N2O emissions in comparison with NM. Sensitivity analyses of crop yields and N2O emissions indicated that the crop yields were primarily influenced by precipitation and N2O emissions were sensitive to changes in air temperature, precipitation, soil organic carbon, and nitrogen application rate. Application of SM or PM reduced the sensitivity of the crop yield and N2O emissions to precipitation change. Compared with historical climate conditions, future climate from 2017 to 2100 significantly increased crop yields except during the 2090s for NM or SM and during the 2070s to 2090s for PM under the high emission scenario (RCP8.5), while N2O emissions were increased under all treatments. The positive impacts of PM on crop yields could be reduced under the RCP8.5 scenario. The DNDC predictions suggest that straw mulching might be an optimum mulching method to improve crop productivity and mitigate increasing N2O under future climate conditions in semi-arid to sub-humid areas such as the South Loess Plateau of China.					, De Li Liu/Y-4656-2019; cheng, shu/IZE-4788-2023; zhao, ying/ISA-2502-2023; Deng, Jia/A-8468-2018	Deng, Jia/0000-0002-4794-053X; Zhao, Ying/0000-0003-0346-5631; Liu, De Li/0000-0003-2574-1908													0168-1923	1873-2240				APR 15	2019	268						86	97		10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.01.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.01.002													WOS:000460844700010

In this paper we provide new archaeobotanical and isotopic evidence for the agricultural systems and strategies that supported Shimao and nearby sites, from 5000 to 3000 BP. Our data show that the system gradually shifted from one based on common millet as the main staple-requiring a high level of labour-input-to a system dependent on extensive cultivation of foxtail millet, which is better suited to dryland cultivation in colder environments. We argue that this shift in cultivation coincided with regional climate change, and helped sustain early Bronze Age state societies, which fuelled the rapid emergence of social complexity in the semi-arid and arid area of the northern Loess Plateau from 4200 to 3000 BP.					zhang, pengcheng/B-2618-2008; Storozum, Michael/Q-4849-2017	zhang, pengcheng/0000-0002-4546-0022; Storozum, Michael/0000-0002-3948-6074; Sheng, Pengfei/0000-0002-7340-2882													1461-4103	1749-6314				2021 NOV 30	2021										10.1080/14614103.2021.2009995	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14614103.2021.2009995		NOV 2021											WOS:000723944800001

R.; Meron, Ehud			Linking spatial self-organization to community assembly and biodiversity	ELIFE												Temporal shifts to drier climates impose environmental stresses on plant communities that may result in community reassembly and threatened ecosystem services, but also may trigger self-organization in spatial patterns of biota and resources, which act to relax these stresses. The complex relationships between these counteracting processes - community reassembly and spatial self-organization - have hardly been studied. Using a spatio-temporal model of dryland plant communities and a trait-based approach, we study the response of such communities to increasing water-deficit stress. We first show that spatial patterning acts to reverse shifts from fast-growing species to stress-tolerant species, as well as to reverse functional-diversity loss. We then show that spatial self-organization buffers the impact of further stress on community structure. Finally, we identify multistability ranges of uniform and patterned community states and use them to propose forms of non-uniform ecosystem management that integrate the need for provisioning ecosystem services with the need to preserve community structure.

However, management decisions frequently ignore herbivore selectivity. Here, we studied how grass morphology controls sheep selectivity for individual plants, and how this selectivity interacts with grazing intensity to determine population plant-size distributions and the forage supply.In Patagonian steppes, we manipulated the plant morphology (size and standing-dead proportion) of three dominant grass species differentially preferred by sheep for 4 years. Then, we evaluated how these morphological alterations affected intra- and inter-specific preference patterns. We also evaluated how grazing intensity (ungrazed, moderate grazing and intensive grazing) affected the plant-size distribution of the three species, the forage supply, and its accessibility.For the highly preferred species, herbivores selected plants that were either naturally or experimentally short, with low proportion of standing-dead biomass. In contrast, morphological changes did not alter the within-species selectivity of the least preferred species.Grazing intensity strongly changed the population plant-size distribution of preferred species in ways that resembled the experimental manipulations of morphology. Moderate grazing showed the greatest morphological heterogeneity among individuals. When integrating the green biomass of forage species' individuals at ecosystem level, we found that the forage supply was the highest in ungrazed sites and decreased as grazing intensity increased. However, considering the dissuading effect of the standing-dead proportion of plants, the accessible forage was the highest under moderate grazing.Synthesis and applications. Our findings (i) showed that, within preferred species, sheep selectivity at individual-plant level is controlled by morphological characteristics that determine accessibility to green high-quality biomass. This effect was as important as that of species identity; (ii) empirically proved plant-animal positive feedback at individual level; and (iii) revealed how the individual-plant selectivity scales-up at population level and controls the forage supply, but also its accessibility. Our complementary approach generates critical knowledge for developing management practices to control key forage species defoliation and to adjust the grazing pressure to the offer of accessible forage, avoiding the common carrying capacity overestimation. These aspects are essential for sustainable production in grazed drylands.

Climate and tillage system drive weed communities' functional diversity in a Mediterranean cereal-legume rotation	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												The first step to develop an environmentally sound weed management is to know how weed communities respond to environmental drivers. Among these, climate and management practices are probably the more determinant factors for annual plants community assembly. In this framework, a trait based approach may be useful to assess weed community responses and the processes behind them. Here, we focused on three non-inversion tillage practices which differently affect soil conditions and the vertical distribution of weed seeds. We also took into account the climate variability across years. We specifically asked whether the type of non-inversion tillage system and the annual variability in climatic conditions explain the differences in the functional structure of weed communities. To assess this question we conducted a nine yearlong field experiment in which three non-inversion tillage systems were compared: subsoil tillage, minimum tillage and no-tillage. We characterized the functional structure of weed communities by first obtaining data on three resource acquisition traits (specific leaf area, plant height and growth habit) and five regenerative traits (seed weight, longevity index, dispersal structures, seed cover and emergence time). Then, we computed the community weighted mean (CWM) and the mean pairwise distance (MPD) of each trait as well as a multi trait MPD index. Climate annual conditions were characterized based on autumn-winter precipitation, average temperature and number of frost days. We found that tillage systems and climatic factors mainly sorted weed species according to their emergence time and seed weight. Weed communities from no-tillage plots were characterized by having an earlier emergence and seeds without pericarp. Regarding climatic conditions, we found that warmer and rainier autumn-winter conditions were related to lower functional diversity of regenerative traits and higher diversity in terms of resource acquisition traits. Our results highlight that factors affecting seedling emergence as well as traits related to these processes are critical during weed community assemblage. Our results also showed that none of the compared tillage systems was clearly outstanding in terms of functional diversity, but that each system benefited certain functional design. Furthermore, the relative importance of these management practices to drive weed functional structure was clearly lower than the effects of climatic inter-annual fluctuations.

Relative tolerance of photosystem II in spike, leaf, and stem of bread and durum wheat under desiccation	PHOTOSYNTHETICA												In dryland regions, soil moisture stress often leads to desiccation and causes injury to photosynthetic machinery. Recently, chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF)-based assessment of photosynthetic efficiency under drought stress is gaining attention due to advances in instrument development and methodology optimisation. Our study was designed to explore the use of spike photosynthetic efficiency as a trait to differentiate drought responses in wheat. Bread and durum wheat were assessed for spike, stem, and leaf tissue photosynthetic efficiency in response to progressive desiccation using ChlF imaging. Results showed that durum wheat had higher quantum efficiency and lower photoinhibition of PSII relative to bread wheat across spike, stem, and leaf. Rate of decline in maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII with increased desiccation was seen higher in bread wheat spikes as compared to durum wheat. Our investigation clearly demonstrated that ChlF imaging could be effectively deployed as phenotyping tool to differentiate wheat genotypes for their photosynthetic performance under desiccation.

Understanding the effects of specific genome regions on yield-related traits in founder variety derivatives can enable more efficient use of these genetic resources through molecular breeding. In this study, the genetic regions related to field grain number per spike (GNS) from the founder parent Linfen 5064 were analyzed using a doubled haploid (DH) population developed from a cross between Linfen 5064 and Nongda 3338. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for five spike-related traits over nine experimental locations/years were identified, namely, total spikelet number per spike (TSS), base sterile spikelet number per spike (BSSS), top sterile spikelet number per spike (TSSS), fertile spikelet number per spike (FSS), and GNS. A total of 13 stable QTL explaining 3.91-19.51% of the phenotypic variation were found. The effect of six of these QTL, Qtss. saw-2B. 1, Qtss. saw-2B. 2, Qtss. saw-3B, Qfss. saw-2B. 2, Qbsss. saw-5A. 1, and Qgns.saw-1A, were verified by another DH population (Linfen 5064/Jinmai 47), which showed extreme significance (P < 0.05) in more than three environments. No homologs of reported grain number-related from grass species were found in the physical regions of Qtss. saw-2B. 1 and Qtss. saw-3B, that indicating both of them are novel QTL, or possess novel-related genes. The positive alleles of Qtss.saw-2B.2 from Linfen 5064 have the larger effect on TSS (3.30%, 0.62) and have 66.89% in Chinese cultivars under longterm artificial selection. This study revealed three key regions for GNS in Linfen 5064 and provides insights into molecular marker-assisted breeding.																			1664-462X					JAN 5	2022	12								808136	10.3389/fpls.2021.808136	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.808136								35069666					WOS:000803651600001

Positive associations with native shrubs are intense and important for an exotic invader but not the native annual community across an aridity gradient	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim and Location Positive interactions influence the assembly of plant communities globally, particularly in stressful environments such as deserts. However, few studies have measured the intensity and relative importance of positive interactions involving native and invasive species along aridity gradients. These measures are essential for predicting how dryland communities will respond to biological invasions and environmental change. Here, we measured the intensity and importance of positive associations formed between native shrubs and the annual plant community, which included highly invasiveBromus madritensisssp.rubens("B. rubens") and native neighbours, along an aridity gradient across the Mojave and San Joaquin Deserts. Methods Along the gradient, we sampled metrics of abundance and performance for invasiveB. rubens, native annual species (pooled), exotic annual species (pooled) and all annual species (pooled) during peak flowering at 120 pairs of shrub and open microsites. Results Across the gradient,B. rubensoccurred at far greater abundance, cover, biomass and fitness near shrubs than away from shrubs. WhenLarrea tridentatawas the focal shrub, positive effects onB. rubensabundance and cover were least intense at the most arid sites under the shortest shrubs. The native annual community occurred at greater abundance, cover and species richnessawayfrom shrubs, regardless of relative aridity or shrub traits. Community-level species richness was greatest away from shrubs, but exotic species richness was similar in shrub and open microsites. Main conclusions Across two deserts,B. rubensformed intense and important positive associations with native shrubs that consistently improved its abundance, cover, biomass and fitness, and for abundance and cover, the intensity ofB. rubens-L. tridentataassociations depended upon relative aridity and shrub height. By strongly facilitating a dominant invader but not native- or community-level biodiversity, native shrubs provided the wrong kind of help to the annual plant community.

The objective of our study was, therefore, to identify the best combination of amendments that can improve soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) balances while maximizing utilization efficiency and profitability under teff cultivation. A field experiment was carried out for 2 years in the midland agroecology of Ethiopia. A total of 24 experimental plots were designed using RCBD with three replications. The treatments were PAM (40 kg ha(-1)), biochar (B = 8 t ha(-1)), lime (L = 4 t ha(-1)), gypsum (G = 5 t ha(-1)), PAM+B, PAM+L, PAM+G, and a control. N and P inflows from atmospheric deposition, biological fixation, and fertilizers; and outflows by water erosion, leaching, gaseous emissions, and harvested products were monitored in all plots via NUTrient MONitoring approach. Results showed that all the applied soil amendments improved nutrient balances (8-134%) compared with the control. Of the measured outflows, harvested products (43-60%) and water erosion (14-31%) were the major contributors to N depletion, followed by leaching (15-23%) and gaseous emissions (11-13%). Among the soil amendments, PAM+L appreciably reduced P loss from water erosion (61%); and N losses from erosion, leaching, and emissions by 55, 10, and 3%, respectively; and increased N use efficiency by 31% compared with the control. Moreover, PAM+L provided a net benefit much higher compared with others. Thus, application of PAM+L would be an effective strategy for sustainable agriculture, especially in acidic and degraded dryland areas.

Long-term conservation horticulture in mango orchards: comparative effects of conventional and conservation management practices on an Alfisol under seasonally dry tropical savanna climate	AGROCHIMICA												Conservation horticulture practices (CHP) is a new concept in the management of orchard soil health, reasonably over a long period under perennial horticultural systems. This paper reports the results of comprehensive investigations on Alfisol soil properties under conventional and CHP over nine years in dryland mango orchards. Effects of conservation tillage inter cropping and cover cropping on soil physical, chemical and biological health parameters were evaluated following standard methods of analysis. CHP improved soil quality by lowering the bulk density and enhancing the infiltration rate. Soil aggregate formation and water stability were enhanced in plots with conservation practices due to a higher production of glomalin compared to vegetable and orchard plots under conventional practices. Infiltration of water improved in CHP plots due to high organic matter content, lower bulk density and enhanced exchangeable basic cations. Microbial and biochemical properties significantly improved in plots with CHP over orchard plots with conventional practices. Legumes crops were more effective in improving soil quality than sweet potato.					AN, DrGaneshamurthy/CAJ-1611-2022	Rupa, Dr. T.

However, information about how long-term conservation tillage affects agroecosystem nitrogen balance in dryland winter wheat-summer maize cropping is limited. Based on a long-term (>9 yr) field tillage experiment and in-situ observation, we assessed the effects of different tillage practices (i.e., chisel plough tillage (CPT), zero tillage (ZT), and conventional ploughing tillage (PT)) on soil nitrogen balance and crop productivity in the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 growing seasons. Each tillage practice was exposed to a local widely adopted N application rate (240 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) in both seasons. Our results indicated that, compared with PT, CPT and ZT significantly (P < 0.05) reduced N2O emissions by 39.7% (2.8 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and 55.3% (3.9 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), and N leaching by 52.3% (11.8 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and 147.7% (33.3 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) across the two growing seasons, respectively. CPT significantly enhanced crop aboveground N uptake by 4.0%, and increased the annual crop yield by 5.9 -8.1% (0.8-1.2 t ha(-1) yr(-1)). Although CPT and ZT enhanced NH3 volatilization by 46.7% (14.6 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and 84.3% (26.3 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), the total N losses under CPT and ZT were decreased on an average by 7.4% and 22.4%, respectively. Overall, CPT and ZT significantly increased the accumulation of soil total nitrogen in the 0-100 cm layer by 34.8 and 54.1 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Taking N inputs and outputs together, CPT achieved a lower N surplus mainly due to increased crop N harvest and reduced N losses including gaseous emissions and hydrological leaching. Our findings suggest that long-term chisel plough tillage in dryland agroecosystems could serve as a promising soil management practice in increasing crop productivity and maintaining sustainability through enhancing N removal from crop biomass and decreasing N losses via N2O emission and nitrate-N leaching.

However, limited information is available regarding how different fertilizer application depths might affect crop production in dryland winter wheat-summer maize cropping in the Loess Plateau region of China. Therefore, we conducted field experiments in 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 to evaluate the effects of changing the fertilizer placement depth on summer maize (current crop) and winter wheat (succeeding crop) productivity, as well as the resource use efficiency and soil nitrate-nitrogen residue (SNR) level. Four fertilizer placement depths were tested comprising 5 cm (FD5), 15 cm (FD15), 25 cm (FD25), and 35 cm (FD35). The nitrogen uptake by summer maize in the two seasons was 10.0, 6.5, and 11.8% higher under FD15 compared with those under FD5, FD25, and FD35, respectively, because FD15 effectively increased the root length density, root surface area density, and rate of root bleeding sap. Due to the increased nitrogen uptake, the leaf area index, plant height, stem diameter, and accumulated dry matter were improved in summer maize. The interception of photosynthetically active radiation was 3.6, 3.7, and 5.9% higher under FD15 compared with those under FD5, FD25, and FD35, respectively. The summer maize grain yield increased by 13.9-22.4% under FD15 compared with the other treatments. In addition, the SNR in the deep soil (200-300 cm) was significantly lower under FD15 during the summer maize harvest (17.9-30.7%) compared with the other treatments. Moreover, FD15 increased the winter wheat (succeeding crop) grain yield (2.6-11.2%) and reduced the SNR in the 200-300 cm soil layer (8.8-16.8%) at the winter wheat harvest. The highest radiation use efficiency, precipitation use efficiency, and nitrogen use efficiency were obtained under FD15 in both summer maize and winter wheat. These results clearly suggest that depth fertilization of 15 cm enhanced the productivity and resource use efficiency for the current and subsequent crops in rainfed farmland in the Loess Plateau of China, as well as reducing the SNR in the deep soil to promote sustainable agricultural development. These findings provide a practical reference for optimizing fertilizer application management.

We assessed arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM) status of Faidherbia albida (Del.) A. Chev. trees grown on different land uses. We quantified the growth and nutrient uptake of F. albida seedlings inoculated with AM from different sources. These efforts were based on soil and fine root samples from the rhizosphere soils of F. albida trees. AM root colonization was determined using the gridline intersect method. Spores were extracted by the wet sieving and decanting method and identified to genus level. The seedling experiment had a completely randomized one-factorial design with four treatments and five replications. Faidherbida albida seedlings were grown in a greenhouse. All in situ F. albida trees were colonized by AM fungi. AM root colonization of F. albida trees was significantly higher (P < 0.0086) in area exclosures than on lands used for grazing or cultivation. Spore abundance was significantly higher (P < 0.0014) in area exclosures followed by cultivated land and grazing land. Glomus was the dominant genus in all land-uses. AM-inoculated F. albida seedlings grew better (P < 0.05) than non-inoculated controls. Seedlings inoculated with AM from area exclosure had significantly (P < 0.05) higher growth and nutrient uptake than those inoculated with AM from grazing and cultivated land. This emphasizes the importance of the native soil AM potential for better establishment of seedlings to achieve optimum plant growth improvement and assist in rehabilitation of degraded arid lands.

Using multiple proxies from satellite observations and model outputs, we show an overall increase (decrease) in vegetation growth (terrestrial water storages) across drylands globally during 1982-2016. Terrestrial water storages in greening drylands correlate negatively with vegetation growth, particularly for cropland-dominated regions, and such response is pronounced when the growth rate of vegetation productivity is high. Reduction in terrestrial water storage is dominated by precipitation and evapotranspiration variability rather by than runoff. We predict reduction in terrestrial water storage of 41-84% by 2100, accompanying expansion of drylands by 4.1-10.6%. Our findings, which indicate sustained adverse response of terrestrial water storage to vegetation growth in drylands, highlight the need for concerted planning for balanced ecological restoration, agricultural management, and water resource utilization that will affect 5.17 billion people, 64% of whom live in developing countries.

Using wastelands to grow crops in controlled greenhouse environments could improve global food security and preserve ecosystems. However, the impact of climate change on additional energy and water requirements of greenhousehorticulture food production is still unknown. Using a greenhouse simulator for four locations (The Netherlands, Spain, Saudi Arabia and Namibia), we show that a rise in outdoor temperatures can be counterbalanced with a more intensive water-based cooling. Between 6.9% and 17.9%, more water is required in the worst-case scenario in the year 2100, while the yield quantity decreases by 3%-6% due to slightly deteriorating growth conditions within the greenhouse. Since cooling systems consume up to 90% of the total water use in desert greenhouses, saltwater cooling could play an essential role in increasing the efficiency and sustainability of greenhouse horticulture systems in arid regions. In this study, we investigate the economic and technical feasibility of such greenhouse systems on a larger scale and show the massive potential of these systems. The developed scenarios demonstrate considerable climate resilience, enabling the cultivation of fresh vegetables in arid and infertile regions both presently and in the future.					; Tester, Mark/J-2368-2017; Leemans, Rik/A-1548-2009	Fleskens, Luuk/0000-0001-6843-0910; Tester, Mark/0000-0002-5085-8801; Leemans, Rik/0000-0002-4001-6301; Lefers, Ryan/0000-0001-7354-3370													2211-9124					SEP	2023	38								100701	10.1016/j.gfs.2023.100701	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gfs.2023.100701		AUG 2023											WOS:001060961700001

However, the stoichiometric responses of plants and soils along a chronosequence on the Loess Plateau of China has not been studied. In this study, we chose four stand ages (5-10 years old, YF; 10-20 years old, NF; 30 years old, MF; 40-50 years old, OF) of Robinia pseudoacacia and abandoned land (AC) as research subjects to illustrate the C:N:P stoichiometry interactions among soils, plant tissues (green leaves, leaf litter, and roots), and soil microbes. The results demonstrated that the soil organic C, total N, soil microbial biomass C (MBC), microbial biomass N (MBN), and microbial biomass P (MBP) contents increased significantly with afforestation age and reached a peak in the OF stand. The soil C:N ratio showed a significant increase from 9.2 to 13.1, while no significant differences were observed in the soil MBC:MBN ratios. Compared with the R. pseudoacacia forests, AC had the lowest soil C:N, N:P, and C:P ratios. Forest stand age had different influences on the C, N, and P contents in leaves, leaf litter, and fine roots. The most obvious trends were that the N contents in leaves and litter increased with stand age, indicating that old forests could accumulate more N in their leaves and litter. The leaf N:P ratio increased from 16 to 20 along the chronosequence, which demonstrated that P was the limiting element for the growth of R. pseudoacacia plantations on the Loess Plateau. The P demand increased with stand age. Therefore, our results indicated that R. pseudoacacia plantations enhance the C and N contents in soils and microbes in the first 30 years of growth and show an increasing demand for P over time. Therefore, attention should be paid to the application of phosphate fertilizer for the management of R. pseudoacacia plantations.																			0378-1127	1872-7042				NOV 1	2020	475								118394	10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118394	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118394													WOS:000581970500008

A two-year field experiment using C-13-labeled maize stem was carried out to quantify the allocation and dynamics of straw-C in an Entisol with and without plastic mulching. The results indicated that across the treatments, from 49.2% to 56.4% of straw-C-13 was released as CO2-C, from 34.9% to 43.1% was sequestrated as SOC pool, and from 6.7% to 9.7% remained undecomposed at the end of the experiment. Compared to non-mulching, plastic mulching significantly decreased the straw-derived CO2-C emissions by 14.6%, partially owing to the increased incorporation of straw-C into SOC pool. Across the treatments, the straw-derived MBC ranged from 14.4 to 147.9 mg C-13 kg(-1); and plastic mulching increased straw-derived MBC and microbial C use efficiency (CUE) of straw residue by 41.2% and 352% compared with non-mulching, respectively. The allocation dynamics of straw-C in each soil aggregate followed a sustained upward trend with time, while a significantly higher straw-C was incorporated into both macro- (> 0.25 mm) and micro-aggregates (025-0.053 mm) with plastic mulching. Compared to the non-mulching plastic mulching enhanced the inclusion of straw-C-13 in the chimerically more stable C fraction, especially at the late experimental period. We conclude that crop straw return combined with plastic mulching could improve SOC sequestration by enhancing microbial CUE, physical and chemical protection of straw-derived C in this dryland cropping system.

This strategy has been proposed to minimize the conservation cost of genetic resources while preserving maximum genetic diversity. This study aims to determine the genetic diversity and formation of mini-core collection at Dryland Agricultural Research Institute (DARI) using morpho-physiological traits in lattice square design during 2014-2016. To this end, we surveyed 121 barley genotypes received from the National Gene Bank of Iran under both irrigated and rainfed conditions. Next, using factorial analysis, the studied 17 variables were distributed into 5 factors under both irrigated conditions and 4 extracted factors under rainfed conditions. The correlation analysis indicated a statistically significant positive correlation between morpho-physiological traits and grain yield under both conditions. Overall, five independent factors could explain 74% of the changes in irrigated conditions, whereas 5 independent factors together could explain 76% of changes under rainfed conditions. The mini-core collections consisting of 22 and 20 specimens were identified. For this purpose, important traits under rainfed and irrigated conditions with similar diversity to the initial collection were used, respectively. The diversity evaluation parameters in the core collection [mean difference percentage (MD%), coincidence rate percentage (CR%), variance difference percentage (VD%), and variable rate percentage (VR%)] in both mini-collections revealed that the diversity was well preserved in the initial collection in terms of generated mini-core collections. Therefore, it can be concluded that the mini-core collection selected from the initial germplasm can be very important for breeders to perform genetic designs. Accordingly, they can improve and introduce high-yielding cultivars and genotypes and important breeding traits of barley under rainfed (including drought) conditions.																			0133-3720	1788-9170				2023 JUL 26	2023										10.1007/s42976-023-00415-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42976-023-00415-0		JUL 2023											WOS:001037104000001

When Is A Lineage A Species? A Case Study In <i>Myxacorys</i> gen. nov. (Synechococcales: Cyanobacteria) With The Description of Two New Species From The Americas<SUP>1</SUP>	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Soil cyanobacteria are crucial components of biological soil crusts and carry out many functions in dryland ecosystems. Despite this importance, their taxonomy and population genetics remain poorly known. We isolated 42 strains of simple filamentous cyanobacteria previously identified as Pseudophormidium hollerbachianum from 26 desert locations in the North and South America and characterized these strains using a total evidence approach, that is, using both morphological and molecular data to arrive at taxonomic decisions. Based on a phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, we propose and characterize Myxacorys gen. nov. with two new species Myxacorys chilensis, the generitype, and M. californica. We also found distinct 16S-23S ITS sequence variability within species in our dataset. Especially interesting was the presence of two distinct lineages of M. californica obtained from locations in close spatial proximity (within a few meters to kilometers from each other) suggesting niche differentiation. The detection of such unrecognized lineage-level variability in soil cyanobacteria has important implications for biocrust restoration practices and conservation efforts.

The present study used high performance liquid chromatography to analyze the lutein content of the Chinese wheat Mini Core Collection of 262 common wheats. In addition, the effects of water regime, accession type, release year, geographical origin, and the correlation of lutein content with various agronomic traits was examined. The lutein content among genotypes varied ten-fold, ranging from 0.87 to 8.90 mu g/g. Ten cultivars with an average content more than 5.0 mu g/g were identified as sources of the high lutein trait. Lutein content among different environments was significantly correlated and the genotype (G) and environment (E) response showed G > G x E > E with the effect of water level likely to be small. These results also demonstrated that the lutein content of Chinese wheat had not undergone extensive selection during the breeding process and was independent of accession type, plant habit, and grain color. However, lutein content was related to the geographical origin of accessions. Among ten agronomic traits evaluated, only grain related traits were associated with lutein content. These results provided essential information for breeding programs to improve the nutritional quality of wheat by enhancing lutein content.																			0733-5210	1095-9963				NOV	2022	108								103545	10.1016/j.jcs.2022.103545	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2022.103545		SEP 2022											WOS:000863116300003
J	Li, Q; Zhang, SQ				Li, Qiang; Zhang, Suiqi			Impacts of Recent Climate Change on Potato Yields at a Provincial Scale in Northwest China	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Understanding the effects of climate change on potato yield is vital for food security in northwest China. Based on the long-term data of yields and meteorology, this study analysed the impacts of recent climate change on potato yields at a provincial scale in northwest China. The first difference method was used to disentangle the contributions of climate change from the changes in potato yield in two consecutive years. The moving average method was used to decouple the climate-induced yield of potato. The results showed that the yield and planting area of potato from the period 1982 to 2015 increased markedly, with inter-annual fluctuations. The temperature increased significantly during the potato growing period in northwest China, while other climatic factors did not change significantly. Specifically, the changing trends in climatic factors varied among different provinces. The key meteorological factors limiting potato yield were temperature, precipitation and diurnal temperature range, varying in the different provinces. Potato yields in Gansu, Shaanxi, Ningxia and Xinjiang decreased by 127, 289, 199 and 339 kg ha(-1), respectively, for every 1 degrees C increase in daily maximum temperature. The potato yield in Xinjiang decreased by 583 kg ha(-1) for every 1 degrees C increase in daily minimum temperature. For every 100 mm increase in precipitation, the potato yields in Gansu, Qinghai and Ningxia increased by 250, 375 and 182 kg ha(-1), respectively. Combining the first difference method and the moving average method, precipitation was the dominant climatic factor affecting potato yield in rain-fed areas (Gansu, Qinghai and Ningxia). For areas with irrigation (Xinjiang) or relatively high rainfall (Shaanxi), maximum temperature was the deciding climatic factor affecting potato yield. Appropriate adaptation to climate change in the different regions will help to ensure potato production in northwest China.																				2073-4395				MAR	2020	10	3							426	10.3390/agronomy10030426	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10030426													WOS:000529377300112
J	Li, YP; Wang, J; Wen, SH; Shao, MA				Li, Yanpei; Wang, Jiao; Wen, Shuhai; Shao, Ming'an			Effects of different earthworm ecotypes on soil nutrients distribution under straw return management in a maize agroecosystem	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Earthworms are among the most common soil macrofauna taxa in cropland areas in the Loess Plateau and exert a large influence on soil nutrient cycling. The impacts of earthworms are related to the way different earthworm ecotypes process the soil. However, there are relatively few studies on the differing impacts of earthworm ecotypes on soil nutrient dynamics. Here we carried out a field plot experiment to explore the characteristics of soil nutrients, microbial populations, and enzyme activity subjected to two ecological groups (epigeic and epi-anecic) in a maize system under two typical straw return managements (straw mulching and incorporation). Epigeic (EP), epi-anecic (EN), and the combined presence of epigeic and epi-anecic earthworms (EM) increased soil nutrients, microbial populations, and enzyme activity and improved maize growth. Under the straw incorporation mode, the promotion effect of earthworm treatment shows: EM > EN > EP. Compared with CK, EM significantly increased the nutrient content of all soil layers, and the activities of invertase, urease, phosphatase, and catalase increased by 8.6%-38.5%, 5.8%-33.7%, 13.7%-32.4%, and 8.1%-36.2%, respectively. The abundance of soil bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi increased by 21.8%-37.7%, 11.7%-43.6%, and 46.2%-58.1%, respectively. Under straw mulching conditions, EP significantly increased the nutrient content, enzyme activity, and microbial content in the 0-10-cm soil layer. The results showed clear effects of the earthworm ecotype on soil fertility under different straw application methods. These findings are helpful for revealing the role of different earthworm ecotypes in the nutrient cycling processes of dryland farmland ecosystems.					wu, yunhui/JGD-6838-2023; Wang, lingyu/JLM-2013-2023; li, bo/JJC-2664-2023; wang, chen/JED-7289-2023; lin, qing/JED-5250-2023														1085-3278	1099-145X				AUG 15	2022	33	13					2327	2339		10.1002/ldr.4301	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4301		JUL 2022											WOS:000822631400001

Methods In this pot study, we planted Setaria viridis, Stipa bungeana, and Bothriochloa ischaemum, which are typical grass species on abandoned farmland, succeeded by grassland, in the Loess Plateau of China, under optimal soil water conditions and under water deficit (i.e., 80% and 60% of soil field capacity, respectively). Rhizosphere soil samples of the three grass species were collected after 76 days of growth, and 21 soil properties were determined as potential indicators of soil quality. Four rhizosphere soil quality indices (SQI) were computed using linear/nonlinear scoring functions and additive/weighted additive methods by the selected minimum dataset (MDS). Results L-leucine aminopeptidase, cellobiohydrolase, phenol oxidase, total phosphorus, available phosphorus, nitrate nitrogen, water-soluble nitrate nitrogen, and water-soluble ammonium nitrogen constituted the MDS for SQI calculation. The nonlinear weighted additive index best discriminated the effects of grass species under drought stress. Rhizosphere SQI did not significantly differ among the three grass species under optimal water conditions, but drought stress exerted a positive effect on rhizosphere SQI, which was significant for S. viridis. Conclusion Short-term drought stress increased rhizosphere SQI, especially at the preliminary succession stages. Furthermore, the relatively stable rhizosphere SQI of plant species at the later-successional stages suggests that the later-successional plant species resisted drought stress better; this aspect warrants further investigation.

Tree diversity in a human modified riparian forest landscape in semi-arid Kenya	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Riparian forests in tropical drylands support high biodiversity and provide crucial ecosystem services. Yet, fertile soil, water availability and trees as a source of charcoal and timber make them a favourable place for settlements and subsistence agriculture. The present study aimed at evaluating the floristic diversity of riparian forest remnants in semi-arid Kenya as a basis for developing conservation and management strategies. Plant diversity was assessed along the Nzeeu and Kalundu rivers in Kitui County, Eastern Province, where riparian forest patches were intermingled with agricultural and grazing lands and invasive thickets dominated by Lantana camara. Diameter at breast height (DBH) and height of woody species (DBH > 5 cm) were recorded in a total of 74 transects (50 m x 10 m) laid out perpendicular to the rivers on both sides at 300 m intervals. In each transect, the distribution of six land cover types was mapped out and the distance of each plant individual from the river bank was noted. Overall, 631 individuals were recorded representing 85 woody species, of which 12 were exotic timber and fruit trees. Human activities mostly reached within 10 m of the river margin; indigenous vegetation covered only 12% of the transect area but had 188 tree individuals and 49 tree species (including 3 exotics), whereas agricultural land had a mean cover of 52%, 168 individuals and 39 species, including 9 exotics. Ordination and multi-level pattern analysis showed that Euphorbia bicompacta Bruyns, endemic to Kenya, and Commiphora samharensis Schweinf. were characteristic of indigenous vegetation, whereas Acacia species dominated in invasive thicket, grazing land and agricultural land. Only two species, Shirakiopsis elliptica (Hochst.) Esser and Rauvolfia caffra Sond., were clearly associated with the river bank, while the others represented a mix of riparian species with a broader ecological amplitude and typical dryland species. The study highlights that the area still supports viable remnants of indigenous riparian vegetation, whereas tree diversity on agricultural land is strongly shaped by human preferences and shows lack of recruitment. Targeted management interventions could support the maintenance of indigenous tree diversity with positive effects for overall biodiversity, soil protection and livelihood diversification. For instance, it is recommended to facilitate natural tree regeneration and to plant a variety of indigenous tree species, especially on the river banks. Further research is necessary to assess the status of riparian vegetation along similar dryland rivers in Kenya and Africa to adequately manage these important areas for biodiversity and ecosystem services.

Pasture intensification in beef cattle production can affect methane emission intensity	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE												Increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from anthropogenic activities have contributed to global warming and consequently to climate change. Among all sources of emissions, the agricultural sector accounts for just under a quarter, mainly because of the intensification of food production systems necessary to supply the growing demand of the population. As ruminal fermentation is the largest source of methane emission in the livestock industry, emission by cattle has become the focus of studies. The aim of this study was to evaluate enteric methane emission and emission intensities of Nellore cattle at different ages submitted to levels of intensification of the grazing system. TWenty-four animals per cycle (age of 21.8 and 13.1 mo in cycles 1 and 2, respectively) were randomly distributed across different grazing systems: irrigated pasture with a high stocking rate (IHS), dryland pasture with a high stocking rate (DHS), recovering dryland pasture with a moderate stocking rate (DMS), and degraded pasture with a low stocking rate (DP). Methane emission was measured using the sulfur hexafluoride technique in each season of the cycle. Intensive systems provided higher yields of good-quality forage as well as superior animal performance when compared with DP. Methane yields were different between seasons and cycles. Methane emissions per average daily weight gain and dry matter digestible intake were different between treatments. Differences in the results were observed when they were analyzed per hectare, with the highest gain yield (P = 0.0134), stocking rate, weight gain, carcass production, and total methane emission (P < 0.0001) being found for the intensive systems. There were no differences in emissions per weight gain or carcass production between production systems, while a difference was observed between cycles (P = 0.0189 and P = 0.0255, respectively), resulting in lower emission intensities for younger animals. We conclude that more intensive systems resulted in a higher kilograms production of carcass per hectare; however, animals at 19 mo of age raised in the IHS and DMS systems had a lower emission intensity in kilogram of CO2-eq. per kilogram of carcass. Moderate intensification (DMS) using animals at about 19 mo of age might be an effective strategy to mitigate GHG emissions from Brazilian tropical pastures. Further studies are needed to understand the relationship between increasing productivity and decreasing environmental impacts, especially methane emission from ruminants.

J	Richards, RA; Cavanagh, CR; Riffkin, P				Richards, Richard A.; Cavanagh, Colin R.; Riffkin, Penny			Selection for erect canopy architecture can increase yield and biomass of spring wheat	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												In wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) canopy architecture influences light penetration into the canopy and radiation use efficiency particularly during the period between stem elongation and anthesis which is the critical time for the determination of yield. Despite large differences in canopy architecture among spring wheat genotypes, ranging from erectophile to planophile upper leaves, there is little prior evidence to suggest that selection for canopy architecture influences yield. In this study we evaluated the variation for canopy architecture in a 4-way MAGIC population (n= similar to 1000 lines) developed from 4 Australian commercial spring wheats and an 8-way MAGIC population (n = similar to 300 lines) developed from 3 Australian and 5 northern hemisphere commercial wheats. The 4-way population was grown at both an irrigated and a dryland site in southern New South Wales whereas the 8-way population was grown at the irrigated site. We also measured grain yield, plant height and crop development stage at the irrigated site. Using a smaller subset of lines which we grouped into either erectophile or planophile we studied how canopy architecture influences grain yield and associated yield traits (above-ground biomass (AGBM), harvest index, yield components, flowering time and height). The grain yield in the latter experiments varied from 5 to 6 t ha(-1). Averaged over two years and two sowing dates in each year lines that were erectophile yielded 13% more than the planophile lines and most of this yield advantage was associated with a higher AGBM (11%). Erectophile lines had 24% more grains per unit area but a 9% lower grain weight. Erectophile lines flowered 2 days later than planophile lines and they were 7 cm shorter. Lodging, although rare in these studies, was more evident in the planophile lines. In both MAGIC populations the most erectophile lines yielded 24% more grain than the most planophile lines. Mapping was conducted on the 1000 lines from the 4-way MAGIC population grown at the irrigated and the dryland site. It showed that genetic control of canopy architecture was complex but QTL were generally repeatable at both sites. Significant QTL were identified on most chromosomes. G x E was low for canopy architecture as the scores were repeatable across years (r(2) = 0.85). This trait opens the way to improve wheat yields via increasing crop biomass which in the past has been largely intractable in breeding programs.

J	Deng, N; Wang, HL; Hu, S; Jiao, JY				Deng, Na; Wang, Honglei; Hu, Shu; Jiao, Juying			Effects of Afforestation Restoration on Soil Potential N<sub>2</sub>O Emission and Denitrifying Bacteria After Farmland Abandonment in the Chinese Loess Plateau	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Denitrification is a critical component of soil nitrogen (N) cycling, including its role in the production and loss of nitrous oxide (N2O) from the soil system. However, restoration effects on the contribution of denitrification to soil N2O emissions, the abundance and diversity of denitrifying bacteria, and relationships among N2O emissions, soil properties, and denitrifying bacterial community composition remains poorly known. This is particularly true for fragile semiarid ecosystems. In order to address this knowledge gap, we utilized 42-year chronosequence of Robinia pseudoacacia plantations in the Chinese hilly gullied Loess Plateau. Soil potential N2O emission rates were measured using anaerobic incubation experiments. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing were used to reveal the abundance and community composition of denitrifying bacteria. In this study, the afforestation practices following farmland abandonment had a strong negative effect on soil potential N2O emission rates during the first 33 years. However, potential N2O emission rates steadily increased in 42 years of restoration, leading to enhanced potential risk of greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, active afforestation increased the abundance of denitrifying functional genes, and enhanced microbial biomass. Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were the dominant denitrifying bacterial phyla in the 0 to 33-years old sites, while the 42-years sites were dominated by Planctomycetes and Actinobacteria, implying that the restoration performed at these sites promoted soil microbial succession. Finally, correlation analyses revealed that soil organic carbon concentrations had the strongest relationship with potential N2O emission rates, followed by the abundance of the nosZ functional gene, bulk density, and the abundance of Bradyrhizobium and Variovorax across restoration stages. Taken together, our data suggest above-ground restoration of plant communities results in microbial community succession, improved soil quality, and significantly altered N2O emissions.																			1664-302X					FEB 19	2019	10								262	10.3389/fmicb.2019.00262	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00262								30837976					WOS:000458953200001

A dataset of driving-force evaluation indicators was constructed with nine indirect (elevation, temperature, road network, etc.) and four direct influencing factors (dryland, paddy field, woodland, grassland). Finally, we built the driving force analysis model of natural wetlands changes to quantitatively refine the contribution of different driving factors for natural wetlands' dynamic change by introducing the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) and extreme gradient boosting algorithm (XGBoost). The results showed that the total area of natural wetlands in the Northeast Plain of China increased by 32% from 1990 to 2020, mainly showing a first decline and then an increasing trend. Combined with the results of transfer intensity, we found that the substantial turn-out phenomenon of natural wetlands occurred in 2000-2005 and was mainly concentrated in the central and eastern parts of the Northeast Plain, while the substantial turn-in phenomenon of 2005-2010 was mainly located in the northeast of the study area. Compared with a traditional regression model, the SSA-XGBoost model not only weakened the multicollinearity of each driver but also significantly improved the generalization ability and interpretability of the model. The coefficient of determination (R2) of the SSA-XGBoost model exceeded 0.6 in both the natural wetland decline and rise cycles, which could effectively quantify the contribution of each driving factor. From the results of the model calculations, agricultural activities consisting of dryland and paddy fields during the entire cycle of natural wetland change were the main driving factors, with relative contributions of 18.59% and 15.40%, respectively. Both meteorological (temperature, precipitation) and topographic factors (elevation, slope) had a driving role in the spatiotemporal variation of natural wetlands. The gross domestic product (GDP) had the lowest contribution to natural wetlands' variation. This study provides a new method of quantitative analysis based on machine learning theory for determining the causes of natural wetland changes; it can be applied to large spatial scale areas, which is essential for a rapid monitoring of natural wetlands' resources and an accurate decision-making on the ecological environment's security.					wang, xu/IAN-4886-2023; Wang, Siyi/JNT-2690-2023	Bai, chenzhao/0000-0001-8549-3382														1424-8220				SEP	2023	23	17							7513	10.3390/s23177513	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s23177513								37687969					WOS:001062109000001

In this study, we developed a modified Shuttleworth-Wallace (SWm) model, a modified Priestley-Taylor (PTm) model, and a modified dual crop coefficient (DKm) model based on the characteristics of a rainfed spring maize cropland on the Loess Plateau. The estimated ET and its components by the three models were compared with the measured ET and its components using an eddy covariance system and microlysimeters. The results indicated that the three models performed well in estimating the 30 min ET and daily ET and its components during the growing seasons of the rainfed spring maize field in 2015 and 2016. The diurnal course of the measured 30 min ET was closest to that of the estimated 30 min ET from the DKm model, and this model performed best to estimate 30 min ET with a regression coefficient (b0) of 1.01 (R2 = 0.89) in 2015 and 0.97 (R2 = 0.88) in 2016. According to statistical analysis, the PTm model outperformed the other two modified models on estimating daily ET with b0 of 0.97 (R2 = 0.89) and 0.94 (R2 = 0.89) and daily plant transpiration (Tp) with b0 of 1.07 (R2 = 0.93) and 1.11 (R2 = 0.93) during the both growing seasons. The performance of the three modified models on daily soil evaporation (Es) was not as good as that of daily ET and Tp, and the DKm model performed best to reproduce daily Es with a b0 of 0.91 (R2 = 0.37) and 0.88 (R2 = 0.54) in 2015 and 2016, respectively. As the PTm model required the fewest input variables among the three modified models, this model was finally recommended for rainfed spring maize on the Loess Plateau, China.																			0168-1923	1873-2240				MAR 1	2023	330								109322	10.1016/j.agrformet.2023.109322	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2023.109322		JAN 2023											WOS:000961032100001

So far, there are some effects of FM on coupling mechanism water-carbon/nitrogen use in dry-farming agriculture, but it's still not clear. Therefore, this study of FM impacts on spring maize yield, evapotranspiration (ET), total nitrogen uptake (TNU) of above-ground parts and water use efficiency (WUE) are necessary. We conducted a meta-analysis of FM, including 108 studies in northwest China. Overall, FM significantly increased spring maize yield, ET, TNU and WUE by ca. 50.7%, 2.6%, 56.4% and 50.2%, respectively. When growth period rainfall (GPR) is between 200 and 400 mm, the effects of FM on yield, ET and TNU were the strongest, while at GPR < 200 mm, the effects of FM on WUE were the strongest. The effect sizes of FM on yield, TNU and WUE increased with the increase of altitude, while the maximum effect size of ET appeared in the range of 1000-2000 m. On the basis of FM, further increasing the plant density (at PD> 75000 plant ha-1) can also increase the yield, ET, TNU and WUE by ca. 61.8%, 7.3%, 80.2% and 54.7% respectively. The effect sizes of FM on yield, ET, TNU and WUE increased first and then decreased with the increase of total nitrogen amounts (TNA), and the maximum effect values appeared in the range of 200-300 kg ha-1. In conclusion, FM can improve the adaptation threshold of spring maize to drought and high altitude. Moreover, spring maize yield was mainly co-determined by growth period rainfall, altitude, planting density, total nitrogen application and other factors.

Exploring long-term variety performance trials to improve environment-specific genotype x management recommendations: A case-study for winter wheat	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												The complex and interactive effects of genotype (G), environment (E), and management (M) can be a barrier to the development of sound agronomic recommendations. We hypothesize that long-term variety performance trials (VPT) can be used to understand these effects and improve regional recommendations. Our objective was to explore long-term VPT data to improve management and variety-selection recommendations using winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the U.S. central Great Plains as a case-study. Data of grain yield, variety, and trial management were collected from 748 wheat VPT conducted in the states of Colorado, Kansas, and Oklahoma over nineteen harvest years (2000-2018) and 92 locations, resulting in 97,996 yield observations. Using 30-yr cumulative annual precipitation and growing degrees days, we partitioned the study region into 11 contiguous sub-regions, which we refer to as growing adaptation regions (GAR). We used variance component analysis, gradient boosted trees, and conditional inference trees to explore the management and variety trait effects within each GAR. For the variety trait analysis, the VPT dataset was reduced to account for varieties for which 17 agronomic traits and 11 disease/insect reaction ratings were available (65,264 yield observations). GAR accounted for 46 % of the total variation in grain yield, M for 32 %, residuals (including interactions) for 13 %, year for 7 %, and G for 2 %. Conditional inference trees identified interactions among management practices and their effects on yield within each GAR. For instance, water regime was the most important practice influencing wheat yield in the semi-arid western portion of the study region, followed by sowing date and fungicide. In dryland trials, there was typically an interaction between fungicide, sowing date, and tillage system, depending on GAR. Other management practices (e.g. dual-purpose management, crop rotation, and tillage practice) also significantly affected yield, depending on GAR. The main variety trait associated with increased yields depended on region and management combination. For instance, drought tolerance was the most important trait in dryland trials while stripe rust tolerance was more relevant in irrigated trials in the semi-arid region. In this research, we demonstrated an approach that uses widely available long-term VPT data to improve management and variety selection recommendations and can be used in other regions and crops for which long-term VPT data are available.

Farmers' acceptance of this is not high because of a lack of awareness, and, in the dryland farming region of the Longdong Loess Plateau in China, the lack of acceptance is due to the established use of the no-till operation. It is urgent to explore suitable tillage practices for maize (Zea mays L., Longdan No.8) planting in this area. The impact of tillage practices on the soil water content, soil temperature, field water consumption structure, yield, and water use efficiency (WUE) of maize was determined. Six tillage practices were implemented in 2021 and their effects were determined in 2021 and 2022, including conventional tillage with no straw (T), conventional tillage with straw incorporated (TS), subsoiling tillage with no straw (SST), subsoiling tillage with straw incorporated (SSTS), no-tillage with no straw (NT) and no-tillage with straw mulching (NTS). Over two years, compared to T, the soil volumetric water content (SWv) with SSTS was significantly increased in the 5-10 cm soil layer at the V12 (big flare stage of maize) stage in 2022. SSTS significantly reduced soil temperature (ST) in the 20 and 25 cm soil depths at the V12 stage, and in every soil layer of the R2 (grain-filling stage of maize) stage. SSTS significantly reduced soil evaporation during the growing season (Ec), and significantly increased crop transpiration (Tc) when compared to T. Compared with T, SST and SSTS significantly increased biomass yield (BY), by 29.7-32.1 and 41.2-53.5%, respectively, increased grain number per ear by 6.3-16.5 and 10.4-38.8%, respectively, improved grain yield (GY) by 4.9-6.9 and 6.2-13.7%, respectively; SSTS significantly increased WUE by 5.5-15.4%. The correlation between soil volumetric water content at the V12 stage and grain yield was highly significant; the ST at the R2 stage had a significant positive correlation with grain number per ear, GY, and BY. Therefore, subsoiling tillage with straw incorporated increased the soil moisture content and reduced the soil temperature, optimized the water consumption structure, and improved the effective utilization of soil water, resulting in the accumulation of a higher biomass yield, and increased the number of ears, obtaining a higher yield, and improved water use efficiency. Therefore, subsoiling tillage with straw incorporated is a suitable tillage practice in the dry farming area of Longdong Loess Plateau, China.

A rill flume experiment with non-erodible flume bed and small soil samples was conducted. Seven flow discharges and six steep slope gradients were combined to produce various flow hydraulics. The soil detachment capacity increases with the increase in slope gradient and flow discharge. The critical slope gradients of 21.26 and 26.79% cause the detachment capacity to increase at a slow pace. The soil detachment capacity can be defined by a power function of flow discharges and slopes. The contribution rates of slope gradient and flow discharge to soil detachment capacity are 42 and 54%, respectively. The soil detachment capacity increases with shear stress, stream power and unit stream power; the increase rates of these parameters are greater under gentle slopes than steep slopes. Stream power is the superior hydrodynamic parameter describing soil detachment capacity. The linear model equation of stream power is stable and reliable, which can accurately predict soil detachment capacity by rill flow on steep loessial hillslopes. This study can help to sufficiently clarify the dynamic mechanism of soil detachment and accurately predict soil detachment capacity for steep loessial hillslopes.					zhang, qingwei/T-2774-2019; Zhang, Qing/IZQ-5273-2023														0029-1277	2224-7955				FEB	2019	50	1					85	98		10.2166/nh.2018.037	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2018.037													WOS:000461090000006
J	An, JX; Gao, GY; Yuan, C; Pinos, J; Fu, BJ				An, Jinxia; Gao, Guangyao; Yuan, Chuan; Pinos, Juan; Fu, Bojie			Inter- and intra-event rainfall partitioning dynamics of two typical xerophytic shrubs in the Loess Plateau of China	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Rainfall is known as the main water replenishment in dryland ecosystems, and rainfall partitioning by vegetation reshapes the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of rainwater entry into the soil. The dynamics of rainfall partitioning have been extensively studied at the interevent scale, yet very few studies have explored its finer intraevent dynamics and the relating driving factors for shrubs. Here, we conducted a concurrent in-depth investigation of all rainfall partitioning components at inter- and intra-event scales for two typical xerophytic shrubs (Caragana korshinskii and Salix psammophila) in the Liudaogou catchment of the Loess Plateau, China. The event throughfall (TF), stemflow (SF), and interception loss (IC), and their temporal variations within the rainfall event, as well as the meteorological factors and vegetation characteristics, were systematically measured during the 2014-2015 rainy seasons. Our results showed that C. korshinskii had significantly higher SF percentage (9.2 %) and lower IC percentage (21.4 %) compared to S. psammophila (3.8 % and 29.5 %, respectively), but their TF percentages were not significantly different (69.4 % vs. 66.7 %). At the intra-event scale, TF and SF of S. psammophila were initiated (0.1 vs. 0.3 h and 0.7 vs. 0.8 h) and peaked (1.8 vs. 2.0 h and 2.1 vs. 2.2 h) more quickly, and TF of S. psammophila lasted longer (5.2 vs. 4.8 h) and delivered more intensely (4.3 vs. 3.8 mm h(-1)), whereas SF of C. korshinskii lasted longer (4.6 vs. 4.1 h) and delivered more intensely (753.8 vs. 471.2 mm h(-1)). For both shrubs, rainfall amount was the most significant factor influencing interevent rainfall partitioning, and rainfall intensity and duration controlled the intra-event TF and SF variables. The C. korshinskii with larger branch angle, more small branches, and smaller canopy area, has an advantage over S. psammophila to produce SF more efficiently. The S. psammophila has lower canopy water storage capacity to generate and peak TF and SF earlier, and it has larger aboveground biomass and total canopy water storage of individual plants to produce higher IC compared to C. korshinskii. These findings contribute to the fine characterization of shrub-dominated eco-hydrological processes, and improve the accuracy of water balance estimation in dryland ecosystems.

Herbicides such as metribuzin are commonly used to control weeds. However, wheat has a narrow safety margin against metribuzin. Standing crops such as wheat with weeds in the same field can also be killed by the same dose of metribuzin. Therefore, it is important to identify metribuzin resistance genes and understand the resistance mechanism in wheat for sustainable crop production. A previous study identified a significant metribuzin resistance wheat QTL, Qsns.uwa.4 A.2, explaining 69% of the phenotypic variance for metribuzin resistance.ResultsTwo NIL pairs with the most contrasting performance in the metribuzin treatment and different in genetic backgrounds were compared using RNA sequence analysis, identifying nine candidate genes underlying Qsns.uwa.4 A.2 responsible for metribuzin resistance. Quantitative RT-qPCR further validated the candidate genes, with TraesCS4A03G1099000 (nitrate excretion transporter), TraesCS4A03G1181300 (aspartyl protease), and TraesCS4A03G0741300 (glycine-rich proteins) identified as key factors for metribuzin resistance.ConclusionIdentified markers and key candidate genes can be used for selecting metribuzin resistance in wheat.

Current status of sheep farming in India	JOURNAL OF LIVESTOCK SCIENCE												Sheep, with multi-facet utility (for meat, wool, skin, dung, and to some extent milk) plays a significant part in the Indian agricultural economy. India is having the second greatest number of sheep & goat in the world after China and has indigenous breeds with good productivity. Sheep are better adapted to India's arid and semi-arid tropical zones with marginal and sub-marginal lands. Sheep are possibly the most ideal small ruminants to exploit the scant vegetation available in dryland environments through rangeland management and reseeded pastures. The sheep farming sector in India needs marketing infrastructure facilities for value addition such as meat processing, warehousing, cold storage, and refrigerated trucks and there is a notable shortage of public-private partnerships. However, being advanced in veterinary infrastructure at ground level, and the expanding demand for sheep-sourced products generates an untapped opportunity for the export & value-added products. The current paradigm change in government policies is enabling farmers to move to scientific sheep farming which can assist and boost the productivity and farmer's revenue in India.

J	Yang, K; Zhao, YG; Gao, LQ; Sun, H; Gu, KM				Yang, Kai; Zhao, Yunge; Gao, Liqian; Sun, Hui; Gu, Kangmin			Nonlinear response of hydrodynamic and soil erosive behaviors to biocrust coverage in drylands	GEODERMA												In dryland ecosystems, soil erosion poses severe threats to ecosystem productivity and human well-being. Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are ubiquitous living covers in these ecosystems and play an important role in soil stabilization and erosion prevention. However, the quantitative relationship between biocrust coverage and soil water erosion as well as the driving mechanism have not yet been fully discussed, which hinders the development of soil erosion models that consider the effect of biocrusts. Accordingly, we set up 19 biocrust plots (10 m x 2.1 m) with coverage ranging from 9.3% to 80.0% on the Loess Plateau of China and conducted a series of simulated rainfall experiments. The quantitative relationship between runoff and sediment yield and biocrust coverage was assessed, and further complex correlations among these variables were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). We found that (1) the runoff rates and sediment yield were significantly related to biocrust coverage. The runoff rates and sediment yield decreased with increasing biocrust coverage via a logarithmic function and an exponential function, respectively. The runoff rate and sediment yield rate from the plot with 9.3% biocrust coverage were 3.2 and 51.5 times higher, respectively, than those from the plot with 78.4% biocrust coverage. (2) The flow pattern and regime of overland flow were significantly affected by biocrust coverage. The overland flow was shifted from tranquil flow to supercritical flow when the biocrust coverage declined to 12.3%. The flow velocity, stream power, Darcy-Weisbach resistance coefficient, Froude number, and Reynolds number were strongly correlated with biocrust coverage (R-2 = 0.548-0.830). (3) Biocrust coverage both directly and indirectly affected sediment yield. The anchoring effect of biocrusts directly protected the surface soil from raindrop impacts and runoff scouring (direct effect = -0.59). Additionally, biocrust cover had an indirect negative effect (-0.38) on sediment yield by decreasing the flow velocity and runoff rate with path coefficients of -0.81 and -0.78, respectively. Our results confirm that soil hydrological and erosive behavior have nonlinear relationships with biocrust coverage at the hill-slope scale, and they also reveal that variation in biocrust coverage is one of the main driving factors affecting soil hydrological and erosive behaviors. These results would improve soil water erosion estimation on biocrust-covered slopes and provide guidance for revising soil erosion models to include the effectiveness of biocrusts.																			0016-7061	1872-6259				JAN 1	2022	405								115457	10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115457	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115457		SEP 2021											WOS:000703712100040
J	Sun, FH; Xiao, B; Kidron, GJ				Sun, Fuhai; Xiao, Bo; Kidron, Giora J.			Towards the influences of three types of biocrusts on soil water in drylands: Insights from horizontal infiltration and soil water retention	GEODERMA												As a "living skin " of soil in drylands, biocrusts possibly change the retention and movement of soil water, and thus critically influence hydrological and erosion processes as well as soil moisture regime. Contrary to vertical infiltration, little attention was paid to horizontal infiltration, which may provide important information on soil water diffusivity and sorptivity. In this study, the one-dimensional horizontal infiltration experiments for bare soil and three types of biocrusts (cyanobacterial, cyanobacterial-moss mixed, and moss crusts) were conducted with disturbed soil samples in a semiarid dryland. Undisturbed soil samples were also taken for each treatment, and their soil water retention capacity were determined in the laboratory. The substantial differences that were found were analyzed, and the differences were further validated through monitoring and comparing their in situ soil moisture regimes at depth of 0-20 cm. Our results showed that the three types of biocrusts had significantly lower constant infiltration rate (0.11 vs. 0.18 cm min(-1)) and infiltration water amount (6.75 vs. 10.01 cm) than bare soil, and their wetting front moved much slower (0.60 vs. 1.14 cm min(-1)) in comparison to bare soil, with bare soil > cyanobacterial crusts > cyanobacterial-moss mixed crusts > moss crusts. Total sorptivity of cyanobacterial, mixed, and moss crusts were 21%, 32%, and 53% lower than that of bare soil, respectively. More importantly, at the same level of water content, all crust types had lower water diffusivity, sorptivity, and conductivity than the bare soil, and exhibited a higher water content than bare soil at a same level of matric potential (across the range of -15,000-0 hPa), indicating an increase in water-holding capacity and water availability of the biocrusts in contrast to bare soil. Furthermore, the in-situ soil water content of all biocrusts increased on average by 30% at depth of 0-10 cm but decreased by 23% at 10-20 cm. Confirming the lower infiltrability and higher water-holding capacity of the biocrusts in comparison to bare soil, biocrusts increase surface soil water retention capacity and water availability at the surface, thus playing a vital role in reshaping the surface soil water balance, which subsequently may affect surface hydropedological and biochemical processes in drylands.

Little is known about changes in long-term micronutrient (Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn) concentrations in these systems. This study investigated changes in soil micronutrient concentrations over time in two long-term tillage and crop rotation experiments under furrow-irrigated cotton systems and a notill dryland cropping enterprise. The tillage practices that were investigated were maximum (disc to 0.2 m, chisel ploughing to 0.3 m followed by the construction of beds in 1 m spacings) and minimum (mulching cotton residues, followed by root cutting, incorporation of cotton stalks and bed renovation with a disc-hiller) tillage. Soil samples were analysed for diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) extractable micronutrients, x-ray fluorescence (XRF) total micronutrients, pH, and soil organic carbon (SOC). Both maximum and minimum tillage influenced topsoil distribution of DTPA-extractable Cu, Zn and Mn, with the greatest changes occurring in Mn concentration. Concentrations of Mn in the topsoil (0-0.15 m) during 2015 were higher than those in the subsoil (0.15-0.6 m) by 74 % with maximum tillage and 159 % with minimum tillage, suggesting greater stratification with the latter (28 mg kg-1 in topsoil vs 11 mg kg-1 in subsoil). Including wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) in cotton rotations increased DTPA-extractable Mn concentration. DTPA-extractable Mn was positively correlated with SOC in two experiments (P < 0.01) and DTPA Fe and pH were negatively correlated (P < 0.01). DTPA Zn concentrations under minimum-till cotton systems were stable over 18 years. DTPA Zn concentrations measured at 0.02 m increments suggested that soil below the fertiliser band depth (< 0.04 m) was potentially responsive to Zn application. Sampling in smaller depth increments in the topsoil (0.02 m increments in 0-0.1 m depth) more accurately identified micronutrient stratification and may improve management decisions when sowing. Our results indicated that managing soil pH and SOC in alkaline Vertisols under irrigated cotton systems was a more practical approach to address micronutrient availability than soil application of micronutrients. Future research should consider the implications of current agronomic practices in cotton production, such as the method and timing of nitrogen application as it influences changes in soil pH, which may impact micronutrient availability at critical crop growth stages.

We conducted a hydroponic cultivation study using different flow rates under light-emitting diode lighting to investigate plant growth, nutrient uptake, and root morphology under different flow rates. Swiss chard plants were grown hydroponically under four nutrient solution flow rates (2 L/min, 4 L/min, 6 L/min, and 8 L/min). After 21 days, harvested plants were analyzed for root and shoot fresh weight, root and shoot dry weight, root morphology, and root cellulose and hemicellulose content. We found that suitable flow rates, acting as a eustress, gave the roots appropriate mechanical stimulation to promote root growth, absorb more nutrients, and increase overall plant growth. Conversely, excess flow rates acted as a distress that caused the roots to become compact and inhibited root surface area and root growth. Excess flow rate thereby resulted in a lower root surface area that translated to reduced nutrient ion absorption and poorer plant growth compared with plans cultured under a suitable flow rate. Our results indicate that regulating flow rate can regulate plant thigmomorphogenesis and nutrient uptake, ultimately affecting hydroponic crop quality.

Seasonal variations in infiltrability of moss-dominated biocrusts on aeolian sand and loess soil in the Chinese Loess Plateau	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Biocrust effects on soil infiltration have attracted increasing attention in dryland ecosystems, but their seasonal variations in infiltrability have not yet been well understood. On the Chinese Loess Plateau, soil infiltrability indicated by saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) of biocrusts and bare soil, both on aeolian sand and loess soil, was determined by disc infiltrometer in late spring (SPR), midsummer (SUM), and early fall (FAL). Then their correlations with soil biological and physiochemical properties and water repellency index (RI) were analysed. The results showed that the biocrusts significantly decreased K-s both on sand during SPR, SUM, and FAL (by 43%, 66%, and 35%, respectively; P < .05) and on loess (by 42%, 92%, and 10%, respectively; P <.05). As compared with the bare soil, the decreased K-s in the biocrusted surfaces was mostly attributed to the microorganism biomass and also to the increasing content of fine particles and organic matter. Most importantly, both the biocrusts and bare soil exhibited significant (F >= 11.89, P <= .003) seasonal variations in K-s, but their patterns were quite different. Specifically, the K-s of bare soil gradually decreased from SPR to SUM (32% and 42% for sand and loess, respectively) and FAL (29% and 39%); the K-s of biocrusts also decreased from SPR to SUM (59% and 92%) but then increased in FAL (36% and 588%). Whereas the seasonal variations in K-s of the biocrusts were closely correlated with the seasonal variations in RI, the RI values were not high enough to point at hydrophobicity. Instead of that, the seasonal variations of K-s were principally explained by the changes in the crust biomass and possibly by the microbial exopolysaccharides. We conclude that the biocrusts significantly decreased soil infiltrability and exhibited a different seasonal variation pattern, which should be carefully considered in future analyses of hydropedological processes.

Aiming at improving the effectiveness of ecological footprint calculation (EFC) for dryland areas, this study has modified the methodology of EFC for drylands by incorporating both ecological and productive contributions from desert areas into the EFC process, including the net primary production, emissions from energy consumption, and contaminant discharge, as well as water resources use. The modified method of EFC for drylands involved some recalibrated equivalence factors for desert areas in the calculating process to determine the yield factors for each local administrative unit at prefecture level based on its net primary production (NPP). The results from this study revealed the following: (1) From 2009 to 2020, the average ecological deficit in Xinjiang Region was 16.172 global hectares per capita (gha/cap), with average human use of the desert at 0.22 gha/cap, representing approximately 1.41% of the total ecological footprint. The average biocapacity of desert was 0.12 gha/cap, accounting for approximately 6.73% of the total biocapacity. (2) During the same period, the ecological footprint exhibited an initial increasing trend followed by a subsequent decrease. The ecological biocapacity demonstrated a significant decreasing trend (p < 0.05). All prefectural administrative units within Xinjiang Region exhibited an ecological deficit from 2009 to 2020, whereas a desert ecological surplus occurred only in the Kyzylsu, Kashgar, and Hotan prefectures. (3) As the ecological deficit in Xinjiang was on an increasing trend, it is recommended that in these regions, replacing thermal power with wind and/or photovoltaic power might be a way out to alleviate much of the deficit, since it could reduce the ecological footprint by 8.44%, and would decrease the ecological deficit by benefiting from deserts' carbon reduction. Based on this study, we would like to advocate for optimizing the energy structure in regions with significant desert coverage and enhancing desert production through implementing ecological farming practices.

J	Chen, LL; Zhao, HS; Song, G; Liu, Y				Chen, Lili; Zhao, Hongsheng; Song, Ge; Liu, Ye			Optimization of cultivated land pattern for achieving cultivated land system security: A case study in Heilongjiang Province, China	LAND USE POLICY												The change of cultivated land pattern (CLP) has a significant impact on cultivated land system security (CLSS), and is the foundation of ensuring adequate provision of cultivated land, and the premise of achieving sustainable development of the society. While there is a lack of research on the CLP optimization with the goal of achieving CLSS, particularly lacking research that taking the main grain production areas at the provincial scale as a study area. Hence, taking Heilongjiang Province in China as the study area, this paper uses the regional interpolation of ArcGIS spatial analysis and Auto-Logistics method to diagnose the common driving factors of CLSS and CLP change, and further sets up different development scenarios with the goal of CLSS to carry out the study of CLP optimization through the introduction of Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model. The results showed that: Firstly, the dynamic changes of paddy field, dryland and cultivated land were the most intense in the eastern Sanjiang Plain, the second in the western Songnen Plain, the weakest in the north-south axis, and the changes of paddy field and dryland were more intense in the later period (2010-2015) than in the earlier period (1995-2010); Secondly, regional interpolation in ArcGIS and Auto-Logistics method can effectively and reasonably spatialize, and diagnose the key factors (terrain and geomorphology including elevation and slope, socio-economic (distance to residential area, agricultural three wastes index) and farmland productivity potential) which affect the change of CLSS and CLP; Thirdly, the Kappa test coefficient of CLP optimization based on FLUS model is 0.898, with good simulation accuracy, meaning the combination of Auto-logistic and FLUS can achieve high-precision simulation of CLP. The simulation results that under the integrated control scenarios of food security, ecological protection and economic development, the regional food security, ecological protection and economic development are considered comprehensively, and the contradictions among the three are coordinated, which is more reasonable and conducive to the improvement of CLSS. Fourthly, the policies on controlling the growth rate of paddy fields, rationally reducing rural residential areas and decreasing agricultural three wastes should be strengthened to implement the optimal CLP and improve CLSS. The results bestow convincing insights on decision-making for the implementation of the optimal distribution of cultivated land resources and the compilation of the national land space plan, and also provide an important reference for the study area to improve CLSS by optimizing CLP.

The current study was from two newly planted Leptospermum nitens sites, one with duplex soil and the other in deep sandy soil, in the low rainfall areas of the south-west of Western Australia, with the aim of identifying key soil parameters influencing the plantation's survival and growth. Electromagnetic induction (EMI) at different depths was used to investigate the possible impact of soil variability on the Leptospermum nitens plantations. Two EMI surveys were conducted at each site, at different times of the year, to account for soil moisture variability (relatively dry and wet conditions). A least-square inversion algorithm was used to determine true electrical conductivities at three different soil depths (0-0.5, 0.5-0.8, and 0.8-1.6 m) to produce quasi-3D maps of soil inverted electrical conductivity. Corresponding soil samples from each depth were used for the physico-chemical analysis of soil parameters and to develop laboratory-based electrical resistivity to soil volumetric moisture calibrations with R-2 values between 0.95 and 0.99. Shrub survival and growth (canopy diameter) were estimated using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images and machine learning. Comparing EMI soil mapping with UAV imagery results showed significantly greater shrub survival and growth (p < 0.001) in areas with higher ECa ranges of 12-24 mS m(-1) at the variable textured site and 6-9 mS m(-1) at the uniformly sandy site. Overall, the variable textured site, with an 82% survival rate, had a significantly higher shrub count and larger plants than the uniformly sandy site, with a 75% survival rate. A principal component analysis (PCA) identified inverted EC to be strongly correlated with soil moisture > pH > soil texture. Such soil mapping may be a robust and effective method for risk assessment of new shrub plantations.

However, the mechanisms of wide hybridization remain open because pre- and post-fertilization barriers limit the production and development of inter-subfamily/intergeneric zygotes, respectively. We examined hybridization between wheat and rice using an in vitro fertilization (IVF) system to bypass these barriers. Several gamete combinations of allopolyploid wheat-rice hybrid zygotes were successfully produced, and the developmental profiles of hybrid zygotes were analyzed. Hybrid zygotes derived from one rice egg cell and one wheat sperm cell ceased at the multicellular embryo-like structure stage. This developmental barrier was overcome by adding one wheat egg cell to the wheat-rice hybrid zygote. In the reciprocal combination, one wheat egg and one rice sperm cell, the resulting hybrid zygotes failed to divide. However, doubling the dosage of rice sperm cell allowed the hybrid zygotes to develop into plantlets. Rice chromosomes appeared to be progressively eliminated during the early developmental stage of these hybrid embryos, and c. 20% of regenerated plants showed abnormal morphology. These results suggest that hybrid breakdown can be overcome through optimization of gamete combinations, and the present hybrid will provide a new horizon for utilization of inter-subfamily genetic resources.					; Ishii, Takayoshi/C-4038-2019	Maryenti, Tety/0000-0002-0176-7583; Okamoto, Takashi/0000-0001-6531-210X; Ishii, Takayoshi/0000-0001-6370-3289													0028-646X	1469-8137				DEC	2021	232	6					2369	2383		10.1111/nph.17747	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.17747		OCT 2021						34545570					WOS:000704378000001

Systematic evaluation of walnut lipids has significance for the development of the nutritional and functional value of walnut. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography/Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Orbitrap HRMS) was used to characterize the lipids of walnut. A total of 525 lipids were detected and triacylglycerols (TG) (18:2/18:2/18:3) and diacylglycerols (DG) (18:2/18:2) were the main glycerolipids present. Essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid and linolenic acid, were the main DG and TG fatty acid chains. Many types of phospholipids were observed with phosphatidic acid being present in the highest concentration (5.58%). Using a combination of metabolome and transcriptome analysis, the present study mapped the main lipid metabolism pathway in walnut. These results may provide a theoretical basis for further study and specific gene targets to enable the development of walnut with increased oil content and modified fatty acid composition.																				1664-8021				SEP 3	2021	12								715731	10.3389/fgene.2021.715731	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.715731								34539744					WOS:000696710300001

Steven			Spatiotemporal Heterogeneity of Water Flowpaths Controls Dissolved Organic Carbon Sourcing in a Snow-Dominated, Headwater Catchment	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The non-uniform distribution of water in snowdrift-driven systems can lead to spatial heterogeneity in vegetative communities and soil development, as snowdrifts may locally increase weathering. The focus of this study is to understand the coupled hydrological and biogeochemical dynamics in a heterogeneous, snowdrift-dominated headwater catchment (Reynolds Mountain East, Reynolds Creek Critical Zone Observatory, Idaho, USA). We determine the sources and fluxes of stream water and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at this site, deducing likely flowpaths from hydrometric and hydrochemical signals of soil water, saprolite water, and groundwater measured through the snowmelt period and summer recession. We then interpret flowpaths using end-member mixing analysis in light of inferred subsurface structure derived from electrical resistivity and seismic velocity transects. Streamwater is sourced primarily from groundwater (averaging 25% of annual streamflow), snowmelt (50%), and water traveling along the saprolite/bedrock boundary (25%). The latter is comprised of the prior year's soil water, which accumulates DOC in the soil matrix through the summer before flushing to the saprolite during snowmelt. DOC indices suggest that it is sourced from terrestrial carbon, and derives originally from soil organic carbon (SOC) before flushing to the saprolite/bedrock boundary. Multiple subsurface regions in the catchment appear to contribute differentially to streamflow as the season progresses; sources shift from the saprolite/bedrock interface to deeper bedrock aquifers from the snowmelt period into summer. Unlike most studied catchments, lateral flow of soil water during the study year is not a primary source of streamflow. Instead, saprolite and groundwater act as integrators of soil water that flows vertically in this system. Our results do not support the flushing hypothesis as observed in similar systems and instead indicate that temporal variation in connectivity may cause the unexpected dilution behavior displayed by DOC in this catchment.

A series of experiments with six types of surface roughness, five types of rainfall intensity, ten types of grass cover density, and three types of grass-shrub communities were conducted to quantify the influence of surface roughness, rainfall intensity, and grass cover on alpha. These results confirmed that for smooth surfaces, there is a negative correlation between alpha and the slope gradient in a large slope gradient range of 0.087-0.4226. The low critical value of Re (Rel) that resulting the influence of Re on alpha is not significant may be less than 170. There was a significant negative correlation between alpha and roughness (p < 0.001). In addition, whether on a smooth or rough surface, the rainfall increased alpha. When the grass cover density (C) was smaller than 3.45%, alpha increased with an increase in C; when C was larger than 3.45%, alpha showed the opposite trend as C increased. This is because as C increased, us did not continue to decrease but increased slightly. In addition, the mean flow velocity decreased significantly. This leads to a decrease in alpha. The rainfall intensity, roughness, and grass cover density had significant effects on alpha. Finally, the prediction equation of alpha quantifying the influence of rainfall and roughness on alpha was obtained with a high R2 (0.84) and low RRMSE (14%). h is a significant parameter for predicting alpha under grass-cover conditions. The prediction equation of alpha quantifying the influence of grass cover on alpha was also obtained with a high R2 (0.87) and low RRMSE (13%). These equations should be further validated when applied beyond the scope of the conditions under which they were developed.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				NOV	2022	218								106576	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106576	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106576		AUG 2022											WOS:000863342200001

Despite this importance, there is still uncertainty about global forest cover, particularly in drylands. Recently, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) conducted a costly global assessment of dryland forest cover through the visual interpretation of orthoimages using the Collect Earth software, involving hundreds of operators from around the world. Our study proposes a new automatic method for estimating tree cover using artificial intelligence and free orthoimages. Our results show that our tree cover classification model, based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), is 23% more accurate than the manual visual interpretation used by FAO, reaching up to 79% overall accuracy. The smallest differences between the two methods occurred in the driest regions, but disagreement increased with the percentage of tree cover. The application of CNNs could be used to improve and reduce the cost of tree cover maps from the local to the global scale, with broad implications for research and management.

Methods: To study the effects of farming systems on accumulation and distribution of agricultural plastic debris, research was carried out on two farming systems in Northwest China. Farming in Wutong Village (S1) is characterized by small plots and low-intensity machine tillage while farming in Shihezi (S2) is characterized by large plots and high-intensity machine tillage. In September 2017, we selected six fields in Si, three fields with 6-8 years of continuous plastic mulching (CM) as well as three fields with over 30 years of intermittent mulching (IM). In S2, we selected five cotton fields with 6, 7, 8, 15 and 18 years of continuous mulching. In both regions, MaPs and MiPs from soil surface to 30 cm depth (0-30 cm) were sampled. Results: The results showed that in Si, MaPs mass in fields with 6-8 years CM (i.e., 97.4kg.ha(-1)) were significantly higher than in fields with 30 years IM (i.e., 53.7 kg.ha(-1)). MaPs in size category of 10-50 cm(2) accounted for 46.9% in fields of CM and 44.5% in fields of IM of total collected MaPs number. In S2, MaPs mass ranged from 43.5 kg.ha(-1) to 148 kg.ha(-1). MaPs in size category of 2-10 cm(2) account for 41.1% of total collected MaPs number while 0.25-2 cm(2) accounted for 40.6%. MiPs in S1 were mainly detected in fields with over 30 years of intermittent mulching (up to 2,200 particles.kg(-1) soil), whereas in S2 were detected in all fields (up to 900 particles.kg(-1) soil). The results indicated farming systems could substantially affect the accumulation and distribution of agricultural plastic debris. Continuous plastic mulching could accumulate higher amount of MaPs than intermittent plastic mulching. High-intensity machine tillage could lead to higher fragmentation of MaPs and more severe MiPs pollution. These results suggest that agricultural plastic regulations are needed.

Our objective is to investigate the direction, extent, and spatial variation of land cover change at three administrative levels over three decades (1990-2020). We selected three provinces from each country (Aktobe, Akmola, and Almaty province in Kazakhstan, and Arkhangai, Tov, and Dornod in Mongolia) to classify the land cover into forest, grassland, cropland, barren, and water. Altogether, 6964 Landsat images were used in pixel-based classification method with random forest model for image processing. Six thousand training data points (300 training points x 5 classes x 4 periods) for each province were collected for classification and change detection. Land cover changes at decadal and over the entire study period for five land cover classes were quantified at the country, provincial, and county level. High classification accuracy indicates localized land cover classification have an edge over the latest global land cover product and reveal fine differences in landscape composition. The vast steppe landscapes in these two countries are dominated by grasslands of 91.5% for Dornod in Mongolia and 74.7% for Aktobe in Kazakhstan during the 30-year study period. The most common land cover conversion was grassland to cropland. The cyclic land cover conversions between grassland and cropland reflect the impacts of the Soviet Union's largest reclamation campaign of the 20th century in Kazakhstan and the Atar-3 agriculture re-development in Mongolia. Kazakhstan experienced a higher rate of land cover change over a larger extent of land area than Mongolia. The spatial distribution of land use intensity indicates that land use hotspots are largely influenced by policy and its shifts. Future research based on these large-scale land use and land cover changes should be focused the corresponding ecosystem and society functions.					kolluru, venkatesh/AAZ-2114-2021; Ochirbat, Batkhishig/G-2029-2014; Chen, Jiquan/D-1955-2009; John, Ranjeet/Z-1070-2019	kolluru, venkatesh/0000-0002-2110-5560; Ochirbat, Batkhishig/0000-0001-6012-0395; Chen, Jiquan/0000-0003-0761-9458; saraf, sakshi/0000-0002-6785-8381; Yuan, Jing/0000-0003-3077-2151; Sciusco, Pietro/0000-0001-7640-4472; John, Ranjeet/0000-0002-0150-8450														2072-4292				APR	2022	14	8							1805	10.3390/rs14081805	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14081805													WOS:000787410800001

Biocrust organisms are only intermittently metabolically active, but due to their ubiquity they make a significant contribution to the carbon cycle. Quantification of the controls and insights into the interlinked process of photosynthesis and respiration are essential to enhancing our understanding of the carbon cycle in the world's drylands. Yet, there have been relatively few field studies investigating controls on both biocrust photosynthesis and respiration. We undertook field-based experiments at two dune sites during the dry season in Diamantina National Park in Queensland, Australia to determine how biocrust hydration and illumination affect soil CO2 flux and photosynthesis. Static chambers and an infra-red gas analyser were used to quantify soil CO2 flux, and a fluorometer and a CFlmager were used to determine a range of photosynthetic parameters in the field and laboratory respectively. When dry, biocrust photosynthetic activity was not detected and soil CO2 flux was very low irrespective of biocrust cover. Hydration led to a large and immediate increase in CO2 flux, which was more pronounced in the presence of biocrusts and on the dune with thinner biocrusts. Hydration also initiated the onset of photosynthesis in some biocrusts, which was greatest under low light conditions and sustained with further hydration. There were only infrequent periods of net CO2 uptake to the soil, occurring when CO2 uptake due to photosynthetic activity was less than background soil CO2 flux. Chlorophyll fluorescence imaging indicated biocrust spatial heterogeneity was evident at the cm scale where microtopography creates a myriad of environments for different crust organisms. Our findings demonstrate that biocrusts are highly spatially heterogenetic at both landscape and small scale, which suggests the maintenance of biocrust spatial diversity is likely to be key to imparting resilience to changing climate and disturbance. As well as reaffirming the importance of biocrusts for the carbon cycle in dryland dune soils the study demonstrates that biocrust respiration and photosynthesis respond differently to hydration and shading. This adds an unpredictability to the distribution of soil carbon stocks and the gaseous exchanges of CO2 between the surface and atmosphere. Future changes to precipitation and increased temperatures are likely to reduce soil moisture across much of the Australian interior and consequently biocrusts may experience a decline in biomass, structure, and function which could have significant repercussions beyond carbon stocks.					; Elliott, David/E-2816-2010	Thomas, Andrew/0000-0002-1360-1687; Elliott, David/0000-0001-9837-7890; Bullard, Joanna/0000-0002-2030-0188; Webster, Richard/0000-0002-3424-9301													0016-7061	1872-6259				JAN 1	2022	405								115464	10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115464	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115464		SEP 2021											WOS:000703712100043
J	Ma, CK; Luo, Y; Shao, MG				Ma, Changkun; Luo, Yi; Shao, Mingan			Comparative modeling of the effect of thinning on canopy interception loss in a semiarid black locust (<i>Robinia pseudoacacia</i>) plantation in Northwest China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Canopy interception loss is a key component of forest hydrological cycle that determine the amount of net rainfall reaching forest floor together with drought/climate stressors affecting dryland forest plantations. A good understanding of the relationship between canopy interception loss and forest management such as thinning is important for improved watershed management and ecological services. In this study, we measured event-based rainfall partitioning for a thinned (TH, with 38% basal area removed) and a control (CT) Robinia pseudoacacia forest plantation during leafed and leafless seasons in 2015 in the semiarid Loess Plateau region in China. Interception loss from both forest plots were simulated using the Revised Gash Analytical Model (RGAM) and the WiMo model. The results showed that observed annual throughfall, stemflow and interception loss were respectively 80.8%, 1.7% and 17.5% of the gross rainfall under CT. The corresponding values under TH were 87.9%, 0.8% and 11.3%, respectively. The RGAM and WiMo models were well calibrated and validated using filed data collected in leafed and leafless seasons. The analyses suggested that models accurately predicated interception loss under both CT and TH conditions and captured seasonal variations in canopy and meteorological parameters. The RGAM model was most sensitive to the ratio of mean evaporation rate to mean rainfall intensity, and canopy storage capacity in leafed season, and to the ratio of mean evaporation rate to mean rainfall intensity in leafless season. Moreover, 37.2% and 42.1% of the interception in leafed season evaporated from the canopy respectively during rainfall event and after rainfall. The corresponding values for leafless season were respectively 49.3% and 22.4%. Overall, the performance of the optimized RGAM and WiMo models were satisfactory with respect to modeling error ( - 6.9 - - 2.9%) and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (0.80-0.94), although that of the optimized RGAM model was slightly superior to WiMo model. The models would facilitate the implementation of water-oriented management in semiarid forest plantations through a more accurate simulation of the impact of thinning on interception loss.

Moderate leaf rolling keeps leaves upright and maintains the relatively normal photosynthesis of plants under drought stress. However, the molecular mechanism of wheat leaf rolling remains unclear. Here, we identified a candidate gene TaMYB5-3A that regulates leaf rolling by using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a panel of 323 wheat accessions. Phenotype analysis indicated that the leaves of tamyb5 mutants were flatter than that of the wild type under drought condition. A nucleotide variation in the TaMYB5-3A coding region resulted in a substitution of Thr to Lys, which corresponds to two alleles SNP-3A-1 and SNP-3A-2. The leaf rolling index (LRI) of the SNP-3A-1 genotype was significantly lower than that of the SNP-3A-2 genotype. In addition, TaMYB5-3A alleles were associated with canopy temperature (CT) in multiple environments. The CT of the SNP-3A-1 genotype was lower than that of the SNP-3A-2 genotype. Gene expression analysis showed that TaMYB5-3A was mainly expressed in leaves and down-regulated by PEG and ABA treatment. TaMYB5 induces TaNRL1 gene expression through the direct binding to the AC cis-acting element of the promoter of the target gene, which was validated by EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay). Our results revealed a crucial molecular mechanism in wheat leaf rolling and provided the theoretical basis and a gene resource for crop breeding.																			1664-462X					AUG 23	2022	13								897623	10.3389/fpls.2022.897623	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.897623								36082295					WOS:000862767400001

From 2012 to 2018, SM's effects on soil mois-ture and temperature and production performances were compared with other mulching practices, using three treatments: full-cover plastic mulch (PM), no mulch with wheat sown in rows as the control (CK), and SM with 50% to 59% of the field area mulched. Compared with CK, on average over six growing sea-sons, SM and PM increased grain yield by 27.0% and 21.7%, straw yield by 21.6% and 22.6%, kernels ha(-1) by 26.6% and 19.0%, net income by 29.8% and -25.0%, soil temperature at 5 cm by -1.5 degrees C and 0.2 degrees C from overwintering to maturity, and soil water storage at 0-200 cm by 25 and 22 mm, respectively. The increase in soil moisture in SM and PM was greater in the early period (overwintering to jointing) than in the later period (booting to maturity) and at 0 to 120 cm than at 120-200 cm in the early period. Although the mean evapotranspiration of whole growth period across six seasons was similar among treatments, SM and PM increased water consumption during the key formation period of yield compo-nents after overwintering by 16 and 32 mm, respectively, while reducing it before overwintering. Compared with CK, SM and PM had the effects of warming during overwintering and cooling after jointing. By increasing water consumption after overwintering and ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration and providing favorable soil temperature for multiple growth stages and more sufficient soil moisture, SM and PM promoted vegetative growth and increased kernels ha(-1), the main mechanisms by which SM and PM increased grain yield relative to CK. Relative to PM, SM is a more economically beneficial and environment-friendly technology for dryland wheat production. (C) 2021 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS.

We simulated the ET variation in a rain-fed spring maize field in the eastern Loess Plateau using the Pemnan-Monteith (PM), Shuttleworth-Wallace (SW), and modified Priestley-Taylor (PTm) models. Then we compared their results with the observed ET using the eddy covariance (EC) method. Generally, the diurnal variation in estimated ET from the three models was similar to that of observed ET by the EC method. However, the PM model significantly underestimated ET. The ET estimates obtained from the SW and PTm models were approximately equal to the observed ET by the EC method. Considering the PTm model's simplicity, we fmally recommend it for rain-fed spring maize fields in the Loess Plateau. After precipitation, the estimated ET from the three models was significantly smaller than measured ET by the EC method, especially the PM model. After a frost, all three models failed to reflect the dramatic decrease in crop transpiration, and thus significantly overestimated ET.																			0021-8588	1881-0136				OCT	2020	76	4					155	163		10.2480/agrmet.D-20-00010	http://dx.doi.org/10.2480/agrmet.D-20-00010													WOS:000580591300001

Fungal Communities on Standing Litter Are Structured by Moisture Type and Constrain Decomposition in a Hyper-Arid Grassland	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Non-rainfall moisture (fog, dew, and water vapor; NRM) is an important driver of plant litter decomposition in grasslands, where it can contribute significantly to terrestrial carbon cycling. However, we still do not know whether microbial decomposers respond differently to NRM and rain, nor whether this response affects litter decomposition rates. To determine how local moisture regimes influence decomposer communities and their function, we examined fungal communities on standing grass litter at an NRM-dominated site and a rain-dominated site 75 km apart in the hyper-arid Namib Desert using a reciprocal transplant design. Dominant taxa at both sites consisted of both extremophilic and cosmopolitan species. Fungal communities differed between the two moisture regimes with environment having a considerably stronger effect on community composition than did stage of decomposition. Community composition was influenced by the availability of air-derived spores at each site and by specialization of fungi to their home environment; specifically, fungi from the cooler, moister NRM Site performed worse (measured as fungal biomass and litter mass loss) when moved to the warmer, drier rain-dominated site while Rain Site fungi performed equally well in both environments. Our results contribute to growing literature demonstrating that as climate change alters the frequency, magnitude and type of moisture events in arid ecosystems, litter decomposition rates may be altered and constrained by the composition of existing decomposer communities.

In this regard, climate records from satellites are good alternatives. However, the accuracy of these datasets needs to be validated and their performance should be evaluated. Hence, this study aimed at evaluating the performance of four satellite-derived bioclimatic variables for modeling invasive Prosopis juliflora distribution in the dryland ecosystem of Ethiopia. Accordingly, WorldClim1.4 bioclimatic variables were used as a baseline to evaluate their performance, while, gauge-derived bioclimatic variables were used to validate all tested datasets. A total of 240 species occurrence and absence points were used to train and test the performance of all models using the Random Forest algorithm. Accordingly, satellite-derived bioclimatic variables provide better performance with an area under the curve of 0.64 and true skill statistics of 0.4 compared to a reanalysis and WorldClim1.4 derived bioclimatic variables. However, the lower performance of satellite datasets indicates the importance of its integration with other variables.

Phytolith analyses, together with radiocarbon dating of samples from 10 sites in Zhengzhou, showed that common millet and foxtail millet were cultivated with rice in the region around 4000-3000 cal BC. The ratio of crop remains revealed that common millet was dominant in the crop structure. Rice cultivation was no longer confined to large sites situated in the lowlands and began to spread into the hilly lands and small sites. Furthermore, both dryland and wetland systems may have been used for rice cultivation. This pattern of crop production may have been mainly influenced by social background and artificial selection, which overcame the limitation of environmental factors. Such development of Yangshao agriculture facilitated the establishment of an agricultural society during the fourth millennium BC. It also has implications for understanding the reason why the middle Yellow River region (Central Plain) became known as 'the cradle of Chinese civilization'.

A number of studies have demonstrated that nitrogen availability is a key regulator of the CH4 oxidation process. However, how plants mediate soil CH4 oxidation in response to N addition, particularly in saline-alkaline grasslands in the vast regions of the northern China, has received little attention. We conducted a 3-yr (2017-2019) in-situ experiment with eight N addition levels to examine the effect of N on soil CH4 oxidation, and to explore the linkages between the N-induced changes of plant community and the seasonal dynamics of CH4 in a saline-alkaline grassland. We found that the saline-alkaline grassland was a weak CH4 sink displaying nonlinear CH4 uptake levels in response to N additions, possibly due to the nonlinear changes in the abundance of key functional genes (pmoA) that were responsible for CH4 oxidation. The changes in plant productivity and diversity that were induced by N additions explained 21 % of the variations in CH4 uptake. The N-induced increase in productivity indirectly enhanced CH4 uptake at N addition rates of <10 g m(-2) yr(-1), while the decrease in biodiversity indirectly inhibited CH4 uptake when N addition exceeded 10 g m(-2) yr(-1). The N-induced changes in the plant community can affect CH4 uptake, mainly through the rhizospheric effects of plants. In conclusion, our findings underscore the importance of rhizosphere when assessing the CH4 uptake in saline-alkaline grassland ecosystems.

Rhizosphere samples were collected from the dominant and main companion species in farmlands abandoned for up to 32 years in the Loess Plateau. We determined soil chemical properties, phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles and activities of four enzymes (beta-1,4-glucosidase, BG; beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase, NAG; L-leucine aminopeptidase, LAP and alkaline phosphatase, AP), specific enzyme activity per soil organic carbon (SOC) and per PLFA unit. Specific BG, NAG, LAP and AP activities per SOC unit significantly decreased 77.1%, 53.2%, 83.0% and 49.2% with plant succession. Specific BG, NAG and LAP activities per PLFA unit significantly decreased 59.6%, 18.9% and 70.9% with plant succession. Furthermore, specific BG and LAP activities in the dominant species were lower than those in the companion species. Redundancy analysis revealed that variations in specific enzyme activities per SOC and per PLFA unit were explained 76.6% and 68.6% by soil chemical properties. SOC, total nitrogen (TN) and available phosphorus (aP) significantly influenced the rhizosphere-specific enzyme activities. This study improved the understanding of the element cycle at the root-soil interface under secondary succession ecosystems.

These 'adaptation services' can be sustained, latent, or novel, depend on persistence or transformation of ecosystems, and require varying co-production by people. Adaptation services also include climate mitigation. We present an approach to explore an extensive set of land use and climate scenarios that outline possible futures for a landscape, and quantify the contributions of adaptation services. We quantified adaptation success across six criteria relevant to the region, characterised the contributions of different types of adaptation services, and mapped spatial variation in contributions across the landscape. We built an integrated model of the Mackenzie District (an upland landscape of Aotearoa New Zealand), and analysed 1200 hypothetical scenarios for the period 2060-2070. We found many adaptation options, with 46% of scenarios meeting the criteria for successful adaptation. Four sustained, two latent and five novel services co-produced through financial input made diverse contributions to economic profit, profit resilience, climate change mitigation, climate risk adaptation, landscape cultural heritage and biodiversity. Successful adaptation scenarios were multifunctional, relying on alternative combinations of services allowed by spatial heterogeneity. By accounting for the numerous relationships between people and natural components within complex landscape systems, our advanced simulation approach can inform participatory pathway development by quantifying the potential for nature to contribute to future climate change adaptation.

Quantifying spatiotemporal patterns of urbanization is crucial for maintaining the sustainability on the TP. This study took Xining City, the largest city on the TP, as an example to understand the urban expansion in this region in the past 50 years. We combined the high-resolution spy satellite data and China's long-term urban land dataset (CULD) to quantify the urban expansion of Xining City. The object-oriented random forest classification was performed to extract urban land from spy satellite data in 1969, and the inter-annual correction was used to combine urban land information from 1969 to 2017. We found that the proposed approach can accurately quantify the urban expansion of Xining City over the past half century with an overall accuracy of 91% and a kappa coefficient of 0.86. Such high accuracy benefits from the fine resolution of spy satellite data and the consistency of CULD. We also found that Xining City experienced accelerated and fragmented urban sprawl to higher altitude areas, as a result of socioeconomic development and topographical limitations. The acceleration of urban expansion was more obvious, and the urban landscape fragmentation was more serious at high altitude areas. Such urban expansion encroached on cropland and grassland, and caused increased risks of landslides and other geological disasters. Therefore, Xining City urgently needs to promote the development of compact cities to control urban sprawl at higher altitude areas and provide a reference for improving urban sustainability across the TP. In this study, we analyzed the urban expansion of Xining city from 1969 to 2017, and provided a reliable way to understand the long-term spatiotemporal urbanization based on remote sensing, which has the potential for wide applications. In addition, the extracted urban information can help to improve the urban sustainability of Xining City and the entire TP.					刘, 海猛/AAP-3802-2020; Liu, Haimeng/R-7364-2018; Liu, Zhifeng/IWU-7476-2023; Liu, Haimeng/ACQ-9123-2022	Liu, Haimeng/0000-0003-0390-9140; Liu, Zhifeng/0000-0002-4087-0743; Liu, Haimeng/0000-0003-0390-9140; liu, zhifeng/0000-0001-5124-9824														2072-4292				JAN	2021	13	1							46	10.3390/rs13010046	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13010046													WOS:000606226700001

In these ecosystems, plant functional types are particularly important in realizing many ecosystem processes such as the dynamics and regulations of net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) to the changing environment. Here, we measured the diurnal dynamics of NEE in patches of succulent and non-succulent shrubs over two growing seasons (2012 and 2013) in the Alxa Desert, located in northern China. We find that the interannual difference of NEE was greater for the non succulent shrub than that for he succulent shrub species. Diurnal NEE changes were similar for all species and were more strongly influenced by soil moisture than by temperature. Nonetheless, these environmental factors had a greater influence on non-succulent shrubs than succulent shrubs. Our findings highlight that species with different life history traits have different NEE dynamics and vary by time scales. These dynamics are strongly tied to water availability and plant type-specific water storage capacity, with plants possessing large water storage organs maintaining their physiological functioning better under stressful conditions. Our findings on the interaction between plant type and environment could be used to improve estimates of terrestrial carbon uptake in critical desert ecosystems.

In the north-east Pacific Ocean, where there are many environmentally sensitive benthic organisms whose morphology and function are equally important, SfM surveys are less commonly studied. Temperate waters pose unique challenges to SfM workflows, which must be systematically unpacked to understand their impact on data quality and veracity. This uncertainty raises broader questions concerning SfM as a spatial data-acquisition and ecological characterisation method in temperate waters, and whether a systematic workflow assessment reveals vital relationships between SfM implementation parameters, 3D data products and their implications for underwater SfM surveys. This paper, the second of two empirical assessments, reports on a series of wet-lab and dryland tests quantifying the impact that temperate waters, underwater cameras, and photograph quantity and configuration have on SfM accuracy. These tests provided crucial accuracy benchmarks informing subsequent field-based surveys and revealed that underwater SfM workflows can generate highly accurate 3D models in temperate waters.																			0031-868X	1477-9730				MAR	2022	37	177					35	60		10.1111/phor.12399	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/phor.12399		MAR 2022											WOS:000765260800001

Seasonal variations of transpiration efficiency coefficient of irrigated wheat	HELIYON												Global diminishing water resources, especially due to climate change have serious impacts on evaporation (E) from the soil surface, transpiration (T) from plants (crops) and grain yield, which relates to water use efficiency of different crops. A study was conducted at Kenilworth over two wheat cropping seasons (2007 and 2008) with the objectives of: (i) evaluating the effect of soils and seasons on T, E and yield, and (ii) relating these parameters to transpiration efficiency coefficient. The treatments included two soil types and two soil surface treatments (bare and mulched), which were all replicated four times. Weekly irrigation was done using a surface drip system while maintaining the water table at a constant depth. Soil water content was monitored using a neutron probe. Neither soils nor seasons were found to significantly influence the partitioning of evapotranspiration (ET), and T varied from 74 to 76% of ET while E varied between 24 and 26%. Surface treatments caused significant differences in grain yield in both seasons. Reducing evaporative loss improves the water productivity of wheat, which has an important implication in dryland farming.

Here, we analyzed the tolerance of wheat strains XM26 and LM23 to low-nitrogen stress using a chlorate sensitivity experiment. Subsequently, we performed transcriptome analyses of both varieties exposed to low-nitrogen (LN) and normal (CK) treatments. Compared with those under CK treatment, 3534 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in XM26 in roots and shoots under LN treatment (p < 0.05, and |log2FC| > 1). A total of 3584 DEGs were detected in LM23. A total of 3306 DEGs, including 863 DEGs in roots and 2443 DEGs in shoots, were specifically expressed in XM26 or showed huge differences between XM26 and LM23 (log2FC ratio > 3). These were selected for gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses. The calcium-mediated plant-pathogen interaction, MAPK signaling, and phosphatidylinositol signaling pathways were enriched in XM26 but not in LM23. We also verified the expression of important genes involved in these pathways in the two varieties using qRT-PCR. A total of 156 transcription factors were identified among the DEGs, and their expression patterns were different between the two varieties. Our findings suggest that calcium-related pathways play different roles in the two varieties, eliciting different tolerances to low-nitrogen stress.					wang, wenjuan/JGD-0428-2023; Zhang, Lijun/JEZ-7925-2023; Xu, Cheng/GXH-4815-2022; zheng, xin/JNS-5523-2023; Li, Shuyao/JRY-8603-2023; jin, li/IWU-4648-2023; Luo, Mingzhao/JFA-6689-2023; Li, Fan/JRY-4017-2023; huang, libo/JMB-4345-2023; wang, wenxin/JOZ-3291-2023	Xu, Cheng/0000-0003-1000-733X; Xu, Zhao-Shi/0000-0001-8028-6413														1422-0067				NOV	2021	22	22							12278	10.3390/ijms222212278	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms222212278								34830160					WOS:000726912400001

The study was undertaken to identify and estimate effects of loci underlying quantitative resistance to SB at the seedling and adult plant stages. A panel of 261 high input (HI-AM) barley genotypes consisting of released cultivars, advanced breeding lines, and landraces, was screened for resistance to SB. The seedling resistance screening was conducted using two virulent isolates from Morocco (ICSB3 and SB54) while the adult plant stage resistance was evaluated at two hot spot locations, Faizabad and Varanasi, in India under artificial inoculation using a mixture of prevalent virulent isolates. The HI-AM panel was genotyped using DArT-Seq high-throughput genotyping platform. Genome wide association mapping (GWAM) was conducted using 13,182 PAV and 6,311 SNP markers, for seedling and adult plant resistance. Both GLM and MLM model were employed in TASSEL (v 5.0) using principal component analysis and Kinship Matrix as covariates. Final disease rating and Area Under Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC) were used for the evaluation of adult stage plant resistance. The GWAM analysis indicated 23 QTL at the seedling stage (14 for isolate ICSB3 and 9 for isolate SB54), while 15 QTL were detected at the adult plant stage resistance (6 at Faizabad and 9 at Varanasi) and 5 for AUDPC based resistance at Varanasi. Common QTL at seedling and adult plant stages were found across all barley chromosomes. Seedling stage QTL explained together 73.24% of the variance for seedling resistance to isolate ICSB3 and 49.26% for isolate SB54, whereas, QTL for adult plant stage resistance explained together 38.32%, 44.09% and 26.42% of the variance at Faizabad and Varanasi and AUDPC at Varanasi, respectively. Several QTL identified in this study were also reported in previous studies using bi-parental and association mapping populations, corroborating our results. The promising QTL detected at both stages, once validated, can be used for marker assisted selection (MAS) in SB resistance barley breeding program.

Fellowship of the Spring: An initiative to document and protect the world's oases	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												An 'oasis' signifies a refugium of safety, recovery, relaxation, fertility, and productivity in an inhospitable desert, a sweet spot in a barren landscape where life-giving water spills forth from the Earth. Remarkable mythological congru-encies exist across dryland cultures worldwide where oases or 'arid-land springs' occur. In many places they also pro-vide specialised habitats for an extraordinary array of endemic organisms. To inform their management, and maintain their integrity, it is essential to understand the hydrogeology of aquifers and springs. Gravity-fed vs artesian aquifers; actively recharged vs fossil aquifers, and sources of geothermal activity are important concepts presented here. There consequences for oases of sustainable and unsustainable groundwater extraction, and other examples of effective con-servation management. Oases are archetypes for human consciousness, habitats that deserve protection and conserva-tion, and a lingua franca for multicultural values and scientific exchange. We represent an international Fellowship of the Spring seeking to encompass and facilitate the stewardship of oases and aquifers through improved knowledge, outreach, and governance.

Here, we combined multiple satellite-derived vegetation indices with eddy covariance datasets to evaluate the spatiotemporal changes in spring phenological changes over the Pan-Third Pole. We found that the spring phenology over Pan-Third Pole continues to advance at the rate of 4.8 days decade(-1) during the warming hiatus period, which is contrasted to a non-significant change over the northern hemisphere. Such a significant and continued advance in spring phenology was mainly attributed to an increase in preseason minimum temperature and water availability. Moreover, there is an overall increasing importance of precipitation on changes in spring phenology during the last four decades. We further demonstrated that this increasingly negative correlation was also found across more than two-thirds of the dryland region, tentatively suggesting that spring phenological changes might shift from temperature to precipitation-controlled over the Pan-Third Pole in a warmer world.

LATE HOLOCENE ANTHROPIC DEGRADATION RECORDS IN SEMI-ARID ENVIRONMENTS (NE SPAIN AND NW ARGENTINA)	CUADERNOS DE INVESTIGACION GEOGRAFICA												Information about Holocene sedimentary records in two semiarid areas in Spain and Argentina was gathered to know the role of the anthropic influence on landscape evolution. In both cases, four aggradational units separated by incision phases have been differentiated. Due to the confluence of anthropic indicators, the H1C subunit (ca. 2.45-ca. 1.5 ka cal BP) in the central sector of the Ebro basin (NE Spain), and the H2B subunit (2.45-ca. 0.6 ka cal BP) in the Tafi valley (NW Argentina) are worthy of attention. In both cases, a soil formed around 2.45 cal BP was degraded, because it was the object of intense overexploitation in the Ibero-Roman period in the Ebro valley and Formative period in Tafi valley. The final results of these processes represented transformations so significant that the landscape was unable to recover posteriorly. In highly vulnerable dryland environments, the establishment of adequate criteria to link strong landscape degradative phases with human activity is of high interest to know de older phases of the Anthropocene or Paleoanthropocene.						/0000-0003-4067-8222													0211-6820	1697-9540					2019	45	1					195	217		10.18172/cig.3587	http://dx.doi.org/10.18172/cig.3587													WOS:000471948300009

Episodic occurrence of favourable weather constrains recovery of a cold desert shrubland after fire	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Key to the long-term resilience of dryland ecosystems is the recovery of foundation plant species following disturbance. In ecosystems with high interannual weather variability, understanding the influence of short-term environmental conditions on establishment of foundation species is essential for identifying vulnerable landscapes and developing restoration strategies. We asked how annual environmental conditions affect post-fire establishment of Artemisia tridentata, a shrub species that dominates landscapes across much of the western United States, and evaluated the influence of episodic establishment on population recovery. 2. We collected A. tridentata stem samples from 33 plots in 12 prescribed fire sites that burned 8-11 years before sampling. We determined individual establishment years using annual growth rings. We measured seasonal soil environmental conditions at the study sites and asked if these conditions predicted annual establishment density. We then evaluated whether establishment patterns could be predicted by site-level climate or dominant subspecies. Finally, we tested the effect of the magnitude and frequency of post-fire establishment episodes on long-term population recovery. 3. Annual post-fire recruitment of A. tridentata was driven by the episodic availability of spring soil moisture. Annual establishment was highest with wetter spring soils (relative influence [RI] = 19.4%) and later seasonal dry-down (RI = 11.8%) in the year of establishment. Establishment density declined greatly 4 to 5 years after fire (RI = 17.1%). Post-fire establishment patterns were poorly predicted by site-level mean climate (marginal R-2 <= 0.18) and dominant subspecies (marginal R-2 <= 0.43). 4. Population recovery reflected the magnitude, but not the frequency, of early post-fire establishment pulses. Post-fire A. tridentata density and cover (measured 8-11 years after fire) were more strongly related to the magnitude of the largest establishment pulse than to establishment frequency, suggesting that population recovery may occur with a single favourable establishment year. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates the importance of episodic periods of favourable weather for long-term plant population recovery following disturbance. Management strategies that increase opportunities for seed availability to coincide with favourable weather conditions, such as retaining unburned patches or repeated seeding treatments, can improve restoration outcomes in high-priority areas.

Seedlings of the native trees Anadenanthera colubrina and Astronium urundeuva were planted in nine paired blocks with intact and removed herbaceous vegetation. In addition, seeds of the invasive tree species Leucaena leucocephala were sown in the same paired plots. Growth, germination, establishment, and survival of the tree species were monitored for 8 months. The results showed that herbaceous vegetation hampered native seedling growth in respect to leaf number, leaf size, height, and stem diameter. Conversely, herbaceous vegetation had a neutral effect on the germination, establishment, and growth of the invasive species L. leucocephala. Dominant ruderal herbaceous species strongly prevent the natural succession of native trees in this semiarid forest, while not affecting the establishment of an invasive tree. Management of herbaceous vegetation cover in degraded areas might be a key step for successful restoration in this dryland.

Moench, one of the most important dryland cereal crops, is moderately tolerant of soil salinity, a rapidly increasing agricultural problem due to inappropriate irrigation management and salt water intrusion into crop lands as a result of climate change. The mechanisms for sorghum's tolerance of high soil salinity have not been elucidated. This study tested whether sorghum plants adapt to salinity stress via stomatal regulation or osmotic adjustment. Sorghum plants were treated with one of seven concentrations of NaCl (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, or 100 mM). Leaf gas exchange (net CO2 assimilation (A), transpiration (Tr); stomatal conductance of water vapor (gs), intrinsic water use efficiency (WUE)), and water (Psi w), osmotic (Psi o), and turgor Psi t potentials were evaluated at 40 days after the imposition of salinity treatments. Plants exhibited decreased A, gs, and Tr with increasing salinity, whereas WUE was not affected by NaCl treatment. Additionally, plants exhibited osmotic adjustment to increasing salinity. Thus, sorghum appears to adapt to high soil salinity via both osmotic adjustment and stomatal regulation.

Helpers don't help when it's hot in a cooperatively breeding bird, the Southern Pied Babbler	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY												Cooperative breeding, where more than two individuals invest in rearing a single brood, occurs in many bird species globally and often contributes to improved breeding outcomes. However, high temperatures are associated with poor breeding outcomes in many species, including cooperative species. We used data collected over three austral summer breeding seasons to investigate the contribution that helpers make to daytime incubation in a cooperatively breeding species, the Southern Pied Babbler Turdoides bicolor, and the ways in which their contribution is influenced by temperature. Helpers spent a significantly higher percentage of their time foraging (41.8 +/- 13.7%) and a significantly lower percentage of their time incubating (18.5 +/- 18.8%) than members of the breeding pair (31.3 +/- 11% foraging and 37.4 +/- 15.7% incubating). In groups with only one helper, the helper's contribution to incubation was similar to that of breeders. However, helpers in larger groups contributed less to incubation, individually, with some individuals investing no time in incubation on a given observation day. Helpers significantly decrease their investment in incubation on hot days (>35.5 degrees C), while breeders tend to maintain incubation effort as temperatures increase. Our results demonstrate that pied babblers share the workload of incubation unequally between breeders and helpers, and this inequity is more pronounced during hot weather. These results may help to explain why recent studies have found that larger group size does not buffer against the impacts of high temperatures in this and other cooperatively breeding species.

Production System Diversification and Livelihood in the Drylands of North Central Mexico	SUSTAINABILITY												Drylands (arid and semi-arid regions) are important regions in the world; they have been disregarded and considered poor undeveloped regions due to their ecological limitations. Farmers in these regions tend towards diversification of production systems in order to achieve livelihood security, and this phenomenon has not been extensively studied. The objective of this study was to create a typology of the production systems present in the Mexican north central drylands, using variables related to production, socioeconomics, and social capital. 1044 interviews were conducted in the semi-arid region of north central Mexico. Analysis of the data allowed for the observation of nine types of production systems distributed in three groups: Subsistence, commercial, and off-farm income systems. The differences observed within these systems are due to generational gaps, gender differences, market orientation, and social capital. It can be concluded that the diversification of the dryland production systems allows for an understanding of why generic public policies have failed to mitigate poverty in these regions. The implications of the study refer to the reconfiguration of Mexican policies for the development of the drylands.

In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of naturally occurring and commercial entomopathogenic nematode species against the sugar beet wireworm, Limonius californicus (Mannerheim), in the laboratory. First, efficacies of Steinernema feltiae (Filipjev) (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae) collected from an irrigated (S. feltiae-SSK) and a dryland (S. feltiae-SSC) field and the two commercial entomopathogenic nematode species, S. carpocapsae (Weiser) (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae) and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar (Rhabditida: Heterorhabditidae), were examined. Efficacies of the two field-collected S. feltiae isolates were also compared against a commercial S. feltiae strain. In the first bioassay, S. feltiae-SSK caused 63.3% wireworm mortality, followed by 30% caused by S. carpocapsae, 23.3% by S. feltiae-SSC, and 6.7% by H.bacteriophora. In the second assay, S. feltiae-SSK killed 56.7% of the wireworms, approximate to 2.1- and approximate to 5.7-fold higher than S. feltiae-SSC and the commercial isolate, respectively.

Recombinant strains ZHW15 and ZHW25 produced both antibiotics and maintained population sizes in the rhizosphere of wheat that were comparable to those of strain 2-79. The recombinant strains inhibited in vitro the wheat pathogens Rhizoctonia solani anastomosis group 8 (AG-8) and AG-2-1, Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Fusarium culmorum, and F. pseudograminearum significantly more than did strain 2-79. Both the wild-type and recombinant strains were equally inhibitory of Pythium ultimum.

To explore the variation law of the mean velocity of overland flow under the influence of gramineous plants typical in the Loess Plateau in North-Western China, indoor scouring tests with ten levels of vegetation coverage (9.42 %-94.25 %), seven unit discharges (0.278-1.667 L center dot m(-1)center dot s(-1)), and five slope gradients (4 degrees-12 degrees) were performed. The results showed that the mean flow velocity initially increased and then decreased with an increase in vegetation coverage, and the critical cover was affected by the unit discharge. For a slope of 4 degrees, the mean flow velocity with a vegetation coverage of 94.25 % was only 21.6 %-32.0 % of that on a bare slope, indicating that vegetation can effectively reduce flow velocity. For each experiment conducted, with an increase in vegetation coverage, the overland flow gradually moved from laminar flow to transitional flow. Based on the principle of equivalent roughness and Manning's equation, a prediction model was also established in order to predict more accurately the mean velocity associated with overland flow, and it has been validated against the experimental results demonstrating a satisfactory agreement with the measured values (adj.R2 = 0.879, NSE = 0.867). These results provide further insights regarding the influence that the vegetation can have on the flow velocity and contribute to develop a better management of these environmental areas.

Their small size, short hydroperiod, or severe disturbance make these ponds undetectable by most remote sensing systems. Here we show, for the first time, that the distributed hydrologic model IBER+ detects ephemeral and even extinct wetlands by fully exploiting the available digital elevation model and resolving many microtopographic features at drainage basin scales of about 1000 km2. This paper aims to implement a methodology for siting flood-prone areas that can potentially host a temporary wetland, validating the results with historical orthophotos and existing wetlands inventories. Our model succeeds in dryland endorheic catchments of the Upper Guadalquivir Basin: it has detected 89% of the previously catalogued wetlands and found four new unknown wetlands. In addition, we have found that 24% of the detected wetlands have disappeared because of global change. Subsequently, environmental managers could use the proposed methodology to locate wetlands quickly and cheaply. Finding wetlands would help monitor their conservation and restore them if needed.

Human occupation, site formation, and chronostratigraphy of a mid-Holocene archaeological site at the eastern Pampa-Patagonia transition, Argentina	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Intense aeolian processes in arid and semi-arid environments play an essential role in the preservation and destruction of archeological sites. This is especially the case in the lower basin of the Colorado River at the eastern Pampa-Patagonia Transition of Argentina, as is illustrated by geoarchaeological and chronostratigraphic studies at a mid-Holocene hunter-gatherer site, La Modesta, where aeolian processes strongly influence the archeological record in dune sediments. At La Modesta, surface archaeological materials are numerous and well preserved, although the stratigraphic record is incomplete. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of sediments that contain cultural material provides a chronology dating from ca. 8.2 ka but shows one or more hiatuses from ca. 6-2 ka in the sedimentary succession. Intense morphogenesis related to arid climates likely caused gaps in sedimentation, affecting the integrity and resolution of the archaeological record. This study helps explain mid-Holocene archaeological discontinuities throughout central Argentina and highlights the importance of considering taphonomic and geologic biases when dealing with the absence or reduction of the archaeological record in dryland regions.

To do this, first, interviews were conducted with restaurant owners and managers in the O'Higgins Region, Chile, to identify the requirements they pose to their suppliers. Likewise, surveys and in-depth interviews were conducted with female farmers in the Madre Tierra Germinando group (Mother Earth Germinating, in English), located in the Coastal Dryland of the O'Higgins Region. This, is to characterize their current productive and commercial situation, as well as their opinions. Through a chart, the information regarding the requirements of the restaurants and the characteristics and opinions of the female farmers were compared. The diversity and natural origin are an advantage of the female farmers; however, guaranteeing volume in a stable way, as well as transport, are the two requirements whose fulfillment is more complex. However, there is a positive attitude toward collaborative solutions; stable relationships based on mutual knowledge and trust between farmers and restaurants are essential.

J	Yizhaq, H; Stavi, I				Yizhaq, Hezi; Stavi, Ilan			Ring formation in<i> Stipagrostis</i><i> obtusa</i> in the arid north-eastern Negev, Israel	FLORA												In drylands, particularly in sandy environments, clonal plants occasionally develop into ring patterns that slowly expand radially, leaving bare soil in the ring's center. Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain ring formation, and yet it is very difficult to find out the dominant driving mechanism for each specific ecosystem. This study is the first to assess the rings of Stipagrostis obtusa in the north-eastern Negev of Israel, an arid region with mean annual precipitation of & AP;65 mm. Our results propose that S. obtusa rings form in response to the infiltration feedback, which is enhanced by microtopography; the rings developed on small mounds due to continuous deposition of sand and dust. The infiltration feedback is caused by the sharp contrast in water infiltrability between the rings and the inter-ring spaces, where infiltration is lower. In addition, during heavy rainstorms, runoff generated in the inter-ring spaces partially percolates in the rings' periphery and enhances radial expansion. These source-sink relations increase water availability for the S. obtusa plants, increasing their resilience to the harsh dryland conditions.

Using monthly temperature and the precipitation data during 2001-2013 period, a weather-based index was developed for the main crops of the district (sorghum, soybean, and pigeon pea; cotton was excluded) to assess the agrarian crisis due to low crops yields, in a more objective and less disputable way that could be preferred by a crop insurance company. While the mean value of WI was 1.0, its range was 0.64 to 1.32 for pigeon pea, from 0.94 to 1.12 for sorghum, and from 0.31 to 1.72 for soybean. These ranges could be further divided appropriately into qualitative categories of to define agrarian crisis for the purpose of designing crop insurance plans to support farmers at their hard times thus making agricultural profession more sustainable.																			2285-6064						2019	8						109	113																WOS:000484814100015

The objective of this study was to assess the effects of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) applications triggered by canopy temperature and forecasted ambient temperatures on field-grown cotton plants. Yield and crop morphological responses to 1-MCP applications were investigated in field studies conducted during the summers of 2012 to 2014 at the Texas A&M University Field Laboratory in Burleson County, TX. Positive effects of 1-MCP were found for fruit retention in 2013 and 2014 for both irrigated and dryland studies; however, a negative impact was found in the 2012 irrigated study. By harvest, 1-MCP applications had no effect on final cotton yield or fiber quality parameters. Applications of 1-MCP affected some morphological characteristics of cotton plants; however, it did not improve crop yield.																			1523-6919	1524-3303					2019	23	1					118	130																WOS:000504897100013

However, little has been reported on the synergistic effects of multiple factors on crop production. Here, we reported the effects of five factors (i.e., variety, planting density, nitrogen application, supplemental irrigation, and plastic mulching) on crop yields, using data from a 5-yr experiment at Dongyang, Shanxi province of China. An incomplete factorial design with these factors comprised 12 treatments, including two controls: optimized technology (OT) and conventional technology (CT), comprising all five factors applied at the added or subtracted level, respectively. The result showed that, on 5-yr average, OT significantly increased maize yield by 3.5 Mg ha(-1) (44.3% more) as compared to CT (7.9 Mg ha(-1)), showing a huge potential for increasing yields. Among the five factors, plastic mulching contributed the most in yield increase (11.5%), and high density, improved variety, and irrigation contributed 9.9, 6.9, and 5.1% increases in yield, respectively. There were no significant differences in yield between two N input levels (i.e., 225 and 300 kg N ha(-1)), suggesting the N input of 225 kg N ha(-1) was sufficient to realize a yield level of 8-11 Mg ha(-1) in the studied area. In conclusion, reducing the yield gap can only be achieved by optimizing multiple factors simultaneously because the effects of single measure are relatively small and inconsistent among years. The results of our study will help develop adaptive management practices for increasing crop yield stability in other semi-arid regions.

The experiment was conducted in shrub-grass plots with nine levels of mixed vegetation coverage from 0% to 70%, three slopes (10 degrees,15 degrees, and 20 degrees) and two rainfall intensities (1.0 and 2.5 mm/min). The results showed that the vegetation coverage and slope gradient significantly affect runoff and sediment yield. Shrub-grass vegetation coverage had a significant effect on the runoff start-time, runoff flow velocity, runoff rate, and soil erosion rate on hillslopes. Mixed vegetation coverage could effectively delay the runoff starttime and decrease the runoff flow velocity. However, the effects of the slope gradient on runoff and sediment yield are opposite to those of vegetation coverage. Shrub-grass vegetation coverage could effectively increase runoff and sediment yield reduction benefits, while their benefits were affected by the rainfall intensity. At the 1.0 mm/min rainfall intensity, the reduction in the sediment production rate was greater than that under the 2.5 mm/min intensity. However, when the shrub-grass vegetation coverage exceeded 42%, the runoff reduction benefit was more obvious at higher rainfall intensities. The cumulative sediment yield increased with increasing cumulative runoff, and the rate of increase in the cumulative runoff was greater than that of the cumulative sediment yield with increasing of shrub-grass vegetation coverage. Moreover, there was a power function relationship between cumulative sediment yield and cumulative runoff yield (P < 0.05). Our paper is expected to provide a good reference on the ecological environment and vegetation construction on the Loess Plateau.

Diverse forms of xylem-Like cells and strand formation in Xylogenic <i>Eucalyptus bosistoana</i> callus culture	PLANT CELL TISSUE AND ORGAN CULTURE												In vitro xylem induction system is a basic tool in physiological, biochemical, and molecular studies of secondary cell wall formation, lignin biosynthesis and deposition associated with tracheary element formation. Eucalyptus bosistoana is a Class 1 durable hardwood tree species, selected by the New Zealand Dryland Forest Initiative for good quality wood and high adaptability to the NZ growing conditions. Xylogenic E. bosistoana callus culture was established and up to 40% of the callus cells were xylem-like cells (XLCs) which may have differentiated from small, cytoplasmically dense or compact dividing, and exhibited increased lignin contents during culture.

However, this practice ignores the impact of landform heterogeneity on the spatial distribution of grazing pressure, leading to localized patches of degraded grassland The spatial distribution of actual grazing density thus needs to be examined. Owing to the corresponding changes in resource availability and energy consumption as livestock move across an elevation gradient, we predict that livestock will preferentially use low-land and that different temporal patterns of grazing pressure will occur in the contrasting land forms. GPS location data and a machine learning technique were used to identify the seasonal pattern and the factors driving grazing pressure on a fenced ranch. Over both low-land and sand-dune landforms, the proportion of time that livestock spent on foraging increased from 63% in July to 67% in August and 69% in September, and non-foraging behavior decreased correspondingly. In low-land, the log-transformed average foraging density significantly increased from 0.61 (i.e., total foraging behaviors in 5 days measured at 50-s intervals per 10 x 10 m grid) in July to 0.66 in August and 0.88 in September, whereas there was no significant change on sand-dunes. From July to September, the relative area of low-land foraged by cattle accounted for 31%, 350, and 36%, respectively, and in sand-dunes the proportions increased from 45% to 47% to 51%. In low-land, the foraging density was negatively correlated with biomass (P = .07), total digestible nutrients (P < .05), and crude protein (P = .06) and positively correlated with acid detergent fiber (P < .05), whereas no such relationships were observed in sand-dunes. Our results indicate that topographic features should be considered when managing livestock, especially during periods with adverse conditions of herbage quality and quantity.

The precise distribution of this species is largely unknown to date, with few locality records spread biogeographically across Eastern Pakistan, Central and Western India. To improve on the existing spatial knowledge on this species and assess the ability to predict species distributions for taxa with few locality records, we studied the distribution of C. minor using a species distribution modelling framework. Our study allowed us to predict the distribution range of C. minor and help define a niche for this habitat-specific species. Highly probable habitats for C. minor were arid and semi-arid dryland habitats, characterised by plains or less rugged terrain with moderately narrow temperature range, lower aridity index, moderate to low vegetation index, and wide precipitation range. Furthermore, we report four additional occurrence records of C. minor from central Rajasthan.

The current paper aims to use check dams to deduce the amount of soil erosion under extreme rainstorms in a watershed and to identify the difference in sediment interception efficiency of different types of check dams. Based on the sediment deposition at 12 check dams with 100% sediment interception efficiency and sub-catchment clustering by taking 12 dam-controlled catchments as clustering criteria, the amount of soil erosion resulting from an extreme rainstorm event on July 26, 2017 (named "7.26" extreme rainstorm) was estimated in the Chabagou watershed in the hill and gully region of the Loess Plateau. The differences in the sediment interception efficiency among the check dams in the watershed were analyzed according to field observations at 17 check dams. The results show that the average erosion intensity under the "7-26" extreme rainstorm was approximately 2.03 x 10(4) t/km(2), which was 5 times that in the second largest erosive rainfall in 2017 (4.15 x 10(3) t/km(2)) and 11-384 times that for storms in 2018 (0.53 x 10(2) t/km(2) - 1.81 x 10(3) t/km(2)). Under the "7-26" extreme rainstorm, the amount of soil erosion in the Chabagou watershed above the Caoping hydrological station was 4.20 x 10(6) t. The sediment interception efficiency of the check dams with drainage canals (including the destroyed check dams) and with drainage culverts was 6.48 and 39.49%, respectively. The total actual sediment amount trapped by the check dams was 1.11 x 10(6) t, accounting for 26.36% of the total amount of soil erosion. In contrast, 3.09 x 10(6) t of sediment were input to the downstream channel, and the sediment deposition in the channel was 2.23 x 10(6) t, accounting for 53.15% of the total amount of soil erosion. The amount of sediment transport at the hydrological station was 8.60 x 10(5) t. The Sediment Delivery Ratio (SDR) under the "7.26" extreme rainstorm was 0.21. The results indicated that the amount of soil erosion was huge, and the sediment interception efficiency of the check dams was greatly reduced under extreme rainstorms. It is necessary to strengthen the management and construction technology standards of check dams to improve the sediment interception efficiency and flood safety in the watershed.

Activities such as livestock grazing can disturb ecosystem functions of biocrusts. However, it is unclear whether disturbance intensity impacts carbon emission from these biocrusts. Few studies have investigated the transformation of carbon within biocrusts after disturbance. Here, we conducted a field experiment on the Loess Plateau, China, in which we artificially simulated different intensities of trampling to examine the response of biocrust carbon emissions to disturbance. Our results demonstrate that disturbance significantly reduced biocrust coverage. The largest decreases were observed in the second through fourth intensity, which declined significantly by 12.6-17.1%. Disturbance decreased soil organic carbon content in the biocrust layer by 2.6 g kg(-1) -3.7 g kg(-1 )depending on the disturbance intensity. Disturbance significantly increased the soil easily oxidizable carbon (SEOC) content in the biocrust layer. The soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) content of the fifth intensity increased significantly by 70.3%. The soil mineralizable carbon (SMC) content of the fourth intensity increased significantly by 78.8%. Soil carbon emissions increased significantly with increasing disturbance intensity, were higher at night than during the day, and were higher in the summer than in the fall. Together, these findings indicate that the increase of carbon emission was mainly due to increases in SEOC and SMC. Trampling disturbance increases carbon emissions from biocrust soils. These losses of CO2 from biocrust soils after disturbance may substantially reduce the biocrust contribution to the soil carbon budget. (C) 2020 The Society for Range Management.

Increasing livestock density (LSKD) affects ecosystem structure and function, amplifies the effects of climate change, and facilitates disease transmission. Significant knowledge and data gaps regarding their density, spatial distribution, and changes over time exist but have not been explored beyond the county level. This is especially true regarding the unavailability of high-resolution gridded livestock data. Hence, we developed a gridded LSKD database of horses and small ruminants (i.e., sheep & goats) at high-resolution (1 km) for Kazakhstan (KZ) from 2000-2019 using vegetation proxies, climatic, socioeconomic, topographic, and proximity forcing variables through a random forest (RF) regression modeling. We found high-density livestock hotspots in the south-central and southeastern regions, whereas medium-density clusters in the northern and northwestern regions of KZ. Interestingly, population density, proximity to settlements, nighttime lights, and temperature contributed to the efficient downscaling of district-level censuses to gridded estimates. This database will benefit stakeholders, the research community, land managers, and policymakers at regional and national levels.

Understanding the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks under land use change and management is essential for achieving soil C sequestration through land-based solutions for drylands. In this paper, we briefly reviewed the literature to evaluate the impact of land use change and management on dryland SOC stocks. While the site-level field measurements of SOC stocks under different types of land use change and land management are remarkable, we found that the impact is hardly quantified at the regional level using selected soil datasets or process models and may be due to insufficient data quality, representativeness and information availability, which are among the major challenges of upscaling from field measurements to estimating regional SOC stocks. Therefore, we proposed a comprehensive framework following the IPCC inventory approach to improve future studies, which underlines the needs of data collection from multiple sources, meta-analysis for calculating SOC stock change factors, and matching land and soil datasets.

Successfully restoring native vegetation to degraded drylands is a global priority and major challenge-highlighting the need for more efficient and successful restoration strategies. We introduce the concept of "precision restoration," which targets critical biotic and abiotic barriers to restoration success and applies specific tools or methods based on barrier distribution in space and time. With an example from the sagebrush steppe biome, a North American cold desert, we present a framework for precision restoration in drylands that involves: (1) identifying site-specific critical barriers to restoration success, (2) understanding the spatial and temporal variability of each barrier, and (3) applying the best available restoration strategies given the specific barrier and its variability, described in the first two steps. This framework aims to enhance restoration success by focusing restoration practices on ameliorating the influential barriers when and where they occur and away from applying singular landscape-wide approaches.

Introducing cover crops as a fallow replacement in the Northern Great Plains: I. Evaluation of cover crop mixes as a forage source for grazing cattle	RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS												Crop-livestock integration has demonstrated that cover crops can be terminated using livestock grazing with minimal negative impacts on soil health, however, provides little information on system-level approaches that mutually benefit soil health and both crop and livestock production. Therefore, the objective of this research was to examine the effects of cover crop mixtures on biomass production, quality and the potential for nitrate toxicity on a dryland wheat-cover crop rotation. This research was conducted at the Montana State UniversityNorthern Agricultural Research Center near Havre, MT (48 degrees 29'N, -109 degrees 48'W) from 2012 to 2019. This experiment was conducted as a randomized-complete-block design, where 29 individual species were utilized in 15 different cover crop mixtures in a wheat-cover crop rotation. Cover crop mixtures were classified into four treatment groups, including (1) cool-season species, (2) warm-season species dominant, (3) cool and warm-season species mixture (mid-season), and (4) a barley (Hordeum vulgare) control. All cover crop mixtures were terminated at anthesis of cool-season cereal species to avoid volunteer cereal grains in the following wheat crop. At the time of cover crop termination, dry matter forage production was estimated and analyzed for crude protein, total digestible nutrients and nitrates as indicators of forage quality. All mixtures containing oats (Avena sativa) had greater (P. 0.03) biomass production than other mixtures within their respective treatment groups (cool- and mid-season). Forage biomass was influenced by cover crop treatment group, with the barley producing the greatest (P < 0.01) amount of forage biomass when compared to cool-, mid- and warm-season cover crop treatments. Total digestible nutrients were greater (P < 0.01) in the barley control compared to the cool- and mid-season treatment groups. Crude protein was greatest in the warm-season treatment group (P < 0.01) compared to the barley control, cool- and mid-season treatment groups. The barley control produced fewer nitrates (P. 0.05) than the cool-, mid- and warm-season treatment groups; however, all cover crop mixtures produced nitrates at levels unsafe for livestock consumption at least one year of the study. The relatively high and variable nitrate levels of all cover crop mixtures across years in this study suggest that forage should be tested for nitrates before grazing. In conclusion, our research suggests that in a dryland wheat-cover crop rotation that requires early-July termination, cool-season cover crop mixtures are the most suitable forage source for livestock grazing most years.

However, the interactive role of erosion and cropland revegetation on soil enzyme activities and microbial nutrient limitations is less understood. To address this issue, we examined carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in bulk soils and microbial biomass, enzyme activities, and microbial nutrient limitations in the 0-200 cm soils in eroded and deposited landscapes occupied by cropland, revegetated forest, and grassland. The results showed that the activities of C-, N-, and P-acquiring enzymes were larger in the deposited landscape than in the eroded landscape for 0-20 cm soils in forest and grassland but not in cropland. Microbial metabolism was co-limited by N and P, and the threshold element ratio (TERL) indicated that P was the most limiting factor. Microbial N limitation was lower in the deposited than the eroded zone, especially in surface soils in revegetated forest and grassland. The TERL value was larger at the deposited than at the eroded zone, and a greater difference was found in the surface soils of forest and grassland. Microbial nutrient limitations were mostly explained by C/P and N/P. Conclusively, the deposited areas were characterized by ameliorated enzyme activities, decreased microbial N limitation but relatively strengthened microbial P limitation compared to the eroded area, and such variations existed in the revegetated forest and grassland but not in the cropland, which thus contributes to a better understanding of C and nutrient cycling for agroecosystems and revegetation ecosystems in eroded environments.

The objective of the study was to determine whether landraces are better adapted to water-limited environments compared to commercial cultivars. Irrigation levels and genotypes affected plant height and leaf area index, with 25% and 33% higher values observed under complete irrigation, respectively. Additionally, limited water availability resulted in a 20% reduction in dry matter yield and a 21% reduction in essential oil yield over the three years in all of the genotypes tested, specifically in the lower irrigation treatment (d(40)), compared to the control treatment (d(100)). The landraces that performed the best under limited water supply were Athos white spike (AWS) and Gigas white spike (GWS), indicating their suitability for environments with limited water resources. The results demonstrate that there are landraces that can be utilized in dryland climates with appropriate water management, enabling water conservation and utilization of fields in water-scarce areas for irrigation purposes.																				2223-7747				JUL	2023	12	13							2425	10.3390/plants12132425	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants12132425								37446986					WOS:001028674400001

We evaluated root development of 37 durum wheat genotypes (modern cultivars and landraces) in the field at the adult plant stage, through a shovelomics approach. Large genotypic variability was found for root traits. Differences between the landraces and modern cultivars were the main driver of this variation, with landraces showing higher plant vigor for roots and shoots. Nonetheless, genotypic variation within groups was also observed, related to different models of root growth, largely independent of total root length. These two models represented root growth were oriented either to occupy more soil volume, or to occupy less soil volume with increased density. The field results were then compared with root data previously collected in seedlings using a filter paper-based method, to assess whether early root anticipated adult root features. Field plants showed a narrower root angle than seedlings. In particular, landraces presented a narrower root angle than cultivars, but only at seedling stage. Potentially useful correlations were found between the two growth stages for root length and number.

J	dos Santos, JYG; Nascimento, RQ				Gomes dos Santos, Jose Yure; Nascimento, Rafael Queiros			Effects of changes in soil use and occupation on soil losses in the Rio de Janeiro basin, West of Bahia	BOLETIN GOIANO DE GEOGRAFIA												The use and occupation of the soil is a preponderant factor for the attenuation or intensification of erosive processes, since areas that have an adequate soil cover present less potential to produce sediments. Thus, the present work aims to carry out an analysis of soil losses in the Rio de Janeiro Basjn (Western Bahia Region) for different conditions of land use and occupation, using USLE in a GIS environment. In which it was found that the Rio de Janeiro Basin has undergone an intense change in its use and land occupation in the last 40 years, with suppression of about 54% of the area of native vegetation, which significantly influenced the increase soil losses in the basin. The western portion of the basin was more susceptible to soil losses due to the higher concentration of the dryland farming class. In contrast, the eastern region of the basin showed the lowest values of soil losses due to the predominance of native vegetation, thus showing its effectiveness in mitigating erosion processes.																			0101-708X	1984-8501					2021	41	1							e65397	10.5216/BGG.v41.65397	http://dx.doi.org/10.5216/BGG.v41.65397													WOS:000740329800006
J	Ziegler, R				Ziegler, Rafael			Paludiculture as a critical sustainability innovation mission	RESEARCH POLICY												Paludiculture is the productive use of wet and rewetted peatlands. A major motivation is climate change, because drained peatlands contribute significant amounts of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The study presents an analysis of paludiculture as a critical sustainability innovation mission in the making. It is based on qualitative interviews conducted in 2018 in the north-east of Germany as well as on subsequent regional and European level stakeholder workshops focused on wet agriculture options for rewetted mires and other types of wetlands. A social grid approach of cognitive frames, institutions and social networks and their interplay is used to analyse paludiculture options for currently drained mires. The analysis suggests a pathway of paludiculture as land use at the margins of intensive, dryland agriculture. It also points to strategies for paludiculture to move from the margin to a transformation pathway, based on the use of framing, institutional conversion and productive niche work. The study proposes a 3Ms-schema of mission, modes and making innovation as a device to create space for a wide and inclusive discussion of paludiculture.

The effects of irrigation on carbon balance in an irrigated grazed pasture system in New Zealand	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												In New Zealand, increasing areas of dryland farming are being converted to irrigated farming, and there are conflicting findings whether this will lead to gains or losses of soil organic carbon (SOC). In this study, we used 2 years of eddy-covariance data from an irrigated, grazed dairy pasture in Canterbury, New Zealand and compared observed gas exchange fluxes to those from the process-based CenW model. CenW simulations agreed very well with observations for evapotranspiration, gross primary production, and ecosystem respiration rates with Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiencies similar to 0.8-0.9 for daily and weekly mean values. Model efficiency for net ecosystem productivity was similar to 0.7-0.8 for daily and weekly averages. The mean simulated net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) over the 2 year period was 0.6 t C ha(-1) y(-1) which was comparable to the measured NECB of 1.0 +/- 0.3 t C ha(-1) y(-1). The model also highlighted some processes where current understanding is incomplete. We found that gross primary production (GPP) was substantially reduced after grazing. While some GPP reduction was expected due to reduced leaf area, measured rates were only about half (reduced by a further similar to 30 kg C ha(-1) d(-1)) of that expected due to reduced leaf area alone. This probably resulted from the combined effect of trampling damage by cattle, a minor contribution of foliage coverage by dung pats, and some additional leaf physiological effect when previously shaded parts of the foliage were suddenly exposed to full sun to which they were not fully adapted. GPP then gradually recovered over the subsequent 2 weeks. CenW was then used to compare SOC levels after 50 years of irrigated dairy farming with those under a nonirrigated system. We found that SOC responses to irrigation interacted strongly with imposed grazing patterns. When we used the same grazing regime under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions, the application of irrigation resulted in a small increase of 4 +/- 3 t C ha(-1) (mean +/- standard error) over the range of weather conditions typical for this site. However, with this grazing management, the non-irrigated system had very low productivity (< 0.1 t C ha(-1) y(-1) in animal products). When dryland pasture was combined with a grazing regime typical for rain-fed systems, simulated long-term SOC stocks were increased by 13.9 +/- 1.5 t C ha(-1) under the irrigated system. This highlights the importance of considering the whole management system rather than looking at individual practices in isolation.

The current study estimated potential cotton development and baseline yield (maximum given no production constraints) using total heat units (THU) and potential cotton yield (PCY), respectively. Calculations were based on heat units (HU) for a 30-year (1984-2013) period. Long-term average THU and PCY, as well as PCY at three different exceedance probabilities (p=0.99, p=0.80, and p=0.75), were calculated for 21 selected weather stations across cotton-growing areas of Uzbekistan. After confirmation that the current planting date (April 15) is optimal, a comparison of THU with the accepted cotton production cutoff threshold (1444 degrees C) suggested that areas with lower elevations and latitudes are more appropriate for cotton production. Yield gap analysis (relative difference between long-term average PCY and actual yields) confirmed that Uzbekistan cotton production is below potential, while the spatial distribution of yield gaps outlined where efforts should be targeted. Areas near the stations of Nukus, Kungrad, Chimbay, and Syrdarya should be further investigated as benefit/cost ratio is highest in these areas. A comparison between state-set yield targets and PCY values, taking into account climatic variability, suggested that all areas except Jaslyk, Nurata, and Samarkand have safe, appropriate targets. These results present a starting-point to aid in strategic actions for Uzbekistan cotton production improvement.

How water quality is affected by the dry climate and socio-economic influences in Australia remains widely unknown. Here, we find that agriculture activity dominates reactive nitrogen (N-r) emissions to water bodies. Such emissions not only contribute to deteriorating water quality in Southeastern Australia but also harm marine ecosystems, including the Great Barrier Reef, a World Natural Heritage site. A dry and warm climate reduces the share of N-r emitted directly to water bodies; however, it increases the N-r concentration in surface water due to reduced water volume, leading to a 3-fold higher water N-r concentration compared to major rivers globally, e.g., in the US or China. Business-as-usual socioeconomic development would increase the total N-r emitted to surface water by at least 43% by 2050, while effective mitigation measures could reduce N runoff by about 27%. Advanced agricultural management strategies should be considered to reduce future environmental pressures due to N runoff in Australia.					xu, jianmin/G-8032-2012; Zhang, Xiuming/IUQ-0972-2023; Gu, Baojing/D-2299-2013; Zhang, Xiuming/ABF-2644-2021; Reis, Stefan/E-4713-2011	Zhang, Xiuming/0000-0002-1961-3339; Gu, Baojing/0000-0003-3986-3519; Zhang, Xiuming/0000-0002-1961-3339; Reis, Stefan/0000-0003-2428-8320													0013-936X	1520-5851				DEC 21	2021	55	24					16455	16464		10.1021/acs.est.1c06242	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c06242		DEC 2021						34882400					WOS:000731035700001

Results showed that dry matter (DM) content, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF) of whole silage maize increased significantly (P < 0.05), water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content of in 3/4 milk line stage was significantly lower than that in other harvesting stages (P < 0.05), and the CP content of 1/4 milk line stage and relative feed value (RFV) of late milk stage were the maximum, respectively; With the delay of the mowing period, the content of DM, NDF and ADF in the third crop of alfalfa increased significantly (P < 0.05), while the CP content decreased significantly (P < 0.05), the harvest period with the highest RFV was at the early flowering period. To sum up, silage corn can be harvested at the end of milk maturity to early wax maturity, and the third crop of alfalfa can be harvested at the early flowering stage, so that silage materials with high nutritional value can be obtained. The corn silage harvested in late september the best harvest period was mixed with alfalfa at the ratio of 10:0, 8:2, 6:4, 5:5, 4:6, 2:8, 0:10, and the mixed silage was fermented for 60 days, then proceeded determination of silage quality, and the principal component analysis (PCA) was used to analyze 10 nutritional quality indicators of 7 different mixed ratios. The results showed that compared with alfalfa silage alone, in the mixed silage of alfalfa and corn silage, with the increase of the proportion of corn silage, the fermentation quality of silage was gradually improved. Sensory evaluation scores and RFV values were higher, WSC and lactic acid (LA) contents were significantly increased (P < 0.05), and pH and ammonia nitrogen (AN) content were significantly decreased (P < 0.05). The in vitro gas productions ( IVGP, at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 h) were measured, the results showed that IVGP increased with the increase of silage corn mixed ratio. In summary, the effects of the harvest period of silage corn and alfalfa and different mixing ratios of silage on the quality of silage provide a theoretical basis for improving the quality of silage and rationally developing and utilizing feed resources, so as to be better applied to actual production.																			0377-8401	1873-2216				DEC	2023	306								115796	10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2023.115796	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2023.115796		NOV 2023											WOS:001107755100001

Lessons learnt from plant translocations can inform future translocations and improve conservation outcomes via adaptive management. We assessed translocation success for 76 translocations of 50 species established as part of recovery programmes between 1998 and 2016 in the Southwest Australian Floristic Region (SWAFR), a biodiversity hotspot with Mediterranean-type climate. We used a series of Bayesian hierarchical models to assess translocation success as measured by plant survival, height growth, crown growth, and reproduction (flowering and fruiting). We found that fencing to prevent vertebrate herbivory improved survival, irrigating plants over the first two summer dry periods improved the likelihood of reproduction, and where the rainfall increased above the 30-year average in the two years following planting, it positively influenced survival, growth, and reproduction. We recommend that fencing to prevent herbivory should be broadly considered in threatened plant translocations, while irrigation to improve translocation success would benefit plant species in Mediterranean-type ecosystems and other dryland environments.

The main objectives of the study are to analyze and determine the concentration of heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, and Pb) in soil, drinking water, and fish samples in Nigeria. Material and Methods: Soil, water, and fish samples were randomly taken from different regions in Nigeria. The heavy metals analysis of all the samples was carried out using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry in the Center for Dryland Agriculture, Bayero University, Kano, Kano State, Nigeria. Results: These heavy metals were at different levels of contamination, and some are above the maximum permissible limit. It could be said that they are the contributors to the kidney problem of the population of studies. Conclusions: The root cause of chronic kidney disease is related to those metals as their levels were higher in some of the samples than the maximum permissible limit of the local and international standards.

Agricultural acceleration of soil carbonate weathering	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Soil carbonates (i.e., soil inorganic carbon or SIC) represent more than a quarter of the terrestrial carbon pool and are often considered to be relatively stable, with fluxes significant only on geologic timescales. However, given the importance of climatic water balance on SIC accumulation, we tested the hypothesis that increased soil water storage and transport resulting from cultivation may enhance dissolution of SIC, altering their local stock at decadal timescales. We compared SIC storage to 7.3 m depth in eight sites, each having paired plots of native vegetation and rain-fed croplands, and half the sites having additional irrigated cropland plots. Rain-fed and irrigated croplands had 328 and 730 Mg C/ha less SIC storage, respectively, compared to their native vegetation (grassland or woodland) pairs, and irrigated croplands had 402 Mg C/ha less than their rain-fed pairs (p < .0001). SIC contents were negatively correlated with estimated groundwater recharge, suggesting that dissolution and leaching may be responsible for SIC losses observed. Under croplands, the remaining SIC had more modern radiocarbon and a delta C-13 composition that was closer to crop inputs than under native vegetation, suggesting that cultivation has led to faster turnover and incorporation of recent crop carbon into the SIC pool (p < .0001). The losses occurred just 30-100 years after land-use changes, indicating SIC stocks that were stable for millennia can rapidly adjust to increased soil water flows. Large SIC losses (194-242 Mg C/ha) also occurred below 4.9 m deep under irrigated croplands, with SIC losses lagging behind the downward-advancing wetting front by similar to 30 years, suggesting that even deep SIC were affected. These observations suggest that the vertical distribution of SIC in dry ecosystems is dynamic on decadal timescales, highlighting its potential role as a carbon sink or source to be examined in the context of land use and climate change.

It is estimated as the average annual value of the sum of all erosive events (EI30) over a period of many years. For each storm event, the EI30 value is the product of storm energy, E in MJ ha(-1), and peak 30-min rainfall intensity (I-30, mm hr(-1)). Previous studies often focused on estimation of the R factor for prediction of mean annual or long-term soil losses. However, many applications require EI30 values at much higher temporal resolution, such as postfire soil erosion monitoring, which requires a time step at storm events or on a daily basis. In this study, we explored the use of radar rainfall data to estimate the storm event-based EI30 after a severe wildfire in Warrumbungle National Park in eastern Australia. The radar-derived rainfall data were calibrated against 12 tipping bucket rain gauges across an area of 239 km(2) and subsequently used to produce a time series of rainfall erosivity maps at daily intervals since the wildfire in January 2013. The radar-derived daily rainfall showed good agreement with the gauge measurements (R-2 > 0.70, E-c = 0.66). This study reveals great variation in EI30 values ranging from near zero to 826.76 MJ center dot mm center dot ha(-1)center dot hr(-1) for a single storm event. We conclude that weather radar rainfall data can be used to derive timely EI30 and erosion information for fire incident management and erosion control. The methodology developed in this study is generic and thus readily applicable to other areas where weather radar data are available.					yang, xihua/AAD-9855-2022; Yu, Qiang/D-3702-2009; Yu, Bofu/G-5184-2010; Nolan, Rachael/R-8982-2019; du, zheyuan/P-2523-2015	Yu, Qiang/0000-0001-6950-1821; Yu, Bofu/0000-0001-7266-4197; Nolan, Rachael/0000-0001-9277-5142; du, zheyuan/0000-0002-8294-9636; Zhu, Qinggaozi/0000-0002-2371-4626													1085-3278	1099-145X				JAN 15	2019	30	1					33	48		10.1002/ldr.3146	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.3146													WOS:000454406600004

Garnys: An underwater riverine site with delayed Neolithisation in the southeastern Baltic	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS												This paper presents the first results of both dryland and underwater investigations at the multi-period Garnys riverine site situated on the.Zeimena River in eastern Lithuania. There, during 2017-2020 a professional diver and amateur archaeologist collected hundreds of Mesolithic-Neolithic archaeological finds made of wood, bone, antler, stone, and ceramic from the riverbed and on its bank. Moreover, in eroded places of the riverbed, the wooden remains of several fish weirs were observed. In 2021 professional archaeologists continued the research, including field investigations followed by various laboratory analyses. These included AMS 14C dating of 16 various ecofacts, artefacts and wooden constructions, wood and animal taxa determinations, and the results of traceological analysis of the flint and osseous artefacts. Our research demonstrates that the site was intensively used for hunting, gathering and fishing during the Mesolithic and subsequent Subneolithic and Neolithic. Intriguingly, there was no evidence for agriculture, while the numerous Neolithic ceramics largely follow the Subneolithic traditions. The Garnys site is therefore unique and a clear example for delayed Neolithisation in a forested and lacustrine area in the eastern Baltic region. During the Metal Ages, the site had been used exclusively for stationary fishing.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal spore density and root colonization in cochineal-infested Opuntia ficus-indica plants in northern Ethiopia	ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS												Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and herbivore insects are essential elements of ecosystems. They can influence each other on their common host plant. AMF support the plant growth by protecting against herbivore insect stresses. Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) miller is a multipurpose species which is under serious threat by cochineal insect (Dactylopius coccus (C.). The AMF and cochineal insect interaction on O. ficus-indica plants were not studied. This paper analyzed AMF spore density and root colonization of O. ficus-indica population in cochineal-infested and uninfested cultivated areas. Soil depth, season, and altitude were main environmental factors for the result observations. Soil and root samples were collected from the rhizosphere of O. ficus-indica plants. AMF spore density and root colonization were higher in uninfested plants than cochineal infested. AMF genus significantly varied along altitude and soil depth. Root colonization was higher during the rainy season than dry season, while spore density was lower in the rainy season. In the cochineal infested populations, spore density did not significantly varied with seasons. Spore density and root colonization were significantly higher on the upper soil depth than lower depth. Rhizosphere soil properties varied with altitude and soil depth. Soil available phosphorus (AVP) was significantly higher in the cochineal-infested populations. AVP showed significant negative correlation with mycorrhizal colonization. AMF-cochineal interaction in O. ficus-indica populations needs to be experimentally tested to understand the facilitative role of AMF to increase the performance of O. ficus-indica plants and to defend against the infestation of cochineal.						kebede, Teame/0000-0002-3875-5594													1872-8855	1872-8847				DEC	2023	17	6					839	854		10.1007/s11829-023-10005-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11829-023-10005-w		OCT 2023											WOS:001084636600001

However, the biogeography of soil fungi in the forest ecosystem is poorly understand, especially in arid or semiarid areas. Here, a regional scale study in an arid area was conducted on the Loess Plateau to illustrate the geographic distributions of soil fungi and their driving forces. The results showed that Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Zygomycota were the most dominant phyla in 24 sample sites. Fungal Shannon diversity and OTUs richness were significantly correlated with mean annual precipitation (MAP), total soil nitrogen (TN), ammonium nitrogen (NH4N) and soil organic carbon (SOC) levels. The decay-curve analysis demonstrated that soil fungal Bray-Cutis dissimilarities were significantly regressed with geographic distance, revealing that the soil fungal community structure was affected by historical factors. Variation partitioning analysis revealed that the soil properties (15%) contributed more to the fungal community variations than geographic distance (9%). Additionally, there were many predictors of soil fungi geography that were not detected. These results suggest that the fungal geography on the Loess Plateau is mainly regulated by soil properties or other unmeasured variables. Such findings advance our understanding of fungal diversity patterns on the Loess Plateau, which will help us better understand the functions and services in underground ecosystems in arid areas.						quanchao, zeng/0000-0003-1272-0227													0341-8162	1872-6887				DEC	2019	183								104220	10.1016/j.catena.2019.104220	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2019.104220													WOS:000488417700026
J	Wu, L; Li, XP; Ma, XY				Wu, Lei; Li, Xiaopin; Ma, Xiaoyi			Particulate nutrient loss from drylands to grasslands/forestlands in a large-scale highly erodible watershed	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Land use structure is an important factor affecting soil nutrient loss but the influencing mechanism of land use change on particulate nutrient loss is still unclear in large-scale ecological restoration regions. In this study, an integrated, physically-based modeling framework was put forward to identify the dynamic effects of land use change on particulate nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loss in Jinghe River Watershed (JRW), China. Results indicate that: (i) The proposed modeling framework is a robust tool for quantifying the dynamic effects of land use change on particulate nutrient loss and evaluating agricultural planting stategies at multiple spatial and temporal scales; (ii) The increase of dry land and low-coverage grassland, and the decrease of forestland and high- and middle-coverage grassland from 1985 to 1995 led to a sharp increase of particulate N and P loss load, which increased by 39.06% and 42.69% respectively. (iii) The significant decrease in both dry land and low-coverage grassland from 1995 to 2005 caused the decrease of particulate N and P loss load by 28.22% and 31.99% respectively. This is because the forestland increased but dryland decreased, and the low-coverage grassland was transformed into middle- and high-coverage grassland during this period; and (iv) There was no decrease but increase by 13.65% and 13.50% for particulate N and P loss from 2005 to 2010 because the erosive rainstorm and runoff volume in 2010 were both larger than that in 2005. Results provide effective data support for scientific decision-makers and land management practices in the loess hilly and gully region.					wu, lei/D-3286-2017; Wu, Lei/JDC-4172-2023; Ma, Xiaoyi/HJH-6205-2023	wu, lei/0000-0002-5602-674X; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2019	107								105673	10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105673	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105673													WOS:000490757500112

However, how a single gene integrates both ROS and SA pathways remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Arabidopsis WRKY55 transcription factor positively regulates ROSand SA accumulation, and thus leaf senescence and resistance against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. WRKY55 is predominantly expressed in senescent leaves and encodes a transcriptional activator localized to nuclei. Both inducible and constitutive overexpression of WRKY55 accelerates leaf senescence, whereas mutants delay it. Transcriptomic sequencing identified 1448 differentially expressed genes, of which 1157 genes are upregulated by WRKY55 expression. Accordingly, the ROS and SA contents in WRKY55-overexpressing plants are higher than those in control plants, whereas the opposite occurs in mutants. Moreover, WRKY55 positively regulates defense against P. syringae. Finally, we show that WRKY55 activates the expression of RbohD, ICS1, PBS3 and SAG13 by binding directly to the W-box-containing fragments. Taken together, our work has identified a new WRKY transcription factor that integrates both ROS and SA pathways to regulate leaf senescence and pathogen resistance.

J	Wang, ZF; Zheng, FL				Wang, Zongfei; Zheng, Fenli			Impact of vegetation succession on leaf-litter-soil C:N:P stoichiometry and their intrinsic relationship in the Ziwuling Area of China's Loess Plateau	JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH												Long-term natural vegetation succession plays a substantial role in the accumulation and distribution of plant and soil C:N:P stoichiometry. However, how plant and soil C:N:P relationships or ratios change along with successional stages over a century in the severely eroded areas remain unclear. These were measured over a 100-year natural succession in five successional stages from annual grasses to climax forests. The results show that natural succession had significant effects on carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) concentrations in leaf-litter-soil and their ratios in severely eroded areas. Nitrogen concentrations and N:P ratios in leaf and litter increased from annual grasses to the shrub stage and then decreased in the late successional forest stages. Leaf P levels decreased from annual grasses to shrub stages and did not significantly change during late successional stages. Litter P concentration decreased in the early successional stages and increased during late successional stages, with no overall significant change. Soil C and N concentrations and C:N, C:P and N:P ratios increased with successional stages. Soil C and N concentrations decreased with the increasing soil depth. Both were significantly different between any successional stages and controls (cropland) in the upper 10 cm and 10-20 cm soil layers. Leaf N:P ratios may be used to indicate nutrient limitations and this study suggests that plant growth during the grass stages was limited by N, during the shrub stage, by P, and during the forest stages, by both of N and P. In addition, there were close correlations between litter and leaf C:N:P ratios, soil and litter C and N levels, and C:P and N:P ratios. These results show that long-term natural vegetation succession is effective in restoring degraded soil properties and improving soil fertility, and provide insights into C:N:P relationships of leaf, litter and soil influenced by vegetation succession stage.																			1007-662X	1993-0607				APR	2021	32	2					697	711		10.1007/s11676-020-01149-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-020-01149-z		MAY 2020											WOS:000534444900001

A., A. Pourmohammad, A.A. Aliloo, K. Alizadeh, M. B. Hassanpouraghdam (2021). Forage yield components of some tolerant and sensitive grass pea genotype seedlings affected by the salinity stress. -Genetika, Vol 53, No.1, 79-92. Grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) is relatively tolerant to several abiotic stresses such as salinity. Twenty-five grass pea genotypes provided by the Dryland Agricultural Research Institute, Maragheh, Iran, were exposed to four salinity levels (0, 40, 80, 120 mM). Based on the primary screen, 8 tolerant genotypes and 17 sensitive genotypes were selected. Principal components analysis for the sensitive and tolerant genotypes showed that the first four components explained approximately 71-80% of variance. In PCA, the coefficients associated with leaf showed that, in tolerant genotypes, leaf length and leaf number increased but, leaf width decreased. In other words, salinity stress makes the leaves grow larger and longer, but the width of the leaves decreases and angle of the leaf becomes tighter. So, these traits may be used as an index of salinity tolerance in grass pea selection programs. Cluster analysis based on Ward's algorithm and Euclidean distance measure effectively separated the tolerant and sensitive genotypes. Cut off dendrogram located tolerant genotypes (except one genotype) in the same subgroup. This fact shows that cluster analysis efficiently divided and/or separated semi-tolerant tolerant genotypes. Shoot dry weight had significant negative correlation with pH, plumule length and plantlet length. Path analysis on tolerant genotypes, revealed the direct effects of leaf number and pod number with shoot dry weight. In stepwise regression, two traits including leaf number and pod number were entered into the model. The results showed that leaf number and pod number had the most direct and positive effect on the shoot dry weight, and the plant height had the highest indirect effect through leaf number on the shoot dry weight. About sensitive genotypes, the results showed that leaf number and fruit fresh weight had the most direct and positive effect on the shoot dry weight, and the plant height had the highest indirect effect through leaf number on the shoot dry weight. Several characteristics were identified to explain shoot dry weight during path analysis. The selections based on the identified characters would be more effective in improving yield in the breeding programs of grass pea.

The semi-arid Khorchin area in Northeast China is an important production area for rain-fed maize. Drought stress occurs frequently, even if plastic film mulch is applied at sowing. We hypothesized that the yield and water capture of maize could be increased by reducing evaporative loss of water by use of plastic film cover during the autumn and winter preceding sowing. In this study, we compared maize growth, water uptake and yield in three film cover treatments: (1) film cover from the autumn before maize sowing until maize harvest (autumn mulching: AM), (2) film cover from maize sowing till harvest (conventional practice) (spring mulching: SM), (3) no film cover (no mulch: NM). Field experiments were conducted in Fuxin city, Khorchin region, Liaoning province, China in 2013/2014 and 2014/2015. Autumn mulching increased grain yield on average by 18% when compared to spring mulching and by 36% when compared to no mulching. The 1000-kernel weight in AM was 7% higher than in SM, and 12% higher than in NM. Soil water content in the root zone before sowing was 35 mm greater in AM than in SM and NM. Water uptake during the growing season was 34 mm greater in AM than in SM and NM. Water use efficiency for grain yield (yield per unit water uptake) in AM was on average 2.5% higher than in conventional mulching (SM) and 27% higher than in NM. Autumn mulching advanced development, with an advance of 5 days in tasseling time as compared to SM and 10 days when compared to NM. These results show that film cover during the fallow period before maize sowing can increase crop yield and water use efficiency, and reduce climate risks in rain-fed agriculture under semi-arid conditions.					feng, chen/JLM-8296-2023														0378-3774	1873-2283				FEB 1	2019	212						203	210		10.1016/j.agwat.2018.09.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2018.09.001													WOS:000448095900020

Forage value of vegetative leaf and stem biomass fractions of selected grasses indigenous to African rangelands	ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE												Context. Rangeland grasses native to Africa constitute the main diet for free-ranging livestock and wild herbivores. Leaf:stem ratio is a key characteristic used for assessing quality of forages. However, studies to determine the allocation of biomass to leaves and stems as well as chemical components and nutritive value, especially of grasses in African rangelands, are rare. Aim. This study was conducted to establish biomass allocation and chemical and mineral components in leaf and stem fractions of three grasses, Eragrostis superba, Enteropogon macrostachyus and Cenchrus ciliaris, all indigenous to African rangelands. Methods. Plant height, plant densities, plant tiller densities and biomass yields were estimated at the elongation stage, before inflorescence. Chemical and mineral components were determined from biomass harvested at the vegetative phase for all three grass species. Dry matter, ash content, organic matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre, acid detergent lignin, and calcium, phosphorus and potassium contents were determined. Key results. Enteropogon macrostachyus displayed significantly greater plant and tiller densities and plant height than the other two species. Leaf and stem biomass fractions varied significantly (P < 0.05) among grasses. Leaf:stem ratio of E. superba was double that of E. macrostachyus and C. ciliaris. Crude protein and organic matter yields and net energy for lactation were highest (P < 0.05) in E. superba leaf biomass, as was Ca content. Conclusions. Eragrostis superba demonstrated greater potential as a forage species for ruminant animal production than E. macrostachyus and C. ciliaris. Implications. Eragrostis superba is a key forage species that warrants promotion in pasture establishment programs in its native environments.

J	Zerboni, A; Nicoll, K				Zerboni, Andrea; Nicoll, Kathleen			Enhanced zoogeomorphological processes in North Africa in the human-impacted landscapes of the Anthropocene	GEOMORPHOLOGY					Annual Meeting of the American-Association-of-Geographers	2017	Boston, MA	Amer Assoc Geographers				New zoogeomorphological features discovered in dryland landscapes of Northern Africa reflect human-animal agency since prehistory, and attest to complex, networked activities over great distances. We discuss the role of zoogeomorphology in shaping Earth's surface since the beginning of the Anthropocene, the timeframe when natural processes shifted and landscape evolution became more human-dominated. We focus on contexts in arid and semiarid lands of Northern Africa, which are metastable, sensitive ecosystems that are prone to modifications triggered by climatic and anthropogenically forced factors. Studying the geoarchaeological record in context of landscape impact and animal procurement by people throughout Antiquity is important for reconstructing domestication and husbandry of cattle, sheep, and goats in this region. Among the features we recognize in association with transhumance, pastoralism, and herding are trails, trackways, footholds, animal day-beds, stables, animal dwellings, rockshelters, game blinds, and monuments, to name a few. Related activities with landscape-scale impacts include herding, transport, corralling and browsing of cattle (Bos sp.), goats, and sheep (ovicaprines) as well as pasturage activities like cropping, fire-setting, and manuring. These activities were disturbances that affected surface processes like erosion and dust mobilization, as well as reduced vegetation and ecosystems productivity. In dryland Africa, and especially in the Sahara, intensive herding led to the alteration of the pristine aspects of bare rock surfaces and of the stone desert pavement (i.e., the hamada); many regions preserved evidence of middle-late Holocene animal daybeds, trampled areas, and barren tracks and trails. We suggest that human and herd animal activities affected geomorphic surfaces that affected slope stability, intensified erosion and dust mobilization, and enhanced dust export from the African continent offshore. We reinterpret the increased dust emission from North Africa during the mid-Holocene at the end of the African Humid Period, as has been interpreted from ocean cores; aridification of the Green Sahara followed the insolation-forced monsoonal maximum, and was exacerbated by human-animal activities across the Sahara and the Sahel. We argue that the spread of human activities and intensive husbandry of cattle, and caprines (goat and sheep) in this region significantly influenced the geomorphic stability, ecosystem and landscape sustainability in a comparable manner of overuse observed in present-day arid and marginal environments, where pastoral overgrazing pressure increases erosion processes and enhances dust mobilization. We suggest that human-animal activities have amplified dust generation from the North African continental interior since similar to 7 ka BP. This evidence of prehistoric human impacts on surface processes in North Africa supports arguments for an early beginning of the Anthropocene. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

J	Yang, Y; Cheng, H; Dou, YX; An, SS				Yang, Yang; Cheng, Huan; Dou, Yanxing; An, Shaoshan			Plant and soil traits driving soil fungal community due to tree plantation on the Loess Plateau	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												It is widely accepted that soil fungi plays a crucial role in biogchemical cycle in terrestrial ecosystems, and soil fungal community can be shaped by plant and soil traits; however, we still know very little about the combined impacts of plant and soil traits on soil fungal community due to tree plantation, especially on the Loess Plateau. In doing so, we provided a conceptual framework bridging knowledge on plant, soil traits and soil fungal community, which tested the combined impacts of plant and soil traits on soil fungal community due to tree plantation compared with natural restoration (CK) on the Loess Plateau. There was a disproportionate influence of tree plantation on soil fungal community by using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) (p < 0.05) and the interaction networks. Additionally, soil organic carbon (SOC), soil pH, C/N, biomass in litter and root were highly related to the dominant soil fungal community (such as Ascomycota and Basidiomycota), which can be considered as the main drivers for soil fungal community. Most importantly, litter traits and root traits were considered as the key predictors in shaping soil fungal community in terms of tree plantation (especially litter and root C/N), while soil traits and root traits were considered as the key predictors in terms of natural restoration. Besides, structural equation modeling (SEM) indicated that soil fungal community was co-mediated by soil and plant traits due to tree plantation, and the total effects of soil traits, plant traits, litter traits and root traits on soil fungal community were higher in tree plantation, suggesting that tree plantation had a large effect on soil fungal community compared to natural restoration. Finally, we build a conceptual framework to clarify the combined impacts of plant and soil traits on soil fungal community, providing a new sight to understand the crucial role of plant and soil traits in shaping soil fungal community due to tree plantation, and the interactions among plant and soil and also soil fungal community need further studies.

At present, the sediment transport capacity prediction model for soils with a low median grain diameter is not fully understood. In this study, the T-c values of three different soils (median grain diameter d(50) = 0.015, 0.040, and 0.095 mm) were investigated by conducting indoor experiments at unit flow discharges of 0.19 - 1.89 x 10(-3) m(2)center dot s(-1) and slopes of 0.07-0.21. In addition, data describing the overland flow sediment transport capacity of black soil (d(50) = 0.01 mm) were obtained from Yu et al. (2018). First, the performance of seven shear stress, unit stream power, stream power, and mean flow velocity concept-based T-c equations were evaluated based on the measurements. The results confirmed that none of the existing formulas performed well over the entire experimental range. T-c equations derived using soils with a large particle size generally underestimate the T-c of soils containing small particles. The Zhang equation, when calibrated based on the data in this study, can predict overland flow T-c with a PoP of 66 % (PoP refers to the percentage of predictions in which the discrepancy ratio falls between 0.5 and 2.0, whilst the discrepancy ratio is the ratio of the predicted and measured T-c). Based on the general flow parameter concept, a more accurate T-c equation was developed for the four types of soils, which was characterized by a PoP of 83 %. When these equations are beyond the scope of their development conditions, they should be verified further.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				APR	2023	223								106929	10.1016/j.catena.2023.106929	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.106929		JAN 2023											WOS:000923058700001

The multi-scale method and the optimal scale method are two of the most widely used separation methods. In this study, we extend the optimal scale method to the multi-optimal-scale method, adaptively selecting multiple optimal scales for each point in the tree point cloud to increase the distinctiveness of extracted geometric features. Compared with the optimal scale method, our method achieves higher separation accuracy. Compared with the multi-scale method, our method achieves more stable separation accuracy with a limited number of optimal scales. The running time of our method is greatly reduced when the optimization strategy is applied.																				1424-8220				APR 2	2019	19	8							1852	10.3390/s19081852	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s19081852								31003452					WOS:000467644500106

TROPICAL GRASSLANDS-FORRAJES TROPICALES												The study aimed to evaluate the effects on the performance of lactating cows of different strategies for supplying diets based on cactus cladodes. Eight Girolando cows at 97 ?? 7.6 days into lactation, producing 12.2 ?? 0.26 kg milk/day, were assigned to 4 treatments in two 4 ?? 4 Latin squares. The feeding strategies were: total mixed ration (TMR) based on a mixture of concentrates, cactus cladodes [Opuntia stricta (Haw.) Haw.] and sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) fed after milking; concentrate fed during milking with cactus cladodes and sugarcane offered later (Con/CC+SC); cactus cladodes combined with concentrate fed after milking with sugarcane offered later (CC+Con/SC); and sugarcane combined with concentrate fed after milking with cactus cladodes offered later (SC+Con/CC). Intakes of neutral detergent fiber (NDF; 4.54 ?? 0.09 kg/d) and total digestible nutrients (TDN; 9.30 ?? 0.50 kg/d) were similar (P>0.05) for all feeding strategies and there was no effect of feeding strategy on milk yield (12.2 ?? 0.26 kg/d). The different feeding strategies did not change the ingestive behavior or performance of lactating Girolando cows. Since the shortage of labor prohibits the feeding of TMRs on family farms because of labor required for preparation, these rations would be appropriate only on large farms where the costs of machines to prepare diets efficiently might be available. Cows fed concentrate during milking spent longer to consume the concentrate than the time to milk, resulting in inefficient usage of scarce labor. Appropriate feeding strategies for family farms appear to be SC+Con/CC and CC+Con/SC, i.e. partial separation of dietary ingredients, and all feeding should be done after milking.

J	Wang, K; Zhang, XY; Zheng, JY; Wang, DD				Wang, Ke; Zhang, Xiaoyuan; Zheng, Jiyong; Wang, Dandan			Differences in Soil Organic Carbon Accumulation After 8 Years of Biochar Application with High and Low Rates	JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION												Soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation plays an important role for achieving the goals of Paris Agreement. Biochar has a negative or positive effects on SOC accumulation, which is related to soil aggregate fractions and structural characteristics of SOC. In this context, however, the information about the long-term effects of biochar application on SOC accumulation under field conditions was scarce. The changes of SOC and its functional groups in bulk soil, aggregate stability, and the distribution of SOC in aggregate fractions were evaluated by means of 8 years' field experiment, in which biochar (derived from apple branches pyrolyzed at 550 degree celsius) was applied into soil at the rates of 1% (B1), 3% (B3), and 5% (B5) (w/w), and took the soil without biochar application as the control treatment (CK). Compared with CK, B3 and B5 increased the > 250-mu m fraction (macroaggregate) and decreased the < 53-mu m fraction and ultimately increased the aggregate stability by 16.9% and 35.3%, respectively. The B3 and B5 significantly increased the SOC in all aggregate fractions. However, B1 had no significant effects on soil aggregate fractions and the associated C. For macro- and micro-aggregates, the aromatic-C was higher and polysaccharide-C was lower in B3 and B5 than in CK, while these were opposite in B1. Compared with the first year, the SOC in the eighth year under CK and B1 was decreased by 0.47 and 3.36 g kg(-1) respectively, while the one under B3 and B5 was increased by 1.55 and 7.59 g kg(-1), respectively. The long-term application of biochar with 3% and 5% rates (but not 1% rate) is conducive to the accumulation of SOC of clay loam soil, which is further beneficial to enhance the soil carbon pool stability.

Yet, it is unclear how the intercropped legume mediates the fate and benefits of fertilizer N in plastic film mulched cereal field.Methods: A two-year field experiment was conducted with cropping patterns, including maize monoculture, soybean monoculture and maize-soybean intercropping, with N levels (0, 180 and 225 kg N ha-1 for maize; 0 and 40 kg N ha-1 for soybean), and with and without plastic film mulching in maize.Results: Both data qualification from the methods of N-difference and 15N isotope tracer confirmed that maize had a great enhancement of NUE when intercropped with soybean. The use of 180 kg N ha-1 with film mulching for intercropped maize resulted in the highest NUE with 61% 15N recovery, 40% N agronomic efficiency and 91 kg grain kg-1 N partial productivity. Under no mulching, intercropped maize with 180 kg N ha-1 had a 28% higher 15N recovery and 43% less 15N loss with 12% more fertilizer 15N allocation into maize grain than monoculture maize with 225 kg N ha-1. To some extent, this effect was amplified by film mulching. Interestingly, film mulching caused an overuse of soil-derived N in maize, and in this regard, an influence of 67.3% was eliminated by soybean-based intercropping. This deficiency of N was compensated by enhancing the use of fertilizer-derived N and soybean-transferred N (30 kg N ha-1) under low-N rate. The intercropping pattern FM180S40, i.e. film mulched maize with 180 kg N ha-1 and soybean with 40 kg N ha-1, had the highest N fertilization efficiency (FNER=1.29) due to the high land use efficiency (LER=1.19) and maize yield (14 Mg ha-1) with less N fertilizer use.Conclusions: Soybean-based intercropping and film mulching sustained a 20% reduction of N fertilizer based on the optimized N level (225 kg N ha-1) for dryland maize. This further induced a great intercropping advantage of N fertilization efficiency via high NUE of maize and positive processes of NUE formation in maize strips.

J	Dou, YX; Yang, Y; An, SS				Dou, Yanxing; Yang, Yang; An, Shaoshan			Above-Ground Biomass Models of Caragana korshinskii and Sophora viciifolia in the Loess Plateau, China	SUSTAINABILITY												The quantification of above-ground biomass is based on the calculation of carbon storage, which is important for the balance of carbon cycling. However, the allometric models of shrubs for calculating the above-ground biomass of shrubs in the Loess Plateau are scarce. In order to solve this issue, this study analyzed some highly correlated variables, including height (H), branch diameters (D), canopy volume (C-v), canopy area (C-a), and then built a regression model to predict the above-ground biomass in two common shrubs (Caragana korshinskii and Sophora viciifolia) in the Loess Plateau, China. The results show that the above-ground biomass of these two shrubs can be accurately predicted by H and D, and then we can use allometric model (y = ax(b)) to calculate shrub above-ground biomass (including leaf biomass and branch biomass). Furthermore, the correlation between leaf biomass and branch biomass in Caragana korshinskii and Sophora viciifolia indicates that the components of above-ground biomass are closely related to each other. In addition, there is a strong linear relationship (p < 0.01) between the observed and estimated biomass values, which confirms the data accuracy of the above-ground biomass estimation models. In summary, these two biomass estimation models provide an accurate way to estimate the quantification of carbon for shrubs in the Loess Plateau.

An experiment was conducted at slopes of 12.23%, 17.63%, 26.8%, 36.4%, 40.4% and 46.63% under rainfall intensities of 48, 60, 90, 120, 138 and 150 mm h(-1), respectively, by using simulated rainfall. Results showed that the soil detachment rate by raindrop-affected sediment-laden sheet flow decreased as the sediment load by sheet flow increased, and the decrease was a power function of sediment load by sheet flow with NSE = 0.58, MSE = 0.0099 and R-2 = 0.58. In addition, the soil detachment rate by raindrop-affected sediment-laden sheet flow increased as a linear function of shear stress, stream power and unit stream power. Shear stress and stream power could be used to predict the soil detachment rate by raindrop-affected sediment-laden sheet flow accurately through a linear equation. Stream power (R-2 = 0.87, MSE = 0.003 and NSE = 0.87) was a better predictor of soil detachment rate by raindrop-affected sediment-laden sheet flow than shear stress (NSE = 0.83, MSE = 0.004 and R-2 = 0.83). However, prediction based on unit stream power (NSE = 0.43, MSE = 0.01 and R-2 = 0.43) was poor. These findings can improve our understanding and modelling of sheet erosion processes on steep slopes in the loess region of China.

Soybean yield response to <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> inoculation on southeastern coastal plain soils	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is an important process to supply nitrogen (N) for the crop. However, the N fixation capacity of soybean varies widely among soils and climatic conditions. The N fixation potential is purportedly minimum in soils that do not have any prior history of soybean cultivation, and the application of inoculum is reported as necessary to facilitate this process. Rhizobium inocula can be applied at planting to promote BNF; however, their efficacy remains highly variable. A field experiment was conducted at irrigated and dryland sites in 2017 and 2018, where soybean was not cultivated in the preceding 10+ years. Bradyrhizobium inoculum was applied in liquid, dry, and a combination of liquid and dry formulations. The results showed that inoculum addition, in any formulation or combination, did not significantly increase soybean yield compared with the untreated control at any site. This study showed that inoculum application did not consistently increase yield in fields without soybean in the previous crop rotation for years. Future research is needed to identify soils, varieties, management practices, and environmental conditions for soybean inoculation which can increase yield and net farm profits.

The evapotranspiration of Hetao irrigation District is very large, and the WUE of this area is affected by many factors. At present, the correlation analysis of multi factor interaction has not been carried out. A comparison of the spatiotemporal patterns as well as the impact of meteorological factors on the WUE of ecosystems (WUEe) and the WUE of canopies (WUEc) in the Hetao Irrigation District can provide a fundamental basis for water management at the basin level, especially in dryland irrigation areas. Trend analysis indicated that the trends of WUEe and WUEc had opposite directions, namely, the increase in WUEe concealed the decrease in WUEc based on the application of remotely sensed GPP and ET products in the Hetao Irrigation District. In addition, WUEe and WUEc had different responses to meteorological factors. The interactive influence of multiple climate factor interactions on WUE was greater than the influence of single factors. The identification of the response of WUE to meteorological factors can provide a scientific basis for farmland water replenishment in arid areas.																			0140-1963	1095-922X				OCT	2022	205								104822	10.1016/j.jaridenv.2022.104822	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2022.104822		JUN 2022											WOS:000829856000001

Therefore, urban planning in these regions should be based on comprehensive understanding of the constraints and vulnerabilities of arid lands. In this study, the sustainability condition of a rapidly growing city in a dry landscape, Yazd, Iran, was assessed using a previously developed framework. The framework is based on the conceptual principle of close relations between structure and function and is comprised of three main components and 16 metrics. By evaluating the status and trends of these metrics, and using the analytical hierarchy process method, the score of Yazd sustainability was determined as 0.28 out of 1.0, indicating the city is far from a state of sustainability. Current urban development policies in this region exacerbate unstable conditions. Given the constraints on achieving urban sustainability in arid regions, physical urban development should be aligned with local ecological potential. In the process of urban growth, local knowledge and ecological values in these areas must be protected. Applying this sustainability assessment process in other dryland cities will improve this evaluative framework and help achieve rational principles for sustainable urban development strategies in arid lands.

However, the contribution of individual driving factors and the detailed spatial distribution of sediment load at a catchment scale were not well understood. In the study, we quantitatively assessed the relative contributions of individual climatic (i.e. precipitation) and anthropogenic (i.e. vegetation restoration, terrace construction) driving factors to sediment load variations in the largest tributary of the Yellow River, Weihe River. The employed annual sediment load measurements and rainfall data for 1961-2015 were collected at 15 hydrological and 60 meteorological stations that were widely distributed in the basin. Changing trends, periodicity, and abrupt changes of hydro-climatic variables were detected using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test, the empirical mode decomposition method, and Pettitt's test. Results showed that annual sediment load presented significantly decreasing trends at 12 hydrological stations. Annual rainfall erosivity showed a mixed tendency, with the changing trends varying among different regions. A 3-year periodicity was identified in the annual sediment load at three main stream gauging stations. Abrupt changing points in sediment load primarily occurred in the 1990s and early 2000s at all of the 15 hydrological stations, which were largely attributed to human activities. The increase in vegetation cover was responsible for approximately 40.6%, 37.4%, and 54.7% of the sediment load reduction in the main stream of the Weihe River, the Jinghe River, and the Beiluohe River, respectively. Meanwhile, terrace construction accounted for 19.7%, 43.8%, and 9.9% of the sediment variation, respectively. Conversely, precipitation change accounted for 5.7%, 12.4%, and 8.3% of sediment load reduction, respectively. Overall, vegetation restoration and terrace construction were found to be the two dominating factors for sediment load reduction in the study area.

Increasing fertilization may profoundly affect community stability, whereas the underlying compensatory dynamics among functional groups in regulating grassland stability remain unclear. Three different grasslands, annuals forb (AF) community, perennial grass (PG) community and perennial forb (PF) community, on semiarid Loess Plateau were selected. We designed a 3-year split-plot experiment (main-plot: 0, 25, 50, and 100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1); subplot: 0, 20, 40 and 80 kg P2O5 ha(-1) yr(-1)) to explore how N and P addition affects community stability and its relationship with species richness, species asynchrony and functional group stability. Temporal stability differed largely between functional groups under N and P addition, perennial forbs or grasses had higher stability than perennial legumes or annuals and biennials. Decreased stability of PG and PF communities was primarily due to reduced species asynchrony under N addition alone, while it attributed to increased dominance of perennial legumes after P addition alone. 50 and 100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) combined with P addition significantly increased dominance of annuals and biennials, but decreased stability of annuals and biennials. which caused significant declines in stability of the three communities. Significant species richness decline induced by N and P addition only occurred in AF community, which suppressed AF community stability through reducing species asynchrony. AF community stability was regulated by additively negative effect of diversity decline and decreased annuals and biennials stability. Whereas, in PG and PF communities, nutrient-induced changes of functional groups stability were the main driver of community stability rather than diversity. Our study highlights the role of functional group composition and dynamics in regulating the effects of diversity on community stability and rational N and P combined addition was essential for conserving stability of different grasslands on semiarid Loess Plateau.

Plastic film mulching (PM) plays a dominant role in increasing crop yields in dryland agriculture worldwide. The functional guilds of soil fungi under PM and their effects on crops remain unclear. In this study, we explored the absolute abundance, diversity, community composition, and functional guilds of soil fungi after short-term (2 years) and long-term (10 years) mulching experiments. Short-term mulching caused a 37 %-51 % decrease in absolute fungal abundance owing to abrupt changes in the microenvironment. The response of the fungal commu-nity to PM varied with sites, with the effect being more pronounced under poor hydrothermal conditions (314 mm). The abundance of potential fungal pathogens decreased under PM; for example, Gibberella (maize ear rot) abundance was 45 % and 72 % lower under short-and long-term mulching, respectively, when compared with that in control. In contrast, the abundance of plant biocontrol fungi increased under PM; for instance, Glomeromycota abundance in-creased twofold under long-term mulching. Although PM did not alter the complexity and stability of fungal co-occurrence network, competition among fungi increased in the absence of sufficient carbon (C) sources. Long-term mulching reduced phytopathogen guilds by 12 %-77 % and increased arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) guilds by 89 %-94 %. Structural equation modeling suggested that PM altered fungal functional guilds mainly by shaping the structure of the fungal community, and fungal pathogens decreased with increased AMF functional guilds, induc-ing higher maize yields. These results showed for the first time, from a microbial perspective, that pathogens reduction owing to PM could explain 4.4 % of maize yield variation, providing theoretical guidance to accomplish sustainability of continuous maize mulching.					wan, pingxing/HGE-3797-2022														0048-9697	1879-1026				FEB 25	2023	861								160615	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160615	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160615								36464048					WOS:000993664900001
J	Li, YP; Shao, MG; Wang, J; Li, TC				Li, Yanpei; Shao, Mingan; Wang, Jiao; Li, Tongchuan			Effects of Earthworm Cast Application on Water Evaporation and Storage in Loess Soil Column Experiments	SUSTAINABILITY												Earthworm cast is a common bio-organic fertiliser, which can effectively improve soil fertility and structure. However, only a few studies have focused on the effect of earthworm cast on soil water movement. In this study, loess soil was used to determine the effects of earthworm cast application on soil evaporation. The effects on water storage capacity and capillary upward movement were also investigated. A laboratory-based soil column experiment using earthworm cast with different particle sizes (1-3 x 1-2 cm and 3-5 x 2-4 cm) and three application doses (5%, 7.5%, and 10%) was carried out. The daily evaporation and volume of capillary ascension were monitored. The addition of earthworm cast clearly affected the soil evaporation by changing soil water storage capacity and capillary water upward movement. Compared with control soil, the application of 5% small-particle cast reduced the soil cumulative evaporation by 5.13%, while the cumulative evaporation was higher in all large-particle cast treatments. The upward capillary water movement increased with increasing dose of earthworm cast, but decreased with increasing particle size. Overall, the addition of earthworm cast clearly enhanced the water storage capacity of the soil, with the small-particle cast having greater effects than the large-particle cast. We concluded that the application of 5% small-particle earthworm cast can enhance soil water retention and reduce soil evaporation.																				2071-1050				APR	2020	12	8							3112	10.3390/su12083112	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12083112													WOS:000535598700045
J	Liang, YJ; Liu, LJ				Liang, You-jia; Liu, Li-jun			Vulnerability assessment of crop production to climate change across Northwest China during 1995-2014	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												Crop production vulnerability to climate change in Northwest China depends upon multiple socio-ecological factors. Knowledge regarding the specific indicators and methods suitable for assessing crop production vulnerability is limited that address spatiotemporal variations across large and diverse zones. We propose an integrated assessment framework to quantify the vulnerability of crop production derived from crop yield sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive consequences across 338 counties in Northwest Chinac during 1995-2014. Maps on these indices were generated using climatic and socioeconomic data with spatial mapping method. Different clusters of crop production vulnerability were then identified by a k-means cluster method to assess the heterogeneity of vulnerability at a regional scale. Results show that the vulnerability of crop production in 338 counties varies significantly in both geographical and socioeconomic aspects, specifically, vulnerability indicators are generally higher in Minhe, Menyuan, Hualong, and Ledu, and Xayar had the lowest value of vulnerability. This indicates that adaptation strategies for regional crop production need to focus on several levels, from the improvement of adaptive ability to crop yield fluctuation by promoting irrigation agriculture and optimizing limited water resources in typical arid areas, to agriculture-related financial policies incentivizing the capital investment and technology upgrade of crop production on traditional farming regions. This study provides convincing evidence that the factors related to socioeconomic policies are particularly alarming when a crop's risk is compared to precipitation fluctuations. We recommend these findings be used to facilitate regional agriculture planning to reduce crop production vulnerability and ensure sustainable food security in specific regions.

Conservation tillage rotation, conserved soil water and enhanced soil fertility effectively, produced high and stable crop yields in a spring maize-winter wheat-fallow rotation over a two-year period (hereafter called maize-wheat-fallow rotation). Corresponding and appropriate fertilization practices should enable the full potential of tillage rotation. Therefore, a long-term two-factor split-plot experiment (2007-2016) was established in Heyang County, Shaanxi Province, China, a typical rainfed dryland agricultural region. Beginning in 2007, three fertilization practices (balanced fertilization (BF), low fertilization (LF) and conventional fertilization (CF)) and four tillage systems (no tillage rotated with subsoiling annually (NS), subsoiling rotated with conventional tillage annually (SC), conventional tillage rotated with no tillage annually (CN), and continuous conventional tillage (CT)) were conducted to assess crop yield and soil water variation. The results showed that CCN (CF + CN, 5440 kg ha(-1)) and BNS (BF + NS, 8415 kg ha(-1)) produced the highest crop yield for winter wheat and spring maize, respectively. LNS (LF + NS, 419 mm) had a better soil water condition in fallow periods. NS and CN rotations had a better soil water condition (reserved more soil water for crop growth) than SC and CT during the wheat and maize growth season. However, both the average ET of winter wheat and spring maize under all of the treatments had no significant differences (P > 0.05) in ten years. In ten years, NS and CN rotations had higher water use efficiency (WUEs) than the SC rotation and CT, BNS had the highest WUE (19.0 kg ha(-1) mm(-1))for the spring maize - winter wheat rotation. Tillage rotation and fertilization had an interactive effect on soil water use and crop growth, and the results might clarify the response of crop yield and soil water variation to fertilization and tillage rotations. For further and sustainable development of crop production, BNS (5133 and 8415 kg ha(-1) for wheat and maize yield, respectively; soil water in fallow: 386 mm) and BCN (5221 and 8116 kg ha(-1) for wheat and maize yield, respectively; soil water in fallow: 388 mm) are recommended as the optimal fertilization and tillage rotations for rainfed crop production on the Loess Plateau.					wang, xiao/HZI-9156-2023; hao, wang/IXN-0703-2023; Li, June/JEF-1173-2023; wang, yu/IUQ-6654-2023	hao, wang/0000-0002-5109-7194; 													0378-3774	1873-2283				JUL 20	2019	221						362	370		10.1016/j.agwat.2019.04.018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.04.018													WOS:000472698600035

A methodology was developed to identify soil salinity in Sudan by utilizing optical and radar-based satellite data as well as variables obtained from digital elevation models that are known to indicate variations in soil salinity. The methodology includes the transfer of models to areas where similar conditions prevail. A geographically coordinated database was established, incorporating a variety of environmental variables based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Electrical Conductivity (EC) measurements from the saturation extract of soil samples collected at three different depths (0-30, 30-60, and 60-90 cm). Thereafter, Multinomial Logistic Regression (MNLR) and Gradient Boosting Algorithm (GBM), were utilized to spatially classify the salinity levels in the region. To determine the applicability of the model trained at the reference site to the target area, a Multivariate Environmental Similarity Surface (MESS) analysis was conducted. The producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, and Tau index parameters were used to evaluate the model's accuracy, and spatial confusion indices were computed to assess uncertainty. At different soil depths, Tau index values for the reference area ranged from 0.38 to 0.77, whereas values for target area samples ranged from 0.66 to 0.88, decreasing as the depth increased. Clay normalized ratio (CLNR), Salinity Index 1, and SAR data were important variables in the modeling. It was found that the subsoils in the middle and northwest regions of both the reference and target areas had a higher salinity level compared to the topsoil. This study highlighted the effectiveness of model transfer as a means of identifying and evaluating the management of regions facing significant salinity-related challenges. This approach can be instrumental in identifying alternative areas suitable for agricultural activities at a regional level.

J	Tang, K; Hailu, A				Tang, Kai; Hailu, Atakelty			Smallholder farms' adaptation to the impacts of climate change: Evidence from China's Loess Plateau	LAND USE POLICY												The impacts of climate change on agriculture in developing countries will depend on the extent to which agricultural production in those regions adapts to climate change's influences. This study uses a whole-farm land use optimisation approach to explore climate change impacts, when including adaptation, on farm profitability, production and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the Loess Plateau of northern China. The results show that with adaptation activities, the losses in smallholder farm profitability caused by the climate change could be moderate. Declining rainfall results in land use changes that generate higher on-farm GHG emissions with the most economically beneficial adaptations. With 5 % or 10 % decline in annual rainfall, the introduction of agricultural carbon tax would generate substantial reduction in on-farm GHG emissions. With 30 % rainfall reduction, agricultural carbon tax is not likely to bring about considerable emission reduction. The economically optimised land uses are generally sensitive to potential changes. When rainfall reductions appear, there is a clear trend toward reducing cropping area and transiting to pasture. With 5-10% rainfall reductions, increasing agricultural carbon tax with same rainfall reduction leads to the expansion in cropping enterprises. However, with 30 % rainfall reduction, land allocations are not sensitive to agricultural carbon tax. When with declining annual rainfall, in the optimal enterprises more oats-pasture rotations are employed to reduce wheat dominated rotations. Besides land use patterns, adaptations through altering farm management practices are also necessary. The economically optimised sheep flock would be increased considerably with declining rainfall. Overall, policymakers are suggested to initial more educational schemes to tell smallholder farmers how to make the best use of available adaptation strategies and consider changes in climate when design and implement agricultural policy.

Under those considerations, a regional discharge of 709 m(3)/s to the Pacific Ocean is estimated with a significant increasing trend of about 43 m(3)/s per decade over the 1970-2010 period. To represent the multidecadal behaviour of freshwater runoff along the region, a regional runoff analysis is proposed based on hydrological modelling at annual and monthly time step for unimpaired conditions over the whole 1970-2010 period. Differential Split-Sample Tests are used to assess the hydrological modelling robustness of the GR1A and GR2M conceptual lumped models, showing a satisfactory transposability from dry to wet years inside the thresholds defined for Nash-Sutcliffe and bias criteria. This allowed relating physical catchment characteristics with calibrated and validated model parameters, thus offering a regional perspective for dryland conditions in the study area (e.g., the anticlockwise hysteresis relationship found for seasonal precipitation-runoff relationship) as well as the impacts of climate variability and catchment characteristics.

Although elevated CO2 concentration (EC) has been reported to reduce Cd accumulation and toxicity in plants, evidence on the functions of elevated CO2 concentration and its mechanisms in the possible alleviation of Cd toxicity in soybean are limited. Here, we used physiological and biochemical methods together with tran-scriptomic comparison to explore the effects of EC on Cd-stressed soybean. Under Cd stress, EC significantly increased the weight of roots and leaves, promoted the accumulations of proline, soluble sugars, and flavonoid. In addition, the enhancement of GSH activity and GST gene expressions promoted Cd detoxification. These defensive mechanisms reduced the contents of Cd2+, MDA, and H2O2 in soybean leaves. The up-regulation of genes encoding phytochelatin synthase, MTPs, NRAMP, and vacuoles protein storage might play vital roles in the transportation and compartmentalization process of Cd. The MAPK and some transcription factors such as bHLH, AP2/ERF, and WRKY showed changed expressions and might be engaged in mediation of stress response. These findings provide a boarder view on the regulatory mechanism of EC on Cd stress and provide numerous potential target genes for future engineering of Cd-tolerant cultivars in soybean breeding programs under climate changes scenarios.																			0304-3894	1873-3336				APR 15	2023	448								130950	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.130950	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.130950		FEB 2023						36860078					WOS:000950613400001

Modelled outputs could be used to complement data from multi-environment trials. Field experiments were conducted in the rainy and dry seasons of 2015 and 2016 across four locations in maize growing regions of Northern Nigeria using 16 maize varieties planted under near-optimal conditions of moisture and soil nitrogen. The CERES-Maize model was calibrated using data from three locations and two seasons (rainy and dry) and evaluated using data from one location and two seasons all in 2015. Observed data from the four locations and two seasons in 2016 was used to create eight different environments. Two profile pits were dug in each location and were used separately in the simulations for each environment to provide replicated data for stability analysis in a combined ANOVA. The effects of the environment, genotype and GEI were highly significant (p = 0.001) for both observed and simulated grain yields. The environment explained 67 % and 64 % of the variations in observed and simulated grain yields respectively. The variance component of GEI (13 % for observed and 15 % for simulated) were lower but still considerable when compared to that of genotypes (19 % for observed and 21 % for simulated). From the stability analysis of the observed and simulated grain yields using six different stability models, three models (ASV, Ecovalence, and Sigma) ranked Ife Hybrid as the most stable variety. The slope of the regression (bi) model ranked Sammaz 11 as the most stable variety, while the Shukla model ranked Sammaz 28 as the most stable variety. Long-term seasonal analysis with the CERES-Maize model revealed that early and intermediate maturing varieties produce high yields in both wet and dry savannas, early and extra-early varieties produce high yields only in the dry savannas, while late maturing varieties produce high yields only in the wet savannas. When properly calibrated and evaluated, the CERES-Maize model can be used to generate data for GEI and stability studies of maize genotype in the absence of observed field data.

JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Notable dryland expansion from changes in global aridity has been documented in previous studies, particularly with the increase in global mean temperature. Here, we examined the changes in the aridity of the western region of Africa over the past four decades. Using the aridity index (P/PET) as an indicator, the Climate Research Unit (CRU TS) data was used to identify drying and wetting areas of the region. The result showed that intense warming of 0.018 degrees C per year has occurred which was more evident in the last two decades. The warming in the past two decades caused a significant increase in PET. The first two decades were the driest compared to the last decades, particularly the first decade which also had major drought occurrences across the region. The aridity index increased by 0.86 (x10-3) per year within the past four decades, with the greatest change at the semi-arid zone. Result showed that precipitation exerts dominant control on aridity changes in the region despite a sig-nificant increase in PET. This was evident in the expansion of the wet areas between 2000 and 2019 compared to the 1979-1998 period.

For farming communities that are dependent on ecological and environmental resources for their living, climate variability may significantly influence future farm viability. This study examined whether climatic conditions and water scarcity were associated with worsening farmer (dryland and irrigators) mental health in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), Australia. The sample consisted of 2141 observations (for 235 farmers) from a national longitudinal survey across fourteen waves (2001/02 to 2014/15) and was modelled using Correlative Random Effects panel data regression. This time-period included the Millennium Drought, allowing a natural experiment test of the impact of water scarcity on farmer mental health. Key findings were that farmers located in areas that had experienced reduced rainfall, water allocations < 30% and mean daily maximum summer temperatures over 32 degrees C had significantly worse mental health than farmers in other areas. In addition, farmers who had lower income during drought were much more likely to have worse mental health than in non-drought times.

Conservation agriculture practices have changed habitat use by rodent pests: implications for management of feral house mice	JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE												The advent of 'conservation agriculture' (CA) farming using zero- or no-tillage practices and an accompanying change in crop rotations in the last 10-15 years has potentially led to less disturbance of mouse burrows and increased cover and food supply. Given the irregular outbreaks of mice in grain cropping regions in Australia and the damage they cause, it is important to understand when and where mouse populations increase so that management strategies can be improved. We utilised a 20-year long-term mouse population data set collected prior to the introduction of CA farming practices and a more recent 8-year data set after CA to compare changes in mouse population abundance in a typical dryland grain cropping system in north-western Victoria, Australia. Mouse trapping data were used to compare abundance in crop and margin habitats during crop growth and non-crop (fallow) periods before ('conventional') and after introduction of CA. Mice are now resident year-round within crops and stubble and appear to only spill over into margin habitats. Previously developed recommendations for mouse management that include their control while in margin habitats may no longer be valid.

J	Ojima, DS				Ojima, Dennis S.			Climate resilient management in response to flash droughts in the US Northern Great Plains	CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY												The Northern Great Plains (NGP) region plays a very important role in providing water and land resources and other critical ecosystem services to support rural livelihoods. Semi-arid conditions and the tight coupling of livelihood enterprises with ecosystem services increases sensitivity to climate change. The changing climate and social-economic situations across the NGP have further challenged current management practices. Recent climate stresses has indicated that changing seasonality and extreme events (e.g., droughts, floods, ice storms) are impacting ecosystem services and increasing vulnerability to rural livelihoods. In particular, the emergence of rapid on-set of drought has been problematic to resource managers and operators due the shortened period to respond to these drought events. This paper provides a regional example for the North American Great Plains to illustrate how emerging climate impacts affect the ability to respond within the social-ecological system capabilities to manage for these impacts. This paper is a contribution to an international effort, the Global Dryland Ecosystem Programme (Fu et al. this issue), to develop regional research and engagement efforts to further understand the impacts of climate change on ecosystem processes and to enable this knowledge to guide further development of adaptive management options.

Based on principal component analysis and path analysis, we first generated a modified remote sensing ecological index (MRSEI) coupled with satellite and ground observational data during 2001-2020 that integrated four local indicators (greenness, wetness, and heatness that reflect vegetation status, water, and heat conditions, respectively, as well as soil erosion). Then, we assessed the ecological quality in Otindag Sandy Land during 2001-2020 based on the MRSEI at different time scales (i.e., the whole year, growing season, and non-growing season). MRSEI generally increased with an upward rate of 0.006/a during 2001-2020, with clear seasonal and spatial variations. Ecological quality was significantly improved in most regions of Otindag Sandy Land but degraded in the southern part. Regions with ecological degradation expanded to 18.64% of the total area in the non-growing season. The area with the worst grade of MRSEI shrunk by 15.83% of the total area from 2001 to 2020, while the area with the best grade of MRSEI increased by 9.77% of the total area. The temporal heterogeneity of ecological conditions indicated that the improvement process of ecological quality in the growing season may be interrupted or deteriorated in the following non-growing season. The implementation of ecological restoration measures in Otindag Sandy Land should not ignore the seasonal characteristics and spatial heterogeneity of local ecological quality. The results can explore the effectiveness of ecological restoration and provide scientific guides on sustainable development measures for drylands.																			1674-6767	2194-7783				AUG	2023	15	8					920	939		10.1007/s40333-023-0065-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-023-0065-9													WOS:001050712300003

Ecological restoration of ecosystem functioning in sandy land has become a worldwide urgent research issue. In this study, the effects of plant litter crust (plant litter from poplar leaves of the surrounding area and sand grains bonded together due to interaction of water erosion and wind erosion) on surface soil properties and the loamification process of sandy soil were assessed in a semi-arid sandy land ecosystem at the edge of Mu Us sandy land by the field experiment sampling and indoor analysis. Soil structure and nutrient content were measured at two depths (0-5 cm and 5-10 cm) of bare sandy soils (as control), the soils beneath of the biological soil crust and the three stages of plant litter crusts (1-, 3- and 5-years old). We found that plant litter crust cover significantly improved soil structure and soil moisture through increasing soil macro-aggregates, clay and silt sized grains content, and total soil porosity, and decreasing soil temperature. Significant differences were observed in the content of total nitrogen and available soil phosphorous and potassium among the different types of crust and bare sandy soil. In the 0-5 cm soil depth, the available phosphorous of 3- and 5-years litter curst were 71% and 94% higher than that of bare sandy soil, respectively. These results suggest that plant litter crust functioned as a driving force to promote the loamification process through modifying sandy soil surface properties. This study proves the critical role played by the plant litter crust in the ecological restoration of semi-arid sandy land ecosystem. Besides, the hypothesis that plant litter crusts have great potential in combating desertification is correct and should be considered as an appropriate measure for ecological restoration in sandy areas.

J	Tang, L; Li, SQ; Shen, YF				Tang, Liang; Li, Shiqing; Shen, Yufang			Response of maize yield and nitrogen leaching to combining controlled-release urea and normal urea under different surface mulching	JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE												BACKGROUND A one-off application of combining controlled-release urea (CRU) and conventional urea has been recommended for the reduction of nitrogen (N) loss and improvement of grain yield. However, the effects of combining CRU and urea with different surface mulching has not been studied in detail, and the underlying agronomical and physiological mechanisms need to be more clearly understood. RESULT A 3-year field study was conducted to determine the effects of combining CRU and urea with different surface mulching on dry matter, N accumulation and translocation, nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) residuals and loss in maize grown under rain-fed conditions. Three surface mulching [plastic film mulching (FM), straw mulching (SM) and no mulching (NM)] as well as three N fertilization [combining CRU and urea with 1:2 as the baseline application (NC), a split urea application with 4:3:3 (NU) and a N control (N0)] were used. The FM under NC fertilization increased N uptake, decreased NO3--N residual in the deep soil layer, and decreased N loss. The FM, SM and NM under NC fertilization increased 3-year mean grain yields by 5.8%, 4.0% and 4.6%, respectively, compared to that under NU fertilization. The FM under NC fertilization showed the highest grain yield and economic return. CONCLUSION Properly managing N application by mixing CRU and urea in a one-off application combined with plastic film mulching may have the potential to provide a better compromise among grain yield, N loss and economic returns for maize in rain-fed farmland.

Straw mulching for enhanced water use efficiency and economic returns from soybean fields in the Loess Plateau China	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Water shortages threaten agricultural sustainability in the semi-arid areas of the Loess Plateau. Judicious mulching management can improve water conservation practices to alleviate this issue while increasing crop productivity. We investigated the effect of straw strip mulching and film mulching on soil water consumption, temperature, growth, grain yield, and economic income of soybean [Glycine max(Linn.) Merr.] from 2017 to 2018 in Qingyang on the semi-arid Loess Plateau in China using four treatments: (a) alternating ridges and furrows with ridges mulched with white polyethylene film (PMP), (b) alternating flat and bare land with only the plat mulched by white polyethylene film (PMF), (c) alternating strips mulched with maize (Zea mays L.) straw (SM), and (d) traditional land planting without mulching (CK). The mulching treatments (PMP, PMF, and SM) increased soil water consumption and soil water use efficiency. The SM, PMF, and PMP treatments had 12.3-12.5, 16.8-22.1, and 23.2-24.2 mm higher soil water consumption (0-120 cm depth) than CK, most of which occurred in the 60-120 cm soil layer. Compared with CK, PMP and PMF significantly increased soil temperature by 1.30-1.31 degrees C and 0.76-1.00 degrees C, soybean grain yield by 38.6-39.0 % and 38.8-44.2 %, and water use efficiency (WUE) by 27.7-32.8 % and 30.8-37.5 %, respectively, while SM significantly decreased soil temperature by 0.96-1.15 degrees C, and increased grain yield by 21.8-25.4 % and WUE by 16.9-21.9 %. PMP and PMF did not significantly change soil water consumption, WUE, or grain yield. The SM treatment increased net income by 501.3-691.7 and 1914.5-2244.9 CNY ha(-1) relative to PMP and CK, respectively, but PMF and SM did not significantly differ. Therefore, the SM system could help increase grain yields and economic returns in dryland soybean production, avoiding the adverse effects of the increasingly popular plastic mulching approach.

J	Zhang, J; Hu, R; Ma, QR; Niu, MM				Zhang, Jie; Hu, Rui; Ma, Qianrong; Niu, Miaomiao			The Warming of the Arabian Sea Induced a Northward Summer Monsoon over the Tibetan Plateau	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Summer monsoon precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) has significant impacts on the ecology, economy, and Asian climate, but has exhibited anomalous spatial distribution since the early twenty-first century. To explore its distribution and attribution, this study investigated the northernmost boundary of the summer monsoon over the TP (TPSM) and the related precipitation. The TPSM and related precipitation extended poleward in the post-2000 period in response to the rising Arabian Sea surface temperature (ARB_SST) in the late spring and early summer. A warming Arabian Sea leads to the westward movement of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) circulation and moisture convergence with a higher moisture layer, which exerts a midlatitude wave train that exhibits a dipole mode (a west cyclone and an east anticyclone) over the TP. Consequently, the west trough and southerly are strengthened, which is conducive to transporting more poleward moisture mass from the moisture layer over the ISM zone through the midwestern TP. Furthermore, it contributes to the poleward TPSM and precipitation in the northern TP by coupling with the dipole mode. These findings help explain the wetting of the Asian dryland and its effects on the Northern Hemispheric climate.

(Amaranthaceae),A. mollisDesf. (Amaranthaceae),Cenchrus ciliarisL. (Poaceae) andLotus creticusL. (Fabaceae) are promising species for arid rangeland rehabilitation, because of their adaptation and palatability. Dry biomass,in vitrodigestibility, ash, nitrogen, neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre and lignin of 50% aboveground biomass (upper half of tufts assumed to be the firstly consumed parts by livestock) of these species were evaluated in the Sidi Makhlouf region of southern Tunisia, during December 2015, June 2016 and December 2016. Digestibility increased with nitrogen content and both of these variables are decreasing when the dry matter and fibre contents increased. Four groups of species were obtained, based on digestibility and nitrogen and lignin contents.A. halimusandL. creticusharvested in the winter of 2015 have superior forage quality.A. molliswas better able to regenerate after winter harvest. Forage quality ofC. ciliarisandL. creticusdecreased with seasonal variation. The rehabilitation of marginal saline dryland remains possible with local pastoral halophytes that produce good forage quality and may provide many economic and environmental benefits for local users.

Studying landscape patterns and ecosystem services (ES) at the village scale based on land use and land cover (LULC) is essential in addressing current ecosystem issues. Based on GF images, the paper selects village ecosystems of karst desertification control (KDC) as the research object. It uses the landscape pattern index, topographic position index (TPI), and value equivalent method to conduct a spatial and temporal analysis of the ecosystem service value (ESV) of the karst desertification control cycle (2015-2020). The results show that: 1) forest land, orchard land, and construction land increase, and dryland and grassland decrease. The landscape shows an aggregated state, with spreading and connectivity increasing while fragrant diversity is decreasing. 2) The total ecosystem service value increased by CNY 63.45 x 10(4), with regulating and cultural services on the rise and supply and support services on the decline. 3) With the rise of the TPI, the value of the supply services is inversely U-shaped, while the value of the remaining services increases. This study provides a case study about karst desertification areas for village-scale ecosystem services research.					zhou, jiayi/IQW-6977-2023															2296-665X				FEB 8	2023	11								1020331	10.3389/fenvs.2023.1020331	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1020331													WOS:000945156700001

Feijo; Linhares, Ana Paula			New paleoenvironmental and palynostratigraphic data from Solimoes Formation (Solimoes Basin, Amazonas, Brazil)	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES												The Western Amazon was affected by tectonic events of great impacts, such as the uplift of the Andes during the Neogene. Such events promoted significant changes in the fluvial drainage system, in the climate, as well as in the ecosystems, triggering great irradiation of the Amazonian biota. Marine evidence recorded in the region also influenced the radiation of the biota. Despite advances in the paleoenvironmental and age models proposed for the Western Amazon deposits, we still observe conflicting results and interpretations on these aspects. Thus, here were analyzed the palynological content of three cores aimed to contribute with new paleoenvironmental and biostratigraphic data of the Solimoes Formation. We presented new paleobotanical data from the 1AS-5-AM, 1AS-7D-AM, and 1AS-8-AM cores and correlated the biostratigraphic data already published with the data obtained here; were recognized five palynozones (Verrutricolporites, Psiladiporites, Crassoretitriletes, Grimsdalea, and Asteraceae), reaching a range from the early to the late Miocene. The vegetation throughout the sequences studied includes elements of dryland forest next to zones of wetlands vegetation, including flooded forests and swamps; the floristic composition changed over time, predominating flooding vegetation during the early and part of the middle Miocene.																			0895-9811	1873-0647				APR	2022	115								103751	10.1016/j.jsames.2022.103751	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsames.2022.103751		MAR 2022											WOS:000783082200001

Impact of yellow leaf virus on sugarcane commercial fields	TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY												A survey of Sugarcane yellow leaf virus (SCYLV) was conducted in northern Argentina in 2015 and 2016 using tissue blot immunoassay (TBIA). Results showed plant infection rates of 2.2-86.7% in sugarcane commercial fields from different growing areas. Percentage of infected leaves varied among cultivars and areas. NA 05-860 was the most infected cultivar (86.7% incidence). Virus genotypic diversity of SCYLV positive samples was analysed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The virus genotype BRA-PER was found in all samples, followed by genotypes REU and CUB (36% and 8% of positive samples, respectively). The following co-infection patterns were found: BRA-PER + REU (34%); BRA-PER + CUB (6%); and the three genotypes, BRA-PER + REU + CUB (2%). Sugar content loss in cultivar LCP 85-384 infected with SCYLV was evaluated. Sugar yield reduction in SCYLV positive plants was statistically significant in dryland conditions (p < 0.0001). Our results indicate the high prevalence of SCYLV, the first detection of genotypes CUB and REU, and reduction in sucrose content related to SCYLV in Argentina. Disease management in the crop region should include the use of healthy planting material and SCYLV-tolerant cultivars.

Determining large-scale patterns of plant elemental concentrations and stoichiometry along environmental gradients is critical for understanding plant adaptive strategies and predicting ecosystem biogeochemistry processes. However, it remains unclear as to how plant carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations and their stoichiometry in different organs (leaves, stems and roots) respond to large-scale environmental gradients in drylands. 2. We determined C, N and P concentrations and their ratios in leaves, stems and roots of plants growing in the dryland ecosystems of China. Using threshold indicator taxa analyses, we identified indicator species of plant C, N and P responses to aridity and soil properties. 3. The arithmetic averaged concentrations of C, N and P in drylands were 414, 18.7 and 1.38 mg/g for leaves respectively; 445, 12.1 and 1.08 mg/g for stems respectively; and 418, 10.5 and 0.89 mg/g for roots respectively. The C:N, C:P and N:P ratios were 25.2, 386 and 16.3 for leaves respectively; 42.8, 592 and 14.8 for stems respectively; and 46.8, 658 and 15.6 for roots respectively. Aridity and soil pH generally exerted positive effects on plant N and negative effects on C and P concentrations and, thus, were related negatively to C:N ratios and positively to C:P and N:P ratios. The C, N and P concentrations in organs generally increased with increasing corresponding soil C, N and P concentrations. Shrubs were mainly positive indicators of plant C, N and P concentrations in response to aridity and soil pH, and negative indicators of soil nutrients. In contrast, herbaceous species were mainly positive indicators of soil nutrients and negative indicators of aridity and soil pH. 4. These findings indicate that plants tend to accumulate N rather than C and P with increasing aridity and soil pH. The identification of indicator species for plant elements in response to aridity and soil traits informs our understanding of species-specific biogeographic patterns of organ elements and potential adaptive strategies of plants in drylands.

Cd stress negatively affects plant growth and development by triggering oxidative stress. Limited information is available on the role of iron (Fe) in ameliorating Cd stress tolerance in legumes. This study assessed the effect of Cd stress in two lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) varieties differing in seed Fe concentration (L4717 (Fe-biofortified) and JL3) under controlled conditions. Six biochemical traits, five growth parameters, and Cd uptake were recorded at the seedling stage (21 days after sowing) in the studied genotypes grown under controlled conditions at two levels (100 mu M and 200 mu M) of cadmium chloride (CdCl2). The studied traits revealed significant genotype, treatment, and genotype x treatment interactions. Cd-induced oxidative damage led to the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde in both genotypes. JL3 accumulated 77.1% more H2O2 and 75% more lipid peroxidation products than L4717 at the high Cd level. Antioxidant enzyme activities increased in response to Cd stress, with significant genotype, treatment, and genotype x treatment interactions (p < 0.01). L4717 had remarkably higher catalase (40.5%), peroxidase (43.9%), superoxide dismutase (31.7%), and glutathione reductase (47.3%) activities than JL3 under high Cd conditions. In addition, L4717 sustained better growth in terms of fresh weight and dry weight than JL3 under stress. JL3 exhibited high Cd uptake (14.87 mg g(-1) fresh weight) compared to L4717 (7.32 mg g(-1) fresh weight). The study concluded that the Fe-biofortified lentil genotype L4717 exhibited Cd tolerance by inciting an efficient antioxidative response to Cd toxicity. Further studies are required to elucidate the possibility of seed Fe content as a surrogacy trait for Cd tolerance.

In Chad, it is used for many purposes, but very little is known about the technological properties of its wood, which sometimes leads to inappropriate uses. This work consisted to study the physical and mechanical properties of this wood, collected in the Sahelian and Sudanian chadian zone. As well as the impact study of the sampling areas of these properties. The result obtained shows that, the density, infradensity; modulus of elasticity, compression strength were significantly higher in the Sahelian zone than in the Sudanian zone, i.e. 508 and 409 kg.m(-3); 5555 and 23.7 MPa, compared to 444 and 359 kg.m(-3); 4150 and 19.6 MPa. The total tangential shrinkage, total volumetric shrinkage, fibre saturation point; static bending strength were significantly lower in wood from the Sahelian zone compared to the Sudanian zone, i.e. 4.6%, 7.7%, 23.7%; 42.5 MPa, compared to 6.6%, 9.5%, 28.9%; 52.6 MPa.

It is an important source of dietary protein to millions of people living in low-income countries in South-east Asia and Africa. The present study emphasises the development of genomic resources and their application in marker-trait association for plant phenology and yield-related traits in lathyrus.In silicomining of nucleotide sequences identified 203 simple sequence repeat (SSR) motifs, of which trimer repeats (62%) were most abundant followed by tetramer (19%), hexamer (10%), pentamer (6%) and dimer (3%) nucleotide repeats. Of 150 SSR markers screened, 60 markers were amplified 75 alleles from 50 germplasm lines with 2-3 alleles per locus and the polymorphic information content of 0.45 was observed. We report 6 significant marker-trait associations using the developed SSR markers for plant phenology and yield-related traits following mixed linear model (Q+K) analysis. Gene ontology search of trait linked markers revealed marker regions encoding genes related to homeobox-leucine zipper protein ATHB-6-like, rubredoxin family protein, and cationic peroxidise. Understanding the association of novel alleles in trait expression will play a significant role in future lathyrus crop improvement programmes.

Biocrusts are associated with increased plant biomass and nutrition at seedling stage independently of root-associated fungal colonization	PLANT AND SOIL												Aims Plant-soil interactions are important drivers of plant productivity and community structure. Biocrusts - soil surface-dwelling biotic communities comprised of cyanobacteria, fungi, bryophytes, and/or lichens - are widespread in drylands globally. Biocrusts are described as "mantles of fertility" and have been shown to have facilitative, but species-specific effects on plant productivity. Yet, patterns and mechanisms underlying biocrust facilitation of plant productivity remain unclear. Methods Using mesocosms with bare soil versus biocrust cover we investigated the effects of biocrusts on plant biomass allocation, leaf chemistry and colonization by root-associated fungi. Results Plant responses to biocrust presence were species-specific. Overall, biocrusts were associated with increased plant biomass and/or leaf N concentrations in Elymus elymoides, Bouteloua gracilis and Zea mays. However, plants grown in biocrusts had lower root-associated fungal colonization compared to bare soils. Conclusions Biocrusts were associated with increased plant biomass and leaf N. Yet, plant growth responses to biocrusts were not correlated with differences in root-associated fungal colonization between soil mesocosm types. Understanding species-specificity in biocrust facilitation of plant growth may have important implications for understanding plant community structure in dryland ecosystems.

Novel wheat varieties facilitate deep sowing to beat the heat of changing climates	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE												Wheat yields are threatened by global warming and unreliable rainfall, which increase heat and drought stress. A potential adaptation strategy is to sow earlier and deeper, taking advantage of stored soil water. However, the short coleoptiles of modern semi-dwarf wheat varieties reduce emergence when sown deep. Novel genotypes with alternative dwarfing genes have longer coleoptiles to facilitate deep sowing, but the yield benefit has been uncertain. We validated new crop simulation routines with field data to assess the impact of novel genotypes on Australian wheat production. We predict that these genotypes, coupled with deep sowing, can increase national wheat yields by 18-20% under historical climate (1901-2020), without increased yield variability, with benefits also projected under future warming. These benefits are likely to extend to other dryland wheat production regions globally. Our results highlight the impact of synergy between new genetics and management systems to adapt food production to future climates. Wheat genotypes with improved seedling emergence can be sown deeper, facilitating seedling survival under climate change. Crop modelling of these novel genotypes predicts yield increases of up to 20% relative to current genotypes in Australia, with potential for substantial gains in other regions globally.

Crop edges host higher abundances of arable weed species, therefore they may act as a refuge for the conservation of these rare arable species. Using mesocosms, we experimentally tested how conditions at field edges (i.e. lower sowing densities and less intensive fertiliser applications) operate on the growth (biomass and height) and reproduction (reproductive biomass and flower onset) of six rare arable species. We found the rare arable species achieved lower biomass when growing with wheat compared with growing alone, and biomass of most of species was lower under high wheat sowing density than under low sowing density. In contrast, fertiliser application affected only two of the six arable species tested, especially when they were growing alone. Although the time to flowering was not affected by the conditions tested, reproductive biomass showed the same trends as overall biomass. These results indicate that conservation of rare arable species must primarily consider reductions in crop competition to increase their biomass and reproductive ability.

Co-operating photovoltaic plants with biocrust nurseries has potential to restore soil health alongside renewable energy production. Large portions of global arid lands are under severe, increasing anthropogenic stress, their soils progressively degrading or already degraded. The interventional regeneration of the natural cover of these soils-photosynthetic communities known as biocrusts that armour them against erosion and fertilize them-is currently regarded as promising for dryland restoration and sustainability. Technologies for biocrust restoration developed during the past decades are, however, invariably of high effort and low capacity, constraining application to small spatial scales. We tested the notion that crustivoltaics, where solar power plants are used as ad hoc biocrusts nurseries, can break this scaling barrier. We show experimentally that solar plants indeed promote the formation of biocrust over neighbouring soils, doubling biocrust biomass and tripling biocrust cover, and that after biocrust harvesting, recovery is swift particularly if re-inoculated. Our results point to a mode of continuous dual operation that is not only effective and socioeconomically attractive but can also increase capacity by orders of magnitude to reach regional scales.

J	He, D; Oliver, Y; Wang, EL				He, Di; Oliver, Yvette; Wang, Enli			Predicting plant available water holding capacity of soils from crop yield	PLANT AND SOIL												Aims Quantification of variations in plant available water holding capacity (PAWC) of soils helps to improve yield forecast and inform spatially variable management practices in dryland agriculture systems. We developed and tested a general inverse approach to estimate PAWC from crop yield. Methods The APSIM model was used to simulate wheat yield on synthetic soils with contrasting PAWC and climates. The simulated results were used to develop an empirical model to relate simulated yield to PAWC. The empirical model was inversely used to predict PAWC from observed crop yield. Potential prediction ability was quantified using independently simulated wheat yield on actual soils. The actual ability was assessed with measured wheat yields and PAWC. Results The approach had higher accuracy for sites with high rainfall or dominant summer rainfall. It could potentially provide acceptable PAWC predictions across contrasting climate regions (prediction error < 37 mm, 33.5%). The prediction error using crop yield against measured PAWC was <25 mm (26.5%). Conclusions Our results demonstrate that soil PAWC can be reliably predicted from crop yield. This approach provides an alternative way to predict PAWC rather than directly measuring it via soil sampling, with profound implications for reducing labour and costs.

Plant RUEs have been widely used as indicators to understand plant acclimation processes to unfavorable environmental conditions. This study aimed to examine seasonal dynamics in RUEs in two widely distributed plant species in a typical desert shrub community (i.e., Artemisia ordosica and Leymus secalinus) based on in-situ measurements of leaf photosynthesis, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen concentration (i.e., N-mass + N-area), and several site-related abiotic factors. Both species exhibited significant seasonal variation in RUEs, with a coefficient of variation (CV) > 30% and seasonal divergence among the various RUEs. Seasonal divergence was largely controlled by variation in stomatal conductance (Gs), which was in turn influenced by variation in soil water content (SWC) and water vapor pressure deficit (VPD). RUEs between species converged, being positively correlated, yielding: (i) r(2) = 0.40 and p < 0.01 for WUE; (ii) r(2) = 0.18 and p < 0.01 for LUE; and (iii) r(2) = 0.25 and p < 0.01 for NUE. RUEs for A. ordosica were mostly larger than those for L. secalinus, but less reactive to drought. This suggests A. ordosica was more conservative in its usage of available resources and was, therefore, better able to adapt to arid conditions. Resource use strategies between species differed in response to drought. Desert shrubs are projected to eventually replace grasses, as drought severity and duration increase with sustained regional climate change.

This study used the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model coupled with the glacier module to simulate the hydrological processes in the upper reaches of the Weigan River estuary from 1965 to 1991, to restore and quantitatively evaluate the conditions of the estuarine runoff in the no-reservoir scenario, and to analyse the impact of the construction of water conservation projects on the estuarine runoff based on this model. The results show that the SWAT model has good applicability in the study area, with 41.45% and 58.55% of the increase in runoff due to increased precipitation and temperature, respectively, over the 52 years study period. The degree of influence of the construction of water conservation projects on runoff from the mountain in different seasons was spring > autumn > winter > summer, with 83.28% of the spring runoff being influenced by artificial regulation. The construction of water conservation projects has alleviated water shortage problems to a certain extent, and is an effective measure for achieving the efficient allocation of water resources in arid areas.

This study aimed to determine the combining ability effects of selected bread wheat genotypes (Triticum aestivum L.) for yield and yield-related traits. Eight parental lines were selected and crossed using a half-diallel mating design. The parents and 28 crosses were evaluated at two sites in Ethiopia, representing drought-stressed and non-stressed conditions, using a 6 x 6 simple lattice design. The parental line ETW17302 was the best general combiner for the growth indices: days to heading, days to maturity, grain-filling period, and 1 000-kernel weight, thereby enabling direct selection for improved grain yield under a drought-stressed condition. Parent ETW17377 could also be used for improving grain yield under a drought-stress condition owing to its positive and significant general combining ability effect on grain yield. The families ETW17302 x ETW17377, ETW17396 x ETW17374, and ETW17396 x ETW17385 were the best specific combiners for improving grain yield under the drought-stressed condition. The selected parents and families are desirable genetic resources to enhance yield and yield-related traits under both drought-stressed and non-stressed conditions.

The mutant also displays rapid recovery from water stress conditions. Under water stress conditions mutant plants reached maturity faster and produced more seeds than its wild type wheat progenitor. Wild-type Tugela DN plants died within 7 days after induction of water stress induced at late booting stage, while mutant plants survived by maintaining a higher relative moisture content (RMC), increased total chlorophyll, and a higher photosynthesis rate and stomatal conductance. Analysis of the proteome of mutant plants revealed that they better regulate post-translational modification (SUMOylation) and have increased expression of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) proteins. Mutant plants also expressed unique proteins associated with dehydration tolerance including abscisic stress-ripening protein, cold induced protein, cold-responsive protein, dehydrin, Group 3 late embryogenesis, and a lipoprotein (LAlv9) belonging to the family of lipocalins. Overall, our results suggest that our new mutant RYNO3936 has a potential for inclusion in future breeding programs to improve drought tolerance under dryland conditions.

Disentangling the effects of two co-occurring biotic modifiers on vegetation properties in a semi-arid savannah ecosystem	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Biotic modifiers are species that strongly alter environmental conditions, and that often shape local communities. When more than one biotic modifier co-occurs, the potential for interactive effects exists, where the effects of one species may negate or enhance the impacts of a second biotic modifier. Here we test for an interactive effect of aardvark (Orycteropus afer) burrows and tree presence on soil (soil temperature, moisture and compaction) and understorey vegetation properties (plant cover, species richness and composition) in a semi-arid savannah. Aardvark burrowing altered abiotic conditions, with soil temperature and compaction being lower, and soil moisture higher, in burrow entrances than at the burrow mounds and control microsites. In addition, the impact of aardvark burrowing on soil moisture and soil compaction was mediated by the occurrence of trees. In contrast, vegetation cover and species richness were independently affected by burrowing and trees, while vegetation composition was only affected by the occurrence of trees, but not by burrowing. This research suggests that co-occurring biotic modifiers can have both independent and interactive effects, and disentangling their impacts will help understand the mechanisms underlying dryland plant communities.

Ooids exhibit up to 60 tangential aragonitic lami-nae that were formed around fluvial sediment grains during the late Holocene. Covering an area >1250 km2, their spatial extent rivals in size individual ooid shoals from the Bahamas. Shoals appear to be spatially linked with the De Grey River, suggesting that fluvial outputs, combined with a macrotidal range, facilitated the precipitation of the ooids. Following their formation, ooids were reworked through tidal and wave processes along the delta. As a re-sult, the delta sedimentary features, including beach ridges, mouth bars, and distributary channels, are composed of ooids. This discovery broadens the range of depositional and climatic environments in which ooids can form and demonstrates that fluvial runoff may not inhibit aragonite precipitation. Such a configuration also provides a unique analogue for ancient ooids found in association with siliciclastic grains and further indicates that the interpretation of typical siliciclastic geomorphologies from geophysical data does not preclude the presence of carbonate grains.

We examined the effects of soil water content on the responses of agronomic and root morphological and physiological traits of maize (Zea mays L. cv. NE15) to P supply. Seven P supply levels (0, 12.5, 25, 50, 75, 100, and 300 mg P kg(-1) soil) and two water regimes (well watered, WW; water stress, WS) were employed. Shoot dry weight, root dry weight, and root length were enhanced with the increase of P supply rates, while the root : shoot ratio, specific root length, and transcription levels of four inorganic phosphate (P-i) transporter genes (Pht1;1-4) declined with the increase of P supply rates. Under WS conditions, root dry weight and root length decreased by 4-38% and 6-32%, respectively, compared to the WW treatment, whereas the root : shoot ratio and specific root length increased by 7-33% and 8-28%, respectively. P-i transporter gene transcription was up-regulated and that of the arbuscular-mycorrhizal-induced transporter (Pht1;6) gene was both up- and down-regulated in response to the WS treatment. Comprehensive analysis revealed that interaction between maize root morphological and physiological traits was stimulated as a strategy for efficient P acquisition under WS conditions. This study is the first to use both morphological and physiological traits to describe the impacts of soil water conditions on maize responses to P fertilization. Our results provide valuable information for optimization of P management under different soil water conditions.

Due to the low recycling rate, long durability, and small size, microplastics pose a potential risk to soil fauna, which are critical for maintaining healthy soil. However, whether and how would microplastics affect soil biodiversity and ecological functioning is not well-understood. Soil nematodes are valuable indicators of the soil food web. In the present study, the abundance, diversity, community composition, maturity indices, soil food web indices, and metabolic footprints of soil nematodes in bulk soils of maize were utilized to indicate the potential impacts of polypropylene (PP) microplastic pollution on soil fauna using a soil-incubation experiment in a climate-controlled chamber with four concentration levels of microplastic pellets (0%, 0.5%, 1%, and 2%, w/w) added to loess soil collected from the Loess Plateau in China. Soil sampling was conducted at the fully ripe stage of maize. Twenty-nine genera of nematodes, including thirteen genera of plant-feeding nematodes, seven genera of bacterial-feeding nematodes, five genera of fungal-feeding nematodes, and four genera of omnivorous nematodes were recovered from soil samples. Microplastic concentration negatively affected the abundance, diversity (including genus richness, Margalef's richness, Shannon-Wiener index, and Simpson's dominance index), sigma maturity index ( n-ary sumation MI), structural index, and metabolic footprints. The abundances of plant parasites, bacterivores, fungivores, and omnivores in 2% soils were reduced by 90.16%, 76.06%, 82.35%, and 100%, respectively, in comparison with those of control. The major drivers of soil nematode communities in bulk soils of maize at a depth range of 0-20 cm were the soil pH, soil organic carbon content, C/N, and TP content. In conclusion, the addition of 200 mu m-sized PP microplastic pellets negatively affected the soil nematode community and associated ecological functioning under greenhouse conditions.																				2296-665X				JUN 14	2022	10								872898	10.3389/fenvs.2022.872898	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.872898													WOS:000817148800001

Biocrusts play a prominent role as pioneers in dryland soils. However, the seasonal dynamics of biocrusts remain poorly resolved. In this study, we collected biocrusts across a successional gradient (cyanobacteria, cyanolichen, chlorolichen, and moss-dominated) from southeastern Tengger Desert (China) during the summer and autumn seasons, and explored seasonal changes in metabolism and biomass using multi-omics approaches. We found that Cyanobacteria and Asco-mycota were the dominant active taxa and both exhibited higher abundances in autumn. We also found that the dom-inant primary producers in biocrusts strongly affected community-wide characteristics of metabolism. Along with seasonal differences in light energy utilization, utilization of inorganic energy sources exhibited higher expression in the summer while for organic sources, in the autumn. We found that overall metabolism was significantly regulated by the ratio of intracellular to extracellular polymer degradation, and affected by NO3-, PO43- and EC (in the sum-mer)/NO2- (in the autumn). In summary, biocrust growth varied with seasonal variation in light energy utilization and complementary chemical energy sources, with the most suitable season varying with biocrust successional type.

Sustainable management practices for durum wheat production: Analyzing specific agronomic interventions on productivity, grain micronutrient content, and quality	HELIYON												As compared with single agronomic crop management practices during grain formation, knowledge about integrated agronomic management practices on grain mineral composition and grain technological properties in durum wheat is limited. This knowledge is important for determining management strategies aimed at increasing grain yield without affecting grain nutritional quality. Integrated agronomic practices such as foliar nutrient application x seeding rate x varieties combined with growing locations were investigated to evaluate the dynamics of yield and grain quality traits. Two durum wheat varieties, three-level of micronutrients (i.e. control, FeSO4, and ZnSO4), and four levels of seeding rate (i.e. 100, 125, 150, and 175 kg ha-1) were arranged in split-split plot design under two different growing locations (environments). The main plots were assigned to the varieties, subplots to micronutrients, and sub-sub plots to the seeding rate treatments. Zinc and iron were applied in a form of ZnSO4 and FeSO4 at the early flowering stage, both at a rate of 25 kg ha-1. Results showed a linear increment in biomass (21.5%) and grain yield (23.5%) under a high seeding rate, even though the 1000-grain weight, the number of grains spike-1, spike length, and the number of grains spike-1 were decreased. Higher varietal and environmental response of seeding rate was observed between varieties. The grain protein content, gluten, and zeleyn index decreased as the seeding rate increased. Grain micronutrient content was significantly influenced by seeding rate and varietal difference. The grain protein content was higher in a dryland environment than in a wet environment. A combined use of density-tolerant varieties, high seeding rate, and foliar-based iron application can improve the grain yield from 2.01 to 3.20 t ha-1 under a potential environment. Hence, all stakeholders should consider the genotype (G), environment (E), management (M), and their synergies, as far as grain yield and quality are considered simultaneously.

In this study, we screened 6665 host-seeking, gravid and blood-fed mosquitoes for infection with flaviviruses and assessed the vertebrate hosts of the blood-fed mosquitoes sampled in Baringo and Kajiado counties; both dryland ecosystem counties in the Kenyan Rift Valley. Sequence fragments of two ISFs were detected. Cuacua virus (CuCuV) was found in three blood-fed Mansonia (Ma.) africana. The genome was sequenced by next-generation sequencing (NGS), confirming 95.8% nucleotide sequence identity to CuCuV detected in Mansonia sp. in Mozambique. Sequence fragments of a potential novel ISF showing nucleotide identity of 72% to Aedes flavivirus virus were detected in individual blood-fed Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae s.l., Ma. africana and Culex (Cx.) univittatus, all having fed on human blood. Blood-meal analysis revealed that the collected mosquitoes fed on diverse hosts, primarily humans and livestock, with a minor representation of wild mammals, amphibians and birds.

A new perspective and approach to ecosystem restoration: a seed enhancement technology guide and case study	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Restoration efforts in dryland systems are often limited by a complex range of environmental variables and chronically low establishment of seeded native species. Methods for restoring large tracts of degraded drylands in the western United States and southwestern Australia have not advanced substantially since the early 1900s despite continuous efforts to improve success. Historic agricultural practices used in large-scale restoration efforts are often unsuccessful. A multidisciplinary approach toward problem resolution is necessary for future advancements in restoration applications and methods. Specifically, agricultural technologies such as seed enhancements should be applied to native restoration approaches. Seed enhancement technologies, such as activated carbon coating and extruded pelleting, are novel in the restoration context. However, their use is increasingly recognized as an opportunity to overcome current limitations to restoration efforts. At this early juncture in the development of seed enhancement technologies within restoration, we reflect on the need to tailor current agricultural technologies in light of the differences between agricultural and restoration contexts and reconceptualize our approach to seed enhancement technologies. In this paper, we provide a guide for the development of seed enhancement technologies in ecological restoration.

In this research, we studied the botanical composition of the diet of horses, guanacos, and European brown hares, in summer grasslands of the high mountain range of the Region of Coquimbo, Chile. We were able to determine the main species that these herbivores consume, as well as the characteristics of their diets in terms of diversity and quantify the potential trophic competition between them. The main grassland's species play a maintenance and subsistence role for the three species of herbivores studied, for which they establish selective strategies on certain species of plants, in order to improve the quality of their diets. For an adequate management of natural grasslands, the knowledge and understanding of the dietary habits of herbivores and their trophic interactions are fundamental. During two summer seasons, in a mountain range of a sector of the Coquimbo Region, Chile, the botanical composition, diversity, and similarity of the diets of horses, European brown hares, and guanacos were studied, as was the selectivity of the main grassland plant species, using feces microhistology. The contribution of hydromorphic grasses was similar in the diets of guanacos (35.90 +/- 7.27%) and horses (32.25 +/- 4.50%), differing from that found in hares (16.32 +/- 5.32%). Dryland grassland grasses contributed similarly to the diets of horses (13.21 +/- 3.22%), guanacos (22.53 +/- 5.21%) and hares (18.35 +/- 3.81%), as well as graminoids, which averaged 47.79 +/- 6.66%, 35.63 +/- 10.76% and 38.94 +/- 7.88%, in diets of horses, guanacos, and hares, respectively, without significant differences. The contribution of herbaceous dicotyledons was only important in hares (23.76 +/- 3.76%), while that of shrubs was low (<3%) and similar among the three herbivores. Dietary diversity was similar among the three herbivore species (73-79%), with a higher degree of dietary overlap between horses and guanacos (55.7%), which was higher than that obtained between hares and guanacos (50%) and between horses and hares (48%), for which there would be a potential trophic competition between them. The most abundant species of dryland and wet grasslands generally fulfill a functional role of subsistence and a nutritional role of maintenance; however, for the three herbivores studied, a different selective behavior was evidenced, according to their physiological differences, with the selection process little affected by the relative abundance of these species in the grasslands. Due to the above, herbivores resort to the selection of certain species that, despite being not very abundant in grasslands, play an important nutritional and functional role, improving the quality of their diets.																			2076-2615					MAY	2021	11	5							1313	10.3390/ani11051313	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani11051313								34063638					WOS:000653381200001
J	Li, XD; Shao, MA; Zhao, CL				Li, Xiangdong; Shao, Ming'an; Zhao, Chunlei			Estimating the field capacity and permanent wilting point at the regional scale for the Hexi Corridor in China using a state-space modeling approach	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												Purpose The field capacity (FC) and permanent wilting point (PWP) are important soil hydraulic properties that determine the maximum available water for plants, and they are crucial parameters for biophysical models and irrigation management. However, previous estimates of the FC and PWP failed to consider their spatial correlations at the regional scale. Therefore, we estimated the FC and PWP using the state-space equation by considering the spatial correlations between soil properties. Materials and methods We estimated the FC and PWP using a first order autoregressive state-space equation based on the elevation (Elev), bulk density (BD), soil texture (Clay, Silt, Sand), soil organic carbon (SOC), and land use (LU) with a data set obtained from 104 in situ sampling sites across the entire Hexi Corridor. Results and discussion The results indicated that the distributions of the FC and PWP exhibited moderate variations in the Hexi Corridor, with values of 0.127 +/- 0.060 and 0.075 +/- 0.034 g/g (mean +/- 1 standard deviation (SD)), respectively. According to t tests, the autocorrelation coefficients for FC, PWP, Elev, LU, Silt, Sand, and SOC as well as the cross-correlation coefficients between FC, PWP, and pertinent variables were significant with one lag distance (approximately 40 km) (p < 0.05). Calculations of the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) showed that the state-space models performed better at estimating FC and PWP than multiple linear stepwise regression models (SMLRs). Bivariate state-space equations based on Silt and LU were the optimal models for estimating FC (R-2 = 0.999, RMSE = 0.002 g/g) and PWP (R-2 = 0.997, RMSE = 0.002 g/g). According to the coefficients in the optimal state-space models, soil texture and LU were the dominant factors that affected the spatial variability in FC and PWP. After neglecting the spatial correlations between variables, the SMLRs showed that BD and soil texture were the best variables for estimating FC and PWP. Conclusions The state-space approach is recommended as a useful tool for quantifying larger-scale spatial patterns in soil properties.																			1439-0108	1614-7480				NOV	2019	19	11					3805	3816		10.1007/s11368-019-02314-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-019-02314-6													WOS:000491550500014

Analysis of Rock Varnish from the Mojave Desert by Handheld Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy	MOLECULES												Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a form of optical emission spectroscopy that can be used for the rapid analysis of geological materials in the field under ambient environmental conditions. We describe here the innovative use of handheld LIBS for the in situ analysis of rock varnish. This thinly laminated and compositionally complex veneer forms slowly over time on rock surfaces in dryland regions and is particularly abundant across the Mojave Desert climatic region of east-central California (USA). Following the depth profiling examination of a varnished clast from colluvial gravel in Death Valley in the laboratory, our in situ analysis of rock varnish and visually similar coatings on rock surfaces was undertaken in the Owens and Deep Spring valleys in two contexts, element detection/identification and microchemical mapping. Emission peaks were recognized in the LIBS spectra for the nine elements most abundant in rock varnish-Mn, Fe, Si, Al, Na, Mg, K, Ca and Ba, as well as for H, Li, C, O, Ti, V, Sr and Rb. Focused follow-up laboratory and field studies will help understand rock varnish formation and its utility for weathering and chronological studies.

While low water potentials induced by open stomata may initially be associated with greater CO2 supply and a higher water flux from the rhizosphere to the canopy, they also inhibit cell growth, photosynthesis and ultimately water supply. Here, we show that plants regulate their leaf water potential in an optimal manner under given constraints using a simple leaf water status regulation model and data from a global dryland leaf water potential database. Model predictions agree strongly with observations across locations and species and are further supported by experimental data. Leaf water potentials non-linearly decline with soil water potential, underlining the shift from maximizing water supply to avoiding stress with declining water availability. Our results suggest that optimal regulation of the leaf water status under varying water supply and stress tolerance is a ubiquitous property of plants in drylands. The proposed model moreover provides a novel quantitative framework describing how plants respond to short- and long-term changes in water availability and may help elaborating models of plant and ecosystem functioning.

Potential Unintended Consequences of Livestock Drought Insurance	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS												Increasingly frequent and severe droughts pose one of the greatest challenges for dryland pastoralists in the Horn of Africa. Livestock drought insurance (LDI) has been proposed as a means to manage these risks. However, LDI may have unintended side effects, such as inducing unsustainable herd sizes leading to long-term pasture degradation. These issues are infeasible to study empirically given that none of the emerging LDI programs has existed at scale for any extended period of time. Thus, we study the potential long-term effects of LDI on pasture conditions at scale with the help of an agent-based model. We particularly consider the possibility that if insurance is taken up at scale, the quick herd size recovery that insurance enables after droughts can disrupt natural pasture recovery dynamics, with the potential to degrade the long-run carrying capacity of the vegetation. Our results show that, especially if pastures are very sensitive to grazing, insurance can indeed cause and/or intensify ecological instability. Furthermore, unfortunately, these unintended ecological consequences are most likely where insurance is needed the most. Designing the insurance product in the light of these insights may dampen these effects.

Costly signalling and the distribution of monumental mounds in Savai'i and 'Upolu, Samoa	ARCHAEOLOGY IN OCEANIA												Monumental architecture has long been a focus of archaeological research. The construction of large and elaborate structures is a costly endeavour, which may seem to have little immediate benefit. Costly signalling is one explanation which can be applied to this problem by determining the contexts in which monument construction would carry a selective advantage. This study investigates stone and earthen mounds and platforms from Savai'i and 'Upolu in Samoa. These are among the most common type of archaeological feature in the landscape, yet targeted research explaining why these costly mounds were built is lacking. One of the primary expectations of costly signalling is that monuments will be located near areas where contested resources are abundant. To test this expectation, a semi-automated feature identification method was used to identify mounds in LiDAR data, and a model of agricultural productivity was produced to map locations where the cultivation of dryland taro should have been successful. Mounds were found to be preferentially located near areas with high agricultural potential, suggesting that costly signalling could be an explanation for mound construction in Samoa, where mounds served to demonstrate resource holding potential and competitive ability.

Using L-band radar data for soil salinity mapping-a case study in Central Iraq	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS												Soil salinization is a critical environmental problem for dryland agriculture. Mapping its distribution and severity in space and time is essential for agricultural management and development. Recently, remote sensing technology has been widely applied in such mapping but mostly using optical remote sensing data. In conjunction with the field surveys, this case study was aimed at developing an operational approach for this purpose by employing ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) L-band radar data with support of Landsat 5 TM(Thematic Mapper) imagery acquired at almost the same time. The test was conducted in the Mussaib site in Central Iraq. The innovative procedure involved was the removal or minimization of the impact of vegetation cover and moisture on the backscattering coefficients by Water Cloud Model. The results revealed a strong correlation between the corrected backscattering coefficients of soil and the measured soil salinity (R-2 = 0.565-0.677). The radar-based salinity models developed through multivariate linear regression (MLR) analysis were able to predict salinity with reliability of 70.05%. In conclusion, it is possible to use radar data for soil salinity prediction and mapping in dry environment.					Wu, Weicheng/AAY-4918-2021; Al-Quraishi, Ayad M.

Dung beetles improve soil conditions but little is known about how their functioning changes with different land management intensities. We assessed the role of the telecoprid dung beetle Canthon humectus in soil nutrient mobilization and commercial crop growth in arid grasslands with contrasting cattle managements. We set up a mesocosm experiment where we monitored dung beetle activity in containers filled with dung and soil from sites with three different cattle managements. Dung removal rates due to beetle burial activity were 10% higher than due to dehydration alone but was not affected by cattle management. After 60 days of beetle activity nitrates and ammonium levels increased significantly as compared with control pots without beetles. Additionally, we monitored corn plant growth in pots with soil with and without beetle activity. Plants significantly increased their biomass due to beetle activity in the substrate with the highest and lowest pasture management intensity. In the latter case, more biomass was allocated to shoots. The ability of C. humectus to increase soil nutrients and enhance plant growth is affected by local cattle management.

They constitute primary staple crops in drylands, where their production is known to date back over 5000 years ago. Compared to other crops, millets and sorghum have received less attention until very recently, and their production has been progressively reduced in the last 50 years. Here, we present new models that focus on the ecological factors driving finger millet, pearl millet and sorghum traditional cultivation, with a global perspective. The interaction between environment and traditional agrosystems was investigated by Redundancy Analysis of published literature and tested against novel ethnographic data. Contrary to earlier beliefs, our models show that the total annual precipitation is not the most determinant factor in shaping millet and sorghum agriculture. Instead, our results point to the importance of other variables such as the duration of the plant growing cycle, soil water-holding capacity or soil nutrient availability. This highlights the potential of finger millet, pearl millet and sorghum traditional cultivation practices as a response to recent increase of aridity levels worldwide. Ultimately, these practices can play a pivotal role for resilience and sustainability of dryland agriculture.

However, the correlation between bacterial diversity and community structure, and soil nutrients is unknown, and a systematic understanding of their responses to straw retention is lacking. In the field experiment, the straw retention treatments included no straw (NS), half straw (HS), and total straw (TS) retention during long-term wheat-soybean rotation. The mean contents of soil total nitrogen (TN), nitrate-N (NO3--N), and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) increased by 15.06%, 21.10%, and 38.23%, respectively, with straw retention relative to NS, while that of ammonium-N (NH4+-N) reduced by 3.68%. The concentration of carbon components increased as straw retention increased. The levels of soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and soil organic carbon (SOC) increased by 4.34%, 7.63%, and 9.34%, respectively, with straw retention relative to NS. Soil bacterial alpha diversity was reduced with straw retention. Soil pH and nutrient content were identified as the main factors affecting the soil microbial diversity and structure at the phylum level. Accordingly, straw retention and soybean-wheat rotation enable sustainable agriculture in the dryland of northern China.					德杰, 孔/GRR-8605-2022	德杰, 孔/0000-0001-5749-5890; ren, guang xin/0000-0001-9895-2680														2073-4395				SEP	2022	12	9							2126	10.3390/agronomy12092126	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12092126													WOS:000856163400001

ENHANCING SUSTAINABILITY AND FODDER PRODUCTION OF LOWLAND PASTURES THROUGH FENCING AND CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE IN ARID AGRO-PASTORAL ECOSYSTEMS	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The short-term fencing effects on vegetation in dryland landscape depressions are analyzed and the economic performance of grazing-only and integrated grazing with cropping in regard to land capital are compared. The goal is to suggest efficient strategic choices and more profitable land allocation of lowlands in dry areas. To analyze the vegetation, 12 cages each 2 m2 were installed at three sides of a depression (4 east, 4 middle and 4 west side). Natural vegetation was recorded in the inside and outside cages during the spring of 2015, 2016 and 2018. Pastoral productivity was also calculated. To study the economic performance of cropping systems, local owner-farmers representing three cropped areas (1, 3 and 9 ha) were interviewed using socioeconomic surveys. The main results showed that short-term fencing increased diversity (24% to 61% in the middle cages). This improvement is due to annuals and the recruitment of palatable perennials. Economic evaluation showed that grazing is more profitable than integrated management, except for diversified and large cropped areas. The strategic recommendations for efficient, profitable and sustainable lowland allocation are short-term fencing with grazing-only in small depressions, and diversified crops mixed with grazing in larger depressions.

Macrofossil evidence of alder (<i>Alnus</i> sp.) in Britain early in the Late Glacial Interstadial: implications for the northern cryptic refugia debate	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Wood macrofossil remains of alder and willow/poplar have been recovered from a sediment sequence in the valley of the Turker Beck in the Vale of Mowbray, North Yorkshire. These remains have yielded radiocarbon dates early in the Devensian Late Glacial (14.7-14k cal a bp), equivalent to the early part of the Greenland Interstadial (GI-1e) of the GRIP ice-core record. These are the earliest dates recorded for the presence of alder in the Late Glacial in the British Isles. Associated biological remains have provided a palaeoenvironmental record for this early part of the Greenland Interstadial, generally indicative of open environments dominated by herbaceous taxa on both the wetland and dryland surfaces. However, stands of alder, birch and willow woodland were also present, and indicate the possibility that such tree species survived in cryptic refugia in Britain as elsewhere in northern Europe during the Last Glacial Maximum. The absence of alder pollen at Turker Beck, in a sequence in which its macrofossil remains are relatively abundant, lends support to the view that pollen can be a poor indicator of the presence of tree species in Late Glacial sequences in northern and western Europe.

But the quality attributes viz., crude fibre, total carbohydrate and crude protein content of fodder maize were not influenced by seed rates.

Analysing the potential for CAM-fed bio-economic uses in sub-Saharan Africa	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) plants have the potential to provide future-proof biomass growth under increasingly stressed climatic conditions. Using active cultivation and anaerobic digestion, CAM plants can be grown and fermented to produce biogas or hydrolysed to extract valuable volatile fatty acids (VFAs) which can be applied to a range of uses: energy provision, protein and bioplastic production, carbon sequestration. How-ever, an understanding of the spatial potential for CAM plants to be actively grown and harvested for bio-economic uses across Africa is unknown. A combined conservative assessment which incorporates three key dimensions is lacking from the literature: i) where can CAM plants physiologically grow? ii) where can CAM plants be cultivated without competing with existing land use? and iii) where lies the greatest energy demand? Answering these three questions and mapping the spatial variability between these aspects is essential to the future bioplastics/protein sector and opportunity to capitalise on generating sustainable energy which can connect off-grid rural and peri-urban communities whilst also achieving climate change mitigation targets. Using Opuntia ficus-indica as an example, this study compares two measures of land suitability estimation based on ecophysiological requirements and social, environmental and land-use masks. Focusing on abandoned land, conservative baseline estimates suggest that c.28-55 million hectares of land may be suitable for active CAM cultivation, with the potential to repurpose degraded lands and provide alternative bio-economic livelihoods to communities across semi-arid regions of Africa.

Ultra-high-resolution mapping of biocrusts with Unmanned Aerial Systems	REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) occur in drylands globally where they support ecosystem functioning by increasing soil stability, reducing dust emissions and modifying soil resource availability (e.g. water, nutrients). Determining biocrust condition and extent across landscapes continues to present considerable challenges to scientists and land managers. Biocrusts grow in patches, cover vast expanses of rugged terrain and are vulnerable to physical disturbance associated with ground-based mapping techniques. As such, remote sensing offers promising opportunities to map and monitor biocrusts. While satellite-based remote sensing has been used to detect biocrusts at relatively large spatial scales, few studies have used high-resolution imagery from Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) to map fine-scale patterns of biocrusts. We collected sub-centimeter, true color 3-band imagery at 10 plots in sagebrush and pinyon-juniper woodland communities in a semiarid ecosystem in the southwestern US and used object-based image analysis (OBIA) to segment and classify the imagery into maps of light and dark biocrusts, bare soil, rock and various vegetation covers. We used field data to validate the classifications and assessed the spatial distribution and configuration of different classes using fragmentation metrics. Map accuracies ranged from 46 to 77% (average 65%) and were higher in pinyon-juniper (average 70%) versus sagebrush (average 60%) plots. Biocrust classes showed generally high accuracies at both pinyon-juniper plots (average dark crust = 70%; light crust = 80%) and sagebrush plots (average dark crust = 69%; light crust = 77%). Point cloud density, sun elevation and spectral confusion between vegetation cover explained some differences in accuracy across plots. Spatial analyses of classified maps showed that biocrust patches in pinyon-juniper plots were generally larger, more aggregated and contiguous than in sagebrush plots. Pinyon-juniper plots also had greater patch richness and a lower Shannon evenness index than sagebrush plots, suggesting greater soil cover heterogeneity in this plant community type.

A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of farmyard manure (FYM) and enrichment planting with improved forages on biomass yield, nutritional value, and soil chemical properties in dryland areas of northwestern Ethiopia. The experiment was carried out using a randomized complete block design with three replications for 2 yr. Natural pasture plots were seeded and treated with Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) or desho grass (Pennisetum pedicellatum), Napier or desho + FYM, Napier or desho + Desmodium, and Napier or desho + FYM + Desmodium; untreated plots were used as controls. In the yr 2019, after treatment application the overall herbaceous species identified in the experimental plots were grasses (64%), legumes (22%), and forbs (14%). In all treatment groups, legumes dominate in the first yr while grasses dominate in the second yr. Within treatment groups, dry matter yield (DMY) increment was recorded from the first yr to the second yr, by values ranging from 2.9% to 23.0%. The mean DMY in the desho + FYM + Desmodium uncinatum plots (8.4 t ha-1) was higher (P < 0.001) than controls (4.4 t ha-1). Natural pasture treated with Napier or desho in conjunction with either Desmodium or FYM and their combinations had a higher crude protein content (P < 0.001) than natural pasture alone despite the fact that in vitro organic matter digestibility was higher in desho grass when combined with desmodium or FYM treatments. Plots treated with Napier + FYM, Napier + Desmodium, and desho + Desmodium + FYM showed organic carbon levels that were significantly (P < 0.001) higher than the controls. Overall, desho + FYM + Desmodium produced the greatest improvement in grazing land productivity by maintaining soil fertility. (c) 2023 The Society for Range Management. Published by Elsevier Inc.

J	Wu, B; Wang, ZL; Zhang, QW; Shen, N; Liu, J				Wu, Bing; Wang, Zhanli; Zhang, Qingwei; Shen, Nan; Liu, June			Evaluating and modelling splash detachment capacity based on laboratory experiments	CATENA												Splash erosion is recognized as an important process of water erosion on agricultural land, but evaluating and modelling splash detachment capacity on steep slopes using loessial soil were not fully studied. The objectives of this study are: (1) to evaluate the effects of slope gradient (S) and rainfall intensity (I) on splash detachment capacity (SDr), (2) to select the key rainfall physical parameters and hydraulic parameters affecting splash detachment capacity, (3) to establish new and more accurate experimental models between splash detachment capacity (SDr) and these key parameters on steep slopes for loess regions. The experiment was conducted at slopes of 12.23%, 17.63%, 26.8%, 36.4%, 40.4% and 46.63% under rainfall intensities of 48, 60, 90, 120, 138 and 150 mm h(-1) , respectively, using simulated rainfall. Results showed that the equation between splash detachment capacity (SDr) with both parameters of rainfall intensity (I) and slope gradient (S) (i.e. SDr = 0.000126 In (0.36S(-0.3)I(1.3) - 14)) could predict SDr well with R-2 = 0.85 and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) = 0.71. SDr was more sensitive to rainfall intensity than to slope gradient. The rainfall kinetic energy (KE) was the key rainfall physical parameter and the mean flow depth (h) was the key hydraulic parameter affecting SDr. The equation between SDr with both parameters of KE and h (i.e. SDr = 0.000164 In (0.0031KE(1.13) h(-0.3) - 4.5)) could satisfactorily predict SDr with R-2 = 0.85 and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) = 0.81. The new equations (i.e. SDr = 0.000126 ln (0.36S(-0.3)I(1.3) - 14) and SDr = 0.000164 In (0.0031KE(1.13)h(-0.3) - 4.5)) could help in controlling water erosion in the loess region of China.

However, there is limited knowledge regarding the effects of the interactions between BC and nitrogen (N) on soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization at an interannual scale. We conducted a three-year field experiment to systematically reveal the impacts of BC combined with N fertilizer on a silty day soil, including its physicochemical properties, soil respiration characteristics and microbial community. BC applied once at 0, 20 and 40 t ha(-1) (B0, B1 and B2, respectively) was combined with three N fertilization levels (0, 120 and 240 kg N ha(-1); N0, N1 and N2, respectively). Only winter wheat (Triticum aestivwn L.) was cultivated, and it was cultivated in a winter wheat-summer fallow crop system. BC application persistently increased the SOC content by 36.3-91.6% over three years. Several soil parameters were also improved by BC combined with N after one year, such as bulk density, NO3- and available P content. Compared with its values with BO treatments with N1 or N2, the total soil CO2 emitted decreased by 6.7-8.9% in response to BC combined with N1 but increased by 5.9-7.5% in response to BC combined with N2. B1N1 not only significantly increased microbial biomass but also decreased qCO(2). In addition, B1N1 in particular increased the relative abundances of members of the microbial population associated with increased microbial C use efficiency, such as Rhizopus and Helotiaceae. However, B2N1 and B2N2 strongly disturbed the soil microbial ecosystem; moreover, the lowest alpha diversity of the bacterial community was observed in B2N2 soils. In summary, adding BC at a high rate to N-fertilized soil strongly disturbs the soil microbial ecosystem and reduces the C-sequestering potential of soil, while B1N1 treatment is recommended to enhance soil C sequestration and improve soil fertility under dryland farming.

Litter decomposition rates are determined by the interplay of climate, decomposer organisms and litter quality. It has been suggested that the decomposer community may be locally adapted to litter quality, providing a home-field advantage (HFA) resulting in accelerated decomposition of local compared to non-local litter, after accounting for decomposition differences due to litter quality and the functional capacity of microorganisms. Although widely tested in forests, this hypothesis remains controversial and lacks support of its generality across climates. 2. We therefore tested the HFA hypothesis for litter decomposition in four contrasting ecosystems along an extensive climatic gradient in Chile, using a translocation experiment involving litter from 20 species. In addition to comparing mass loss, we adopted a novel way to disentangle decomposer effects from climate effects, based on loss rates of elements that are actively released from the litter by decomposers during its breakdown versus elements that are simply leached by precipitation. We used the ratios of nitrogen and potassium losses (N/K loss) and phosphorus and potassium losses (P/K loss) to unravel the relative role of microbial breakdown (N and P loss) versus physical leaching (K loss) along the climate gradient. Thus, at each site, we tested whether litter mass loss, N/K loss and P/K loss presented an additional loss due to a HFA for local compared to non-local litter. 3. Across a wide range of environments and litter types, our findings unequivocally contradicted the HFA hypothesis. We observed no significantly positive HFA along the gradient; however, litter quality and the general ability of the decomposer community influenced litter decomposition much more strongly than origin or location of the litter. 4. Our study questions the applicability of the HFA for litter decomposition and calls for more studies that include a large range of climatic conditions to understand the context-dependency of HFA.

In particular, quantifying such memory effects associated with the influence of past environmental (exogenous) and biological (endogenous) conditions is crucial for understanding and predicting the carbon cycle. Here we show, using data from 42 eddy covariance sites across six major biomes, that ecological memory-decomposed into environmental and biological memory components-of daily net carbon exchange (NEE) is critical for understanding the land-carbon metabolism, especially in drylands for which memory explains similar to 32% of the variation in NEE. The strong environmental memory in drylands was primarily driven by short- and long-term moisture status. Moreover, the strength of environmental memory scales with increasing water stress. This universal scaling relationship, emerging within and among major biomes, suggests a potential adaptive response to water limitation. Our findings underscore the necessity of considering ecological memory in experiments, observations and modelling.

The study analyzes the sediment flow behavior in relation to the flood patterns in the Xichuan River catchment on the Loess Plateau. Based on 23-year hydrological data collected from Zaoyuan hydrological station and K-medoids clustering method, one hundred and twelve flood events data were classified into four flood patterns. The hydrologic features of different flood patterns exhibit significant differences. The values of the mean runoff depth, the mean flood duration, and the mean flood peak discharge decreased as the following order: Pattern A > Pattern C > Pattern D > Pattern B. Each flood pattern results in differing levels of the event sediment yield (SY), the SY of Pattern A (10,275.33 t.km(-2)) and Pattern C (1196.39 t.km(-2)) were larger than those from Pattern B (218.84 t.km(-2)) and Pattern D (693.84 t.km(-2)). These results indicated that greater attention should be paid to Pattern A and Pattern C because of the largest sediment delivery effect. Multiple stepwise regressions analysis suggested that the contribution of main runoff-related factors to event sediment yield varied with different flood patterns. In addition, hysteretic analysis between suspended sediment concentration and runoff suggested that counter-clockwise and figure-eight loops were the dominant loops. The results provided a useful information to flood pattern classifications and suspended sediment dynamics research, and enriched the sediment control theory at the watershed scale.

A case study from New Mexico, USA	GEODERMA												To sustainably manage rangelands, it is paramount that all agents of soil health are considered in conservation practices. Yet, our understanding of the extent and importance of biological soil crust (hereafter biocrust) as a component of rangeland health and quality is limited. The objective of this project was to quantify and characterize rangeland biocrusts within a region of New Mexico, USA, for which soil microbes have yet to be considered in rangeland health assessments: the Rio Puerco Watershed. Moreover, we examined the influence of biocrust on soil aggregate stability as key ecosystem service in a landscape prone to erosion. We further assessed the relationships between biocrust abundance and community composition with soil properties. We found that biocrusts covered an average of 41% of plant interspaces throughout all sampling locations (n = 20), with the most abundant types being incipient and light cyanobacterial crusts, which tend to be more cryptic in appearance. Soil surface stability was greater than subsurface stability and biocrust cover was positively related to soil surface stability. Light cyanobacterial and cyanolichen crusts were the primary biocrust types related to soil surface stability, especially on sites with unconsolidated subsurfaces. Physical soil crusts were also a major landscape component covering an average of 21% of the soil and were important for subsurface stability. These findings reflect the importance of biological and physical soil aggregating processes in dryland systems. Several environmental variables were related to biocrust community composition and aggregate stability, with surface soil texture, salt contents, pH, and soil nitrogen ions having the strongest relationships. This study expands the biocrust characterizations of drylands in a region that has received little attention. It further contributes new insights on how biocrust and soil microbial communities may play a role in influencing rangeland health, providing much needed data for a watershed characterized by its high susceptibility to soil loss.

CV-1193, PI 695072) is a spring durum wheat [Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum (Desf.)] developed by the Montana Agricultural Experiment Station and released in 2020. Lustre was bred using the single seed descent method and was selected for its yield performance under dryland conditions across Montana, low grain Cd accumulation, good pasta firmness, high grain protein, high yellow semolina color, and low semolina ash. Lustre performs well in both the north central and northeast regions of Montana, where most Montana durum is produced and intended for pasta production. Lustre has similar stripe rust tolerance and susceptibility as top-grown durum cultivars in the state with susceptibility at the seedling stage and high-temperature adult-plant resistance. Lustre is moderately susceptible to Fusarium head blight like other durum cultivars. Lustre is resistant to the predominant races of stem and leaf rust and is moderately tolerant to fungal leaf spot complex. Lustre is approximately 89 cm tall, with a yellow green color and a heading date 1 d later than the cultivar 'Mountrail'. Lustre has an erect flag leaf and an erect tapering head having white glumes and awns.

Engagement with conservation tillage shaped by "good farmer" identity	AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES												The "good farmer" literature, grounded in Bourdieu's concepts of field, habitus, and capital, has provided researchers with a socio-cultural approach to understanding conservation adoption behavior. The good farmer literature suggests that conservation practices may not be widely accepted because they do not allow farmers to demonstrate symbols of good farming. This lens has not been applied to the adoption of conservation tillage (CT), a practice increasingly used to improve conservation outcomes, farming efficiency and crop productivity. Drawing from in-depth interviews (n = 28) with dryland wheat farmers in the US inland Pacific Northwest (iPNW), this research seeks to understand how farmers' engagement with CT is shaped by identity as a good farmer. Some farmers also sought to bolster social capital through CT by maintaining and strengthening relationships with peers, landowners, and future generations. We further found that engagement with CT provided a link for some participants between productivist values and stewardship values within the good farming identity. The findings from this research may help contextualize the barriers and opportunities to the adoption of agricultural conservation practices within farmer-specific social, cultural, and economic forms of capital.

For this purpose, SST and rainfall data were used to study a wide range of inhomogeneous areas in Ethiopia with uneven distribution of rainfall for both summer (1951-2015) and spring (1951-2000) seasons. Firstly, a preliminary subdivision of rainfall grid points into zones was applied depending on spatial homogeneity and seasonality of rainfall. This introduced new clusters, including nine zones for summer rainfall peak (July/August) and five zones for spring rainfall peak (April/May). Afterward, the time series for each zone was derived by calculating the rainfall averaged over grid points within the zone. Secondly, the oceanic regions that significantly correlated with the Ethiopian rainfall were identified through cross-correlations between rainfalls averaged over every homogeneous zone and the monthly averaged SST. For summer rainfall as a main rainy season, the results indicated that the Gulf of Guinea and southern Pacific Ocean had a significant influence on rainfall zones at a lag time of 5-6 and 6-7 months. Besides, for summer rainfall zones 8 and 9 at lag time 5-6 months, the common SST regions of the southern Pacific Ocean showed the opposite sense of positive and negative correlations. Thus, the difference in SSTs between the two regions was more strongly correlated (r >= 0.46) with summer rainfall in both zones than others. For the spring season, the results indicated that SST of the northern Atlantic Ocean had a strong influence on spring rainfall zones (3 and 5) at a lag time 6-7 months, as indicated by a significant correlation (r >= -0.40). Therefore, this study suggests that SSTs of southern Pacific and northern Atlantic oceans can be used as effective inputs for prediction models of Ethiopian summer and spring rainfalls, respectively.

The Bronze Age Xiaohe settlements (ca. 4000-3300 cal yr BP) are situated in the extremely arid Tarim Basin of northwest China and exemplify a societal collapse which included a long-distance movement along river catchments. Here, we present the results of stable carbon isotope values (delta C-13) of archaeobotanical remains, sedimentary faces analysis from the Tarim River catchment, and a compilation of palaeo-environmental evidence in order to investigate potential relationships between regional environmental changes and the response of prehistoric societies in this arid region. Results suggest that the early Xiaohe population was forced to migrate as a consequence of the deterioration of hydrological conditions around settlements. The decline of Xiaohe Culture occurred in the context of decreasing water availability in the basin interior due to climatic change lasting several hundred years. Results are potentially significant for the management of ecologically fragile dryland habitats, particularly the watershed terminus area, threatened by ongoing climate change, specifically in the context of the need to manage scarce water resources to promote sustainable socioeconomic development.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				FEB	2023	33	2					194	207		10.1177/09596836221131694	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836221131694		NOV 2022											WOS:000878794400001

However, an integrated understanding of biogeographical patterns of the specialist Haloarchaea and the potential generalist ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) across large-scale environmental gradients remains limited. We hypothesize that niche differentiation determines their distinct distributions along environmental gradients. To test the hypothesis, we use a continental-scale research network including 173 dryland sites across northern China. Our results demonstrate that Haloarchaea and AOA dominate topsoil archaeal communities. As hypothesized, Haloarchaea and AOA show strong niche differentiation associated with two ecosystem types mainly found in China's drylands (i.e. deserts vs. grasslands), and they differ in the degree of habitat specialization. The relative abundance and richness of Haloarchaea are higher in deserts due to specialization to relatively high soil salinity and extreme climates, while those of AOA are greater in grassland soils. Our results further indicate a divergence in ecological processes underlying the segregated distributions of Haloarchaea and AOA. Haloarchaea are governed primarily by environmental-based processes while the more generalist AOA are assembled mostly via spatial-based processes. Our findings add to existing knowledge of large-scale biogeography of topsoil archaea, advancing our predictive understanding on changes in topsoil archaeal communities in a drier world.

In light of this background, field trials were conducted in secondary saline soil (EC 6.5 dS m(-1)) at the experimental station of Tashkent State Agrarian University (TSAU), Uzbekistan to determine drought tolerance of licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) by exposure to four levels of water deficit, namely control (70-80%), moderate (50-60%), strong (30-40%) and intense (10-20%) relative water content (WC) in the soil. The moderate drought stress exhibited positive effects on the morphological and physiological parameters of licorice, and was considered to be the most suitable water regime for licorice cultivation. Plant growth under the 50-60% WC treatment was slightly higher as compared to 70-80% WC treatment, exhibiting weak water deficit promotes licorice growth, root yield and secondary metabolite production. In particular, secondary metabolites i.e., ash, glycyrrhizic acid, extractive compounds and flavonoids, tended to increase under moderate water deficit, however further drought intensification brought a sharp decline of these values. These results contribute to the development of licorice cultivation technologies in arid regions and the most important consideration is the restoration of ecological and economical functions of the dryland agricultural system.

Simulated rainfall experiments were conducted on a clayey loessal soil at three rainfall intensities (42, 60 and 90 mm h(-1)), five slope gradients (7 degrees, 10 degrees, 15 degrees, 20 degrees and 25 degrees) and rainfall duration of 40 min. Results showed that raindrop detachment rate initially decreased rapidly within a few minutes and then reached a relative steady state during rainfall. The initial and steady raindrop detachment rate increased with increased rainfall intensity. Interrill wash rate peaked early and then decreased to a relative constant rate during the rainfall. The initial, maximum and steady interrill wash rate increased with increased rainfall intensity and slope gradient. Erosion-limiting degree (ELD), defined as the ratio of interrill wash rate to raindrop detachment rate, ranged from 10.99% to 35.70% under experimental conditions, indicating that interrill erosion system was transport-limited. The ELD decreased with rainfall intensity and increased linearly (R-2 = 0.90) with slope gradient. The higher the rainfall intensity, the stronger the transport-limiting in interrill erosion processes; the steeper the slope gradient, the weaker the transport-limiting in interrill erosion processes. Raindrop detachment is the dominant process in detaching soil particles, whereas interrill flow contributes to washing out detached sediments. The findings of this study, especially ELD, largely improved the understanding of interrill erosion processes.					tian, na/GVR-9226-2022														0022-1694	1879-2707				AUG	2019	575						1280	1287		10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.06.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.06.004													WOS:000488143000100

The present study aimed to determine how photosynthetic anatomy affects wheat (Triticum aestivum) photosynthetic rate and yield. Gas exchange and anatomical characteristics of the flag leaf and ear were compared in different ploidy wheats (diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid) under well-watered (WW) and water-stressed (WS) conditions. The photosynthetic rate of the ear (P-N_ear) decreased to a lesser extent than that of the flag leaf (P-N_leaf) under WS and that the P-N_ear of tetraploid wheat decreased the least. Furthermore, the integral water-use efficiency (WUEi) of tetraploid wheat increased the most among the three wheat species. The anatomical characteristics varied not only between the WW and WS conditions but also between the three wheat species; tetraploid species showed higher stomatal frequency (SF), stomatal area per organ area (SA), vein distance (D-V), and bundle-sheath cell number (N-BS), and lower vein distance in the glume and lemma. Correlation analysis showed that grain yield presented significant positive correlation with the P-N_leaf, P-N_ear, and WUEi. The P-N_leaf was affected by stomatal length (SL), stomatal width, and SA, while the P-N_ear was affected by SF, SA, and stomatal size in the ear organs. The WUEi was generally positively correlated with SL, N-V, and N-BS in the ear organs. The higher vein density and well-developed bundle sheath of tetraploid species may contribute to the higher P-N_ear and lower decrease in grain yield.

Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of biocrust effects on topsoil thermal properties and temperature (T) are still unclear. In this study, we continuously measured thermal properties of moss-dominated biocrusts and bare soil (aeolian sand) at 1 cm depth by utilizing heat pulse probes for one year on the Chinese Loess Plateau. The surface soil water content (theta), net all-wave radiation (J(n)), surface albedo (alpha), heat flux (G), and other properties were further measured to analyze their connections with soil thermal properties. Our results indicated that biocrusts decreased (F >= 1.91, P <= 0.031) heat capacity (C), thermal conductivity (lambda), and thermal diffusivity (k) by 1.6% (1.36 vs. 1.38 MJ m(-3) K-1), 11.6% (0.62 vs. 0.69 W m(-1) K-1), and 8.7% (0.62 vs. 0.69 x 10(-7) m(2) s (-1)) on average, respectively, in contrast to bare soil. Moreover, biocrusts variously regulated soil thermal properties in dry and wet seasons owing to the influences of rainfall events and theta As compared with bare soil, the C,lambda and. of biocrusts in dry season (Nov.Apr.) were decreased by 5.7%, 19.0%, and 12.2%, respectively; while only the C was increased by 2.2% by biocrusts in wet season, but the lambda and kappa of biocrusts were similar to that of bare soil. Furthermore, biocrusts increased. both in dry (by 5.0 times) and wet (by 3.5 times) seasons as compared with bare soil. Especially, biocrusts decreased a by 32.1% (0.19 vs. 0.28) and G (at 8 cm depth) by 20.0% (0.8 vs. 1.0 W m(-2) s(-1)), and increased Jn by 30.1% (73.0 vs. 56.1 W m(-2)) in comparison to bare soil. Lastly, combining with the higher. and lower a as well as the lower soil thermal properties, biocrusts greatly increased T by 1.7 degrees C (up to 4.5. C; P < 0.001) on average. In conclusion, moss-dominated biocrusts have great regulating effects on surface soil thermal properties and T, and these effects are mostly attributed to their lower bulk density and alpha but higher porosity and water-holding capacity, which further change surface theta and T regimes and play a vital role in soil water and heat balances as well as other critical processes in drylands.

Yield and its components, evapotranspiration, and accumulation and apparent remobilisation of stem water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) were measured to understand the effects of root pruning and its interactions with seeding rate, water and nitrogen supply. Two factorial studies under straw mulching with continuous wheat were established in the Loess Plateau of China. Study 1 was repeated over four seasons and included six treatments from the combination of three root treatments, i.e. root pruning in winter before dormancy (RPw), root pruning at the re-green stage in spring (RPs) and untreated control (CK), and two seeding rates. Study 2 was repeated over three seasons and included twelve treatments from the combination of two root treatments (RPs and CK), two nitrogen rates and three pre-sowing soil water levels. Yield ranged from 2571 to 7722 kg ha(-1), harvest index from 0.28 to 0.56, and water-use efficiency from 5 to 20 kg ha(-1) mm(-1). Root pruning improved grain yield, harvest index and water-use efficiency by 6-11% across environmental conditions. Grain yield increased more (i) by pruning roots in spring than in winter, (ii) in high plant density than in low plant density crops, and (iii) in low-yielding conditions. It is concluded that spring root pruning is a viable option to improve wheat yield and water use efficiency under straw mulching in semiarid environment.					王, 娅冰/JGE-0541-2023; sun, jiamin/JPY-2155-2023; Sadras, Victor/D-5122-2013	Hu, Changlu/0000-0003-4106-3916; Sadras, Victor/0000-0002-5874-6775													0378-4290	1872-6852				JAN 1	2019	230						62	71		10.1016/j.fcr.2018.10.013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2018.10.013													WOS:000452932100006

However, the plant growth and competitiveness of co-dominant species in response to the changes in the amount and timing of soil water are still unclear. Thus, two co-dominant species, Bothriochloa ischaemum and Lespedeza davurica, were grown in seven mixture ratios under three watering regimes [80 +/- 5% pot soil capacity (FC) (high watering), 60 +/- 5% FC (moderate watering), and 40 +/- 5% FC (low watering)] in a pot experiment. The soil water contents were rapidly improved from low to moderate water and from moderate to high water, respectively, at the heading, flowering, and maturity stages of B. ischaemum, and were maintained until the end of the growing season of each species. The biomass production of both species increased significantly with the increased soil water contents, particularly at the heading and flowering periods, with a more pronounced increase in B. ischaemum in the mixtures. The root/shoot ratio of both species was decreased when the soil water availability increased at the heading or flowering periods. The total biomass production, water use efficiency (WUE), and relative yield total (RYT) increased gradually with the increase of B. ischaemum in the mixtures. The relative competition intensity was below zero in B. ischaemum, and above zero in L. davurica. The competitive balance index calculated for B. ischaemum was increased with the increase of the soil water contents. Bothriochloa ischaemum responded more positively to the periodical increase in soil water availability than L. davurica, indicating that the abundance of B. ischaemum could increase in relatively wet seasons or plenty-rainfall periods. In addition, the mixture ratio of 10:2 (B. ischaemum to L. davurica) was the most compatible combination for the improved biomass production, WUE, and RYTs across all soil water treatments.

Nevertheless, past research on the erosion on spoil heaps has focused on soil particles that were readily eroded and disregarded the rock fragments (RF) that were not readily eroded. To explore the effect of the RF embedded in spoil heaps on the hydraulics of and erosion caused by concentrated runoff, scour-erosion experiments were implemented on three types of spoil heaps: RF = 7%, RF = 45%, and RF = 69%. The RF clearly reduced runoff and erosion on steep spoil heaps. As the RF increased from 7% to 69%, the runoff intensity and runoff coefficient decreased by 72.9%-79.1% and 83.2%-84.1% respectively, and the sediment concentration, soil denudation rate, and total soil loss decreased by 36.0%-47.8%, 83.7%-87.1%, and 87.0%-92.3%, respectively. Narrow rills were generated during the experiments, and the RF distinctly influenced the rill characteristics. High contents of RF restrained rill retreating and undercutting, and promoted rill widening. With an increase in RF, the flow shear stress and stream power gradually decreased, and the DarcyeWeisbach roughness coefficient increased. These findings imply that the RF dissipated the flow energy and reduced soil detachment capacity and sediment transport capacity. Soil detachment is strongly related to the DarcyeWeisbach roughness coefficient, Reynolds number, and runoff intensity, which may be the preferred descriptors of soil detachment. The current findings indicate that embedded rock fragments could effectively reduce soil loss on steep spoil heaps.

G.; Parton, Ash; Leenman, Anya			Morphology and controls of the mountain-front fan systems of the Hajar Mountains, south-east Arabia	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Mountain-front fans are an important part of the global sediment system, acting as buffers and stores of sediment between upland sources and down-system sinks. Fans emanate from the Hajar Mountains in the eastern UAE and northern Oman which have developed from morphologically and geologically variable catchments and in a range of depositional settings, as well as spanning a wide range of shapes and sizes. There has been little prior research into the drivers of regional fan evolution and morphology at the landform scale, considering specific factors such as source-area morphology and geology and distal settings. We use remotely sensed data to map 438 fans and catchments along mountain fronts in Oman and the UAE. These data provide, for the first time, a regional overview of fan morphology using key morphometric parameters and demonstrate the utility of a remote sensing approach to understanding regional landform morphology of features at a range of spatial scales (10-3-104 km2). Comparing this large dataset to studies of dryland fans globally, we show that Hajar fan morphology spans almost every order of magnitude previously recorded elsewhere. It shows statistically the importance of diverse catchment and depositional setting controls on alluvial fan morphology. Across the different mountain fronts of the Hajar range, fan morphology is controlled by 1) catchment morphology and geology, 2) changes in base level and 3) long-term climatic changes and tectonic processes, although the importance of these factors relative to one another is highly spatially variable. The fans of the Musandam Peninsula drain younger rocks, are situated in an area of subsidence and have experienced foreshortening due to Quaternary sea-level variability, hence pro-duce the smallest, steepest fans. Similarly, many of the fans of the Batinah Coast are influenced by distal fore-shortening by sea-level rise and demonstrate weak regression relationships with their catchment morphologies. By contrast, the large fans of the Rub'al Khali are mostly distally unconfined and drain large catchments composed of relatively older rock types, thus producing large fans and megafans with the strongest fan -catchment morphometric relationships. The Wahiba Sands fans are similar to those of the Rub'al Khali but are limited in their extent by erosion from an axial river system. As such, the fans of the Hajar are an important natural laboratory for investigating alluvial fan morphology, processes and long-term evolution in response to a range of controls. This includes potentially acting as analogues to extra-terrestrial fan systems due to their large scales in some areas dryland context. For example, the largest megafans of the Hajar display morphometric similarities to large fluvial fans reported on Saturn's moon, Titan, perhaps suggesting comparable long-term controls.																			0012-8252	1872-6828				FEB	2023	237								104316	10.1016/j.earscirev.2023.104316	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2023.104316		JAN 2023											WOS:000925233400001

Rainfall intensity (I) and slope gradient (S), as well as rainfall kinetic energy (KE), runoff depth (h) and runoff velocity (v) have important effects on splash-detached sediment size. The objectives of this study were to explore the responses of the size-selective characteristics (expressed by mean weight diameter, MWD) of splash-detached sediments to I and S, and to identify the relationships of MWD of splash-detached sediments with KE, h and v. Simulated rainfall experiments were conducted on clay loam under different rainfall intensities (0.7, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5mm min(-1)) and slope gradients (7, 10, 15, 20, and 25 degrees) at the simulated rainfall hall in Yangling, China in 2017. Results showed that the MWD was 72.74-164.17 mu m for the splash-detached sediments, which was lower than that of the soil matrix (183.23 mu m). MWD increased logarithmically with increasing S, and MWD first increased and then decreased with increasing I or ICE parabolically. The relationship of MWD with I and S can be described by an exponential-power combination equation (MWD = 216 e(-1.251) I-1.81 S-0.28, R-2 = 0.88). MWD was negatively related to h and positively related to v. Comprehensive response of MWD to KE, h and v can be described by an exponential-power combination equation (MWD = 0.33 e(-0.002) KE1.18 h(-0.20) v(0.27), R-2 = 0.85). These findings showed that splash-detached sediment size was significantly affected by I and S, as well as ICE, h and v. The study could be helpful in soil conservation management for similar conditions of soil, rainfall and land use.					tian, na/GVR-9226-2022; Guo, QI/HQY-9560-2023														0167-1987	1879-3444				APR	2020	198								104539	10.1016/j.still.2019.104539	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2019.104539													WOS:000515443600006

To ensure peer educators continue to provide peer-led education programs, it is important that they remain motivated to instruct patients. Here, to explore measures to enhance peer-educators' motivation toward such programs, we examined the cognitive and emotional changes in Filipino type 2 diabetics after 7-month activities as peer educators. Methods We individually performed semi-structured interviews with 13 peer educators with 20 years of age or above in August 2017 (immediately before starting their peer-education activities) and in March 2018 (7 months after the start). The first interview was performed after the peer educators had received 2-day training of diabetes self-management. In both interviews, we asked the peer educators about their feelings toward peer-led educational activities (e.g., satisfaction, difficulty, reward, confidence, and challenges). Their replies about their own cognition and emotions were interpreted and integrated, and then analyzed qualitatively. Results Four and seven categories were extracted from the first and second interviews, respectively. The category "Cognition of patients' active learning attitudes and of positive changes in patients' physical conditions and behavior" observed in the second interview led to "Cognition of growth as a peer educator" and "Satisfaction with supporting patients as a peer educator." These two feelings gave the peer educators' "Increased motivation to continue the activities as a peer educator." This motivation was also associated with "Active collaboration among peer educators," which was affected by "Difficulties and concerns in working as a peer educator." Conclusion To sustain diabetic peer-led education programs, we suggest that interventions be implemented that increase peer educators' motivation toward their activities and stimulate their awareness of the importance of collaborating with one another. Such collaboration should help to overcome the difficulties they may face in providing peer-led education.

CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS												Salinity is challenging agriculture by reducing crop productivity. Endophytes from halophyte plants have the potential to alleviate salinity stress in crops. Here, 78 bacterial strains were recovered from 10 habitat-adapted halophyte plants in the central deserts of Iran. Eight superior halotolerant strains tolerating 3 M NaCl, were identified as the Gram-positive genera Bacillus and Oceanobacillus (Bacillaceae), Brachybacterium (Dermabacteraceae), Micrococcus (Micrococcaceae), and Salinicoccus (Staphylococcaceae). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the most halotolerant strain, i.e., Salinicoccus hispanicus, experienced accelerated binary fission under salinity. Furthermore, seeds of the two winter wheat cultivars, i.e., cv. Homa (rain-fed) and cv. Mihan (irrigated), inoculated by those bacteria, showed enhanced germination indices under different salinity gradients, and also under normal conditions. Indeed, the superior bacteria, i.e., Oceanobacillus sp. strain 76, Micrococcus luteus strain 14, and Bacillus sp. strain 7, enhanced seed germination indices in both wheat cultivars including final seed germinations, as well as the root, shoot and seedling lengths. These strains were capable of producing the plant hormone auxin (IAA). Thus, we propose that halotolerant endophytic bacteria from desert-adapted halophyte plants could alleviate salinity stress in strategic crops such as the wheat Triticum aestivum L., especially in dryland farming.

Granivorous ants prefer small and unprotected seeds-implications for restoration in arid ecosystems	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Successful seed-based restoration in dryland systems is difficult due to the many limitations associated with germination and establishment. Seed predators, including granivorous ants, can consume or move applied seeds offsite reducing restoration success. Granivorous ants in the U.S. southwest move and store tens of thousands of seeds and show preferences for seeds based on weight, size, nutrient content, and novelty. In this study, we examine which seed traits most influence seed predation rates in a grassland in southwestern Arizona, U.S.A. We presented 24 seed types from native species with restoration value in three cafeteria-style selection areas installed adjacent to Pogonomyrmex nests. We also installed pitfall traps to assess the diversity of ant species that may have visited the cafeterias. Our results showed that among offered seeds, 3-99% were collected by granivorous ants, with small seeds and those with no structure the most preferred. Across all cafeterias, we had 11 ant species in our pitfall traps, with over half of those being known seed predators. From our study, we found that seed traits do influence ant seed preference and our results can help inform practices that could aid in keeping seed on the ground and increasing the chance of germination and establishment.

Generation of Potential Sites for Sustainable Water Harvesting Techniques in Oum Zessar Watershed, South East Tunisia	SUSTAINABILITY												Water harvesting techniques (WHTs) are important climate change adaptation measures to better manage rainwater for domestic and agricultural purposes, but which WHT to plan where is subject to sustainability considerations. Moreover, suitability of different WHTs varies from one location to another, depending on physical and socio-economic conditions. This study aimed to identify suitable sites for WHTs taking into account stakeholders' sustainability criteria. In a participatory assessment framework, Geographic Information Systems and the "Simple Multi-Attribute Rating Technique" were combined to generate suitability maps and to guide sustainable WHTs investments. Steps included the calculation of a sustainability index for a set of traditional and newly introduced WHTs from the perspective of two stakeholder groups, farmers and decision-makers, and its integration with layers of biophysical constraints. An application of the framework in the Oum Zessar watershed, southeast Tunisia, shows that traditional techniques are the most suitable and sustainable for farmers and fall within the highly suitable class in 76.4% of the total area, while decision-makers prefer innovative techniques that are highly suitable in 80.4% of the watershed. The framework offers a scalable transparent process for knowledge integration in support of WHT investment decisions that can be adapted to other dryland areas.

The use of repeated digital photography provides an opportunity to conduct long-term monitoring of plant phenology and to extract phenological transition dates. Here, we tracked the phenological changes in the flowering tree, Elaeagnus angustifolia L., in the Cherigele (CRGL) of the Badain Jaran Desert (BJD) and the nearby Lianggejing (LGJ); using one-year near-surface digital repeat photography and meteorological data, the phenological difference between the two sites was revealed. We found that the use of digital cameras allowed for the monitoring of plant phenology with high temporal and spatial accuracy in these dryland ecosystems. Furthermore, in the lake group region of BJD, the onset of greening occurred 23 days earlier, the onset of dormancy began 13 days later and the growing season was 36 days longer, compared to those of the surrounding area. This difference is partly related to the higher altitude in the LGJ; however, it is dominantly related to the warm island effect in the lake group region. This effect resulted in the mean annual temperature in the CRGL being similar to 1.6 degrees C higher than in the LGJ.																			1574-9541	1878-0512				MAY	2020	57								101066	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2020.101066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2020.101066													WOS:000528216500005

Aridity and reduced soil micronutrient availability in global drylands	NATURE SUSTAINABILITY												Drylands cover more than 40% of the terrestrial surface, and their global extent and socioecological importance will increase in the future due to the forecasted increases in aridity driven by climate change. Despite the essential role of metallic micronutrients in life chemistry and ecosystem functioning, it is virtually unknown how their bioavailability changes along aridity gradients at the global scale. Here, we analysed soil total and available copper, iron, manganese and zinc in 143 drylands from all continents, except Antarctica, covering a broad range of aridity and soil conditions. We found that total and available micronutrient concentrations in dryland soils were low compared with averages commonly found in soils of natural and agricultural ecosystems globally. Aridity negatively affected the availability of all micronutrients evaluated, mainly indirectly by increasing soil pH and decreasing soil organic matter. Remarkably, the available Fe:Zn ratio decreased exponentially as the aridity increased, pointing to stoichiometric alterations. Our findings suggest that increased aridity conditions due to climate change will limit the availability of essential micronutrients for organisms, particularly iron and zinc, which together with other adverse effects (for example, reduced water availability) may pose serious threats to key ecological processes and services, such as food production, in drylands worldwide.

Studying the effects of education offered by trained peers of patients will facilitate tailoring the peer-led education programs to the regions' specific needs. Here, we evaluated changes in diabetes-related indicators in Filipino patients who received a peer-led education. We used data on 23 patients (age, 67.83 & PLUSMN; 6.69 years; 82.6% female) who participated in all five surveys performed every 6 months from March 2017 to March 2019. After the second survey until the end of this study, the participants were educated in diabetes self-management by their 13 peers who previously had received the training in diabetes self-management. Participants' knowledge of diabetes and the related 'cause, risk factors, nature of diabetes and complications' subindicator were greater on all surveys after starting the peer-led education compared with those on the second survey (i.e. before starting the education); these values did not differ between the first two surveys. Because increasing patients' knowledge can enhance their ability to self-manage their disease and thus improve their quality of life, strategies to expand patients' knowledge about diabetes should be included when organizing peer-led education in regions with limited medical resources.

Crop simulation models may help explore suitable management systems for increasing crop productivity and economic benefits. The present study calibrated and validated the DSSAT-CERES-Maize model in a four-year field experiment, which coupled four densities from 52,500 to 97,500 plant ha -I- and two cultivars under rainfed conditions. The calibrated CERES-Maize model performed fairly well in simulating the phenological dates, and the average root mean-squared error (RMSE) ranged from 0.7 to 2.8 d for anthesis and 0 to 2.8 d for maturity date. The normalized root mean squared errors (nRMSE) for biomass and grain yield were 17.5% and 12.4%, respectively. The average nRMSE for soil water dynamics in the 0-200 cm soil layers was 15.6% among the different growth stages. The calibrated model was subsequently used to evaluate the soil water regime and crop productivity in response to planting density under 38 years of meteorological data. The results showed that maize water productivity and evapotranspiration (ET) fluctuated with seasonal rainfall, and normal and wet years were significantly higher than dry years. Although ET during the growing season tended to increase with increasing density, the long-term continuous high planting density did not cause excessive soil water consumption. Grain yield and water use efficiency (WUE) tended to exhibit a parabolic relationship with planting density during the long-term simulated seasons between different experimental sites. No significant differences were detected between different cultivars in water productivity under long-term simulation. However, the simulation results suggested that the optimal planting density was often related to variability in climate conditions between sites and years. The scenario simulation results suggest that the optimal density should not exceed 67,500 plant ha(-1) when the annual precipitation is less than 500 mm, but it should not exceed 82,500 plant ha(-1) in areas where the rainfall is greater than 500 mm. Therefore, this study suggests that moderate planting density has the potential to realize sustainable maize development in dryland farming systems on the Loess Plateau and similar areas.					liu, junyang/IXD-1252-2023; liu, jiaming/IWE-3196-2023; wang, yu/IUQ-6654-2023; yuan, liping/JPK-7584-2023; Liu, Yujie/IWU-6535-2023; liu, junyang/IXD-1201-2023	Liu, Yujie/0000-0002-1153-6156; 													0168-1923	1873-2240				JAN 15	2022	312								108740	10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108740	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108740		NOV 2021											WOS:000724336700002

Water availability and nutrient management are two important factors that affect high-yield and high-quality wheat production. The main and interactive effects of nitrogen and potassium fertilizers on quantitative-qualitative properties and drought tolerance of an Iranian rainfed cultivar of wheat, Azar-2, were evaluated. Four rates of nitrogen (N0, N30, N60, and N90 kg/ha), along with four concentrations of potassium (K0, K30, K60, and K90 kg/ha), were applied in rainfed (drought stress) and non-stress conditions. The interactive effect of N x K was significant on nitrogen and protein contents of grains at 5% and 1% probability levels, respectively. Different trends of SSI, STI, K1STI, and K2STI indexes were observed with the interactive levels of nitrogen and potassium. The lowest SSI index (0.67) was observed in N30K30, whereas the highest STI (1.07), K1STI (1.46), and K2STI (1.51) indexes were obtained by N90K60 and N90K90. The obtained results could be useful to increase yield and quality of winter rainfed wheat cultivars under drought stress with cool-rainfed areas. N60K30 and N90K60 can be recommended to increase the grain yield and protein content of rainfed wheat under drought stress and non-stress conditions, respectively.

Methods: An integrated simulation and assessment method based on multi-source data was developed, whereby the direct and indirect impacts of urbanisation and cropland changes on forests and grasslands were assessed.Results: (1) An integrated simulation model of land use and land cover (LULC) based on system dynamics, lo-gistics equations, and cellular automata for simulating changes in spatiotemporal landscape patterns in multiple scenarios was developed. The simulation results indicated that urban land use will increase significantly, cropland and grassland will decrease; in addition, there was a clear trade-off between urban land and ecological land in some regions. (2) Using regression analysis to predict future changes in food production under multiple scenarios, an upward trend in yield per unit area and total grain output was observed. The urban-cropland changes from 2015 to 2050 will have significant indirect impacts on forest and grassland landscapes.Conclusion: The results of the present study provide insights into management and trade-off strategies for regulating the coupling between land use and key ecosystem services.

Quinoa, a resilient crop for agroecological transition, possesses a wide genetic diversity, making it suitable for selecting genotypes that require less N fertilizer. In this study, the growth and physiological characteristics of nine quinoa genotypes were assessed to determine their low-N tolerance using the fuzzy membership function. Based on comprehensive evaluation indices, three genotypes were identified: low-N tolerant (BL22), intermediately tolerant (A29), and sensitive (G68). These genotypes were exposed to varying N concentrations, including normal (4 mM), low (0.8 mM), and deficient N (no N) conditions. The results indicate that low-N conditions altered root phenotype, with reduced biomass, total protein, and chlorophyll content; increased soluble sugar levels; and inhibited N-metabolizing enzymes (nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase, glutamate synthase) and N uptake. Under low-N conditions, the tolerant genotype exhibited higher maximal efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), root vitality, and N content compared to the sensitive genotype. Interestingly, the sensitive genotype displayed elongated and thinner shoots and roots in response to low-N, suggesting that plant height and root length are unreliable indicators of low-N tolerance in quinoa. In contrast, shoot and root dry biomass, Fv/Fm, chlorophyll content, N-metabolizing enzymes, and N content proved to be reliable indicators of low-N tolerance during the early growth stage of quinoa. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of utilizing specific growth and physiological parameters as indicators for screening low-N tolerant quinoa genotypes, thereby reducing dependence on N fertilizers.					deng, yan/JDW-8815-2023; Anwar, Sumera/O-3018-2019	Anwar, Sumera/0000-0001-8224-7370														2073-4395				JUN	2023	13	6							1597	10.3390/agronomy13061597	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13061597													WOS:001016831800001

This is the case for many other tropical watersheds in Java, Indonesia and beyond. This study of the BRB (1) quantifies the land-use changes in the period 1995-2015, (2) determines the patterns of land-use changes during 1995-2015, and (3) identifies the potential drivers of land-use changes during 1995-2015. Findings show that from 1995 to 2015, major transitions from forest to shrubs (218 km(2)), forest to dryland agriculture (512 km(2)), and from agriculture to urban areas (1484 km(2)) were observed in the BRB. Responses from land-user questionnaires suggest that drivers include a wide range of economic, social, technological, and biophysical attributes. An agreement matrix provided insight about consistency and inconsistency in the drivers inferred from the Land Change Modeler and those inferred from questionnaires. Factors that contributed to inconsistencies include the limited representation of local land-use features in the spatial data sets and comprehensiveness of land-user questionnaires. Together the two approaches signify the heterogeneity and scale-dependence of the land-use change process.

The typical Indian mango fruit Mangifera indica L has shown promise in the prevention of diarrhea and its complications. However, there is little information available regarding the characterization of organic compounds, metabolites, small molecules, and phytochemicals derived from Mangifera indica L. (Mango). In this study, we performed a global target profiling investigation of phytochemicals and inhibitors in Mangifera indica L.using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) signals. The glutathione (GSH), trimethylamine-Noxcide (TMAO), and trimethylamine (TMO) are associated with disruptions of oxidative stress metabolisms. Metabolic differences of WL and DL mango were investigated with network analysis for revealing their metabolic discriminations. During plant life, fertilization, and biotic and abiotic stress reflected peculiar metabolomic profiles. The methodology is highly efficient, complex deconvolution, spectral baseline fitting that has transported to pattern recognition analysis. Fifty metabolites were identified and characterized which includes xanthones, phenolic acids, fatty acids, flavonoids, and amino acids. The current study is the first report of metabolites reglation by mango fruits.

Remotely Sensed Phenology Monitoring and Land-cover Classification for the Localization of the Endemic Argan Tree in the Southern-west of Morocco	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY												Argania spinosa also known as the argan tree is an endemic plant of Morocco. Despite having the ability to subsist in extreme drought conditions, it is threatened by soil land clearing, overexploitation, and absence of natural regeneration, causing a worrying decline in both spatial extent and density. The spatial extent of dryland forests is debated, as estimates of forest areas in drylands are uncertain. The present study aims to map and locate the spatial distribution of the argan trees at Smimou community located in Essaouira province, south-eastern Morocco, using satellite images and a double-classification process to overcome separability problems. The work focuses on the characterization and comparison of the unique phenological patterns of argan with the other present land-cover classes. NDVI products were derived from a Sentinel-2 time-series covering one year (2018 to 2019), then ground samples were used to extract phenological profiles at parcel level then at tree level, to feed representative calibration samples to Support Vector Machine classifier. The outcome was integrated with an elevation model in a Decision Tree to reclassify mixed areas. The results indicated an F1-score and an overall accuracy of 91.27% and 92.60% respectively, a promising technique for updating argan extent at national scale.

Species-specific effects of biocrust-forming lichens on soil properties under simulated climate change are driven by functional traits	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												Biocrusts are key drivers of ecosystem functioning in drylands, yet our understanding of how climate change will affect the chemistry of biocrust-forming species and their impacts on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling is still very limited. Using a manipulative experiment conducted with common biocrust-forming lichens with distinct morphology and chemistry (Buellia zoharyi, Diploschistes diacapsis, Psora decipiens and Squamarina lentigera), we evaluated changes in lichen total and isotopic C and N and several soil C and N variables after 50 months of simulated warming and rainfall reduction. Climate change treatments reduced delta C-13 and the C : N ratio in B. zoharyi, and increased delta N-15 in S. lentigera. Lichens had species-specific effects on soil dissolved organic N (DON), NH4+, beta-glucosidase and acid phosphatase activity regardless of climate change treatments, while these treatments changed how lichens affected several soil properties regardless of biocrust species. Changes in thallus delta C-13, N and C : N drove species-specific effects on dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), NH4+, beta-glucosidase and acid phosphatase activity. Our findings indicate that warmer and drier conditions will alter the chemistry of biocrust-forming lichens, affecting soil nutrient cycling, and emphasize their key role as modulators of climate change impacts in dryland soils.

Genome-Wide Identification and Characterization of <i>MYB-CC</i> Gene Factor Family in Sorghum and Their Response to Phosphate Starvation	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY												The MYB-CC gene family is implicated in the response to phosphate deficiency in rice, wheat, and soybean. We aimed to identify the MYB-CC gene family members and predict their function in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench). A systemic genome-wide analysis of the MYB-CC gene family in sorghum was performed. The mRNA expression level of SbMYB-CC genes in root tissue under low phosphate condition was detected by using qRT-PCR. A total of 17 SbMYB-CC genes were identified in the sorghum genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SbMYB-CC proteins could be classified into five groups. Promoter regions in SbMYB-CC genes contained multiple cis-acting elements related to light response, hormone regulation, and stress response. Phylogenetic and collinearity analyses revealed MYB-CC proteins to be conserved among sorghum, rice, and maize; the SbMYB-CC gene family experienced strong purifying selection during evolution. Based on the transcriptome data, results revealed that SbMYB-CC genes presented different expression patterns in each tissue and these genes had obvious spatiotemporal expression characteristics. QRT-PCR assays showed that the expression level of SbMYB-CC1 was significantly increased under low phosphorus stress; the mRNA expression level of SbMYB-CC3, SbMYB-CC4, SbMYB-CC10, SbMYB-CC11, and SbMYB-CC16 were significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Genome-wide identification of the SbMYB-CC genes revealed the characterization and potential biological functions of this gene family in sorghum. This study also provides valuable information for further research on candidate SbMYB-CC genes in response to phosphate deficiency in sorghum.																			1021-4437	1608-3407				DEC	2022	69	6							120	10.1134/S1021443722060152	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1021443722060152													WOS:000885058300001

A proper control of leaf senescence is essential for fitness of annual plants. Although great progress has been made in identifying key genes or proteins controlling leaf senescence in Arabidopsis and several other plants, the relevant genes controlling leaf senescence in oilseed rape (Brassica napus) remain largely elusive. In this study, we found that a Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase, BnaMPK1 from oilseed rape positively modulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) -dependent cell death and jasmonic acid (JA)-induced leaf senescence. The expression of BnaMPK1 dramatically increased in senescing leaves of oilseed rape. Transient expression of BnaMPK1 in Nicotiana benthamiana and rapeseed protoplasts resulted in accumulation of ROS and cell death. Moreover, ectopic expression of BnaMPK1 in Arabidopsis exhibited accelerated JA-induced leaf senescence while atmpk1 mutants showed delayed leaf senescence. Furthermore, the expression of chlorophyll degradation and senescence marker genes Non-Yellowing 1 (NYE1, SGR1), Non-Yellow Coloring 1 (NYC1), Senescence-Associated Gene 29 (SAG29) and two well-known gene mediating JA-induced senescence ORESARA (ORE)1 and ORE9 were induced in BnaMPK1 overexpression lines, whereas most of them were repressed in the atmpk1 mutant. A bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay revealed that BnaMKK3 interacted with BnaMPK1 and, constitutively active BnaMKK3 phosphorylated BnaMPK1 whereas inactive BnaMKK3 can not. Taken together, these results indicate that BnaMPK1 acts as a positive regulator of ROS- and JA-dependent leaf senescence.

Ectomycorrhizal and Dark Septate Fungal Associations of Pinyon Pine Are Differentially Affected by Experimental Drought and Warming	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Changing climates can cause shifts in temperature and precipitation, resulting in warming and drought in some regions. Although each of these factors has been shown to detrimentally affect forest ecosystems worldwide, information on the impacts of the combined effects of warming and drought is lacking. Forest trees rely on mutualistic root-associated fungi that contribute significantly to plant health and protection against climate stresses. We used a six-year, ecosystem-scale temperature and precipitation manipulation experiment targeted to simulate the climate in 2100 in the Southwestern United States to quantify the effects of drought, warming and combined drought and warming on the root colonization (abundance), species composition and diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF), and dark septate fungal endophytes in a widespread woodland tree, pinyon pine (Pinus edulis E.). Our results show that pinyon shoot growth after 6 years of these treatments was reduced more by drought than warming. The combined drought and warming treatment reduced the abundance and diversity of EMF more than either treatment alone. Individual ectomycorrhizal fungal taxa, including the drought tolerant Cenococcum geophilum, were present in all treatments but the combined drought and warming treatment. The combined drought and warming treatment also reduced the abundance of dark septate endophytes (DSE), but did not affect their diversity or species composition. The current year shoot growth of the trees correlated positively with ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity, highlighting the importance of diversity in mutualistic relationships to plant growth. Our results suggest that EMF may be more important than DSE to aboveground growth in P. edulis, but also more susceptible to the negative effects of combined climate stressors.

Linares			Dunes, death, and datasets: Modelling funerary monument construction in remote arid landscapes using spaceborne stereo imagery	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE												The Tabarit-East tumulus field is a large cluster of funerary monuments in the western Tagant (south ern Mauritania), where fieldwork has long been restricted by security and logistical concerns. In this paper, we use photogrammetry derived from very high-resolution satellite stereo imagery to measure the volumetric geometry of these funerary monuments, in order to quantify labour energetics and calorific intake associated with construction efforts. This is the first time such a study has been attempted on archaeological structures of this size (>3.5m in diameter). Our results indicate that while the smaller tumuli could have been constructed by nuclear family members within a very short time span, the largest monuments would have demanded greater coordination, as we estimate them to have required the mobilisation of more than 200 person/days and over a million kilocalories. We contextualised how past communities may have engaged with these monuments through spatial analyses, such as least-cost pathways and viewsheds. This combined approach demonstrates the potential of remote sensing techniques to facilitate a deeper understanding of cultural heritage in dryland ecosystems. Furthermore, we aim to integrate these desk-based approaches with collaborative, community-centred fieldwork as soon as this becomes a viable option for this region of Mauritania.

However, our understanding of how aridity affects the diversity of saxicolous lichens in drylands is still limited. To evaluate the relationship between saxicolous lichen diversity and aridity in a central Mexico dryland, a geographical transect was established of 100 km to build an aridity gradient in the semiarid zone of the State of Queretaro, Mexico, comprising ten sampling sites with a 10 km separation. Species richness, abundance and diversity of soil lichen species were recorded using two sampling methods: the quadrat-intercept and the line-intercept method, to compare their performance in assessing soil lichen diversity in drylands. The number of species and Shannon diversity of saxicolous lichens were higher at intermediate values of the aridity index (AI = 0.10-0.34). Quadrat intercept and point intercept methods gave quite similar results, which means that the selected method does not influence the results in a significant way. This study confirms the role of saxicolous lichens as climate change indicators and reveals the importance of the sampling method selection in the evaluation of different parameters of soil lichen diversity in drylands.																			0031-9457	1851-5657					2022	91	4					827	840		10.32604/phyton.2022.017929	http://dx.doi.org/10.32604/phyton.2022.017929													WOS:000730402400008
J	Dorado, J; Almendros, G				Dorado, Jose; Almendros, Gonzalo			Organo-Mineral Interactions Involved in Herbicide Sorption on Soil Amended with Peats of Different Maturity Degree	AGRONOMY-BASEL												The sorption of three herbicides (alachlor, atrazine and linuron) on samples from six peats of progressive degree of maturity (fibric, hemic or sapric types) and soil samples (dryland agricultural Calcic Luvisol amended with the peats) was determined. The extent of the sorption was examined in terms of peat maturity (up to 220 analytical descriptors of the peat material). In most cases, a sorption enhancement effect was observed in the peat-soil system compared with the sum of the sorption in peat and soil alone, i.e., a positive interaction leading to an increase in soil matrix reactive sites. The analytical characteristics of humic and bitumen peat subfractions were useful in forecasting sorption performance. This was the case for high molecular weight hydrophobic fractions, the extent of the alkyl domain in humic substances and oxygen-containing groups. Correspondence analysis illustrated how different characteristics of the peats played a distinct role in sorption in the herbicide-peat system or in the soil-peat-herbicide system. In the former system, there was a relevant bearing of parameters indicating low peat maturity, whereas in the second the sorption was mainly explained by peat colloidal properties, including the concentration and base saturation of oxygen-containing functional groups.

Herbage accumulation (HA) of perennial ryegrass-white clover pastures sown with a single cultivar representing different functional types of perennial ryegrass was compared with the HA of cultivar mixtures over three years in two contrasting environments (Waikato, dryland; Canterbury, irrigated) under dairy cattle grazing. Functional types were: mid-season flowering diploid, late-season diploid, and late-season tetraploid. Mixture treatments (n = 4 at each site) included all binary combinations plus the three-way combination. Mixture HA and the mean HA of the constituent cultivars did not differ for any of the mixture combinations in either environment, apart from winter in Waikato where the mid-diploid plus tetraploid mix out-yielded the mean of the individual cultivars and tended to increase total annual HA. The total annual HA of the mixtures was between 1.0 and 2.3 t DM/ha/year less than the HA of the highest-yielding individual cultivar included in the mixture in six of the eight mixture-environment combinations. While some benefits of mixtures for controlling grazing outcomes were observed, sowing individual high-performing cultivars is a better overall strategy than mixing cultivars to cover a spectrum of traits.

However, the effects of microplastic residues from traditional and biodegradable plastic films on soil nitrogen (N) transformation and bioavailability are not well understood. Here, the main objectives were to examine the effects of micro-sized residues (diameter <5 mm) of polyethylene (PE) and biodegradable plastic mulch films (PLA) on the soil N in two contrasting soils (clay soil and sandy loam soil) in different temperatures (15 degrees C vs. 25 degrees C). Results showed that the micmplastic presence showed a little effect on soil N transformation and bioavailability at 15 degrees C, but both micmplastics significantly decreased NO3-, mineral N (MN), total dissolved N (TDN), the net cumulative N nitrification (Nn), and the net cumulative N mineralization (Nm) at 25 degrees C, indicating that microplastics decreased soil N bioavailability at elevated temperature. Meanwhile, the microplastics significantly reduced the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of N mineralization. The presence of microplastics changed the composition of soil mineral N with lower relative NO3- and higher NH4+ compared to the control in clay soil. The sandy loam soil was more susceptible to microplastic pollution compared to clay soil in N transformation, due to different textures and biochemistry properties in the two soils, which showed that microplastics have a significant soil heterogeneity-dependent effect on soil N processes. Therefore, the results underline that the effects of microplastic residues on soil N cycling can be partly linked to soil properties, suggesting the urgent need for further studies examining their impacts on soil nutrient cycling in different soil systems.					wang, chen/JED-7289-2023; lin, qing/JED-5250-2023; li, bo/JJC-2664-2023; Wang, lingyu/JLM-2013-2023; wu, yunhui/JGD-6838-2023	lu, jun fei/0000-0002-1729-6624; , Xiang/0000-0001-7879-4937													0301-4797	1095-8630				SEP 1	2022	317								115473	10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115473	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115473		JUN 2022						35751272					WOS:000833531400010

WL1) cultured by different nitrogen nutrients	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY												Microalgae are photosynthetic organisms with potentials in sustainable production of valuable metabolites such as polyunsaturated oil. Low nitrogen cultivation is widely used for induction of microalgal oil production. Previously we found that low inorganic nitrogen (low N, 4.5 mM NaNO3) favored oil production in a dryland-isolated eustigmatophyte microalga Vischeria sp. WL1, relative to the usually used nitrogen level (18 mM NaNO3), while low organic nitrogen (low pepN, 4.5 mM peptone) led to both rapider growth and higher oil yield than low N. Here we analyzed the lipidome profiles of Vischeria sp. WL1 under low N and low pepN conditions. Our results revealed that the lipidome profiles induced by both conditions were apparently different. Overall, low N had a much weaker impact on the lipidome profile than low pepN. Notably, low N uniquely induced a significant increase of phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP), phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate (PIP3), whereas low pepN induced a significant increase of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). In addition, low pepN induced a significant increase of neutral glycerolipids. This research deepens our understanding on the lipid metabolism of Vischeria sp. WL1 under different nitrogen conditions and could also guide oil production strategy in microalgae by adopting suitable nitrogen resources.																			0921-8971	1573-5176				FEB	2023	35	1					91	98		10.1007/s10811-022-02858-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-022-02858-0		NOV 2022											WOS:000879141800001

Reducing the existing yield gaps is a potential strategy to accomplish this goal. The objective of this study was to evaluate yield trends, and gaps at different production levels in Mississippi using data from 2012 to 2021. Production levels considered were Mississippi yield contest (Yc), Mississippi State University hybrid testing trials under irrigation (Yp) and dryland (Yw), and actual yield (Ya) from USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service. Since 2012, Yc, Yp, and Ya are stagnant, and Yw has a nonsignificant positive trend. Averaged over 10 yr, a yield gap of 5.6 Mg ha(-1) between Yc and Ya, 4.1 Mg ha(-1) between Yp and Ya, and 2.0 Mg ha(-1) between Yw and Ya were noted at state level. Existing yield gap underlines current production limitations and necessitates adoption of improved agronomic practices. Core Ideas In the last 10 yr, contest yield, potential yield, and actual yield in Mississippi have been stagnant. State level yield gap ranges between 2.0 to 5.6 Mg ha(-1) at different levels. Washington County showed the lowest (25.9%) and Lee County (48.8%) the highest yield gap in Mississippi.					wu, yi/JEP-1581-2023; LI, XIAO/IQV-9318-2023; Rangappa, Raju Bheemanahalli/AAT-4486-2020; Zhang, Zhentao/JQV-7389-2023; Jiang, Yuan/JED-3759-2023; zhang, xu/JEO-4879-2023; He, Chen/JLM-5059-2023; liang, shuang/JOK-5869-2023; Reed, Vaughn/HGB-3816-2022; JIN, LIYING/JFB-1980-2023; LU, Li/JFJ-9011-2023; Dhillon, Jagmandeep/AAG-8241-2019	Rangappa, Raju Bheemanahalli/0000-0002-9325-4901; Reed, Vaughn/0000-0001-6529-4570; Dhillon, Jagmandeep/0000-0002-6260-5174; Li, Xiaofei/0000-0001-5781-4687														2471-9625					2022	7	2							e20092	10.1002/ael2.20092	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ael2.20092													WOS:000865908100001

Eco-geomorphological connectivity and coupling interactions at hillslope scale in drylands: Concepts and critical examples	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The diagnosis of land degradation requires a deep understanding of ecosystem functioning and evolution. In dryland systems, in particular, research efforts must address the redistribution of scarce resources for vegetation, in a context of high spatial heterogeneity and non-linear response. This fact explains the prevalence of ecohydrological perspectives interested in runoff processes and, the more recent, focused on connectivity as an indicator of system resource optimisation. From a geomorphological perspective and reviewing the concepts of eco-hydro-geomorphological interactions operating in ecosystems, this paper explores the effects of erosion on vegetation configuration through two case studies at different spatio-temporal scales. We focus on the structure function linkage, specifically on how morphological traits relate with different stages in the erosional sequence, both in the abiotic and the biotic domain. Results suggest that vegetation dynamics are affected by structural boundary conditions at both scales, i.e. by surface armouring related with rock fragments at the patch scale, and by the degree of hillslope-channel coupling at the hillslope scale. Our preliminary results can serve as new working hypotheses about the structure-function interplay on hillslopes. All this, taking advantage of the recent technological achievements for acquiring very high-resolution geospatial data that offer new analytical possibilities in a range of scales.

Crews			Political Ecologies of Dynamic Wetlands: Hydrosocial Waterscapes in the Okavango Delta	PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER												Research within geography and related disciplines has directed much attention to the coupled interactions between social and ecological systems. These studies have usefully analyzed the multifaceted, temporal, and scalar dimensions of human-environment interactions and how future environmental change will continue to challenge human resource needs. Political ecology research has also made contributions in this regard, particularly by emphasizing livelihood systems, impacts of conservation and development, agricultural production, and environmental governance. Yet although political ecology research has contributed to socioecological systems scholarship, much of this work has been situated within dryland environments or marine ecosystems that have particular biophysical features. Comparatively, wetland environments that experience dynamic flooding regimes warrant further attention from political ecology. This article engages with the findings from an ongoing research project that is evaluating the impacts of flooding variability for rural livelihoods in the Okavango Delta of Botswana. We outline some of the main findings from this work by concentrating on two themes central to political ecology: access and governance. We conclude by arguing that the Okavango Delta should be understood as a hydrosocial waterscape that encompasses a variety of socioecological relationships within the region, as well as the power relations operating at a variety of scales that both produce and govern them.

Here, a field survey of burnt herbaceous vegetation in semi-arid areas was conducted to determine the response of soil arthropods to fire and their short-term recovery after fire. Overall, the abundance and biomass of soil arthropods was more sensitive to fire than the number of groups. The number of soil arthropod groups, especially the dominant groups (mites and springtails), was not significantly affected by wildfires. At the unburned site, soil arthropod abundance showed significant seasonal shifts that may be related to the vegetation properties, temperature, and precipitation caused by seasonal changes. In contrast, soil arthropods at the burnt sites showed a delayed recovery and had only reached 56%-82%, 17%-54%, and 91%-190% of the biomass in the unburnt forest at the 3, 6, and 9 months after the burning event. Our findings of soil arthropod abundance changes in the present study suggest that fire-induced changes in soil and vegetation properties (e.g., AN, LT, and VC) were crucial factors for the changes in soil arthropod abundance in this semi-arid grassland. We conclude that fire disturbance reduces the seasonal sensitivity of soil arthropods by altering their habitat. This study furthers our understanding of wildfire impact recovery by documenting the short-term temporal dynamics of soil arthropods.

However, its content and molecular composition are strongly influenced by agricultural practices, and the determination of DOC content is cumbersome and expensive. A field experiment with three treatments, including (i) no mulching (CK), (ii) gravel mulching (GM) and (iii) film mulching (FM), was selected to study the content and composition characteristics of DOC under different agricultural practices using ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) technology. The results showed that the GM and FM treatments significantly decreased the DOC contents in topsoil (0-20 cm) by 6.15% and 12.18%, respectively, in comparison with the control. The FM treatment significantly decreased the values of specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)), 260 nm (SUVA(260)) and Chromophoric DOM (CDOM) in each soil layer, indicating the aromaticity, hydrophobicity and CDOM content in the FM treatment were significantly decreased in each soil layer. To establish an accurate model for rapid determination of soil DOC, Spearman correlation analysis was performed on normally and non-normally distributed datasets, and linear regression analysis was utilized for modeling with normalized data. The results of linear regression analysis showed that the regression models established among CDOM/DOC, CDOM, SUVA(254), SUVA(260), and specific UV absorbance at 280 nm (SUVA(280)) had a high degree of fit, with coefficients of determination (R-2) all exceeding 0.95. The model validation results showed that the regression model established between CDOM/DOC and CDOM had the highest accuracy with the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) (3.58 mg kg(-1)) and the lowest relative error (RE) (2.74%), which was DOC = 58.065 + 184.355 x A(355) mg kg(-1). The results showed that the estimation of soil DOC can be achieved with good prediction using UV-Vis technology. This study highlights the potential of UV-Vis spectroscopic technology to rapidly estimate soil DOM in agriculture.

Putative candidate genes involved in carotenoid metabolism and regulation were identified, which provide a basis for gene cloning and development of nutrient-enriched wheat varieties through molecular breeding. Lutein, known as 'the eye vitamin', is an important component of wheat nutritional and end-use quality. However, the genetic manipulation of grain lutein content (LUC) in common wheat has not previously been well studied. Here, quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with the LUC measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were first identified by integrating a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and linkage mapping. A Chinese wheat mini-core collection (MCC) of 262 accessions and a doubled haploid (DH) population derived from Jinchun 7 and L1219 were genotyped using the 90K SNP array. A total of 124 significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) on all 21 wheat chromosomes except for 1A, 4D, and 5B that formed 58 QTL were detected. Among them, six stable QTL were identified on chromosomes 2AL, 2DS, 3BL, 3DL, 7AL, and 7BS. Meanwhile, three of the ten QTL identified in the DH population, QLuc.5A.1 and QLuc.5A.2 on chromosome 5AL and QLuc.6A.2 on 6AS, were stable and independently explained 5.58-10.86% of the phenotypic variation. The QLuc.6A.2 region colocalized with two MTAs identified by GWAS. Moreover, 71 carotenoid metabolism-related candidate genes were identified, and the allelic effects were analyzed in the MCC panel based on the 90K array. Results revealed that the genes CYP97A3 (Chr. 6B) and CCD1 (Chr. 5A) were significantly associated with LUC. Additionally, the gene PSY3 (QLuc.5A.1) and several candidate genes involved in the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathways colocalized with stable QTL regions. The present study provides potential targets for future functional gene exploration and molecular breeding in common wheat.					zhang, xiao yu/JMA-9767-2023	Zheng, Xingwei/0000-0001-8351-2658													0040-5752	1432-2242				SEP	2022	135	9					3127	3141		10.1007/s00122-022-04175-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-022-04175-z		AUG 2022						35951035					WOS:000839423400001

Indigenous microbial communities play an important role on Se geochemistry in soils. In this study, the microbial community composition and functions of 53 soil samples were investigated using high-throughput sequencing. Samples were divided into 3 groups with different farming types based on the measured geochemical parameters and microbial functional structures. Results indicated that putative Se related bacteria Bacillus, Dyella, Paenibacillus, Burkholderia and Brevibacillus were dominant in dryland plantation soils which were characterized with higher available Se and low contents of H 2 O, total organic carbon (TOC), NH 4 + and NO 2 -. In contrast, the putative denitrifier Pseudomonas dominated in flooded paddy soils with higher TOC, NO 3 - and organic Se, whereas genera Rhizobium, Nitrosospira , and Geobacter preferred woodland soils with higher oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), pH, NH 4 + and Fe. Farming patterns resulted in distinct geochemical parameters including moisture, pH, ORP, TOC, and contents of soluble Fe, NO 2 - and NH 4 + , shaping the microbial communities, which in turn affected Se forms in soils. This study provides a valuable insight into understanding of Se biogeochemistry in soils and prospective strategy for Se-rich agriculture production.

J	Amiraslani, F; Dragovich, D				Amiraslani, Farshad; Dragovich, Deirdre			Iran's Regional Transnational Water Partnerships: Unclear Rules, Unstable Partnerships, and an Unsettled Future	SUSTAINABILITY												Water resources are the most contentious, scarce, and contestable natural resources at any geographical scale. Where water resources cross international boundaries, additional uncertainties arise for access to and distribution of available water. Here, we examined three transnational water partnerships by focusing on Iran as a dryland country with a developing economy. Thus, Iran has a key interest in water policies and the development and governance of water resources. Within Iran's regional context, we considered whether the country obtained a geopolitical advantage from three regional water partnerships, involving the Caspian Sea, the Helmand River, and the export of hydroelectricity. We used a global database and several years of Iranian newspaper articles to explore possible linkages between contemporary and historical challenges while looking at international laws and conventions. We highlighted (a) the transboundary Helmand River as the most unstable partnership; (b) the complexities of the relationships between the Caspian Sea's beneficiaries, including Iran, in utilising its vast resources in an environment with unclear rules; and (c) the rainfall- and geopolitically dependent hydroelectricity exchange agreements with neighbouring countries. Although Iran pursued such international involvement through treaties and economic initiatives, its water-based geopolitical influence in the region remains constrained by domestic demand, hydrometeorological geography, and the involvement of major world powers.																				2071-1050				AUG	2023	15	15							11889	10.3390/su151511889	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su151511889													WOS:001045820200001
J	Li, SP; Sawada, Y				Li, Shuping; Sawada, Yohei			Soil moisture-vegetation interaction from near-global <i>in-situ</i> soil moisture measurements	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Although the interactions between soil moisture (SM) and vegetation dynamics have been extensively investigated, most of previous findings are derived from satellite-observed and/or model-simulated SM data, which inevitably include multiple sources of error. With the effort of many field workers and researchers in in-situ SM measurement and SM data integration, it is now possible to obtain the integrated in-situ SM dataset in the global range. Here we used the in-situ SM dataset of the International Soil Moisture Network to analyze the anomaly correlation between SM and leaf area index (LAI). We found that positive (negative) correlations exist between SM (LAI) and temporally lagged LAI (SM). The peak correlation and lagging time to reach it (often less than 3 months) depends on climate, land cover and rooting depths. The high SM-LAI anomaly correlation prevails in water-limited regions, e.g. dryland, where plant physiology has strong sensitivity to subsurface water stress. Dynamics of vegetation with deeper maximum rooting depths are not always correlated with SM in deeper soil layers, and vegetation dynamics with shallower maximum rooting depth may strongly correlate with SM in deeper soil layers. Overall, we highlight the potential of the global in-situ SM observation network to analyze the interactions between SM and vegetation dynamics.

J	Brockman, HG; Brennan, RF; van Burgel, A				Brockman, Henry G.; Brennan, Ross F.; van Burgel, Andrew			The impact of phytohormone concentration in <i>Moringa oleifera</i> leaf extract on wheat yield and components of yield	JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION												Trials with Moringa oleifera leaf extract (MLE) sprayed on leaves of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) showed different outcomes in grain yield and the components of yield (biomass at anthesis, number of ears, number of tillers, grain weight, 1000 seed weight). An irrigated field trial testing different MLE concentrations resulted in an increase in grain yield of 19% with a 10% concentration but not significant yield increases for higher concentrations of MLE. Dryland field trials with MLE concentrations at 5% and 10% showed no effects or more moderate (about 5-10%) increases in grain yield, depending on the year and location of study. The differences in grain yield responses are most likely due to changes in phytohormone concentration in MLEs brought on by abiotic stress (moisture deficit and seasonal change) of the moringa tree before the collection of the leaves. Concentrations of gibberellins, auxin, abscisic acid, salicylic acid, and jasmonic acid in MLEs differ markedly due to plants subjected to abiotic stresses. Comparing chemical analysis of MLE with grain yield effects showed that GA4 - most likely in crosstalk with auxin - is the major growth enhancer. It is concluded that the hormonal concentrations of MLEs strongly varies on a yearly basis, which may affect the potential use of this bio-stimulant in agriculture.																			0190-4167	1532-4087				FEB 7	2020	43	3					396	406		10.1080/01904167.2019.1683195	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2019.1683195		NOV 2019											WOS:000495255000001

Here, we report on sediment records of eolian and fluvial interactions since the last glacial period, in the semiarid area of northwest China, at the limit of the Southeast Asian monsoon. Sediment sequences of last glacial and Holocene terraces of the Yellow River are composed of channel gravels, overlain by flood sands, eolian dunes, and flood loams. These sequences, dated by optically stimulated luminescence, record interlinks between fluvial and eolian processes and their response to climate change. Sedimentologic structures and grain-size analysis show flood loams, consisting of windblown sediment, deposited from floodwater suspended sediment. The gravel and sand were deposited during cold periods. During transitions from cold to warm phases, the river incised, and dunes were formed by deflation of channel and floodplain deposits (>70 and 21-16 ka). Dunes also formed at similar to 0.8 ka, probably after human intervention. After dune formation, flood loam covered dunes without erosion during peak discharges at the beginning of the subsequent warm period. The fluctuations of the Southeast Asian monsoon as a moisture-transporting agent have perhaps been the driving force for interactions between fluvial and eolian processes in this semiarid environment.					wang, xianyan/ABO-8369-2022; Vandenberghe, Jef/H-5846-2019	wang, xianyan/0000-0002-8281-5734; Vandenberghe, Jef/0000-0001-9910-1319													0033-5894	1096-0287				MAR	2019	91	2					570	583		10.1017/qua.2018.22	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/qua.2018.22													WOS:000464585000008

Determining the age of this activity has previously yielded controversial results. Our magnetostratigraphic and OSL dating results suggest the two artifact-bearing paleosols are correlated with MIS 5 and 7, respectively. Correlating paleoclimatic data with marine delta O-18 records leads us to conclude that two sandy gravel layers containing many artifacts in the lower part of the Dayao sequence were formed during MIS 9 and 11, if not earlier. Our results reveal that the earliest human occupation at the Dayao site occurred before ca. 400 ka during a relatively warm and moist interglacial period, similar to several subsequent occupations, documenting the earliest and northernmost archaeological assemblage yet reported in China's arid northwest. We conclude that the northward and southward displacements of the East Asian summer monsoon rain belt during past interglacial-glacial cycles were responsible for the discontinuous human occupation detected at the Dayao site. The penetration of this precipitation regime into dryland ecologies via the Huanghe (Yellow River) Valley effectively created a corridor for hominin migration into China's arid northwest.					jiang, lei/IWE-1124-2023; GE, Junyi/GRX-5741-2022; Li, Qin/ABC-7311-2021; Deng, Chenglong/B-8871-2009; Olsen, John W./AAB-6653-2022	Li, Qin/0000-0002-6971-2052; Olsen, John W./0000-0001-5295-7451													0033-5894	1096-0287				SEP	2021	103						113	129	PII S0033589420001155	10.1017/qua.2020.115	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/qua.2020.115													WOS:000701182800011

A consultant-run semiochemical-based integrated pest management programme was implemented in 1982 against these beetles, following fulfilment of four prerequisites: (1) presence of receptive potential clients, (2) availability of semiochemical lures, (3) invention of an operational trap, and (4) proof of concept of mass trapping technology. The programme is based on two broad strategies: maintain the problem at a tolerable level and, if necessary, reduce the problem to a tolerable level. One measure of effectiveness over 12 years of mass trapping at a dryland sort near Sooke, on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, was 16.4 million beetles trapped and an estimated five to one benefit-to-cost ratio. Despite success, several factors have conspired to reduce the programme from 50 sites serviced in early years to 7 in 2018. Timber companies in British Columbia are currently showing renewed interest and are taking steps to incorporate the integrated pest management programme as a formal component of their overall operations.																			0008-347X	1918-3240				FEB	2021	153	1			SI		79	90	PII S0008347X20000474	10.4039/tce.2020.47	http://dx.doi.org/10.4039/tce.2020.47													WOS:000605622500007

Supplemental irrigation alleviates the adverse effects of soil moisture stress on yield during drought periods. To determine the influence of irrigation timing on yield stability, a 3-yr, on-farm irrigation experiment was conducted to determine the effects of supplemental irrigation on rapeseed yield and yield components in a semi-arid environment. The field experiment considered the influence of six irrigation quantities applied at three growth stages (vegetative, flowering, and early ripening) on rapeseed yield and quality. Supplemental irrigation improved rapeseed yield compared with cultivation under rainfed conditions throughout the three experimental years. Although the greatest seasonal evapotranspiration and rapeseed yields were observed with full irrigation, the highest economic rate and most efficient irrigation rate were for the optimum level to be applied at flowering. Protein content, oil content, and fatty acids increased with irrigation and were highest for the full-irrigation treatment. Irrigation should be applied when 50% of available soil moisture has been consumed in the effective root zone at the early flowering stage. This timing enhances the water use efficiency and yield potential of rapeseed without reducing quality and could be highly beneficial for semi-arid regions.

Most fog-vegetation studies focus on individual plant scale; the relationship between fog and vegetation function at larger spatial scales remains unclear. This hinders an accurate prediction of climate change impacts on dryland ecosystems. To this end, we examined the effect of fog on vegetation utilizing both optical and microwave remote sensing-derived vegetation proxies and fog observations from two locations at Gobabeb and Marble Koppie within the fog-dominated zone of the Namib Desert. Significantly positive relationships were found between fog and vegetation attributes from optical data at both locations. The positive relationship was also observed for microwave data at Gobabeb. Fog can explain about 10%-30% of variability in vegetation proxies. These findings suggested that fog impacts on vegetation can be quantitatively evaluated from space using remote sensing data, opening a new window for research on fog-vegetation interactions. Plain Language Summary This study presents the first observed relationships between fog and vegetation function using satellite remote sensing data. Significant correlations were found between fog and satellite-derived vegetation indices at two study sites within the Namib Desert. These findings suggested that satellite data can be used to assess and quantify the impacts of fog on vegetation at large spatial scales.

Remote Sensing indicators and vertebrate biodiversity distribution in global drylands: An assessment with ESA Diversity II products	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Remotely sensed estimates represent relevant tools for assessing biodiversity distribution, yet their relationships with functional groups across drylands have never been evaluated. We assessed relationship between bio-indicators derived by the ESA Diversity II project and distribution of terrestrial vertebrates in five drylands. Twenty seven bio-indicators were derived from MERIS data, including averages and inter-annual variability of seasonally aggregated proxies for net primary production, rainfall, soil moisture, rain use efficiency, and soil moisture use efficiency. For each dryland, the functional strategy of 739 terrestrial vertebrates was summarized into functional groups and predicted functional species richness was related with bio-indicators. Water availability was better related with functional species richness than net primary production estimates, suggesting water availability as a critical aspect shaping vertebrate distribution in drylands. Body size appeared as an important functional trait influencing vertebrate distribution across drylands, especially in small-sized species associated with water availability. Selected functional traits, quality of species presence data, and ecological modelling approaches affected analyses relating bio-indicators to vertebrate distribution. The 27 bio-indicators showed potential for biodiversity distribution assessments, and may be taken into consideration in future studies with appropriate model adaptations. The followed methodological approach could be applied to other drylands and even other ecosystems.

J	Tao, HY; Pan, WL; Carter, P; Wang, K				Tao, Haiying; Pan, William L.; Carter, Paul; Wang, Ku			Addition of lignin to lime materials for expedited pH increase and improved vertical mobility of lime in no-till soils	SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT												Soil acidification caused by long-term nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications has been a growing concern for dryland crop production in both tilled and no-till soils in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). Many no-till soils have stratified soil pH in the 5-10 cm depth due to repeated N fertilizer applications at this depth. In the PNW, the practice of liming to correct low soil pH is complicated due to lack of affordable lime sources and because the inherent difficulty in ameliorating stratified soil acidity in no-till systems. An intact soil-column incubation study was conducted to investigate whether mixing lime materials with lignin-containing black liquor-a by-product from the pulp industry-could elevate soil pH change in both conventional and no-till systems and expedite vertical downward movement of lime in no-till system. Results indicate that mixing lime with black liquor has the potential to not only elevate the increase in soil pH in both conventional till and no-till systems, but also accelerate downward movement of lime to correct soil pH below the soil surface. Mixing agricultural lime or super fine micro lime with black liquor increased soil pH to a depth of 25-30 cm within 147 days after surface application to a no-till soil.

Spatio-temporal supply-demand of surface water for agroforestry planning in saline landscape of the lower Amudarya Basin	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Global warming is predicted to increase water scarcity in many drylands worldwide. In Central Asia, one of the most intensively irrigated dryland agricultural regions, climate change is likely to exacerbate the regional water supply-demand gaps, particularly in downstream areas. The withdrawal of degraded, highly salinized croplands from irrigated farming in favor of tree plantations that effectively utilize saline groundwater may contribute to irrigation water saving, which can generate valuable ecosystem services and provide rural income opportunities. To facilitate the spatial planning of afforestation in the lower Amudarya region, we developed a hydrological algorithm to map the spatio-temporal pattern of water supply-demand. The resulting map, based on seven-year continuous data of cropping pattern and corresponding irrigation dynamics, rainfall, and evapotranspiration at 250 m resolution, revealed the overly irrigated areas from which excess water can be redistributed to water stressed areas. Furthermore, combining this information with spatial data on marginally productive croplands and with water requirement of tree plantations showed that 67% of these croplands are characterized by water availability sufficient for the introduction of salt-tolerant tree species. The algorithm developed is of potential use for defining the feasibility of introducing alternative (tree) crops with known growth and water use characteristics.

Combining resilience and resistance with threat-based approaches for prioritizing management actions in sagebrush ecosystems	CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE												The sagebrush biome is a dryland region in the western United States experiencing rapid transformations to novel ecological states. Threat-based approaches for managing anthropogenic and ecosystem threats have recently become prominent, but successfully mitigating threats depends on the ecological resilience of ecosystems. We used a spatially explicit approach for prioritizing management actions that combined a threat-based model with models of resilience to disturbance and resistance to annual grass invasion. The threat-based model assessed geographic patterns in sagebrush ecological integrity (SEI) to identify core sagebrush, growth opportunity, and other rangeland areas. The resilience and resistance model identified ecologically relevant climate and soil water availability indicators from process-based ecohydrological models. The SEI areas and resilience and resistance indicators were consistent-the resilience and resistance indicators showed generally positive relationships with the SEI areas. They also were complementary-SEI areas provided information on intact sagebrush areas and threats, while resilience and resistance provided information on responses to disturbances and management actions. The SEI index and resilience and resistance indicators provide the basis for prioritizing conservation and restoration actions and determining appropriate strategies. The difficulty and time required to conserve or restore SEI areas increase as threats increases and resilience and resistance decrease.

Rhizosphere Soils in the Figuig Oasis (Southeastern Morocco)	JOURNAL OF FUNGI												Date palm, an important crop in Morocco and many other arid regions around the world, faces significant challenges from wind, water shortages, and salinization, which contribute to vegetation loss and soil degradation in the harsh environmental conditions of oasis ecosystems with low soil fertility. Protecting and regenerating these degraded lands is crucial for sustainable agriculture and improving the dryland ecosystem. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) comprise a vital element in this dynamic within the microflora of the soil rhizosphere. This study evaluated the potential in mycorrhizal soil and identified AMF in date palm rhizospheres in eight locations within the Figuig oasis (southeastern Morocco). This study found that Extension and Zenaga had more mycorrhizal propagules than other locations. Replanted maize (Zea mays L.) in these soils exhibited higher mycorrhization rates (91-93%) compared to that in other locations, with the Lamaiz site registering the lowest rate (39%). The phosphorus content was negatively correlated with the AMF spore frequency, intensity, and density, while a positive correlation was detected between the soil pH and the AMF spore frequency and density. The morphological identification of spores revealed Glomus as the predominant species, along with Acaulospora and Sclerocystis. This study represents an initial step toward the potential application of these fungi in environmental conservation and sustainable agriculture in arid regions.

Changes in water fluxes partition related to the replacement of native dry forests by crops in the Dry Chaco	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Land-use change has been the strongest driver of vegetation cover change in the world. In the South American Dry Chaco (similar to 1 M km(2); PPT/ET0 < 0.65), native dry forests are experiencing high deforestation rates that tend to continue in the coming years. Here, we used a hydrological model (Hydrus 1-D) to analyze changes in the water balance triggered by the replacement of dry forests by annual rainfed summer crops. We found that transpiration represented the main water vapour flux in both vegetation covers (59 and 48% of annual rainfall in dry forest and cropland, respectively), followed by evaporation (31 and 30%, respectively) and interception (11 and 9%, respectively). Runoff was five times higher in the cropland compared to the dry forest (10 vs. 2%; p < 0.01). Deep drainage was a negligible water flux in dry forests but it represented 4% of annual rainfall in croplands (p < 0.01), reaching values of zero and 130 mm year(-1) for dry and wet years, respectively. Our results highlight the key role of vegetation cover controlling ecosystem water fluxes in the Dry Chaco. More generally, we suggest that the expansion of dryland cultivation can modify the regional water balance and threaten the primary production of ecosystems in the long run.

To solve this issue, this study retrieved 15-m multiscale urban lands. Results indicated that urban area increased by 68% during 2000-2018, and one-third of the increase was contributed by only three large cities. The coverage of impervious surface area (ISA) and vegetated area (VA) increased by 16.6% and 1.38%, respectively. Such land-cover change may be helpful in suppressing wind erosion and sand storms. We also found that the newly urban lands had relatively lower ISA and higher VA than the old urban lands, indicating an improved human settlement environment. Strong environmental constraints on urban expansion were identified, with cities in oasis urban environments (OUEs) that had water supply expanding 150% faster than cities in desert urban environments (DUEs). Urban development was also constrained by terrain, with 73% of the ISA expansion occurring in relatively flat areas. Overall, the aggregated pattern of urbanization and the increase in ISA and VA in the newly urbanized lands have improved water-use efficiency and ecological services and benefited desert ecosystem protection in arid/semiarid China.																			1009-637X	1861-9568				JUL	2023	33	7					1419	1441		10.1007/s11442-023-2136-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11442-023-2136-4													WOS:001076750300004
J	Noth, N; Köthe, T				Noth, Niklas; Koethe, Thomas			A Mathematical Model for the Take-Off in Platform Diving	JOURNAL OF HUMAN KINETICS												In platform diving the take-off phase is of outstanding importance in order to achieve both a high level of performing quality and a high degree of difficulty. The diver has to produce the right forces and direction of the center of mass (COM) in order to attain the required angular momentum and dive height. To support the development of an optimum take-off technique, the Institute for Applied Training Science designed a dryland measuring and feedback system. Using the example of the dive back 11/4 somersault tucked in preparation for the dive back 31/2 somersault tucked (207 C) from the 10-m-platform, kinematic and kinetic reference values for key positions were determined. Therefore, we developed a mathematical model using a multi-step examination plan with the following parts: (1) variables defined using nonparametric correlation analyses rs of the motion parameters, (2) statistical modelling to predict values of the parameters, (3) stochastic modelling. The model is based on a selection of 18 dives from 10 different elite divers of the German Swimming Federation (DSV). The approach presented provides helpful insights into the mechanisms of an optimal take-off enables a target-performance comparison with objective motion parameters and therefore, enables individualized feedback to guide the training process more efficiently.																			1640-5544	1899-7562				OCT	2021	80	1					29	37		10.2478/hukin-2021-0097	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/hukin-2021-0097								34868414					WOS:000721170900004

Here we assess the determinants of grassland greenness on the Mongolian Plateau, one of the world's largest grassland biomes, which covers Mongolia and the province of Inner Mongolia in China. We use spatial panel regressions to quantify the impact of precipitation, temperature, radiation, and the intensity of livestock grazing on the normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) during the growing seasons from 1982 to 2015 at the county level. The results suggest that the Mongolian Plateau experienced vegetation greening from 1982 to 2015. Precipitation and animal density were the most influential factors contributing to higher NDVI on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia and Mongolia. Our results highlight the dominant effect of climate variability, and especially of the precipitation variability, on the grassland greenness in Mongolian drylands. The findings challenge the common belief that higher grazing pressure is the key driver for land degradation. The analysis exemplifies how representative wall-to-wall results for large areas can be attained from exploring space-time data and adds empirical insights to the puzzling relationship between grazing intensity and vegetation growth in dryland areas.

ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE												A supervised feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) trained with backpropagation algorithms, along with multiple linear regression (MLR) model, was applied to predict the biological yield (BY) of grass pea. For this purpose, a four-year study (2008-2012) was carried out under rainfed conditions in three dryland stations in Iran, and a panel of 12 grass pea genotypes were evaluated for agronomic and phonologic characters. Stepwise regression (SWR) and principal component analysis (PCA) were employed to evaluate 15 input parameters. To discover the optimum ANN structure, different training algorithms, transfer functions, number of hidden layers and neuron in each layer were studied and optimized using Taguchi's method. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) model with tangent sigmoid (tagsig) transfer function, Levenberg-Marquardt learning algorithm, and two hidden layers was identified as the best model to predict the BY of the grass pea. The sensitivity analysis of inputs revealed that seed yield (SY) followed by thousand seed weight (TSW) and number of days to maturity (NDM), respectively, were the most influential factors in predicting BY in both models. According to the adjusted ANN model, early flowering genotypes with long maturity and high TSW should be considered as the best model for enhancing BY in breeding programs.																			0365-0340	1476-3567				DEC 5	2020	66	14					1909	1924		10.1080/03650340.2019.1701189	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2019.1701189		DEC 2019											WOS:000502183600001
J	Yang, X; Shao, MA; Li, TC				Yang, Xi; Shao, Ming'an; Li, Tongchuan			Effects of terrestrial isopods on soil nutrients during litter decomposition	GEODERMA												Soil fauna are important biological factors that affect litter decomposition and play an important role in the release of nutrients, such as carbon and nitrogen. This study focused on the role of soil fauna in litter decomposition. Field microcosm experiments were conducted to assess the influence of isopods (Porcellionidae and Armadillidiidae) on soil nutrients during the litter decomposition of Catalpa bungei (CL), Platanus acerifolia (PL), and Aesculus chinensis (AL). The litter mass loss and nutrients in different soil layers treated with various isopods were determined in three-month microcosm incubations. Results showed that the presence of isopods significantly increased (P < 0.05) the litter decomposition rates compared with the control treatment (CK). The average weight (2.56 g) and total weight ratio (85.47%) of the isopod-decomposed litter were much larger than those of the CK treatment (0.43 g and 14.31%, respectively). In the different litter types collected, CL showed the highest decomposition rate among the different isopod treatments. Isopods increased the contents of organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), total potassium (TP), Olsen phosphorus (OP), available potassium (AK), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) in the surface soil by 59.19%, 27.36%, 2.72%, 29.30%, 5.85%, 13.10%, and 14.60%, respectively, relative to CK. The profile distribution of soil nutrients and the soil quality index under different isopod treatments were significantly (P < 0.05) greater in the 0-1 cm soil layer than in the 1-2, 2-4, and 4-6 cm soil layers. Further analysis showed that this significance was affected by decomposition time, isopod species, soil depth, and the interactions of these factors. The findings demonstrate that the isopods could accelerate litter decomposition and improve soil nutrients. This work provides evidence demonstrating that soil fauna can improve surface soil quality by promoting litter decomposition.																			0016-7061	1872-6259				OCT 15	2020	376								114546	10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114546	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114546													WOS:000558138300022

Control of AB requires integrating pest management options including resistant cultivars and fungicide applications. To address this, fungicides with different modes of action were evaluated on three chickpea cultivars with differing levels of susceptibility to AB under irrigated and dryland conditions in 2015 to 2017. The fungicides were applied once or twice and compared with a no-fungicide application control on AB score and yield. The mean grain yields across locations and years were 1,753, 1,283, and 981 kg/ha, with a corresponding AB mean score of 2.6, 3.2, and 3.3 on 0 to 7 scale (where 0 is no disease and 7 is completely dead) for the moderately resistant, moderately susceptible, and susceptible chickpea cultivars, respectively. Fungicide application was not enough to control disease throughout the season. The use of AB-resistant cultivars had the most significant impact on minimizing the disease and maximizing yield, irrespective of year and location. This study supports previous research indicating that planting AB-resistant chickpea cultivars is essential for disease control, regardless of the fungicides applied.																			0191-2917	1943-7692				JAN	2022	106	1					247	253		10.1094/PDIS-06-21-1252-RE	http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-06-21-1252-RE								34524870					WOS:000769542600031

Armario			Land, water and energy: The crossing of governance	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The paper focusses on the impact on dryland ecosystems of conflicting governance in the regulations of land use, water for irrigation and electric energy from photovoltaic installations (PV). The research uses the empirical results of a panel data model based on long time series that enable sensitivity of the main crops to energy cost and the viability of the solar panel system connected to the grid to be identified. We present evidence of the private and social benefits of investments in PV to improve the gross margin of farmers and decrease the carbon footprint of the irrigated areas. Relevant regional disparities in the sensitivity of the main crops explain the regional competition for low-cost water resources and the social conflicts associated with water governance. The Feed-In Tariff system for a PV system is evaluated as a tool to reach clean energy targets and preserve the populations working and living in irrigated drylands. An evaluation of the water desalination plants based on PV is analysed as an alternative to balance the hydric resources of intensive irrigated systems. The main conclusion is that coordinated regulation in energy and water policies may improve farmers' profitability and accelerate the speed in reaching environmental targets in drylands.																			0140-1963	1095-922X				APR	2021	187								104403	10.1016/j.jaridenv.2020.104403	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2020.104403		JAN 2021											WOS:000617998900001

However, success has been seriously limited due to lack of thorough characterization of the impact of the diversity of farm household types on productivity, resource-use efficiency and economic and nutritional status. This study applied hierarchical ascendant classification to a random sample of 286 cereal-producing farm households in Morocco and identified distinct household typologies. It also carried out an analysis of trade-offs between economic, nutritional and environmental factors induced by the production decisions of the different farm household typologies. Our analysis identified three dominant farm household typologies in the production system, namely: (i) intensive predominantly-vegetable farming households with high input intensities, (ii) semi-intensive cereal mono-crop farming households with moderate input intensities and (iii) extensive mixed cereal-legume farming households with low input intensities. Extensive mixed cereal-legume farming households exhibited the highest resource-use efficiency and high biodiversity. These benefits, however, came at the expense of a much lower farm income and limited food supplies relative to the other two systems. These results show that, as is the case for many dryland regions, all three farm types showed precarious conditions for one or more of the sustainability-related indicators.

Even though the amount of solar radiation decreases with the depth of the water, water provides sustainable cooling and cleaning for solar PV cells underwater. There are many challenges and constraints to develop solar PV cells underwater because they are mostly calibrated and amenable to space, dryland, terrestrial, etc., and the solar spectrum is prone to get narrower with the depth of the water. The implementation of solar PV cells underwater is pliable in various commercial and defense applications, such as sensors, water monitoring systems, autonomous vehicles, underwater gliders, etc. In this article, first, a mathematical model has been developed for the solar cell spectrum to incorporate the changes in the solar irradiance with the depth of the water. Furthermore, an experimental setup was designed and implemented to mimic an underwater environment. The performance of the polycrystalline encapsulated solar cell was studied based on the different types of water and the depth of the solar cell underwater. This article manifests that there is a sufficient amount of underwater solar power that can be utilized using PV cells to operate various devices and systems.

However, the hatching dynamics of zooplankton dormant stages may vary across climate zones, and the knowledge of temporal hatching patterns of wetland zooplankton is incipient for tropical drylands in South America. With an ex-situ experiment, we assessed the temporal patterns in community structure of zooplankton hatchlings in the sediment of intermittent wetlands of the Brazilian tropical semiarid. Hatchlings were collected every two days in the laboratory over a 28-day hydration period. Hatchling abundance and richness peaked on the middle-to-late phase (third and fourth weeks), and composition showed a weekly variation over the hydration period. While large Branchiopoda and Moina sp. (Cladocera) predominated in the early phase (until the second week), most taxa of Ostracoda, Rotifera and Cladocera predominated in the middle-to-late phase of the experiment (third and fourth weeks after hydration). We found that the hatching patterns of zooplankton dormant stages in intermittent wetlands from the Brazilian semiarid convey marked short-term dynamics after hydration cues. This is useful to understand the zooplankton egg-bank hatching dynamics in tropical-dryland wetlands, which are expected to be under strong hydric stress in the future.

The objectives of this study were (1) to build a BEM for Prosopis pallida in order to estimate the AGB and tree biomass by fraction; and (2) to analyze the differences among the BEMs for the datasets of four priority Prosopis species (P. pallida, P. laevigata, P. glandulosa, and P. juliflora) so as to fit them into a single common model. This was done using both univariate and multivariate generalized linear models and five databases obtained from literature. Our results showed that the univariate and multivariate models had a high R-2 and were able to predict AGB. Tree biomass by fraction was successfully modeled using both BD and tree height. The databases regarding natural and planted Prosopis forests were statistically different, signifying that they fit into two different equations.

PHYSICAL THERAPY IN SPORT												Objective: The purpose of this study is to identify the training load (TL) monitoring practices employed in real-world competitive swimming environments. The study explores data collection, analysis and barriers to TL monitoring. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Online survey platform. Participants: Thirty-one responders working in competitive swimming programmes. Main outcome measures: Methods of data collection, analysis, level of effectiveness and barriers associated with TL monitoring. Results: 84% of responders acknowledged using TL monitoring, with 81% of responders using a combination of both internal and external TL, in line with current consensus statements. Swim volume (mileage) (96%) and session rate of perceived exertion (sRPE) (92%) were the most frequently used, with athlete lifestyle/wellness monitoring also featuring prominently. Thematic analysis highlighted that "stakeholder engagement", "resource constraints" or "functionality and usability of the systems" were shared barriers to TL monitoring amongst responders. Conclusions: Findings show there is a research-practice gap. Future approaches to TL monitoring in competitive swimming should focus on selecting methods that allow the same TL monitoring system to be used across the whole programme, (pool-based training, dryland training and competition). Barriers associated with athlete adherence and coach/National Governing Body engagement should be addressed before a TL system implementation. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Data were collected in 154 plots at five different sites. The prevalence index method was used to categorise the species into wetland and non-wetland indicators. Log series and Hill number models were applied to quantify community assemblages, whereas the CCA technique was used to examine the relationship between anthropogenic activities and species presence or absence. In all, 2 185 individuals, belonging to 32 families and 68 species were recorded. Paspalum orbiculare and Persicaria lanigera were the most abundant, indicating their wide distribution. Mean number of individuals were highest at Atafua and lowest at Owabi. An abundance of terrestrial species (41.2%; i.e. plant species not listed as obligate wetland plants) and facultative species (30.9%), compared with obligate wetland species (27.9%), suggests a dominance of species from dryland habitats into the wetland. Farming activities, increased levels of NH4+, PO43+ and NO3-N, were the predictors that explained 72.01% of the overall variability in community assemblages. The results revealed the impact of the anthropogenic activities on the ecological integrity of the Owabi Ramsar Wetland and the need to institute conservation measures outlined in this study.

To understand the spatial heterogeneity of soil biotic and abiotic resources as a result of fertile islands in deserts, soil bacterial and physicochemical profiles were measured at four soil depths (0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-40 cm, and 40-60 cm) in three soil patches (under mid-canopies, at the edge of canopy cover, and in bare soil) around legumes (Hedysarum scoparium shrubs) and non-legumes (Artemisia ordosica shrubs). Unexpectedly, the patches of the two plants showed similar soil abiotic and biotic patterns. Copiotrophs and potential decomposers were enriched under mid-canopies, with more phylogenetically clustered bacterial communities, and co-occurrence networks with lower connectivity and higher modularity than in bare soil. In bare soil, oligotrophs and potential nitrate reducers were enriched. Soil properties showed less conspicuous spatial heterogeneity than bacterial communities. The only soil physicochemical properties enriched under mid-canopies were soil organic matter, dissolved organic carbon, and nitrate; their enrichment was significantly related to bacterial communities. This study elucidates the spatial patterns of soil properties and their relationships, which are observed in fertile islands of desert ecosystems, and provides further insights into the mechanisms of soil nutrient redistribution.					zhou, yang/JED-3951-2023														0341-8162	1872-6887				NOV	2021	206								105526	10.1016/j.catena.2021.105526	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.105526		JUN 2021											WOS:000688449100035

Impact of Land Use Land Cover (LULC) Change on Surface Runoff in an Increasingly Urbanized Tropical Watershed	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Upper-Brantas watershed in East Java, Indonesia, is a tropical watershed experiencing rapid landscape change, a phenomenon typical to developing countries. This study demonstrates the impact of Land Use Land Cover (LULC) changes on surface runoff in a tropical, urbanized, and data scarce watershed. The LULC changes were quantified between 1995 and 2015 and their impact on the hydrological processes was analyzed using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. During the study period, the watershed experienced an increase in settlement and dryland agriculture, and a decrease in the forest, rice field, and sugarcane plantation. The SWAT model results for the calibration (2003-2008) and validation (2009-2013) periods matched observed values [R-2>0.91 and NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency) >0.91]. In the long-term, the model predicted changes in runoff (+8%), water yield (+0.28%), groundwater (-1.8%), and evapotranspiration (-1.15%) due to changes in LULC. LULC changes showed a linear relationship with runoff generation, and the most significant factors affecting surface runoff were changes in the forest, agriculture, and settlements. Increasing urbanization, industrialization, and agricultural intensification will increase runoff which in turn will enhance the flow of nutrients and sediments into the water bodies.					astuti, ike/GNP-8398-2022; Mishra, Deepak R/Q-1250-2018	astuti, ike/0000-0002-6455-3697; Mishra, Deepak R/0000-0001-8192-7681; Milewski, Adam/0000-0003-0494-8002													0920-4741	1573-1650				SEP	2019	33	12					4087	4103		10.1007/s11269-019-02320-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-019-02320-w													WOS:000504320400003

Krishna			Water deficit and heat stress induced alterations in grain physico-chemical characteristics and micronutrient composition in field grown grain sorghum	JOURNAL OF CEREAL SCIENCE												The surge in sorghum-based foods as a gluten-free alternative for cereals like wheat, has directed sorghum research towards understanding and improving grain quality parameters. Since sorghum is usually grown in arid and semi-arid environments, is often prone to terminal water deficit and heat stress, inducing significant yield and quality losses. In environment 1, 24 genotypes assembled from diverse geographic locations, representing major sorghum growing regions of the world were grown in irrigated and dryland conditions. In environment 2, heat stress was imposed on the same 24 genotypes by placing custom-built field-based heat tents on already established plants, starting from booting until maturity. Water-deficit stress increased kernel hardness and total protein in grain, decreased protein digestibility, and micronutrient composition. Heat stress recorded lower total protein, protein digestibility, micronutrient composition and higher kernel hardness than control. irrespective of the stress, larger kernels recorded higher total protein, protein digestibility and micronutrient composition, but lower total starch and kernel hardness. Almost all the measured grain micronutrients (Zn, Fe, Mn and Cu) were reduced under both stresses compared to control. Genotypes such as SC372 and RTx7000 which maintained desired grain quality parameters under stress conditions can help in incorporating quality traits into sorghum improvement programs.

For this purpose we analysed barley, winter wheat, soybean, corn and cotton. Drought was quantified by means of the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The results demonstrate a strong response in the interannual variability of crop yields to the drought time-scales in the different cultivations. Moreover, the response is highly spatially variable. Crop types showed considerable differences in the month in which their yields are most strongly linked to drought conditions. Some crops (e.g. winter wheat) responded to drought at medium to long SPEI time-scales, while other crops (e.g. soybean and corn) responded to short or long drought time-scales. The study confirms that the differences in the patterns of crop yield response to drought time-scales are mostly controlled by average climate conditions, in general, and water availability (precipitation), in particular. Generally, we found that there is a weaker link between crop yield and drought severity in humid environments and also that the response tends to occur over longer time-scales.

J	Wang, H; Zhang, QW; Wang, J				Wang, Hao; Zhang, Qing-wei; Wang, Jian			Spatial variation in soil water on a hillslope with ephemeral gullies restored by different vegetation restoration modes on the Loess Plateau	CATENA												Vegetation restoration in an ephemeral gully (EG) can alter the traits of soil, vegetation, and microtopography, and therefore likely influences soil water. Nevertheless, few results have been reported regarding the response of soil water regime to vegetation restoration modes in EGs in semiarid region. This research was designed to clarify the spatial variation in soil water in an EG with different restoration modes on the Loess Plateau of China. For the selected EG, the two banks of ephemeral gully were well restored by natural succession and artificial planting. Soil water content (Og) was quantified on the ephemeral gully floor (F), natural successional restored ephemeral gully top (NT), and artificial planted restored ephemeral gully top (AT) in both the vertical and longitudinal directions. A sloping farmland was selected as the control. The results revealed that Og increased significantly with soil depth (i.e., 0-1 m) and the distance from the ephemeral gully head (i.e., 0-60 m). In the vertical di-rection, the mean Og of the six test points of the ephemeral gully floor was 1.1 to 1.2 times greater than that of the control in each soil layer, while the mean Og of the six test points of NT and AT decreased by 12.3 % to 15.6 % and 29.2 % to 29.9 % compared to the control in each soil layer. Along the longitudinal direction, the Og (i.e., 0-1 m soil layer) abided by the pattern of F > NT > AT. The difference in Og between the three ephemeral gully units and their variations in the vertical and longitudinal directions were mainly driven by the variations in soil clay content, bulk density, organic matter content, plant root density, plant litter density, and the distance from the ephemeral gully head. The findings are useful to clarify the spatial variation in soil water and to select a reasonable vegetation restoration mode on hillslopes in semiarid regions.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				MAY 1	2023	224								107001	10.1016/j.catena.2023.107001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.107001		FEB 2023											WOS:000933949400001

This study coupled the PLUS and InVEST models to analyze the influence of various factors on LULC, and then obtain the influence of these changes on HQ from 2000 to 2020. Based on this analysis, that scenario has been simulated for 2040: the arable land protection scenario (APS) and the natural increase scenario (NIS). The results showed that: (1) LULC between 2000-2020 was dominated by arable and garden land. (2) HQ improved steadily, particularly between 2011-2020. The main natural factors influencing HQ were elevation and distance to water, whereas the important anthropogenic factors were GDP and distance to secondary roads. (3) The simulated HQ indices of APS and NIS in 2040 were 0.501 and 0.525; the largest differences were in forestland and dryland. The urban expansion area in the APS was 1.62 km(2) less than NIS. These results indicate the need for government to adopt reasonable approaches to managing areas of different HQ.																			1230-1485	2083-5906					2023	32	5					4593	4605		10.15244/pjoes/168106	http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/168106													WOS:001086532000011
J	Eigentler, L				Eigentler, L.			Intraspecific competition in models for vegetation patterns: Decrease in resilience to aridity and facilitation of species coexistence	ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY												Patterned vegetation is a characteristic feature of many dryland ecosystems. While plant densities on the ecosystem-wide scale are typically low, a spatial self-organisation principle leads to the occurrence of alternating patches of high biomass and patches of bare soil. Nevertheless, intraspecific competition dynamics other than competition for water over long spatial scales are commonly ignored in mathematical models for vegetation patterns. In this paper, I address the impact of local intraspecific competition on a modelling framework for banded vegetation patterns. Firstly, I show that in the context of a single-species model, neglecting local intraspecific competition leads to an overestimation of a patterned ecosystem's resilience to increases in aridity. Secondly, in the context of a multispecies model, I argue that local intraspecific competition is a key element in the successful capture of species coexistence in model solutions representing a vegetation pattern. For both models, a detailed bifurcation analysis is presented to analyse the onset, existence and stability of patterns. Besides the strengths of local intraspecific competition, also the difference between two species has a significant impact on the bifurcation structure, providing crucial insights into the complex ecosystem dynamics. Predictions on future ecosystem dynamics presented in this paper, especially on pattern onset and pattern stability, can aid the development of conservation programs.

To identify the possible mechanism for such variation, we modeled the Late Cretaceous climate using a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM), Community Earth System Model version 1.2 (CESM1.2), under different CO2 concentrations and orbital configurations. The simulation results show that the mid- to low-latitude Asia was generally dry during that time, consistent with reconstructions. The arid area decreases and the semi-arid area increases with the increase of CO2 concentration, but the change in total area is small even when CO2 is increased by 8 folds. In contrast, the area of dryland can increase by similar to 67% or 500% depending on how dryness is defined, when the orbital configuration changes from one in which the northern hemispheric summer receives the most solar insolation to one in which it receives the least solar insolation. Therefore, the mid- to low-latitude Asia was likely going through dramatic dry-humid cycles at orbital timescale during the Late Cretaceous, similar to the Saharan region during the Late Miocene-Pleistocene.

Alluvial aquifer recharge results from rare surface water flows. Assessment of surface flow frequency using traditional methods (rain or flow gauges) requires a high-density monitoring network, which is rarely available. This study aimed to determine if satellite optical imagery could detect infrequent surface flows to estimate recharge frequency. Well-used sensors (Landsat and MOMS) have insufficiently high spatio-temporal resolution to detect often short-lived flows in narrow sand rivers characteristic of drylands. Therefore, Sentinel-2 offering 10 m spatial resolution was used for the Shingwidzi River, Limpopo, South Africa. Based on an increase of Normalised Difference Water Index relative to the dry season reference value, detection of surface flows proved feasible with overall accuracy of 91.2% calculated against flow gauge records. The methodology was subsequently tested in the ungauged Molototsi River where flows were monitored by local observers with overall accuracy of 100%. High spatial and temporal resolution allowed for successful detection of surface water, even when flow had receded substantially and when the rivers were partially obstructed by clouds. The presented methodology can supplement monitoring networks where sparse rainfall or flow records exist.

Responses of biological soil crusts to rehabilitation strategies	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are common to dryland ecosystems and can influence a broad suite of soil ecological functions including stability and surface hydrology. Due to long recovery times following disturbance, there is a clear need for rehabilitation strategies to enhance the recovery of biocrust communities. Essential to biocrust recovery are exopolysaccharides (EPS): secretions comprised mainly of high molecular weight polymers that protect cyanobacteria and other biocrust organisms from harsh environmental conditions. We examined whether biocrust rehabilitation strategies (combinations of inoculation with surface shading and artificial soil stabilization) promote EPS production. To test if responses varied by soil texture, we measured biocrust recovery on two fine-textured soils (clay and sandy clay loam) in a cool desert ecosystem. Shade coupled with inoculum addition resulted in the highest biocrust recovery, especially on clay soils. Independent of rehabilitation strategies, natural recovery of biocrusts occurred more rapidly on clay soils, reflected by greater increases in chlorophyll a (chl a). Chl a, a proxy for cyanobacterial biomass, was correlated to EPS amounts, suggesting that cyanobacteria are significant contributors to EPS production in biocrust development. Despite the role of EPS in biocrust establishment, EPS amounts had negligible effects on soil stability on the fine soil texture.

Time-series satellite earth observation datasets were used to investigate spatiotemporal patterns of the vegetation greenness changes in the region and then a principal component regression method was applied to identify the region-wide spatial pattern of driving factors. Results find that vegetation greening is widespread in the region, while vegetation browning is more clustered in central West Africa. The dominant drivers of vegetation greenness have a distinct spatial pattern. Climatic factors are the primary drivers, but the impacts of precipitation decrease from north to south, while the impacts of temperature are contrariwise. Coupled with climatic drivers, land cover changes lead to greening trends in the arid zone, especially in the western Sahelian belt. However, the cluster of browning trends in central West Africa can primarily be attributed to the human-induced land cover changes, including an increasing fractional abundance of agriculture. The results highlight the spatial pattern of climatic and anthropic factors driving vegetation greenness changes, which helps natural resources sustainable use and mitigation of climate change and human activities in global dryland ecosystems.

However, outbreaks of seed rot and damping-off of metalaxyl-treated chickpea seeds were found in the dryland agriculture regions of southeastern Washington and northern Idaho. Pythium spp. isolated from rotten seeds and associated soils showed high levels of resistance to metalaxyl. Large proportions (31 to 91%) of Pythium isolates resistant to metalaxyl were detected in areas where severe chickpea damping-off occurred and were observed in commercial chickpea fields over several years. All metalaxyl-resistant (MR) isolates were identified as Pythium ultimum var. ultimum. The metalaxyl resistance trait measured by EC50 values was stable over 10 generations in the absence of metalaxyl, and no observable fitness costs were associated with metalaxyl resistance. Under controlled conditions, metalaxyl treatments failed to protect chickpea seeds from seed rot and dampingoff after inoculation with MR Pythium isolates. In culture, ethaboxam inhibited mycelial growth of both MR and metalaxyl-sensitive isolates. Greenhouse and field tests showed that ethaboxam is effective in managing MR Pythium. Ethaboxam in combination with metalaxyl is commonly applied as seed treatments in commercial chickpea production.

Knowledge of within-species genetic diversity and adaptive responses, especially along climatic gradients, becomes critical to inform management, conservation and restoration efforts. We combine the analysis of neutral (microsatellites) and adaptive divergence (morphological traits in common garden experiments) between populations along a sharp precipitation gradient in the native Patagonian grass Festuca pallescens, to disentangle patterns of local adaptation and genetic diversity. The identification of genetically based traits under divergent selection denoted the existence of local adaptation in spite of extensive gene flow. Two plant growth patterns were detected associated with two ecological regions. In arid environments, a trade-off between not resigning foliage production, and reducing the exposure to drying agents resulted in a compacted plant architecture; while in dry subhumid environments, populations exhibited a wide architecture to cope with rainfall and radiation interception. Increasing aridity and grazing might favor a compact plant architecture, and fragmentation might reduce genetic diversity across these environments. Being a widely distributed species, F. pallescens is an excellent model species to study adaptive responses across environmental gradients facing climate change predictions, especially in dryland rangelands that maintain multiple ecosystem functions.

Desiccation tolerance allows organisms to survive in a nearly completely dehydrated, dormant state. At the cellular level, sugars and proteins stabilize cellular components and protect them from oxidative damage. However, there are few studies of the dynamics and drivers of whole-plant recovery in vascular DT plants. In vascular DT plants, whole-plant desiccation recovery (resurrection) depends not only on cellular rehydration, but also on the recovery of organs with unequal access to water. In this study, in situ natural and artificial irrigation experiments revealed the dynamics of desiccation recovery in two DT fern species. Organ-specific irrigation experiments revealed that the entire plant resurrected when water was supplied to roots, but leaf hydration alone (foliar water uptake) was insufficient to rehydrate the stele and roots. In both species, pressure applied to petioles of excised desiccated fronds resurrected distal leaf tissue, while capillarity alone was insufficient to resurrect distal pinnules. Upon rehydration, sucrose levels in the rhizome and stele dropped dramatically as starch levels rose, consistent with the role of accumulated sucrose as a desiccation protectant. These findings provide insight into traits that facilitate desiccation recovery in dryland ferns associated with chaparral vegetation of southern California.

In this study, a state-of-the-art approach for assessing the intensity of LD and DS processes using remote-sensing-derived indicators within a GIS environment was proposed. The analysis was carried out using the Principal Component Analysis based on integrating the significant trends of relevant biophysical parameters in Romania. The methodology was tested and validated at the national level in Romania. In total, 7.76% of the area was identified as LD and 60.8% of the total area tended to improve, and 31.44% was stable. Most of the regions with LD overlapped with the dryland areas, while improvement areas were identified outside of the drylands. In forested areas from high altitudes, a tendency to improve the condition of vegetation was observed, and most of the surfaces being protected were natural areas that have benefited from proper management. All these results can be used to adapt management practices to avoid, reduce, or restore the LD. The proposed model was based on globally available remote sensing datasets, with a high frequency of data acquisition and collection history that allows for the statistical analyses of changes on a global scale.

Social and financial drivers of conservation adoption, however have buffered implementation. An integrated systems understanding is needed to identify internal feedbacks and potential synergistic conservation policies. We simulate the physical, social, and financial incentive interactions with a high-level system dynamics model to understand the conservation adoption and subsequent erosion behavior of the system. A Bass diffusion model integrated with physical modeling results enables the simulation of CSA, the diffusion of innovations, and payment for conservation practices. Land retirement and tillage reduction best management practices are assessed for the dryland wheat farming region in the Inland Pacific Northwest of the United States. Model utility was confirmed with quantitative land management data and qualitative local expertise. Historical, voluntary-based efforts to reduce erosion suffer marginal returns. We conclude that: (1) All targeting of CSA reduces long-term erosion rates; (2) The most effective use of conservation funds, however, occurs when the diffusion of innovation mechanism is reinforced by broad-scale payments for tillage reduction; and (3) By identifying and utilizing positive feedback, our simulations suggest large gains in erosion reduction and conservation fund efficiency are possible.																			1093-474X	1752-1688				DEC	2022	58	6					1341	1357		10.1111/1752-1688.13034	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.13034		JUN 2022											WOS:000810795100001

To date, there is still limited information on how biocrust development influences the succession of diazotrophic community, and what are the most important factors mediating diazotrophic communities during biocrust succession. Using the high throughput nifH amplicon sequencing, the diazotrophs in soils at different developmental stages of biocrust were comparatively studied. The results evidenced the decreases of TOC/TN ratio and pH value with biocrust development. Nostoc and Scytonema were the most dominant diazotrophic genera at all biocrust stages, while Azospirillum and Bradyrhizobium were abundant only in bare soil. Diazotrophic co-occurrence networks tended to be less complex and less connected with biocrust succession. The soil TOC/TN ratio was the most dominant factor mediating diazotrophic diversity, community composition and assembly processes, while diazotrophic-diversity and NO3--N/NH4+-N ratio were positively correlated with the nitrogenase activity during biocrust succession. This study provided novel understandings of nitrogen fixation and succession patterns of diazotrophic community, by showing the effects of biocrust succession on diazotrophic diversity, community composition, community assembly and co-occurrence networks, and recognizing TOC/TN ratio as the most dominant factor mediating diazotrophs during biocrust succession.

Maize nutrient yield response and requirement in the maize belt of Nigeria	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Absence of site-specific nutrient recommendation and high spatial variability of soil fertility are major factors affecting maize response to applied nutrients in Nigeria. In this study, we assessed maize response to applied nutrients and nutrient use efficiency in different management zones (MZs), for designing site-specific nutrient management recommendations for maize in the maize belt of Nigeria. The maize belt in Nigeria was earlier delineated into four MZsMZs (MZ1 to MZ4) based on soil properties. In the current study, data from two different trials, nutrient omission trials (N = 293) and fertilizer response trial (N = 705), conducted in the years 2015-2017, were extracted for MZ1 to MZ3; to analyze maize yield responses to application of N, P and K, and secondary and micro-nutrients. Maize yield response to K application was only positive in MZ1. Responses to N and P application were positive for all MZs. However, the magnitude of maize response to P varied between the MZs, indicating a differentiation in the degree to which P is limiting maize production in the study area. Average nitrogen requirement was higher for MZ3 (138 kg ha(-1)), than for MZ2 and MZ1 (121 and 83 kg ha(-1), respectively). Average P requirement was higher for MZ3 (45 kg ha(-1)) than for the other zones. Potassium requirement was 26% and 28% higher in MZ2 and MZ3 compared with MZ1 (similar to 15 kg ha(-1)). The use of the specific nutrient rates for the MZs may reduce risks and uncertainties in crop production. The delineated MZs of the maize belt of Nigeria that incorporates spatial variability in soil fertility conditions are useful for nutrient management for larger areas.

J	Siman-Tov, S; Marra, F				Siman-Tov, Shalev; Marra, Francesco			Antecedent rainfall as a critical factor for the triggering of debris flows in arid regions	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												In arid regions, debris flows (DFs) are occasionally observed when heavy rainfall hits steep slopes with unconsolidated materials. Despite the related hazards, not much is yet known about the critical rainfall conditions for DF initiation in dryland areas mainly due to a lack of observations and data. In this study, we use high-resolution digital surface models and orthophotos to detect DFs on the arid slopes of the Dead Sea's northwestern margins, as well as weather radar rainfall estimates for the characterization of the triggering and non-triggering storms. We identify deposits from over 40 relatively small DFs that occurred between 2013 and 2019. We divide them into four groups based on their spatial distribution and triggering period, and we identify the most likely triggering storms based on weather radar data and additional information. We show that the DFs were likely triggered by an intense convective cell (lasting less than 45 min) which was preceded by non-negligible rainfall amounts (about 10 mm) delivered during the storm. Comparing triggering and non-triggering storms, we observed that rain intensity alone is insufficient to explain the phenomena and discuss the possibility that antecedent rainfall could represent a critical factor for the triggering of DFs on steep slopes of arid environments.

Natural distribution and phenotypic traits of <i>Neltuma flexuosa</i> var. <i>depressa,</i> a candidate taxon for the rehabilitation in the central arid region of Argentina	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Dryland rehabilitation in the central arid region of Argentina is urgently needed to reverse the current high levels of degradation. Neltuma flexuosa var. depressa, adapted to arid environments, gives it the potential to be used in rehabilitation, for extensive livestock grazing and apiculture. When the soil seed bank is exhausted and natural regeneration is impossible, seed-based rehabilitation programmes constitute one of the more promising options. Thornless ecotype selection could improve pods utilization, so studies of the population distribution can be useful as a genetic resource for pre-breeding. Niche occupancy exhibits a large latitudinal extension (32-43 degrees S), mainly in areas of salinity. All populations would have a transient soil seed bank, but seed dormancy release was lower in populations originating in more unpredictable environments, which distributes germination across years and acts as a bet-hedging strategy between seasons. We observed differences between the populations, with greater spinescence being associated with higher isothermality and lower annual precipitation (r > 80***) at the population's place of origin, showing local adaptation. We also found some thornless seedlings (1.67%) in a population with lower spinescence. However, the plastic response of thorns in seedlings, as well as later stages, should be evaluated in stressful environments.

However, few economic estimates exist of their value as pest control agents in many high value crops. We calculated the economic benefit of direct predation of insect pests by bats and the damage averted to cotton yield, a high value commodity crop in Australia. Using a combination of bat dietary studies, average daily energy requirements (estimated by field metabolic rate), prey energy content and acoustic data of bat feeding attempts in cotton crops, we show the direct value of insectivorous bats to the Australian cotton industry is likely between $99-126 ha-1 in dryland Bt-cotton and $286-361 ha-1 in irrigated Bt-cotton through the consumption of pest moth Helicoverpa armigera, amounting to $63.6 million annually. We estimate that a population of bats can remove between 77-119 t of moths from Australian cotton crops in an average year across the growing season. However, different bat species consume different insect pests, highlighting the need to conserve bat diversity in agroecosystems. These results provide further incentive for growers to manage non-crop bat roosting habitat to benefit from natural pest control in crops.

And yet, it cannot fix dinitrogen, essential in often nitrogen-limited drylands. But a diazotroph-rich "cyanosphere" has been described inM. vaginatus, hinting that there exists a C for N exchange between the photoautotroph and heterotrophic diazotrophs. We provide evidence for this by establishing such a symbiosis in culture and by showing that it is selective and dependent on nitrogen availability. In natural populations, provision of nitrogen resulted in loss of diazotrophs from the cyanosphere ofM. vaginatuscompared to controls, but provision of phosphorus did not. Co-culturing of pedigreed cyanosphere diazotroph isolates with axenicM. vaginatusresulted in copious growth in C and N-free medium, but co-culture with non-cyanosphere diazotrophs or other heterotrophs did not. Unexpectedly, bundle formation inM. vaginatus, diacritical to the genus but not seen in axenic culture, was restored in vitro by imposed nitrogen limitation or, even more strongly, by co-culture with diazotrophic partners, implicating this trait in the symbiosis. Our findings provide direct evidence for a symbiotic relationship betweenM. vaginatusand its cyanosphere and help explain how it can be a global pioneer in spite of its genetic shortcomings.

Microorganisms are the main biological factor for oil removal in the environment but microbial remediation is greatly affected by environmental factors. For our research, we inoculated three species of bacterivorous nematodes into oil-contaminated soil to explore how bacterivorous nematodes affect soil microbial activities and community structure in contaminated soil, as well as how efficiently different nematodes remove oil pollution from the soil. Six treatments were set in this experiment: sterilized oil-contaminated soil (SOC); nematode-free soil (5); oil-contaminated soil (OC); oil-contaminated soil + Caenorhabditis elegans (OCN1); oil-contaminated soil + Cephalobus persegnis (OCN2); oil-contaminated soil + Rhabditis marina (OCN3) for a 168-day incubation experiment. After the experiment was done, the oil contents in SOC, OC, OCN1, OCN2, and OCN3 were reduced by 6.5%, 32.3%, 38.2%, 42.8%, and 40.2%, respectively, compared with the beginning of the experiment. The amount of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) of Gram-negative bacteria in OC, OCN1, OCN2, and OCN3 was increased by 50.9%, 43.4%, 37.7%, and 47.9%, respectively, compared with that of S. During the 168-day incubation period, the maximum growth of the number of nematodes in OCN1, OCN2, and OCN3 compared with the initial number of the nematodes were 2.25-, 1.52-, and 1.65-fold, respectively. The amount of oil residue in the contaminated soil negatively correlated with the populations of nematodes, total microorganisms, Gramnegative bacteria, actinomycetes, and eukaryotes. Thus, oil pollution increased the number of Gram-negative bacteria, decreased the ratio of Gram-positive bacteria/Gram-negative bacteria and Fungi/Bacteria significantly, and altered the community structure of soil microorganisms. Each species of bacterivorous nematodes has got its unique effect on the microbial activity and community structure in oil contaminated soils, but those tested can promote oil degradation and thus improve the environment of oil contaminated soils.

Measurement at discrete points in the field is now common using multi -depth sensors reporting at high temporal resolution, e.g.; every 15 or 60 min. The agricultural industry standard for data representation is suitable for prescriptive applications such as irrigation scheduling but is inadequate for descriptive applications such as reviewing change through a rainfed growing season. We developed an inter-active interface for animating past data and tested it on 61 EnviroPro (R) capacitance probes for up to 24 months starting mid 2019. Probes were installed in grey vertisol cropping soils of northern NSW, Australia, which contract when dry to produce deep cracks. When static, the interface highlights change in moisture at each level to the present date, with a default value of seven days. The interface shows these values against historical ex-tremes for the installation duration. When animated, the interface enables exploration of soil moisture change over one or more seasons by depth and crop phenology. We believe this descriptive use of data improves un-derstanding of crop-water relations, particularly for dryland crop production systems where management de-cisions are reliant on longer-term projections.

Spatial structure of the Caatinga woody flora: abundance patterns have environmental, Pleistocene, and indigenous drivers	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS												Despite growing knowledge on the distribution and functioning of dryland vegetation types, their internal biodiversity structure (i.e., subregions) is much less studied. In the delineation of subregions, the use of species occurrence or abundance data may reveal different aspects of metacommunity structure. We revisit the issue of the bioregionalization of the woody flora of the Caatinga, the largest block of the dry forest and woodland biome in Latin America, using abundance data. We also evaluated the drivers of the spatial distribution of plant subregions: historical, current environmental and human effects. Using a K-means partition on interpolated NMDS axes, we identified 10 abundance subregions. Aridity, topography and soil, biome stability since the Pleistocene, and historical indigenous effects were retained by a Multinomial Logistic regression model, and their combined fractions explained most of the abundance variability in subregions. The subregions we present may support spatialized conservation and management decisions in the lack of detailed local data. The present results confirm the Caatinga woody flora broad composition patterns uncovered using presence-absence data in previous studies. Additionally, we found larger subregions than those identified with presence and absence data, suggesting the existence of oligarchies of dominant species in distinct parts of the Caatinga biome.

Sediment grain size distribution, geometric mean diameter, mean weight diameter, labile SOC, CO2 flux, and C mineralization ratio were measured. The finest sediments were observed on the dune edge. The labile SOC and CO2 flux rate showed an increasing trend in the edge, windward, and top positions. However, the C mineralization ratio decreased only in the dune edge. A significant increase of clay fractions at the dune edge can result from the horizontal sediment transport by runoff from the interdune area to the dune. The SOC could bond with clay fractions to contribute toward the formation of soil aggregation, causing less vulnerability of SOC to microbial respiration. A significant increase of sand fractions, transported by the aeolian process, on the top and windward positions could not protect SOC against decomposition. The interactions among hydro-aeolian processes and micro-geomorphology could encourage the hot spots of sediment carbon reservoirs within the dryland landforms that have a significant proportion in the exchange of carbon to the atmosphere.

Genotype x environment interaction and stability of β-glucan content in barley in the Palouse region of eastern Washington	CROP SCIENCE												Genotype by environment (G x E) interactions for the dietary fiber beta -glucan, one of the deciding factors for the end use of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) grain, are not well understood. The objectives of this study were (a) to investigate G x E interactions for beta -glucan content of diverse barley genotypes across dryland grain-producing environments in eastern Washington, and (b) to determine the range and stability of beta -glucan content exhibited across precipitation zones. We examined 17 two-row, spring barley varieties and breeding lines across eight locations for beta -glucan, protein, and yield in 2017 and 2018. beta -glucan ranged from 1.81 to 7.18 (%, w/w), with a mean of 4.01 (%, w/w). Genotype x year (Y), G x location (L), L x Y, and G x E (G x L x Y) interactions were found for beta -glucan. Univariate models including the regression model with slope (b(i)) and deviation from regression (Sd2), Wricke's ecovalence stability index (Wi2), and Shukla's stability variance (sigma i2) agreed that there was moderate rank stability amongst genotypes. Data generated through this research will provide a better understanding of which cultivars that farmers can grow in their area will meet industry targets and standards for both food and malt barley.																			0011-183X	1435-0653				SEP-OCT	2020	60	5					2500	2510		10.1002/csc2.20181	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/csc2.20181													WOS:000615985900024

Nationwide crop yield estimation based on photosynthesis and meteorological stress indices	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												There is considerable demand for nationwide grain yield estimation during the cropping season by growers, grain marketers, grain handlers, agricultural businesses, and market brokers. In this paper, we developed a semi-empirical model (Crop-SI) to estimate the yield of the three major crops in the dryland Australian wheatbelt by combining a radiation use efficiency approach with meteorology driven Stress Indices (SI) at critical crop growth stages (e.g., anthesis and grain filling). These crop-specific SI (e.g., drought, heat and cold stress) help explain the impact of high spatial agro-environmental heterogeneity, which lead to substantial improvement in grain yield prediction. Crop-SI explains 87%, 69% and 83% of the observed field-scale grain yield variability with root mean square error of similar to 0.4, 0.4 and 0.5 t/ha for canola, wheat, and barley, respectively. At the pixel-level, Crop-SI reduces the relative error in grain yield estimation to 34%, 25%, and 20% for canola, wheat, barley, respectively, compared to two benchmark models. By incorporating water- and temperature-driven stresses, Crop-SI's predictive skill in highly variable environments is enhanced. As such, it paves the way for the next generation of agricultural systems models, knowledge products and decision support tools that need to operate at various scales.

Our study patterns in the phytoplankton community structure of freshwater rock pools in dryland ecosystems of northeast Brazil. We hypothesized that depending on the degree of isolation between rock pools, functional groups would be better indicators of the isolation gradients than would species, with a decrease in the similarity between communities with increasing distance. We sampled 20 rock pools across a region with rainfall < 300 mm/yr (Paraiba, Brazil), and identified 55 taxa in 13 functional groups. Cyanobacteria dominated in 10 of the 20 rock pools, which were shallow (<= 1.5 m) and slightly acidic to alkaline (pH 5.8-10.3). The Jaccard similarity index showed no correlation with the distance between rock pools, suggesting that isolation did not influence the species composition, although a highly stochastic distribution was observed. A synergy among local structuring factors (size, depth, light limitation) and spatial (dispersal) factors appears to best explain distribution and structure of the phytoplankton communities in these freshwater rock pools.

Carbon isotope discrimination association with yield and test weight in Pacific Northwest-adapted spring and winter wheat	AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES & ENVIRONMENT												Due to considerable influence of environment on yield, breeding for drought tolerance could benefit from focusing on selection of more heritable physiological traits, such as carbon isotope discrimination (as measured by delta, increment ) for indirectly assessing water use efficiency (WUE) of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Spring and winter wheat cultivars were assayed for increment , and these values were used to determine the relationships with performance in over 13 environments in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. The correlation coefficients of increment values between the wheat cultivars grown in different environments ranged from 0.11 to 0.73 for both spring and winter wheat. There was significant genotypic variation for increment in soft spring and hard winter wheat but not in hard spring and soft winter wheat. The increment values were poor indicators of yield for this set of wheat cultivars in most environments, although low values (better WUE) were sometimes correlated with yield. A population of 165 hard spring wheat recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between two hard spring wheat varieties that differed in increment was also screened in low-rainfall dryland and irrigated environments. High yields in this recombinant inbred population were weakly correlated with high increment values or low WUE in most environments.

Yet, the trade-offs and synergies associated with CSA practices have not been explored. This study develops composite indices for prioritizing CSA practices to better inform policy about their trade-offs, synergies and acceptability. The aim of this study was to examine smallholder farmers' uptake of CSA practices, the drivers of such uptake and the benefits (positive and negative) of CSA practices on agriculture, livelihoods and the environment. We employed the Analytic Hierarchy Process with workshop participants across two study districts in Ghana's transitional and Sudan savannah agroecological zones. Results showed differences in CSA practices prioritized for achieving the productivity, adaptive capacity and mitigation goals between the two agroecological zones. Results also showed synergies and trade-offs associated with the implementation of CSA interventions, for example, irrigation may increase farm productivity (synergy) while contributing to the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) simultaneously (trade-off). Additionally, there are various perceived acceptance and efficiency levels of CSA practices by smallholder farmers and agricultural development officers. These results have implications for the implementation of future CSA action plans in vulnerability hotspots in dryland farming systems.

J	Zhai, YY; Fang, HY				Zhai, Yuyu; Fang, Haiyan			Spatiotemporal variations of freeze-thaw erosion risk during 1991-2020 in the black soil region, northeastern China	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Freeze-thaw (FT) erosion, which occurs in high-altitude and high-latitude regions, has a considerable impact on water and wind erosion. However, studies on long-term variations of FT erosion induced risks are still limited. In the present study, based on 30-year data at 247 meteorological stations, spatiotemporal FT erosion risk in the black soil region, northeastern China was evaluated through the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Entropy-weight method (EWM). Six FT erosion-related variables, including annual FT cycle days, soil water content (SWC), fraction vegetation coverage (FVC), slope, soil bulk density (BD), and soil structural stability (SSI) were used to assess FT erosion risk in the study region. Among these variables, the slope was the most important variable (45 %), followed by annual FT cycle days (15 %), FVC (15 %), and SSI (14 %). FT erosion risk differed in different land use types. Woodland, residential land and grassland suffered severe FT erosion risk, and paddy and dryland suffered slight FT erosion risk. Complex topography areas had a higher FT erosion risk. During past 30 years, global warming mitigated the FT erosion risk. This study can help understand soil erosion characteristics and soil loss control for the Chinese black soil region and similar regions in the world.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				APR	2023	148								110149	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110149	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110149		MAR 2023											WOS:000971343100001
J	Guan, C; Chen, N; Qiao, LJ; Zhao, CM				Guan, Chao; Chen, Ning; Qiao, Linjie; Zhao, Changming			Photosynthesis regulates the diel hysteresis pattern between soil respiration and soil temperature in a steppe grassland	GEODERMA												Soil respiration is an important ecosystem process in drylands and is closely related to soil temperature but often occurs out of phase with soil temperature. As ecosystem engineers in dryland ecosystems, biological soil crusts (biocrusts) greatly affect soil carbon cycle processes, such as soil respiration. However, the diel hysteresis pattern between soil respiration and soil temperature at biocrusted microsites and its influencing factors are not well understood. Here, we performed continuous field measurements of in situ soil respiration to evaluate the effect of biocrusts on the diurnal cycles of soil respiration and the influencing factors of the diel hysteresis pattern between soil respiration and soil temperature at biocrusted microsites. Over daily cycles, soil respiration peaked earlier than soil temperature, and their relationship exhibited similar clockwise hysteresis loops at both bare and biocrusted microsites. Unexpectedly, the effect of biocrusts on the diel hysteresis pattern between soil respiration and soil temperature was negligible. However, photosynthesis may be the key driver regulating the diel hysteresis pattern between soil respiration and soil temperature, because little or even no hysteresis was observed between soil respiration and photosynthetically active radiation. Our results highlight the important role of photosynthate transportation in plants or biocrusts in diel hysteresis pattern regulation between soil respiration and soil temperature.																			0016-7061	1872-6259				FEB 15	2022	408								115561	10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115561	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115561		NOV 2021											WOS:000725437100009

These systems consist of dams, field plots, field towers, cisterns and thousands of human-made stone mounds. In the environment of Shivta, these systems also included built dovecotes to produce dung to fertilize vineyards and orchards. All of these elements established an intensive agronomic practice. Extensive survey and excavations in one completely preserved agricultural system in a small wadi in the hinterland of Shivta, followed by OSL dating of loess accumulations in the adjacent agricultural installations, in addition to dates from archaeological finds, revealed clear stratigraphic and chronological sequences. We found that the first human-made components were established in the Roman period (1st-2nd centuries CE) and the agricultural system flourished during the Byzantine period (5th-6th centuries CE) before it was abandoned in the post-Byzantine era. At its peak, all artificial components of the system would have had to operate together at an optimum level to make intensive agriculture possible. This agricultural system is a prime example of the enormous skill and knowledge of Shivta farmers in synergizing different agricultural installations to maintain agriculture in a desert environment.

Asiatic wild ass or khulan (Equus hemionus) were widespread and abundant throughout the arid landscapes of Central Asia and Mongolia, but have undergone dramatic population declines and range constrictions; denying khulan access to water is believed to have played a major role. Mongolia's South Gobi Region now houses the world largest remaining khulan population, but is undergoing rapid land use changes. Khulan water use is poorly understood, largely due to the difficulty of mapping waterpoints used by khulan throughout their exceptionally large ranges, prone to high variations in precipitation. We used the special movement path characteristics of GPS tagged khulan to show us where water is located. We identified 367 waterpoints, 53 of which were of population importance, characterized the seasonal and circadian use, and identified snow cover as the most important variable predicting khulan visits during the non-growing season, and vegetation greenness during the growing season. Our results provide a data layer to help guide a regional khulan conservation strategy, allow predictions for other part of the global khulan range, and illustrates the overall importance of waterpoints for dryland herbivores.

However, most studies to date just focused on water supply services, and ignore water demand services and their supply-demand coupling mechanisms. Ecosystem service flow could be used to evaluate the imbalance between water supply and demand. Therefore, this study takes the Yellow River Basin as the research object to quantify the supply, demand, and spatial flow of water provision services. The results showed that land use and land cover (LULC) played a critical role in the spatial distributions of water supply and demand in the Yellow River Basin. The total water supply was 3.03 x 10(11) m(3), with a range of 3.29 x 10(8) m(3) to 7.35 x 10(10) m(3) for different sub-watersheds. The spatial patterns of water supply were strongly different from those in water demand, resulting in obvious spatial mismatches. There was a higher water demand for constructional areas and agricultural lands, which had relatively lower water supply. Most water areas and natural lands provide much more water supply than demand. We used a water flow process to assess the water provision service between water supply side and demand side. The water flow process suggested that the Yellow River Basin had an obvious imbalance between water supply and demand depending on land use and populations, which would help policy makers to manage water resources through optimizing land management in different cities and finally achieving a balance between water supply side and demand site.

Chemotaxonomic responses of autotrophic periphyton communities to nutrient additions in pools of an intermittent stream	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The algal groups present in periphyton communities form an important base of autochthonous food webs in freshwater streams. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are key macronutrients in aquatic systems. Excess nutrients benefit some algal groups over others. We paired a nutrient-diffusing substrata limitation experiment with high performance liquid chromatography to (a) identify which nutrient(s) limit periphyton production, and (b) how the periphyton biomass and community structure changes between isolated pools of differing hydrological characteristics along an intermittent dryland stream. Unique peaks for 21 pigments were identified and matched with published values. We then produced a PERMANOVA model using pigment ratios and CHEMTAX analysis to explore changes in community structure resulting from nutrient addition. Periphyton communities in these pools were co-limited by N and P. Nitrogen additions caused the periphyton to shift from diatom- to chlorophyte-dominated community structure and benefited cyanophyta growth. Phosphorus additions reduced the relative proportion of diatoms and also resulted in an increase in pheophoribide-a, a pigment indicative of cell lysis, demonstrating a detrimental impact of P additions. Outcomes of this study show that when adding nutrient to a system there may be subtle shifts in community composition which can be telescoped up the food web regardless of the system's nutrient status.

J	Viles, H; Coombes, M				Viles, Heather; Coombes, Martin			Biogeomorphology in the Anthropocene: A hierarchical, traits-based approach	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The complex web of interactions between ecological communities and the physical landscape (bio-geomorphology) is being affected by the global scale environmental changes of the Anthropocene. Climate change, habitat destruction, invasions and extinctions are having profound impacts on biogeomorphological process regimes through changes in the composition and activity of ecological communities. However, on the other hand, deliberately-targeted human interventions to biogeomorphic systems have the potential to help mitigate against, and adapt to, the Anthropocene, by managing biogeomorphic processes to enhance resilience. To evaluate these relationships, we propose a conceptual framework based on the ecological concept of func-tional traits. We review how the Anthropocene is causing changes in species composition, abundance and the prevalence of functional traits to produce changes to biogeomorphic processes and functions that are, as yet, only partly understood. We use examples of fluvial, dryland and coastal biogeomorphic systems to illustrate how purposeful manipulation of biogeomorphic systems (as a type of Nature-based solution) can conserve, enhance or add biogeomorphic functions that are capable of enhancing geomorphic resilience. By focussing on function, this approach offers a range of advantages/avenues for biogeomorphological research. This includes the detection and prediction of human impacts, and an improved understanding of how biogeomorphology can contribute to tackling environmental challenges in the Anthropocene.																			0169-555X	1872-695X				NOV 15	2022	417								108446	10.1016/j.geomorph.2022.108446	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2022.108446		SEP 2022											WOS:000865431600002

The vegetation survey was conducted using the point-centered quarter method. The fruit yield of 54 trees was also evaluated. Tree density and fruit production in ha were estimated. There was a significant difference in Tamarind tree density between the two land-use types (p = 0.01). The mean fruit yield of farmland trees was significantly higher than that of bushland trees. However, Tamarind has unsustainable structure on farmlands. Differences in the dendrometric characteristics of trees were also observed between the two land-use types. Predictive models were selected for Tamarind fruit yield estimations in both land-use types. Although the majority of farmland trees produced <5000 fruit year(-1), the selection of Tamarind germplasm in its natural ranges could improve production. Thus, the development of management plans to establish stands that have a more balanced diameter structure and thereby ensure continuity of the population and fruit yields is required in this area, particularly in the farmlands. This baseline information could assist elsewhere in areas that are facing similar challenges for the species due to land-use change.

We investigated how drought affected the morphology and physiology of two C4 species with different root architecture, Calligonum arborescens and Haloxylon ammodendron, in the Taklamakan Desert. We measured leaf traits, chlorophyll fluorescence and temperature responses of photosynthesis after-3 years of experimental drought and asked: (1) Do both species adjust similarly to drought? (2) Does transpirational cooling increase at high temperature, and if so, how is this affected by drought? Drought plants of H. ammodendron had shorter and thinner leaves than controls, and lower chlorophyll content, photochemical efficiency, and electron transport rate. In contrast, C. arborescens leaves became shorter and thicker. Drought reduced maximum photosynthesis by 63 % and 21 % in H. ammodendron and C. arborescens, respectively. The optimum temperature did not change significantly in H. ammodendron and decreased by-2 degrees C in C. arborescens. Surprisingly, above 40-45 degrees C, stomatal conductance (gsw) and transpiration increased-even under drought stomata partially reopened. This consistent uncoupling of photosynthesis and gsw suggests that widely-implemented stomatal optimization models may poorly reflect high-temperature behaviors in dryland ecosystems. Our study established the basis for predicting the eco-physiological responses of C4 species in hyper-arid ecosystems to climate change.

J	Nunes, AM; Byrne, KM				Nunes, Allison M.; Byrne, Kerry M.			Drought and shrub cover differentially affect seed bank composition within two sagebrush steppe communities	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Soil seed banks are critical biodiversity repositories for dryland plant communities. Understanding how environmental factors alter seed bank composition provides valuable information on ecological processes within a community and can be useful for creating land management strategies. We assessed seed bank response to drought and microsite within an Artemisia arbuscula dominated community and a directly adjacent (similar to 60m apart) A. cana dominated community, and characterized the similarity between these two seed banks and the corresponding aboveground vegetation. We found that drought increased exotic grass seed density and decreased seed species diversity and evenness within the A. arbuscula community, whereas shrub microsites enhanced seed species diversity and native forb seed density. In contrast, there were only minor drought effects within the A. cana community. Within both plant communities, there was low similarity between the seed bank and existing vegetation (<28%), and both seed banks were comprised of over 50% exotic annual grass seeds. Our study suggests that seed banks of drylands similar to A. arbuscula dominated plant communities (with heterogenous landscapes and low soil moisture availability) may experience more drought induced impacts than adjacent sagebrush communities, and highlights the role of shrub canopies as beneficial microsites for seeds in some drylands.

Soil and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) tissue samples were analyzed to determine the macronutrient dynamics associated with residue management methods and fertilizer rate under a dryland winter wheat-fallow rotation. The treatments included: no burn residue incorporation with farmyard manure (FYM) or pea vines, no burn or spring burn with application of N fertilizer (0, 45, and 90 kg ha(-1)), and fall burn wheat residue incorporation. The results revealed no differences on the effect of residue burning on macronutrient concentration over time. After receiving the same treatments for 84 years, the concentrations of soil organic C, total N and S, and extractable Mg, K, P in the 0-10 cm depth significantly increased in FYM plots compared to the rest of the plots. The N fertilization rate of 90 kg ha(-1) reduced the accumulations of P, K, and Ca in grain compared to the 0 and 45 kg N ha(-1) applications. The results indicate that residue incorporation with FYM can play vital role in reducing the macronutrient decline over time.

J	Kheirfam, H				Kheirfam, Hossein			Increasing soil potential for carbon sequestration using microbes from biological soil crusts	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Dryland soils have the potential to be large atmospheric carbon (C) sinks, thus aiding in managing global warming. In these areas, soil micro-organisms found in biological soil crusts (biocrusts) can play a major role in C cycling, especially by influencing the fluxes between the atmosphere and soil; however, their potential has been reduced due to degradation. Thus, we assessed how inoculating soil micro-organisms and adding microbial stimulant nutrients onto a degraded soil affected C sequestration. Therefore, a full factorial combination of bacteria, cyanobacteria and nutrients was added to the field-collected soil. After 60 days, we measured the effect of this inoculation with and without support by a nutrient (B4) addition on the soil organic C; then, we calculated the C sequestration and the potential CO2 removal from the atmosphere. We found that inoculating bacteria, cyanobacteria, or a combination of them increased the sequestrated C in the soil from 0.232 to 0.294 g m(-2) day(-1) at the plot scale; when calculations were used to scale up, this increase was from 0.84 to 1.07 ton ha(-1) year(-1). This could remove 3.11-3.93 ton ha(-1) year(-1) of CO2 from the atmosphere. However, nutrient addition had no significant effect on the C pools.

The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) has been tasked with addressing the global challenges posed by land degradation. Although the complexities around land degradation have more recently been acknowledged, spatial modelling of this phenomenon remains a global challenge. In this study, measures of productivity derived from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2A data have been integrated with local climate, land use, and socio-economic data to provide a more meaningful regional conceptual framework for land degradation. We create a novel method to map land condition utilising a set of 26 biological, topographic, climatic and land use covariates. The model results can be viewed in isolation as a measure of vegetation cover but are more useful when interpreted within the context of the environmental covariates. This can be accomplished through the Succulent Karoo Land Condition Inspector Google Earth Engine application. The data are intended to assist conservation planners in providing spatial data related to the current condition of the land in the biome, as well as to highlight areas where biodiversity is potentially at greater threat and where restoration initiatives or climate change adaptation are most needed.

J	Higgisson, W; Reynolds, B; Cross, Y; Dyer, F				Higgisson, William; Reynolds, Breanna; Cross, Yasmin; Dyer, Fiona			Seed germination requirements of an Australian semi-arid floodplain Acacia species, Acacia stenophylla	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Plants that occur on floodplains in dryland regions often use floods to disperse and germinate seeds, which establish during and following flooding events. Acacia stenophylla (river cooba) is a perennial tree, common in the riparian habitats of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. The aims of this study were to (1) determine the relationship between seed germination and seedling establishment of A. stenophylla and hydrological conditions, (2) determine the buoyancy of its seeds and, hence, ability to disperse by hydrochory and (3) provide recommendations on the hydrological requirements for A. stenophylla recruitment. Seedling recruitment data collected between 2014 and 2020 on the floodplain of the lower Lachlan River were compared with time since flooding. In a glasshouse experiment, seeds of A. stenophylla within their pods and with their pods removed were exposed to one of five experimental treatments (rainfall, soaked soil, and inundated for 20 and 40 days), over a period of 50 days. A. stenophylla germinated during and following flooding and following high rainfall. Seeds in pods floated for 8 days. A. stenophylla establishes during and following flooding and requires 1 month of flooding followed by flood recession to maximise seed germination. This research contributes to our broader understanding of the reproductive biology of one of the less studied Acacia species.

In Hawai'i, more than 45% of TDF species are threatened or endangered. Despite decades of active TDF restoration, there remains limited information on the potential for long-term success, since there are few studies of natural regeneration. We assess natural regeneration of endangered plants at Ka'upulehu dryland forest, a Hawaiian biocultural restoration initiative. Drawing on 6 annual censuses we (1) assess rates and patterns of natural regeneration across species and as a function of rainfall and (2) identify bottlenecks. Our surveys document natural recruits of 11 of the 12 endangered species first outplanted 15-20 years ago. Higher annual rainfall increased the number of new recruits per year and growth, but decreased survival of larger recruits. The total number of natural recruits increased three-fold over the study period and varied across species. For nearly half of the species, we documented a second generation of recruits. Successes appear to be a function of time, including a changing microclimate and adaptive management practices. Remaining bottlenecks include lack of seed dispersal, and seed predation and herbivory by introduced species. The success at Ka'upulehu highlights the potential for TDF restoration and the value of a biocultural approach.																				2071-1050				FEB	2022	14	3							1159	10.3390/su14031159	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14031159													WOS:000755995200001

However, cloudy/rainy climate conditions can easily lead to a lack of valid optical data, leading to crop classification difficulties. A general solution is taking advantage of all-weather synthetic aperture radar (SAR) datasets. In practice, SAR and optical datasets are often applied in the agricultural field by the method of image fusion, but it is difficult to apply when the number of optical images is too small. To solve this problem, this research proposes a data-transfer and feature-optimize-based method, which deploy an RNN-based encoding-decoding network to add additional data to the 'optical' temporal features at the farmland parcel scale and improve the utilization of optical fragments. On the basis of this method, we mitigate inconsistencies in spatial scale among different datasets and optimize the time-series parameters without expert knowledge in the crop classification procedure. The experimental results illustrate the crop classification accuracy of this method, which achieves a 4.1% improvement over the traditional approach and is especially effective for dryland crops (e.g. corn and rapeseed). Thus, this research demonstrates the effectiveness of the combined use of optical and SAR data for similar applications in cloudy/rainy mountainous areas.

The management of SI at the field level is well documented but little is known about planning at basin scale. This work uses a geographic information system-based modelling approach together with suitability criteria to identify potential areas for expanding SI at scale. A spatial water allocation algorithm is developed to model SI water allocation using data layers consisting of climate surfaces, classified land-use maps, and a digital elevation model. Areas are prioritized stepwise, according to land suitability, until the available water is fully utilized. The analysis was applied in a watershed in western Iran. The analysis revealed that, with SI, available water resources in the winter season can supplementally irrigate a new land area of about 2,900 ha, about twice the area conventionally irrigated in the dry season. However, adopting a deficit SI strategy allows irrigation of additional 3,220 ha, more than double of the current water allocation efficiency. The approach can be applied in any rainfed area with available water without major modifications, but further analysis is needed to evaluate its economics at scale.

Soil water repellency after wildfires in the Blue Ridge Mountains, United States	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												It is not well understood if wildfires induce soil water repellency in broadleaf deciduous forests, such as those endemic to the Blue Ridge Mountains of the eastern United States. In 2016, widespread wildfires provided an opportunity to study soil water repellency in this region. We selected sites in four locations with low to moderate burn severities, along with unburned controls. We estimated soil water repellency using water drop penetration time measurements from the surface (i.e. ash or organic) layer to similar to 5 cm within the underlying mineral layer. Two months after the fires, water repellency was detected in all locations and was greater in more severely burned sites. One location had the greatest water repellency in surface ash (frequency of occurrence: 68-74%), whereas the other locations showed greatest repellency at the ash-mineral interface (40-96%). Unburned soils rarely showed repellency (0-18%). Burned soils also exhibited water repellency 1 year post fire. The study results suggest that combustion of non-resinous foliage within litter layers can cause water repellency in deciduous forests, meaning that this condition is not exclusive to coniferous and dryland forests. The duration of impact depends on fire severity, and may enhance overland flow and sediment transport in affected landscapes.

Hochst is a threatened tropical dryland tree species. It is the source of frankincense, valued for its industrial, religious and traditional uses. This tree species is reported as under threat due to mortality from wound and inappropriate frankincense harvesting techniques. Two experiments were conducted simultaneously in the lowlands of North Western Gonder Zone, Ethiopia. The first experiment aimed to understand the effect of tapping height and tree size on wound recovery and frankincense yield and the second experiment dealt with understanding the effect of tapping schedule on survival and frankincense yield of different tree diameter sizes. Larger trees tapped at 1 m above the ground had the fastest wound recovery and highest frankincense yield. Higher tree survival was observed when tapping and resting schedule was alternated over years. However, mortality was higher when trees were tapped in consecutive years, without a resting year. The mean frankincense yield was 78 and 535 g/tree/year for small and large trees, respectively. Our result suggested that tree size, tapping height and resting time all have a significant effect on frankincense yield and wound recovery. Alternate year tapping of larger trees, with resting every three years, and avoiding tapping small trees are recommended for best wound recovery, survival, and to ensure sustainable production of frankincense.

In this study, we determined the effects of RFRH on the soil fungal community composition and diversity in a 5-year fertilisation experiment (N : P fertiliser rates of 0 : 0, 150 : 75, 300 : 150, and 450 : 225 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) in the dryland farming area of the Loess Plateau. Excessive fertiliser application reduced the crop productivity and a moderate rate of 300 : 150 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) produced the highest maize yield. The available phosphorus (AP), organic carbon, nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) and total nitrogen contents increased with the fertiliser rate, whereas soil water content decreased. The relative abundances of Ascomycota, Fusarium and Zygomycota increased (P < 0.05) with the fertiliser application rate, whereas those of Basidiomycota and Glomeromycota decreased (P < 0.05). The fungal diversity (Shannon-Wiener index: P = 0.016) and composition (unweighted UniFrac: P = 0.024) were significantly affected by fertilisation. The NO3-N and AP were the main factors that affected fungal composition and diversity. Thus, fertilisation changed the fungal community composition and diversity, and a higher fertiliser rate negatively affected nutrient cycling and the stability of the soil ecosystem under RFRH.

In dryland Africa, pastoral landscapes are faced with challenges of land degradation, livestock diseases, droughts, and land use conflicts. In order to enhance resilience and integrity of pastoral societies and landscapes, sustainable land management (SLM) requires that policies and institutions create an enabling environment that encourages sustainable use. This study analyses current policy, institutional, and governance challenges in relation to SLM in Ngamiland, Botswana. We use a series of expert interviews, local stakeholder workshops, document, and policy content analysis to analyse policy and institutional challenges. Key findings of this study include fragmented institutional and policy frameworks, conflicting policies and priorities, weak governance structures, lack of integrated planning and coordination between sectors, gaps in communication, knowledge gaps, and fragmented pastoralists lobbying institutions, all of which hinders prospects for SLM in communal areas of Botswana. Harmonisation of sectoral policies requires institutional and policy design to consider institutional coordination and enhanced learning on other actors' perspectives and constraints. Findings in Ngamiland show that collaborative comanagement approaches can play a role in facilitating intersectoral data sharing to enable successful development of pastoral landscapes and a supportive decision-making system for SLM.

J	Dovrat, G; Sheffer, E				Dovrat, Guy; Sheffer, Efrat			Symbiotic dinitrogen fixation is seasonal and strongly regulated in water-limited environments	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												Plants, especially perennials, growing in drylands and seasonally dry ecosystems are uniquely adapted to dry conditions. Legume shrubs and trees, capable of symbiotic dinitrogen (N-2) fixation, often dominate in drylands. However, the strategies that allow symbiotic fixation in these ecosystems, and their influence on the nitrogen cycle, are largely unresolved. We evaluated the climatic, biogeochemical and ontogenetic factors influencing nitrogen fixation in an abundant Mediterranean legume shrub, Calicotome villosa. We measured nodulation, fixation rate, nitrogen allocation and soil biogeochemistry in three field sites over a full year. A controlled experiment evaluated differences in plant regulation of fixation as a function of soil nutrient availability and seedling and adult developmental stages. We found a strong seasonal pattern, shifting between high fixation rates during the rainy season at flowering and seed-set times to almost none in the rainless season. Under controlled conditions, plants downregulated fixation in response to soil nitrogen availability, but this response was stronger in seedlings than in adult shrubs. Finally, we did not find elevated soil nitrogen under N-2-fixing shrubs. We conclude that seasonal nitrogen fixation, regulation of fixation, and nitrogen conservation are key adaptations influencing the dominance of dryland legumes in the community, with broader consequences on the ecosystem nitrogen cycle.																			0028-646X	1469-8137				MAR	2019	221	4					1866	1877		10.1111/nph.15526	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.15526								30299536					WOS:000458259600021

Therefore, PFM has become one of the most widely used on-farm management practices for maize cultivation in semi-arid regions. The effects of PFM-induced warming on the labile carbon (C) pools and microorganisms remain unclear. We used high-throughput genomic sequencing to assess bacterial community structure and metabolic functions in soils after short- (2 years) and long-term (10 years) cover with PFM in a dryland agriculture system. Strong decrease of dissolved organic C (DOC) pool (14-18 % less than in Control soil) by warming (2.4 degrees C) raised bacterial alpha-diversity. The short-term mulch reduced the absolute abundance of bacteria by 36-43 % due to the temperature rise and labile C reduction. Bacteria developed with lower abundance (e.g., smaller colonies) but with higher diversity in soils with less available resources. During the long-term mulching and microbial acclimation to increased temperature and the reduced labile C, the bacterial community strongly changed towards an oligotrophic life history. The PFM increased the abundance of bacterial species with high nutrient uptake (e.g. Patescibacteria increased by 83 %), while chemotrophs that prefer eutrophic conditions were reduced in the PFM soil (e.g. Actinobacteriota by 11 %). The PFM increased the complexity of co-occurring networks of bacterial communities and decreased their stability. Almost all bacterial marker taxa screened by random forest algorithm differed between Control and Mulch soils. Long-term mulching reduced the rate of bacterial metabolism associated with organic matter degradation, such as metabolism of carbohydrates, esters (propanoate and butanoate decreased strongly), lipids (the greatest reduction was for fatty acids), and amino acids (lysine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation pathways dropped the most). Structural equation modeling indicated that bacterial metabolism was mainly influenced by bacterial community structure. Consequently, the metabolic functions of bacteria were reduced after the decrease of C availability induced by warming under PFM, and this reduction was dependent on the duration of PFM application.

Evaluation of WRCC is important in balancing the availability of water resources with society's economic and environmental demands. Given the demand for sustainable utilization of agricultural water resources, we combine the water stress index and comprehensive index of WRCC and use multi-source data to evaluate agricultural WRCC and its influencing factors at the township scale. It makes up for the deficiencies of current research, such as the existence of single-index evaluation systems, limited calibration data, and a lack of a sub-watershed (i.e., township) scale. By applying multi-source data, this study expands the spatial scale of WRCC assessment and establishes a multidimensional evaluation framework for the water resources in dryland agriculture. The results indicate water stress index ranges from 0.52 to 1.67, and the comprehensive index of WRCC ranges from 0.25 to 0.70, which are significantly different in different types of irrigation areas and townships. Water quantity and water management are key factors influencing WRCC, the water ecosystem is an area requiring improvement, and the water environment is not a current constraint. Different irrigation areas and different types of townships should implement targeted measures to improve WRCC.

However, illuminating the processes influencing functional connectivity and ultimately translating this knowledge into management practice remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we combine various population structure analyses with pairwise, population-specific demographic modeling to investigate historical functional connectivity in Graham's beardtongue (Penstemon grahamii), a rare plant narrowly distributed across a dryland region of the western US. While principal component and population structure analyses indicated an isolation-by-distance pattern of differentiation across the species' range, spatial inferences of effective migration exposed an abrupt shift in population ancestry near the range center. To understand these seemingly conflicting patterns, we tested various models of historical gene flow and found evidence for recent admixture (similar to 3400 generations ago) between populations near the range center. This historical perspective reconciles population structure patterns and suggests management efforts should focus on maintaining connectivity between these previously isolated lineages to promote the ongoing transfer of genetic variation. Beyond providing species-specific knowledge to inform management options, our study highlights how understanding demographic history may be critical to guide conservation efforts when interpreting population genetic patterns and inferring functional connectivity.

The study was conducted for spatial modelling of aeolian sediment transport over adjacent plots managed by wheat-fallow rotation system under rainfed agriculture in the semi-arid region of Turkey. Four erosion events took place and the results were evaluated using data of 8 measurements over two plots during events. Wind-driven sediment transport rates (Q(t)) varied between 0.0015 and 0.0075 kg m(-1) h(-1), highly depending upon the prevalent land surface characteristics during each case, and there was no event-based conclusion that the semi-arid dryland fallow system would exacerbate wind erosion losses when Q(t) values from either plot were compared. Of all cases, particularly, the greatest soil loss occurred in Case 3 over the fallow plot, for which Qt values were 0.0075 kg m(-1) h(-1) when wheat crop provided full soil cover above the next plot. Geostatistical analyses revealed the range values as between 450 and 800 m. Kriging maps showed that spatial patterns of Qt values of cases for both land uses were almost quite different.					kaplan, sema/AAL-2241-2020; INCE, KENAN/AAC-7060-2021; İNCE, Kenan/AAG-6054-2019	INCE, KENAN/0000-0002-7555-0248; 													0365-0340	1476-3567				APR 16	2022	68	5					661	675		10.1080/03650340.2020.1849624	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2020.1849624		DEC 2020											WOS:000598931800001

This study provides a theory-driven evaluation to ascertain the causes of desertification intervention's poor performance. It provides a conceptual model for scaling up interventions towards achieving the 2030 target 15:3 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Guided by intervention theory, relevant policy documents on desertification control were analyzed via Qualitative Document Analysis and triangulated by a semi-structured interview, and secondary data with the aid of ATLAS.ti 8. Findings revealed that a weak integration of Sustainable Practice across the policy cycle is responsible for notable gaps in the areas of an absence of participation of Civil Society Organizations and the use of Indigenous Knowledge, non-involvement of local government, and poor community ownership. Others include monitoring lapses, and the non-inclusion of the Land Degradation Neutrality concept - leading to failure in the Sustainability of Policy Instrument. A pragmatic approach integrating multi-stakeholder participation, the establishment of grass-root structure, and situation awareness should be incorporated across the policy cycle. The need for the development of Key Performance Indicators for tracking the progress of the Pan-African Great Green Wall initiative is also required.

Such underwater Solar energy has tremendous potential to be used in many commercial and defense applications like sensors, underwater vehicles, autonomous power systems, etc. Nowadays, another major constraint in Solar PV systems is the cooling and cleaning of PV cells, which can also be overcome by placing PV cells underwater. Although the Solar spectrum itself changes underwater and becomes narrower with increasing the water depth, yet one of the possible solutions is using a suitable type of Solar cells for maximum power conversion underwater. In this work, an experimental setup has been designed and implemented to create an underwater environment. Further, Solar cells have been encapsulated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and diverse characterizations have been accomplished to sense the behavior of amorphous and monocrystalline cells with different water types. This study gives a better understanding to monitor the performance characteristics of Solar PV cells underwater with various factors such as the water depth, type of Solar cell, salinity, total dissolved salts and other impurities which will immensely affect the performance of Solar cells underwater.

However, little is known regarding the identity and distribution of the microbial components in the photosynthetic assemblages that form a cohesive biological soil crust (biocrust) in drylands of Europe. In this study, we investigated the cyanobacterial species colonizing biocrusts in three representative dryland ecosystems from the most arid region in Europe (SE Spain) that are characterized by different soil conditions. Isolated cyanobacterial cultures were identified by a polyphasic approach, including 16S rRNA gene sequencing, phylogenetic relationship determination, and morphological and ecological habitat assessments. Three well-differentiated groups were identified: heterocystous-cyanobacteria (Nostoc commune, Nostoc calicola, Tolypothrix distorta and Scytonema hyalinum), which play an important role in N and C cycling in soil; nonheterocystous bundle-forming cyanobacteria (Microcoleus steenstrupii, Trichocoleus desertorum, and Schizothrix cf. calcicola); and narrow filamentous cyanobacteria (Leptolyngbya frigida and Oculatella kazantipica), all of which are essential genera for initial biocrust formation. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of cyanobacterial species composition in biocrusts from important and understudied European habitats, such as the Mediterranean Basin, a hotspot of biodiversity, where these species are keystone pioneer organisms.

The methods and results have two parts. Firstly, a case study from the northern grains region examines the use of BMPs for managing climate risks associated with both climate variability and climate change. A series of industry workshops developed and tested a suite of 24 BMP standards for growing dryland grain crops, including four BMPs on risk management based on the Australian Standards for Risk Management. Secondly, priorities for research on climate change adaptation in the primary industries sector are described and evaluated to assess needs for updating, in response to industry and environmental changes. The analysis reveals strong reasons for increasing the priority given to education and extension on risk management and for developing BMPs for both incremental and transformative adaptation, and especially for deriving methods to achieve widespread adoption of BMPs for managing extreme climatic events. Collaborative development of BMPs involving farmers'Andustry/scientists is the process most likely to derive robust BMPs to withstand the complexities of climate risk and build greater resilience of communities and ecosystems.

To provide scientific support for the land-use planning and regional ecological restoration to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) in the Loess Plateau from 1992 to 2015, this study proposes an integrated assessment framework for assessing the supply - demand match and equilibrium of ES combining potential relationships between landscape alterations, ES, and sustainable development at the county and regional scales. Results show that more than 85% of local counties have a supply - demand mismatch in terms of ecosystem services. Supply - demand distributions for provisioning and supporting services were relatively balanced compared to cultural services, which were imbalanced. Although the overall supply - demand relationship is relatively balanced because of the significant influence of ecological restoration, it shows an increasing trend toward imbalance as human - land conflict is prominent in some regions. SDGs emphasize on specific ES information such as ecosystem conservation, sustainable agriculture, and urban construction. Furtherly, positive impacts from landscape dynamics can improve the supply capacity of the ES and contribute to regional sustainability.						huang, jiejun/0000-0003-2595-4946; Liang, Youjia/0000-0002-1503-3417													2096-4129	2332-8878				DEC 31	2022	8	1							2130093	10.1080/20964129.2022.2130093	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20964129.2022.2130093													WOS:000864000300001

Plastic mulch exhibits greater potential in rainwater harvesting while nitrogen (N) fertilizer has a strong effect on soil water utilization. Most of annual precipitation in the Loess Plateau occurs in summer. Rainwater retention in summer fallow becomes very important for winter wheat production in the dryland of the Loess Plateau. Straw mulching in summer fallow are commonly used to prevent water evaporation from soil surface and retain rainwater. Recently plastic mulching has also been used. Nitrogen inputs have also a significant impact on soil water utilization and yield production. However, there is little information available for the effects of full coverage of plots with plastic mulch (PM) in summer fallow on soil water storage at sowing and N rates interact with the soil water utilization in winter wheat yield, water use efficiency (WUE) and grain protein concentration (GPC). Therefore, field experiments were conducted in three consecutive years with variable rainfall. The results showed that PM in summer fallow increased soil water storage at sowing by at least 50 mm, and water storage efficiency was the highest (56.5%) in the dry season. Spatio-temporal dynamics in the soil water storage of 0-300 cm depth exhibited a downward movement with crop development. Approximately half of soil water consumption from flowering to maturity was derived from the 200-300 cm soil layers. The optimal N rate with PM increased grain yield by 27% in the wet season, 36% in the normal season, and 41% in the dry season. PM in combination with optimized N could improve WUE only when annual rainfall is equal to or above the yearly average. Furthermore, evapotranspiration is negatively correlated with GPC although the soil water consumption from 200 to 300 cm depth is positively correlated with post-anthesis N uptake. This suggests that the additional N is needed to further increase GPC. In the season with soil water storage of 550-600 mm at sowing, the N rate of 225 kg ha(-1) with PM could achieve the highest yield and 13.2% of GPC. In the season with soil water storage of 450-550 mm at sowing, the N rate of 150 kg ha(-1) with PM could achieve the highest yield, and 14.3% of GPC. When the season with soil water storage of approximately 400 mm, the N rate of 75 kg ha(-1) with PM achieved the highest yield, and 15.0% of GPC. Our results indicate that adjusting N fertilizer inputs based on seasonal variation in summer rainfall could enhance wheat yield and GPC in the southeast region of the Loess Plateau.					deng, yan/JDW-8815-2023	yang, zhenping/0000-0003-2991-3674													0378-3774	1873-2283				MAY 1	2019	216						379	389		10.1016/j.agwat.2019.01.023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.01.023													WOS:000461262400035

We present new archaeobotanical and radiocarbon data from combustion features within stratified cultural components at Connley Caves, Oregon, that reaffirm the inclusion of plants in the diet of Paleoindian groups. Botanical remains from three features in Connley Cave 5 show that people foraged for diverse dryland taxa and a narrow range of wetland plants during the summer and fall months. These data add new taxa to the known Pleistocene food economy and support the idea that groups equipped with Western Stemmed Tradition toolkits had broad, flexible diets. When viewed continentally, this work contributes to a growing body of research indicating that regionally adapted subsistence strategies were in place by at least the Younger Dryas and that some foragers in the Far West may have incorporated a wider range of plants including small seeds, leafy greens, fruits, cacti, and geophytes into their diet earlier than did Paleoindian groups elsewhere in North America. The increasing appearance of diverse and seemingly low-ranked resources in the emerging Paleoindian plant-food economy suggests the need to explore a variety of nutritional variables to explain certain aspects of early foraging behavior.

It is currently not clear how plant communities at varying elevations in arid mountainous regions will respond to climate change in terms of their productivity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of climate change on vegetation productivity in different altitudinal vegetation belts of the Tianshan Mountains between 2000 and 2021, utilizing satellite-derived vegetation productivity and climate data. The findings suggest a notable increase in vegetation productivity across diverse altitudinal vegetation belts. The productivity of vegetation in the coniferous forest and alpine meadow belts displayed a notably higher interannual trend compared to other vegetation belts. Notably, an increase in vegetation productivity was accompanied by warming and drying. The productivity of altitudinal vegetation belts, however, appears to be resilient to current climate trends and was not significantly impacted by the severity of atmospheric drought. The trend of increased vegetation productivity was primarily driven by CO2 fertilization. Our results highlight that the extent of climate change may need to reach a threshold to noticeably affect variations in vegetation productivity in arid mountainous.																				1999-4907				NOV	2023	14	11							2189	10.3390/f14112189	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f14112189													WOS:001109430700001

Benthic diatoms in relation to environmental factors in an allochthonous river from Patagonia, Argentina	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Natural and human pressures increasingly threatening the biodiversity and water resources of dryland rivers. Fluvial environments of Patagonia harbour high diatom diversity, but their management value is overlooked. The aim of this study is to explore the diatom distribution in surface sediments of the Chubut River and evaluate their relationship with environmental variables. In total, 243 diatom taxa were identified in 16 littoral zone sites. The physical and chemical variables independently explained the variance in diatom data, whereas sediment texture had a low influence. Conductivity, major ions (HCO3-, Cl-, SO42-, Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+) and pH were the main environmental drivers explaining the diatom composition. As the highlighted variables increased near the mouth, so did the relative abundances of marine-brackish taxa such as Amphora copulatoides, Sarcophagodes alfred-wegeneri, Nitzschia fonticola and Tryblionella apiculata. Meanwhile, the presence of high pollution-tolerant diatoms can be put forward to explain the river health deterioration towards downstream areas. The marine-brackish taxa found at freshwater sites reflect a weak tidal influence in the estuary compared with other coastal systems of Patagonia. This study provides valuable information to test the hypothesis on the ecological status of aquatic resources and the potential effects of climatic and hydrological changes in the area.																			1323-1650	1448-6059					2021	72	9					1340	1352		10.1071/MF20249	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF20249		APR 2021											WOS:000641043600001

Rational application of fertilizers requires knowledge of spatial variability of soil characteristics and crop response, which reinforces the interest of technologies that facilitates the identification of homogeneous management zones (HMZ). In this work, a pasture field of about 25 ha, integrated in the Montado mixed ecosystem (agro-silvo-pastoral), was monitored. Surveys of apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) were carried out in November 2017 and October 2018 with a Veris 2000 XA contact sensor. A total of 24 sampling points (30 x 30 m) were established in tree-free zones to allow readings of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI). Historical time series of these indices were obtained from satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) in winter and spring 2017 and 2018. Three zones with different potential productivity were defined based on the results obtained in terms of spatial variability and temporal stability of the measured parameters. These are the basis for the elaboration of differentiated prescription maps of fertilizers with variable application rate technology, taking into account the variability of soil characteristics and pasture development, contributing to the sustainability of this ecosystem.

In this paper we quantify the spatial and temporal hydrologic and geomorphic variability of a 90-km-long reach of the San Pedro River (San Pedro River) in southeastern Arizona and compare that variability to numerical models designed specifically to honor the spatial and temporal variability of alluvial channel systems in nature. A key motivation of this work is the power law frequency size distribution of wet and dry reaches observed in the San Pedro River. We demonstrate that such a distribution is consistent with self-affine fractal variations of the depth to bedrock and the channel longitudinal profile. At large spatial scales, spatial variations in depth to bedrock control the accommodation space for groundwater, which, in turn, controls spatial variations in surface water discharge. At small spatial scales, the longitudinal profile controls spatial variations in surface water discharge by changing the distance between the channel bed and the water table. These results underscore the complex spatiotemporal behavior of dryland alluvial rivers and the tight coupling that is possible between hydrologic and geomorphic processes in such systems.

Sulawesi forests have the potential to be deforested as with Sumatra and Kalimantan. This study aims to provide information on deforestation events in Sulawesi from 1990 to 2018. The data used in this study are (1) land cover in 1990, 2000, 2010; (2) Landsat 8 imagery in 2018; (3) administrative map of BIG in 2018. The methods used are (1) image classification with on-screen digitation techniques following the PPIK land cover classification guidelines, Forestry Planning Agency (2008) using ArcGIS Desktop 10.6 from ESRI; (2) overlapping maps; (3) analysis of deforestation; (4) analysis of deforestation profiles, (5) vulnerability analysis; and (6) analysis of distribution patterns of deforestation. The results showed that the profile of deforestation occurring on Sulawesi Island in the 1990-2018 observation period was dominated by profile 3-1-1 (the proportion of large forest area, the highest incidence of deforestation early stage at the beginning, at a low rate) in 13 districts. The level of vulnerability to deforestation is a non-vulnerable category (37 districts) which is directed to become a priority in handling deforestation in Sulawesi. Spatial patterns of the deforestation that occurred randomly and were scattered are dominated by shrubs, dryland agricultural activities, and small-scale plantations.

Crantz) genotypes exceeds the 2% threshold allowed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a food additive. Lowering erucic acid concentration below the FDA threshold enables marketing camelina as edible oil for human consumption, greatly expanding potential uses to include food ingredients such as marinades, salad dressings, spreads, and dips. A mutant camelina line, LE1914, created via ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis at one FAE1 locus (FAE1-B), produces seed oil with low (similar to 0.6%) erucic acid concentration (LE). This mutant trait was introgressed into elite camelina breeding lines to create LE lines adapted to Pacific Northwest dryland agriculture. These LE lines were evaluated in a large, replicated field trial in Pullman, WA, in 2019. One line, 'WA-LE1' (Reg. no. CV-15, PI 699653), exhibited agronomic performance similar to check cultivars while maintaining the low (similar to 0.6%) erucic acid concentration necessary for FDA approval as a food additive. WA-LE1 is an edible oil camelina cultivar that also contains the Group 2 herbicide resistance trait of WA-HT1 that was released in 2018. WA-LE1 should expand marketability and increase profitability of camelina crops in the Pacific Northwest.

To unlock this potential, it is crucial to understand community responses to drought in the interplay between soil properties, water management and exogenous microbes interference. Inoculation with dark septate endophytes (DSE) (Acrocalymma vagum, Paraboeremia putaminum) and Trichoderma viride on Astragalus mongholicus grown in the non-sterile soil was exposed to drought. Rhizosphere microbiome were assessed by Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 16S and ITS2 rRNA genes. Inoculation positively affected plant growth depending on DSE species and water regime. Ascomycota, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and Firmicutes were the dominant phyla. The effects of dual inoculation on bacterial community were greater than those on fungal community, and combination of P. putaminum and T. viride exerted a stronger impact on the microbiome under drought stress. The observed changes in soil factors caused by inoculation could be explained by the variations in microbiome composition. Rhizosphere microbiome mediated by inoculation exhibited distinct preferences for various growth parameters. These findings suggest that dual inoculation of DSE and T. viride enriched beneficial microbiota, altered soil nutrient status and might contribute to enhance the cultivation of medicinal plants in dryland agriculture.

This field study aimed to evaluate the effects of sowing time (optimal-April 5; late-April 27) on the quantitative and quality traits of three soybean genotypes (Galina-0 maturity group; Sava-I maturity group; and Rubin-II maturity group) under dryland conditions in Vojvodina Province (Serbia) during 2017 and 2018. The genotype Sava had higher yield in climatic-unfavorable 2017, while Rubin had a higher yield in climatic-favorable 2018. The yields significantly decreased when the soybeans were sown in late April due to reductions in the number of pods per plant, seed weight per plant, and 1000-seed weight. The reduction in yield components was likely due to the accelerated senescence of plants and the negative effect of high temperature and low precipitation during the seed filling stage. Accordingly, the various sowing times and properly chosen genotypes provide a better utilization of soil and water resources. A proper genotype selection and sowing time can contribute to a high yield. At the same time, the protein and oil contents can be altered by the sowing time, especially under water stress during the reproductive stage.

Strategies for restoring the structure and function of lichen-moss biocrust communities	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are crucial components of dryland ecosystems, but they are slow to recover following disturbance. Herein, we evaluated several methods for restoring lichen-moss biocrusts that included factorial applications of moss fragments in a water-slurry (1) with and without lichen fragments (to restore biocrust taxonomic structure), (2) with and without clay (to facilitate establishment), and (3) with and without jute ground cloth (to facilitate establishment). Three and four years after inoculation, moss and lichen cover was up to five and eight times higher on jute ground cloth than on bare ground, respectively. Lichen cover was six times higher in plots where lichen fragments were added. Clay amendments did not increase moss or lichen establishment. To understand the effects of biocrust recovery on soil properties, we measured soil inorganic nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon, and soil water availability in restoration and control plots. Restored biocrusts decreased inorganic NH4-N availability by 67% when compared to controls 3 years after inoculation, but did not influence the availability of inorganic NO3-N, soil water, or microbial biomass carbon. Our results demonstrate that adding a biocrust inoculant to jute ground cloth can expedite recovery of lichen-moss biocrust and reestablish its influence on soil properties within a few years.

J	Tomiolo, S; Bilton, MC; Tielbörger, K				Tomiolo, Sara; Bilton, Mark C.; Tielborger, Katja			Plant community stability results from shifts in species assemblages following whole community transplants across climates	OIKOS												Climate change will decrease precipitation and increase rainfall variability in eastern Mediterranean regions, with responses of plant communities largely uncertain. Here, we tested short-term responses of dryland plant communities to contrasting rainfall regimes using reciprocal transplants of soil and seed banks. We exposed three annual plant communities to very different climatic conditions along a steep rainfall gradient. We tested for the role of climate versus community origin on community response and resistance. In parallel, we asked whether origin-specific climatic adaptations predict compositional shifts across climates. Due to an extreme drought, all plants in the driest climate failed to reach maturity. For the remaining two community origins, the most dry-adapted species in each community increased in dry climate and the wet-adapted species increased in wet climate. Dry community origins showed large compositional shifts while maintaining stable plant density, biomass and species richness across climates. Conversely, wet communities showed smaller compositional shifts, but larger variation in biomass and richness. This asynchrony in species abundances in response to rainfall variability could maintain structural community stability. This, in combination with seed dormancy, has the ability to delay extinction in response to climate change. However, increasing occurrence of extreme droughts may, in the long-term, lead to loss of wet-adapted species.																			0030-1299	1600-0706				JAN	2020	129	1					70	80		10.1111/oik.06536	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.06536		SEP 2019											WOS:000488255100001

We incorporated competing microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE)-mean annual temperature (MAT) and enzyme kinetic-MAT relationships into SOC models, and compared the simulated mass-specific soil heterotrophic respiration rates with multiple published datasets of measured respiration. The measured data included 110 dryland soils globally distributed and two continental to global-scale cross-biome datasets. Model-data comparisons suggested that a positive CUE-MAT relationship best predicts the measured mass-specific soil heterotrophic respiration rates in soils distributed globally. These results are robust when considering models of increasing complexity and competing mechanisms driving soil heterotrophic respiration-MAT relationships (e.g., carbon substrate availability). Our findings suggest that a warmer climate selects for microbial communities with higher CUE, as opposed to the often hypothesized reductions in CUE by warming based on soil laboratory assays. Our results help to build the impetus for, and confidence in, including microbial mechanisms in soil biogeochemical models used to forecast changes in global soil carbon stocks in response to warming.

We address this question using a mathematical model of dryland vegetation subjected to annual rainfall periodicity. We show that while spontaneous oscillations do not exist in realistic parameter ranges, resonant response to periodic precipitation is still possible due to the existence of damped oscillatory modes. Using multiple time-scale analysis, in a restricted parameter range, we find that these endogenous modes can be pumped by the exogenous precipitation forcing to form sustained oscillations. The oscillations amplitude shows a resonance peak that depends on model parameters representing species traits and mean annual precipitation. Extending the study to bistability ranges of uniform vegetation and bare soil, we investigate numerically the implications of resonant oscillations for ecosystem function. We consider trait parameters that represent species with damped oscillatory modes and species that lack such modes, and compare their behaviors. We find that the former are less resilient to droughts, suffer from larger declines in their biomass production as the precipitation amplitude is increased, and, in the presence of spatial disturbances, are likely to go through abrupt collapse to bare soil, rather than gradual, domino-like collapse.

Here, we investigated the effect of Zn on water absorption in the roots of maize (Zea mays L.), a crop which is sensitive to Zn deficiency, during water stress conditions. Seedlings of the maize variety "Zhengdan 958" were cultivated with 0.1 or 6 mu M ZnSO4 center dot 7H(2)O. To simulate drought stress, three-week-old seedlings were exposed to 15% polyethylene glycol (PEG). Root growth parameters, root antioxidant enzyme activity, root hydraulic conductivity, root aquaporin gene expression, root and leaf anatomy structure, leaf water potential, chlorophyll content, leaf area, and gas exchange parameters were measured. Under water stress, moderate Zn treatment promoted root growth; maintained root and leaf anatomy structural integrity. Moderate Zn significantly increased roots hydraulic conductivity (51%) and decreased roots antioxidant enzyme activity (POD: -11.1%, CAT: -35.1%, SOD: -3.1%) compared with low-level Zn under water stress. The expression of ZmPIP1;1, ZmPIP1;2, and ZmPIP2;2 was significantly higher with moderate Zn treatment than that of low-level Zn treatment. The leaf water potential, chlorophyll content, leaf area, and gas exchange parameters with moderate Zn treatment increased significantly under water stress compared with low-level Zn treatment. The moderate concentration of Zn improved root hydraulic conductivity in maize and increased resistance to simulated drought conditions by maintaining root structural integrity, decreasing antioxidant enzyme activity, and increasing aquaporin gene expression. Moderate Zn application increased root water absorption and leaf transpiration, thereby maintaining maize water balance under water stress conditions.

Based on GLEAM evapotranspiration products, meteorological stations and land use data, this study used slope trend analysis, Mann-Kendall (M-K) test and partial correlation analysis to analyse changes in evapotranspiration and water use in the YRB before and after reforestation from 1980 to 2019. The results showed that the annual average ET of the YRB from 1980 to 2019 ranged from 363 to 447 mm with an average change rate of 10.2 mm/10a. The actual evapotranspiration/potential evapotranspiration (ET/PET) growth rate of the YRB decreased after the Grain for Green Project (GGP), and the actual evapotranspiration/precipitation (ET/P) decreased extremely significantly. Water use efficiency in the YRB was significantly reduced, and grassland was subjected to greater water stress. This study provides scientific support for future water balance, landscape restoration, ecological protection and quality development of the YRB.																			1895-6572	1895-7455				2023 FEB 8	2023										10.1007/s11600-023-01034-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11600-023-01034-3		FEB 2023											WOS:000931336000001

As an important living skin of the soil, biocrusts strongly impact various soil properties and play a vital role in maintaining surface soil structure and multifunctionality. Although there are several studies concerning the effects of biocrusts on soil respiration processes, it is still not well un-derstood how biocrusts affect air permeability (Ka) and soil aeration in drylands. In a semiarid climate region of the northern Chinese Loess Plateau, the Ka and air-filled porosity (ea) of moss-dominated biocrusts established on aeolian sand and loess soil were measured as a function of soil water content under laboratory and in situ conditions and compared to measurements of bare soils. The relative air permeability (Kra) of biocrusts and bare soils was further analyzed and estimated with commonly applied Kra models that are based on the soil water retention curve (SWRC), and the performance of these models was specifically assessed for biocrusts. The in situ measurements yielded a 51.8% and 76.7% higher Ka for the biocrust-colonized aeolian sand and loess soil, respectively, when compared to the bare soils. Correspondingly, in comparison to the bare soils, the ea of the biocrusts also increased by 38.0% for the aeolian sand and by 52.4% for the loess soil. The laboratory mea-surements showed an 8.5%-9.3% increase of Ka for the biocrust-colonized soils from wet to dry conditions when compared to their bare counterparts, which was mainly attributed to their higher fine particle and organic matter contents as well as to the moss rhizoids. Moreover, a positive linear relationship (R2 > 0.43) was found between the log Ka and log ea for both biocrusts and bare soils. Additionally, the biocrusts exhibited higher water content at almost all matric potentials in comparison to the bare soils. The Kra of biocrusts was 22.0% higher for aeolian sand and 42.1% higher for loess soil when compared to the bare soils. The van Genuchten-Burdine and Brooks and Corey-Burdine models performed best with regard to the estimation of Kra (RMSE <= 0.100, bias <= 0.018). In general, biocrusts may greatly increase surface soil aeration due to their higher Ka and ea, and the soil aeration status of biocrusts can be indirectly assessed through their effective degree of soil water saturation. Our findings suggest that biocrusts should be carefully considered in further studies of soil aeration related to biological processes and gas and vapor transport in dryland ecosystems.					; Xiao, Bo/F-9722-2013	Tuller, Markus/0000-0003-3659-2768; Xiao, Bo/0000-0002-9544-4207													0341-8162	1872-6887				APR	2023	223								106942	10.1016/j.catena.2023.106942	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.106942		JAN 2023											WOS:000924681500001

Efficacy of risk reducing diversification portfolio strategies among agro-pastoralists in semi-arid area: A modern portfolio theory approach	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND FOOD RESEARCH												Agro-pastoralists in the tropical semi-arid dryland areas of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are significantly affected by climate change and variability. Agro-pastoral families are coping with production-related climatic risks through livelihood diversification to ensure food security. Data were collected from a sample of 411 agro-pastoralists across five districts in the semi-arid northern and central regions of Tanzania through a survey conducted between November 2017 and July 2018. Secondary data regarding crop yields and livestock populations for eight years from 2009 to 2017 were collected from the National Bureau of Statistics and the respective District offices. Results show that about three-quarters of the agro-pastoralists managed diversified crop and livestock portfolios with two or more crops and animal species. However, simulated crop yields reveal positive correlations. Construction of integrated portfolios that generate good returns at a modest risk can be achieved through strategic choices between high-return, high-risk and low-return, low-risk crop and livestock activities. Thus, the paper recommends costly long-term breeding and genotype improvement programs, strategically changing the make-up of the current crop and livestock portfolios, which appear to be an affordable and tailored solution for building risk resilience among agro-pastoral communities in the drylands.

Multiple Abiotic Stresses Applied Simultaneously Elicit Distinct Responses in Two Contrasting Rice Cultivars	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES												Rice crops are often subject to multiple abiotic stresses simultaneously in both natural and cultivated environments, resulting in yield reductions beyond those expected from single stress. We report physiological changes after a 4 day exposure to combined drought, salt and extreme temperature treatments, following a 2 day salinity pre-treatment in two rice genotypes-Nipponbare (a paddy rice) and IAC1131 (an upland landrace). Stomata closed after two days of combined stresses, causing intercellular CO2 concentrations and assimilation rates to diminish rapidly. Abscisic acid (ABA) levels increased at least five-fold but did not differ significantly between the genotypes. Tandem Mass Tag isotopic labelling quantitative proteomics revealed 6215 reproducibly identified proteins in mature leaves across the two genotypes and three time points (0, 2 and 4 days of stress). Of these, 987 were differentially expressed due to stress (cf. control plants), including 41 proteins that changed significantly in abundance in all stressed plants. Heat shock proteins, late embryogenesis abundant proteins and photosynthesis-related proteins were consistently responsive to stress in both Nipponbare and IAC1131. Remarkably, even after 2 days of stress there were almost six times fewer proteins differentially expressed in IAC1131 than Nipponbare. This contrast in the translational response to multiple stresses is consistent with the known tolerance of IAC1131 to dryland conditions.

Impacts of drought and native grass competition on buffelgrass (<i>Pennisetum ciliare</i>)	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Invasive species are detrimental to ecosystems worldwide, and long-term invasive treatment outcomes are generally poor. Integrating active restoration into an invasive species treatment plan by seeding with species that that can competitively suppress the invader may help to improve treatment outcomes. Buffelgrass is a drought tolerant perennial grass that is highly invasive and disruptive to dryland ecosystem biodiversity across the globe. In this greenhouse experiment, we examine how buffelgrass growth and traits were impacted by the combination of competition with eight native grasses species and water availability. We found that when buffelgrass was grown with species that establish rapidly and have large biomass, buffelgrass tends to exhibit rapid growth, despite becoming more drought stressed. Conversely, when buffelgrass was grown with species that are slow growing and conserve their size under drought conditions, buffelgrass biomass is arrested. The ability to adjust its strategy depending on its neighbor's strategy and on the amount of precipitation makes buffelgrass a robust invader. However, our results showed that growing buffelgrass with drought tolerant perennial grass neighbors reduced buffelgrass shoot biomass by up to 95% when grown in drought conditions. This indicates that seeding with native grasses after buffelgrass treatment is a beneficial option for suppressing re-invasion from the seedbank.

J	Stock, R				Stock, Ryan			Illuminant intersections: Injustice and inequality through electricity and water infrastructures at the Gujarat Solar Park in India	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE												Solar park development in India represents yet another frontier of capital accumulation under the auspices of climate change mitigation and rural electrification, producing new social frictions in the process. The decarbonization of India's electrical grid has put disproportionate burdens on marginalized populations, a trend particularly evident with the Gujarat Solar Park. Aside from solar arrays, it remains unclear how the vast infrastructures that sustain the Gujarat Solar Park will influence social power asymmetries at the local scale. For example, solar parks need periodic cleanings to function properly, requiring vast amounts of water. But dryland farmers from the region lack adequate water resources for irrigation and domestic purposes. Drawing on literature from feminist political ecology and critical infrastructure studies, this study investigates how the sociomaterial assemblage of water and electrical infrastructures of the Gujarat Solar Park unevenly distributes surreptitious burdens across differently positioned peasants. This study builds upon the conceptual frameworks of infrastructural violence and infrastructural intersectionality to illuminate the pernicious gender and caste politics of India's renewable energy transition. Solar infrastructures, built to ameliorate energy insecurity, may exacerbate water scarcity and pose additional threats to food security by grabbing arable land and denying marginalized smallholders engaged in food production near solar parks the water resources they need to feed themselves and the nation.

Metabolomic changes under drought stress conditions are largely unknown in alfalfa. Therefore, two alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) cultivars with contrasting tolerance to drought, namely the drought-tolerant Dryland "DT" and drought-sensitive WL343HQ "DS", were investigated to identify metabolic responses to drought stress. Both the tolerant and sensitive alfalfa showed significant differences in physiological levels under water-limiting conditions. The drought-tolerant cultivar DT sustained growth despite reduced water potential and photosynthesis, suggesting that the functioning of distinct metabolic pathways contributed to enhance tolerance. There were more differentially expressed metabolites produced by DT compared to DS under drought conditions. In addition, the drought-tolerant DT cultivar accumulated more tryptophanol, homocarnosine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, cytidine and clairol, which may be important metabolites for alfalfa drought tolerance. In addition, 17-Hydroxymethylethisterone with unknown function was a candidate tolerance metabolite, whereas the drought-sensitive cultivar DS produced reduced levels of lipid metabolites and increased levels of biosynthesis of amino acids. Among them, the up-regulated L-Proline, L-Arginine and L-Leucine were evident, supporting the conclusion that DS suffered more severe drought stress. This study provided new insights into the metabolic changes of alfalfa in drought stress conditions.																			0098-8472	1873-7307				MAR	2021	183								104329	10.1016/j.envexpbot.2020.104329	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2020.104329													WOS:000608802700001

The program regulates the proportion of land cover, but predictions about land cover changes were not considered. Therefore, in this study, we predict what the land cover may be in 2031 using the multi-layer perceptron neural network and the Markov chain methods. For this purpose, image composite, support vector machine classifier, and change detection were applied to a time series of satellite data. Visual validation showed the hot-spots of land cover changes related to population density, and statistical validation scored 0.99 and 0.78 in no information kappa and grid-cell level location kappa, respectively. The model was performed to predict land cover in 2031, and the predicted result was then compared with the spatial plan using an overlapping method. The results showed that built-up area, dryland agriculture, and wetland agriculture occupied two, twenty, and eight percent of the protected zone, respectively. Meanwhile, fifteen percent of the development zone was covered by forest, mainly in the eastern part of Mamminasata. The result can be used to help the Government decide future plans for the Mamminasata area.

Ben			A Three-Dimensional Assessment of Soil δ<SUP>13</SUP>C in a Subtropical Savanna: Implications for Vegetation Change and Soil Carbon Dynamics	SOIL SYSTEMS												Tree/shrub encroachment into drylands is a geographically widespread vegetation change that often modifies soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and dynamics, and represents an important yet uncertain aspect of the global carbon (C) cycle. We quantified spatial patterns of soil delta C-13 to 1.2 m depth in a subtropical savanna to evaluate the magnitude and timing of woody encroachment, and its impacts on SOC dynamics. Woody encroachment dramatically altered soil delta C-13 spatial patterns throughout the profile; values were lowest in the interiors of woody patches, increased towards the peripheries of those patches, and reached highest values in the surrounding grasslands. Soil delta C-13 and C-14 revealed this landscape was once dominated by C-4 grasses. However, a rapid vegetation change occurred during the past 100-200 years, characterized by (1) the formation and expansion of woody patches across this landscape, and (2) increased C-3 forb abundance within remnant grasslands. Tree/shrub encroachment has substantially increased SOC and the proportion of new SOC derived from C-3 plants in the SOC pool. These findings support the emerging perspective that vegetation in many dryland ecosystems is undergoing dramatic and rapid increases in SOC storage, with implications for the C cycle at regional and global scales.

However, uncertainties of several hundred years in age models make it difficult to distinguish synchronicity and feedbacks in paleo archives. In lakes this is often due to the lack of terrestrial macrofossils in climate-sensitive locations, such as high alpine or dryland settings. The potential of radiocarbon (C-14) dating of pollen has long been recognized, but the difficulty of cleanly separating pollen from other kinds of organic carbon has limited its usefulness. Here we report C-14 ages on pollen separated by flow cytometry, from a set of closely spaced samples from Mono Lake, California. The accuracy of the pollen ages is tested using well-dated bracketing tephras, the South Mono and North Mono-Inyo tephras. In spite of the purity of the sorted samples, the pollen dates are older than the bounding tephras by similar to 400 yr, similar to some other pollen-dating studies. While improvements in sample preparation protocols are planned, understanding the geological processes involved in the production, preservation, and deposition of pollen at each site will be critical to developing robust high-resolution age models.

A meta-analysis was conducted to determine how mulching improved tuber yield and NUE in potato and how yield and NUE is influenced by fertilization, tillage practices, and growing environment in China. A search of peer-reviewed publications was performed to collect data on the effects of mulching on yield and NUE in potato grown in China. The data included were from field studies with a mulching and a no mulching treatment and data on tuber yield and NUE. A total of 169 publications (17 in English and 152 in Chinese) containing 1802 observations from 105 sites were compiled into the dataset. Mulching significantly increased both tuber yield and NUE by an average of 24% compared to no mulching, respectively. Plastic film mulching was more effective in improving yield and NUE than straw mulching. The yield and NUE increase were highest under plastic film mulching on ridge-furrow plots and straw mulching on flat plots. Mulching was more effective at improving yield and NUE in the Northwest dryland region at a plant density between 55,000 and 70,000 plants ha(-1) and with application of synthetic N and P2O5 at rates of 100-200 kg ha(-1), K fertilization at 0-100 kg K2O ha(-1), and without organic fertilization. Integrated use of organic fertilizer and mulching was found to reduce synthetic N and P fertilizer input by 50% and K fertilizer input by 100% for production without affecting yield and NUE. These results demonstrate that mulching increases yield and NUE in potato in China, but the benefits occur when the growing region, tillage, and fertilization practices are appropriately considered.

However, mulch is an important source of feed for ruminant livestock. Accordingly, the trade-offs between mulching and stubble uptake by livestock are currently hot topics in the research field. In this study, a comparison between the quality of stubbles of wheat grown in notillage and conventional tillage fields and the rumen fermentation characteristics of Barbarine ewes grazing in the two fields was carried out. Samples were collected four times after wheat grain harvesting. Immediately after harvest, stubble biomass was slightly higher under no-tillage than conventional tillage. The ewes displayed different grazing behavior, with feeding at a higher rate on the conservative stubble than the conventional stubble. This feeding behavior seemed to be an adaptive strategy to offset the decline in the nutritional quality of stubbles from no-tillage-grown wheat. Indeed, dry matter, protein, fiber, and ash contents were lower in stubbles from no-tillage than conventional tillage at the second sampling time. Consequently, the concentration of the volatile fatty acid, propionic acid, was lower in ewes grazing in the conservative plots. However, this feeding behavior did not cause any body weight impairment during the two-month experimental period. At the end of grazing, the no-tillage practice was found to be comparable to the conventional tillage system according to the amount of residue remaining on the soil surface. Therefore, no-tillage could not be used to solve the competition between crops and livestock for residues.

J	Ma, L; Shao, MA; Li, TC				Ma, Li; Shao, Ming'an; Li, Tongchuan			Characteristics of Soil Moisture and Evaporation under the Activities of Earthworms in Typical Anthrosols in China	SUSTAINABILITY												Earthworms have an important influence on the terrestrial ecological environment. This study assesses the effect of different earthworm densities on soil water content (SWC) and evaporation in a laboratory experiment. Four earthworm densities (0 no-earthworm, control [C]; 207 earthworms m(-2), low density [LDE]; 345 earthworms m(-2), medium density [MDE]; and 690 earthworms m(-2), high density [HDE]) are tested in soil columns. Results show that cumulative evaporation occurs in the decreasing order of densities: C (98.6 mm) > LDE (115.8 mm) > MDE (118.4 mm) > HDE (124.6 mm). Compared with the control, earthworm activity decreases cumulative soil evaporation by 5.0-20.9%, increases soil temperature to 0.46 degrees C-0.63 degrees C at 8:00, and decreases soil temperature to 0.21 degrees C-0.52 degrees C at 14:00 on the soil surface. Temperature fluctuations reduce with increasing earthworm densities. A negative correlation is found between cumulative soil evaporation and earthworm density (R-2= 0.969,p< 0.001). Earthworms significantly (p< 0.05) decrease the surface SWC loss (0-20 cm) soil layer but increase the subsoil SWC loss (60-100 cm) by adjusting the soil temperature and reducing soil water evaporation. Earthworm activities (burrows, casts horizontal ellipsis ) improve the soil water holding ability by adjusting soil temperature and reducing soil water evaporation. Thus, the population quantity of earthworms may provide valuable ecosystem services in soil water and heat cycles to save water resources and realize sustainable agricultural development.																				2071-1050				AUG	2020	12	16							6603	10.3390/su12166603	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12166603													WOS:000578886200001

Quantifying sheet erosion rate on steep grassland could provide scientific support for effectively controlling soil erosion and rationally managing grassland. Simulated rainfall experiments were conducted on grassland plot with vegetation coverage of 40% under complete combination of rainfall intensities of 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 mm min(-1)and slope gradients of 7 degrees, 10 degrees, 15 degrees, 20 degrees and 25 degrees. Results showed that sheet erosion rate, varying from 0.0048 to 0.0578 kg m(-2) min(-1), was well described by binary power function equation (SE = 0.0026I(1.306)S(0.662)) containing rainfall intensity and slope gradient withR(2) = 0.940. The logarithmic equation of shear stress (SE = 0.084 + Ln (tau)) and the power function equation of stream power (SE = 1.141 & x277;(1.073)) could be used to predict sheet erosion rate. Stream power (R-2 = 0.903) was a better predictor of sheet erosion than shear stress (R-2 = 0.882). The stream power was an excellent hydrodynamic parameter for predicting sheet erosion rate. The study results can reveal the mechanism of sheet erosion process.

However, few studies have systematically evaluated the soil faunal community composition and N distribution and the relationships between them in different land use types in the Loess region of China. In this study, we assessed the correlation between these factors and their variation among three land use types: woodland, grassland, and abandoned land. The results revealed Formicidae (34.9%), Isopoda (26.1%), and Lumbricidae (11.2%) to be the dominant groups of soil fauna in the Loess area. The soil faunal community composition was related to both the soil and land use types (p < 0.05). The effects of different land use types on soil physicochemical properties change the community distribution of soil fauna, thus, affecting the role of soil faunae in the N cycle. The differences in soil organic matter, soil moisture content, and bulk density affect the composition of the soil faunal community. The diversity index of soil faunae in the three land use types was the highest in woodland (0.59?2.31) and the lowest in abandoned land (0.41?1.92). The contents of total N, nitrate N, ammonium N, and microbial biomass N were the highest in woodland followed by grassland and abandoned land. Redundancy analysis indicated significant positive correlations between individuals of Lumbricidae and NH4+-N, individuals of Stylommatophora and NO3? -N, individuals of Acariformes and total N, and individuals of Isoptera and microbial biomass N. Different land use types, therefore, alter the diversity and richness of the soil faunae in the Loess region, and the soil faunal community composition plays a significant role in promoting the content of different N forms in the soil environment.					lin, qing/JED-5250-2023; wu, yunhui/JGD-6838-2023														0929-1393	1873-0272				JUL	2021	163								103910	10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.103910	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.103910		FEB 2021											WOS:000647783900003

Thus, a 10-year experiment with three treatments, including no mulching (CK), gravel mulching (GM) and film mulching (FM), was established on the Loess Plateau. The results showed that SOC under GM treatment (7.88 g kg(-1)) in surface soil (0-20 cm) decreased significantly compared with that of CK (8.59 g kg(-1)), and that of FM (8.09 g kg(-1)) did not change significantly. Compared with CK in surface soil, water soluble C (WSC) under FM treatment decreased by 9.36% on average, and hot-water extractable C (HWC) under GM and FM treatments increased by 12.36% and 24.56% on average, respectively. Labile organic C (LOC) determined by the potassium permanganate (P-P) method did not decrease significantly under FM treatment in surface soil, but recalcitrant organic C (ROC), determined by the P-P method, significantly decreased by 9.88% on average. Compared with CK, less labile C (C-LL), determined by the modified Walkley-Black (M-W-B) method under GM and FM treatments, significantly decreased by 11.21% and 17.54% on average, respectively, which suggested that C-LL was converted to very labile C (C-VL) and labile C (C-L). This result indicated that the M-W-B method was superior in explaining C turnover. Combined with the C management index (CMI) results of previous studies, CMI was consistently lower under GM treatment, and it was unstable under FM treatment. The sensitivity index (SI) results indicated that HWC was the most sensitive SOC fraction, and LOC and ROC determined by the M-W-B method were more sensitive than those determined by the P-P method. Moreover, CMI calculated by the M-W-B method (10-35%) was more sensitive than that calculated by the P-P method (9-12%). In conclusion, the decrease in SOC under long-term mulching is mainly from ROC, and the M-W-B method is superior to the P-P method.

However, nowadays, there is still uncertainty regarding the mechanisms of flow resistance caused by dissimilar vegetation covers. To address this gap, a series of these was conducted in this study to investigate the influence of synthetic grass and stems on the variation of resistance on overland flows. Thirty vegetation configurations were selected (combining five synthetic grass coverage options and six synthetic stem coverage ones), and tested against five unit discharges (flow range = 0.28-2.22 L m(-1) s(-1)) and four slope gradients (3.49%-20.78%). The results obtained showed that the unit discharge is the key driving factor for the transition from laminar to transitional flow. Furthermore, the relationship between the resistance coefficient (f) and the Reynolds number (Re) was not monotonically increasing or decreasing, but behaviours observed were specifically linked to each vegetation coverage. However, a critical coverage threshold was identified, and it corresponded to 2.72% when the slope gradient tested was 3.49%. This threshold decreased with the increase of the slope gradient. In addition, when the vegetation coverage was less than the critical threshold, the f was negatively correlated with Re, otherwise if the vegetation coverage was higher than the critical threshold identified the f-Re relation was positively correlated. The total flow resistance under synthetic grass and stem cover was unequal to the linear superposition of grain resistance and form resistance caused by synthetic stem and grass, which meant that the linear superposition approach is not applicable to overland flows. Finally, a model was developed to predict the flow resistance by applying the pi-theorem and the multiple nonlinear regression analysis and it has been validated against the experimental results confirming its accuracy and high performance (adj.R-2 = 0.99, NSE = 0.94).

Remote sensing data-driven models have been successfully used to estimate carbon and water fluxes in various ecosystems, but the models are still underperforming in dryland. In this study, the agreement between the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, MODIS data-driven models, and the eddy covariance (EC) tower observation data were tested for two different ecosystem sites in arid regions in Xinjiang, China. The results convincingly indicated that the MODIS products can successfully capture the temporal GPP and ET variables for grasslands and shrublands, but these results have large biases. The MODIS GPP products certified contributed 88% of the EC observed GPP for the grassland but 16% for the shrubland. The temperature and greenness (TG) model clearly showed favourable correspondence with tower GPP observed in arid regions, with the coefficient of determination (R (2)) of 0.91 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 17.65 g C m(-2) 16 days(-1). The ET performance was evaluated at two sites, yielding R (2) values of 0.77 and 0.34 for the grassland and shrubland, respectively. Our study showed that the source of uncertainties comes from the remotely sensed data input in GPP and ET algorithms.

Plant regeneration from<i>Eucalyptus bosistoana</i>callus culture	IN VITRO CELLULAR & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY-PLANT												Eucalyptus bosistoanais an important durable hardwood species selected by New Zealand Dryland Forest Initiative (NZDFI) for their adaptability to diverse environments and good quality wood. There is no report onin vitromethods for callus induction and plantlet micropropagation of this species, although these methods could assist further genetic improvement of plants. In this study, different combinations of alpha-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) and benzyl adenine (BA) at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 2 mg L(-1)were investigated for callus induction, shoot regeneration, shoot elongation and root formation. High frequency of callus induction was obtained when cotyledon explants were cultured on MS (Murashige and Skoog medium 1962) with 1.0 mg L(-1)NAA and 1.5 mg L(-1)BA. For shoot regeneration from callus, MS medium with 0.5 mg L(-1)NAA and 1.5 mg L(-1)BA was an effective medium. Shoot elongation was observed on MS medium supplemented with 0.5 mg L(-1)NAA, 1.0 mg L(-1)BA and 1.0 mg L(-1)GA(3). High frequency of adventitious root formation in micro-cuttings ofE. bosistoanawas observed on half-strength MS medium with 0.5 to 1.0 mg L(-1)NAA. Finally, pre-acclimatization of the micropropagated plantlets led to 100% survival under glasshouse conditions.																			1054-5476	1475-2689				OCT	2020	56	5					718	725		10.1007/s11627-020-10093-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11627-020-10093-w		JUL 2020											WOS:000544838700002

Ichnodiversity and facies of Triassic red beds in the Irohalene area (Argana Basin, Western High Atlas, Morocco): implications for palaeoenvironment	HISTORICAL BIOLOGY												From Middle-Late Triassic continental deposits of the Timezgadiouine Formation (Argana Basin, Morocco), 17 lithofacies are identified, with alluvial fan, fluvial, floodplain and lacustrine associations. Invertebrate traces include Archaeonassa fossulata, Arenicolites isp., cf. Arenituba, Beaconites isp., cf. Camborygma, Cruziana problematica, Diplocraterion isp., Fuersichnus isp., Helminthoidichnites tenuis, Lockeia isp., Palaeophycus striatus, Palaeophycus tubularis, Planolites isp., Rusophycus carbonarius, Scoyenia gracilis, Skolithos isp., Spongeliomorpha carlsbergi, Taenidium isp. and Taenidium barretti. Additionally, rhizoliths were observed. Six ichnoassemblages were distinguished: overbank facies with (1) Rhizolith ichnoassemblage in a low-energy floodplain environment and (2) Scoyenia-Palaeophycus ichnoassemblage in crevasse splay deposits. The fluvial ichnoassociation is of moderate ichnodiversity consisting of the following assemblages: (3) Arenicolites, developed under higher flow velocities of active channels, (4) Taenidium-Scoyenia, formed by the colonisation of inactive channels, (5) Arenicolites-horizontal meniscate burrows, reflecting a rapid transition between active and abandoned channels and (6) Lockeia-vertebrate footprint, formed in littoral lakes. The Aglegal and Irohalene members indicate climatic shifts between arid dry, semiarid and subhumid in a dryland river environment. The sudden onset and the high frequency of lacustrine deposits in the lower Irohalene Member point to a rapid climate change from dry to intermittent wet and dry. This change is discussed in terms of the Carnian Pluvial Event.

Ascertaining Erosion Potential of Watersheds using Morphometric and Fuzzy-Analytical Hierarchy Processes: A Case Study of Agrani River Watershed, India	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA												The dryland watersheds are particularly vulnerable to degradation, especially by soil erosion. The morphometric indices of such river watersheds quantitatively describe the process of soil-erosion and development. Prioritizing such watersheds for the conservation of existing natural resources by identifying erosion risk areas is crucial for sustainable development. The present study proposes an effective multicriteria decision support model (MCDSM) known as the fuzzy analytical hierarchical process to identify and prioritize the erosion-prone sub-watersheds of the Agrani river. The methodology is developed by integrating the Fuzzy-AHP method, basin morphometric analysis and Geographic Information System (GIS). The ranks assigned to all sub-watershed using final score derived from the Fuzzy-AHP process. These sub-watersheds categorized into five levels of prioritization based on Fuzzy-AHP scores as very low, low, medium, high, and very high for the management and conservation of soil. The result illustrates that eleven sub-watersheds covering approximately 68.62% of the Agrani River watershed falls in the medium, high, and very high, erosion risk areas. The current research shows that the fuzzy-AHP model, drainage morphometry, and GIS approach can be effectively used in identifying and prioritizing crucial sub-watersheds for better management practices and conservation of natural resources.

J.; Mayor, Angeles G.; Rietkerk, Max; Baudena, Mara			More is not necessarily better: The role of cover and spatial organization of resource sinks in the restoration of patchy drylands	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												A low-cost restoration action in patchy drylands worldwide is the installation of obstructions (hereafter, resource sinks) to break runoff pathways and retain resources. Field-works have studied how the effectiveness of this action depends on the materials installed. However, the influence and effectiveness of the cover and spatial organization of resource sinks have not been widely investigated. In this work, we use a well-known dryland model to study how different initial cover and spatial organization of installed resource sinks affect the recovered ecosystem. In agreement with field-work studies, our results confirm that the installation of resource sinks can restore degraded drylands that would not recover naturally. More importantly, a very small cover of resource sinks was sufficient to trigger vegetation recovery, while a high cover would lead to complete failure. Higher plant densities were reached when distribution and cover were similar to that of spatial self-organized vegetation in the reference healthy system (i.e., regular spatial distribution in our study system). Given the effectiveness of low cover installations, suggested by our work, combined with the low-cost materials needed, resource sinks have the potential to be a key contributor to the large restoration efforts needed to achieve land-degradation neutrality, particularly in developing countries.

However, the roles of melatonin in mediating different stresses still need to be explored in different plants species and growth periods. To investigate the role of melatonin in mitigating salt stress, maize (Zea mays L.) seedlings growing in hydroponic solution were treated with 100 mM NaCl combined with or without 1 mu M melatonin. Melatonin application had no effects on maize growth under normal condition, while it moderately alleviated the NaCl-induced inhibition of plant growth. The leaf area, biomass, and photosynthesis of melatonin-treated plants were higher than that of without melatonin under NaCl treatment. The osmotic potential was lower, and the osmolyte contents (including sucrose and fructose) were higher in melatonin-treated plants. Meanwhile, the decreases in Na+ content and increases in K+/Na+ ratio were found in shoots of melatonin-applied plant under salt stress. Moreover, both enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant activities were significantly increased in leaves with melatonin application under salt treatment. These results clearly indicate that the exogenous melatonin-enhanced salt tolerance under short-term treatment could be ascribed to three aspects, including osmotic adjustment, ion balance, and alleviation of salt-induced oxidative stress.

This vulnerability is unequal, as it is mediated by biophysical and social factors. Implementing policies for climate resilience requires the ability to identify the farmers who are most vulnerable to extreme events like dry spells. We develop a novel approach by conceptualizing dry spell vulnerability in terms of monsoon crop water deficit at the farm scale. Using inputs of weather, terrain, soil properties, land-use-land-cover, crop properties, and a cadastral map, our tool models an hourly soil water balance at 30 m x 30 m resolution and maps the crop water deficit under rainfed conditions. This is a good indicator of the relative sensitivity of farmers to dry spells and allows prioritization of interventions within the focus region. Our tool, developed and deployed within the Maharashtra State Project on Climate-Resilient Agriculture, is iteratively calibrated and refined. We present the result of one such iteration in which 72% of cases were found to have an agreement between the modelled output and farmers' perception of dry spell-induced crop water stress. Our work demonstrates how vulnerability to climate hazards may be mapped at micro-scales to assist policymakers in targeting interventions in ecologically fragile regions with high rainfall variability.																			1366-7017	1996-9759				2023 JUL 19	2023										10.2166/wp.2023.036	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wp.2023.036		JUL 2023											WOS:001032436500001

A global meta-analysis	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												Cadmium (Cd) poses great threats to human health as a major contaminant in agricultural soil. Biochar shows great potential in the remediation of agricultural soil. However, it remains unclear whether the remediation effect of biochar on Cd pollution is affected by various cropping systems. Here, this study used 2007 paired observations from 227 peer-reviewed articles and employed hierarchical meta-analysis to investigate the response of three types of cropping systems to the remediation of Cd pollution by using biochar. As a result, biochar application significantly reduced the Cd content in soil, plant roots and edible parts of various cropping systems. The decrease in Cd level ranged from 24.9% to 45.0%. The feedstock, application rate, and pH of biochar as well as soil pH and cation exchange capacity were dominant factors for Cd remediation effect of biochar, and their relative importance all exceeded 37.4%. Lignocellulosic and herbal biochar were found to be suitable for all cropping systems, while the effects of manure, wood and biomass biochar were limited in cereal cropping systems. Furthermore, biochar exhibited a more long-lasting remediation effect on paddy soils than on dryland. This study provides new insights into the sustainable agricultural management of typical cropping systems.

However, while aeolian sediment dynamics are reasonably well understood, there is a lack of knowledge with regard to variability in the fluvial systems. Presented here are the findings from several locations within wadi drainage systems to the west of the Hajar Mountains (United Arab Emirates). The performance of optically stimulated luminescence dating using a customized standardized growth curve approach is investigated, showing that this approach allows reliable determination of ages by reducing the machine time required. Three main periods of fluvial activity occurred at 160-135, 43-34, and ca. 20 ka. Additional ages fall into the latest Pleistocene and Late Holocene. None of the ages coincides with major wet periods in SE Arabia that have been identified in stalagmites and by the deposition of lake sediments. It is shown that fluvial activity was partly contemporaneous (within the given time resolution) with phases of aeolian deposition and was almost continuous, but likely sporadic, during the Middle to Late Pleistocene. This highlights the need for regionally defined paleoenvironmental records to fully understand the response of dryland systems to long-term climatic change.

Overcoming barriers to knowledge sharing between land managers and researchers is a critical cross-sector strategy for engaging and mitigating or adapting to drought. Here we describe the establishment and functioning of the Pacific Drought Knowledge Exchange (PDKE), which provides users with easier access to: (1) sector- and geography-specific climate information; (2) better and more comprehensive information; (3) improved technical assistance; and (4) a more collaborative information-transfer environment through participation in knowledge co-production. We focus on our collaborative work with managers of important tropical dryland ecosystems from three distinct geographies to pilot the collaborative development of climate change, climate variability, and drought "portfolios" featuring site-specific historical and forecasted future information. This information was then used to collaboratively produce factsheets that partners used to: (i) better understand past and projected climate for specific management units; (ii) integrate new climate knowledge into management planning; and (iii) support climate-focused educational and outreach efforts. This pilot effort demonstrates the successful application of climate-focused co-production in dry tropical landscapes.

This study aims to determine the leaf temperature and sap flow of the pequi tree (Caryocar brasiliense Camb.), both with and without water restriction. Further, the leaf temperature was measured by infrared thermometry and estimated transpiration using the Granier method, where the thermal dissipation probes are inserted into the plant stems. The experiment was conducted in a 120-plant orchard located in Goiania-GO, Brazil, from which seven of the plants (3 irrigated and 4 non-irrigated; aged 6.6-7.4 years) were evaluated for eight months (October 2015 to May 2016). The soil was characterized as a dystrophic red latosol, and its water content was determined using the EC-5 capacitance sensors. The results denoted that the leaf temperature of the irrigated plants was lower than the median air temperature during summer and the transition period into the dry season, and the non-irrigated plants exhibited shortage of water availability during the dry season. In dryland conditions, the average transpiration was 24.09 L plant(-1) day(-1) and, when irrigated, became 42.29 L plant(-1) day(-1).

An understanding of factors that influence livelihood strategies adopted across rural households can further improve policy-making. This study identifies livelihood strategies adopted by smallholder farmers and the factors influencing the choice of their strategy. A structured questionnaire was administered to 400 randomly selected rural households from the Umzimkhulu and Ndwedwe local municipalities in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. Principal component analysis (PCA) and K-means cluster analysis were used to analyse the outcomes. The application of PCA on dummy variables depicting participation in livelihood activities reduced the number of dimensions. Next, PCA factor loadings served as input into K-means cluster analysis; K-means clusters represented household livelihood strategies. Multinomial logistic regression applied to the K-means clusters determined factors influencing the choice of livelihood strategies at the household level. The results indicate that years of formal education, household size, dependency ratio, arable dryland area accessed by the household, and savings of household heads, the location of the household and source of agricultural information were the main determinants of livelihood choice. These findings suggest that policymakers should design policies that are sensitive to household-level characteristics in promoting livelihood strategies.																			0303-1853	2078-0400				JUL 3	2019	58	3					340	353		10.1080/03031853.2019.1608275	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03031853.2019.1608275													WOS:000482341700005

While the political embrace of insurance has been cause for concern amongst those who fear insurance will undermine embedded coping mechanisms and moral economies, economists have puzzled over low insurance adoption rates amongst target populations. This article argues for an approach that scrutinizes insurance in relation to dynamic social practices and norms for responding to uncertainty. We employ this approach to investigate pastoralists' encounters with index-based livestock insurance in Northern Kenya and Southern Ethiopia. Drawing on interview, ethnographic, and survey data, we demonstrate how insurance is understood within larger moral economies and collective imaginaries for living with and managing uncertainty in the drylands. Relational understandings shape pastoralists' participation in risk-sharing arrangements, collective and individual decisions about livestock insurance purchase, and eventual uses of insurance payouts. Payouts also support a broad array of social reproductive purposes and investments in social and political life. As we conclude, these findings upset the binary between formal and informal insurance, revealing how "formal" index insurance must be negotiated with embedded social affiliations, rights, obligations, and understandings of uncertainty.																			0308-518X	1472-3409				NOV	2023	55	8					1928	1950		10.1177/0308518X231168396	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0308518X231168396		MAY 2023											WOS:001001288600001

Interregional trade not only transfers embodied land but also displaces the negative environmental impact of land degradation from one region to another. This study sheds light on land degradation transfer by focusing on salinization directly whereas previous studies have extensively assessed the land resource embodied in trade. To analyze the re-lationships among economies under interwoven embodied flows, this study integrates complex network analysis and input-output method to observe the endogenous structure of the transfer system. By focusing on irrigated land with higher crop yields than dryland farming, we make policy recommendations on food safety and proper irrigation. The results of the quantitative analysis show that the total amount of saline and sodic irrigated land embodied in global final demand are 260978.23 and 424291.05 square kilometers respectively. Salt-affected area of irrigated land is imported by not only developed countries but also large developing countries such as Mainland China and India. Exports of embodied salt-affected land in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan are pressing issues, accounting for nearly 60% of total exports from net exporters worldwide. It is also demonstrated that embodied transfer network has a basic community structure of three groups due to regional preference in agricultural products trade.

JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE												Increasing fresh water scarcity is a major constraint for rice (Oryza sativa) productivity under future climatic conditions. It is important to understand why rice cannot perform like other dryland cereals, when grown under drier soil conditions. The responses of plant growth, plant water status, leaf and stem anatomical attributes to soil water deficit were examined at two developmental stages of three rice and two wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars grown under three water regimes in a pot experiment. Yield and yield components were determined at plant maturity. The stress sensitivity of plant growth was slightly more prominent at vegetative than at flowering stages. Water deficit limited root growth but had little impact on above-ground growth in rice plants. The xylem system of the leaves was more developed in rice than in wheat, but the opposite was true for the root xylem system. Compared with stem xylem attributes, leaf xylem attributes played a larger role in modulating leaf water potential under water deficit. In addition, the variation in yield response to water deficit between various types of rice, and between rice and wheat was closely associated with the response of leaf water potential to water deficit.

We detail the use of a modified Hiltner dew balance to illustrate how more accurate measurements of dewfall may be obtained. Using a modified Hiltner dew balance, we measured dewfall in the Negev Desert continuously for 3 years (2013-2015). Data analyses examined the relationship between dew formation, rain events and other environmental parameters in order to re-evaluate the importance of dew in the water budget. In line with previous research, our findings demonstrate that dewfall is a substantial and stable input of water in the Negev desert, providing inputs in the dry summer and the wet winter. Our results show that while dewfall was larger and more prevalent in proximity to rain events, a notable portion of dewfall took place on days distant from any rain event. The Hiltner dew balance modifications proved to be reliable and increased the efficacy of measuring the quantity and timing of dew formation. This study demonstrates the importance of integrating dewfall data into decision-making models for dryland ecosystems and agriculture, as well as into climate models.

Short-term pain before long-term gain? Suppression of invasive primary prey temporarily increases predation on native lizards	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The control of invasive species can have cascading and at times undesirable effects on the wider ecological community. Effective management requires that the ecosystem-wide effects of removing invasive species be understood. We investigated the effects of large-scale rabbit control on the abundance (numerical response) and diet (functional response) of an invasive predator (ferret, Mustela putorius furo) that preys on rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), as well as the subsequent predation pressure experienced by alternative prey species (total response), in New Zealand's dryland habitats. Following rabbit control, ferret densities declined but surviving ferrets increased their per capita consumption of lizards and invertebrates, two key native prey groups. Rabbit control increased predation pressure on lizards, but reduced it on invertebrates. While rabbit control can negatively impact some groups of alternative prey up to 18 months post-control, it probably benefits them in the longer term because prey-switching by ferrets tended to reduce with time, and regeneration of vegetation previously over-grazed by rabbits is likely to reduce exposure of native prey to predation. While confirming these benefits will require longer-term monitoring, our results support management actions that limit short-term fluctuations in rabbit abundance and maintain them at low abundance.

It can be a seasonal adaptation in trees or the final stage in crops ensuring efficient translocation of nutrients to seeds. Along with developmental cues, various environmental factors could also trigger the onset of senescence through tran-scriptional cascades. Rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) is an important oil crop with its yielding affected by significant falling leaves as a result of leaf senescence, compared to many other crops. Therefore, a better understanding of leaf senescence and developing strategies controlling the progress of leaf senescence in rapeseed is necessary for warranting vegetable oil security. Here we functionally characterized the gene BnaNAM encoding No Apical Meristem (NAM) homologue to identify transcriptional regulation of leaf senescence in rapeseed. A combination of transient and stable expression techniques revealed overexpression of BnaNAM induced ROS production and leaf chlorosis. Quantitative evaluation of up-regulated genes in BnaNAM overexpression lines identified genes related to ROS production (RbohD, RbohF), proteases (beta VPE, gamma VPE, SAG12, SAG15), chlorophyll catabolism (PaO, PPH) and nucleic acid degradation (BFN1) as the putative downstream targets. A dual luciferase-based tran-scriptional activation assay of selected promoters further confirmed BnaNAM mediated transactivation of pro-moters of the downstream genes. Finally, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay further confirmed direct binding of BnaNAM to promoters of beta VPE, gamma VPE, SAG12, SAG15 and BFN1. Our results therefore demonstrate a novel role of BnaNAM in leaf senescence.

Understanding the effects of the conversion of cropland to apple orchards on soil water and nitrogen distributions, as well as the potential soil nitrate accumulation, is important and necessary. In this study, apple orchards (Red Fuji) of different growing ages (5, 15, and 28 year old), an abandoned apple orchard, a wheat field, and a maize field in Changwu County of the Loess Plateau were selected to evaluate the soil water content (SWC), nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N), and other soil parameters within the 0-5 m soil depth. Results showed that SWC of maize field (21.22%) was the highest, followed by that of the 5-years-old apple orchard (20.24%) and wheat field (18.83%). The SWC of the 28-years-old apple orchard (16.09%) was the lowest of the six treatments. Soil NO3--N storage within the 0-5 m soil profile under 5-, 15-, and 28-years-old, abandoned apple orchards, wheat fields, and maize fields reached approximately 613.2, 1929.4, 4277.9, 1282.4, 95.2, 275.9 kg ha 1, respectively. The SWC deficits were found severe, and high nitrate accumulation was found in 15-and 28 years-old apple orchards. Soil water deficits and nitrate accumulation in abandoned apple orchards can persist for ten years. The soil NO3--N content was significantly (P < 0.01) negatively correlated with SWC. After converting croplands to apple orchards, soil water deficit and nitrate accumulation were the main soil environmental problems, which worsened with age. A reasonable amount of fertilizer should be applied in orchards to reduce contaminants in the soil environment. Coupling enhancement of the utilization efficiency of fertilizers and limited soil water resources could be important for establishing the soil environment in arid and semi-arid areas.

Here, we used an elevation gradient that covered six elevation levels and ranged from 1308 to 2600 m above sea level. Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and ITS-1 gene was used to analyze the community of bacteria, total fungi, ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi, and saprotrophic fungi in both rhizosphere and bulk soil; in addition, the soil enzyme activity (beta-glucosidase, N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, leucine aminopeptidase, and acid phosphatase) was investigated. The results revealed that the elevation significantly affected the diversity of the bacterial, total fungal, EcM, and saprotrophic fungal community, as well as the enzyme activity dynamics. The difference in the microbial diversity and enzyme activity between rhizosphere and bulk soil diminished as the elevation increased, except for the saprotrophic fungal diversity. Similarly, the dominant phyla from the compositions of bacteria, fungi, EcM fungi, and saprotrophic fungi, such as Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Basidiomycota, and Ascomycota, also changed with elevation and rhizosphere. In addition, the elevation-dependent differences in the microbial community and enzyme activity between the rhizosphere and bulk soil were affected mainly by climatic factors (mean annual temperature and precipitation) and soil properties, such as the bulk density, ammonium nitrogen, and total phosphorus. The effects of the climatic factors were greater than those of the soil properties along the elevation gradient. These results suggest that changes in climatic factors, such as temperature, with elevation may affect the microbial interaction between roots and the soil. The result highlight the importance of the ecological roles of the microbial community in climate change.

Bacteria play an important role in litter decomposition, especially late in the decomposition process, when they become abundant. In this paper, we investigate bacterial community composition and diversity during about 1year of Quercus wutaishanica litter decomposition using a molecular approach, to fill the gaps in knowledge about bacterial communities during decomposition. The results showed that the phyla Proteobacteria (Alpha and Betaproteobacteria), Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Acidobacteria were the most dominant throughout the experiment. As decomposition progressed, a dynamic succession of community and diversity was observed for different decomposition periods. Decay stages and seasonal shifts occurred by successful replacement of copiotrophic bacterial groups such as Betaproteobacteria in the early stage. During the entire process of decomposition, litter decomposition selectively stimulated the relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria (Sphingomonas, Rhizobium, and Methylobacterium) and Bacteroidetes, but reduced the abundance of Massilia (Betaproteobacteria), Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Among the abiotic factors, litter N and P content was the main factor driving the succession of litter bacteria. These results indicate the changes in decomposition stages in terms of the bacterial groups and elucidate the microbial community underpinnings of nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.																			0168-2563	1573-515X				JUL	2019	144	2					119	131		10.1007/s10533-019-00575-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-019-00575-4													WOS:000476495100001

An often-overlooked aspect of agroforestry projects for carbon sequestration is their impact on water resources. It is often unclear to what extent the establishment of forest vegetation would be limited by water availability, whether it would engender competition with other local water uses or induce water scarcity. Here we use global water models to study the hydrologic constraints and impacts of afforestation in tropical biomes. We find that 36% of total suitable and available afforestation areas are in areas where the rain alone can meet just up to the 40% of total plant water requirement. Planting trees will substantially increase water scarcity and possible dispossession (green water grab) especially in dryland regions of Africa and Oceania. Moreover, the combination of tree restoration and irrigation expansion to rainfed agricultural areas is expected to further exacerbate water scarcity, with about half of the global suitable areas for tree restoration experiencing water scarcity at least 7 months per year. Thus, the unavailability of water can overall limit climate change adaptation strategies.This article is part of the theme issue 'Ecological complexity and the biosphere: the next 30 years'.

J	Ingram, SE; Patrick, SM				Ingram, Scott E.; Patrick, Shelby M.			Human securities, sustainability, and migration in the ancient US Southwest and Mexican Northwest	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY												In the U.S. Southwest and Mexican Northwest region, arid-lands agriculturalists practiced sedentary agriculture for at least four thousand years. People developed diverse lifeways and a repertoire of successful dryland strategies that resemble those of some small-scale agriculturalists today. A multi-millennial trajectory of variable population growth ended during the early 1300s CE and by the late 1400s population levels in the region declined by about one-half. Here we show, through a meta-analysis of sub-regional archaeological studies, the spatial distribution, intensity, and variation in social and environmental conditions throughout the region prior to depopulation. We also find that as these conditions, identified as human insecurities by the UN Development Programme, worsened, the speed of depopulation increased. Although these conditions have been documented within some sub-regions, the aggregate weight and distribution of these insecurities throughout the Southwest/Northwest region were previously unrecognized. Population decline was not the result of a single disturbance, such as drought, to the regional system; it was a spatially patterned, multi-generational decline in human security. Results support the UN's emphasis on increasing human security as a pathway toward sustainable development and lessening forced migration. Through these results and the approach demonstrated here, we aim to stimulate collaborations between archaeologists and others in service of modern sustainability planning.																			1708-3087					JUN	2021	26	2							9	10.5751/ES-12312-260209	http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ES-12312-260209													WOS:000668219400016

Effects of imidacloprid seed treatments on crop yields and economic returns of cereal crops	CROP PROTECTION												In the Pacific Northwest United States, cereal crops (barley, oats, wheat) are the foundation of most dryland crop rotations. Nearly 100% of cereal producers use neonicotinoid seed treatments to manage wireworms, regardless of crop and pest density. However, wireworms cause variable damage to different crops, and whether neonicotinoids boost yield and economic returns across crops remains largely unknown. In a field experiment conducted on one commercial farm over two years, we examined effects of imidacloprid seed treatments on wireworm density, yield, and economic returns for barley, oat, and wheat crops. Wheat plots with imidacloprid seed treatments produced greater yields and economic returns over costs than untreated plots, even though wireworm densities were largely unaffected by treatments. However, no differences in yield and economic returns were observed between treatments in barley or oats. Wireworm densities were markedly lower in oats compared to barley and wheat, indicating not all crops provided a permissive environment for wireworms. Our results support the hypothesis that growers may benefit from moving away from applying seed treatments in all cereal crops, but rather targeting management to specific crops, although research at more commercial farm sites remains needed to test the generality of this conclusion. Our results also support the hypothesis that incorporating more tolerant cereal crops (barley and oats) into rotations to replace spring wheat may be a promising option for growers in areas with high wireworm pressure.

Diagnosis of soil hydrophobicity linked to pig slurry use in a calcareous soil	SPANISH JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Pig slurry fertilization in dryland agriculture of semiarid areas is a matter of concern because of the increasing intensity of livestock farming. Slurry is a nutrient source but if it triggers soil water repellency (SWR), this could constrain its application over the surface in the crop cycle. In SWR tests, choice of a suitable drying soil temperature is a key point, as temperature affects its expression. Its determination must also be easily integrated with the different standard analytical procedures in laboratories. In this study we evaluated the persistence and the severity of the SWR in undisturbed soil samples dried at 40 degrees C. Soil samples came from a long-term fertilization experiment where five slurry treatments plus a control were implemented. Soil samples were taken seven times during a 51 days (d) period, starting 4 d before slurry application and up to 47 d after. The maximum recorded SWR persistence and severity was classified as moderate and severe, respectively. As soil dried at 40 degrees C was able to express hydrophobicity after pig slurry fertilization, the SWR tests can be easily included in the framework of routine procedures for soil sample analysis where this effluent has been applied. Further research is needed in slurry rainfed fertilized areas to evaluate SWR variability (annual and between cropping seasons) and its additional impacts in these agricultural systems.

Eight populations of C. rotundus from different ecozones in the Punjab were investigated to evaluate morphological, anatomical and physiological response to soil and environmental conditions. Anatomical characteristics are strongly responsive to environmental conditions. C. rotundus is well adapted to environmental heterogeneity, i.e., agricultural fields, dryland salinity, salt marshes, and desert and semi-desert climates. Its ecological success is because of plasticity in structural and functional features to adapt to different environmental conditions and water conservation via storage parenchyma, wide xylem vessels for conduction of solutes, sclerenchyma and stomatal features for minimizing water loss. Populations from drier habitats showed intensive sclerification in root vascular region, large metaxylem vessels, vascular area and stomatal density. Population from salt marsh had high accumulation of free proline, free amino acids, Ca2+ and aerenchyma formation in roots and stem, vascular bundle area and number in stem, thicker leaves and well-developed bulliform cells. C. rotundus populations showed high degree of plasticity in morpho-anatomical and physio-biochemical characteristics, which provide this species a great potential to acquire a variety of habitats. Each population showed specific modifications regarding morpho-anatomical and physiological characteristics, which indicated its adaptability potential to a specific environmental condition.

C.			Carbon versus nitrogen release from root and leaf litter is modulated by litter position and plant functional type	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Litters of leaves and roots of different qualities occur naturally above- and below-ground, respectively, where they decompose in contrasting abiotic and biotic environments. Therefore, ecosystem carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics can be strongly affected by the combination of litter position and quality. However, it is poorly understood how C versus N turnover of litters depend on the interplay among plant functional type (PFT), organs, traits and litter position. In a semi-arid inland dune, soil surface and buried leaf litters and buried fine roots of 25 species across three PFTs (herbs, legume shrubs and nonlegume shrubs) were incubated for 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months to investigate litter decomposition and C and N dynamics. Morphological and chemical (nutrient and NMR carbon) traits of initial litters of leaves and fine roots were determined. The litter decomposition rates (k values) of surface leaves and buried fine roots did not differ, but buried fine roots and buried leaf litter decomposed faster than surface leaf litter. Ratios of k values of surface leaves to buried leaves decreased with leaf C:N ratio. Herbs and legume shrubs decomposed faster than nonlegume shrubs for buried fine roots, but not for leaves. At given C loss, buried fine roots had higher N loss than leaf litters; legume shrubs with relatively higher N or lower C:N ratio had higher N loss than nonlegume shrubs. Stronger positive relationships between C and N losses were shown in leaves and legume shrubs than in fine roots and nonlegume shrubs respectively. Synthesis. The generality of faster N release of legume litters at given C release highlights the importance of legumes in N cycling in semi-arid ecosystems where N is the limiting factor. The dynamics and coordination of C versus N release as a function of litter quality are modulated by litter position and PFT. These findings have important implications for the development of process-based models on C and N cycles in the context of on-going global change potentially altering the functional composition of plant communities and the relative quantities and qualities of above-ground versus below-ground litter.

However, knowledge remains limited about how the production and diversity of plants and soil physicochemical parameters drive changes in soil microbial activity (such as microbial biomass, respiration, and enzyme activity) after cropland abandonment. Here, we investigated a grassland restoration chronosequence (0-30 years) to determine the dynamics of soil microbial biomass, respiration, and enzyme activity in the Loess Hilly, Region (China). Overall, cropland abandonment caused an increase in soil microbial activity primarily in the 0-20 cm soil layers. The metabolic quotient in the 0-10 cm layer decreased linearly with time since abandonment (recovery years). Structural equation models showed that recovery years directly and indirectly affected changes to soil microbial activity. Plant species richness, aboveground biomass, and soil organic carbon explained a large proportion of the variability in soil microbial activity in the 0-20 cm layer. However, the variability in soil microbial activity was mostly explained by plant species richness, belowground biomass, and soil total nitrogen in the 20-50 cm layers. Our results indicate that during recovery after cropland abandonment, changes in soil microbial activity are driven by plant characteristics and soil physicochemical parameters, with different drivers at different soil depths.

Nevertheless, few studies focused on the effects of the shifts in vegetation composition on Ks of alpine grassland ecosystems. This study examined the effects of normal alpine meadow transition into shrub and severely degraded meadow stages on Ks and further qualified the driving processes. The results showed that the divergent shift of normal alpine meadows altered the soil and meadow properties. Soil water retention and storage capacity of the topsoil was reduced due to the divergent shift of the normal meadow transition into shrub meadow or severely degraded meadow. Ks and field moisture capacity (FMC) reduced by 73.1% and 64.9% in the 0-10 cm soil layer during the transition from normal to degraded meadow, while their variation in the 0-10 cm soil layer were not significant but water consumption increased during the shift from normal to shrub meadow. At the state of normal alpine meadow shift toward severely degraded meadow, the dominant factors affecting Ks were meadow cover (MC), root mass density (RMD), clay content and total porosity, with total effect coefficients of 0.48, 0.42, 0.39 and 0.69, respectively. Meanwhile, when normal alpine meadow shift toward shrub meadow, dominant factors affecting Ks were MC, non-capillary porosity, clay and sand contents, with total effect coefficients of 0.47,-0.86,-0.54 and-0.50, respectively. This study helps understanding the impacts of the shifts in vegetation composition on the ecohydrological processes in alpine meadow ecosystems in response to climate change and overgrazing.

Households' livelihood strategies within small-scale irrigation schemes have become increasingly complex and diversified. Strategies consist of farm income from rain-fed and irrigated cropping as well as livestock and an increasing dependence on off-farm income. The success of these strategies depends on the household's ability to make decisions about how to utilize its' financial, labour, land and water resources. This study explores the dynamics of decision-making in households on-farm household income within six small-scale irrigation schemes, across three southern African countries. Household survey data (n = 402) was analyzed using ordered probit and ordinary least squares regression. Focus group discussions and field observations provided qualitative data on decision-making in the six schemes. We found strong support for the notion that decision-making dynamics strongly influence total household income. Households make trade-offs between irrigation, dryland, livestock and off-farm work when they allocate their labour resources to maximize household income; as opposed to maximizing the income from any individual component of their livelihood strategy, such as irrigation. Combined with the impact of the small plot size of irrigated land, this is likely to result in sub-optimal benefits from expensive investments in irrigation infrastructure. Policy-makers must consider this when developing and implementing new policies.

J	Hu, YB; Chen, BD				Hu, Yanbo; Chen, Baodong			Arbuscular mycorrhiza induced putrescine degradation into γ-aminobutyric acid, malic acid accumulation, and improvement of nitrogen assimilation in roots of water-stressed maize plants	MYCORRHIZA												Water shortage limits plant growth and development by inducing physiological and metabolic disorders, while arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis can improve plant adaptation to drought stress by altering some metabolic and signaling pathways. In this study, root growth and levels of some metabolites (polyamines, amino acids, and malic acid [MA]) and key enzymes were examined in AM-inoculated and non-inoculated (NM) maize seedlings under different water conditions. The results showed that AM symbiosis stimulated root growth and the accumulation of putrescine (Put) during initial plant growth. Root Put concentration significantly decreased in AM compared with NM plants under water stress; correspondingly, Put degradation via diamine oxidase into gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) occurred. Moreover, glutamine concentration and the activity of N assimilation enzymes (nitrate reductase and glutamine synthetase) were higher in roots of AM than NM plants under moderate water stress. The activity of GABA transaminase and malic enzyme, and MA concentration were also higher in roots of AM than NM plants under moderate water stress. Our results indicated that Put catabolism along with improved N assimilation and the accumulation of GABA and MA were the key metabolic processes in roots of AM maize plants in response to water stress.

However, the effects of in-tegrated slope engineering measures (fish scale pits (a semicircle-shaped pit), infiltration holes, organic fertilizer) on runoff utilization, nutrient restoration and vegetation growth are not well known. This study combined rainwater infiltration and nutrient recharge (RINR), and evaluated the effect of RINR on soil water, organic carbon, total nitrogen storage and vegetation growth in a field experiment in slope artificial forestland (David peach, Prunus davidiana Franch) one year later (from 2018 to 2019). Four treatments: (1) rainwater infiltration and nutrient recharge (RINR) system (fish scale pit + infiltration hole + hole filling with 30% organic fertilizer and 70% surface loess, PHF treatment), (2) fish scale pit + infiltration hole + filling surface loess (PH treatment), (3) pure fish scale pit (P treatment) and (4) natural slope land (control, SL treatment, CK). The results showed that, compared with the control (162 mm), PHF, PH and P treatments increased the soil water storage of 0-100 cm soil layer by 37 mm, 76 mm and 30 mm, respectively. The RINR system (PHF treatment) had a significantly higher restoration effect of SOC and STN value than other treatments in all soil profiles (0-100 cm), especially at 40 cm. Compared with the control (2.42 kg/m2, 0.28 kg/m2), the RINR system 0-40 cm soil layer soil organic carbon storage increased by 320%, and total nitrogen storage increased by 129%. Meanwhile, changes in height of tree (David peach), crown width and annual branch length under RINR system increased by 0.18 m, 0.30 m and 0.33 m, respectively. Overall, the RINR system is an effective approach for enhancing the growth of degraded revegetation. This system is conducive to mitigating the water and nutrient scarcity and maintaining the persistence of vegetation restoration in arid and semi-arid areas with shallowly buried soft bedrock.

A three-year experiment was conducted to explore the responses of tuber yield, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, net global warming potential (NGWP), carbon footprint (CF), and net ecosystem economic budget (NEEB) of rainfed potato to two mulching practices [plastic film mulching (RM) and no plastic film mulching (NM)] and three urea types [conventional urea (U), controlled-release urea (C), and a mixture of equal amounts of conventional urea and controlled-release urea at a ratio of 1:1 (CU)] and their interactions. The results showed that RM significantly decreased cumulative N2O emissions and CH4 uptake by 4.9% and 28.4%, but significantly increased NGWP by 8.9% relative to NM. Compared with U, the C and CU produced much lower cumulative N2O emissions and NGWP and higher CH4 uptake. The interaction of mulching methods and urea type had significant influence on tuber yield and NEEB. Considering both environment and production, RMCU could not only achieve a high tuber yield and NEEB (by up to 26.5% and 42.9%, respectively), but also reduce the CF (by up to 13.7%), and therefore should be considered an effective strategy for dryland potato.

J	Esteves, MJ				Jose Esteves, Matias			The Agrarian Park in the planning of urban sprawl in drylands: the case of Guaymallen, Mendoza (Argentina)	REVISTA DE URBANISMO												The urban sprawl on rural lands generates urban-rural interface areas, characterized by the loss of historical agricultural activities and ecosystem services, spatial fragmentation, and social segregation due to how the new neighborhoods materialize. In a dryland ecosystem with limited availability of natural assets, it is essential to plan the growth of the city growth over fertile land. The objective is to investigate the figure of the agrarian park for the protection and enhancement of agricultural territories and its articulation with new residential uses. To do this, primary and secondary sources of information were analyzed along with semi-structured interviews with local actors and direct observation in fieldwork based on a case of study: the department of Guaymallen, in the province of Mendoza (Argentina). The characteristics of the case are analyzed through the analysis of the cultural landscape, and the articulation between natural and cultural factors generates a singular landscape in the urban-rural interface. The agrarian park allows the expression of social, economic, and environmental benefits for protecting and enhancing agricultural landscapes and creating complementary activities for residential uses that are established nearby. The conclusions indicate that the figure of the agrarian park is adequate to rescue the characteristics of the varied agricultural territories, besides ensuring the interaction between different uses and actors to achieve local development.

The Growth Response of Pasture Brome (<i>Bromus</i> <i>valdivianus</i> Phil.) to Defoliation Frequency under Two Soil-Water Restriction Levels	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Pasture brome (Bromus valdivianus Phil.) has the potential to increase current levels of herbage production and pasture persistence in New Zealand dryland, well-drained soils. However, there is little literature on the effect of defoliation management on growth of this grass under contrasting soil-water restriction levels. The growth physiology and performance of pasture brome were evaluated in pots in a glasshouse. Defoliation frequency (DF) treatments were applied based on three different accumulated growing degree-days (AGDD): 250, 500 and 1000 AGDD (high, medium, and low DF). At end of the first growing cycle (1000 AGDD), water availability was restricted to 20-25% of field capacity (FC) in half of the pots, while the other pots were maintained between 80-85% FC. Total accumulated herbage mass was positively related with the low DF and well-watered conditions (p < 0.05). At the final harvest, plants subjected to low DF had greater root mass than high and medium DF (p < 0.05). At each harvest, the leaf regrowth stage (LS) for low DF was 3.5, while for high and medium DF, the LS was 1.5 and 2.0; respectively. Tiller water-soluble carbohydrates were highest at the low DF and under 20-25% FC. Regardless of soil-water conditions, defoliation at 3.5 LS supports production, enhancing survival during a drought.

SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Production of phosphorus efficient genotypes in groundnut can improve and also reduces environmental pollution. Identification of P-efficient groundnut genotypes is a need of the hour to sustain in P-deficient soils. The pot experiment showed significant differences between genotypes (G) and treatments (T) for all the traits and G x T interaction for majority of traits. The G x T x Y interaction effects were also significant for all the traits except leaf P% (LP%), leaf acid phosphatase (LAP) and root dry weight (RDW). In lysimeter experiment, the effect of G, T and G x T were significant for leaf dry weight (LDW), stem dry weight (SDW), total transpiration (TT) and transpiration efficiency (TE). For traits, LDW, SDW, TT, TE, ICGV 00351 and ICGS 76; for SDW, TT, ICGV 02266 are best performers under both P-sufficient and deficient conditions. Based on P-efficiency indices and surrogate traits of P-uptake, ICGV's 02266, 05155, 00308, 06040 and 06146 were considered as efficient P-responding genotypes. From GGE biplot, ICGV 06146 under P-deficient and TAG 24 under both P-sufficient and deficient conditions are portrayed as best performer. ICGV 06146 was identified as stable pod yielder and a promising genotype for P-deficient soils. The genotypes identified in this study can be used as a parent in developing mapping population to decipher the genetics and to devleop groundnut breeding lines suitable to P-deficient soils.

This study aimed to determine erosion hazard classification and erosion hazard map using Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) as the basis of a soil and water conservation planning program. The RUSLE model was used to assess soil loss and guide the soil conservation efforts. Annual rainfall data, digital elevation model (DEM), land use map were used to generate the RUSLE parameters, namely rainfall-runoff erosivity factor (R), soil erodibility factor (K), slope length and steepness factor (LS), cover-management factor (C), and support practices factor (P). Erosion hazard is classified into five classes, namely very low, low, medium, high, and very high. On the basis of the results, at the Dolago watershed, very high erosion hazard was found in dryland of 577.95 t/ha/yr. Meanwhile, very low erosion hazard was found in the rice field of 2.22 t/ha/yr. The results help in planning and implementing soil and water conservation, both vegetatively and mechanically, to minimize the damage to watershed ecosystems. Validation and testing of the RUSLE model should be carried out in future studies because this is a strategic step to develop modeling of sediment yields effectively in an effort to mitigate major land damage in watersheds.

How future precipitation (rainfall vs snowfall) change will impact aboveground net primary production (ANPP) is far from clear, especially when combined with increasing N availability. Methods In this study, we investigated changes in community productivity, abundance and aboveground biomass of two dominant plant functional groups (PFGs), i.e. perennial rhizome grasses (PR) and perennial bunchgrasses (PB) under the impacts of increased precipitation (rainfall vs snowfall) combined with N addition in a semiarid temperate steppe. Important Findings Summer rainfall augmentation marginally increased community ANPP, whereas it significantly increased the abundance and aboveground biomass of PR, but not those of PB. Summer rainfall addition increased the fraction of PR biomass (f(PR)) while decreased that of PB (f(PB)). Spring snow addition had no effect on aboveground biomass of either compositional PFG although it marginally increased community ANPP. Nitrogen addition significantly increased community ANPP with greater increase in PR under summer rainfall addition, indicating strong interactive effects on community ANPP largely by enhancing PR biomass. We also found a nonlinear increase in the positive effect of nitrogen addition on productivity with the increased precipitation amount. These findings indicate an amplified impact of precipitation increase on grassland productivity under the accelerated atmospheric N deposition in the future.

Development and Use of a Planter for Simultaneous Application of Seed, Fertilizer and Compost in Pearl Millet Production in Niger - Effects on Labor Use, Yield and Economic Return	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Sowing and application of mineral and organic fertilizer is generally done manually in the Sahel, resulting in low precision and delayed application. The objective of this paper is to present a new mechanical planter (Gangaria) for the combined application of seeds and soil amendments (mineral fertilizer, compost, etc.), and to assess the effects of using this planter in pearl millet on labor use, yield and economic return. The labor study showed that the mechanized application of seeds and compost reduced time use by a factor of more than six. The on-station experiments were completely randomized experiments with six replications and six treatments: T0 (control), T1 (0.3 g NPK hill(-1)), T2 (25 g compost hill(-1)), T3 (25 g compost + 0.3 g NPK hill(-1)), T4 (50 g compost hill(-1)) and T5 (50 g compost + 0.3 g NPK hill(-1)). Treatments T1 to T5 were sown by the planter with seeds that were primed in combination with coating of seeds with a fungicide/insecticide. The treatment T5 increased grain yield and economic return compared to the control by 113% and 106%, respectively. The advantages for farmers using this approach of agricultural intensification are timelier sowing of dryland cereal crops, easy application of organic fertilizer and more precise delivery of input, thereby making this cropping system more productive and less vulnerable to drought.

ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE												The use of superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) in dryland agricultural areas utilizing brackish irrigation water is a strategy to increase plant available water (AW). However, water retention by SAPs may be adversely affected under salinity. SAP containing calcium carbonate (Ca-SAP) is considered to be more resistant and provide more plant AW under saline conditions compared to conventional SAP (C-SAP) and to control. This research investigated two replicated lettuce trials to evaluate three treatments (Ca-SAP, C-SAP and control) subjected to irrigation water with electrical conductivities of 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 dS m(-1). Both SAP treatments increased AW by an average of 0.16 m(3) m(-3) as compared to the control. Decrease in AW with salinity was lower in Ca-SAP (0.07 m(3) m(-3)) as compared with C-SAP (0.13 m(3) m(-3)). Lettuce fresh weight (g plant(-1)) was higher for Ca-SAP (22.9) as compared to C-SAP (16.4), however, did not differ from control (20.6). As water salinity increased, lettuce fresh biomass was higher in Ca-SAP as compared to C-SAP up to 2 dS m(-1) with no significant differences from control. The Ca-SAP is less affected by salts than the C-SAP, although its use did not benefit lettuce growth under saline conditions as expected.

J	Rosas, JC; Korenaga, J				Rosas, Juan Carlos; Korenaga, Jun			Archaean seafloors shallowed with age due to radiogenic heating in the mantle	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												Given the scarcity of geological data, knowledge of Earth's landscape during the Archaean eon is limited. Although the continental crust may have been as massive as present by 4 Gyr ago, the extent to which it was submerged or exposed is unclear. One key component in understanding the amount of exposed landmasses in the early Earth is the evolution of the oceanic lithosphere. Whereas the present-day oceanic lithosphere subsides as it ages, based on numerical models of mantle convection we find that higher internal heating due to a larger concentration of radioactive isotopes in the Archaean mantle halted subsidence, possibly inducing seafloor shallowing before 2.5 Gyr ago. In such a scenario, exposed landmasses in the form of volcanic islands and resurfaced seamounts or oceanic plateaus can remain subaerial for extended periods of time, and may have provided the only stable patches of dryland in the Archaean. Our results therefore permit a re-evaluation of possible locations for the origin of life, as they provide support to an existing hypothesis that suggests that life had its origins on land rather than in an oceanic environment.

Although surface runoff may transport microplastic off-site, infiltration may also facilitate microplastic transport from surface soil to deeper depths. Microplastic comprises a relatively new category of soil contaminants, whose transport in the soil has not yet been widely studied. In this study, we investigated microplastic transport from contaminated surface soil (50 g kg-1) driven by irrigation, from permanent wilting point to saturation, and developed an empirical model to characterize the resulting accumulation of microplastic along soil profile. A soil column experiment was conducted under various treatments: the control, 1, 2 and 4 runs of irrigation. Soil samples were collected from inside and outside of soil cracks (if present) in each soil layer (0-2 cm (source layer), 2-5 cm, 5-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-30 cm, 30-40 cm, 40-50 cm). The results showed that with increasing irrigation runs, microplastic in the source soil layer decreased, while microplastic contents in deeper soil depths increased significantly (p < 0.05), varying from 7.03 g kg-1 in 2-5 cm to 0.29 g kg-1 in 40-50 cm soil. The microplastic content detected in soil cracks was 1.3-17.8 times higher than that detected in the soil matrix at similar depths, indicating that the transported microplastic is prone to be enriched in soil cracks. In addition, the total amount of transported microplastic increased 1.5 times after four irrigation runs, and the variations were significantly observed especially at deeper soil depths. Based on correlation analyses, data-fitted empirical models that relate cumulative microplastic to the depth of soil layer and irrigation runs indicate that irrigation -facilitated microplastic transport could be well-characterized (R2 >0.92). Further research is needed to develop an physical-based model in order to assess microplastic migration risks driven by irrigation and other agricultural management practices.					wang, qi/ITT-9652-2023	Tang, Darrell/0000-0002-4743-3976; Yang, Xiaomei/0000-0002-5199-7889													0147-6513	1090-2414				DEC 1	2022	247								114232	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.114232	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.114232		OCT 2022						36308877					WOS:000877580300009
J	Sun, DZ; Liang, YJ; Peng, SZ				Sun Dingzhao; Liang Youjia; Peng Shouzhang			Scenario simulation of water retention services under land use/cover and climate changes: a case study of the Loess Plateau, China	JOURNAL OF ARID LAND												Comprehensive assessments of ecosystem services in environments under the influences of human activities and climate change are critical for sustainable regional ecosystem management. Therefore, integrated interdisciplinary modelling has become a major focus of ecosystem service assessment. In this study, we established a model that integrates land use/cover change (LUCC), climate change, and water retention services to evaluate the spatial and temporal variations of water retention services in the Loess Plateau of China in the historical period (2000-2015) and in the future (2020-2050). An improved Markov-Cellular Automata (Markov-CA) model was used to simulate land use/land cover patterns, and ArcGIS 10.2 software was used to simulate and assess water retention services from 2000 to 2050 under six combined scenarios, including three land use/land cover scenarios (historical scenario (HS), ecological protection scenario (EPS), and urban expansion scenario (UES)) and two climate change scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, where RCP is the representative concentration pathway). LUCCs in the historical period (2000-2015) and in the future (2020-2050) are dominated by transformations among agricultural land, urban land and grassland. Urban land under UES increased significantly by 0.63x10(3) km(2)/a, which was higher than the increase of urban land under HS and EPS. In the Loess Plateau, water yield decreased by 17.20x10(6) mm and water retention increased by 0.09x10(6) mm in the historical period (2000-2015), especially in the Interior drainage zone and its surrounding areas. In the future (2020-2050), the pixel means of water yield is higher under RCP4.5 scenario (96.63 mm) than under RCP8.5 scenario (95.46 mm), and the pixel means of water retention is higher under RCP4.5 scenario (1.95 mm) than under RCP8.5 scenario (1.38 mm). RCP4.5-EPS shows the highest total water retention capacity on the plateau scale among the six combined scenarios, with the value of 1.27x10(6) mm. Ecological restoration projects in the Loess Plateau have enhanced soil and water retention. However, more attention needs to be paid not only to the simultaneous increase in water retention services and evapotranspiration but also to the type and layout of restored vegetation. Furthermore, urbanization needs to be controlled to prevent uncontrollable LUCCs and climate change. Our findings provide reference data for the regional water and land resources management and the sustainable development of socio-ecological systems in the Loess Plateau under LUCC and climate change scenarios.

PLANT JOURNAL												Structural chromosome variations (SCVs) are large-scale genomic variations that can be detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). SCVs have played important roles in the genome evolution of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), but little is known about their genetic effects. In this study, a total of 543 wheat accessions from the Chinese wheat mini-core collection and the Shanxi Province wheat collection were used for chromosome analysis using oligonucleotide probe multiplex FISH. A total of 139 SCVs including translocations, pericentric inversions, presence/absence variations (PAVs), and copy number variations (CNVs) in heterochromatin were identified at 230 loci. The distribution frequency of SCVs varied between ecological regions and between landraces and modern cultivars. Structural analysis using SCVs as markers clearly divided the landraces and modern cultivars into different groups. There are very clear instances illustrating alien introgression and wide application of foreign germplasms improved the chromosome diversity of Chinese modern wheat cultivars. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 29 SCVs associated with 12 phenotypic traits, and five (RT4AS center dot 4AL-1DS/1DL center dot 1DS-4AL, Mg2A-3, Mr3B-10, Mr7B-13, and Mr4A-7) of them were further validated using a doubled haploid population and advanced sib-lines, implying the potential value of these SCVs. Importantly, the number of favored SCVs that were associated with agronomic trait improvement was significantly higher in modern cultivars compared to landraces, indicating positive selection in wheat breeding. This study demonstrates the significant effects of SCVs during wheat breeding and provides an efficient method of mining favored SCVs in wheat and other crops.

The availability of whole genome sequences can facilitate the development of high marker density and predict gene content in genomic segments of interest. Correlations between genetic and physical positions of these loci require handling of different experimental genetic data types, and ultimately converting them into positioning markers using a routine and efficient tool. Results: To convert classical QTL markers into KASP assay primers, KASPspoon simulates a PCR by running an approximate-match searching analysis on user-entered primer pairs against the provided sequences, and then comparing in vitro and in silico PCR results. KASPspoon reports amplimers close to or adjoining genes/SNPs/simple sequence repeats and those that are shared between in vitro and in silico PCR results to select the most appropriate amplimers for gene discovery. KASPspoon compares physical and genetic maps, and reports the primer set genome coverage for PCR-walking. KASPspoon could be used to design KASP assay primers to convert QTL acquired by classical molecular markers into high-throughput genotyping assays and to provide major SNP resource for the dissection of genotypic and phenotypic variation. In addition to human-readable output files, KASPspoon creates Circos configurations that illustrate different in silico and in vitro results.

Functional trait is more strongly related to ecological processes than taxonomic diversity and reflects ecosystem functioning and species responses to environmental changes. In this study, we selected five habitats that differ in degree of disturbance to explore the effects of land use on ant community compositions, traits distributions and functional diversity change. We assessed how habitat disturbance affects the ant community compositions and traits distributions and asked if ant functional diversity respond to disturbance at the local scale?Location: Luchun County, Yunnan Province, southwest China.Methods: Pitfall traps were used to survey ant communities. Additionally, we measured four ant morphological traits (eyes diameter, distance between eyes, femur length of the hind-leg and Weber's length) to assess the functional traits distributions and functional diversity. Shade plot of ant relative abundance was used to explore species distribution amongst different habitats. Kernel density plot was used to explore ant traits distribution patterns amongst different habitats. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling ordination, based on ant Weber's length, was used to explore the ant traits compositions amongst different habitats. The fourth corner model was used to evaluate the association between ant traits and environmental variables. The FRic, RaoQ and FEve indices were selected as three complementary measures of the multivariate functional traits space and functional redundancy of different habitats.Results: We collected 14258 ants, representing 89 species, 40 genera and seven subfamilies. Aphaenogaster schurri and Tetramorium ciliatum were the common species of secondary forest; P. sagei, P. pieli, Cardiocondyla wroughtonii, Recurvidris nuwa, Tapinnoma melanocephalum, Monomorium pharaonis and M. orientale were the common species in plantations; and Iridomyrmex anceps and Cardiocondyla nuda were the common species in managed farms. Ants had medium eye diameters, narrow distances between eyes, medium leg lengths and smaller body sizes in greatly-disturbed habitats; and ants had an increasing eye diameter and narrowing of the space between eyes, while the leg length and Weber's length became shorter in moderately-disturbed habitats. Ant trait composition, based on Weber's length, showed significantly differences amongst five habitats. The fourth corner analysis indicated that ant species traits were significantly correlated with environmental variables. The functional diversity of secondary forest, lac plantation and lac plantation-corn agroforest were higher than those in dryland farm and rice paddy. Functional diversities were significantly negatively correlated with bare ground cover and significantly positively correlated with leaf-litter cover, leaf-litter thickness and plant cover.Main conclusion: Our results indicated that ant traits distribution patterns were affected by land-use changes, followed by anthropogenic disturbance pressures at the local scale. Ant traits compositions in greatly-disturbed habitats also differed from the habitats with less disturbance. It is unfavourable for the survival of the large body-size ants in more open habitats with more anthropogenic disturbance. Compared with secondary forest, dryland farm and rice paddies were less resistant and more vulnerable and lac plantations had approximately functional diversity of ant communities, suggesting that lac plantations might be resistant as secondary forest to species loss.

Ecohydrological influences of biocrusts and their pathways in a desert steppe ecosystem	ECOHYDROLOGY												Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are a prevalent form of organic cover in drylands across the world, and they play a crucial role in shaping the ecohydrological processes and functioning of dryland ecosystems. However, in desert steppe ecosystems, the ecohydrological influences of biocrusts and their pathways have not yet been thoroughly understood. Here, we examined the influences of three types of biocrusts (cyanobacterial, cyanobacterial-moss mixed, and moss biocrusts) on soil water retention and infiltration in a typical desert steppe of northwestern China, and we also analysed the possible pathways through which biocrusts affect them. Accordingly, the field capacity (theta f, indicating soil water-holding capacity) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks, indicating soil infiltrability) of each biocrust-covered soil and bare soil were measured both at 0-5 and 5-10 cm depths, on Arenosols (loamy sand texture) and Calcisols (silty loamy texture), respectively. Our results showed that the presence of biocrusts increased surface soil (0-5 cm) water-holding capacity while decreased soil infiltrability, creating a remarkable impact on soil water retention and infiltration. As compared to bare soil, the theta f of cyanobacterial, cyanobacterial-moss mixed, and moss biocrusts were increased by 16.5%, 21.4%, and 21.7% on Arenosols and by 9.6%, 18.9%, and 22.8% on Calcisols, while their Ks were reduced by 43.2%, 56.2%, and 38.2% on Arenosols, and by 49.0%, 68.7%, and 36.0% on Calcisols, respectively. The development of biocrusts on sandy textured soil had a more pronounced impact on both soil water retention and infiltration than loamy textured soil. We found that biocrusts mainly changed soil water retention and infiltration by increasing the contents of clay and organic matter. More specifically, the increase in clay content led to a more significant effect compared to the increase in organic matter content on Arenosols, while the opposite influence was observed on Calcisols. Among the three types of biocrusts, the soil infiltrability of the mixed biocrusts was the lowest, perhaps due to the interaction between the accumulation of clay particles by moss and the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances by cyanobacteria. Our study highlights the remarkable ecohydrological impacts of biocrusts on desert steppe ecosystems, and the results imply that it is of great necessary to integrate biocrusts and their influences into our understanding of ecohydrological processes in global drylands.																			1936-0584	1936-0592				DEC	2023	16	8							e2581	10.1002/eco.2581	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.2581													WOS:001126778600014
J	Peng, B; Zhang, JW; Xing, J; Liu, JQ				Peng, Bo; Zhang, Jiawei; Xing, Jian; Liu, Jiuqing			Online moisture measurement of dead fine fuel on the forest floor using near-infrared reflectometry	REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS												A method for online measurement of the levels of moisture in dead fine fuels on the forest floor is proposed based on near-infrared reflectometry. A linear relationship is found between the moisture content of dead fine fuels and the intensity of light absorption at a wavelength of 1450 nm, and this forms the basic principle of measurement for different forest species. An online moisture-monitoring device is designed and developed based on this principle. This uses long-distance wireless data-transmission to adapt to the lack of telecoms service in remote forests. Moisture-measurement experiments were conducted continuously for 24 h in rainless weather during the summer of 2019 in the Harbin Urban Forestry Demonstration Base of Northeast Forestry University using leaves from four different forest species, specifically, larch, dryland willow, silver birch, and walnut. These measurements were verified using simultaneous measurements employing a weighing method. The results from the field experiments agreed well with the weighing results. The uncertainty in the moisture-content measurements using the proposed system was similar to 3.4% when the true moisture content was 20.0% or less. This proposed system has the advantages of online measurement and high accuracy. This method for monitoring moisture levels in dead fine fuels is an important advance in terms of improving the accuracy and simultaneity of measurements for prediction of forest-fire-risk ratings and fire behavior.																			0034-6748	1089-7623				JUN 1	2021	92	6							065103	10.1063/5.0041221	http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/5.0041221								34243528					WOS:000684399900002

P. BEAUV. EX ROEM. & SCHULT. SUBSP. <i>FUSCA</i>	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												A study was conducted to evaluate structural and functional modifications in Diplachne fusca roots under varying regimes of salt stress. Differently adapted populations were collected from ecologically different regions in the Punjab region namely Pakka Anna (hypersaline dryland), Sahianwala (saline waterlogged area), Kalar Kahar (hypersaline salt marsh), Rahimyar Khan (saline sandy loam) and Treemu (saline seasonal inundation). The plants were grown in normal non-saline condition at the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad for 6 months to acclimatize them in the Faisalabad conditions. Three salt stress levels were maintained thereafter, i.e., 0, 200 and 400 mM NaCl for 90 days. All populations responded differently to increasing salt levels. The Pakka Anna population was found to be the most tolerant which relied mainly on increased K+ uptake but maintained Ca2+ uptake in root. An increase in root cross-sectional area was also observed in this population due to increase in storage parenchyma and vascular tissues. This appeared to be crucial towards water conservation in this population. The Sahianwala population collected from saline waterlogged area ranked second in salt tolerance. The notable anatomical modifications in this population included increased vascular tissue and aerenchymatous formation for efficient translocation of nutrients and gaseous exchange especially under anaerobic conditions. It was concluded that differently adapted populations evolved distinctly in geographically isolated regions by development of specific root anatomical features.

There exists a widespread misunderstanding that the concentrations of microplastics might be the determinant affecting the diversity and assembly of soil bacterial communities, rather than their shapes. Here, we examined the variations of soil bacteria community composition and functioning under two-year field incubation by four shapes (ball, fiber, fragment and powder) of microplastics along the concentration gradients (0.01%, 0.1% and 1%). Data showed that specific surface area of microplastics was significantly positively correlated with the variations of bacterial community abundance and diversity (r=0.505, p<0.05). The fragment- and fiber-shape microplastics displayed more pronounced interfacial continuity with soil particles and induced greater soil bacterial alpha-diversity, relative to the powder- and ball-shape ones. Strikingly, microplastic concentrations were not significantly correlated with bacterial community indices (r=0.079, p>0.05). Based on the variations of the beta NTI, bacterial community assembly actually followed both stochastic and deterministic processes, and microplastic shapes significantly modified soil biogeochemical cycle and ecological functions. Therefore, the shapes of microplastics, rather than the concentration, significantly affected soil bacterial community assembly, in association with microplastic-soilwater interfaces.

Red brome (Bromus madritensis ssp. rubens; "B. rubens" hereafter) is one of the most rapidly spreading invasive plants in California. Here, we experimentally tested the independent and joint effects of B. rubens competition and water availability on the establishment, survival, and per capita biomass of three native forb species common to California drylands. In a controlled greenhouse setting, five watering regimes ranging from extreme dry to extreme wet were introduced through controlled watering every 10 days, and B. rubens competition was introduced by growing native plants either in the presence or absence of B. rubens. Bromus rubens did not impact the establishment or survival of any of the three native forbs but did negatively influence the per capita biomass of two of the three native species. Competitive effects did not vary with water availability, suggesting that the negative effects of B. rubens on native competitors may depend more upon species identity than soil moisture conditions in California drylands. We suggest that the native forb Phacelia tancetifolia may be useful in restoration plantings [in areas affected by B. rubens] because this native species maintained consistent biomass across the range of watering levels tested and regardless of B. rubens presence.

Under such conditions, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) may improve plant stress resistance by increasing water and nutrient uptake but their diversity and community in dryland agroecosystems remains underexplored. The objective of this study was to investigate the AMF species diversity and community associated with five economically relevant crops (alfalfa, pepper, maize, onion and walnut) grown in an arid zone of northern Mexico. DNA was extracted and PCR-amplified with AMF specific primers from root and rhizosphere soil samples. Libraries were constructed and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq system; representative sequences were assigned to 30 species in 12 genera. AMF community composition was similar among the crops but significantly different between the roots and the rhizosphere soil. A strong dominance, in terms of DNA sequence read abundance of Septoglomus sp. was found in root samples. On the contrary, in rhizosphere soil Rhizophagus spp. and Funneliformis mosseae were more abundant. Most of the Septoglomus sequences were affiliated to a node in-between the branches of the species S. viscosum and S. titan, indicating an undescribed or uncharacterized highly abundant species in this ecosystem. Describing and understanding plant associated AMF communities in drylands may provide valuable information for future tailored made inocula efforts.

Land use status of Daye Lake basin in 2019 has been shown by Landsat 8 OLI image, water quality of Daye Lake, and 12 inflowing rivers have been investigated once a month; this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the water pollution characteristics of the inflowing rivers and lake in the basin under different LULC patterns, and providing a reference for the scientific planning of land-use types in the basin and land use research in lake basins in subtropical areas. Pollutants are mainly introduced to Daye Lake from the west (such as Da Gang) and north (such as Linjiaju Gang), with concentrations gradually decreasing within the lake from west to east. Construction land is closely associated with the total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), permanganate index (CODMn), and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) inputs to the basin, which can be trapped by vegetation. Agricultural dryland can contribute acid and dissolved oxygen (DO) to water. Precipitation can influence the input of pollutants, with a stronger effect on TN and weaker effect on TP. Pollutants accumulate from the inlets to the centre of the lake, with longer retention times during the dry season.

Using panel data for five regions from the period 2000-2016, we analyzed the relationships between crop yield and two climatic variables (temperature and precipitation) for three major Algerian rainfed cereals: durum wheat, common wheat, and barley. The Mann-Kendall test was applied to assess the significance and magnitude of yield trends, and pooled OLS regression was employed to analyze the determinants of the variability in cereal yields. Results showed that the rainfed cereal yields in this zone are highly variable; that the minimum temperature and average annual precipitation strongly influence cereal yield differentials, with an observed cumulative (lagged) effect; and that the maximum temperature has no direct (or lagged) effect (i.e., its effect on the yield is not statistically significant). The findings of this study also suggest that, despite significant regional differences in semiarid environments, advances in the production technology used in cereal farming have had consistent effects on the yield stability-increasing yields of common wheat but barely influencing yields of durum wheat and barley. These are important findings for the rainfed cereal sector of Algerian dryland agriculture, as they permit a better understanding of the impacts of climate change on Algerian agriculture.

A Preliminary Investigation into the Feasibility of Gin Blending	JOURNAL OF COTTON SCIENCE												The biggest discounts to the grower are for grade, length and micronaire. Since round modules do not blend cotton from multiple parts of a field as conventional modules did, some round modules may fall below base grade. This study was initiated as a preliminary evaluation to determine the effect of gin blending on fiber, yarn and fabric processing performance and quality and the potential economic return to the grower. One lot of irrigated and dryland stripper-harvested seed cotton, with different pre-determined micronaire and length properties, were blended together in four different ratios (80/20%, 60/40%, 40/60% and 20/80%) at the gin and at the textile mill. The resulting two cottons and four blends were carded, ring spun, knitted, scoured, bleached and dyed. Based on the 2016 CCC loan schedule, gin blending can benefit the grower with the biggest economic benefit, about $5 per bale, obtained from the 80/20 and 60/40 blend ratios when using seed cotton with these particular qualities from this one-year study. Processing performance and yarn and fabric quality of the gin blended product were not different from that of the unblended cotton and the mill blended fiber, indicating no serious consequences associated with gin blending, cotton with this micronaire and length range, to the spinner.																			1523-6919	1524-3303					2019	23	1					97	108																WOS:000504897100012

The uneven distribution of cultivated land and water resources will threaten national food security. In this study, we adopt the Gini coefficient and water-land matching coefficient for exploring the water-land nexus in the main grain-producing areas of North China Plain (NCP) from 2000 to 2020. The water-land-food nexus considering grain crop production structure is further explored from spatial and temporal multi-scales. The results show the following: (1) The Gini coefficient presents an increasing trend in the NCP, indicating an increasing imbalance in the water-land matching degree among inter-regions. (2) There are significant differences in the WL nexus and WLF nexus among regions, showing a spatial pattern of "worse in the north and better in the south". (3) The cities which belonged to the low WL-low WLF and high WL-low WLF should be considered as key targets when formulating policies. (4) Adjusting the wheat-maize biannual system, optimizing the grain cultivation structure, promoting semi-dryland farming, and developing low water-consuming and high-yielding crop varieties are essential measures for these regions. The research results provide significant reference for the optimal management and sustainable agricultural development of agricultural land and water resources in NCP.

Ecosystem-scale water-use strategy is increasingly recognized as a key factor in regulating drought-related ecosystem responses. However, the link between water-use strategy and ecosystem vulnerability to meteorological droughts is poorly established. Using the global flux observations, historic hydroclimatic data, remote-sensing products, and plant functional-trait archive, we identified potentially vulnerable ecosystems, examining how ecosystem water-use strategy, quantified by the percentage bias (delta) of the empirical canopy conductance sensitivity to VPD relative to the theoretical value, mediated ecosystem responses to droughts. We found that prevailing soil water availability substantially impacted delta in dryland regions where ecosystems with insufficient soil moisture usually showed conservative water-use strategy, while ecosystems in humid regions exhibited more pronounced climatic adaptability. Hyposensitive and hypersensitive ecosystems, classified based on delta falling below or above the theoretical sensitivity, respectively, achieved similar net ecosystem productivity during droughts, employing different structural and functional strategies. However, hyposensitive ecosystems, risking their hydraulic system with a permissive water-use strategy, were unable to recover from droughts as quickly as hypersensitive ones. Our findings highlight that processed-based models predicting current functions and future performance of vegetation should account for the greater vulnerability of hyposensitive ecosystems to intensifying atmospheric and soil droughts.

J	Allen, H; Karstens, S; Littleton, J				Allen, Harry; Karstens, Sarah; Littleton, Judith			Legacy archaeology: Aboriginal subsistence response to Holocene environmental changes using faunal evidence from archaeological sites on the Lower Murray, South Australia	HOLOCENE												Ngaut Ngaut (Devon Downs) and Tungawa (Fromm's Landing) 2 and 6 are located in the Gorge Section of the Lower Murray River. They were excavated more than 60 years ago. Unusually, they preserved fauna over the 6000 or 7000 years of occupation. Assessing this record, it is concluded that Aboriginal agents were responsible for the middens in these rockshelters. Following this, Ngaut Ngaut and the Tungawa sites are compared in terms of their dating, stratigraphy and changes in the fauna through time. While the majority of species are present throughout at all three sites, there are shifts in the number of animals in concert with Holocene environmental changes. After 3000 BP, the trend is to increased attention being given to resources from the riparian and river zones and away from the dryland Murray Plains. An increase in shellfish and the presence of crayfish gastroliths support this contention. Nearby Tartanga Island provides a record of Holocene sedimentary changes in the Murray River associated with altered sea level and flood regimes, particularly the deposition of the Monoman and Coonambidgal formations. The latter creating a landscape of highly productive swamps and backwaters. The information from these legacy excavations supports the conclusion that a shift in the locus of Aboriginal hunting and gathering activities accompanied mid- and late-Holocene environmental changes on the Lower Murray River.

The role of superficial geology in controlling groundwater recharge in the weathered crystalline basement of semi-arid Tanzania	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Little Kinyasungwe River Catchment, central semi-arid Tanzania. Study focus: The structure and hydraulic properties of superficial geology can play a crucial role in controlling groundwater recharge in drylands. However, the pathways by which groundwater recharge occurs and their sensitivity to environmental change remain poorly resolved. Geophysical surveys using Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) were conducted in the study region and used to delineate shallow subsurface stratigraphy in conjunction with borehole logs. Based on these results, a series of local-scale conceptual hydrogeological models was produced and collated to generate a 3D conceptual model of groundwater recharge to the wellfield. New hydrological insights for the region: We propose that configurations of superficial geology control groundwater recharge in dryland settings as follows: 1) superficial sand deposits act as collectors and stores that slowly feed recharge into zones of active faulting; 2) these fault zones provide permeable pathways enabling greater recharge to occur; 3) 'windows' within layers of smectitic clay that underlie ephemeral streams may provide pathways for focused recharge via transmission losses; and 4) overbank flooding during high intensity precipitation events increases the probability of activating such permeable pathways. These conceptual models provide a physical basis to improve numerical models of groundwater recharge in drylands, and a conceptual framework to evaluate strategies (e.g., Managed Aquifer Recharge) to artificially enhance the availability of groundwater resources in these regions.

Pastoralists are engaging and embracing a range of adaptive strategies to adjust to these changes. The socioeconomic factors driving them to engage in a portfolio of multiple adaptation strategies have not been adequately addressed in the existing literature. A multivariate probit model was used to analyze them as determinants of adaptive capacity that promotes or hinders adaptation to climate change. Adaptation is represented by uptake of multiple strategies (irrigation, livestock migration, fodder production, and improved livestock breeds) by households, a demonstration of a household's ability to diversify and adapt to the effects of climate change. The household asset base, particularly social capital represented by government assistance, stands out as it positively influenced by the uptake of four out of five adaptation strategies; that is, irrigation, livestock manure, fodder production, and improved breeds. Information heavily supports the adaptation process as it influenced all the five adaptation strategies analyzed but has a heterogeneous effect, supporting households to either adopt or reject a strategy. Crop-based information positively determines uptake of yield-enhancing strategies while relevant information for livestock activities contributes to the uptake of livestock-based strategies. These findings suggest that mainstreaming agricultural innovations, building a household asset base, and facilitating access to agronomic and climatic information will enable dryland communities to better adapt to climate change.																			0165-0009	1573-1480				AUG	2020	161	3					393	413		10.1007/s10584-020-02696-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-020-02696-4		APR 2020											WOS:000528077200001

Indoor rainfall experiments were conducted in 2 rainfall intensities (90 mmh(-1) and 120 mmh(-1)), four slope gradients (17.60%, 26.80%, 36.40%, 46.60%) and 2 slope lengths (5 m, 10 m). Erosion processes are divided into five stages. Results show that sediment yield is mainly sourced from rill erosion, contributing from 54.60% to 95.70% and the duration of which is extended by slope gradients. Sediment load and sediment concentration are significantly different along erosion stages, with the highest values in rill development stage (S-IV). Surface flow velocities (interrill and rill) demonstrate less significant differences along erosion stages. Rainfall intensity increases sediment load in all stages, with up to 12.0 times higher when changing from 90 to 120 mmh(-1). There is an increasing trend for sediment load and sediment concentration with the rising slope gradient, however, fluctuations existed with the lowest values on 26.80% and 36.40%, respectively, among different treatments. The slope gradient effects are enhanced by rainfall intensity and slope length. Results from this study are important for validating and improving hillslope erosion modelling at each erosion stage.					yang, xihua/AAD-9855-2022; wu, jun/ISB-8607-2023; Fang, Haiyan/H-3947-2015; Zhou, John L./E-7610-2011	Zhou, John L./0000-0003-1393-1608													1009-637X	1861-9568				JUN	2019	29	6					1001	1020		10.1007/s11442-019-1641-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11442-019-1641-y													WOS:000471039300010

The objective of this study was to explore the roles of the 'enzyme latch' and 'Fe gate' mechanisms in regulating soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in a rice-wheat cropping system subjected to six fertilization treatments: control (CT), chemical fertilizer (CF), CF plus manure (CFM), CF plus straw (CFS), CF plus manure and straw (CFMS), and CF plus organic-inorganic compound fertilizer (OICF). Soil samples were collected after the rice and wheat harvests and wet sieved into large macroaggregates, small macroaggregates, microaggregates, and silt and clay particles. Variations in amorphous and free Fe oxides, Febound organic carbon and phenol oxidase activity were examined. After nine years, compared with the initial soil, the activation degree of free Fe oxides increased by 1.3- to 1.6-fold and the topsoil SOC stock increased by 13-61% across all treatments. Amorphous Fe oxide content, phenol oxidase activity and aggregate mean-weight diameter were higher after the wheat harvest than after the rice harvest. Amorphous Fe oxide content was positively correlated with Fe-bound organic carbon content (P < 0.001) but negatively correlated with phenol oxidase activity (P < 0.001). Therefore, seasonal alternation of wetting and drying can progressively drive the rejuvenation of Fe oxides and simultaneously affect the activity of phenol oxidase. Oxidative precipitation of amorphous Fe oxides promoted the formation of organo-Fe complexes and macroaggregates, while flooding of the paddies decreased the activity of phenol oxidase, thereby resulting in year-round hindered decomposition. Organic fertilization strengthened the roles of the 'Fe gate' and 'enzyme latch' mechanisms, and thus accelerated SOC sequestration in the rice-wheat cropping system.

Riparian Vegetation and Sediment Supply Regulate the Morphodynamic Response of an Experimental Stream to Floods	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Feedbacks between woody plants and fluvial morphodynamics result in co-development of riparian vegetation communities and channel form. To advance mechanistic knowledge regarding these interactions, we measured the response of topography and flow to the presence of riparian tree seedlings with contrasting morphologies in an experimental, field-scale, meandering stream channel with a mobile sand bed. On a convex point bar, we installed seedlings of Tamarix spp. (tamarisk) and Populus fremontii (cottonwood) with intact roots and simulated a bankfull flood, with each of eight runs varying sediment supply, plant density, and plant species. Vegetation reduced turbulence and velocities on the bar relative to bare-bed conditions, inducing sediment deposition when vegetation was present, regardless of vegetation density or species. Sediment supply also played a dominant role, and eliminating sediment supply reduced deposition regardless of the presence of vegetation. Unexpectedly, plant density and species architecture (shrubby tamarisk vs. single-stemmed cottonwood) had only a secondary influence on hydraulics and sediment transport. In the absence of plants, mobile bedforms were prominent across the bar, but vegetation of all types decreased the height and lateral extent of bedforms migrating across the bar, suggesting a mechanism by which vegetation modulates feedbacks among sediment transport, topography, and hydraulics. Our measurements and resulting insights bridge the gap between laboratory conditions and real dryland sand-bed rivers and motivate further morphodynamic modeling.																				2296-665X				APR 5	2019	7								40	10.3389/fenvs.2019.00040	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2019.00040													WOS:000463684900001

Due to long-term misuse, the Israeli Sde Zin dryland site has faced severe degradation. The study objective was to assess the feasibility of passive restoration in recovering the site. The study was conducted in four land-units along a preservation-degradation continuum: (1) an area that has not faced anthropogenic disturbances (Ecological land); (2) an area that was proclaimed as a national park in the 1970s (Rehabilitation); (3) an area that was prone, until recently, to moderate anthropogenic pressures (Triangle); and (4) a dirt road that was subjected to long-term off-road traffic (Dirtroad). Soil was sampled and analyzed for its properties. The soil physical quality followed the trend of Ecological land > Rehabilitation > Triangle > Dirtroad. Specifically, high soil salinity in the latter three land-units is attributed to long-term erosional processes that exposed the underlying salic horizons. Herbaceous and shrubby vegetation cover was also monitored. The herbaceous vegetation cover followed the trend of Ecological land (86.4%) > Rehabilitation (40.3%) > Triangle (26.2%) > Dirtroad (2.1%), while the shrubby cover was 2.8% in the Ecological land-unit, and practically zero in the other land-units. It seems that despite the effectiveness of passive restoration in recovering the soil's physical properties, the recovery of vegetation is limited by the severe soil salinity.

Cumulative temporal vegetation indices from unoccupied aerial systems allow maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.) hybrid yield to be estimated across environments with fewer flights	PLOS ONE												Unoccupied aerial systems (UAS) based high throughput phenotyping studies require further investigation to combine different environments and planting times into one model. Here 100 elite breeding hybrids of maize (Zea mays L.) were evaluated in two environment trials-one with optimal planting and irrigation (IHOT), and one dryland with delayed planting (DHOT). RGB (Red-Green-Blue) based canopy height measurement (CHM) and vegetation indices (VIs) were estimated from a UAS platform. Time series and cumulative VIs, by both summation (Sigma VI-SUMs) and area under the curve (Sigma VI-AUCs), were fit via machine learning regression modeling (random forest, linear, ridge, lasso, elastic net regressions) to estimate grain yield. VIs were more valuable predictors of yield to combine different environments than CHM. Time series VIs and CHM produced high accuracies (similar to 68-72%), but inconsistent models. A little sacrifice in accuracy (similar to 60-65%) produced consistent models using Sigma VI-SUMs and CHM during pre-reproductive vegetative growth. Absence of VIs produced poorer accuracies (by about similar to 5-10%). Normalized difference type VIs produced maximum accuracies, and flowering times were the best times for UAS data acquisition. This study suggests that the best yielding varieties can be accurately predicted in new environments at or before flowering when combining multiple temporal flights and predictors.

The Brazilian Amazonian rainforest harbors a high diversity of yeasts associated with rotting wood, including many candidates for new yeast species	YEAST												This study investigated the diversity of yeast species associated with rotting wood in Brazilian Amazonian rainforests. A total of 569 yeast strains were isolated from rotting wood samples collected in three Amazonian areas (Universidade Federal do Amazonas-Universidade Federal do Amazonas [UFAM], Piquia, and Caru) in the municipality of Itacoatiara, Amazon state. The samples were cultured in yeast nitrogen base (YNB)-d-xylose, YNB-xylan, and sugarcane bagasse and corncob hemicellulosic hydrolysates (undiluted and diluted 1:2 and 1:5). Sugiyamaella was the most prevalent genus identified in this work, followed by Kazachstania. The most frequently isolated yeast species were Schwanniomyces polymorphus, Scheffersomyces amazonensis, and Wickerhamomyces sp., respectively. The alpha diversity analyses showed that the dryland forest of UFAM was the most diverse area, while the floodplain forest of Caru was the least. Additionally, the difference in diversity between UFAM and Caru was the highest among the comparisons. Thirty candidates for new yeast species were obtained, representing 36% of the species identified and totaling 101 isolates. Among them were species belonging to the clades Spathaspora, Scheffersomyces, and Sugiyamaella, which are recognized as genera with natural xylose-fermenting yeasts that are often studied for biotechnological and ecological purposes. The results of this work showed that rotting wood collected from the Amazonian rainforest is a tremendous source of diverse yeasts, including candidates for new species.

Ecological clusters of soil taxa within bipartite networks are highly sensitive to climatic conditions in global drylands	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Determining the influence of climate in driving the global distribution of soil microbial communities is fundamental to help predict potential shifts in soil food webs and ecosystem functioning under global change scenarios. Herein, we used a global survey including 80 dryland ecosystems from six continents, and found that the relative abundance of ecological clusters formed by taxa involved in bacteria-fungi and bacteria-cercozoa bipartite networks was highly sensitive to changes in temperature and aridity. Importantly, such a result was maintained when controlling for soil, geographical location and vegetation attributes, being pH and soil organic carbon important determinants of the relative abundance of the ecological clusters. We also identified potential global associations between important soil microbial taxa, which can be useful to support the conservation of terrestrial ecosystems under global change scenarios. Our results suggest that increases in temperature and aridity such as those forecasted for the next decades in drylands could potentially lead to drastic changes in the community composition of functionally important bipartite networks within soil food webs. This could have important but unknown implications for the provision of key ecosystem functions and associated services driven by the organisms forming these networks if other taxa cannot cope with them.This article is part of the theme issue 'Ecological complexity and the biosphere: the next 30 years'.

Aims and methods In this study, we integrated Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) with Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 and 20 Global Climate Models to systematically: (1) calibrate and validate APSIM using large-field study conducted in East-Central Texas; (2) evaluate the impacts of climate change on maize productivity and risks; and (3) investigate the variations in growth stage lengths. Key results Results indicated that APSIM simulated grain yield, biomass production, precipitation productivity (PP; kg ha(-1) mm(-1)) and developmental stage transition agreed well with observation (NRMSE < 14.9%). Changes in temperature and precipitation shortened growing seasons and affected available water, resulting in widely varied yield and PP. Mean grain yield changed from -34.8 to +19.7%, mean PP were improved 9.2-36.5%. The grain production could be maintained at least the standard of 75% of historical in most cases, but with greater risks for achieving higher threshold (50% of baseline). Finally, simulations indicated shortened days (4-13 days) for reaching key developmental stages for maize. Conclusions and implications The results advocate adoptions of management practice that incorporating early sowing, irrigations at sowing/VT stages, and selections of late-maturing cultivars for better sustainability and higher productivity.

This paper assesses the duration, frequency, and intensity of drought events in the Asian drylands based on nine climate models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). The results show that a high percentage of land area is experiencing significant drought intensification of 65.1%, 89.9%, and 99.8% under Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP)126, SSP245, and SSP585 scenarios, respectively. Furthermore, the data indicate that future droughts will become less frequent but longer in duration and more intense, with even more severe future droughts predicted for northwest China and western parts of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Drought durations of 10.8 months and 13.4 months are anticipated for the future periods of 2021-2060 and 2061-2100, respectively, compared to the duration of 6.6 months for the historical period (1960-2000). Meanwhile, drought intensity is expected to reach 0.97 and 1.37, respectively, for future events compared to 1.66 for the historical period. However, drought severity under SSP245 will be weaker than that under SSP126 due to the mitigating effect of precipitation. The results of this study can provide a basis for the development of adaptation measures in Asian dryland nations.

Effect of climate change on rainfed herbaceous crops	ITEA-INFORMACION TECNICA ECONOMICA AGRARIA												Herbaceous crops in Mediterranean dryland environments face a great challenge for survival in the scene of climate change. The intensification of water deficits and the most frequent high temperature events during the late spring (April-June), coinciding with the grain filling stage of many species, leads to continuous yield losses. In the Experimental Farm La Higueruela (Toledo, Spain), located in a typical Mediterranean agricultural environment of the Spanish dry land, it is analyzed how different meteorological variables are affecting cereal, chickpea, sunflower and vetch crops under conventional and ecological management. For this purpose, two long-term experiments (27 years) have been carried out, conventional end ecological managements, in which four crop rotations have been tested: Barley-Barley (CC), Barley-Chickpea (C-GAR), Barley -Sunflower (C-GIR), Barley-Vetch forage (C-VF). The results indicated that the meteorological variables that have registered a greater increase over time during the trial period are the average annual temperature of the agricultural year and those corresponding to the summer months, with the precipitation recorded during the month of May, as well as the frost period, the variables that have suffered the highest decrease. The most negatively affected crops were chickpea and sunflower in both agricultural managements and barley in organic farming, while the forage vetch would be favored in these conditions, especially in ecological management, due to its cultivation period.

High resolution spatiotemporal patterns of flow at the landscape scale in montane non-perennial streams	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Intermittent and ephemeral streams in dryland environments support diverse assemblages of aquatic and terrestrial life. Understanding when and where water flows provide insights into the availability of water, its response to external controlling factors, and potential sensitivity to climate change and a host of human activities. Knowledge regarding the timing of drying/wetting cycles can also be useful to map critical habitats for species and ecosystems that rely on these temporary water sources. However, identifying the locations and monitoring the timing of streamflow and channel sediment moisture remains a challenging endeavor. In this paper, we analyzed daily conductivity from 37 sensors distributed along 10 streams across an arid mountain front in Arizona (United States) to assess spatiotemporal patterns in flow permanence, defined as the timing and extent of water in streams. Conductivity sensors provide information on surface flow and sediment moisture, supporting a stream classification based on seasonal flow dynamics. Our results provide insight into flow responses to seasonal rainfall, highlighting stream reaches very reactive to rainfall versus those demonstrating more stable streamflow. The strength of stream responses to precipitation are explored in the context of surficial geology. In summary, conductivity data can be used to map potential stream habitat for water-dependent species in both space and time, while also providing the basis upon which sensitivity to ongoing climate change can be evaluated.

Root/Shoot Growth to Different Mulching Materials in Semi-Arid Areas of Northwest China	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Adaptive highly efficient mulching technologies for use on dryland agricultural ecosystems are crucial to improving crop productivity and water-use efficiency (WUE) under climate change. Little information is available on the effect of using different types of mulch on soil water thermal conditions, or on root/shoot trait, leaf area index (LAI), leaf area duration (LAD), yield, and WUE of spring maize. Hence, in this study, white transparent plastic film (WF), black plastic film (BF), and maize straw (MS) was used, and the results were compared with a non-mulched control (CK). The results showed that the mean soil temperature throughout the whole growth period of maize at the 5-15 cm depth under WF and BF was higher than under MS and CK, but under BF, it was 0.6 degrees C lower than WF. Compared with CK, the average soil water storage (0-200 cm) over the whole growth period of maize was significantly increased under WF, BF, and MS. WF and BF increased the soil water and temperature during the early growth stages of maize and significantly increased root/shoot biomass, root volume, LAI, LAD, and yield compared with MS. Higher soil temperatures under WF obviously reduced the duration of maize reproductive growth and accelerated root and leaf senescence, leading to small root/shoot biomass accumulation post-tasseling and to losses in yield compared with BF.																				2073-4395				APR	2020	10	4							453	10.3390/agronomy10040453	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10040453													WOS:000534620300002

Dust provenance and its role as a potential fertilizing agent for the Okavango Delta, Botswana	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Dust plays a globally important role in supplying biologically essential elements to landscapes underlain by nutrient-poor substrates. Here we show that dust may play a significant role in sustaining productivity in the vast wetlands of the Okavango Delta in southern Africa, one of the world's richest biodiversity hotspots. Dust accumulates preferentially on tree-covered islands in the seasonal swamps of the Delta, creating pockets of fine-grained, nutrient-rich material within the semi-arid landscape of the Kalahari Desert. Strontium and neodymium isotopes reveal that this dust likely originates predominantly from the Makgadikgadi salt pans, located 300 km away, and contributes 10-80% of the fine-grained material present in Okavango island soils. Surface material sourced from the Makgadikgadi Pans contains relatively high amounts of bioavailable phosphorus and iron, potentially influencing Okavango Delta biological productivity. We propose that long-term ecosystem productivity and nutrient availability in the Okavango may be strongly mediated by regional dust inputs. Understanding the influence of dust deposition on nutrient loads and biogeochemical cycling is thus critical for predicting the response of the Okavango Delta to future changes in climate. We suggest that dust inputs may play a significant role in the supply of nutrients to other large, global wetland systems located in dryland environments.

Potential for Beneficial Reuse of Oil and Gas-Derived Produced Water in Agriculture: Physiological and Morphological Responses in Spring Wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>)	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Produced water (PW) from oil and gas operations is considered a potential resource for food crop irrigation because of increasing water scarcity in dryland agriculture. However, efforts to employ PW for agriculture have been met with limited success. A greenhouse study was performed to evaluate the effects of PW on physiological and morphological traits of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum). Plants were irrigated with water treatments containing 10 and 50% PW (PW10 and PW50, respectively) and compared to a matching 50% salinity (NaCl50) and 100% tap water controls. Compared to controls, plants watered with PW10 and PW50 exhibited developmental arrest and reductions in aboveground and belowground biomass, photosynthetic efficiency, and reproductive growth. Decreases in grain yield ranged from 70 to 100% in plants irrigated with PW compared to the tap water control. Importantly, the PW10 and NaCl50 treatments were comparable for morphophysiological effects, even though NaCl50 contained 5 times the total dissolved solids, suggesting that constituents other than NaCl in PW contributed to plant stress. These findings indicate that despite discharge and reuse requirements focused on total dissolved solids, salinity stress may not be the primary factor affecting crop health. The results of the present study are informative for developing guidelines for the use of PW in agriculture to ensure minimal effects on crop morphology and physiology.

Soil detachment capacity by rill flow (D-c) is a key parameter for quantifying intensity of rill erosion in many process-based erosion models. However, only a limited number of studies have been devoted to soil detachment capacity for the various types of loess soil such as is found on the Loess Plateau, where there is variation from south to north and in terms of soil particle size composition. The objectives of this study were (1) to discriminate differences in soil detachment capacity by rill flow (D-c) among five loess soils, (2) to investigate the relationship between D-c and hydrodynamic parameters, and the relationship between D-c and soil properties, and (3) to establish an equation to model soil detachment capacity by rill flow for the loess region. Soil detachment capacity by rill flow for five typical loess soils found on the Loess Plateau of China was investigated through a flume experiment by varying five flow discharges and five slope gradients. The results show that D-c of SM sandy loess is the largest with a mean of 2.2145 kg m(-2) s(-1), followed by YL clay loess, DB sandy loess, AS loess, and CW loess. Stream power is the best hydrodynamic parameter to describe the dynamic process of soil detachment capacity by rill flow for these five loess soils. Soil detachment capacity by rill flow was negatively correlated with soil cohesion and effective silt content (P < 0.05), while it was positively correlated with effective median soil particle size (P < 0.01) and effective sand content (P < 0.05). Soil detachment capacity by rill flow for various hydraulic and soil conditions in the loess region could be modeled using a quaternary power function of slope gradient, flow discharge, soil cohesion and effective median particle size (NSE = 0.96), or it could be modeled by a ternary power function which calculates the variation of soil detachment capacity with stream power, soil cohesion and effective median size (NSE = 0.96). The results of this study reveal the mechanism of soil detachment by rill flow and advance development of a physically-based rill erosion model. Future research should focus on the impact of effective particle size on D-c to ensure a full understanding of soil erosion processes.					Guo, QI/HQY-9560-2023; Delang, Claudio O.

P. Beauv.) is an important traditional cereal crop in dryland ecological agriculture in China and is widely grown in India, the United States, and Nigeria. It is of significance to understand the variety-location-fertilizer (V-L-F) interaction for highly efficient production. Therefore, a two-year field experiment was conducted with six varieties in five locations, and data were analyzed by combined ANOVA analysis, redundancy analysis (RDA), and additive main multiplicative interaction (AMMI). The results showed that the mean sum of squares was significantly different among years, locations, varieties, fertilizations, and their interactions, except for Y-V and V-F interactions. The contributions of various factors to yield variation varied, location was the largest contributor (38.7%), followed by year (33.6%), and variety and fertilizer contributed 7.1% and 3.2%, respectively. JI25 was widely adapted, and its yield was stable and higher than that of others over diverse environments in two years. The RDA results showed that two principal components explained more than 66.1% of the yield variance, while more than 63.0% of the variances were clustered in the first factor. Excessive single rainfall or total rainfall and air temperature (especially minimum temperature) were significantly associated with the millet yield. The results offered an important reference for variety layout, natural resource potential mining, and formulation of efficient green cultural practices.																				2073-4395				SEP	2022	12	9							2216	10.3390/agronomy12092216	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12092216													WOS:000857417900001

Genetic parameters and potential gains from breeding for biomass and cineole production in three-year-old <i>Eucalyptus polybractea</i> progeny trials	AUSTRALIAN FORESTRY												Eucalyptus polybractea is a mallee eucalypt with potential use as a perennial biomass crop for dryland agriculture in southern Australia, in addition to its established success as a source of eucalyptus oil. Sixty-six indigenous, open-pollinated families from West Wyalong and surrounds in New South Wales were tested in trials at Newdegate, Western Australia; Drummartin, Victoria; and Condobolin, New South Wales. Growth was fastest at Condobolin, followed by Drummartin then Newdegate. The estimated cross-site genetic correlation was r(g) = 0.85 +/- 0.16 between Newdegate and Condobolin, r(g) = 1.08 +/- 0.35 between Newdegate and Drummartin, and r(g) = 1.03 +/- 0.32 between Condobolin and Drummartin. Estimated gains suggest that genotype x environment interaction was not practically significant. Narrow-sense heritability for biomass production was (2) = 0.18 +/- 0.07 at Newdegate, (2) = 0.05 +/- 0.04 at Drummartin and (2) = 0.32 +/- 0.08 at Condobolin. Heritability of leaf cineole concentration at Newdegate was (2) = 0.38 +/- 0.09. The genetic correlation between leaf cineole concentration and biomass production was r(g) = 0.07 +/- 0.19 and the phenotypic correlation was r(p) = -0.12 +/- 0.03. Compared to selection on either tree biomass or leaf cineole concentration, index selection incorporating both whole tree biomass and leaf cineole concentration is most effective when looking to maximise both cineole yield and biomass production.																			0004-9158	2325-6087				JAN 2	2021	84	1					13	24		10.1080/00049158.2021.1892999	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00049158.2021.1892999		MAR 2021											WOS:000625744700001

Natural ultraviolet radiation exposure alters photosynthetic biology and improves recovery from desiccation in a desert moss	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												Plants in dryland ecosystems experience extreme daily and seasonal fluctuations in light, temperature, and water availability. We used an in situ field experiment to uncover the effects of natural and reduced levels of ultraviolet radiation (UV) on maximum PSII quantum efficiency (F-v/F-m), relative abundance of photosynthetic pigments and antioxidants, and the transcriptome in the desiccation-tolerant desert moss Syntrichia caninervis. We tested the hypotheses that: (i) S. caninervis plants undergo sustained thermal quenching of light [non-photochemical quenching (NPQ)] while desiccated and after rehydration; (ii) a reduction of UV will result in improved recovery of F-v/F-m; but (iii) 1 year of UV removal will de-harden plants and increase vulnerability to UV damage, indicated by a reduction in F-v/F-m. All field-collected plants had extremely low F-v/F-m after initial rehydration but recovered over 8 d in lab-simulated winter conditions. UV-filtered plants had lower F-v/F-m during recovery, higher concentrations of photoprotective pigments and antioxidants such as zeaxanthin and tocopherols, and lower concentrations of neoxanthin and ChI b than plants exposed to near natural UV levels. Field-grown S. caninervis underwent sustained NPQ that took days to relax and for efficient photosynthesis to resume. Reduction of solar UV radiation adversely affected recovery of F-v/F-m following rehydration.

Simulated impact of paleoclimate change on Fremont Native American maize farming in Utah, 850-1449 CE, using crop and climate models	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The Fremont were members of an expansive maize-based Ancestral Puebloan (AP) cultural complex who disappeared from Utah between the 12th and 13th centuries CE. This period brackets that of a climatic transition in the Southwest from the warm, dry Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA, ca. 850-1350 CE) to the cool, hydroclimatically variable Little Ice Age (LIA, ca. 1350-1850 CE). We simulated maize (Zea mays) crop productivity for Fremont AP archaeological sites in Utah between 850 and 1449 CE using a process-based crop model driven by climatologies from a statistically downscaled a climate model. We compared the model-simulated crop yields to time-series of archaeological site occupations given by spatially discrete, chronologically summed probability distributions (SPDs) of radiocarbon-dated Fremont artifacts. We found that the anomalous abandonment of different sites throughout Utah may be explained by site-specific combinations of reduced mean yield due to volatile year-to-year yields caused by increasing temperature variability, increasing hydro-climatic variability, and loss of soil quality, which depended on crop management strategy. In other words, we model the elimination of the Fremont AP ecological niche by exogenous influences of temperature and precipitation variability at the MCA-LIA transition and endogenous degradation of soil from organic carbon and nitrogen loss. Our method has broad applicability to contexts of low-technology, dryland farming human-environmental interactions.

This article calibrated and analyzed the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series of Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data from 1982 to 2015 in the Loess Plateau, China. The spatial and temporal distributions of vegetation phenology and NPP in the Loess Plateau under semihumid and semiarid conditions were investigated. The seasonal variation in the NPP response to vegetation phenology under the climate change was also analyzed. The results showed that, different from the northern forest, there was distinct spatial heterogeneity in the effect of climate change on the dynamic change in vegetation growth in the Loess Plateau: 1) an advance of the start of the growing season (SOS) and a delay of the end of the growing season (EOS) significantly increased the NPP in spring and autumn, respectively, in the humid southeast; 2) in the arid northwest, the NPP did not significantly increase in spring and autumn but significantly decreased in summer.					wang, pengtao/D-8289-2016	wang, pengtao/0000-0001-8371-5850													1002-0063	1993-064X				APR	2022	32	2					340	357		10.1007/s11769-022-1270-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-022-1270-8													WOS:000771673000011

To plug the productivity gap, further improvement in grain yield must be attained by enhancing the genetic potential of new cultivars that depends on the genetic diversity of the parents. Hence, our aim was to assess genetic diversity and population structure of elite soybean genotypes, mainly released cultivars and advanced selections in SSA. In this study, a set of 165 lines was genotyped with high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers covering the complete genome of soybean. The genetic diversity (0.414) was high considering the bi-allelic nature of SNP markers. The polymorphic information content (PIC) varied from 0.079 to 0.375, with an average of 0.324 and about 49% of the markers had a PIC value above 0.350. Cluster analysis grouped all the genotypes into three major clusters. The model-based STRUCTURE and discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) exhibited high consistency in the allocation of lines in subpopulations or groups. Nonetheless, they presented some discrepancy and identified the presence of six and five subpopulations or groups, respectively. Principal coordinate analysis revealed more consistency with subgroups suggested by DAPC analysis. Our results clearly revealed the broad genetic base of TGx (Tropical Glycine max) lines that soybean breeders may select parents for crossing, testing and selection of future cultivars with desirable traits for SSA.

J	Wei, HQ; Zhou, GY; Fu, SH				Wei, Hongqiang; Zhou, Guiyun; Fu, Suhua			Efficient Priority-Flood depression filling in raster digital elevation models	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH												Depressions in raster digital elevation models (DEM) present a challenge for extracting hydrological networks. They are commonly filled before subsequent algorithms are further applied. Among existing algorithms for filling depressions, the Priority-Flood algorithm runs the fastest. In this study, we propose an improved variant over the fastest existing sequential variant of the Priority-Flood algorithm for filling depressions in floating-point DEMs. The proposed variant introduces a series of improvements and greatly reduces the number of cells that need to be processed by the priority queue (PQ), the key data structure used in the algorithm. The proposed variant is evaluated based on statistics from 30 experiments. On average, our proposed variant reduces the number of cells processed by the PQ by around 70%. The speed-up ratios of our proposed variant over the existing fastest variant of the Priority-Flood algorithm range from 31% to 52%, with an average of 45%. The proposed variant can be used to fill depressions in large DEMs in much less time and in the parallel implementation of the Priority-Flood algorithm to further reduce the running time for processing huge DEMs that cannot be dealt with easily on single computers.																			1753-8947	1753-8955				APR 3	2019	12	4					415	427		10.1080/17538947.2018.1429503	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2018.1429503													WOS:000461865100003

This study investigated the spatiotemporal variation of land use/cover changes (LUCC) and quantifies the change in four essential ecosystem services with an emphasis on soil (nutrient delivery ratio, carbon storage, crop production, and water yield) and their relationships in the Jiroft plain, Iran, during 1996-2016 through analytical tools including Land Change Modeler, and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoff. During the 20-year concentrate period, there was a considerable overall gain in cropland (5396 km(2)) and urban (1787 km(2)), loss of unused land (5692 km(2)), water (2088 km(2)), and forest (1083 km(2)). As a result of LUCC, while crop production and nutrient delivery ratio showed a rising trend, overall carbon storage and water yield decreased. The spatiotemporal trade-off between carbon storage and crop production, the temporal trade-off between crop production and water yield, and synergy between water yield and crop production were widespread in Jiroft plain. These results showed that the interaction among ESs mutates over time and can be changed under planning and policies. This study will enrich the research of the geographical distribution of ESs interaction in dryland ecosystems to provide practical ecosystem management under local conditions.

Although increasing evidence underlines the collective contribution of different biodiversity components on the simultaneous performance of multiple functions (multifunctionality), we know little about the trade-offs between individual diversity effects and the extent to which they determine multifunctionality differentially. Here, at a subcontinental scale of 62 dryland sites, we show in phototrophic microbiota of biological soil crusts (biocrusts) that, whereas richness alone is unable to guarantee the maxima of multifunctional performance, interspecies facilitation and compositional identity are particularly stronger but often neglected predictors. The inconsistent effects of different biodiversity components imply that soil multifunctionality can be lost despite certain species remaining present. Moreover, we reveal a significant empirical association between species functional importance and its topological feature in co-occurrence networks, indicating a functional signal of species interaction. Nevertheless, abundant species tend to isolate and merely interact within small topological structures, but rare species were tightly connected in complicated network modules. Our findings suggest that abundant and rare species of soil phototrophs exhibit distinct functional relevance. These results give a comprehensive view of how soil constructive species drive multifunctionality in biocrusts and ultimately promote a deeper understanding of the consequences of biodiversity loss in real-world ecosystems.

However, the response of soil inorganic carbon (SIC), which is a major component of dryland carbon pools, to this vegetation shift remains unknown. We conducted a systematic field survey in 75 pairs of shrub-encroached grassland (SEG) and control plots at 25 sites in the grasslands of the Inner Mongolia Plateau to evaluate how shrub encroachment affects SIC density (SICD) in these ecosystems. We found that shrub encroachment significantly reduced SICD in the upper 100 cm (3.85 vs. 4.74 kg C m(-2), p < .05), especially in the subsurface soil (20-50 cm layer). The magnitude of SICD changes was related to the change in soil pH, shrub patch size and initial SICD, reflecting that the reduction in SICD might be attributed to the shrub encroachment-related soil acidification. Our results also revealed that the lost SIC was mainly released into the atmosphere rather than redistributed into deeper soil layers. Synthesis. We provide the first evidence for the soil acidification-induced SIC loss caused by shrub encroachment. Our findings highlight the non-negligible role of SIC dynamics in the C budget of SEG ecosystems and the need to consider these dynamics in terrestrial C cycle research.

The production and nutrients in the fine roots of fertilized <i>Pinus tabulaeformis</i> plantation forests in the Loess Plateau in China	JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												Fine roots (FRs; <2 mm in diameter) might act as substantial pools of underground carbon and nutrients in the forest ecosystem. Since nutrient availability directly impacts plant growth, any changes in soil fertilization and subsequent changes in nutrients would alter the production of FRs. Here, we investigated the impact of fertilization with nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) [control, N (200 kg/ha/y), P (100 kg/ha/y), and N + P (200 kg N/ha/y + 100 kg P/ha/y)] on the FR production, biomass, turnover rate, N:P ratio in young (10-year) and nearly mature (40-year) Pinus tabulaeformis forest stands in the Loess Plateau in China. The production and biomass of FRs were evaluated using the ingrowth core and the soil core methods, respectively. The results showed that during the first growing season after N or P fertilization, neither the production, biomass nor the turnover rate of FRs responded significantly to the treatments. A substantial increase in the TN content was observed after fertilization with N, P, and N + P in the FR of the young forest stand, but not in the mature forest stand. The ratio of N:P in FRs increased after N addition but did not respond to P addition significantly in either the young or mature forest stands, indicating that FR N:P ratio was affected more by N availability than by P availability in P. tabulaeformis forests on the Loess Plateau.

However, a changing climate and anthropogenic impacts are resulting in the degradation of dryland ecosystems to varying degrees. While there has been the global implementation of Ecological Restoration Programs (ERPs) to restore degraded ecosystems, there remains limited comprehensive assessment of their impacts on ESs of drylands. In this study, the sandy areas of northern China were used as the study area. The RUSLE, RWEQ, CASA, and InVEST models were used to simulate four major ESs: soil conservation (SC), sand fixation (SF), carbon sequestration (CS), and water yield (WY). The study aimed to evaluate the influences of various ERPs on major ESs. The dominant factors affecting the overall benefits provided by ESs were also identified. Since ERPs were implemented, forest areas have increased by 2.8 x 10(4) km(2), whereas the areas of cropland, shrubland, and grassland have decreased. There were generally increasing trends in SF, SC, and CS, whereas there was a decreasing trend in WY. We then used a scenario-based simulation approach to eliminate the influence of climate variability on ESs. The results showed increasing trends in SF, SC, and CS, whereas there were minimal changes in WY. The results suggested that although ERPs can significantly increase regional ESs, unregulated expansion in vegetation can result in a water crisis and affect regional water security.

Agro-advisories boost informed decision-making as well as planning of farm activities. The purpose of this study was to characterize the pathways through which farmers receive usable location-specific agro-advisories as well as to evaluate the effect of the socio-economic environment in the access to such information. Data was collected from 400 randomly selected households in lower eastern Kenya in a cross-sectional survey. Multivariate probit regression was used to determine the factors influencing the choice of pathways used in accessing climate change adaptation information. Household socio-economic characteristics that were found to be significant in explaining access to disseminated agro-advisories include phone and radio ownership, level of education, marital status, and farm size among others. Based on these findings a conclusion is made that the socio-economic environment within which information is disseminated is vital in determining those who access information and probably act on it. Additionally, pathways found to be complementary or substitutable give information providers new insights on the channels to use in information dissemination. The study recommends that these factors be considered in efforts geared towards promoting agro-advisory preparation and dissemination to improve adaptation to climate variability and change in dryland areas.																			0266-6669	1741-6469				JAN	2023	39	1					60	71	02666669211026005	10.1177/02666669211026005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/02666669211026005		JUL 2021											WOS:000671416300001

The growth period, biomass, and yield of two wheat cultivars (early- vs. late-maturing) were simulated by the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) validated with pot experiments under the scenarios of elevated [CO2] and 2 degrees C warming based on the baseline climate for 1961-2016 at Taigu in North China. We also investigated the effects of extreme high temperature on the yield and yield components of these wheat cultivars. We found that APSIM well simulated the changes in the growth period, leaf area index (LAI), biomass, and yield induced by 2 degrees C warming and elevated [CO2]. Long-term simulations showed that 2 degrees C warming decreased the growing period between sowing and jointing for both cultivars. 2 degrees C warming and elevated [CO2] affected the wheat yield mainly by altering the grain numbers. Extreme high temperature decreased the grain numbers and yield of the late-maturing cultivar but not the early-maturing one. The findings suggest that early-maturing cultivar would be better adapted to elevated [CO2] and rising temperature than the late-maturing one in the eastern Loess Plateau.

This region is prone to drought problems, especially the widespread creation of dried soil layer (DSL), which is intensified by the revegetation from GFGP initiatives. A DSL is the result of soil desiccation in deep soil profiles. The occurrence and expansion of DSLs are strengthened by the high risk of the Loess Plateau to climate change. On the basis of the 14-year data of soil water content (SWC) of four revegetation types on a loessial slope, we investigated the evolution processes and recovery possibility of DSL. Results showed that both variation trends and abrupt changes in the SWC time series were distinctly affected by revegetation. The 40 cm thickness of the DSL was triggered when Medicago sativa and Caragana korshinskii grew for 2 and 4 years, respectively. The downward extension depth of DSL reached 580 cm under the two plants above within 7 and 8 years of planting. However, the results suggested the possibility of DSL disappearance as shown by the formation depth dynamics of DSL, the fluctuation of DSL-SWC, and the phenomenon of sandwiched DSL. During deep moisture recharge and DSL recovery, although the SWC sensitivity to textural variation was present in the vertical profile, the effects of soil texture on SWC were decreased. Wet climate was linked to both DSL thinning and thickening. Thus, the effect of wet climate is bidirectional for DSL development, thereby highlighting the important role of revegetation. The results of this work enhance our understanding of DSL and may help alleviate the risk of drought in the Loess Plateau.

The importance of open data describing prey item species lists for endangered species	ECOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS AND EVIDENCE												1. Open data and code can be transformative tools in supporting evidence-informed solutions for stakeholders. Data can take many forms of evidence in the discipline of applied ecology including tables, lists, maps and visualizations to name a few. 2. Endangered and listed species are often a catalyst for research, conservation and planning. Here, a novel, open data set summarizing all the reported diet and prey items for all endangered, terrestrial dryland species listed in central California is provided as a case study. These data highlight the critical need for sharing data rapidly and transparently to support ecological solution science. 3. Systematic review practices were used, data were compiled and the resulting data set was published in an open access, federated data repository using ecological metadata language and FAIR principles. The goal is to show that these data can now be used and analysed by applied ecologists and stakeholders to identify not only the habitat and spatial needs for the endangered species but to widen the conservation protection net to include prey species. 4. Conserving viable habitat with higher likelihoods of prey presence will better support conservation of endangered species, and data describing reported species are a crucial first step. Interactive tables, local species lists and maps are simple tools that can now be developed regionally with open data such as these.																				2688-8319				APR	2023	4	2							e12251	10.1002/2688-8319.12251	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2688-8319.12251													WOS:001019820500001

This species is widely cultivated in dryland areas in the Amazon, presenting high genetic diversity. Therefore, it presents a high potential for use in breeding. The objective of this study was to select pepper genotypes with potential resistance to anthracnose (Colletotrichum brevisporum). For this purpose, ripe fruits of pepper were acquired from the producing farms in the municipalities of Iranduba, Manacapuru, Rio Preto da Eva and Presidente Figueiredo. The experiments were conducted in seedlings (Phase I) and in mature and immature fruits (Phase II). The evaluation of the disease severity was performed using a scale of scores. The morphoagronomic characterization of the genotypes considered the fruits in the immature and mature stages and plant growth habit. The injured areas in the immature fruits ranged from 0.3 to 9.7 cm(2) and in the mature areas, it ranged from 0.2 to 9.9 cm(2). The genotypes RPE41 and MPU29 indicated resistance to anthracnose in both stages. The morphoagronomic characterization of the fruits revealed variability for mass (5.58 to 13.74 g), length ICI (4.08 to 8.16 cm), diameter (D) (1.74 to 2.54 cm), L/D ratio (1.88 to 4.70) and color of the fruit.

Weathered coal (WC), biochar (BC), and grass peat (GP) have been used widely and globally for a long time. However, the differences in soil physical properties following the application of these amendments have rarely been evaluated under the same field conditions. Methods In this study, the changes in the physical properties of loamy clay soil after applying WC, BC, and GP (3%, w:w) were investigated under field conditions after 375 days. Results Relative to unamended soil, the WC, BC, and GP applications increased the total porosity and decreased the bulk density of amended soils (P < 0.05). The soil water content increased by 23.8% following the BC application, whereas it was decreased by 10.5% following the GP application (P < 0.05). The application of all the amendments increased the soil average temperature by 0.71 degrees C (GP), 0.41 degrees C (WC), and 0.18 degrees C (BC) (P < 0.05). Additionally, the WC application increased the fraction of aggregates of 1-2 mm in size (by 47.6%) and of 2-5 mm in size (by 65.8%), and the stability of soil aggregates (P < 0.05). All the amendments increased the soil pores (> 300 and 30-300 mu m) of amended soils, but the saturated hydraulic conductivity of these soils was not significantly improved. Conclusion The application of WC can improve the formation and stability of soil aggregates to reduce the risk of soil erosion. BC is suitable for use in drought-prone areas with low rainfall and strong evaporation because it can increase the retention capacity of soil water. GP should be applied with caution, considering that its decomposition after extraction leads to the severe loss of organic carbon to the atmosphere. Overall, the selection of organic amendments in agricultural management practices should take into account the local environmental conditions.

Consortium of Management Practices in Long-Run Improves Soil Fertility and Carbon Sequestration in Drylands of Semi-Arid Tropics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION												A continuously declining carbon in soils of drylands has increasingly become a source of concern and needs integrated solutions to achieve global food security and sustainability goals. This study analysed the impact and sustainability of management practices for climate change mitigation and food security in dryland tropics using long-term field trials. We compared a consortium of interventions, comprised four treatments, viz. traditional farming, improved practice, and regenerative treatments. Additionally, we presented the results of regeneration practices aimed at maintaining the soil macro and micro-aggregates. Results showed significantly higher soil organic carbon (SOC) in the topsoil layer (0-15 cm) of regeneration areas compared to the precision farming area. Our long-term experiments with a consortium of interventions resulted in a promising increase in soil carbon and crop yields. We selected shared socioeconomic pathways for scenarios in future climates and simulated the effect of improved practices in the near and distant future. Our simulation results revealed that adopting improved practices enhanced soil carbon at the rate of 0.7% per year and provided additional income from the yield of pulses in the 2-year rotation. Similarly, we observed an increasing trend in SOC building for improved practices in all future climate scenarios. However, the traditional practice showed a clear decline (0.20-0.15%) in SOC stock for all shared-socio-economic pathways.

Many regions in the world have undergone rapid land use change and intensification of agricultural land, such as through irrigation expansion, upgrading irrigation systems, and changing grassland, stock, and nutrient management practices. With more intensive land use, changes to soil properties can occur, such as soil compaction and changes in soil water storage. The effects of modern sprinkler-irrigated pastoral farming on soil physical properties are not well quantified internationally, particularly for temperate climates. Aims. This regional study evaluates the effect of irrigation on soil physical properties in topsoil and subsoil, under modern pastoral grazing and sprinkler irrigation, across Canterbury, New Zealand. Methods. Paired sites were sampled, consisting of a spray-irrigated paddock (field) and an adjoined part of the same paddock that was dryland (unirrigated), with other management the same for each pair. Key results. Under irrigation there was a shift towards a greater abundance of smaller pores. This was reflected in macroporosity and readily available water capacity being significantly lower under irrigation, while semi-available water capacity and unavailable water held below permanent wilting point both increased. Conclusions. These differences reflect increased compaction under irrigated grazed pasture, particularly under dairy grazing, consistent with findings in similar studies. This study quantified changes in both the topsoil and subsoil but showed that most differences were confined to the topsoil (30 cm depth).

Aridity stimulates responses of root production and turnover to warming but suppresses the responses to nitrogen addition in temperate grasslands of northern China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Global warming and nitrogen (N) deposition are known to affect root dynamics in grasslands. However, previous studies were based only on a single ecosystem type, so it is unclear how warming and N addition affect root traits (root biomass, root-shoot ratio, root production and turnover) along the aridity gradient. In this study, we conducted an experiment to determine the effects of warming and N addition on root traits in desert, typical, and meadow grasslands in northern China, where the aridity gradually decreases from west to east across the region. Warming increased root-shoot ratio in dry year due to decline in soil water, but had a downward trend in root production and turnover in all three grasslands. N addition decreased root-shoot ratio in humid year due to increase in soil N, whereas did not significantly affect root production in any grasslands and increased root turnover in desert and meadow grasslands rather than typical grassland. Warming combined with N addition had negatively additive effects on root turnover in typical and meadow grasslands rather than desert grassland. N addition-induced changes in root biomass and root-shoot ratio were negatively affected by aridity in dry year. Aridity positively affected responses of root production and turnover to warming but negatively affected those responses to N addition. However, root-shoot ratio, root production and turnover under warming combined with N addition were not affected by aridity. Our results suggest that warming suppresses root carbon (C) input but N addition may exacerbate it in temperate grasslands, and warming combined with N addition suppresses it only in wet grasslands. Aridity promotes root C input under warming but suppresses it under N addition. However, aridity may little affect soil C and nutrient dynamics under global warming combined with N deposition in temperate grasslands in the future. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The integrated use of compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) and enantiomer-specific analysis is a promising technique for understanding the behavior and fate of organic pollutants in soils. In this study, soil samples were collected from paddy fields in three major rice cultivation regions of China, spanning a transect of 4000 km. The mean concentrations of ƩHCHs in paddy soils from the Taihu Plain were the highest (1.44 ng/g). The ratios of & alpha;-HCH/13-HCH (all below 11.8) and & alpha;-HCH/& gamma;-HCH (92% below 4.64), as well as the enantiomeric fractions (EFs) of chiral & alpha;-HCH (mean of 0.81), reflected that the distribution of HCHs was affected by the use of both technical HCHs and lindane. The preferential depletion of (-)-& alpha;-HCH and pronounced carbon isotope fractionation of & alpha;-HCH (813C of-28.22 & PLUSMN; 0.92%o --23.63 & PLUSMN; 1.89%o) demonstrated its effective transformation. Factors such as altitude, soil temperature, soil pH, soil conductivity and soil organic matter significantly influenced the fate and transformation of HCHs. The current study highlights the integrated application of CSIA and enantiomer-specific analysis to provide multiple lines of evidence for the transformation of HCHs in soils.																			0304-3894	1873-3336				OCT 5	2023	459								132196	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132196	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132196		AUG 2023						37536155					WOS:001051490000001

Focusing on two ecological restoration and rehabilitation practitioner organizations and their workers, this paper evaluates perceptions of the extent to which short-term knowledge exchange contributes to social goals in ecological restoration and rehabilitation in South Africa through (1) stakeholder engagement and awareness of community well-being, and (2) knowledge enrichment. Data collected through impact questionnaires, participatory site visits, practical work exchange, focus group discussions, and a workshop are analyzed using thematic analysis framed by the International Principles and Standards for the Practice of Ecological Restoration #1 and #2. We explore participants' perceptions of knowledge exchange benefits and discuss implications for future collaboration in establishing long-term knowledge exchange. Findings show that knowledge exchange is perceived to result in enhanced teamwork engagement, and strengthened knowledge on restoration techniques through mutual learning, inspiration, and a strengthened sense of community. Findings suggest that sustained knowledge exchange and engagement activities between different practitioner organizations is key to realize and transform short-term perceived benefits into long-term applied socioecological impacts across landscapes in dryland Africa. There is a need to progress from short-term, horizontal learning, to long-term (horizontal and vertical) knowledge exchange, to inform restoration project design and implementation.

Fusarium crown rot (FCR) is a chronic and severe disease in many dryland wheat-producing areas worldwide. In the last few years, the incidence and severity of FCR progressively increased in China, and the disease has currently become a new threat to local wheat crops. Here, we report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on a set of 358 Chinese germplasms with the wheat 55 K SNP array. A total of 104 SNPs on chromosomes 1BS, 1DS, 2AL, 5AL, 5DS, 5DL, 6BS and 7BL were significantly associated with seedling resistance to FCR in the association panel. Of these SNPs, a novel 13.78 Mb region targeted by five SNPs on chromosome arm 5DL was continually detected in all three trials. The effects of this region on FCR resistance was confirmed in biparental population. qRT-PCR showed that within this 5DL region, several genes encoding TIR-NBS-LRR proteins and proteins related to mycotoxins deoxynivalenol (DON) detoxification increased rapidly in the disease-resistant variety 04 Zhong 36 than the susceptible variety Xinmai 26 after inoculation. Our study provides new insights into gene discovery and creation of new cultivars with desirable alleles for improving FCR resistance in wheat.					cheng, cheng/JBR-8359-2023														0040-5752	1432-2242				JUL	2020	133	7					2063	2073		10.1007/s00122-020-03577-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-020-03577-1								32172298					WOS:000542361400003

In this study, metagenomic sequencing combined with metabolite determination was used to explore microorganisms and genes potentially involved in DEHP degradation in aerobic and anaerobic soils. The results showed that under both dryland aerobic and flooded anaerobic conditions, DEHP was initially hydrolyzed into mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate which was then hydrolyzed into phthalic acid; benzoic acid was the central intermediate during further metabolism steps. Bacteria were more responsive to DEHP presence than fungi/archaea, and potential degradative genes stimulated by DEHP were predominantly associated with bacteria, reflecting the dominant role of bacteria in DEHP degradation. Members of the Actinomycetales seemed to be the dominant degraders under aerobic conditions, while a number of phyla i.e. Gemmatimonadetes, Amteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Bacteroidetes appeared to be involved under anaerobic conditions. Interestingly, -50% of esterase/lipase/cytochrome P450 genes enriched by DEHP under aerobic conditions were from Nocardioide.s, a bacterial genus that has not been previously directly linked to phthalate ester degradation. The results indicate that novel degraders may play an important role in DEHP degradation in natural soil environments. This study provides a better understanding of the phthalate ester biodegradation processes occurring in soil. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In recent years, as a result of climate change, coupled with high livestock grazing, rangeland productivity has decreased. This study aimed to analyse the stability of forage dry matter (DM) production of 36 cocksfoot genotypes across four rain-fed environments (Ardebil, Zanjan, Hamadan, and Kermanshah) in Iran. At each location, an experiment was conducted using a randomised complete-block design (RCBD) with three replications over 2 years. The result of combined analysis of variance (ANOVA) across locations showed significant effects of environment (E), genotype (G), and GE interaction (P < 0.01) for DM yield. The E, G and GE interaction effects accounted for 33.19%, 17.98% and 40.52% of the total variance respectively. The GE interaction was subsequently investigated using regression stability, Additive Main effects and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI), and genotype main effect (G) plus genotype-environment (GE) interaction (GGE) biplot analysis. According to the regression method, genotypes G2, G3, G11 and G12 with a slope close to unity, coupled with high production, had good general stability in all locations. In addition, some genotypes were specifically identified for poor- and high-performing environments. According to the AMMI-2, IPC1 vs IPC2 biplot, genotypes G2, G10, G11, G14 and G15, placed close to the origin of the biplot coupled with higher production, showed general stability in all environments. The best genotypes for the respective environments were also determined. Using the GGE biplot, genotypes G2, G3, G11 and G12 were more stable in all environments. Therefore, on the basis of all analytical methods, three local genotypes, G2 (Karaj), G3 (Marand) and G11 (Qazvin), and a foreign genotype, G14 (from, USA), were identified as most suitable genotypes for breeding improved varieties and cultivation in the study locations and similar areas.

Stability of grain yield performance of 18 barley genotypes was evaluated at 5 locations for 3 years in the rainfed conditions and it was studied through 25 nonparametric stability methods. Four nonparametric tests indicated highly significant GE interaction due to differential performance of genotypes across fifteen environments. Regarding mean yield and six Hiihn's statistics, genotype G12 (1946 kg ha(-1)) was the most favorable genotype while based on the RN1, G4, G10 and Gll were the most stable genotypes. Genotypes G4, G8 and G10 were the most favorable genotypes according to rank-sum while genotypes G2, G13 and G18 were the most favorable genotypes based on nonparametric superiority. The relative interactivity index identified G4, G16 and G8 as the most stable genotypes while the genotypic classification identified G1, G2, G13 and G18 as the most stable genotypes. Clustering of the nonparametric stability methods indicated that there were two groups with different static and dynamic characteristics. In this study, five nonparametric stability methods as GC, FM, PA, RN2 and KR2 were associated with high grain yield and reflected the dynamic concept of stability, but the other twenty nonparametric stability methods were not positively correlated with yield and characterized a static concept of stability. Finally, genotypes genotype G13 (2114.13 kg ha(-1)) and G18 (2062.69 kg ha(-1)) were found to be the most favorable genotypes and are thus recommended for commercial release in semiarid areas of Iran.																			1222-4227						2022	39																							WOS:000791381600028

The present study addresses the need for inter-regional comparative studies that account for different geographic, climate, and socio-economic contexts in order to understand how pastoralists adapt to changes in livelihood conditions. The paper uses data from a unique survey study of pastoralist households in four neighbouring counties in dryland Kenya. Taking our point of departure from an empirically based classification of the livelihood strategies available to pastoralists in the Horn of Africa, the survey offers novel insights into adaptation and fodder management strategies of pastoralist individuals and households. The results show that the use of migration as a strategy is more dependent on the ability to migrate than climate conditions. This is the case in localities where a substantial part of the land is subdivided, the population density is high, and where opportunities for migration are subsequently restricted. Diversification of livelihoods as a strategy is largely defined by opportunity. Intensification through active fodder management is mainly common in areas where there has been a proliferation of managed enclosures. Climate change will test the adaptive capacity of pastoralists in the studied region, and diversification and intensification strategies of both herd composition and livelihoods can be seen as strategies for increased climate resilience.

However, the impact of deep root water uptake on photosynthesis is still not fully understood. An experiment partitioning deep soil and roots (below 200 cm) was undertaken at a dryland apple (Malus pumila Mill.) tree plantation on the Loess Plateau of China to examine the photosynthetic responses of apple trees to deep soil water deficit by characterizing seasonal changes in stomatal and nonstomatal limitation across years. It was evident that deep soil water deficit led to severe water stress. In the partitioned treatment, leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf, 28-58 %) and midday leaf water potential (psi md, 14-44 %) significantly decreased without adjustment, even in the wet season. Deep soil water deficit significantly impacted stomatal limitation by imposing average reductions of stomatal conductance (gs), photosynthesis rate (A), and transpi-ration rate (T) by 38 %, 26 %, and 34 % while increasing leaf water use efficiency (WUE) by 36 %, during the dry seasons; however, these parameters recovered well in the wet season. In contrast, no significant differences in nonstomatal limitation occurred between treatments, despite the trees suffering from severe drought stress. These results indicate that deep soil water deficit affected photosynthesis by reducing stomatal conductance but not by damaging the photosynthetic apparatus even under severe drought.

Understanding the long-term effects of expanding orchards and the responses of soil water dynamics to drought are important for orchard management. Therefore, we use a space-for-time substitution to investigate the variations of plant-available water storage in returning cropland to orchards with different stand ages (2, 6, 10, and 15 years) in a normal year (NY2014, 442.1 mm rainfall) and the next year with low annual precipitation (DY2015, 388 mm rainfall). The results showed that the plant-available water storage in jujube orchards decreased with increasing stand age, and the trend was most obvious in the 60-180 cm layer. The mature stands (10 and 15 years) primarily absorbed soil water from the deep layer (180-300 cm) in DY2015, leading to negative values of plant-available water storage. The whole soil profiles were all subjected to severe water deficits in our study.

It was previously shown that co-overexpression of the Arabidopsis vacuolar pyrophosphatase geneAVP1and the rice SUMO E3 ligase geneOsSIZ1in Arabidopsis significantly increased tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses and led to increased seed yield for plants grown under single or multiple abiotic stress conditions. It was hypothesized that there might be synergistic effects betweenAVP1overexpression andOsSIZ1overexpression, which could lead to substantially increased yields if these two genes are co-overexpressed in real crops. To test this hypothesis,AVP1andOsSIZ1were co-overexpressed in cotton, and the impact ofOsSIZ1/AVP1co-overexpression on cotton's performance under normal growth and multiple stress conditions were analysed. It was found thatOsSIZ1/AVP1co-overexpressing plants performed significantly better thanAVP1-overexpressing,OsSIZ1-overexpressing and wild-type cotton plants under single, as well as under multiple stress conditions in laboratory and field conditions. Two field studies showed thatOsSIZ1/AVP1co-overexpressing plants produced 133% and 81% more fibre than wild-type cotton in the dryland conditions of West Texas. This research illustrates that co-overexpression ofAVP1andOsSIZ1is a viable strategy for engineering abiotic stress-tolerant crops and could substantially improve crop yields in low input or marginal environments, providing a solution for food security for countries in arid and semiarid regions of the world.

The Loess Plateau is an ecologically fragile area; LULC changes in this region have complex impacts on habitat quality at multiple spatiotemporal scales. This study developed an integrated assessment method based on multi-source data to assess habitat quality changes in the Loess Plateau during recent years (2000-2015) and in the future (2015-2050) under four typical scenarios. A significant increase in urban land use was observed on the Loess Plateau from 2000 to 2050, which resulted in a continuous decrease in the cropland area. The area of forest and grassland landscapes was also reduced by both urban and cropland expansion, with the most significant loss in the grasslands. A future overall decreasing trend in overall habitat quality is predicted, but the SSP1-2.6 scenario is significantly better than the SSP5-8.5 scenario. Urban expansion contributes a rapidly increasing proportion of habitat quality decline on the Loess Plateau; urban land will become the most significant threat to regional habitat quality by 2030. Policies for socio-ecological protection with clear, high-level objectives can effectively promote habitat quality. It is recommended that national nature reserves be delineated and ecological functions in the study area be continuously monitored. This research provides a potential socio-ecological baseline and implementation strategy for the habitat conservation-oriented management of large and fragile ecological regions.

Ryan; Kallenbach, Robert L.; Yuan, Zhiyou			Aridity determines the effects of warming on community stability in Inner Mongolian grassland	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Ongoing climate warming affects biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of climate warming on biodiversity-stability relationships are unclear. Whether these effects depend on environmental factors such as aridity remains an open question. Here, we conducted a factorial field experiment to investigate the effects of warming on nine grasslands in a transect spanning similar to 1500 km with increasing aridity in Inner Mongolia, China. Our results showed that warming-induced decrease in species richness did not alter community variability across nine grasslands. However, species richness was negatively related to community variability under warming conditions, but not under control conditions. This indicated that warming regulated the species diversity-stability relationship. Warming increased species synchrony, species variability, and dominant species variability. These outcomes lead to increases in temporal variability of community productivity. Climate fluctuation increased species variability and species synchrony within communities, thereby reducing community stability. Importantly, the size of warming effects on community variability via biotic mechanisms grew with increasing aridity. Our results indicate that species diversity plays a crucial role in regulating community stability under climate warming. Our findings reveal the generality of biotic mechanisms responsible for grassland stability under future climate warming, and highlight that the geographic variation in aridity determines the effect sizes of warming on grassland stability. We suggest that ongoing and future climate warming might disrupt grasslands stability with high aridity, thereby reducing ecosystem functions and services.																			0168-1923	1873-2240				FEB 15	2023	329								109274	10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.109274	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.109274		DEC 2022											WOS:000899800900005

The long-term impact of tillage practices [conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT1) and reduced tillage + herbicide application (RT2)] and nitrogen sources [100% recommended dose of nitrogen (RDN) through compost (N-1), 50% RDN through compost and 50% through urea (N-2) and 100% RDN through urea (N-3)] in maize-wheat system was evaluated for soil properties, nutrient uptake and crop productivity. The results highlighted that RT2 significantly resulted in 10% higher soil organic carbon (SOC), 13% phosphorus and 5% bulk density than CT whereas RT1 had significantly higher available nitrogen (3%) and infiltration rate (43%) than CT. However, potassium declined significantly in reduced tillage treatments than CT. Compost application (N-1) significantly increased SOC, nitrogen, potassium and infiltration but reduced bulk density than N-2 and N-3. Reduced tillage + herbicide application with integrated nutrient management (RT2 and N-2) significantly resulted in higher grain yield (3896 and 3469 kg ha(-)(1)) and water use efficiency (7.81 and 14.68 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)) in maize and wheat, respectively. The treatment, RT2 significantly resulted in higher net returns in maize ((sic) 34512) and wheat ((sic) 38134) than CT and RT1. In maize, the highest net returns ((sic) 31170) were recorded in N-2, whereas in wheat N-3 ((sic) 34882) performed better than N-1 and N-2. The results imply that long-term reduced tillage and nitrogen through integrated nutrient management improve soil properties, nutrient uptake and crop productivity under rainfed conditions.

While it is logical that host lineage must have some effect on the phyllosphere habitat, it is unclear if phyllospheres harbor similar microbial core communities across multiple ecosystems at the continental-scale. Here we collected 287 phyllosphere bacterial communities from seven ecosystems (including paddy field, dryland, urban area, protected agricultural land, forest, wetland, and grassland) in east-China to identify the regional core community and to characterize the importance of such communities in maintaining phyllosphere bacterial community structure and function. Despite significantly different bacterial richness and structure, the seven studied ecosystems contained a similar regional core community of 29 OTUs that comprised 44.9 % of the total bacterial abundance. The regional core community was less affected by environmental variables and less connected in the co-occurrence network compared with other non-core OTUs (the whole minus regional core community). Furthermore, the regional core community also had a large proportion (>50 %) of a constrained set of nutrient metabolism related functional potentials and less functional redundancy. This study suggests there is a robust regional core phyllosphere community regardless of ecosystem or spatial and environmental heterogeneity, and supports the argument that core communities are pivotal in maintaining microbial community structure and function.

Thus, the biochemistry of Se in living organisms must be studied in-depth to determine the underlying mechanism of Se cytotoxicity. In this study, we report the emergence of selenium nanovirus (SeNVs) in selenite-exposed fish (freshwater and saltwater) and plants (dryland) and its toxicity in them. SeNVs were found in both the abdomen and tail of Oryzias melastigma and saltwater Rhodeus ocellatus, which led to their death. The occurrence of the intracellular assembly of SeNVs was observed in the roots and leaves of corn Zea mays, but not in those of Limnobium laevigatum. SeNVs led to the death of Z. mays but caused chronic toxicity in L. laevigatum. SeNVs should be a system or structure that dissipates the intracellular redox gradients of the host cells, with simple information consisting Se-O, Se- N, or Se-S bond, that would ensure elemental Se ligand binding with nearly specific biomolecules in host cells, thereby maintaining their composition and stabilizing their structure. The multiple toxic effects of Se, therefore, could be the consequence of increase of entropy in the host cells caused by the intracellular assembly of SeNVs. This study may provide an insight into the underlying mechanism of Se in environmental toxicology and its applications in human health.

In arid and semiarid regions, freshwater resources are imperative for the survival of populations as well as development activities in urban centres. Preceding assessments for potential solutions have underestimated the scarcity of water by failing to capture main trends of precipitation and the extent of drought periods. This paper aims to investigate rainfall trends for the City of Windhoek, Namibia. A century scale is examined by reconstructing historical precipitation records, and future trends are subsequently estimated and interpolated using Ordinary Kriging in ArcGIS 10.3. Kriging responds and handles spatial correlation much better for observed data points. The results show locations that receive high rainfall and potential periods for harvesting rainwater. The findings further show that the periods of high rainfall are shorter, and after each high rainfall stretch, a long period of lower rainfall follows immediately. Each low rainfall period is anticipated to last longer than the previous one. These scenarios are highly significant for urban managers in dryland cities such as Windhoek, as they demonstrate when water would need to be extra sparingly managed. This study highlights the need for better water management strategies, if cities in dry climates are to survive the anticipated future water crises.

Does Increasing the Diversity of Small Grain Cropping Systems Improve Aggregate Stability and Soil Hydraulic Properties?	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Wheat (Triticum aestivium L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) are two commonly grown cereal crops in the northern Great Plains. Adding other crops such as field pea (Pisum Sativum L.), canola (Brassica napus L.), or camelina (Camelina sativa L.) to wheat or barley cropping systems may improve soil quality. However, little is known about the effects of including oilseeds in small grain cropping systems on soil physical properties. We sampled an 8-year dryland study with 10 different cropping systems including continuous spring wheat, continuous winter wheat, continuous barley, pea-spring wheat, pea-barley, pea-winter wheat, pea-barley-camelina-spring wheat, pea-barley-canola-spring wheat, pea-winter wheat-camelina-spring wheat and pea-winter wheat-canola-spring wheat. We measured dry aggregate stability, wet aggregate stability, water retention, hydraulic conductivity, bulk density and total carbon. Continuous barley and winter wheat had a higher fraction of large dry soil aggregates, whereas the pea-barley-canola-spring wheat and pea-spring wheat cropping systems had a higher fraction of small aggregates in the 0-15 cm depth. However, wet aggregate stability, water retention, bulk density, hydraulic conductivity and soil carbon concentration were not affected by the cropping system in the 0-15 cm depth. Diversifying small grain cropping systems by adding canola or camelina oil seeds and peas generally did not affect soil physical properties at this location.

A simulation experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of N fertilizer application rate and residue retention on soil N dynamics. The simulation used seven N fertilizer application rates (0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150 and 200 kg N ha(-1)) to wheat (Triticum aestivum) over 27 years (1990-2016) at four locations across a gradient in annual rainfall in Victoria, Australia. Nitrogen immobilization, denitrification and N leaching loss were predicted and collectively defined as sources of N inefficiency. When residues were retained, immobilization was predicted to be the biggest source of inefficiency at all simulated sites at N application rates currently used by growers. Leaching became a bigger source of inefficiency at one site with low soil water-holding capacity, but only at N rates much higher than would currently be commercially applied, resulting in high levels of nitrate (NO3-) accumulating in the soil. Denitrification was an appreciable source of inefficiency at higher rainfall sites. Further research is necessary to evaluate strategies to minimize immobilization of N in semi-arid cropping systems.

Water Productivity of Selected Sorghum Genotypes Under Rainfed Conditions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION												Water productivity (WP) is becoming a key issue in understanding the relationship between water availability and rainfed sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) yields in agricultural systems across sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this study was to determine water productivity of three sorghum genotypes under different environmental conditions. Three sorghum genotypes, a hybrid (PAN8816), a commercial open-pollinated variety (Macia) and a landrace (Ujiba) were planted at two sites (Ukulinga and Mbumbulu) in South Africa during 2013/2014 and 2014/2015. High clay content in Mbumbulu lowered plant available water in the soil compared to Ukulinga. Sorghum adapted to low water availability by significantly (P < 0.05) lowering plant growth (green leaf number, plant height and canopy cover), crop physiology (chlorophyll content index and stomatal conductance), biomass and grain yield. Ujiba and PAN8816 genotypes hastened phenological development, whilst Macia delayed phenological development in response to low water availability. Total and grain WP were lower at Mbumbulu (14.93 and 7.49 kg/ha/mm) relative to Ukulinga (21.49 and 11.01 kg/ha/mm), respectively. Results showed that Macia had significantly higher (P < 0.05) WP (10.51 kg/ha/mm) relative to PAN8816 (9.34 kg/ha/mm) and Ujiba (7.90 kg/ha/mm). Lack of significant genotypic differences in grain WP highlights that all three genotypes are equally suitable for production under sub-optimal and dryland conditions.

Varieties	MOLECULES												Salinity stress limited the production in over 30% of irrigated crops and 7% of dryland agriculture worldwide. The objective was to evaluate the effects of NaCl-stress on the enzymatic activity in tomato. Two experiments were carried out in germination and early vegetative growth stages. The activity of proline and peroxidase of eight varieties (Missouri, Yaqui, Vita, Feroz, Rio Grande, Tropic, Ace, and Floradade) submitted to NaCl concentrations (0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 mM de NaCl) and the semi-quantitative activity of 19 enzymes APY ZYM((R)) were measured under a completely randomized design with four replications. Data were analyzed using univariate-multivariate analysis of variance, Tukey's HSD (p = 0.05), canonical discriminant and cluster analysis. The results showed significant differences between varieties and NaCl in proline content. Proline increased as the NaCl concentration increased. Peroxidase did no show significant differences. Eight enzymes were included within the model to properly classify the varieties and NaCl. In shoots, varieties and NaCl showed that enzymatic activity was higher in the order of alkaline-phosphatase > leucine arylamidase > acid phosphatase > naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase > n-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase > beta-galactosidase, while in roots was higher in the order of alkaline-phosphatase > naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase > acid phosphatase > n-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase. Acid and alkali phosphatase, lipase, esterase, beta-galactosidase, and trypsin can be a potential biomarker for NaCl-stress tolerance in tomato.

Hydroclimatic and geochemical palaeoenvironmental records within tufa: A cool-water fluvio-lacustrine tufa system in the Wadi Dabsa volcanic setting, western Saudi Arabia	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												A series of uncharacterised tufa deposits within the lowland volcanic provinces of western Saudi Arabia are investigated here in order to account for their presence and to examine their utility as a palaeoenvironmental archive. The Wadi Dabsa basin, in the Harrat Al Birk, is part of the Saharo-Arabian region, where there is increasing evidence for multiple hominin dispersals during windows of reduced aridity during the last ~400 ka of the Late Quaternary. This first and detailed petrological and geochemical characterisation of these tufa carbonates is particularly important for palaeoenvironmental and climatological reconstruction at a site that contains a major concentration of Early and Middle Stone Age artefacts. We aim to determine the nature of deposition, to answer whether these are cool, freshwater tufa or hydrothermal travertine, and to establish what the tufa settings, stratigraphies and facies reveal about the hydroclimatic regime in this semi-arid environment. A widespread lacustrine-paludal and fluvial tufa system is preserved, as well as topographically-controlled tufa barrages and cascades. Observable sections, exposed by incision, reveal a thickness of tufa deposits of 3 to 6 m in places, which contain two packages of tufa-cemented conglomerate facies. This allows us to provide a conceptual model for the deposition of semi-arid tufa, based on existing type sites in the Naukluft Mountains of Namibia and the Ebro Basin of Spain. The varied topography within this volcanic harrat provides a setting at Wadi Dabsa that combines the low-lying lacustrine-paludal model from Spain with the steeper and higher-energy model from Namibia. The two tufa-cemented bedload units and the evidence for post-depositional erosion of other tufa facies indicates a shifting hydroclimatic regime, with episodes during which the basin contained water and there was steady flow in the fluvial channels, alternating with episodes of high-energy flashy flows. Geochemical analysis using Sr-87/Sr-86 isotopic ratios (0.7049 to 0.7056 with one sample at 0.7062) and stable carbon isotopes (-12.9 to-6.3 parts per thousand) reveal that these are cool-water tufas were deposited from meteoric water that has interacted with both metamorphosed limestone in the Asir Escarpment and the mafic metavolcanic bedrock of the Wadi Dabsa Basin, without a geothermal influence. These tufa are low-concentration-magnesium calcite, with traces of quartz (to a maximum of 3%) and other silicates. Some samples have <= 7.5% palygorskite, which along with petrological evidence for microbial filaments suggests the importance of biomineralisation by cyanobacteria within some of these tufa. Petrological analysis shows the fabrics are dominated by micrite cements with some microspar, and very little post-depositional alteration. Where samples are banded, this reflects variation in calcite crystal size as opposed to any striking variations in mineralogical composition. Oxygen stable isotopic composition (-14.6 to-1.9 parts per thousand) indicates deposition from an isotopically more depleted rainfall source than the modern day, noting additional corrections for unknown past temperature and any other fractionation effects are needed. Depleted rainfall sources in this region may relate to either a far-travelled Atlantic moisture source or a higher-intensity Indian Ocean monsoon source, or some combination. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

J	Turner, MD; Ayantunde, A				Turner, Matthew D.; Ayantunde, Augustine			Household diversification and market dependence: understanding vulnerability in rural West Africa	JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES												Understanding the empirical relationships among three parameters is necessary to reduce household vulnerability: diversification, market dependence and economic security. A cross-sectional study of these relationships was conducted in five areas with histories of cash cropping in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and northern Nigeria. Household diversification was found to be positively associated with economic security while negatively associated with household dependence on markets. Moreover, individuals in market oriented households are more likely to adopt individualistic orientations. These findings confirm a positive role of diversification but raise concerns about how markets affect the prospects for maintaining or reducing household vulnerability.																			0306-6150	1743-9361				NOV 10	2022	49	7					1497	1523		10.1080/03066150.2021.1936505	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2021.1936505		AUG 2021											WOS:000685938300001
J	Song, DX; Ma, L; Wang, QJ				Song, Dianxing; Ma, Li; Wang, Quanjiu			Photosynthetic light response models for spring wheat mulching treatments in a northwestern China desert oasis	CROP SCIENCE												In the desert oasis areas of northwestern China, mulching treatments are an effective method for alleviating drought in agricultural production. Four mulching treatments of polyacrylamide (PAM), which is a water retention agent; plastic film; stones; straw; plus an unmulched control treatment were used in the field to explore their influence on soil water content (SWC), soil temperature, the net photosynthetic rate (P-n), leaf area index (LAI), and yield in spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Six light response models were used to simulate the light response of wheat. A significant difference was found between straw and the control vs. the other mulching treatments in terms of grain yield and yield components of spring wheat (p < .05). Under the film treatment, the yield increased by 9.8-16.9% and the water use efficiency (WUE) increased by 20% in 2012 and 23% in 2013. Compared with PAM, stone, straw, and the control, the film mulch had the largest maximum photosynthesis and the largest rate of light adaptation. The nonrectangular hyperbolic had the smallest error and simulated the best photosynthetic light response. Compared with the control treatment, the soil temperatures were reduced by a mean of 8.5-11.3 degrees C and the average SWC increased by 5.5-3.2% under all mulching treatments. However, SWC had a greater effect on P-n than soil temperature during the growth season under the mulching treatments, which increased yield in this arid environment. Film mulching was the best mulching treatment for spring wheat in this desert oasis.																			0011-183X	1435-0653				MAY	2021	61	3					2036	2047		10.1002/csc2.20428	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/csc2.20428		APR 2021											WOS:000640537500001

Improvement of sandy soil properties, especially for soil water related properties, is therefore vital for successful revegetation. In this study, montmorillonite-enriched siltstone (MS), a type of fine particle soil material, was used to improve sandy soil in a field experiment with four volume proportions: 0% (M-0%), 25% (M-25%), 75% (M-75%), and 100% (M-100%) of MS, which was then planted with alfalfa (Medicago sativa) for 3 years. The objective was to investigate the improvement effect of MS on the physical properties of sandy soil and its support for plant growth. The results showed that the addition of MS significantly increased the soil physical quality (SPQ) indicators, such as available water capacity (AWC), which increased from 7.39% (M-0%) to 10.18% (M-100%), while hydraulic conductivity (Ks) decreased by 34.1% (M-25%) and 57.5% (M-75%), and bulk soil air capacity (ACB) decreased by 12.6% (M-25%) and 39.4% (M-75%). These results were mainly related to the high content of fine particles in MS, such as montmorillonite, a 2:1 clay mineral. The average profile soil water content (SWC) increased from 9.20% to 14.08% (M-25%) and 24.62% (M-75%). The temporal stability of SWC was also significantly increased by MS addition, while drainage was significantly decreased. Both above-ground biomass (ABG) and water use efficiency (WUE) increased by approximately two times in M-25% and M-75% in 2015 and five times in M-25% and M-75% in 2016. This result verified the positive effect of MS addition on sandy soil properties. However, more than 75% MS addition (such as M-100%) in sandy soil decreased ACB to less than 15% and decreased ABG by 75.3% compared with that of M-75%. This study gives a new strategy for improving sandy soil using local finer materials with a high content of montmorillonite. Considering the improvement effects and engineering cost, a 25% volume proportion of MS was recommended.

The use of controlled-release fertilizers (CRF) can decrease greenhouse gas emissions. However, the general patterns and variability of nitrogen functional genes in response to CRF associated with N2O emission have not been synthesized under climate change.MethodsWe investigated the effects of CRF, elevated CO2 concentration (EC), elevated temperature (ET), and their combination on N2O emission, enzyme activities and gene abundances.ResultsWe found that the cumulative N2O emissions was in the range of 0.39-1.65 kg center dot ha(-1) in the wheat-growing season, accounting for 0.54%-2.29% of the total nitrogen input. N2O emissions were considerably positively correlated with ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) at elongation stage. CRF inputs significantly decreased N2O emissions by 29 - 66% compared with urea due to decreased AOB abundance and inhibited nitrite reductase activities at elongation stage. EC significantly decreased N2O emissions by 30 - 50% likely resulting from the inhibition in nitrifying and denitrifying community compared with ambient CO2 concentration. ET significantly increased N2O emissions by increasing N mineralization in wheat soil under CRF due to higher NH4+-N and NO3--N concentration in wheat soil at elongation stage. In addition, ECET had antagonistic effect on N2O emissions. CRF had no significant effect on wheat yield under climate change scenarios.ConclusionsCRF decreased the cumulative N2O emissions under climate change scenarios. This is critical for understanding the responses of N2O emissions from wheat soil under CRF to future CO2 enrichment and warming for the establishment of mitigation and adaptation policies.																			0032-079X	1573-5036				JUL	2023	488	1-2			SI		343	361		10.1007/s11104-023-05972-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-023-05972-1		MAR 2023											WOS:000946809800002

In this paper, we use a case study of chickpea and lentil production in Ethiopia and a gendered lens to identify other determinants of farmers' decisions for the adoption of improved legume varieties. Mixed methods were used to collect sex and age disaggregated data through 360 household surveys, 11 focus group discussions, and 8 key informant interviews. The analysis focused on key adoption parameters, including access to land, labor, improved seed varieties, fertilizers, pesticides, agriculture information, and credit. The main challenges identified include: differential access to timely and adequate seeds of improved varieties, quality fertilizers, and pesticides; availability of credit at an affordable interest rate; and equitable access to information. As compared to men, we found women's access to these resources to be low and women's cost production to be relatively high. Farmland remains a main constraint for the youth. Farmers responded to the challenges by recycling seeds and mono-cropping lentils, despite declining soil and crop productivity, and increased occurrence of pests and diseases. In the case of chickpea, we found that cultural norms also discouraged the adoption of the improved variety.

Palaeoflood records to assist in design of civil infrastructure in ephemeral rivers with scarce hydrological data: Ugab River, Namibia	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: A flood study was performed in the ephemeral Ugab River in the arid north-western part of Namibia. The headwaters of the river lie on the higher Namibian plateau, where most floods are generated and propagate west, through the Namib desert, to the Atlantic Ocean. Study focus: Estimation of a 1 % Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) flood is required for upgrading of road infrastructure. In compliance with revised road standards, the existing Ugab River bridge needs to accommodate the 1 % flood or be replaced at a high cost. From hydraulic modelling it was determined that the bridge can accommodate a similar to 2000 m(3)s(-1) flood. The Regional Maximum Flood model estimates the 1 % flood at similar to 3600 m(3)s(-1) while a Flood Frequency Analysis (FFA), based on short term systematic data, predicts the flood at -550 m(3)s(-1). This inconsistency needed to be resolved. Incorporation of palaeoflood discharges (14 floods over the last 1260 years) into the FFA produced a 1 % flood of similar to 820 m(3)s(-1), indicating that the existing bridge has sufficient flood capacity. New hydrological insights for the region: This study shows that palaeoflood hydrology improves conventional hydrological methods in dryland regions, providing long-term registers for reliable estimation of FFA. This is especially applicable to regions with complex hydrology or with scarce gauged discharges, or where data is simply unavailable.

J	Guan, C; Chen, N; Dong, XX; Wei, XL; Zhao, CM				Guan, Chao; Chen, Ning; Dong, Xiaoxue; Wei, Xiaolong; Zhao, Changming			Responses of biological soil crusts to different types of vegetation restoration on the Chinese Loess Plateau: a case study	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are important components of dryland ecosystems. Vegetation strongly affects the distribution of biocrusts by influencing the soil stability, moisture and light availability. The Loess Plateau has been subjected to large-scale restoration efforts; however, the type, coverage, and biomass of biocrusts responses to different types of vegetation restoration remain uncertain. Here, we investigated the biocrust characteristics (type, coverage, thickness, biomass, dominant cryptogam species, and relative abundance of major cyanobacteria and algae) in areas restored with different types of vegetation (Caragana korshinskii, Platycladus orientalis, Armeniaca sibirica, Populus hopeiensis, Pinus tabuliformis, Tamarix chinensis) and in a natural grassland on the Loess Plateau. Our results showed that the coverage, thickness, and biomass of the biocrusts were higher in the natural grassland than in the afforested areas, which suggests that the natural grassland is more suitable than the afforested areas for biocrust distribution. The biocrusts were composed mainly of mosses in the Pi. tabuliformis area and of cyanobacteria and algae in most of the other vegetation restoration areas. However, no biocrusts were observed in the T. chinensis area, probably because the dense canopy prevented light from reaching the soil. In addition, soil properties influenced by vegetation restoration may also affect the characteristics of biocrusts. Overall, our study suggests that natural grassland recovery, rather than afforestation, is likely the most suitable method for the development of biocrusts and provides suggestions for restoration and reconstruction on the Loess Plateau.																			1061-2971	1526-100X				MAY	2023	31	4								10.1111/rec.13805	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.13805		OCT 2022											WOS:000870437800001

EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PROTECTED AREAS: CONCEPTS, METHODS AND CHALLENGERUNOFF AND WATER BALANCE IN DRYLANDS WITH COMPLEX TOPOGRAPHY - SACO CREEK WATERSHED - PERNAMBUCO	GEOGRAPHIA-UFF												In Brazil, there is still lack of data on the runoff small semi-arid basins, especially for basins that present significant altimetric variations, given the lack of detail in the climatic dat Accordingly this research examined the relationship rain/runoff through Daily Sequential Water Balance methodology, of Saco Creek Watershed, Pernambuco central dryland. The watershed presents a complex relief with altimetric variation of 700 meters between the river mouth (409m) and the headwaters (above 1.100m), that directly reflect in the climatic characteristics, principally in the precipitation variation. The daily water balance was performed using four PCD, landcover map and soil map. These three data was integrated creating 24 uniform zones of precipitation/soil/landcover, and the analysis was undertaken to each one of them. Looking to the results, it is clear the importance of PCD Triunfo altimetric zone, where despite representing only 25,6% of the watershed it represents for more than 37% of water volume collect by watershed, 46,31% of all basin runoff. This area is the main collect water source from watershed. It is necessary to remember that the high runoff percentage is directly tied to widespread agricultural use, and the high runoff rates lead to loss of water and sediment Therefore, it is clear the necessity to increase the infiltration levels order for the water be retained and move as base flow, prolonging the residence time in the landscape.

For these reasons, introducing alternative roughage feeds, such as nutritionally improved forages or bio-chemically treated straw, is essential for improving milk yield, dietary nitrogen utilization, and reducing enteric methane emission from dairy cows. Thus, we evaluated the effects of natural pasture hay, two improved grass hays (Napier andBrachiariahybrid grasses), and treated teff straw silage feeding as basal diets on nutrient digestibility, milk yield, nitrogen utilization efficiency, and enteric methane emissions using lactating Fogera dairy cows. Our results showed that improved grass hays and treated teff straw silage diet feeding increased milk yield, nutrient digestibility, and nitrogen utilization efficiency as compared to natural pasture hay. Moreover, the cows fed with improved grass hays and treated teff straw resulted in changing the nitrogen excretion pathway from urine to feces, as well as reduction of the methane production per daily milk yield. Hence, these results provide a novel feeding regimen through feeding nutritionally upgraded forages as a basal diet, which improves milk yield, nutrient utilization efficiency, and reduction of methane emission for sustainable dairy production in tropical regions. The nutritionally imbalanced poor-quality diet feeding is the major constraint of dairy production in tropical regions. Hence, alternative high-quality roughage-based diets are required to improve milk yield and reduce methane emission (CH4). Thus, we tested the effects of feeding natural pasture hay, improved forage grass hays (Napier andBrachiariaHybrid), and treated crop residues (Eragrostis tefstraw) on nutrient digestibility, milk yield, nitrogen balance, and methane emission. The eight lactating Fogera cows selected for the experiment were assigned randomly to a 4 x 4 Latin square design. Cows were housed in well-ventilated individual pens and fed a total mixed ration (TMR) comprising 70% roughage and 30% concentrate. The four roughage-based basal dietary treatments supplemented with formulated concentrate were: Control (natural pasture hay (NPH)); treated teff straw silage (TTS); Napier grass hay (NGH); andBrachiariahybrid grass hay (BhH). Compared with the control diet, the daily milk yield increased (p< 0.01) by 31.9%, 52.9%, and 71.6% with TTS, NGH, and BhH diets, respectively. Cows fed BhH had the highest dry matter intake (8.84 kg/d), followed by NGH (8.10 kg/d) and TTS (7.71 kg/d); all of these intakes were greater (p= 0.01) than that of NPH (6.21 kg/d). Nitrogen digestibility increased (p < 0.01) from the NPH diet to TTS (by 27.7%), NGH (21.7%), and BhH (39.5%). The concentration of ruminal ammonia nitrogen was higher for cows fed NGH than other diets (p= 0.01) and positively correlated with plasma urea nitrogen concentration (R-2 = 0.45). Feeding TTS, NGH, and BhH hay as a basal diet changed the nitrogen excretion pathway from urine to feces, which can help protect against environmental pollution. Estimated methane yields per dry matter intake and milk yield were decreased in dairy cows fed BhH, NGH, and TTS diets when compared to cows fed an NPH diet (p< 0.05). In conclusion, feeding of TTS, NGH, and BhH roughages as a basal diet to lactating dairy cows in tropical regions improved nutrient intake and digestibility, milk yield, nitrogen utilization efficiency, and reduced enteric methane emission.

Here, we investigated six vegetation types that covered two succession stages (early and late stages) during forest development. The early stage showed changes from two pioneer communities (Benda plaryphylla and Populus davidicma) to two mixed communities (Populus davidiana with Pinus tabuliformis), while the late stage showed changes from the two mixed communities to two climax communities (Quercus wutaishanica and Pinus tabuliformis). Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and ITS gene were carried out to analyze soil microbial (bacterial and fungal) diversity and composition. Soil properties (i.e., moisture, bulk density, texture, ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus) were also determined. The results showed that forest development had positive effects on microbial diversity. Particularly, bacterial diversity successions proceed faster than that of fungi at the early stage. Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes significantly increased, but Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria significantly decreased during forest development. In contrast, the effect sizes of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria at the early stage were larger than those at the late stage. The dominant fungi phyla (i.e., Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Zygomycota) across all soil samples responded insignificantly to forest development Such differential responses of the microbial diversity and dominant phyla were significantly correlated with soil texture, soil organic carbon, and total nitrogen. In contrast, the effect size of soil properties on bacterial phyla was larger than that on fungal phyla. Collectively, these results emphasize that the responses of the microbial community to forest development depend on the succession stage, and also suggest that bacteria and fungi may not follow the same successional trajectories due to the differed responses of bacteria and fungi to changing soil texture and carbon/nitrogen contents during forest development.

J	Liu, XY; Watts, RJ; Allan, C				Liu, Xiaoying; Watts, Robyn J.; Allan, Catherine			Local ecological knowledge and wise use of ephemeral wetlands: the case of the Cowal system, Australia	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Ephemeral wetlands are important ecologically but are often jurisdictionally complex and under-studied. Forms of local knowledge, including local ecological knowledge (LEK) and farmer knowledge, are increasingly recognised as able to complement other scientific knowledge for planning and management. This paper contributes to the discussion on the value and potential use of local knowledge by considering the Cowal system, an ephemeral wetland in dryland Australia. The Cowal system's hydrological regime is highly variable, with drying and wetting cycles influenced by distant rainfall events. There is limited historical scientific data available for the system. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with local landholders who privately own the land within the Cowal system. The aggregated results showcase their knowledge and understanding of the ecological functions of the Cowal system, highlight some current ephemeral wetland management activities and indicate their concerns for the future. LEK is shown to be a valuable source of historical and planning data. For example, their combined memories and family records of the Cowal system provide the only historical record of the timeline of the wetland's filling and drying, and support their concerns about the alteration of the natural hydrological regime because of developments in the catchment area. The research suggests that LEK should be actively sought by scientists, managers, and planners of wetlands, especially where baseline and systems information is scant.																			0923-4861	1572-9834				DEC	2023	31	6					791	804		10.1007/s11273-023-09950-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-023-09950-3		SEP 2023											WOS:001065966800001

Biological soil crusts (BSCs or biocrusts), which cover a large part of soil surface in arid land, significantly affect the water redistribution, but the results are conflicting at regional scale. In this study, the effects of different biocrusts on soil hydraulic properties, including soil water retention curve, soil water sorptivity, soil hydrophobicity and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, were clarified in Tengger Desert. The results showed that the presence of BSCs significantly changed soil hydraulic properties. Compared to sand, BSCs increased water holding capacity and soil hydrophobicity, and decreased soil water sorptivity and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. The enrichment of fine particles during the change from the less to the more developed BSCs contributed to the enhancement of water holding capacity, but this effect was mainly limited at 3-cm layer of soil underneath the ground surface. Soil hydrophobicity decreased with crust development, which contributed to the increase of soil water sorptivity. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity decreased during the change from the less to the more developed BSCs, which exerted some negative effect on water infiltration. Our results highlight the important role of BSCs in hydraulic properties, and consideration of biocrusts and its hydrological behavior could help us better understand the distribution, movement and retention of soil water in this area.

Long-term growing season aridity and grazing seasonality effects on perennial grass biomass in a Chihuahuan Desert rangeland	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Growing season aridity and livestock grazing seasonality can influence primary productivity of perennial grasses in dryland systems. For this study, we used a long-term dataset (1967-2004) to investigate the independent and joint effects of growing season aridity and season of grazing (yearlong continuous, fall, winter/spring, or summer season grazing) on the mean annual primary productivity of the perennial grasses Bouteloua eriopoda (black grama), Aristida spp. (threeawn), and Sporobolus spp. (dropseed) in a southwestern United States Chihuahuan Desert rangeland system. Over the 37-year study period, total perennial grass biomass decreased as aridity increased, but the extent of this relationship depended upon season of grazing and specific grass taxon. Aridity-related decreases in total perennial grass biomass were most severe in the summer grazing treatment. Our findings indicate that over time, summer and fall grazing can potentially exacerbate the negative effects of increasing aridity on perennial grass biomass. As arid and semi-arid rangelands globally face increasing aridity associated with a changing climate, land managers can modulate the season of grazing, dependent on dominant taxa present, to minimize these effects. Our study and those from other arid land locations indicate continuous grazing at light to conservative intensities can better sustain key perennial grasses than strategies involving concentrated seasons of grazing. However, growing season aridity levels must also be taken into consideration.

Measuring reflectance of tiny organisms: The promise of species level biocrust remote sensing	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												1. To understand how ecological communities will respond to global change we need new tools and datasets on species across large spatial and temporal scales. Hyperspectral reflectance 'spectra' capture a promising set of traits that show potential to be scaled up in time and space via remote sensing. Thus far, spectra have been shown to distinguish the taxa and trait responses of a substantial number of species within a plethora of vascular plant communities, but not yet for biological soil crust communities (biocrusts). 2. Here, we assess if spectra can be applied to identify biocrust species and their trait variation. We collected biocrust specimens across an aridity gradient spanning 650 km within drylands of Eastern Australia and acquired their spectra, over 12,700 spectral readings, with a high-resolution radiospectrometer. A machine learning method (random forests) was used to assess how well the spectra of biocrust specimens could distinguish their species and broader structural and chemical traits. 3. Spectra were able to differentiate a substantial number of biocrust species (35) with considerable accuracy (similar to 78.5%). Furthermore, spectral features related to chemical traits were found to primarily drive species spectral differences. 4. Synthesis. Our findings establish that biocrust species hold unique and detectable spectral responses, providing an important basis for remote sensing applications on biocrust species and their trait responses across dryland systems.

Implications of Adoption of Zero Tillage (ZT) on Productive Efficiency and Production Risk of Wheat Production	SUSTAINABILITY												The impacts of zero tillage (ZT) on soil physical, biological, and chemical properties have been fairly documented in the literature. However, there is still an information gap in the developing world in general and in integrated crop-livestock production systems in dry areas of the world in particular. Using a sample of 621 farmers in Syria, this study assessed the implications of adoption of ZT technology on productive efficiency, input-specific resource use efficiency, and production risk. A stochastic production frontier model, which explicitly and simultaneously accounts for technical inefficiency and production risk, was used to estimate total factor and input-specific technical efficiencies and the risk of obtaining lower levels of yields for each of the sampled farms. Model results show that adoption of ZT proved to be an effective risk management strategy in this dryland production system, where it led to 95% and 33.3% reductions in the risk of obtaining wheat yield levels below 1000 kg/ha and 1500 kg/ha, respectively. Overall, the results have a clear indication that using ZT leads to improvements in productive efficiency as the adoption of ZT led to 93% reduction in the risk of obtaining efficiency levels below 40%. Future research will be needed to shed light on whether coupling ZT with the other components of conservation agriculture will reverse some of these effects.

Nutritional and mineral content of prickly pear cactus: A highly water-use efficient forage, fodder and food species	JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE												Increased demand for food requires us to investigate livestock forage and fodder crops that can be grown over a wide range of locations where their cultivation will not compete with that of the food supply. A large portion of the southwestern United States consists of underutilized semi-arid land. Crops typically used for livestock fodder or forage have high-water demands that make them uneconomical or unsustainable for semi-arid and arid regions. The growth rate and low-input requirements of prickly pear cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica) make it an excellent candidate for forage or fodder supplementation or replacement in these regions. Previous reports about forage quality data on Opuntia have been scattered across multiple locations, growing conditions and cultivars. Here, we report on the forage quality and mineral content of Opuntia ficus-indica grown under both field and greenhouse conditions. Crude protein was 71 and 264 g/kg of dry mass for field and greenhouse conditions, respectively. Field-grown plants showed higher acid and neutral detergent fibre content than greenhouse-grown plants reflecting higher cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin accumulation. Nutritional values were also compared to requirements of cattle to determine what deficiencies might need to be addressed through supplementation. These data suggest that Opuntia can be used in combination with other feed sources to reduce the demand of resource-intensive forage crops for raising livestock in dryland areas.

Phylogenetic, functional, and taxonomic richness have both positive and negative effects on ecosystem multifunctionality	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Biodiversity encompasses multiple attributes such as the richness and abundance of species (taxonomic diversity), the presence of different evolutionary lineages (phylogenetic diversity), and the variety of growth forms and resource use strategies (functional diversity). These biodiversity attributes do not necessarily relate to each other and may have contrasting effects on ecosystem functioning. However, how they simultaneously influence the provision of multiple ecosystem functions related to carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling (multifunctionality) remains unknown. We evaluated the effects of the taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional attributes of dominant (mass ratio effects) and subordinate (richness effect) plant species on the multifunctionality of 123 drylands from six continents. Our results highlight the importance of the phylogenetic and functional attributes of subordinate species as key drivers of multifunctionality. In addition to a higher taxonomic richness, we found that simultaneously increasing the richness of early diverging lineages and the functional redundancy between species increased multifunctionality. In contrast, the richness of most recent evolutionary lineages and the functional and phylogenetic attributes of dominant plant species (mass ratio effects) were weakly correlated with multifunctionality. However, they were important drivers of individual nutrient cycles. By identifying which biodiversity attributes contribute the most to multifunctionality, our results can guide restoration efforts aiming to maximize either multifunctionality or particular nutrient cycles, a critical step to combat dryland desertification worldwide.

However, few studies have determined the effects of sand plant residual on wind erosion resistance. Based on field surveys, the influences of Salix residual biomass of 200, 400, 600, and 800 g m(-2), soil incorporated with a residual thickness of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 cm, and typical proportion of residual branches and leaves (2:1, 1:1, and 1:2) on wind erosion resistance were investigated using a simulated wind tunnel. The results showed the following: 1) The soil loss amount ranged from 1.56 to 40.8 kg m(-2) as Salix residual biomass decreased from 800 to 0 g m(-2), with a critical residual biomass value of 400 g m(-2). 2) As the thickness of soil-incorporated residual increased, the soil loss amount reduced rapidly, especially for 0-9 cm above the surface accounting for 84.6% of the total. 3) Salix branch residual is more important in resisting soil wind erosion as compared with its leaves. This kind of study may provide theoretical explanations for the optimal reconstruction of sandy vegetation in the northern wind-sand regions.																				2296-665X				AUG 5	2021	9								574883	10.3389/fenvs.2021.574883	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.574883													WOS:000692732600001

The main purpose of this study was to identify and evaluate slope runoff and soil loss rates, and to review all of the plot-scale studies in the Chinese Loess Plateau, by meta-analysis. Based on data collected from the runoff plot, the effect of land use on annual runoff and annual soil loss under natural rainfall conditions was analyzed. The optimization of land use in different climatic regions of the Loess Plateau was evaluated. The plot database contained 55 plot measuring sites in the Loess Plateau, which included 461 runoff plots and 535 soil loss plots. Bare soil was found to have the highest average annual runoff (58.57 mm.yr(-1)) and annual soil loss (122.06 t.ha(-1).yr(-1)). Natural grassland and mixed forest had the lowest annual runoff (<15 mm.yr(-1)) and annual soil loss (<20 t.ha(-1).yr(-1)), exhibiting a better effect of soil and water conservation when the precipitation was <200 mm and >600 mm, respectively. When the precipitation was 400-600 mm, shrubland showed the lowest mean annual runoff (21.36 mm.yr(-1)) and annual soil loss (13.36 t.ha(-1).yr(-1)), which conducive to reducing water and sediment. Therefore, shrubland could be selected as the recovery vegetation type in the semi-humid climatic region. Land-use types determined the relationship between annual soil loss and annual runoff with plot length and slope gradient. These results enabled the assessment of the impact of land-use change on water erosion, providing a basis for formulating soil and water conservation management programs. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Inner Mongolia, as a typical dryland region in northern China, has carried out several large-scale ecological restoration programs to combat land degradation. However, there is a lack of comprehensive assess-ment of its land degradation situation after ecological programs implementation, which is of great significance to supporting SDG15.3 in China. This study analyzed the land degradation situation using the improved SDG15.3.1 calculation framework based on fine resolution data in Inner Mongolia from 2000 to 2020, and finally compre-hensively evaluated the land status of the whole region and those subject to ecological programs. The results show that net land restoration proportion of various ecological project regions and whole region continues to increase. The scope of the Grain for Green Program (GGP) had the largest proportion of net land restoration while the Natural Reserve Program (NRP) had the lowest proportion from 2000 to 2020. The net land restoration area of Inner Mongolia during 2000-2010 and 2010-2020 was 35,800 km2 and 65,300 km2, respectively. Overall, Inner Mongolia has achieved statistically zero growth in land degradation under the governance of ecological restora-tion programs. Therefore, reasonable planning, well monitoring, and timely assessment of ecological restoration programs are crucial to support SDG15.3.

Mechanical scarification technique breaks seed coat-mediated dormancy in wild oat (Avena fatua)	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Wild oat is a herbicide resistance-prone global weed species that causes significant economic losses in dryland and horticultural agriculture. As a result, there has been a significant research effort to control this species. A major impediment to this research is the seed coat-mediated dormancy of wild oat, which requires a labor-intensive incision or puncturing of the seed coat to initiate seed germination. This study defines the most efficient settings of a mechanical thresher to overcome wild oat seed dormancy and then validates these settings using multiple populations collected from the Western Australian grain belt. We also compare the effects of rapid mechanical scarification and known germination stimulus tactics such as scarification with sulfuric acid (H2SO4), partial endosperm removal, sandpaper scarification of the seed coat, and immersion in sodium nitroprusside (NO donor SNP) solution on wild oat seedling growth rate. Threshing treatment of 1,500 rpm for 5 s provides equivalent germination compared with manually puncturing individual wild oat seeds, with no difference in seedling relative growth rate. The mechanical scarification of seeds using the thresher resulted in greater germination (66%) than H2SO4 scarification (0%), partial endosperm removal (10%), sandpaper seed coat scarification (25%), and exposure to NO donor SNP (34%). This study demonstrates that the physical dormancy of wild oat can be rapidly overcome using a commercially available mechanical thresher.

G.; Houben, Andreas			Unequal contribution of two paralogous CENH3 variants in cowpea centromere function	COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY												In most diploids the centromere-specific histone H3 (CENH3), the assembly site of active centromeres, is encoded by a single copy gene. Persistance of two CENH3 paralogs in diploids species raises the possibility of subfunctionalization. Here we analysed both CENH3 genes of the diploid dryland crop cowpea. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that gene duplication of CENH3 occurred independently during the speciation of Vigna unguiculata. Both functional CENH3 variants are transcribed, and the corresponding proteins are intermingled in subdomains of different types of centromere sequences in a tissue-specific manner together with the kinetochore protein CENPC. CENH3.2 is removed from the generative cell of mature pollen, while CENH3.1 persists. CRISPR/Cas9-based inactivation of CENH3.1 resulted in delayed vegetative growth and sterility, indicating that this variant is needed for plant development and reproduction. By contrast, CENH3.2 knockout individuals did not show obvious defects during vegetative and reproductive development. Hence, CENH3.2 of cowpea is likely at an early stage of pseudogenization and less likely undergoing subfunctionalization. Takayoshi Ishii et al. report that two functional centromere-specific histone H3 (CENH3) paralogs with different centromere occupancy among different tissue types present in diploid cowpea. They demonstrate that CENH3.1 of cowpea is essential for normal plant growth and reproduction, while CENH3.2 is a gene likely to be undergoing early pseudogenization.

Cotton boll distribution and yield estimation using three-dimensional point cloud data	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Node-by-node boll mapping has been used to determine the effects of several environmental and management strategies, including irrigation rate and cultivar, on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) boll distribution. The advent of consumer 3D digital imaging may make rapid node-by-node mapping of greater acreage possible in the future. Effects of irrigation rate and cultivar on boll distribution were determined from line plots of node-specific boll distribution and boll accumulation estimate data and from vertical box and whisker plots of boll fraction using data collected by a 3D sensor system to rapidly detect open bolls before harvest over three seasons. Differences were observed between the dryland (2018 only), low irrigation, and high irrigation rates in terms of boll fraction and boll accumulation for each cultivar. The low irrigation tended to produce bolls more toward the bottom of the plant, while the high irrigation produced bolls towards the top of the plant. Yield correlation between sensor obtained and manually counted measurements was strong, with r(2) values as high as 0.87. Results obtained indicated that differences among irrigation rate and cultivar were identifiable using the sensor system during the 3 yr research study. Similar systems may allow rapid, broad-scale identification of boll distribution and yield in breeding and physiology research in the future, leading to improved identification of elite cultivars and improved management practices in cotton.																			0002-1962	1435-0645				NOV-DEC	2020	112	6					4976	4989		10.1002/agj2.20412	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.20412													WOS:000615278100035

Field assessment of microbial inoculants to control Rhizoctonia root rot on wheat	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												Rhizoctonia root rot caused by Rhizoctonia solani AG8 is a major disease in dryland cereal crops. Previous research identified a suite of microbes using in planta bioassay screening that are effective as seed-coated in-oculants for control of Rhizoctonia root rot on wheat. This paper assessed 23 strains in fields in Australia with a history of naturally occurring R. solani AG8. Due to the patchy nature of Rhizoctonia root rot in the field, a 2-phase split-plot field trial system was used to allow comparison for disease control efficacy in the same disease space. Seed applied strains were first assessed for their ability to reduce Rhizoctonia using 'microplots' which compare adjacent treated and untreated one metre rows. Up to 10% increases in plant growth and a 32% reduction in root disease was measured at eight weeks after sowing. Selected strains were then assessed in 20 m six row (3 + 3) split plots for their effects on early season wheat growth and root damage and for grain yield. A Paenibacillus and a Streptomyces strain were identified which were able to reduce root damage by 20% and 32% and increase grain yield by 4.2% and 2.8%, respectively, compared to untreated controls.

However, compared with bacteria and fungi, the impacts of increasing aridity on archaea in these ecosystems remain largely unknown. Here, soil samples were collected along a typical aridity gradient in semi-arid regions in Inner Mongolia, China, to investigate whether and how the increasing aridity affects archaeal communities. The results showed that archaeal richness linearly decreased with increasing aridity. After partialling out the effects of soil properties based on partial least squares regression, the significant aridity-richness relationship vanished. The composition of archaeal communities was distributed according to the aridity gradient. These variations were largely driven by the changes in the relative abundance of Thaumarchaeota, Euryarchaeota and unclassified phyla. Niche-based processes were predominant in structuring the observed archaeal aridity-related pattern. The structural equation models further showed that aridity indirectly reduced archaeal richness through improving soil electrical conductivity (EC) and structured community composition by changing soil total nitrogen (TN). These results suggested that soil salinization and N-losses might be important mechanisms underlying the increasing aridity-induced alterations in archaeal communities, and highlighted the importance of soil niches in mediating the indirect impacts of increasing aridity on archaea.

Despite widespread concern about the importance of biocrusts for global carbon (C) cycling, little is known about whether and how long-term grazing alters soil organic carbon (SOC) stability and stock in the biocrust layer. To assess the responses of SOC stability and stock in the biocrust layer to grazing, from June to September 2020, we carried out a large scale field survey in the restored grasslands under long-term grazing with different grazing intensities (represented by the number of goat dung per square meter) and in the grasslands strictly excluded from grazing in four regions (Dingbian County, Shenmu City, Guyuan City and Ansai District) along precipitation gradient in the hilly Loess Plateau, China. In total, 51 representative grassland sites were identified as the study sampling sites in this study, including 11 sites in Guyuan City, 16 sites in Dingbian County, 15 sites in Shenmu City and 9 sites in Ansai District. Combined with extensive laboratory analysis and statistical analysis, at each sampling site, we obtained data on biocrust attributes (cover, community structure, biomass and thickness), soil physical-chemical properties (soil porosity and soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C/N ratio)), and environmental factors (mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, altitude, plant cover, litter cover, soil particle-size distribution (the ratio of soil clay and silt content to sand content)), SOC stability index (SI) and SOC stock (SOCS) in the biocrust layer, to conduct this study. Our results revealed that grazing did not change total biocrust cover but markedly altered biocrust community structure by reducing plant cover, with a considerable increase in the relative cover of cyanobacteria (23.1%) while a decrease in the relative cover of mosses (42.2%). Soil porosity and soil C/N ratio in the biocrust layer under grazing decreased significantly by 4.1%-7.2% and 7.2%-13.3%, respectively, compared with those under grazing exclusion. The shifted biocrust community structure ultimately resulted in an average reduction of 15.5% in SOCS in the biocrust layer under grazing. However, compared with higher grazing (intensity of more than 10.00 goat dung/m(2)), light grazing (intensity of 0.00-10.00 goat dung/m(2) or approximately 1.20-2.60 goat/(hm(2)& BULL;a)) had no adverse effect on SOCS. SOC stability in the biocrust layer remained unchanged under long-term grazing due to the offset between the positive effect of the decreased soil porosity and the negative effect of the decreased soil C/N ratio on the SOC resistance to decomposition. Mean annual precipitation and soil particle-size distribution also regulated SOC stability indirectly by influencing soil porosity through plant cover and biocrust community structure. These findings suggest that proper grazing might not increase the CO2 release potential or adversely affect SOCS in the biocrust layer. This research provides some guidance for proper grazing management in the sustainable utilization of grassland resources and C sequestration in biocrusts in the hilly regions of drylands.																			1674-6767	2194-7783				AUG	2023	15	8					940	959		10.1007/s40333-023-0064-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-023-0064-x		AUG 2023											WOS:001040833700001

Drylands rainwater harvesting: a community-based management approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT AND INFORMATICS												This study's objectives were to identify issues concerning natural resource use and identify management options for natural resources from the local community's perspective. The research methodology is based on an integrated application of field interviews with individuals, focus groups, and feedback from key informants. The results showed that less than 1% of the local community supports the construction of Earth dams on rangeland reserves. Land donation and sharing by the landowners is a possible proposal for selecting potential sites for Earth dams. The lack of active participation of local communities during the planning and execution of natural resources development projects led to project failure to secure water resources in the study area. We recommend policymakers and water resources managers seriously consider active community involvement in water harvesting programs. Hence, the present top-bottom approach should be replaced by the bottom-up approach to provide sustainable assurances to water development programs.

The dynamics of soil microbial communities along succession stages has received tremendous attention. The effects of the coexistence of different grass species on the structure and function of rhizosphere soil microbial communities, however, are poorly understood, especially under drought stress conditions. Here, we investigated how different grass planting patterns and soil water content affect rhizosphere microbial community structure and function. Two typical grass species (Bothriochloa ischaemum and Stipa bungeana) on the Loess Plateau were planted in three planting systems: B. ischaemum monoculture, S. bungeana monoculture, and a mixed culture of the two species under two water regimes (optimal water: 80% field capacity [FC]; drought stress: 60% FC). Rhizosphere soil samples were collected to evaluate the rhizosphere microbial community structure (via phos-pholipid fatty acid [PLFA] biomarkers) and function (via six enzyme activities). The mixed culture of grass species noticeably shifted the rhizosphere microbial community structure. It caused the rhizosphere gram-positive:gram-negative PLFA ratio and fungal:bacterial PLFA ratio to increase under optimum water condi-tions. In comparison, drought stress caused total PLFA, bacterial PLFA, and gram-positive PLFA biomass to in-crease. Drought stress caused rhizosphere-specific enzyme activity to increase under monoculture treatment and rhizosphere-specific enzyme activity to decrease under mixed culture treatment. Soil water-soluble organic carbon, pH, and water-soluble organic phosphorus were the most important factors driving changes to rhizo-sphere microbial community composition. In comparison, pH was the predominant factor driving variation in rhizosphere specific enzyme activities. Thus, the coexistence of grass species altered the structure and function of the rhizosphere microbial community through changes in rhizosphere pH and water-soluble nutrients. In conclusion, changes to rhizodeposits under a mixed culture of grass species likely affect the structure and function of the rhizosphere microbial community. The results of the present study improve our understanding of the impacts of grass species interaction on soil biogeochemical processes under future global drought stress scenarios.

To quantify the effects of GDPs on the hydrodynamic characteristics of overland flow, indoor scouring experiments were conducted in a hydraulic flume across eight flow discharges (3-45 L min(-1)), six slope gradients (2-12 degrees), and five GDPs-a vertical strip pattern parallel to the slope direction (VP), chequerboard pattern (CP), small patches distributed in an 'X'-shape (XP), a banded pattern perpendicular to slope direction (BP), and a random pattern (RP). The results showed that GDP had a significant effect on the hydrodynamic parameters of overland flow when compared with bare slope (BS). For the five GDPs, the relative water depth, relative flow velocity, relative Froude number, and relative resistance coefficient were positively affected by flow discharge (p < 0.001), and negatively affected by slope gradient (p < 0.001); whereas the effects on the relative Reynolds number were inverted. Compared with the other patterns, the effects of BP on retarding flow was the best, as it maintained particularly remarkable characteristics affecting all five relative hydrodynamic parameters. Through parameterising GDP as a calculation factor, the prediction models of relative flow velocity (adj.R-2 = 0.788**, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency [NSE] = 0.692), and relative Froude number (adj.R-2 = 0.756*, NSE = 0.674) were established via nonlinear regression analysis. The effects of GDP on overland flow revealed here can help inform optimal GDP designs for water and soil conservation on sloped environments.

Changes in the content of above- and below-ground biomass, leaf photosynthetic rate (Pn), leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll meter reading (SPAD), diffuse non interceptance (DIFN), soil water storage (SWS), crop nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) uptake were examined in a 2-year trial of different maize-soybean intercropping systems on the Loess Plateau, China. Compared with the sole cropping system, shoot biomass of maize was increased by 54% in M2S2 and 62% in M2S4 strip intercropping treatment. The crop N and P uptake of maize increased significantly, by 54% and 50% in M2S2 and by 63% and 52% in M2S4 compared with their respective sole crop. LAI values of maize in intercropping systems were 14% and 15% for M2S2 and M2S4 less than that in the sole crop. The DIFN of intercropped maize was increased by 41% and 48% for M2S2 and M2S4 compared to monocrop. There were no significant differences in Pn and SWS in both crops between the two cropping systems. The contribution rate of DIFN in M2S2 and crop P uptake in M2S4 on the biological yield in intercropping system was the highest among all factors. We conclude that the sowing proportion affects above- and below-ground competition in maize-soybean intercropping systems.

This study aims to determine whether Al modification can enhance the phosphate adsorption capacity of Pisha sandstone and to identify the adsorption mechanism. Batch adsorption kinetic and equilibrium isotherm experiments were conducted to investigate the phosphate adsorption behavior of Al-PS (Pisha sandstone modified with Al). The results showed that PS could be successfully modified with Al. As the Al modification ratio increased, the P adsorption capacities of Al-PS increased and the optimal Al-to-PS ratio was 0.81:1. Considering the modification cost and P removal efficiency, it was decided to apply 0.27:1 the Al-to-PS mass ratio in batch adsorption experiments and characterization. The phosphate adsorption capacity decreased but the removal rate increased with increasing amount of Al-PS. The temperature had no significant effect on the adsorption, and the adsorption kinetic and isothermal adsorption data could be well fitted by the pseudo-second-order and Temkin models, respectively. The phosphate adsorption mechanism of Al-PS for phosphate was proposed to be electrostatic adsorption. This study suggested that Al-PS could be considered to be an effective material for phosphate adsorption, and it could enhance the soil phosphorus content when added into sandy soil.																			0959-6526	1879-1786				JUL 25	2021	308								127255	10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.127255	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.127255		MAY 2021											WOS:000663747700001

Pers. were evaluated for key factors involved in its widespread distribution in different environmental conditions. Ecotypes collected from salt marshes showed better vegetative growth, accumulation of inorganic ions (Na+, K+ and Ca2+), compatible solutes (proline and glycine betaine) and higher activities of antioxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase) than all other ecotypes. Increased root and stem radii, sclerification intensity, aerenchyma formation, storage parenchyma (pith and cortex), vascular bundle area and metaxylem area were also observed in the same ecotypes. Notable leaf modifications included development of thicker leaves with intensive sclerification around vascular bundles and wide metaxylem vessels. Ecotypes collected from saline dryland featured large leaf area, increased level of glycine betaine, intensive sclerification and wide leaf xylem vessels. Ecotypes from deserts/semi-deserts exhibited higher soluble proteins and carotenoids, thick epidermis of stem and leaf blade, large cortex and broad metaxylem vessels in root, thick leaf sheaths, well-developed bulliform cells and stomata more oriented towards abaxial surface. Ecotypes collected from river or canal bank possessed high chlorophyll content (chl a, chl b and total chl), epidermal and storage parenchyma cell size, endodermal thickness in root, metaxylem area in stem, sclerification in leaf sheath and increased stomatal density on adaxial leaf surface. In conclusion, ecotypes collected from different habitats exhibited explicit variation in structures (internal modifications) and functions (physiology) due to environmental variability that may contribute to the wide distribution of C. dactylon.

This study investigated the influences of adding fly ash and Montmorillonite-enriched sandstone (MS) on the physical properties and multifractal characteristics of pore structures in a sandy soil. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to obtain the pore structures. MATLAB scripts were developed for calculating the Holder index (alpha(q)) and generalized dimensions (D-q) of binary SEM images. The results showed that particle compositions and water retention capacity are improved after adding the two materials. The amplitudes of D-q (Delta D) was reduced by 6.9% to 35.6% in the amended soils, which means smaller scaling diversities of pore structures. The right branches of multifractal spectrum (alpha(r)) showed higher amplitudes than that of left branches (alpha(l)), indicating that smallest pores were more diverse than the largest pores after adding the two materials. Multifractal parameters showed significant linear relationships with the sand and silt content, bulk density and total porosity. The result indicate that multifractal parameters could be used to describe the changes of pore characteristics and to quantify the characteristics of pore structures in the amended sandy soils.																			0365-0340	1476-3567				JUL 28	2020	66	9					1188	1202		10.1080/03650340.2019.1660960	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2019.1660960		AUG 2019											WOS:000484401800001

FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Chickpea is an important source of plant-based protein and mineral elements such as iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn). The development of superior high-yielding germplasm with high nutritional value becomes central for any breeding program. Chickpea biofortified and nutrient-dense seeds can contribute to mitigate many human health problems associated with protein and micronutrients deficiency. In this study, 282 advanced chickpea lines were grown under field conditions to evaluate their agronomic performances and nutritional quality value. The trial was conducted under winter planting conditions during the cropping season 2017/2018 at ICARDA-Marchouch research station, Morocco. Results revealed high genetic variation and significant differences between the tested genotypes for all studied parameters. Under field conditions, the grain yield (GY) varied from 0.57 to 1.81 (t.ha(-1)), and 100-seed weight (HSW) ranged from 23.1 to 50.9 g. Out of the 282 genotypes, only 4 genotypes (i.e., S130109, S130058, S130066, and S130157) combined both good agronomic performances (GY, HSW) and high nutritional quality (protein, macronutrients, and micronutrients). Protein content ranged from 18.9 to 32.4%. For the whole collection, Fe content varied from 31.2 to 81 ppm, while Zn content ranged from 32.1 to 86.1 ppm. Correlation analysis indicated that the studied traits were significantly intercorrelated, with negative correlation between protein content and Zn concentration. Positive correlations were observed between grain filling time (F2M) and the micronutrients Zn, Cu, and Mn and macroelements K and Mg. Low positive correlation was also recorded between Pr and Fe concentrations. No significant correlation was observed between Fe and Zn. Positive correlations observed between main agronomic and nutritional quality traits makes easy any simultaneous enhancement when combining these traits.

Most studies focused on its effects on soil and plant properties, but few works investigated biodiversity, especially soil fauna. Methods We investigated soil fauna in areas where R. pseudoacacia was planted 10, 20, 30, and 50 years ago and grassland areas in LP. Results Results showed that afforestation can significantly increase the soil fauna groups of the litter layer which does not further increase with forest age. However, the number of soil fauna groups, especially the dominant groups (mites and springtails), was not significantly affected by afforestation. After afforestation, soil fauna abundance first increased and then decreased, with a maximum value observed 20 years post-planting. The average abundance of soil fauna in the soil layer of the R. pseudoacacia was 22, 292 individuals m(-2), which was 4.91 times more than in the litter layer. However, the number of soil fauna groups in the soil layer (10) was significantly lower than that in the litter layer (17). Litter thickness and soil total nitrogen contributed the most and explained 34.7% and 29.5% of soil fauna communities in the litter and soil layers, respectively. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the change of soil fauna community in the litter layer by afforestation was greater than that in soil layer. However, the effect of forest age on soil fauna was only weak. Afforestation-induced changes in soil and vegetation properties (e.g. stand density, litter thickness, and soil total nitrogen) were crucial determinants of the changes in soil fauna community.																			0032-079X	1573-5036				2022 DEC 23	2022										10.1007/s11104-022-05844-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-022-05844-0		DEC 2022											WOS:000903193100001

Understanding the distribution of soil physical and hydraulic properties of the soil profile under various land uses would help reveal the mechanism behind the degradation of black soil. In this study, we investigated the variation in soil physical and hydraulic properties with land uses and soil depths in the black soil area of Northeast China. Disturbed samples and undisturbed soil cores were collected from 0-100 cm soil depths under agricultural land (AL), forestland (FL), and shrub land (SL). Our results showed that the land use and soil depth significantly affected the soil bulk density (BD), field capacity (FC), capillary moisture capacity (CMC), saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), and soil water retention curve (theta(s) and alpha). Small macroaggregates accounted for most of the soil mass and were significantly higher in FL but lower in AL for the 0-50 cm of the soil samples. The FC, CMC, and Ks decreased, but the BD increased with the soil depth across the three land-use types. In addition, the soil in AL had a higher BD but lower CMC and Ks than the soil in FL and SL for most soil depths. These results indicated that land use can influence the variation in soil physical and hydraulic properties within the 0-100 cm soil depth, and agricultural use is a major reason for soil degradation in this black soil region.

J	Zhen, Q; Zheng, JY; Zhang, XC; Shao, MA				Zhen, Qing; Zheng, Jiyong; Zhang, Xingchang; Shao, Ming'an			Changes of solute transport characteristics in soil profile after mining at an opencast coal mine site on the Loess Plateau, China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Dramatic changes in soil during opencast coalmine activities inevitably change soil water and solute movement. The objectives of this study were to assess the effects of mining on solute transport in different soil profiles and to find the relationships between solute transport parameters and soil physicochemical characteristics. After taking undisturbed soil columns from the different soil profiles of natural land (NLs) and reclaimed mine land (RLs), ammonium nitrate displacement studies were conducted, and the breakthrough curves (BTCs) of NO3- and NH4+ were obtained. Due to mining and reconstruction, soil texture became coarser, bulk density increased 2.77-15.15%, cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil organic matter (SOM), and total nitrogen (TN) content decreased 19.54-37.25%, 53.66-72.05%, and 42.58-58.55%, respectively. Additionally, the distributions of the physicochemical properties changed. The BTCs of NO3- for all soil columns can be well explained by both the convection-dispersion equation (CDE) and the two-region model (T-R). The transport parameters average pore water velocity (nu), dispersion coefficient (D), and dispersivity (lambda) were lower in RLs, which indicates that solutes became difficult to penetrate after mining. A significantly correlated relationship of bulk density and soil texture with the nu, D, and lambda parameters only occurred in the RLs samples. This result indicates that transport processes in NLs columns became more complicated and that soil texture and bulk density played an important role in the transport process of RLs columns. The two-sitemodel couldwell describe NH4+ transport for both NLs and RLs and provided a slightly better fit in RLs. This finding also gave evidence that RLs became homogeneous after mining and reconstruction. The parameter retardation factor (R) was significantly correlated to CEC, bulk density and soil texture in RLs. These results suggest that soil becomes homogeneous after mining and reconstruction and that high bulk density and fine soil texture could decrease the risk of leaching of solutes.

In this paper, runoff scouring experiments were conducted with five varying inflow rates (8.5, 10, 11.5, 13, 14.5 L min(-1) m(-1)) and one slope (8 degrees) using two typical red soils in subtropical China: Ultisols derived from shale (UDS) and Ultisols derived from quaternary red clay (UDQ). The results showed that for the two red soils, runoff rate, sediment yield rate, and rill erosion amount were all positively correlated with inflow rates in linear relationships (p < 0.05). The high sand and low clay contents in eroded sediments were closely related to the original soil texture (dominated by clay and silt) and rill flow energy. Stream power and unit stream power were the optimal hydraulic parameters to characterize rill erosion mechanisms for UDS and UDQ, respectively. For UDQ with higher clay content and bulk density, the sediment yield process was more stable and the sand content in the eroded sediments was significantly higher than that of UDS, while the silt content was significantly lower. The rill flow of UDQ had slower velocity and larger Darcy-Weisbach resistance coefficient than that of UDS. For UDS with lower clay and higher sand content, the average sediment yield rate and rill depth were 2.26-4.71 and 2.79-6.53 times of UDQ, respectively, and the rill erodibility parameter was 1.84 times that of UDQ. The results are helpful for understanding the rill erosion mechanism and preventing soil loss in subtropical areas.					chen, lin/HNS-4734-2023; Hao, Fang/GRJ-3165-2022; Wu, Huaqing/AAQ-1022-2021; Yang, Tiantian/P-5989-2016	chen, lin/0000-0003-2029-2074; Wu, Huaqing/0000-0002-3867-3740; Yang, Tiantian/0000-0002-0148-396X; Gong, Yuwei/0000-0001-9460-1533													0341-8162	1872-6887				JUN	2022	213								106139	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106139	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106139		FEB 2022											WOS:000790437600003

Therefore, we conducted a 3-yr field study to evaluate the potential role of controlled-release urea in improving productivity and resource use efficiency of maize in semiarid areas in China. Treatments were established as two mulching modes (plastic film mulching [FM] and no mulching [NM]) and three nitrogen application modes (no nitrogen fertilizer [CK], a 1:2 ratio of controlled-release urea to common urea [CRU], and common urea only [U]). Higher temperature and soil water content under FM treatments significantly accelerated maize growth and development, as indicated in terms of a larger leaf area index before silking, greater biomass accumulation, and greater grain yield. More robust plants with controlled-release urea under mulching can better absorb and utilize deep soil water to increase water use efficiency (WUE). Mean shoot biomass, grain yield, and WUE during the three experimental years were 35.3, 19.0, and 12.4% higher in mulching with CRU treatments than in NM with controlled-release urea treatments, respectively. Significant interactions existed for yield and WUE among surface mulching (SM), nitrogen fertilizer (NF), and sampling year (Y) in the three experimental years, except for SM x NF for WUE. These results demonstrate that a mixture of controlled-release urea and U at an appropriate ratio under SM can provide a better water/temperature/nitrogen conditions for maize growth to realize relatively high yield with labor and time savings in semiarid farmland.					sun, hao/HMD-2991-2023; Yue, Shanchao/D-1846-2009; sun, hao/GRS-7732-2022	Yue, Shanchao/0000-0001-8724-2974; 													0002-1962	1435-0645				NOV-DEC	2019	111	6					3194	3206		10.2134/agronj2019.03.0215	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2019.03.0215													WOS:000505571400057
J	Liu, L; Li, ZW; Jiao, PP				Liu, Lin; Li, Zhongwu; Jiao, Panpan			Hydraulic mechanisms of the uneven enrichment of soil organic carbon in sediments during rain-induced overland flow	PLOS ONE												Organic carbon (OC) can be unevenly enriched in different-sized sediment particles under low-intensity, rain-induced overland flows, but its hydraulic mechanisms are not completely understood. Hence, in this study, the hydraulic transport mechanisms of unevenly enriched OC between different-sized sediment particles were investigated through simulated rainfall experiments at gradients of 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 15 degrees and typical regional rainfall intensities of 45, 90, and 120 mm h(-1). Results showed that the critical flow velocity of aggregate transport through loess soil was approximately 0.08 m s(-1). When the flow velocity was larger than this critical value, the aggregate loss amount increased quickly and exponentially. Flow velocities lower than 0.08 m s(-1) were determined to be essential conditions for uneven OC enrichment between sediment particles. At such velocities, even when the runoff depth was greater than 0.0018 m, the enrichment ratio of soil organic carbon (SOC; ERoc) values in all size classes of sediment particles was larger than 1.0. Small runoff depths caused preferential OC enrichment in silt and clay, whereas large runoff depths promoted OC enrichment in the >0.25 mm size class of sediment particles. The critical flow velocity and transport way differ between these high-OC-concentration clay and silt and large light organic particles. The interaction between flow velocity and runoff depth on ERocs in <0.05 mm particles was larger than that of >0.05 mm particles. Under the transport limit erosion, the flow velocity and stream power positively correlated with uneven ERoc in different size sediment particles through distinct laws. Slope and rainfall intensity could not be ignored in predicting uneven OC enrichment in sediments by interacting with hydraulic factor and effecting aggregate stripping, respectively. Hydraulic factors mainly affected the uneven OC enrichment by controlling particle selective detachment and transport process. Owing to the different hydraulic mechanisms of OC enrichment in different size particles, the obtained regression functions for uneven OC enrichment could be divided into two types. One was for calculating the OC concentrations in sediment particles with sizes of <2 mm (R-2 > 0.844, P< 0.005), and the other was for calculating the OC concentrations in large macroaggregates (>2 mm; R-2 = 0.805, P< 0.005). The findings provide an important reference for understanding SOC transport mechanisms and its mineralization potential under the effect of water erosion and improving SOC dynamic models.																			1932-6203					FEB 22	2022	17	2							e0262865	10.1371/journal.pone.0262865	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262865								35192628					WOS:000812552500013

Multi-Parent Advanced Generation Inter Cross (MAGIC) groundnut population was developed in a convergent crossing scheme using eight founder parents to develop a mapping population for multiple traits includes LLS. The experiments conducted in light chamber using detached leaf assay, and disease field screening nurseries at two locations (ICRISAT and ARS, Kasbe Digraj) showed significant variability for LLS resistance and component of resistance traits. Total 10 MAGIC lines with longer incubation (> 11.0 days) and two MAGIC lines with longer latent period (> 27 days) than the resistant parent, GPBD 4 were identified. The MAGIC lines, ICGR 171413, and ICGR 171443 with a lesion diameter of < 1 mm and 4.10-5.67% of leaf area damage can be valuable sources for the alleles limiting the pathogen severity. A total of 20 MAGIC lines recorded significantly superior for disease score at 105 DAP_I (5.60-6.89) compared to resistant check, GPDB 4 (6.89). Further studies to determine the type and number of genes controlling the LLS component traits in groundnut will be useful for improvement of resistance to LLS. Genomic selection approach can be valuable in groundnut breeding to harness the minor alleles contributing to the component traits of LLS resistance.

Despite the crucial ecological role of bacteria, our understanding of their large-scale biogeography patterns across longitude (east-west transect), and the processes that determine these patterns lags significantly behind that of macro-organisms. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to evaluate the geographic distributions of bacterial diversity and their driving factors across different longitude sites along an 800-km east-west transect in the Loess Plateau. Twenty-four phyla were detected across all soil samples and the most sequence-abundant bacterial phyla were Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Chloroflexi and Gemmatimonadetes (average relative abundance >5%). Soil bacterial a-diversity, expressed by the richness of soil bacterial communities and Shannon diversity, differed among climates (MAP) but showed strong correlations with MAP (r = -0.537 and r = -0.42, respectively: p < 0.05 in both bacterial diversity indices). Variation partition analysis demonstrated that the bacterial community structure was closely correlated with environmental variables and geographic distance, which together explained 62% of the community variation. Soil properties contributed more to bacterial community variation than the combined geographic distance (historical contingencies) and climate factors. Among all environmental factors, soil pH exhibited a dominant role in structuring bacterial communities in this arid area. Our findings provide new evidence of bacterial biogeography patterns in an arid area (MAP ranged from 473 mm to 547 mm). Additionally, the results indicated a close linkage among soil bacterial community, climate and edaphic variables, which is critical for predicting promoting sustainable ecosystem services in the Loess Plateau.

Why Plants Harbor Complex Endophytic Fungal Communities: Insights From Perennial Bunchgrass <i>Stipagrostis sabulicola</i> in the Namib Sand Sea	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												All perennial plants harbor diverse endophytic fungal communities, but why they tolerate these complex asymptomatic symbioses is unknown. Using a multi-pronged approach, we conclusively found that a dryland grass supports endophyte communities comprised predominantly of latent saprophytes that can enhance localized nutrient recycling after senescence. A perennial bunchgrass, Stipagrostis sabulicola, which persists along a gradient of extreme abiotic stress in the hyper-arid Namib Sand Sea, was the focal point of our study. Living tillers yielded 20 fungal endophyte taxa, 80% of which decomposed host litter during a 28-day laboratory decomposition assay. During a 6-month field experiment, tillers with endophytes decomposed twice as fast as sterilized tillers, consistent with the laboratory assay. Furthermore, profiling the community active during decomposition using next-generation sequencing revealed that 59-70% of the S. sabulicola endophyte community is comprised of latent saprophytes, and these dual-niche fungi still constitute a large proportion (58-62%) of the litter community more than a year after senescence. This study provides multiple lines of evidence that the fungal communities that initiate decomposition of standing litter develop in living plants, thus providing a plausible explanation for why plants harbor complex endophyte communities. Using frequent overnight non-rainfall moisture events (fog, dew, high humidity), these latent saprophytes can initiate decomposition of standing litter immediately after tiller senescence, thus maximizing the likelihood that plant-bound nutrients are recycled in situ and contribute to the nutrient island effect that is prevalent in drylands.

Darrel			Large nitrogen oxide emission pulses from desert soils and associated microbiomes	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Nitrogen (N) trace gas emission pulses produced after wetting dry soils may be important pathways of ecosystem N loss. However, the rates and mechanisms controlling these emissions remain unclear. We tested whether changes in microbial community structure and increased rates of atmospheric N deposition could explain N emissions at two desert sites differing in atmospheric N deposition by similar to six fold. We measured peak NOx (sum of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) emissions 12 h post-wetting. NOx emissions remained elevated over 24 h and increased after adding N. In contrast, we measured the highest nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions within only 15 min post-wetting. N2O emissions decreased within 12 h, were insensitive to adding N, and were among the highest reported globally. Microbial communities at the high N deposition site were less diverse with higher 16S nitrifier and bacterial amoA gene abundances relative to the low N deposition site, suggesting an increased capacity for nitrification. Nevertheless, N emissions were lower at the high N deposition site. While microbial communities changed after wetting, these changes were not correlated with N emissions. We conclude that desert soils can produce substantial NOx and N2O emission pulses, but that these emissions do not appear directly governed by changing microbial community characteristics or higher atmospheric N inputs. These findings highlight the importance of gaseous N loss pathways from dryland ecosystems that may contribute to sustained N limitation, with implications for atmospheric chemistry and Earth's climate.

Darrel			Soil NH3 emissions across an aridity, soil pH, and N deposition gradient in southern California	ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE												Soil ammonia (NH3) emissions are seldom included in ecosystem nutrient budgets; however, they may represent substantial pathways for ecosystem nitrogen (N) loss, especially in arid regions where hydrologic N losses are comparatively small. To characterize how multiple factors affect soil NH3 emissions, we measured NH3 losses from 6 dryland sites along a gradient in soil pH, atmospheric N deposition, and rainfall. We also enriched soils with ammonium (NH4+), to determine whether N availability would limit emissions, and measured NH3 emissions with passive samplers in soil chambers following experimental wetting. Because the volatilization of NH3 is sensitive to pH, we hypothesized that NH3 emissions would be higher in more alkaline soils and that they would increase with increasing NH4+ availability. Consistent with this hypothesis, average soil NH3 emissions were positively correlated with average site pH (R2 = 0.88, P = 0.004), ranging between 0.77 & PLUSMN; at the least arid and most acidic site and 24.2 & PLUSMN; 16.0 mg N-NH3 m-2 h-1 and alkaline site. Wetting soils while simultaneously adding NH4+ increased NH3 emissions from alkaline and moderately acidic soils (F1,35 = 14.7, P < 0.001), suggesting that high N availability can stimulate NH3 emissions even when pH is less than optimal for NH3 volatilization. Thus, both pH and N availability act as proximate controls over NH3 emissions suggesting that these N losses may limit how much N accumulates in arid ecosystems.

Here, we examined the spatial distribution patterns and calculated differences in diversity and function for abundant and rare bacterial sub-communities across 114 typical dryland farmland (corn, soybean and alfalfa) soils in crop monoculture (CM) and rotation (CR) systems in northeastern China. Significant (P < 0.001) distance-decay relationships were detected for the abundant and rare sub-communities in both CM and CR systems. In addition, edaphic variables (CMabundant = 27.3%, CMrare = 9.1%; CRabundant = 33.3%, CRrare = 15.3%) largely contributed to the variation of sub-communities based on variance partitioning analysis (VPA). Shannon and Chao1 indices were significantly (P < 0.05) different between abundant and rare sub-communities in CM and CR systems. Both abundant (RANOSIM = 0.065, P = 0.004) and rare (RANOSIM = 0.054, P = 0.013) bacterial community were significantly (P < 0.05) separated according to CM and CR systems. Based on Tax4Fun, for Proteobacteria, environmental information processing was the main potential function in CM, while metabolism was the one in CR system. Additionally, the potential functions of rare taxa were greater than that of abundant taxa both in CM and CR systems. Our results would not only provide theoretical support for better understanding the roles of rare and abundant bacteria, but also offered new opportunity to improve agricultural ecosystem functions.

Based on the long-term and high-resolution daily precipitation obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center (CPC), the total summer precipitation (TSP), precipitation extreme and persistent precipitation extreme (PPE) characteristics are revealed in Central Asia (CA) (34.3 degrees N-55.4 degrees N and 46.5 degrees E-96.4 degrees E) during 1979-2018. Results show that TSP, precipitation extreme and PPE in CA are significantly increased and the abrupt increasing occurred mainly in 1998. Additionally, proportion of precipitation extreme in TSP also increases. More significant positive trends of TSP, precipitation extreme and PPE occur in zones of northern Kazakhstan (NKZ) and Tienshan mountain range (TSM). Notably, although PEP in other regions exhibit indistinctive changes, PPE in some particular years abnormally frequent which may leads disasters. Further analyses indicate TSP and precipitation extreme in CA have significant positive correlation with the increasing water vapor transport from the southern boundary. Meanwhile, increasing horizontal moisture advection and enhanced vertical moisture advection, contributes to increasing in TSP and precipitation extreme in NKZ and TSM. In addition, negative phase of East Atlantic/West Russia (EA/WR) may result in the cyclone anomalous and deepened trough over CA, which cooperates with enhanced vertical advection and abnormal south moisture, finally provides favorable conditions for precipitation and precipitation extreme.

Registration of 'Mela CL plus ' soft white winter wheat	JOURNAL OF PLANT REGISTRATIONS												'Mela CL+' (Reg. no. CV-1157, PI 675008; PVP 201500291) is a soft white common winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar carrying two-gene tolerance to imazamox herbicide, also known as Clearfield Plus, that was developed and released by the Agricultural Research Center, Washington State University, in October 2013. It was tested under the experimental designations EBC2F3-3-20 and WA008155. Mela CL+ was developed using a marker-assisted backcross selection method involving a cross between the soft white winter (SWW) wheat cultivar Than' and CL0618, an Australian hard red spring line carrying the two-gene Clearfield technology. The two-gene Clearfield technology present in Mela CL+ was due to two mutation alleles Als1 and Als2 of the acetolactate synthase (ALS) gene copies located on the long arm of chromosomes 6B and 6D. Mela CL+ has high grain yield potential and intermediate plant height and is well adapted to the dryland production areas of the Pacific Northwest (PNW) with <300 mm of annual precipitation. Tested in multiple locations and years, Mela CL+ showed herbicide tolerance equivalent to Clearfield Plus check cultivar AP503 CL2' and greater tolerance than single-gene Clearfield cultivars grown in the PNW. Mela CL+ has end-use quality characteristics similar to cultivars 'ORCF-102', 'Stephens', and Aerpha'. As compared to Eltan, Mela CL+ has better stripe rust resistance, whereas the level of snow mold and Cephalosporium stripe tolerance is equal.

However, little is known about the development processes and mechanisms of gullies on spoil dumps. A flow scouring experiment was conducted on an established platform-slope system under 3.6-5.04 m(3) h(-1). The soils of the system consisted of a surface sandy loam A layer and anunderlying clay loam B layer. The results showed that the platform exhibited a gully development process of headcut-incision-headcut-expansion-stabilization and the steep slope experienced gully development of A-layer incision-A-layer expansion-B-layer incision-stabilization. The results showed 88.97-100% of Froude Number (Fr) decrement and 47.90-88.97% of Darcy-Weisbach roughness coefficient increment finished in the two incision stages on the steep slope. Gully depth has the most sensitive response to flow hydraulics. A significant linear correlation exists between gully depth and shear stress, runoff power, Fr, and Reynolds Number (R-2 > 0.337). Overall, the optimal hydraulic indicator varies within different stages for describing the gully morphology development, illustrating the different action mechanism between flow hydraulics and gully morphology. Our findings provide a theoretical support for future mechanistic studies of gully erosion and the land management on spoil dump.

M.			Integrating different stability models to investigate genotypexenvironment interactions and identify stable and high-yielding barley genotypes	EUPHYTICA												Barley is the fourth largest grain crop globally with varieties suited to temperate, subarctic, and subtropical areas. The identification and subsequent selection of superior varieties are complicated by genotype-by-environment interactions. The main objective of this study was to use parametric and non-parametric stability measures along with a GGE biplot model to identify high-yielding stable barley genotypes in Iran. Eighteen barley genotypes (16 new genotypes and two control varieties) were evaluated in a randomized complete block design with four replications at five locations over three growing seasons (2013-2014, 2014-2015, 2015-2016). The combined analysis of variance indicated that the environment main effect accounted for>69% of all variation, compared with<31% for the combined genotype (G) and genotype-by-environment interaction effects. The mean grain yield of each genotype across the five test sites and three seasons ranged from 1900 to 2302kgha(-1). Using Spearman's rank correlation and principal component analyses, the stability measures were divided into three groups: the first included mean yield, TOP and b, which are related to the dynamic concept of stability, the second comprised (i), W CVi, Sdi2, KR, and the non-parametric measures, S-(i) and NP(i), which are related to the static concept of stability, and the third included (i) and R-2. The GGE biplot analysis indicated that, of the five test locations, Gonbad and Moghan had the most discriminating and representative environments. Hence, these locations are recommended as ideal test locations in Iran for the selection of superior genotypes. The numerical and graphical methods both produced similar results, identifying genotypes G12, G13, and G17 as the best material for rainfed conditions in Iran; these genotypes should be promoted for commercial production.

However, little is known about the role of plant functional groups in community recruitment. A chronosequence of grazing-excluded grasslands was selected to analyze the aboveground community composition and offspring recruitment based on plant functional groups. Grazing exclusion significantly increased grasses biomass (111.7-480.7%), height (95.6-241.8%), and coverage (84.8-148.5%) and decreased grasses density (10.2-59.7%). Grazing exclusion eroded total species richness (13.2-25.0%) and forbs richness (16.6-39.4%). Grazing exclusion shifted the dominance from forbs to grasses. Grasses functional group (GFG) determined community structure, but forbs functional group (FFG) regulated species diversity in typical steppe. Clonal recruitment played a decisive role in the community regeneration, especially tiller recruit mode by GFG. Grazing exclusion had different effects on offspring recruitment of grasses and FFG. Total asexual, grasses asexual, and tiller offspring density both first significantly increased and then significantly decreased with grazing exclusion time. Forbs asexual offspring density did not significantly decrease in 10- and 20-year grazing exclusion grasslands but significantly reduced after 30 years. Change in community dominance caused by grazing or grazing exclusion did not alter the tiller recruitment dominance in this area. Our results indicate that grazing exclusion presents a negative effect on community regeneration and biodiversity conservation in the studied typical steppe.

Multi-stakeholder participation for successful implementation of applied research projects in Africa	ECOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS AND EVIDENCE												Rainwater harvesting from Roads For Indigenous Pasture production and improved rural livelihoods in Kitui, Kenya (ROFIP) is an applied research project. It assessed the potential of combining multiple sustainable land management practices, for example native grass reseeding, rainwater harvesting from roads and in situ microcatchments to enhance vegetation cover in a semi-arid dryland in Kenya. Rural earth roads were used as a catchment. Runoff generated from rainfall events was diverted into reseeded pastures with trenches established at intervals, across a slope. The ROFIP project also integrated microcatchments created using ox-driven ploughs, a traditional practice for seedbed preparation and harnessing in situ rainwater harvesting in African drylands. Combining the diversion of runoff from roads and harvesting rainwater in situ improves and prolongs soil moisture availability in reseeded pastures. Consequently, this translated to higher biomass yields (i.e. forage for livestock) and vegetation cover (land degradation mitigation and enhanced soil health). This project clearly showed that combining rainwater harvesting and native pasture reseeding improves water retention and soil health, thus improving sustainable pasture production. However, for this to be achieved, it is prudent to involve practitioners to co-design practical solutions that are socially, economically and environmentally sustainable. Multi-stakeholder engagement, effective knowledge sharing, and community involvement can be major enablers in the pursuit of environmental and socioeconomic relevant benefits in applied research projects in Africa. This approach enhances a sense of shared purpose among practitioners and empowers them to become points of reference to their peers.

Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is an insect native to the tropical and subtropical Americas that has recently spread to Africa, where it predominately attacks maize, sorghum and other plant species. Biological control is an environmentally friendly way of combatting the pest and contributes to an integrated pest management approach. In Africa, several trichogrammatid parasitoids andTelenomus remusNixon (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae) have been found parasitizing eggs of the FAW. In Niger, the egg parasitoids encountered includeTrichogrammatoideasp. (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) andTelenomus remusNixon. Parasitism of the FAW eggs by the two egg parasitoids was assessed in the laboratory, followed by field testing on sentinel eggs. In the laboratory,T. remusparasitized on average 78% of FAW eggs, compared to 25% forTrichogrammatoideasp.Telenomus remuswas able to parasitize egg masses that were fully covered with scales, whileTrichogrammatoideasp. parasitized only uncovered egg masses. On-farm releases ofT. remusin sorghum fields caused up to 64% of FAW egg parasitism. Parasitized eggs yielded viable progeny, which can contribute to FAW egg parasitism build-up during the cropping season. Our findings lay the groundwork for the use ofT. remusin augmentative releases against FAW in Africa.

In this study, the residue behavior of fenpyroximate on eggplant, orange, and guava was investigated. The chronic and acute dietary intake was calculated at several sampling points, and preharvest intervals (PHI) were proposed to ensure compliance with the existing maximum residue levels. A simple extraction protocol combined with ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was employed to quantify residue levels. The method was successfully validated according to the European Union (EU) guidelines, and a limit of quantification of 0.01 mg/kg was set. The dissipation patterns in all crops could be described by the first-order kinetics model with half-lives of 1.7, 2.2, and 1.9 days for eggplants, guavas, and oranges, respectively. The dietary risk assessment at the authorized or more critical application patterns was acceptable for the consumers. For oranges and eggplant, a PHI of 3 and 7 days, respectively, can be proposed; however, a proposal was not possible for guava due to the absence of maximum residue limits (MRLs) and quantitative residue findings at all sampling points tested. The current work not only contributes to the practical application of fenpyroximate related to residue management in dryland areas, such as Egypt, but can also be used to estimate the appropriate PHIs and support the authorization of plant protection products as supplementary information.

This paper presents an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate the farmer behavior under changing physical and institutional environments in a case study of Miyun Reservoir watershed, China. The ABM model simulates the complex adaptive systems of agricultural water users under an agricultural water-saving compensation policy. The model we developed in this study characterizes agents' sensitivity, learning capability, and information radius, which impacts agricultural income and water consumption of a household. By applying this model to a local 'paddy to dryland' subsidy policy program aiming at reshaping the agricultural water-saving behavior, the results show that this policy program reduces agricultural water consumption while also reducing household agricultural income. The policy depends on administrative intervention and financial subsidies at first to ensure compliance and gradually shape household behavior in the long run. And we also propose a suitable subsidy range of 250-350 yuan for this policy program in the long run. The model we built can help to understand agricultural water use adaptation to both anthropogenic and environmental interventions. This research also contributes to the coupled natural and human systems study with the bottom-up agent-based model, and the empirical case study provides solid policy implications for the agricultural water use allocation and adaptative management at the watershed scale.

As meteorological data series collection is difficult in arid and semiarid areas, satellite products have recently become an alternative for water resources studies. A daily groundwater recharge estimation in the NW part of the Lake Chad Basin, using a soil-plant-atmosphere model (VisualBALAN), from ground- and satellite-based meteorological input dataset for non-irrigated and irrigated land and for the 2005-2014 period is presented. Average annual values were 284 mm and 30 degrees C for precipitation and temperature in ground-based gauge stations. For the satellite-model-based Lake Chad Basin Flood and Drought Monitor System platform (CHADFDM), average annual precipitation and temperature were 417 mm and 29 degrees C, respectively. Uncertainties derived from satellite data measurement could account for the rainfall difference. The estimated mean annual aquifer recharge was always higher from satellite- than ground-based data, with differences up to 46% for dryland and 23% in irrigated areas. Recharge response to rainfall events was very variable and results were very sensitive to: wilting point, field capacity and curve number for runoff estimation. Obtained results provide plausible recharge values beyond the uncertainty related to data input and modelling approach. This work prevents on the important deviations in recharge estimation from weighted-ensemble satellite-based data, informing in decision making to both stakeholders and policy makers.

To evaluate the effects of different shrub species on soil N availability, transformation, and their seasonal dynamics, we determined mineral N contents and mineralization rates in soils under three common shrub species (Artemisia ordosica Krasch., Caragana korshinskii Kom., and Salix psanunophila C.) and in bare land during the growing season in the desert-loess transition zone in northwestern China. The average contents of soil nitrate N and mineral N were 153% and 55% greater, respectively, and cumulative net N nitrification and mineralization were 101.2 and 121.0 mg Nm(-2) higher, respectively, in soils beneath C. korshinskii than in bare land (P < 0.05) at the 0-10 cm depth over the growing season. The net N mineralization rate in 0-10 cm depth was significantly higher in soils under C. korshinskii than that in bare land during 21 Jun-23 Jul and 23 Aug-15 Oct of the growing season. However, C. korshinskii did not influence soil N metrics at the 10-20 cm depth. The incorporation of A. ordosica and S. psanunophila into bare land did not influence soil N availability or transformation rates. Our results demonstrated that C. korshinskii was more preferable than A. ordosica and S. psanunophila in ameliorating soil N cycling in the desert-loess transition zone.

The samples were extracted with acetone and methanol (acetone : methanol 7 : 3, v / v, 0.1 % BHT w / v), and fully dissolved in methanol / acetonitrile / n-hexane (7 : 2 : 1, v / v / v) mixed solution. Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column (4.6 mmx150 mm, 4 mu m) was used as the separation column, acetonitrile,methanol and n-hexane solution were used as mobile phase with gradient elution, flow rate was 1.0 mL.min(-1), column temperature was 25 degrees C, injection volume was 50 mu L, and detection wave length was 450 nm. The mass concentration of lutein had a good linear relationships with the chromatographic peak area in the range of 0.5-5.0 mu g.mL(-1), the correlation coefficients were all not less than 0.999 8, and the detection limits was 12 ng.mL(-1). The recoveries rate of standard addition in sampling were 95.50%-97.33%, and the relative standard deviations of determination results were 1.20%-1.66%(n=5). The method is sensitive, precise, rapid, accurate and efficient. The advantages of this study can be summarized in the next bullet points: Can be used for the determination of lutein in wheat.

This study tests the relationships between food insecurity, farm forests, and biomass poverty using a longitudinal dataset from the Amhara region of Ethiopia. These data form part of the Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey, which collected panel data over three survey rounds from 530 households between 2011 and 2016. This dataset represents a collection of unique socioeconomic, wellbeing, and micro-land use measures, including farm forests. Hierarchical mixed effect regression models assessed the relationship between food insecurity and farm forests as well as the conditional effects of biomass poverty among the poorest farmers and women-headed households. Over a six-year study period, farmers reported increased stress from smaller land holdings, higher prices, and climate-related shocks. A clear trend towards spontaneous dispersed afforestation is observed by both researchers and satellite remote sensing. Model results indicate, dedicating approximately 10% of farm area to forest reduces months of food insecurity by half. The greatest reductions in food insecurity from farm forests are reported by ultra-poor and crop residue-burning households, suggesting that biomass poverty may be a major constraint to resilient food security on these farms. This research provides novel quantitative evidence of induced intensification and food security impacts of farm management preserving and building stores of biomass value as green assets. The results reported here have important implications for nature-based solutions as a major strategy to achieve sustainable development in some contexts.

Seasonality and inter-annual climatic variability, associated with shallow, acidic, and not very fertile soils, result in low productivity and rapid degradation of pasture quality, which requires the supplementation of animal feed. In this study, carried out in a biodiverse pasture field in the Mediterranean region of southern Portugal, the vegetation index (NDVI, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) obtained from measurements performed by a proximal optical sensor (PS) and satellite images (RS) was used to assess pasture quality parameters (pasture moisture content, PMC, crude protein, CP, and neutral detergent fiber, NDF). The monitoring was carried out throughout the 2021/2022 pasture growing season. Significant correlations were obtained between the NDVI obtained by PS and RS (R-2 of 0.84) and the reference values of pasture parameters obtained in laboratory protocols: PMC (R-2 of 0.88 and 0.78, respectively), CP (R-2 of 0.67 and 0.63, respectively), and NDF (R-2 of 0.50 and 0.46, respectively). This case study also demonstrated the spatial and temporal variability of vegetative vigour and, consequently, of pasture quality in the Montado, the characteristic Mediterranean ecosystem. These results show the pertinence of these technologies in supporting the decision-making process of the farm manager, namely, to estimate the supplementation needs of animals in critical phases, especially after the spring production peak and before the autumn production peak.

However, the multiyear averaged monthly GVF climatology-the most commonly used representation of the vegetation state in models-cannot capture the real-time vegetation state well. In this study, a near real-time (NRT) GVF dataset generated from an 8-day composite of the normalized difference vegetation index is compared with the 10-yr averaged monthly GVF provided by the WRF model. The annual variability of the GVF over North China is examined in detail. Many differences between the two GVF datasets are found over dryland, grassland, and cropland/grassland mosaic areas. Two experiments using different GVF datasets are performed to assess the impacts of GVF on forecasts of screen-level temperature and humidity. The results show that using NRT GVF can lead to a widespread reduction of 2-m temperature forecast errors from April to October. Evaluation against in-situ observations shows that the positive impact on 2-m temperature forecasts in the morning is more distinct than that in the afternoon. Our study demonstrates that NRT GVF can provide a more realistic representation of the vegetation state, which in turn helps to improve short-range forecasts in arid and semiarid regions of North China. Moreover, our study shows that the negative effect of using NRT GVF is closely related to the initial soil moisture.

However, the impact of crop rotations on soil biology is not as well understood. Nematode communities reflect soil quality and are directly observable, readily quantifiable, and occupy most of the consumer trophic levels in the soil food web. Within more humid climates, the community structure is better characterized to make associations with soil health and crop management strategies, but little is known about their community structure in semiarid regions such as the NGP. For this study, soils under contrasting cropping systems were sampled in the 15th year of a long-term study to quantify and assess the nematode community. Prior to planting, wheat-chemical fallow had a higher total nematode population than that of wheat-filled fallow (P < 0.05). A wheat-pulse system with a history of crop perennation had a greater abundance of uncommon, omnivorous nematodes than a wheat-pulse system without a prior history of crop perennation. However, plant parasitic nematodes also were higher in abundance under the converted perennial system. Our results suggest that reducing soil disturbance and including a perennial component to cropping systems will foster a more diverse and balanced nematode community under semiarid dryland conditions, but potentially at the expense of increased plant parasitic nematode pressure.

The use of models to evaluate the performance of agricultural systems, as they exist in the real world, can be challenging and plagued with constraints. This is due to the difficulty in characterizing the spatial variability across the landscape of crops, soils, weather, management, miscellaneous stress factors, and the initial state of the system. We propose the use of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) estimated from remote sensing images and simple crop growth-transpiration algorithms as an alternative to the use of standalone crop models for real-world yield assessment. In this study, we combined ETa estimates from METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution with Internalized Calibration) with simple crop growth algorithms extracted from the CropSyst model to estimate biomass production and yield at high resolution (30 by 30 m). We tested this approach in four dryland agriculture sites in eastern Washington State with contrasting annual precipitation. All sites were equipped with an eddy covariance flux tower for ground ETa estimation. The proposed approach was able to provide good estimates of ETa, seasonal change of aboveground biomass and yields at all sites when compared with observations for a 3-year period, collectively including five different annual crops. Because estimations are made at high resolution, they can be scaled up to field or regional scales. Advantages and limitations of the proposed approach are discussed.

Many desert grasslands are undergoing rapid changes in vegetation, including the encroachment of woody plants, which alters fire regimes and in turn can change the spatial and temporal patterns of aeolian sediment transport. We investigated aeolian sediment transport and spatial distribution of sediment in the surface soil for 7 years following a prescribed fire using a multiple rare Earth element (REE) tracer-based approach in a shrub-encroached desert grassland in the northern Chihuahuan desert. Results indicate that even though the aeolian horizontal sediment mass flux increased approximately three-fold in the first windy season in the burned areas compared to control areas, there were no significant differences after three windy seasons. The soil surface of bare microsites was the major contributor of aeolian sediments in unburned areas (87%), while the shrub microsites contributed the least (<2%) during the observation period. However, after the prescribed fire, the contribution of aeolian sediments from shrub microsites increased considerably (similar to 40%), indicating post-fire microsite-scale sediment redistribution. The findings of this study, which is the first to use multiple REE tracers for multi-year analysis of the spatial and temporal dynamics of aeolian sediment transport, illustrate how disturbance by prescribed fire can influence aeolian processes and alters dryland soil geomorphology in which distinct soils develop over time at very fine spatial scales of individual plants.

Characterization of a novel polyextremotolerant fungus, Exophiala viscosa, with insights into its melanin regulation and ecological niche	G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS												Black yeasts are polyextremotolerant fungi that contain high amounts of melanin in their cell wall and maintain a primar yeast form. These fungi grow in xeric, nutrient depletes environments which implies that they require highly flexible metabolisms and have been suggested to contain the ability to form lichen-like mutualisms with nearby algae and bacteria. However, the exact ecological niche and interactions between these fungi and their surrounding community are not well understood. We have isolated 2 novel black yeasts from the genus Exophiala that were recovered from dryland biological soil crusts. Despite notable differences in colony and cellular morphology, both fungi appear to be members of the same species, which has been named Exophiala viscosa (i.e. E. viscosa JF 03-3 Goopy and E. viscosa JF 03-4F Slimy). A combination of whole genome sequencing, phenotypic experiments, and melanin regulation experiments have been performed on these isolates to fully characterize these fungi and help decipher their fundamental niche within the biological soil crust consortium. Our results reveal that E. viscosa is capable of utilizing a wide variety of carbon and nitrogen sources potentially derived from symbiotic microbes, can withstand many forms of abiotic stresses, and excretes melanin which can potentially provide ultraviolet resistance to the biological soil crust community. Besides the identification of a novel species within the genus Exophiala, our study also provides new insight into the regulation of melanin production in polyextremotolerant fungi.

The goal is to evaluate the sensitivity of four indices of meteorological drought from five weather stations in Sinaloa for the prediction of rainfed maize yield. Using DrinC software and data from the period 1982-2013, the following were calculated: the standardized precipitation index (SPI), agricultural standardized precipitation index (aSPI), reconnaissance drought index (RDI) and effective reconnaissance drought index (eRDI). The observed rainfed maize yield (RMYob) was obtained online, through free access from the database of the Agrifood and Fisheries Information Service of the government of Mexico. Sensitivities between the drought indices and RMYob were estimated using Pearson and Spearman correlations. Predictive models of rainfed maize yield (RMYpr) were calculated using multiple linear and nonlinear regressions. In the models, aSPI and eRDI with reference periods and time steps of one month (January), two months (December-January) and three months (November-January), were the most sensitive. The correlation coefficients between RMYob and RMYpr ranged from 0.423 to 0.706, all being significantly different from zero. This study provides new models for the early calculation of RMYpr. Through appropriate planning of the planting-harvesting cycle of dryland maize, substantial socioeconomic damage can be avoided in one of the most important agricultural regions of Mexico.

Here we conducted a meta-analysis of the RF effects on maize yield, ET and WUE based on the data collected from peer-reviewed literature. Yield, ET and WUE varied with climate, soil and mulching management. Averaged across all the geographic locations, RF increased the yield and WUE of maize by 47 Wo and 39 %, respectively, but no effects on ET. An increase in the yield and WUE occurred under RF in regions regardless of the mean growing season air temperature (MT) or a mean precipitation during the growing season (MP), although there was a trend that RF is more beneficial under low MP. RF also decreased ET in regions with MT > 12 degrees C. RF increased the yield and WUE in regions with medium or fine soil texture. RF increased the yield, ET, and WUE in regions with low soil bulk density (BD) (<= 1.3 g cm(-3)). But in areas where BD is larger than 1.3 g cm(-3), RF only increased the yield and WUE. RF increased the yield and WUE with or without mulching, but decreased ET when no mulching was used. Together, optimizing RF effects on the yield, ET and WUE in maize was largely dependent on environmental conditions and management practices.

However, quantitative information regarding the effects of tillage and N application rates on micronutrient dynamics is limited. The objectives of this study were (a) to determine the long-term effect of different tillage methods as well as variation in N application rates on the distribution of Mehlich III extractable manganese, copper, zinc, boron, and iron in soils and (b) to assess accumulation of the same nutrients in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) tissues. The system studied was under a dryland winter wheat-fallow (WW-F) rotation. Tillage methods included moldboard (MP), disk (DP) and sweep (SW), and the N application rates were 0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 kg ha(-1). The concentration of soil manganese was greater under DP (131 mg kg(-1)) than under MP (111 mg kg(-1)). Inorganic N application reduced extractable soil copper while, it increased manganese accumulation in wheat grain over time. Comparison of micronutrients with adjacent long-term (since 1931) undisturbed grass pasture revealed that the WW-F plots had lost at least 43% and 53% of extractable zinc and copper, respectively, after 75 years of N fertilization and tillage. The results indicate that DP and inorganic N application could reduce the rate of micronutrient decline in soil and winter wheat grain over time compared to MP and no N fertilization.

The good with the bad: when ecological restoration facilitates native and non-native species	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Organisms interact with each other along a spectrum ranging from competition to facilitation. A theme in restoration ecology is tipping the balance of these interactions to favor desired species and site conditions, exemplified by restoring fertile islands and their nurse plant effects to encourage plant recruitment. We tested the effectiveness of outplanting nursery-grown native perennials and vertical mulching (placing dead plant material upright in soil) for stimulating annual plant recruitment in a disturbed Mojave Desert shrubland in Joshua Tree National Park, California, U.S.A. Over 9 years, differences in annual species richness and cover between interspaces and below outplants and vertical mulch varied among years, potentially via inter-annual fluctuations in precipitation or maturation of restoration sites. In the ninth year, which was the wettest, both native and non-native cover averaged 3x higher below outplants than in interspaces. Overall among years at the microsite scale, non-native annual plants more consistently exploited environments provided by outplants and vertical mulch structures than did native annuals. However, these restoration structures were important for native annual diversity. At the 40-m(2) plot scale, disturbed plots that received outplanting supported greater richness of native annual species than disturbed unrestored plots. By facilitating both non-native and native plants, reestablishing fertile islands to restore dryland ecosystems is a conundrum for restoration. Treatments reducing non-native plants may need to accompany fertile island restoration to tip the balance of facilitative plant interactions in favor of native species.																			1061-2971	1526-100X				MAR	2019	27	2					343	351		10.1111/rec.12874	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.12874													WOS:000461699300012

However, the sensitivity of these sensors to the soil texture and bulk density demands calibration before conducting determinations. In the present study, we calibrated two soil moisture sensors (TDR-315L and Diviner 2000) for six common soil types found on the Loess Plateau, China. The root mean square error (RMSE), ratio of the lack-of-fit mean square error and mean square pure error were calculated to compare the accuracies of the sensors and models. The results indicated that TDR-315L was more accurate than Diviner 2000 for all of the samples. A new model that includes the bulk density and clay content obtained higher accuracy when calibrating the TDR-315L sensor. And it is showed that the RMSE of volumetric water content (VWC) from the new model compared to the gravimetry are less than 0.039 m(3) m(-3). For the Diviner 2000 sensor, adjusting the parameters in the calibration model allowed the accurate estimation of the VWC, where the RMSE of VWC from the calibration model compared to the gravimetry are less than 0.033 m(3) m(-3). The results obtained in this study may facilitate the use of sensors in soil moisture observational networks and environmental and hydrological applications.						junchao, jia/0000-0003-3456-0252													0266-0032	1475-2743				JUL	2021	37	3					584	594		10.1111/sum.12587	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sum.12587		JUN 2020											WOS:000537088000001

Here, we evaluated how extreme precipitation events (EPEs) with antecedent dry (dry-EPEs) and wet (wet-EPEs) water conditions influence carbon exchange along gradient of arid, semi-arid, and sub-humid ecosystems based on eddy covariance datasets. After EPEs, ecosystem respiration and gross primary productivity (GPP) were stimulated by pulses of soil moisture in arid and semi-arid regions, but suppressed by decreased soil temperature in sub-humid region. Antecedent water condition determined asynchronous response of ecosystem respiration and GPP to EPEs, and therefore fluctuations in net carbon balance. Net carbon uptake capacity was enhanced immediately following wet-EPEs because of more rapid and greater response of GPP than respiration. However, after dry-EPEs, net carbon uptake capacity decreased immediately and increased thereafter because the response of GPP to dry-EPEs lagged behind ecosystem respiration. More antecedent precipitation further stimulated accumulative net carbon uptake. In general, the accumulated net carbon uptake within 3 weeks after wet-EPEs was two times and seven times of that after dry-EPEs in arid and semi-arid region, respectively. In sub-humid region, ecosystems acted as a carbon sink after wet-EPEs, but as a carbon source after dry-EPEs. We conclude that antecedent water conditions and local climate regimes need to be considered when interpreting the response of carbon exchange to EPEs in dryland ecosystems.

Although it is highly regarded for animal production in other countries and in Queensland, leucaena is a contentious species since its status as an environmental weed currently precludes it from use on pastoral leases in the Kimberley and Pilbara regions of WA. Development of sterile/seedless forms would overcome risks of spread of the species as a weed. The key environmental constraints to growth of leucaena are likely to be the length of the dry season and low fertility of most soils other than the grey/black cracking clays (vertosols). Psyllid resistance and cool temperature tolerance are likely to be of secondary importance. Opportunities for irrigated production are also emerging and may allow leucaena species to be used in environments previously considered well outside their home-range. It is desirable now to re-examine the diversity of the wider leucaena genus for adaptation to WA conditions generally and for the purpose of selecting elite parent material for use in a sterile/seedless leucaena breeding program. These perennial species that can be under production for 30 to 40 years need to be evaluated in the target environments for at least 3-5 years to fully understand their potential as adult plants.

Leaf and root nutrient concentrations and stoichiometry along aridity and soil fertility gradients	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions Leaf nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) concentrations and N : P ratio have been extensively studied along environmental gradients, but whether and how leaves and roots show similar responses to climatic and fertility gradients is little studied. Also, the responses of leaf and root N and P in different plant functional types (PFT; legumes, grasses, forbs and shrubs) to environmental gradients are poorly known. We examined the following two hypotheses: (a) P concentration and N : P ratios in leaves or fine roots would not be modulated by soil N for legumes while they would be for non-legume PFTs; (b) Species turnover would have stronger influence on the responses of N and P concentrations and N : P ratios of plant tissues along aridity and soil fertility gradients than intraspecific variation. Study site Ordos Plateau, China. Methods We collected samples of leaf and fine roots covering 95 species of 28 families across 17 sites affiliated to four vegetation types on the dry Ordos Plateau of North China and compared variations in N and P concentrations and N : P ratios in both leaves and fine roots among PFTs. Results We found that legumes had higher N concentrations in leaves and fine roots than the non-legume PFTs. Leaf and fine root P and N : P ratios increased with increasing soil N for most non-legume PFTs, but the relationships were decoupled for legumes. Species turnover had a stronger contribution to these relationships of N and P in leaves and fine roots along aridity and soil N gradients than intraspecific variation. Conclusions When modeling vegetation nutrient stocks and cycling, the predictive power could be improved by taking into account not only influences of soil fertility but also of climate on leaf and root tissue N and soil N on tissue P and N : P ratio, especially for non-legume functional types.

The priority in terms of the remediation measures was determining the cause of the seepages. Nine water and six soil samples were collected from the Al Tayseer area of the Wadi Bani Malik, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (SA). The water samples were analyzed for major and toxic metals. For the soil samples, granulometric analysis and infiltration rate analysis were performed. The total dissolved solids (TDS) in water seepages ranged from 1880 to 54,499, whereas boron (B) and iron (Fe) values ranged from 1.9 to 38 mg/L and 0.02 and 0.47 mg/L, respectively. These concentrations were the same for the aquifer in Lake Al Misk, confirming that groundwater infiltration from the lake area was the main reason for the water seepage. The concentrations of silica (Si), aluminum (Al), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), and lead (Pb) were low, indicating that there was no contamination. The nitrate (NO32-) value ranged from 2.2 to 35 mg/L, indicating agricultural wastewater contribution. According to the granulometric examination, most sediment was sand, followed by gravel, with few fine-grain particles. The infiltration rate ranged from 85 to 864 cm/d, indicating significant leakage. The percentage of ferrugination, ferromagnesian, OH-bearing, and carbonate (CO ₃2-) minerals is determined by the 4/2, 5/6, and 6/7 band ratios.						pande, chaitanya/0000-0003-1738-3565														2073-4441				OCT	2023	15	19							3464	10.3390/w15193464	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15193464													WOS:001081573700001

However, the moisture-conserving effect of straw mulching combined with phosphor fertilization on fertile florets per spike (FFS) and grain yield remains unclear. During the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 growing seasons, we investigated the combined effects of straw mulching (0 and 8000 kg ha-1) and phosphorus fertilization (0, 75, and 120 kg P2O5 ha-1) on spike development, assimilates' availability, and the photosynthetic properties of flag leaves by conducting a field experiment. Compared with no straw mulch control, straw mulching increased fertile spike, grain number per spike (15.6%), and grain yield (22.6%), and grain number per spike was the most important contribution to increasing wheat grain yield (46%). An increase in grain number per spike is associated with FFS. Compared with no straw mulch control, straw mulching increased FFS by 19.5%, and it increased with increasing phosphorus fertilization levels. Moreover, straw mulching combined with phosphorus fertilization promoted the light compensation point (LCP), light saturation point (LSP), net photosynthetic rate (Pn), Chl b, and the maximal photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) of flag leaves to produce carbohydrates. Our study has shown that the primary factor for the divergence in FFS under straw mulching and phosphorus application was the efficiency of assimilate utilization in the spike, which ultimately led to increased grain number per spike and grain yield.

SUSTAINABILITY												Sustainable water usage is an important global concern and an urgent priority, especially in dryland regions such as Iran. The Iranian government is actively addressing the challenge of water scarcity by encouraging farmers to adopt new water application technology. Its main element to decrease water consumption is to encourage new irrigation systems, in particular drip irrigation. However, despite the benefits of drip irrigation technologies and the availability of generous government subsidies, adoption rates of the improved irrigation technology remain critically low among Iranian farmers. Therefore, this study seeks to determine what is limiting the uptake of improved irrigation technology in Iran. While it is well known that acceptance of new technology ultimately depends on multiple and interrelated factors, we examine those factors affecting farmers' adoption from three theoretical perspectives in the adoption literature: farmers' socio-economic characteristics, social capital, and technology characteristics. A cross-sectional survey was undertaken in Behbahan district in Khuzestan province in southwest Iran. The sample comprises 174 farmers who adopted drip irrigation in that region and 100 non-adopters who were located in the same region. Discriminant analysis reveals that a socio-economic approach is the strongest model to predict adoption of drip irrigation technology in the study area, followed by models of technical characteristics, and social capital. These results can help agricultural extension agents and policy-makers design appropriate and effective strategies that facilitate the adoption of drip irrigation at an increasing rate.

J	Wu, L; Rossi, F; Lan, SB				Wu, Li; Rossi, Federico; Lan, Shubin			Potential mechanisms of soil nitrogen content heterogeneity associated with biocrust development in drylands	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are complex communities of micro- and macro-organisms dwelling at the soil surface in dryland regions worldwide, which contribute to important ecological functions in these areas. Biocrusts may reach different developmental stages, associated to autogenic succession of specific phototrophic organisms. However, notwithstanding the large amount of existing literature, little is known regarding the relationship between biocrust stages of development and soil nutrient dynamics. In this opinion paper, we specifically focused on soil nitrogen, and compared the total nitrogen content and potential nitrogenase activity of different developmental types of biocrust (-covered) soils. Based on published reports, we looked at a possible relationship between nitrogen content at the soil surface and biocrust development, discussing the potential mechanisms leading to the observed soil nitrogen content heterogeneity. The results showed that a higher nitrogen content remained associated to the presence of moss-dominated biocrusts, and this biocrust morphotype was characterized by a lower potential nitrogenase activity compared to the cyanobacteria- and/or lichen-dominated biocrusts. We hypothesized that these seemingly contradictory findings might be attributed to three potential mechanisms: nitrogen inheritance, nutrient retention and nutrient transfer, which we hereby examined one by one. Altogether, our opinion supports the theory of biocrust succession from incipient cyanobacteria-dominated stages to more 'mature' stages dominated by mosses. We stress how the heterogeneous distribution of soil nitrogen, which is closely related with biocrust development and community types, eventually affects regional and even global nitrogen dynamic and storage.

In this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to examine the microbial community at Dafeng Mine, the Helan Mountains, Ningxia, China. Soil microbial communities were analyzed with four different materials: 100% straw, 50% straw-50% coconut, and 100% coconut vegetation blanket types, and a bare ground control (CK). The results showed that the contents of soil total nitrogen (TN), available potassium (AP), urease, and catalase were significantly increased in different types of vegetation blankets. High-throughput sequencing showed that the straw vegetation blanket increased bacterial diversity, while the coconut vegetation blanket increased fungal diversity. The main influencing factors of the dominant bacterial phylum were total nitrogen, catalase, urease, protease, soil water content (WC), soil organic carbon (SOC), and electrical conductivity (EC). The main influencing factor of the dominant fungal phylum was soil water content. These results show that compared with straw vegetation blankets, coconut, and straw-coconut vegetation blanket mulches are more likely to improve soil physicochemical properties, increase the diversity and abundance of soil microorganisms and improve the structural composition of the community, thus improving the soil environment in dryland mining areas. However, further research is needed as to which is the more significant environmental improvement, coconut or straw-coconut vegetation blankets.						wang, ziyin/0000-0002-5828-7345													1085-3278	1099-145X				2023 SEP 4	2023										10.1002/ldr.4881	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4881		SEP 2023											WOS:001057585200001

However, their dynamics in response to variations in sowing techniques are poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the effects of wide-ridge and narrow-furrow (WR&NF), film-mulching ridge (FMR), and conventional drilling (CD) practices on the activities of soil-residing enzymes and fungal communities in a dryland wheat field on the Loess Plateau. Photometrically, unbuffered, and colorimetric methods were employed to determine the activities of alkaline phosphatases, urease, and sucrase enzymes, respectively. Soil fungal diversity and community composition was measured via the Illumina Miseq 2500 sequencing method. The results revealed that WR&NF and FMR practices significantly enhanced the soil activities of alkaline phosphatases, urease, and sucrase, while improving soil fungal communities including Chytridiomycota phylum and Phoma (Ascomycota), Olpidium (Chytridiomycota), and Trichosporon (Basidiomycota) genera. Both the enzymatic activities and fungal community compositions of the soils under study varied from rhizosphere to non-rhizosphere, as well as at different soil depths. Remarkably, several soil fungal genera, including Cystofilobasidium (Basidiomycota), Triparticalcar (Chytridiomycota), and Guehomyces (Basidiomycota) were more abundant in the subsoil than topsoil. In general, we observed that ridge-furrow and film-mulching practices enhanced the enzyme activities and improved fungal communities of soils. Therefore, the wide-ridge and narrow-furrow sowing technique is recommended as an environmentally compatible practice to benefit the arid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) fields of the Loess Plateau.

Life cycle assessment of wheat production and wheat-based crop rotations	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												In the northern Great Plains (NGP), wheat is the primary grain commodity. There is a need for the NGP to have a detailed analysis of environmental impacts for wheat-based agricultural production systems to better understand regional agroecosystems. This article provides a cradle-to-field gate life cycle assessment (LCA) for NGP dryland wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production. The environmental impacts for winter wheat production using crop rotation and agricultural intensification are quantified. Fourteen no-till crop rotations ranging in duration from 2 to 6 yr were evaluated and compared using data from a historical 13-yr replicated rotation study (>300 observations). Midpoint LCA categories chosen for this comparison are energy, agricultural land use, climate change potential, freshwater eutrophication, and freshwater ecotoxicity due to their direct links with agricultural management practices. The NGP farmers commonly use a fallow period every other year due to moisture limitations. This specific agricultural practice and allocations within rotations are critical considerations within agricultural LCAs. Two aspects of fallow considerations and a sensitivity analysis were also performed. The allocated midpoint impacts between crops in rotational studies averaged 0.31, 0.79, 0.62, and 0.63 kg CO2 eq. per unit of winter wheat when energy, economic, mass, and cereal unit allocations were used, respectively. Economic analysis of the studied experimental crop was performed; results demonstrated that crop insurance policies improved diversification economics by 20%. Agricultural diversification benefits and burdens were better represented by endpoint damage assessments than by midpoint impact analysis.

Temperature and precipitation are the main driving climatic factors affecting agricultural productivity and, in dryland pastures, the hydrological cycle of soil, identified by soil moisture content (SMC), is the main engine of the vegetation development. The objective of this work was to evaluate the normalized difference water index (NDWI) based on Sentinel-2 imagery as a tool for monitoring pasture seasonal dynamics and inter-annual variability in a Mediterranean agro-silvo-pastoral system. Forty-one valid NDWI records were used between January and June 2016 and between January 2017 and June 2018. The 2.3 ha experimental field is located within the Mitra farm, in the South of Portugal. Soil moisture content, pasture moisture content (PMC), pasture surface temperature (T-ir), pasture biomass productivity and pasture quality degradation index (PQDI) were evaluated in 12 satellite pixels (10 m x 10 m). The results show significant correlations (p < 0.01) between NDWI and: (i) SMC (R-2 = 0.7548); (ii) PMC (R-2 = 0.8938); (iii) T-ir (R-2 = 0.5428); (iv) biomass (R-2 = 0.7556); and (v) PQDI (R-2 = 0.7333). These findings suggest that satellite-derived NDWI can be used in site-specific management of montado ecosystem to support farmers' decision making.						/0000-0001-5178-8158; Marques da Silva, Jose Rafael/0000-0003-0305-8147														2073-4441				JAN	2019	11	1							62	10.3390/w11010062	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11010062													WOS:000459735100061

Compared to continuous grazing (CG), which is based on a permanent and low stocking rate, DG is a management strategy that aims at optimizing the use of the resources available in the Mediterranean Montado ecosystem. This study with sheep grazing, carried out between 2019 and 2021 on a 4 ha pasture in Alentejo region of the Southern of Portugal, assesses the impact of these two grazing management systems on soil compaction as a result of animal trampling. This area of native natural grassland (a dryland pasture, mixture of grasses, legumes, and composite species) was divided into four grazing parks of 1 ha each, two under DG management and two under CG management. At the end of the study, the cone index (CI, in kPa) was measured in the topsoil layer (0-30 cm) with an electronic cone penetrometer at 48 georeferenced areas (12 in each park). The results of CI measurement showed no significant differences between treatments in all depths measured (0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm). These findings are encouraging from the point of view of soil conservation and sustainability, revealing good prospects for the intensification of extensive livestock production. Future work should evaluate the long-term impact and consider, at the same time, other ecosystem services and system productivity indicators.

However, no studies have examined how plant leaf carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) stoichiometry responds to abiotic and biotic factors in the fragile desert-grassland ecological tran-sition zone in northern China. Then a systematically designed 400 km transect was established to investigate the C, N, and P stoichiometry of 870 leaf samples of 61 species from 47 plant communities in the desert-grassland transition zone. At the individual level, plant taxonomic groups and life forms rather than climate or soil factors determined the leaf C, N, and P stoichiometry. In addition, leaf C, N, and P stoichiometry (except leaf C) was significantly influ-enced by soil moisture content in the desert-grassland transition zone. At the community level, leaf C content showed a considerable interspecific variation (73.41 %); however, the variation in leaf N and P content, as well as C:N and C:P ratios, was mainly due to intraspecific variation, which was in turn driven by soil moisture. We suggested that intra-specific trait variation played a key role in regulating community structure and function to enhance the resistance and resilience of plant communities to climate change in the desert-grassland transition zone. Our results highlighted the role of soil moisture content as a critical parameter for modeling the biogeochemical cycling in dryland plant-soil systems.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				AUG 1	2023	884								163902	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163902	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163902		MAY 2023						37137371					WOS:001006285500001

In this paper, an intercomparison of KOMPSAT-5 and C-band Sentinel-1 radar data in soil moisture retrieval was conducted over agricultural fields in Wimmera, Victoria, Australia. Optical images from Sentinel-2 were also used to calculate the scattering contribution of vegetation. This study employed a new semi-empirical vegetation scattering model with a linear association of soil moisture with observed backscatter coefficient and vegetation indices. The Combined Vegetation Index (CVI) was proposed and first used to parameterize vegetation water content. As a result, the vegetation scattering model was developed to monitor soil moisture based on remotely sensed data and ground measurements. Application of the algorithm over dryland wheat field sites demonstrated that the estimated satellite-based soil moisture contents have good linear relationships with the ground measurements. The correlation coefficients (R) are 0.862 and 0.616, and the root mean square errors (RMSEs) have the values of 0.020 cm(3)/cm(3) and 0.032 cm(3)/cm(3) at X- and C-bands, respectively. Furthermore, the validation results also indicated that X-band provided higher consistent accuracy for soil moisture inversion than C-band. These results showed significant promise in retrieving soil moisture using KOMPSAT-5 and Sentinel-1 remotely sensed data at high-spatial resolution over agricultural fields, with subsequent uses for crop growth and yield estimation.

Daikichi)	JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE												BACKGROUND: Taro (Colocasia esculenta cv. Daikichi) is believed to be one of the earliest cultivated tuber crops and it is a staple food in many parts of the world. The mother corm and side cormels (daughter and granddaughter tubers) form the major consumed parts; however, the former is rarely preferred. Taro is mainly cultivated using either unflooded or flooding cultivation, under dryland-rainfed and wetland-irrigated conditions, respectively. Although flooding cultivation has several advantages, such as lower risk of diseases, weeds, and insect pests, contributing to increased tuber yield, its effects on the quality characteristics of the tubers are largely unknown. In this study, the effects of controlled flooding cultivation on the quality of mother corm and side cormels were investigated. Their taste, color, physical properties, antioxidant activity, and starch, oxalic acid, nitrate ion, arabinogalactan (AG)/AG protein (AGP), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and total polyphenol content was compared with those under unflooded cultivation. RESULTS: Flooding cultivation increased polyphenol levels and antioxidant activity and decreased oxalate, nitrate ion, GABA, and AG/AGP levels. Flooding cultivation also reduced the harshness and increased the hardness and stickiness of steamed mother corm paste, generally discarded under unflooded cultivation, thus rendering it suitable for consumption. CONCLUSION: Controlled flooding cultivation has economic advantages and the potential to improve the quality of cultivated taro. (c) 2021 The Authors.

This study was conducted to investigate the effects of organic and inorganic amendments on spring wheat (Triticum aestivum UG99) yield and salts redistribution within the profile of a repacked saline-sodic silt loam soil (ECe = 12.9 dS m(-1), exchangeable sodium percent (ESP) = 17.6% for control). The experimental design for greenhouse study was completely random with two factors (amendment and leaching fraction, LF). The amendments included biochar (2%) [B], biochar + manure (2%) [BM], zeolite modified with CaCl2 (2%) [ZC], super absorbent (1%) [SA], and a control (no amendment) considering two levels of LF (15 and 30%). All amendments, except ZC, decreased soil bulk density and electrical conductivity, and increased soil pH and water content at field capacity after 2 pore volumes leaching. There was positive effect (p < .001) of B, BM and SA on wheat ground cover and grain yield; ZC amendment had no effect on wheat growth or yield. The LF levels did not affect wheat growth or yield.

Nitrogen and potassium fertilization in no-till hard red spring wheat production	AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES & ENVIRONMENT												There is a need to develop more efficient nutrient management strategies to maximize wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain yields and increase grain protein levels. Urea, most widely used N fertilizer, is susceptible to substantial losses, resulting in low nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). This study assessed the effect of N and K fertilization on hard red spring wheat production under dryland no-till conditions in Montana. A field experiment was conducted during one growing season at two locations in Northcentral Montana. Fertilizer N was applied as urea (46-0-0) or as a urea-KCl (50:50 blend) at planting to achieve two target N rates, 135 and 270 kg N ha(-1). Biomass weight, N content, and sensor-based Normalized Vegetative Difference Index (NDVI), yield, test weight, and grain protein content of wheat was evaluated. Results indicated that: (a) N may increase wheat grain quality (protein content) even when wheat yield is not increased, (b) KCl application, along with N, may result in greater wheat biomass production and grain protein values, and (c) NDVI may be more sensitive to the amount of produced biomass than to N content of that biomass. In conclusion, even if yield response to N is minimal, N is beneficial for improving grain protein content of wheat. Addition of KCl along with N may produce greater wheat biomass and increase biomass N content. The NDVI may be more sensitive to the amount of produced biomass than to its N content.

In situ permeameter tests are widely used to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of streambed sediments. Previous studies have demonstrated that one of the major factors controlling spatiotemporal variations in streambed hydraulic conductivity in such areas is streambed clogging by suspended sediments. Recently, a modified Hvorslev (1951) formula was theoretically proposed to account for the effect of streambed clogging on streambed hydraulic properties due to suspended particle sedimentation during falling-head tests. To validate the modified formula, fieldwork was conducted at five sites in the lower Heihe River, a typical intermittent river of north-western China, in September 2017. A simple PVC pipe with an inner diameter of 4 cm was used as a permeameter for the field tests. Both muddy river water and clean water were used to fill the permeameter to conduct comparative tests. To differentiate the interpretation of the field testing data obtained with clean water, the data obtained with muddy river water were analysed with an equation considering an iteratively increasing total hydraulic resistance of riverbed sediments due to the effects of riverbed clogging. The estimated vertical hydraulic conductivity for the top 0.3 m of riverbed sediments varied from 1 to 41 m/day. The proposed model was shown to accurately estimate the hydraulic conductivity of riverbed sediments using both clean and muddy water during slug tests.

J	Gladish, DW; He, D; Wang, E				Gladish, Daniel W.; He, Di; Wang, Enli			Pattern analysis of Australia soil profiles for plant available water capacity	GEODERMA												Plant available water capacity (PAWC), defined as the amount of water held in the soil between the drained upper limit (DUL) and crop lower limit (CLL), is a major determinant for crop yield in dryland cropping areas. However, measured soil profile data quantifying the physical soil parameters that determine PAWC are limited. Choosing a 'representative' soil profile in order to parameterise a deterministic model is often subjective and may not be appropriate, leading to biased conclusions. To help support these deterministic crop modelling studies, we analysed soil profile data in Australia available in the APSoil database; a database of field and laboratory measured physical soil properties used to parameterise the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model. Specifically, we developed typical soil pattern profiles utilizing wheat for CLL using statistical shape analysis and cluster analysis. Our method allows modellers to reduce the number of soil profile parameter choices using a statistically sound basis. We implement our method by grouping the APSoil soil profiles into five clusters, whereby each cluster is represented by a more general soil profile. The representative soil profiles reflect impact of the soil texture on PAWC. The five clusters and representative soil profiles can then be used in future modelling studies to investigate the impact of soil variation on systems performance. In turn, soil scientists will have a plausible and quantifiable collection of soil profiles to choose from for future studies.

Assessment of the Seedling Resistance of Spring Wheat Lines to <i>Fusarium culmorum</i>	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES-TARIM BILIMLERI DERGISI												Wheat diseases are one of the constraints limiting wheat yields wherever the crop is grown. Fusarium crown rot, incited by Fusarium culmorum, is one of the most important diseases limiting wheat yields especially in dryland areas. Although there are no wheat varieties which are fully resistant to crown rot, the use of varieties showing some degree of resistance is the most reliable and cost effective method to control this disease. In this study, seedling reactions of 165 spring wheat breeding lines (Triticum aestivum L.) obtained from CIMMYT, Mexico were determined under growth room conditions using an aggressive isolate of Fusarium culmorum. Crown rot severity was assessed using a 1-5 scale. The mean disease severity scores for the lines tested ranged from 1.4 to 4.4. Two out of the 165 lines tested (lines 147 and 158) were resistant (R) in their reaction and had scores of 1.4. Twenty lines showed moderately resistant (MR) reaction and had scores ranging from 1.6 to 2.4. The scores of both the R and MR lines were not significantly different from scores of MR control cultivars. Sixty-three percent of the lines were moderately susceptible (MS). Out of the 165 lines tested, 39 were susceptible (S) in their reaction. The promising wheat lines that showed some degree of resistance to Fusarium culmorum in the present study can serve as useful sources of genetic resistance in breeding for Fusarium crown rot.

However, there has been little research on the mechanism underlying C-, N-, P-accumulation and overall fertile island at the community level. We therefore presented the systematic investigation on this issue through the survey in desert-oasis ecotone. The survey covering the vegetation composition, plant height, crown area and vegetation cover. The main parameters measured included soil moisture, soil pH, soil salinity and nine soil indicators related to C, N and P cycling. The results revealed that the effect of fertile island was directly relevant to either soil moisture or pH. This effect was more obvious with the increase of soil moisture and the decrease of pH value. In addition, the plant diversitywas believed to be the main biotic driven factor for fertile island. Furthermore, the results also indicated that both the soil moisture and plant diversity would accelerate the accumulation of P and N, while the pH played the negative effect. The other main observation obtained was that the vegetation cover had positive effect on accumulation of C. As a result, the mechanisms related to drought and salinization could drive the difference of C-, N- and P-accumulation. The main findings also provided an effective reference to better understand the mechanism of fertile island and its desertification procedure in desert-oasis ecotone. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

For example, it is possible to recognize and extract a number of features related to forest type, forest management, degradation and disturbance using VHR imagery. Moreover, time series of medium-to-high-resolution imagery such as MODIS, Landsat or Sentinel has allowed for monitoring of parameters related to forest cover change. Although automatic classification is used regularly to monitor forests using medium-resolution imagery, VHR imagery and changes in web-based technology have opened up new possibilities for the role of visual interpretation in forest observation. Visual interpretation of VHR is typically employed to provide training and/or validation data for other remote sensing-based techniques or to derive statistics directly on forest cover/forest cover change over large regions. Hence, this paper reviews the state of the art in tools designed for visual interpretation of VHR, including Geo-Wiki, LACO-Wiki and Collect Earth as well as issues related to interpretation of VHR imagery and approaches to quality assurance. We have also listed a number of success stories where visual interpretation plays a crucial role, including a global forest mask harmonized with FAO FRA country statistics; estimation of dryland forest area; quantification of deforestation; national reporting to the UNFCCC; and drivers of forest change.

Market Study and Marketing Strategy for Olive and Olive Oil Sector in the Southern Arid Part of Jordan	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												This study aimed at characterizing the livelihood of communities in term of their assets and opportunities and identifying and describing the corresponding market segment(s), as well as devising a suitable marketing strategy that would ultimately lead to more effective community engagement. A socio-economic questionnaire was designed to elicit basic numerical data on olive production, and marketing system of olive and olive oil, and agricultural practices. The study was conducted during 2014-2015 for 155 farmers, distributed in four sub-governorates in Karak Governorate. Research findings and SWOT analysis shows that the Jordanian Olive Sector in general, and Karak Olive Sector in particular, has a good potential to grow and expand further, particularly in light of recent developments that the sector has undergone and the modernization of olive oil presses. However, the sector has a number of weaknesses that are restricting it from realizing its growth potential. Key weaknesses are related to fragmentation of the sector, labor availability, skills and work-ethic issues, marketing and branding, packaging, warehousing, lack of coordination with the olive oil presses as well as limited financial and management planning know-how. Finally, study of the enterprise budget of olive crop showed that the rate of olive oil production per hectare reached 650 kg, the average price was US$ 5.5 kg(-1), the Gross margin was US$ 200 ha(-1), with US$ (sic) net profit.

J	Thorndycraft, VR				Thorndycraft, Varyl Robert			Rapid terrace incision and Quaternary landscape evolution in central Patagonia	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												The debate over isostatic uplift versus discharge as drivers of Quaternary river incision is explored here through geospatial analysis of a similar to 250-m-relief terrace sequence from the Rio Pinturas (Argentine Patagonia). The geomorphic setting of the Canadon Caracoles reach allows evaluation of discharge as a driver of terrace incision because advancing ice during Pleistocene glaciations blocked Pacific drainage and routed meltwater from an expanded similar to 104-km(2) catchment to the Atlantic through the dryland steppe of the study area. Twenty-two terrace levels, some assigned to previously dated ice margins [Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 32-36, MIS 16, MIS 8 and MIS 2], were identified. Average net incision since 800 ka (similar to 0.34 m ka(-1)) exceeded regional uplift rates. The MIS 2 terraces, with ante quem and post quem age constraint on the timing of terrace formation, show that terrace incision was episodic and faster still during a transitional warming climate. Glacier recession and proglacial lake formation at similar to 18 ka led to rapid incision of similar to 11.7 m ka(-1) over a few millennia. River capture and negligible flow from similar to 15.0 ka caused fan-dammed lake formation on the valley floor and vertical stability during MIS 1. The Pinturas terraces demonstrate rapid incision can be driven by discharge and sediment dynamics.

Spatial patterning of Wyoming big sagebrush indicates negative density dependence	ECOSPHERE												Plants reflect resource use in their spatial patterning. Competition for limited resources-such as available soil water in a dryland ecosystem-drives establishment, growth, and mortality, resulting in shifts of spatial arrangement over time. We characterized the spatial patterning of two big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata subspecies wyomingensis) communities in the upper Green River Basin of Wyoming, USA. We mapped big sagebrush canopies in two, 100-m(2) sites and calculated plant neighborhoods as the area closer to a target plant than to any other plant. We assumed that neighborhoods were areas in which the target plant dominates resource use. We found that plant neighborhoods had strong, positive correlations with plant size, indicating that larger neighborhoods may access more belowground resources. We also found that the relationships between experienced crowding, that is, crowding index (CI) by an average neighbor, and neighborhood size, were consistently negative regardless of calculation method. We also found that the residuals of a regression of target plant biomass and neighborhood area were strongly related to the CI calculated via all methods. This means that plants with smaller neighborhoods than expected also experience the greatest crowding by an average neighbor. These results are consistent with negative density dependence and show that greater static crowding predicts smaller neighborhoods in two, undisturbed, intermediate-successional big sagebrush communities. In the future, similar studies of spatial patterning that include interspecific plant-plant interactions will be useful for understanding the relationship between spatial patterning and negative density dependence.

However, most studies exploring the spatial distribution of soil bacterial communities have focused on the top 10-20 cm of soil, leaving our knowledge of the composition, diversity, and forces structuring subsoil communities relatively unexplored. Moreover, in agricultural soil managed without tillage (no-till), fertilizers often generate an acidified soil layer in the seed zone, rendering no-till soils a unique system in which to study the relative impacts of pH and soil depth on microbial communities. We characterize the composition and diversity of bacterial communities in a no-till wheat-based cropping system from eastern Washington, across soil depths (0 cm, 10 cm, 25 cm, 50 cm, 75 cm, and 100 cm). Soil depth was a strong driver of bacterial community composition and diversity. Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria dominated the soil surface, Acidobacteria peaked in relative abundance at 10 cm, and Actinobacteria and unidentified taxa were greatest in relative abundance below 25 cm. However, acidified soil disrupted relationships between soil depth and bacterial communities, resulting in a low diversity and distinct composition of bacterial communities at the 10 cm depth. Co-occurrence networks of bacterial taxa revealed groups of co-occurring taxa that responded primarily to soil pH or depth. This work provides an insight on the distribution and drivers of bacterial communities in deep soil profiles in dryland wheat-based cropping systems.

The Chilean water market, one of the main examples of the application of neoliberal policies in water management, has received mixed appraisals although, at present, few empirical studies evaluate the social and environmental conditions associated with their operation. This paper, on the contrary, maintains the necessity to assess the capacity of market-based models to face situations of water stress, particularly since mega-drought phenomena are projected to become a recurring and increasing problem during the following decades because of climate change. The study offers a mixed bottom-up and top-down qualitative empirical analysis of how the Chilean water market operates, providing relevant insights into four dimensions of the social-ecological resilience of the watershed: redundancy, diversity and flexibility; connectivity, collaboration and collective action; social-ecological memory and learning; self-organization and governance of system changes. The conclusion is that water scarcity is self-produced: despite the flexibility provided by market-based water management, the combined effect of strong deregulation, of the absence of territorial planning and integrated management of water resources, and of short-term attitudes and generalized mistrust, has led the system to the critical situation it is now facing.

At the same time, inappropriate agricultural practices are causing widespread soil degradation. Improved management of soil resources and identification of the potential agricultural capability of soils is therefore needed to prevent further land degradation, particularly in dryland areas such as Egypt. Here, we present a case study in the El-Fayoum depression (Northern Egypt) to model and map soil suitability for 12 typical Mediterranean crops. Two management scenarios were analyzed: the current situation (CS) and an optimal scenario (OS) of soil variables. The Almagra model was applied to estimate soil suitability under CS and OS. Management options based on the CS assessment were proposed to reduce some limiting factors: a fixed value of 2 dSm(-1) for soil salinity and 5% for sodium saturation; these defined the OS. Under optimal management, the OS scenario showed potential, where a notable increase of the area covered by a high suitability class (around 80%) for annual and semi-annual crops was observed. There was also a marked increase (about 70% for CS and 50% for OS) for perennial crops shifting from the marginal to moderate soil suitability class. The results reveal the importance of proper management to massively alter soil suitability into better states in order to achieve sustainable land use in this fertile agro-ecosystem.

The Tangbai River Basin (TRB), a watershed crossing Henan province and Hubei province, China, forms one of the nation's most productive agricultural regions. The TRB has been exposed to high doses of fertilizers for a long time. This study simulates hydrologic and nutrient cycling in the TRB using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) with limited data available. The results indicate that dryland fields, which constitute 62% of the basin area, produce 80% of total nitrogen (TN) and 85% of total phosphorus (TP) yields of the whole river basin. The water quality of river sections at the provincial boundary shows that only 29% of the time from 2000 to 2019 met the Class III standard regarding TN and TP concentrations, and the concentrations in the spring flood season are approximately three times the mean in the non-flood season. The Grain for Green ecological restoration measure in Henan province shows that restoration of non-flat drylands can reduce nutrient loads at trans-provincial sections by 3.5 times compared to that of slope-independent drylands; however, the water quality compliance rate remains similar. The value of ecological compensation can also vary widely depending on different quantitative criteria.

The 142 km(2) watershed drains to the Rio Grande.& nbsp;Study focus: This study evaluated the impacts of urbanization and stormwater infrastructure on ephemeral channel transmission loss (TL), an important source of groundwater recharge in dryland basins. A hydrologic model (HEC-HMS) was built for the watershed and calibrated based on seven years of precipitation and discharge data. The model was then used to simulate the individual and combined impacts of land use change (urbanization) and stormwater infrastructure (ponds, channel lining) on runoff and transmission losses over a ten-year period based on observed storm events.& nbsp;New hydrological insights for the region: Results show high inter-annual runoff variability with the two wettest years contributing 44-59% of the 10-year total, and dry years resulting in nearly no flow. Both runoff and TL increased with urbanization. Assuming natural ephemeral channels, TL comprised 64-81% of runoff reaching the basin outlet and 7-10% of domestic water use in the basin, depending on urbanization scenario. Stormwater detention ponds had minimal impact on TL; however, lining the lower 5, 10 and 15 km of ephemeral streams reduced TL by 31%, 55% and 73% over the ten-year study period. Results indicate that preservation of ephemeral channels, in particular permeable channel beds, should be considered a viable strategy for managed aquifer recharge in urbanizing areas.

Divergent Patterns and Spatial Heterogeneity of Soil Nutrients in a Complex and Dynamic Savanna Landscape	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Many grassy ecosystems around the world are experiencing woody encroachment. These woody encroachers often cause nutrient enrichment in the plant-soil environment, potentially facilitating their growth and reproduction. However, studies of encroachment effects on nutrient distributions have been confined to a few major elements (e.g., N, and P) and limited in spatial extent. We analyzed 19 elements in dominant plants and in georeferenced soils across a subtropical savanna landscape experiencing woody encroachment to quantify their spatial patterns and elucidate drivers responsible for these patterns. We found divergent patterns of spatial heterogeneity of these elements in surface soils across this complex landscape. Nutrient accumulation and redistribution underneath woody canopies occurred in a subset of elements (i.e., N, P, S, Ca, Cu, and Sr). Though some of these elements are not necessarily growth-limiting, they do occur in higher concentrations in woody compared to herbaceous plants. Distributions of the other elements were closely related to spatial variation in soil pH, clay content, and slope rather than to woody encroachment. Our nuanced spatial sampling approach and analysis reveal significant variation in nutrient distributions in response to woody encroachment, and illustrate the role of landscape patterns in mediating ecosystem processes. These changes in the concentrations and distributions of key essential nutrients broaden our understanding of the biogeochemical consequences of woody encroachment, and provide new insights regarding the significance of long-term vegetation dynamics in dryland ecosystems.

Starting points for the restoration of desertified drylands: <i>puesteros</i>' cultural values in the use of native flora	ECOSYSTEMS AND PEOPLE												In rural dryland areas, the socioeconomic diagnosis of the population and their traditional knowledge of the flora are key to restoration. In this study, we asked rural people (locally called "puesteros") about their knowledge of the native flora, in a settlement of 160 inhabitants, located in drylands of Argentine. For this, semi-structured surveys and open interviews were carried out with 30 puesteros. The surveys collected information about the puesteros' socio-economic characteristics, their knowledge and value about the use of species, and their interest in planting those species in their farms. Once the list of multipurpose species was obtained, we reviewed the scientific literature to know some of their favorable ecological attributes. The interviews were carried out to know the limitations and advantages associated with planting native species in the puesteros' home gardens. Our results show that 33% of the people surveyed were illiterate, and their primary economic source of income was livestock. In the surveys, the puesteros mentioned 44 multipurpose species, which were classified by their uses. 97% of respondents expressed interest in planting on their farms and mentioned 21 potentially useful species. Of the 44 multipurpose species mentioned by the puesteros, we found that 22 had ecological attributes for restoration. In the interviews, the puesteros identified the factors that limited and favored plantations. They had already planted 44 species in their home gardens for different purposes. The implications of current local knowledge for future socio-ecological approaches to productive restoration in drylands are discussed.

Long-term landscape processes that shape valleys and focus the movement of water and sediment are accountable for providing a suitable template with which hydrology interacts to allow wetland formation. Current hydrogeomorphic classification systems do not address system-scale linkages of sediment and water transport across the landscape, and are therefore unable to contextualise long-term process dynamics. Misunderstanding long-term earth system processes can result in the application of inappropriate restoration strategies that isolate wetlands from longitudinal drivers of their formation. We propose a genetic classification system that focuses on the mode of wetland formation, and is based on the understanding that genetic processes impact on the outcome hydrology, sedimentology, geomorphology, ecosystem service provision, and long-term dynamics of wetlands in drylands. The classification aims to impart understanding of dynamic processes of sediment transport through wetlands, such that restoration plans can be sensitive to long-term landscape processes. The classification system, derived from a combination of international literature and published South African case studies, has four wetland macrotypes based on sediment source (colluvial, alluvial, Aeolian, and geochemical). These are subdivided into eight wetland types; hillslope seep, floodplain, valley-bottom, plain, blocked-valley, alluvial fan, aeolian depression, and geochemical depression. The classification is based on landscape location, shape, and the occurrence of geomorphic characteristics indicative of process.

Probable rainfall for the municipality of Afranio-PE at different probabilistic levels	SIGMAE												The municipality of Afranio is located in the mesoregion of the Sao Francisco River, inserted in the drought polygon is therefore marked by intense irregularity of rains. In spite of this, it presents an extensive area where the dryland agriculture is carried out. In this context, the scarcity of water resources may have a strong bearing on socioeconomic development. Therefore, estimates of rainfall occurrence with a certain level of probability becomes of great importance for agricultural planning because it allows determination of the time most propitious to sowing. The aim of this work was to determine the expected rainfall at different levels of probability for the municipality of Afranio-PE, aiming to define a better time for rainfed planting and the more favorable season for lowering the Caatinga woody plants, aiming at the pastoral management of ovine and caprine animals raised extensively in the region. The study was carried out with monthly rainfall data of a 63-year series for the city of Afranio. Estimates of probable monthly rainfall were obtained for the levels of 90, 80, 75, 60, 50, 45, 40, 35 and 30% probability, using the Gamma probability distribution function. It was verified that the rainy season begins in November and may extend until April. The best time for the rainy season in the municipality of Afranio-PE is the February-March bimester, due to the lower probability of occurrence of dry periods and greater possibility of consecutive rainy periods.

Prediction of summer rainfall would be valuable for managing the region's water resources and agricultural operations. This study investigated the influence of sea surface temperature (SST) as a predictor of summer rainfall in the basin by applying cross-correlation analysis between summer rainfall and climatic indices and SST in various oceanic regions from 1985 to 2015. Summer rainfall showed a strong negative correlation (-0.619) with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index at short time lags. Further analysis identified strong teleconnections (|r|>= 0.5) between SSTs in specific parts of the Pacific Ocean and summer rainfall in the Lake Tana basin, raising the possibility of predicting summer rainfall from Pacific SSTs with a lead time of 4 to 5months. Average SSTs of an area near the Philippines and an area west of North America were positively correlated (0.629) and negatively correlated (-0.538), respectively, with summer rainfall in the Lake Tana basin. Predictions of summer rainfall from these teleconnected SSTs by an Elman recurrent neural network model were encouraging, indicating a strong correlation (r>0.77) between the observed and predicted summer rainfall. Our results suggest that neural network techniques may have sufficient skill to support seasonal rainfall predictions over the Lake Tana basin.

We researched the dynamic feature of soil organic carbon (SOC) and its components at different growth stages of winter wheat under different mulching methods, including microbial biomass carbon (MBC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), mineralizable carbon (PCM) and easily oxidized carbon (EOC). The results showed that SOC and its components in different soil layers decreased with an increase of soil layer depth. Compared with CK, the SM treatment increased SOC in the 0-40 cm soil layer by 2.83-8.92%, MBC by 12.09-18.40%, DOC by 3.73-9.79%, PCM by 4.82-12.48% and EOC by 6.01-11.68% during the different periods, and an overall increase was greater in the 0-20 cm soil layer than in the 20-40 cm soil layer. The impact of PM on SOC was less significant compared with CK; MBC and PCM had an overall positive effect, and DOC and EOC behaved differently from year to year. In conclusion, SM can improve SOC and its components content in dryland of northwest China, which is conducive to the sustainable management and efficient utilization of maize straw resources and has significant ecological benefits.																				2073-4441				SEP	2022	14	17							2645	10.3390/w14172645	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14172645													WOS:000851867700001
J	Tsiboe, F; Tack, J				Tsiboe, Francis; Tack, Jesse			Utilizing Topographic and Soil Features to Improve Rating for Farm-Level Insurance ProductsJEL codes	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS												Previous studies have shown a strong correlation between topographic/soil features and agricultural production; however, linkages between these features and agricultural insurance products are scarce. Agricultural insurance is an ever-growing means of governmental support for producers globally. However, failure to set insurance premiums that accurately reflect risk exposure can lead to low participation rates and/or adverse selection. The U.S. federal crop insurance program partly guards against this at the farm level by inducing pricing heterogeneity via a rate multiplier curve, which does not consider topographic/soil information. We develop a method for econometrically incorporating this information into existing rating procedures used by the Risk Management Agency (RMA). The empirical application leverages 149,267 farm-level observations of Kansas producers across four dryland crops (corn, soybean, sorghum, and wheat), spanning forty-six years, and matched to fine-scale topographic/soil features. The results suggest that incorporating these features does improve the prediction accuracy of yield losses and can, in general, improve rating performance. However, these improvements are specific to farms with limited yield histories, as there are no improvements for farms with the commonly used yield history of ten years. This suggests substantial rating improvements for new farms or those with limited histories for a particular crop, but more general improvements for the program are not likely to occur given a large number of current participants with a full ten-year yield history.

J	Zhang, ZQ; Zhang, J; Jiao, S				Zhang, Zhengqing; Zhang, Jie; Jiao, Shuo			Fungi show broader environmental thresholds in wet than dry agricultural soils with distinct biogeographic patterns	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												It is critical to establish response thresholds for fungal communities to global environmental change and assess the relationship between fungal diversity and nutrient cycling in soils. However, these have not yet been evaluated in agro-ecosystems. Here we report the findings of a survey across eastern China on the soil fungi and physicochemical properties in adjacent maize and rice fields. The results revealed a wider range of environmental thresholds for soil fungi in rice than maize fields. We found that the dominant fungal taxa only accounted for 0.6% of all taxa, but constituted >50% of total fungi. Based on their habitat preferences, distinct distribution maps between maize and rice fields were constructed, which indicated niche differentiation of soil fungi between dry and waterlogged soils. Rice fields showed higher fungal richness in low latitude regions, consistent with latitudinal richness patterns found in natural terrestrial ecosystems; however, no such trend was observed in maize fields. Fungal richness was positively correlated with nutrient cycling in rice soils and fungal beta diversity with nutrient cycling in maize soils. These findings provide response thresholds for fungal community change across environmental gradients, advancing our understanding of soil fungal diversity patterns in agricultural ecosystems. Differences between wetland and dryland should be taken into consideration when formulating sustainable management plans and baselines for assessments of future global change and resilience of agricultural fields.

The reason is a lack of evidence supporting the importance of biodiversity on spatial scales at which climate models are built. Here, we test the hypothesis that diversity enhances productivity stability at a large scale. Location South American dryland known as Caatinga (similar to 830,000 km(2)). Time period 2001-2010. Major taxa studied Woody plants. Methods We used the enhanced vegetation index of Caatinga vegetation remnants, from 2001 to 2010, to calculate vegetation productivity stability across years. We used occurrence records of 606 woody species from floristic surveys to derive species richness and phylogenetic diversity at similar to 5 km and similar to 55 km (0.5 degrees) resolution. Climate data were obtained from global databases. Results Plant phylogenetic diversity has a strong positive correlation with productivity stability even after controlling for several climatic variables, such as rainfall, temperature and cloudiness, at both resolutions. Species richness was not significant when climatic variables were included. Main conclusions This result expands by several orders of magnitude the spatial scale of the evidence that biodiversity strengths the resilience of key ecosystem functions. We highlight that, by incorporating plant phylogenetic diversity, regional and global climate models can generate more accurate predictions about future ecosystem functioning and services that are critical to humankind.

However, few studies have evaluated the effects of zokors on soil erosion. In this study, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) was planted in tanks to quantify the effects of zokor excavation activities on runoff and soil erosion rate. Three slope gradients of 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 15 degrees were set, two soil tanks (with and without a zokor) were used for each gradient, and six soil tanks were prepared in total. Laboratory simulated rainfall was applied using a side-spray simulation system, and the rainfall intensity was set to 80 mm h(-1) with the rainfall duration of 60 min after runoff generation. Results showed that the soil bulk density of fresh zokor mounds was 0.82 +/- 0.02 g cm(-3), which was 39% lower than that of the soil matrix (1.35 g cm(-3)). The vegetation coverage decreased to 32%, 45%, and 43% respectively, after 3 days of disturbance by zokor, compared with 87%, 90%, and 92% in the tanks without zokor. The presence of zokor reduced the runoff rate by 88% on the lowest gradient to 21% on the steepest gradient, and increased the water infiltration and soil water storage within 90 cm depth. The soil mounds and herbivorous tunnel changed the microtopography and consequently the runoff pathway, increased the sediment yield, and intensified soil erosion, especially at a steep slope gradient. Although the activity of zokors does not directly increase soil erosion, and the tunnel system can facilitate water infiltration and lessen runoff, the mounds they create provide loose and erodible materials. The destruction of vegetation by zokors would facilitate soil erosion and reduce the benefit of vegetation restoration. This study provides insights into the effects of subterranean rodents on soil erosion in the Loess Plateau.

An Improved Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Based Protocol Using Seeds for Detection of Five Major Peanut Allergens Ara h 1, Ara h 2, Ara h 3, Ara h 6, and Ara h 8	FRONTIERS IN NUTRITION												Peanut allergy is an important health concern among many individuals. As there is no effective treatment to peanut allergy, continuous monitoring of peanut-based products, and their sources is essential. Precise detection of peanut allergens is key for identification and development of improved peanut varieties with minimum or no allergens in addition to estimating the levels in peanut-based products available in food chain. The antibody based ELISA protocol along with sample preparation was standardized for Ara h 1, Ara h 2, Ara h 3, Ara h 6, and Ara h 8 to estimate their quantities in peanut seeds. Three different dilutions were optimized to precisely quantify target allergen proteins in peanut seeds such as Ara h 1 (1/1,000, 1/2,000, and 1/4,000), Ara h 2 and Ara h 3 (1/5,000, 1/10,000, and 1/20,000), Ara h 6 (1/40,000, 1/80,000, and 1/1,60,000), and Ara h 8 (1/10, 1/20, and 1/40). These dilutions were finalized for each allergen based on the accuracy of detection by achieving <20% coefficient of variation in three technical replicates. This protocol captured wide variation of allergen proteins in selected peanut genotypes for Ara h 1 (77-46,106 mu g/g), Ara h 2 (265-5,426 mu g/g), Ara h 3 (382-12,676 mu g/g), Ara h 6 (949-43,375 mu g/g), and Ara h 8 (0.385-6 mu g/g). The assay is sensitive and reliable in precise detection of five major peanut allergens in seeds. Deployment of such protocol allows screening of large scale germplasm and breeding lines while developing peanut varieties with minimum allergenicity to ensure food safety.

Automated Inundation Mapping Over Large Areas Using Landsat Data and Google Earth Engine	REMOTE SENSING												Accurate inundation maps for flooded wetlands and rivers are a critical resource for their management and conservation. In this paper, we automate a method (thresholding of the short-wave infrared band) for classifying peak inundation in the Okavango Delta, northern Botswana, using Landsat imagery and Google Earth Engine. Inundation classification in the Okavango Delta is complex owing to the spectral overlap between inundated areas covered with aquatic vegetation and dryland vegetation classes on satellite imagery, and classifications have predominately been implemented on broad spatial resolution imagery. We present the longest time series to date (1990-2019) of inundation maps for the peak flood season at a high spatial resolution (30 m) for the Okavango Delta. We validated the maps using image-based and in situ data accuracy assessments, with overall accuracy ranging from 91.5% to 98.1%. Use of Landsat imagery resulted in consistently lower (on average, 692 km(2)) estimates of inundation extent than previous studies that used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (NOAA AVHRR) imagery, likely owing to the increased number of mixed pixels that occur when using broad spatial resolution imagery, which can lead to overestimations of the size of inundated areas. We provide the inundation maps and Google Earth Engine code for public use. This classification method can likely be adapted for inundation mapping in other regions.

Evaluation of morpho-physiological traits under drought stress conditions in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L.)	PHOTOSYNTHETICA												Drought stress is one of the major constraints limiting the production and productivity of barley. We tried to identify some indicators related to plant productivity by analyzing some agro-morphological and physiological traits in recombinant inbred lines (RILs). Plants were exposed to three water treatments: well-watered at 70% available water content (AWC), mild drought stress at 35% AWC, and severe drought stress at 10% AWC. Our results revealed that drought significantly affected most of the studied morpho-physiological traits resulting in strong decreases in yield and the studied traits. We did not observe a significant difference in water-use efficiency between severe and mild drought conditions. Therefore, the mild stress treatment was considered as the most suitable water level in our study. Genotypes with the most tillers and spikes, the highest 1,000-grain mass, and biological yields achieved higher grain yields under all water stress conditions. Therefore, these traits could be considered as useful tools in breeding programs.																			0300-3604	1573-9058					2020	58	4					1059	1067		10.32615/ps.2020.041	http://dx.doi.org/10.32615/ps.2020.041													WOS:000566667900018

PALAIOS												By colonizing drylands, plants fundamentally changed continental deposition and, thus, intensified the interaction between life and sediments. Fossil large woody debris in epiclastic strata is a key archive of this environmental turnover, although its interpretation remains challenging due to taphonomic biases. We review voluminous fluvial red-bed successions with sizeable silicified trunks that characterize Middle Pennsylvanian-lower Permian strata of east-central Europe. The stratigraphic occurrence, petrography, architecture of the deposits, and the preservation and nature of the fossil wood are discussed in the context of the tectono-climatic and vegetational evolution of the central-Pangean low latitudes. The log-bearing successions are assigned to five distinct, regionally traceable stratigraphic levels between the middle Moscovian and early Asselian. Up to 20 m long, mostly decorticated trunk fragments occur isolated in more or less feldspathic channel deposits, the architectures and dimensions of which point to large-scale river systems with highly variable discharge. Wood anatomy and floodplain adpression-fossils show that the trunks were derived from cordaitaleans, conifers, and arborescent sphenopsids in more diverse, gymnosperm-dominated dryland floras. The fossil record is biased towards successions formed in large-catchment river systems and, thus, does not accurately document the genuine nature of plant-distribution patterns. Rather, the strata show that large woody debris preservation depended on fluvial style and hydrological regime, hence turning the woody deposits into climate archives. The strata elucidate the climate development in equatorial Pangea, paralleling the acme of the Late Paleozoic Ice Age.

J	Yan, RH; Gao, JF				Yan, Renhua; Gao, Junfeng			Key factors affecting discharge, soil erosion, nitrogen and phosphorus exports from agricultural polder	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Quantifying the relative effect of driving factors on polder hydrological processes and identifying the key factors are prerequisites to adopting effective measures for alleviating flooding, soil loss, and eutrophication. Based on the output results of calibrated Polder Hydrology and Nitrogen modeling System (PHNS) and Polder Hydrology and Phosphorus modeling System (PHPS), the boosted regression tree (BRT) model screened key influential factors and identified the corresponding threshold point values in a typical Chinese agricultural polder. Temporal changes in discharge and soil erosion were most sensitive to weather factors, while those of nitrogen and phosphorus exports were mainly influenced by human management actions. Precipitation was the largest contributor to the temporal variation of discharge (51.5%), soil erosion (69.4%). Vegetation cover and management factor of dryland C2 (34.5%) defined as the ratio of sediment loss from cropland to the corresponding loss from clean-tilled and continuous fallow, and phosphorus fertilization application to paddy field (30.7%) were the two determinants of phosphorus export, whilst surface water level to stop pump drainage (48.2%) had the largest contributions to nitrogen export. Precipitation from 0 to 50 mm/d contributed to a significant increase in discharge, soil erosion and nitrogen and phosphorus exports. Vegetation cover and management factor of paddy field C1 under 0.28 contributed to an elevated risk of nitrogen export, and C2 below 0.34 facilitated soil loss and phosphorus export.

Decreased N-2 fixation during reproductive phases may constrain seed nitrogen concentrations ([N]), reducing protein concentration of grain legumes. Plants grown under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations ([CO2)) have greater water use efficiency. This may result in reduced use of conserved/ stored soil water, potentially helping to reduce soil water deficits later during grain filling. The extent that this process applies to drought sensitive grain legumes, which are extensively cultivated in Mediterranean environments is unclear. The objectives of this study were to investigate yield, N-2 fixation and seed N response of faba bean (Vicia faba L. cv. 'Fiesta') grown in a dryland Mediterranean-type environment under elevated [CO2]. Plants were grown in soil columns under ambient [COO ("400 ppm) or elevated [CO2] (e[CO2], (similar to)550 ppm) in a Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) facility in the field. One sub-group was continuously well-watered (80% field capacity, FC), whereas a second sub-group was exposed to a drought treatment (water was withheld until 30% FC was reached, which was then maintained during the reproductive phases). Biomass, gas exchange, C-13 isotopic discrimination, N-2 fixation by the natural abundance 13N method, nodulation and soil water content were assessed throughout the crop developmental stages. Initially, plants grown under elevated [CO2] depleted soil water more slowly in the drought treatment than those under ambient [CO2], but as plants grown under elevated [CO2] produced more biomass they used soil water more rapidly, especially towards the critical pod-filling phase. Water savings during the first phase of the drought treatment, through flowering up to the start of pod-filling, were associated with increased yield ( + 25%) and N-2 fixation (+15%) under drought. Elevated [CO2]-induced stimulation of nodulation and nodule density helped maintain N-2 fixation under drought, even though nodule activity decreased under the combined effect of e[CO2] and drought from pod-filling onwards. This later stage decrease was associated with decreased carbohydrate and increased amino acid concentrations in nodules, indicating a down-regulation of N-2 fixation. Associated with the decrease of N-2 fixation during pod-filling, seed N concentration was lower under the combination of e[CO2] and drought. We propose a conceptual model to explain the importance of N-2 fixation during the grain filling stage to maintain seed N concentration under e[CO2]. These findings suggest that e[CO2]induced savings in soil water may mitigate negative effects of drought on yield and N-2 fixation of faba bean, without fully compensating the effect of prolonged drought on seed N concentration.

J	Yang, K; Zhao, YG; Gao, LQ				Yang, Kai; Zhao, Yunge; Gao, Liqian			Biocrust succession improves soil aggregate stability of subsurface after "Grain for Green" Project in the Hilly Loess Plateau, China	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Soil aggregate stability is often used as the key indicate to evaluate soil degradation or soil erodibility. Numerous studies have indicated that biological soil crusts (biocrusts) can stabilise the soil surface by increasing the aggregate stability. In the end of the 20th century, the "Grain for Green" ecological project was implemented in most areas of the Loess Plateau, leading to the widespread distribution and succession of biocrusts in the open spaces between vascular plants in the abandoned farmlands. However, the effects of biocrust succession on the soil aggregate stability of subsurface remain poorly explored. Thus, to determine how biocrust succession affect subsurface soil aggregate stability, we investigated a cropland and 5 abandoned farmlands sites that have developed over three to 30 years in the Loess Plateau region of China. Then we measured the amounts of water stable aggregates of subsurface soil underlying different successional stage biocrusts (bare soil, cyanobacterial crust, cyanobacteria-moss mixed crust, and moss crust) by using wet-sieving method, and summed the mass fraction of soil remaining on each sieve after sieving multiplied by the mean aperture of the adjacent mesh (mean weight diameter) to characterise the soil aggregate stability. In addition, we analysed the complex correlations among age of farmland abandonment, biocrust succession, soil organic matter, clay fraction, and aggregate stability using structural equation modelling (SEM). The results are as follows: (1) the mean weight diameter (MWD) in the subsurface soil increased with the biocrust succession. The MWD in the 0-2-cm soil layer beneath moss crusts was 2.33 mm, 7.3 times as much as that of cropland sites. (2) The later successional stage biocrusts (mixed crust and moss crust) improved the deeper soil aggreggate stability compared with the early successional stage biocrusts. The MWD in 0-2-cm layer of the cyanobacterial crust was significantly higher than those of the lower layers, while MWDs in 0-2-cm and 0-5-cm layers of the later successional stage biocrust were significantly higher than that of 5-10-cm layer. (3) The SEM results confirmed that in the 0-5-cm layer, biocrust succession indirectly improved the stability of aggregates by increasing soil organic matter (SOM). There was a highly significant linear relationship between MWD of 0-5-cm layer and biocrust succession parameter (moss biomass) (R-2 = 0.35, P = 0.002). In the 5-10-cm layer, the SOM still significantly influenced the aggregate stability, but the biocrusts had no significant effect on the SOM in this layer. The results suggest that biocrusts should be considered a crucial factor in soil stability and be used as an effective rehabilitative tool for restoring lands in dryland regions.																			0167-1987	1879-3444				MAR	2022	217								105290	10.1016/j.still.2021.105290	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2021.105290													WOS:000817092300016
J	Wang, CX; Liu, YX; Zhang, YS				Wang, Chenxu; Liu, Yanxu; Zhang, Yaosheng			Identification of potential forest thinning locations to mitigate water deficits in drylands	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Appropriate forest thinning measures can mitigate the conflicting relationship between past excessive afforestation and current increasing regional water deficiency in dryland ecosystems. However, since blind intervention in forest landscapes may incur additional economic costs and cause the loss of ecosystem services, forest thinning in drylands mostly exists in scientific discussions and is seldom implemented in reality. In this study, we propose an advanced technical route to predict the spatial arrangement of potential forest thinning locations under different policy scenarios. Taking Shanxi Province in China as a case study, we simulated eight policy scenarios for different stakeholders to assess the benefits and costs after forest thinning in the future. The results show that a water deficit of 533 million m3 exists in Shanxi Province that could potentially be mitigated by means of forest thinning. Under different policy scenarios, the thinned area ranged from 1142.91 to 1195.47 km2, which would result in an additional soil loss of 1.77-3.02 million m3/year and a loss of carbon sequestration of 3.15-3.24 million t/year. Considering both soil conservation and food security scenarios can help minimize the direct costs and loss of forest carbon sequestration capacity and maintain a sustainable landscape pattern. The method can be used as a decision support tool to identify the potential locations of forest thinning and resulting consequences under water scarcity conditions in drylands and to support stakeholders in making scientific adaptive forest landscape optimization decisions.

Although the relationships between microbial carbon or nitrogen and the BSC at different successional stages have been a source of great concern, there are few reports regarding the phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) cycles. In this study, we used a functional gene array (GeoChip 5.0) to analyze the characteristics of microbial communities and their functional genes involved in the P and S cycles along a chronosequence of BSC succession in the Tengger Desert, China. The results showed that the functional genes associated with polyphosphate degradation and sulfite reduction were the major components involved in the P and S cycles, respectively, and the intensities of the functional genes expression involved in the P and S cycles increased significantly in 61-year-old BSCs. Compared with the fungal and archaeal communities, the bacterial community was the major contributor to the P and S cycles, and Proteobacteria (mainly Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Betaproteobacteria) and Actinobacteria were the dominant phyla. A redundancy analysis showed that there was significant synergy between the improvement in soil properties (e.g., soil nutrient content) and the intensities of genes expression related to P and S cycles. These findings indicated that after 61 years, BSC significantly promoted the microbial metabolic potential for P and S cycling, which in turn promoted soil rehabilitation in a desertified dryland.					liu, yubing/HMD-7696-2023; Zhang, Xiaofeng/JMC-6060-2023; Liu, Yubing/AFR-0289-2022	Zhang, Xiaofeng/0000-0003-2738-3286; Liu, Yubing/0000-0002-2338-097X													0929-1393	1873-0272				SEP	2021	165								104022	10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.104022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.104022		APR 2021											WOS:000657601200007

The two proxies were calibrated for both global and local modern data sets (NMSDB). This multi-proxy approach was then applied to a sediment core collected from Lake Ayrag, Arkhangai, covering the Late Holocene. In addition to brGDGTs and pollen, we also performed magnetic susceptibility, micro-XRF, elemental and isotopic bulk chemistry, and Non-Pollen Palynomorph (NPP) analyses on the Lake Ayrag sediments in order to better understand the lake system and human impact dynamics. While the globally calibrated record (both for pollen and brGDGTs) displayed a slight millennial-scale cooling, the locally calibrated results exhibit centennial-scale climate oscillations such as the 4.2 and 3.5 kyr events, the Roman Warm Period (RWP), Dark Ages Cold Period (DACP), Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and Little Ice Age (LIA). These climate oscillations and vegetation changes are discussed with regard to the main Mongolian human historical occupation events documented by pastoralism proxies, especially the Xiongnu, Mongol Empire, Mandchou and Soviet periods. The climate systems currently dominating the Mongolian Plateau are difficult to resolve because inter-annual climate variability is pronounced. However, precipitation mainly occurs in summer (easterly monsoon driven) when the winter Westerlies lead the air mass movement. In the past, both pollen and biomarkers exhibited anti-correlated trends with annual precipitation and temperature: over the last 4000 kcal yr BP, the warm periods (MWP, RWP) were dry and the cold periods (LIA, DACP, 3.5 kyrs) were humid. Thus, the East Asian Summer Monsoon (i.e., warm and wet conditions dominant during summer) seems not to have influenced central Mongolian climate during the Late Holocene, which could have remained dominated by the Westerlies/Siberian High cells conflict. A comparison between the Ayrag record and other paleoclimate records from the Baikal area (Dulikha), Mongolian Plateau (D3L6, D1L1, NRX, ATM), and continental China (Kesang, Baluk and Tonnel caves, XRD section) to the Loess Plateau (Huangye and Xianglong caves) suggests that the monsoon front has oscillated since the Early Holocene. A climate synthesis following strictly the same approach (locally calibrated brGDGTs vs. pollen-inferred climate) for all the ACA records available for the Late Holocene helps us to resolve the climate systems paced by centennial to millennial-scale oscillations and their consequences for human societies.

Ecological drought, emphasizing the process of drought impacts on ecosystems in coupled human-natural systems, has been posing large risks to the stability of groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) in drylands. Yet, the interconnected avenues via which ecological drought drives vegetation transition, ecological resilience and ecosystem services in GDEs with species-specific traits remain elusive, especially in arid endorheic basins. Here, we combine comprehensive field measurements derived from representative groundwater depth transects in Central Asia and simulations obtained from the stochastic eco-hydrological models and the Langevin approach, we find that two groundwater-dependent species, the salt-tolerant Haloxylon ammodendron and salt-sensitive Haloxylon persicum, exhibit contrasting water use strategies being driven by variations in eco-physiological traits and environmental regimes. Nonetheless, both the low-resilient H. ammodendron and high-resilient H. persicum vegetation tend to show bistable transition corresponding to vegetated and bare soils under drought stress with stochastic noises and time delays. Alarmingly, ecological drought is accelerating catastrophic transitions in both Haloxylon ecosystems induced by diminishing ecological flows, depleting soil moisture, and aggravating salinization, together with climate forcing. In particular, exacerbated drought stress reduces ecological resilience, enhances the likelihood of catastrophic shifts, and reduces ecosystem services of GDEs in arid endorheic basins. Our results highlight that ecological drought adaptation strategies must account for resilience maintenance by balancing water scarcity, water overuse, and water/soil quality to avoid accelerating regime shifts in dryland ecosystems.

Previous studies highlighted large uncertainties in GPP datasets based on satellite data with coarse spatial resolutions (>500 m), and implied the need to produce high-spatial-resolution datasets. However, estimating fine spatial resolution GPP is time-consuming and requires an enormous amount of computing storage space. In this study, based on the Eddy Covariance-Light Use Efficiency (EC-LUE) model, we used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to develop a web application (EC-LUE APP) to generate 30-m-spatial-resolution GPP estimates within a region of interest. We examined the accuracy of the GPP estimates produced by the APP and compared them with observed GPP at 193 global eddy covariance sites. The results showed the good performance of the EC-LUE APP in reproducing the spatial and temporal variations in the GPP. The fine-spatial-resolution GPP product (GPP(L)) explained 64% of the GPP variations and had fewer uncertainties (root mean square error = 2.34 g C m(-2) d(-1)) and bias (-0.09 g C m(-2) d(-1)) than the coarse-spatial-resolution GPP products. In particular, the GPP(L) significantly improved the GPP estimations for cropland and dryland ecosystems. With this APP, users can easily obtain 30-m-spatial-resolution GPP at any given location and for any given year since 1984.

It is important to explore the microbial communities in these foods to improve their quality and organoleptic properties. In this study, the bacterial and fungal communities of two popular sorghum-based fermented foods in Sudan (kisra and hulumur) were analyzed, for the first time, using a culture-independent method of next-generation sequencing. Methods Fermented doughs for kisra and hulumur production were prepared according to the traditional approach, and then the bacterial and fungal communities were investigated using high-throughput sequencing. Results Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla were the predominant bacteria in both fermented doughs. At the genus level, the bacterial community was dominated by lactic acid bacteria, primarilyLactobacillusandPediococcus, which represented 95.7% and 72% of the bacterial population in kisra and hulumur, respectively. Next, acetic acid bacteria (GluconobacterandAcetobacter) were subdominant in hulumur. The fungal community was more heterogeneous among the fermented doughs. Zygomycota (85.5%) comprised the major phylum in kisra fermented dough, whereas Ascomycota (99.5%) was predominant in hulumur. The major fungal genera,Rhizopus,Alternaria,Penicillium,Gibberella,Lasiodiplodia, andAspergillus, were extremely varied between the fermented doughs. Conclusion Exploration of kisra and hulumur microbial community structure will expand the knowledge about their microbiota to manipulate the microbial community and improve their quality and organoleptic properties using different microbial recipes.					taniguchi, takeshi/AAG-5450-2021; Eltayeb, Mohamed/AFX-4167-2022	taniguchi, takeshi/0000-0001-7386-1117; Eltigani, Sara A./0000-0001-5418-4894; Eltayeb, Mohamed M./0000-0001-7178-2271													1590-4261	1869-2044				SEP 4	2020	70	1							53	10.1186/s13213-020-01595-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13213-020-01595-4													WOS:000565878700001
J	Baker, BD; Lapierre, SS; Tanaka, H				Baker, Brett D.; Lapierre, Stephanie S.; Tanaka, Hirofumi			Role of Cross-training in Orthopaedic Injuries and Healthcare Burden in Masters Swimmers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE												We determined whether the incidence of injuries would increase with advancing age and whether the participation in cross-training would be related to a decreased rate of injuries and healthcare costs in Masters swimmers. A total of 499 swimmers (55 +/- 14 years of age) belonging to US Masters Swimming completed a comprehensive questionnaire that included questions regarding their medical history as well as their training history. In average, swimmers had been training for 13 +/- 12 years, and 35, 40, and 47% participated in running, cycling, and dryland resistance training, respectively. According to the logistic regression, prevalence of injuries increased significantly but modestly with advancing age (p<0.05). Linear regression analysis showed that for every 1 month increase in the length of injury, healthcare costs increased by 7.4% (p<0.05). Linear regression and logistic regression analyses determined that overall volume of swimming training was not related to age or incidence of injuries, respectively. Multinomial logistic regression analyses using age and sex as predictors demonstrated that the odds of reporting a swim-related injury were significantly lower for individuals who participated in any number of cross-training activities compared with those who do not cross-train (p<0.05). Regular participation in any cross-training modality was inversely related to age (p<0.05).

It is interesting to find that the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from strain YJ15 exhibited significant antifungal activity against Botrytis cinerea as well as 11 other plant-pathogenic fungi, with a percentage of mycelial growth inhibition from 74.96 to 92.81%. Additionally, VOCs from strain YJ15 could reduce significantly the disease incidence and lesion diameter with the increasing of fermentation time, indicating great biocontrol potential for controlling blueberry postharvest gray mold. Furthermore, the VOCs were collected by using headspace solid-phase microextraction fiber, and the composition of VOCs was further revealed by using gas chromatography coupled with quadruple mass spectrometry. In total, 24 kinds of VOCs, including 5 alkanes, 2 aldehydes, 3 ketones, 5 alcohols, 1 alkene, 5 acids and esters, 2 aromatic compounds, and 1 sulfur compound, were emitted at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after inoculation. Among these VOCs, eight antifungal VOCs could inhibit mycelial growth of B. cinerea. It is important to highlight that, although 1-butanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol were the most abundant compounds, 2-ethylhexanol, 1-heptanol, and 1,3-xylene have proved to be more toxic to B. cinerea than 3-methyl-1-butanol, propanethioic acid, 2,2-dimethyl-, ethyl 2-methylbutyrate, 2-heptanone, and 1-butanol, which provide new, promising biofumigants for the control of postharvest gray mold caused by B. cinerea.

Salient Findings on Host Range, Resistance Screening, and Molecular Studies on Sterility Mosaic Disease of Pigeonpea Induced by <i>Pigeonpea sterility mosaic viruses </i>(<i>PPSMV</i>-<i>I </i>and <i>PPSMV</i>-<i>II</i>)	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Two distinct emaraviruses, Pigeonpea sterility mosaic virus-I (PPSMV-I) and Pigeonpea sterility mosaic virus-II (PPSMV-II) were found to be associated with sterility mosaic disease (SMD) of pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.]. The host range of both these viruses and their vector are narrow, confined to Nicotiana benthamiana identified through mechanical transmission, and to Phaseolus vulgaris cvs. Top Crop, Kintoki, and Bountiful (F: Fabaceae) through mite transmission. A weed host Chrozophora rottleri (F: Euphorbiaceae) was also infected and tested positive for both the viruses in RT-PCR. Among the wild Cajanus species tested, Cajanus platycarpus accessions , , and , and Cajanus scarabaeoides accessions , , and were infected by both the viruses and mite vector suggesting possible sources of SMD inoculum. Though accession of C. platycarpus, 15696 of C. scarabaeoides, and 15639 of Cajanus lanceolatus were infected by both the viruses, no mite infestation was observed on them. Phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences of RNA-1 and RNA-2 of PPSMV-I and PPSMV-II isolates in southern India revealed significant divergence especially PPSMV-II, which is closely related to the Fig mosaic virus (FMV) than PPSMV-I. In multilocation testing of pigeonpea genotypes for their broad-based resistance to SMD for two consecutive years, genotypes ICPL-16086 and ICPL-16087 showed resistance reaction (< 10% incidence) in all three locations studied. Overall, the present study gives a clear idea about the host range of PPSMV-I and PPSMV-II, their molecular relationship, and sources of resistance. This information is critical for the development of reliable diagnostic tools and improved disease management strategies.					jayalalitha, k/GSD-6123-2022; Sharma, Mamta/GSN-5871-2022	B.

To investigate the effects of stepwise wetting and constant SM on the soil microbial community and respiration rates, eroded soil under afforestation on the Loess Plateau was examined. The soils were sampled and incubated with constant gravimetric SM of 5 %, 30 % and 45 % and wetting treatments with SM increasing from 5 % to 30 % (5-30 %), from 5 % to 30 % to 45 % (5-30-45 %) and from 30 % to 45 % (30-45 %). As shown in the results, bacterial richness and Shannon diversity were lower in the wetting treatments of 5-30 % and 5-30-45 % than those in 5 %, 30 % and 45 % SM constant treatments. Contrary, the values were similar in the 30 % SM constant and the 30-45 % SM wetting treatment, which were the highest among all the treatments. The dominant bacterial species converted from Actinobacteria to Alphaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria with SM increasing. No significant differences were observed in fungal Shannon diversity, richness and communities under varying conditions. Consequently, the wetting treatments influenced the bacteria more significantly than fungi. A greater Birch effect occurred with a two-step increase in SM (i.e., 5-30-45 %) than the one-step wetting treatment (i.e., 30-45 %), while a dampened Birch effect was observed with higher previous soil respiration. However, excessive moisture did not enhance or even inhibit microbial respiration. Our work indicated that even short-term changes in the antecedent SM can significantly affect bacterial communities and dynamic of carbon flux. The responses of microbe and respiration were not only dependent on the current SM but also related to the antecedent SM condition. This study benefits plant-soil-water relationship management during afforestation on the Loess Plateau of China.

J	Cheng, TL; Wang, XP				Cheng, Tian-liang; Wang, Xin-ping			Shrub-soil interaction and its feedbacks to vegetation patterns in Alxa plateau in NW China	PLANT AND SOIL												AimsInteractions among plants are the main biotic driver for the development of spatial vegetation patterns in dryland ecosystems. The modification of soil properties by perennial plants is an important mechanism. We aimed to examine how spatial vegetation patterns were affected by the local changes in soil physiochemical properties beneath shrubs in different communities. MethodsWe investigated 36 plots containing shrub vegetation on the Alxa Plateau, northwestern China. Patch sizes of all shrubs were measured. The median and curvature of patch size distribution (obtained by quadratic regression) were selected as indicators for spatial patterns. We determined soil physiochemical properties beneath the canopy of dominant and other shrub species and in adjacent intershrub spaces. A multi-model inference procedure was employed to analyze the standardized effect of the changes in soil properties and their interactions on the spatial vegetation patterns. ResultsLocal changes in soil physiochemical properties associated with shrub-soil feedbacks affected spatial vegetation patterns in different aspects. Salt aggregation was positively correlated with deviations from the power-law distribution, while nutrient concentration had no significant effect. Interaction between nutrient and salinity concentration positively affected the median patch size, maintaining a stable Turing-like pattern. Heterogeneity analysis showed that the dominant shrub species are representative of plant-soil interactions for the entire community. ConclusionsOur study suggests that soil salinity accumulated under the canopy of shrubs is the key soil property driving the spatial pattern of vegetation patches on the Alta Plateau.

Thirty pregnant doe Kacang goats aged 2-3 years were observed. The rearing system was semi-intensive without giving concentrated feeds. Local grasses and legumes such as Leucaena leucocephala leaves, Gliricidia sepium leaves, Sesbania grandiflora leaves, and drinking water were offered ad libitum. Experimental data such as respiration rate, rectal temperature, adaptability coefficient, heart rate, and heat tolerance coefficient, were collected during 2-3 months of gestation. The mean and standard deviation were calculated using a descriptive analysis method. The average humidity in the morning and afternoon and the ambient temperature in the middle of the day were outside the normal range. The THI value indicates that the experimental animals are under medium heat stress. The average values of HTC, AC, RT, HR, and RR were still typical for goats. In conclusion, although the average ambient temperature at midday and humidity in the morning and afternoon were outside of the normal range, they did not cause any effects on feed and water intake, health, and fetus growth and development of pregnant doe Kacang goats. This happened because the Kacang goat is a local breed that can adapt well to extreme environments. Therefore, pregnant doe Kacang goats in Malaka District can be allowed to graze in the paddock throughout the day and housed at night.

Knowledge of the hydraulic properties of biocrusts and parameterization of soil hydraulic properties are important to improve simulation of infiltration and soil water dynamics in vegetation-soil-water models. In this study, four treatments, including bare land with sporadic cyanobacterial biocrusts (BL), lichen-dominated biocrusts (LB), early-successional moss biocrusts (EMB), and latesuccessional moss biocrusts (LMB), were established to evaluate the effects of biocrust development on soil water infiltration in the Mu Us Desert, northwest of China. Moreover, a combined Wooding inverse approach was used for the estimation of soil hydraulic parameters. The results showed that infiltration rate followed the pattern BL > LB > EMB > LMB. Moreover, the LB, EMB, and LMB treatments had significantly lower infiltration rates than the BL treatment. The saturated soil moisture (theta s) and shape parameter (alpha VG) for the EMB and LMB treatments were higher than that for the BL and LB treatments, although the difference among four treatments was insignificant. Water retention increased with biocrust development at high-pressure heads, whereas the opposite was observed at low-pressure heads. The development of biocrusts influences van Genuchten parameters, subsequently affects the water retention curve, and thereby alters available water in the biocrust layer. The findings regarding the parameterization of soil hydraulic properties have important implications for the simulation of eco-hydrological processes in dryland ecosystems.																				1338-4333				DEC	2021	69	4					378	386		10.2478/johh-2021-0026	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/johh-2021-0026													WOS:000719814700004

This study evaluates the CFs, farm CFs (FCFs: CFs of per unit area), and production CFs (PCFs: CFs of per unit yield) of main grains production in China based on a new scale data set: agricultural statistics data of over 300 prefecture-level regions. A comparison of CFs of main grains production between main producing area (MPA) and non-main producing area (NMPA) are firstly discussed on a totally new scale. Results show that the CFs of main grains production of MPA accounts for 54-57% of country's total although the area of farmland of MPA only accounts for 42%. The PCF and FCF of rice production are higher in MPA, while those of wheat and maize production are lower in MPA. It implies that there are less GHG emission of rice (main paddy grain) productions in NMPA and less GHG emission of wheat and maize (main dryland grains) production in MPA. In additional, the PCF of rice shows growth, while that of wheat and maize shows decline from 2008 to 2017. The growth of PCF of rice is mainly driven by the rise of PCF in MPA. Findings are expected to improve the understanding patterns of China's CF of main grains production and subsequently contribute to GHG mitigation.

Although DSE exist in many non-mycorrhizal plants, the growing effects of DSE on non-mycorrhizal plants are currently poorly documented. This study investigated how DSE from mycorrhizal plants affect non-mycorrhizal plant growth especially under drought stress. In this study, the non-mycorrhizal plant Isatis indigotica was inoculated with DSE isolated from the roots of mycorrhizal plant Glycyrrhiza uralensis that grows in desert and farmland environments to evaluate plant performance and active ingredient content under different water treatments by measuring growth parameters and physiological indexes. The results indicated that seven DSE colonized the roots of I. indigotica regardless of watering regime. Inoculation with Acrocalymma vagum, Edenia gomezpompae and Darksidea alpha enhanced plant biomass, root surface area and epigoitrin content, and reduced oxidative damage from drought stress. Under drought stress condition, DSE inoculation caused remarkable increases in photosynthesis and revealed positive effects on SOD activity and proline content, which was reliance on fungus species. Correlation analyses indicated that root biomass was negatively correlated with soil pH and available phosphorus, and net photosynthetic rate was negatively correlated with soil organic carbon and available phosphorus. Therefore, DSE isolated from mycorrhizal plants could enhance the growth and active ingredient content of I. indigotica. The link between DSE and non-mycorrhizal plant highlights a potential application for DSE strains in dryland medicinal plant cultivation.

Assessments and perspectives on stem rust resistance in South African malting barley	AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY												The production of malting barley under dryland and irrigated environments in South Africa (SA) has increased recently, making it the second most important winter crop after wheat. To assess the potential vulnerability of adapted barleys from SA to wheat stem rust (caused byPuccinia graminisf. sp.tritici, Pgt, race PTKST) and rye stem rust (Puccinia graminisf. sp.secalis, Pgs, isolate UVPgs1), 50 accessions were evaluated as seedlings and as adult plants. The same barley germplasm was tested againstPgtandPgscultures from the USA that have proven useful for detecting the stem rust resistance genesRpg1and therpg4/Rpg5complex. The possible presence of these resistance genes was assayed using molecular markers and sequence analysis. Barley accessions exhibited mostly resistant infection types (ITs) to the South African cultures, whilst field data revealed that several of the barley varieties displayed high severities in combination with more compatible host response types to race PTKST. The barley accessions exhibited mostly high ITs to cultures from the USA. None of the seedling IT data was sufficiently distinct to reliably postulate the presence of possible resistance genes. This result was corroborated from the molecular assays forRpg1andrpg4/Rpg5. Except for one line that tested heterozygous for theRpg1gene, none of the test entries contained this gene or a functionalrpg4/Rpg5complex due to the prevalence of mutations in therpg4/Rpg5 + carriers. Susceptibility among barley varieties to wheat stem rust race PTKST under field conditions in the present study is of concern.

To fully exploit this biotechnology on a large scale in drylands, researchers must explore water-saving techniques to incubate biocrusts in situ. To achieve this aim, we tested three methods-broadcasting dried cyanobacteria, spraying fresh cyanobacteria, and broadcasting natural biocrust fragments-to culture biocrusts in situ on the Tengger Desert in Northern China. The cover of incubated biocrust increased during the first 2 months after inoculation (from 6% to more than 20.0% in treatments using biocrust fragments); biocrust cover declined but persisted after 12 months of incubation (13.8% cover in the best treatment, natural cyanobacteria fragments). The cover of cyanobacteria was higher than the cover of lichen in our natural cyanobacteria-lichen crust fragment treatment (NCL; p < .05) after incubating for 12 months. We highlight that cyanobacteria should be selected for biocrust incubation during the initial stages of dryland restoration. Accumulated rainfall was positively related to the cover of incubated biocrust. However, wind speed and wind erosion intensity were both negatively related to the cover of incubated biocrust. In conclusion, broadcasting biocrust fragments is a rapid, efficient, and water-saving biotechnique to cultivate biocrusts in situ. Actions to reduce wind speed and wind erosion, such as mechanical sand fixing, can help stabilize soils and improve crust cultivation.						zhao, yang/0000-0002-7860-9890													1085-3278	1099-145X				DEC	2019	30	18					2336	2346		10.1002/ldr.3423	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.3423		AUG 2019											WOS:000484596100001

Increased Dust Deposition in New Zealand Related to Twentieth Century Australian Land Use	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Mineral aerosols (dust) generated in the dryland regions of Australia have the potential to reach New Zealand through atmospheric transport. Although a large portion of dust in New Zealand originates in Australia, little is known about how dust deposition has varied over time in New Zealand or what may have caused this variation. We used geochemical dust proxies to examine the recent history of dust deposition to two alpine lakes in Kahurangi National Park, South Island, New Zealand. Geochemical indicators suggest that dust deposition began to increase around 1900, with the greatest deposition rates occurring from similar to 1920 to similar to 1990. In subsequent decades, dust deposition rates to New Zealand lakes appear to have declined. This rise and fall of dust deposition recorded in New Zealand lakes is consistent with dust records from the Antarctic Ice Sheet, Eastern Australia, and incidents of low visibility due to dust events recorded at Australian climate stations. The dust deposition rate over time also follows the temporal pattern of land use in south and central Australia over the time scale of the twentieth century suggesting a causal linkage. It is possible, and perhaps likely, that drought cycles also affected both emissions and transport pathways but over shorter time periods this was difficult to discern at the temporal resolution of these lake sediment cores. The increase in dust deposition to the high-elevation regions of New Zealand likely has implications for the biogeochemistry of alpine lakes in the Tasman Mountains.

Results showed that grass functional group constituted the vast majority of the aboveground vegetation and belowground bud bank in all treatments. Long-term grazing exclusion significantly increased total aboveground biomass (2.5 and 2.6 times in 20y and 30y grazing exclusion grasslands, respectively), and decreased total stem density (31% and 37% in 20y and 30y grazing exclusion grasslands, respectively). Grazing exclusion for 20 and 30 years increased grass aboveground biomass respectively by 6.0 and 8.0 times, and decreased grass stem density by 38% and 33%. Grazing exclusion had different effects on belowground bud density of grass and forb functional group. Long-term grazing exclusion significantly increased plant buds and bud bank size (25% and 37% in 20y and 30y grazing exclusion grasslands, respectively), especially for grass functional group (49% and 95% in 20y and 30y grazing exclusion grasslands, respectively), but had no significant effects on forb bud density. Changes of aboveground community were significantly related to changes of belowground bud bank under both grazing and grazing exclusion grasslands. The bud bank density of grass functional group was significantly positive with total (R-2 = 0.33, P < 0.05) and grass aboveground biomass (R-2 = 0.36, P < 0.01), while negative related with total (R-2 = -0.27, P < 0.05) and grass stem density (R-2 = -0.22, P < 0.05). Grazed grasslands, 20y and 30y grazing exclusion grasslands all were not meristem limited and had large reserve bud banks, which would completely replace the aboveground stem population during the growing season. These findings indicate that grazing exclusion could not only improve a large bud bank for grassland restoration but also improve the dominance of grass functional group by increasing grass belowground bud banks in typical steppe community.

Impacts of Root-Lesion Nematode (<i>Pratylenchus</i> <i>thornei</i>) on Plant Nutrition, Biomass, Grain Yield and Yield Components of Susceptible/Intolerant Wheat Cultivars Determined by Nematicide Applications	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Field experiments testing rates of various nematicides, with and without NPZn fertiliser, were analysed to investigate how root-lesion nematode (Pratylenchus thornei) affects growth and yield components of susceptible/intolerant wheat cultivars in a subtropical environment. Plant response to nematode attack was assessed by regression and principal components analyses of various plant parameters at different crop development stages, in relation to different nematode population densities in the roots and root-zone soil. Reduction in P. thornei population densities by nematicides resulted in increased numbers of tillers, plant biomass, N and P concentrations and uptakes, numbers of spikes and kernels, and grain yield. Grain yield was strongly correlated with number of kernels, biomass and number of spikes, and negatively correlated with number of P. thornei in the root-zone soil at stem elongation. This study showed that P. thornei damage to roots decreased wheat yield through limiting N and P concentrations and uptakes in plant tops causing poor growth that commenced early and continued through the life of the crop. Genetic, environmental and management factors that reduce population densities of P. thornei, and decrease the impact of the nematodes starting in early crop growth, will greatly increase spike and kernel numbers and grain yield.

A delay in the onset of rainfall during autumn can inhibit hairy vetch seed germination, which exposes its early growth stages to low-temperature stress. The present study was carried out in a completely randomized design with four replications to evaluate the effects of seed priming on germination of hairy vetch under chilling stress. The treatments were seed-priming type (unprimed, hydro-priming, halo-priming, and osmopriming) and temperature (3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 degrees C). The results indicated that a decrease in temperature produced a linear decline in the germination rate of seeds treated with halo-priming and osmopriming (p < .01). The seedling length, seedling dry weight, and vigor index decreased in plants experiencing chilling stress (quadratic; p < .01) for hydro-priming, halo-priming, and osmopriming. The maximum germination rate was achieved using hydro-priming. Osmopriming prevented a decrease in the rate of germination at 3 degrees C. A decrease in temperature increased the proline and the soluble protein contents in all the seed priming treatments, but, decreased catalase and guaiacol peroxidase activity (p < .01). In brief, halo-priming, and hydro-priming enhanced establishment and growth of hairy vetch under chilling stress primarily through improvements in the physiological parameters and germination rate. This finding can increase the potential for cultivation of the hairy vetch in late planting date.

Cultivar-specific soil microbial communities with respect to their taxonomic structure and specific function have not been investigated explicitly in improving the adaptation of lentil cultivars under rice-fallow ecology. The present study was carried out to decipher the rhizosphere microbiome assembly of two lentil cultivars under rice-fallow ecology for discerning the diversity of microbial communities and for predicting the function of microbiome genes related to nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling processes deploying high-throughput whole (meta) genome sequencing. The metagenome profile of two cultivars detected variable microbiome composition with discrete metabolic activity. Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Thaumarchaeota were abundant phyla in the "Farmer-2" rhizosphere, whereas Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Planctomycetes, Chloroflexi, and some incompletely described procaryotes of the "Candidatus" category were found to be robustly enriched the rhizosphere of "Moitree". Functional prediction profiles of the microbial metagenomes between two cultivars revealed mostly house keeping genes with general metabolism. Additionally, the rhizosphere of "Moitree" had a high abundance of genes related to denitrification processes. Significant difference was observed regarding P cycling genes between the cultivars. "Moitree" with a profuse root system exhibited better N fixation and translocation ability due to a good "foraging strategy" for improving acquisition of native P under the nutrient depleted rice-fallow ecology. However, "Farmer-2" revealed a better "mining strategy" for enhancing P solubilization and further transportation to sinks. This study warrants comprehensive research for explaining the role of microbiome diversity and cultivar-microbe interactions towards stimulating microbiome-derived soil reactions regarding nutrient availability under rice-fallow ecology.

Ryan; Kallenbach, Robert L.; Yuan, Zhiyou			Diversity-stability relationships in temperate grasslands as a function of soil pH	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Diversity-stability relationships in grasslands depend on the environment. Climate change and land degradation potentially alter soil pH and community stability within grassland environments, although it remains unclear how alteration in soil pH affects diversity-stability relationships. From a three-year experiment with acidification and alkalization treatments in three types of grasslands (i.e., desert, typical and meadow grasslands) in Northern China, we found that altered soil pH negatively impacted community biodiversity, especially in desert grasslands. Both soil acidification and alkalization reduced community stability in desert grasslands. Soil alkalization reduced community stability in typical grasslands. Altered soil pH did not affect community stability in meadow grasslands. The reduced community stability by soil acidification in desert grasslands could be attributed to the decreased dominant species stability, whereas the soil alkalization-induced decline of community stability could be attributed to the reducing species asynchrony and dominant species stability. Our results suggest that soil pH-mediated community stability is mainly driven by dominant species stability rather than diversity in desert grassland. Soil nutrients are affected by soil acidification and alkalization and varied among grasslands. Soil acidification enhanced nutrient availability and soil alkalization reduced soil total nutrients, both of which were negatively correlated with soil pH in desert grassland. Such changes in soil nutrients were associated with species asynchrony and then indirectly affected community stability, indicating the importance of soil nutrients in driving community stability. Our study suggests that drier grasslands might face greater stability risks and challenges than wetter grasslands under altered soil pH across spatial gradients of semiarid grasslands.

Green manure has emerged as an appropriate practice to improve soil fertility and crop yield. However, the potential functions of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the below-ground ecosystems following the application of green manure in Ultisols remain largely unexplored. In this study, qPCR and high-throughput sequencing were used to investigate the response of AMF abundance and communities in different treatment groups, i.e., control (without fertilization), mineral fertilization (NPK), mineral fertilization with returning peanut straw (NPKS), and with green manure (hairy vetch; NPKG). The NPKG treatment significantly increased soil fertility compared to other treatment groups. Compared with control, the NPK, NPKS, and NPKG treatments increased peanut yield by 12.3, 13.1, and 25.4%, respectively. NPKS and NPKG treatments significantly altered the AMF community composition decreased the AMF diversity and increased AMF abundance compared to the control. The AMF network of the NPKG treatment group showed the highest complexity and stability compared to other treatment groups. The structural equation modeling revealed that the application of hairy vetch improved soil nutrients and peanut yield by increasing the soil AMF abundance and network stability. Overall, the results suggested that the application of hairy vetch might trigger positive feedback between the peanut and AMF community, contributing to fertility and yield improvement in the dryland of Ultisol.

However, the effects of various litter positions on litter decomposition rates and nutrient dynamics under nitrogen (N) enrichment in such areas remain unknown. Methods A field experiment was performed in the alpine grasslands of northwest China to investigate the influence of litter position (surface, buried in the soil and standing) and N enrichment on litter decomposition, using data from two dominant grass species (Festuca ovina and Leymus tianschanicus) in control and N-enriched plots. Important Findings Litter decomposition rates were much faster in buried litter and slower in standing litter than in surface litter. N enrichment significantly affected litter quality and then influenced decomposition. But no significant differences in litter mass remaining were observed between control and N-enriched soil burial. These results indicated that N enrichment significantly affected litter decomposition by changes in litter quality. In addition, all litter exhibited net carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) release regardless of treatments. Litter exhibited net N accumulation for litter from the control plots but showed N release for litter from N enrichment plots. These suggested that litter decomposition can be limited by N and N enrichment influenced N cycling of litter. Current study presented direct evidence that soil buried litter exhibited faster mass loss and C release, and that soil burial can be a candidate explanation why litter decomposes faster than expected in dryland.

In this study, we assessed the vegetation changes and ecosystem resilience in the Horn of Africa (HOA) since 2000 and detected their drivers based mainly on analysis of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. We found that the annual and seasonal trends of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) generally increased during the last two decades over the Horn of Africa particularly in western parts of Ethiopia and Kenya. The weakest annual and seasonal NDVI trends were observed over the grassland cover and tropical arid agroecological zones. The NDVI variation negatively correlated with Land Surface Temperature (LST) and positively correlated with precipitation at a significant level (p < 0.05) account for 683,197 km(2) and 533,385 km(2) area, respectively. The ecosystem Water Use Efficiency (eWUE) showed overall increasing trends with larger values for the grassland biome. The precipitation had the most significant effect on eWUE variation compared to LST and annual SPEI (Standardized Evapotranspiration Index). There were about 54.9% of HOA resilient to drought disturbance, whereas 32.6% was completely not-resilient. The ecosystems in the humid agroecological zones, the cropland, and wetland were slightly not-resilient to severe drought conditions in the region. This study provides useful information for policy makers regarding ecosystem and dryland management in the context of climate change at both national and regional levels.

J	Talhelm, T; English, AS				Talhelm, Thomas; English, Alexander S.			Historically rice-farming societies have tighter social norms in China and worldwide	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Data recently published in PNAS mapped out regional differences in the tightness of social norms across China [R. Y. J. Chua, K. G. Huang, M. Jin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 116, 6720-6725 (2019)]. Norms were tighter in developed, urbanized areas and weaker in rural areas. We tested whether historical paddy rice farming has left a legacy on social norms in modern China. Premodern rice farming could plausibly create strong social norms because paddy rice relied on irrigation networks. Rice farmers coordinated their water use and kept track of each person's labor contributions. Rice villages also established strong norms of reciprocity to cope with labor demands that were twice as high as dryland crops like wheat. In line with this theory, China's historically rice-farming areas had tighter social norms than wheat-farming areas, even beyond differences in development and urbanization. Rice-wheat differences were just as large among people in 10 neighboring provinces (n = 3,835) along the rice-wheat border. These neigh-boring provinces differ sharply in rice and wheat, but little in latitude, temperature, and other potential confounding variables. Outside of China, rice farming predicted norm tightness in 32 countries around the world. Finally, people in rice-farming areas scored lower on innovative thinking, which tends to be lower in societies with tight norms. This natural test case within China might explain why East Asia-historically reliant on rice farming- has tighter social norms than the wheat-farming West.

J	Jeanneau, AC; Ostendorf, B; Herrmann, T				Jeanneau, Amelie C.; Ostendorf, Bertram; Herrmann, Tim			Relative spatial differences in sediment transport in fire-affected agricultural landscapes: A field study	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												Fires can considerably increase wind erosion risk in dryland agricultural regions. While wind erosion post-fire has been extensively studied in rangeland and grazing landscapes, limited work has considered post-fire erosion on annual plant communities and annual crops. Here we evaluated the relative spatial differences in patterns of sediment transport between burnt and unburnt crop stubble sites. Following a severe wildfire, we studied the spatio-temporal pattern of aeolian sediment transport with an array of Modified Wilson and Cooke (MWAC) dust samplers on adjacent burnt and unburnt wheat stubble. Sediment collection was conducted during nine weeks over an area of 3 ha. Collection rates were converted to horizontal sediment flux to derive spatial distribution maps and perform statistical analysis. Compared to the unburnt plot, we observed that sediment transport was up to 1000 times higher within the burnt area. This could lead to damages to emerging annual crops sown after the fire if no management strategy was applied. There was only negligible sediment flux in areas with shallow and low-density stubble, which gradually increased with distance from the unburnt area. These results suggest that strips of remaining unburnt stubble could provide a potential benefit to adjacent burnt or bare plots. Patterns of sediment transport were consistent in all sampling periods and were observed at a spatial scale undetectable in wind tunnel studies, indicating that field observations could complement fine-scale experimental studies to assess environmental processes in real-life conditions.

However, this mode of pure plantation has triggered great concern over the soil ecosystem. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of the plantation on soil physiochemical properties, soil microorganisms, and the relationship between them in Robinia pseudoacacia plantations of different ages. Four different ages of Robinia pseudoacacia stands, including 10-year-old, 15-year-old, 25-year-old, and 40-year-old (abbreviated as Y10, Y15, Y25, and Y40, respectively) were selected, and 20 soil physicochemical and biological indicators were determined. The variation in soil microbial biomass was influenced by sampling depth, and consistent with the variations in TN (soil total nitrogen) and SOC (soil organic carbon) during 25 years' artificial forestation. Soil moisture increased significantly at Y15 and then decreased at Y40 but other soil properties remained relatively stable. The contents of phosphor lipid fatty acid (PLFA) of different microbial groups followed the order of B (Bacteria) > G(-) (Gram-negative) > G(+) (Gram-positive) > A (Actinomycetes) > F (Fungi). The ratios of F/B (Fungi to Bacteria) and Sat/Mono (Saturated PLFAs to Monosaturated PLFAs) of different ages of plantations showed a similar trend, i.e., declined first, then rose, and declined again. The ratios of Cy/Pre (Cyclopropyl PLFAs to Precursor PLFAs) and G(+)/G(-) (Gram-positive to Gram-negative) of the soil of all ages of plantations showed a trend of slow growth and a trend of rapid growth, respectively. Redundancy analysis showed that the contents of individual PLFAs and total PLFA were positively correlated with SOC and TN, but variations of soil PLFA ratios mostly depended on other soil properties. After artificial forestation, the ratios of F/B and Sat/Mono were lower than before forestation, while the ratio of Cy/Pre varied with different soil layers. The ratio of G(+)/G(-) increased with the increase in afforestation time, peaking at the 25th year. The contents of individual PLFAs and total PLFA may be sensitive indicators of SOC and TN within 25 years' plantation. Lower ratio of F/B and higher G(+)/G(-) suggest that the sustainability of the ecosystem is weaker and the fertility of the soil is lower after plantation of Robinia pseudoacacia.					zhang, bx/HNR-3314-2023; Luo, Chaoyi/AGS-5084-2022															2071-1050				NOV	2020	12	21							9161	10.3390/su12219161	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12219161													WOS:000589204600001
J	Yu, HY; Chen, YT; Zhou, GS; Xu, ZZ				Yu, Hongying; Chen, Yingting; Zhou, Guangsheng; Xu, Zhenzhu			Coordination of leaf functional traits under climatic warming in an arid ecosystem	BMC PLANT BIOLOGY												Background Climatic warming is increasing regionally and globally, and results concerning warming and its consequent drought impacts have been reported extensively. However, due to a lack of quantitative analysis of warming severities, it is still unclear how warming and warming-induced drought influence leaf functional traits, particularly how the traits coordinate with each other to cope with climatic change. To address these uncertainties, we performed a field experiment with ambient, moderate and severe warming regimes in an arid ecosystem over 4 years. Results Severe warming significantly reduced the specific leaf area and net photosynthetic rate with a relatively stable change and even enhancement under moderate warming, especially showing species-specific performance. The current results largely indicate that a coordinated trade-off can exist between plant functional traits in plant communities in a dryland ecosystem under ambient temperature conditions, which is strongly amplified by moderate warming but diminished or even eliminated by severe warming. Based on the present findings and recent results in the relevant literature, we advance the ecological conceptual models (e.g., LES and CSR) in the response to climatic warming in arid grassland communities, where the few key species play a crucial role by balancing their functional performances to cope with environmental change. Conclusion Our results highlight the importance of coordination and/or trade-off between leaf functional traits for understanding patterns of climatic change-induced vegetation degradation and suggest that the plant community composition in these drylands could be shifted under future climate change.

Restoring Palmer's agave in a Lehmann lovegrass dominated grassland in southeastern Arizona	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Dryland restoration is becoming increasingly challenging in arid and semiarid regions, such as in the southwestern United States, due to rapid land degradation, the spread of non-native species, and climate change. The development of strategies to enhance restoration of native species, particularly culturally and ecologically important native plants like Palmer's agave (Agave palmeri), is particularly critical in southeastern arid lands where scarce rainfall, herbivory, and invasive species dominance pose unique challenges to land management. In a large field experiment in southeastern Arizona, U.S.A., we assessed the utility of several management techniques to promote restoration and revegetation outcomes for Palmer's agave survival and growth, including protection from solar insolation and herbivory, and reduction in the competitiveness of Lehmann lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana). We found that the combination of herbivory protection and shade resulted in the highest survival of planted agaves, while the shade treatment alone resulted in the largest agaves. In fact, our results suggest that dense Lehmann lovegrass cover protects agaves from direct sunlight and predation. If land managers are challenged by widespread Lehmann lovegrass, they can opt to mechanically reduce it. However, if population recovery of Palmer's agave is a priority and fire hazard is minimal, our work suggests that stakeholders concerned with population recovery of Palmer's agave can forgo removing existing vegetation and plant agaves in a matrix of (and/or under the canopy of) existing vegetation.

J	Colloff, MJ; Pittock, J				Colloff, Matthew J.; Pittock, Jamie			Mind the Gap! Reconciling Environmental Water Requirements with Scarcity in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia	WATER												The Murray-Darling Basin Plan is a $AU 13 billion program to return water from irrigation use to the environment. Central to the success of the Plan, commenced in 2012, is the implementation of an Environmentally Sustainable Level of Take (ESLT) and a Sustainable Diversion Limit (SDL) on the volume of water that can be taken for consumptive use. Under the enabling legislation, the Water Act (2007), the ESLT and SDL must be set by the "best available science." In 2009, the volume of water to maintain wetlands and rivers of the Basin was estimated at 3000-7600 GL per year. Since then, there has been a steady step-down in this volume to 2075 GL year due to repeated policy adjustments, including "supply measures projects," building of infrastructure to obtain the same environmental outcomes with less water. Since implementation of the Plan, return of water to the environment is falling far short of targets. The gap between the volume required to maintain wetlands and rivers and what is available is increasing with climate change and other risks, but the Plan makes no direct allowance for climate change. We present policy options that address the need to adapt to less water and re-frame the decision context from contestation between water for irrigation versus the environment. Options include best use of water for adaptation and structural adjustment packages for irrigation communities integrated with environmental triage of those wetlands likely to transition to dryland ecosystems under climate change.

In this research, pigeonpea nutrient (zinc, iron, vitamins C and A, total sugar, and protein) was determined at post-harvest following treatment, and 5, 7, 14, 21, and 60 days of storage. Treatments (un-blanched, blanched, oven-dried, blanched + oven-dried, podded) had significant effects (p < .01) on pigeonpea nutrients. Zinc and vitamin C contents were reduced by blanched treatment by 42% and 45%, respectively. After 60 days of storage, pigeonpea in the blanched + oven-dried treatment had the highest iron content (88%), while the podded sample had 20% zinc content due to moisture loss. Treatments resulted in the retention of iron (7.2 mg/100 g), zinc (2.8 mg/100 g), total sugars (4.3 mg/100 g), vitamin A (337.2 mu g/100 g), and protein (23 g/100 g) in threshed pigeonpea and vitamin C (28 mg/100 g) in podded pea at 60 days of storage. Optimum nutrient content was recorded at 14-21 days of storage. Impact statement As a food security crop grown in the dry regions where nutrient deficiency is rampant, enhanced nutrient retention in pigeonpea can optimize its utilization. Post-harvest treatments had significant effects on retention of iron, zinc, total sugars, vitamin A, protein, and vitamin C were recorded at 60 days of storage. Increased utilization of pigeonpea will enhance food security for farmers.

Moran eigenvector filtering of multi-year yield data with application to zone development	AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES & ENVIRONMENT												A time-series of yield monitor data may be used to identify field areas of consistently low or high yield to serve as productivity zones for site-specific crop management. However, transient factors that affect yield in 1 yr, but not every year, detract from this approach. The objective of this study was to illustrate Moran eigenvector spatial filtering (MESF) with results from analysis of multi-year crop yield data from two farm fields in the United States. The MESF method accounts for temporal autocorrelation within a common factor map representing the correlation across years and partitions stochastic geographic variation into spatially structured and unstructured components. Crop rotation data were utilized from a dryland field in east-central South Dakota and an irrigated field in southwestern Georgia. A random effects (RE) model was estimated that utilized eigenfunctions of a geographic connectivity matrix to account for spatially structured random effects (SSRE) and unstructured random effects (SURE) in standardized z scores of multi-year crop yield. The MESF method was evaluated with conventional averaging of unfiltered yield data as a reference for comparison. In South Dakota, the SSRE accounted for 26% of the yield variance shared across years. Distinct patterns appeared to be related to changes in soil type and landscape position. The Georgia field yielded similar results. The MESF is effective for revealing structured variation in a time series of yield monitor data and may be useful for defining productivity zones within fields.																				2639-6696					2021	4	1							e20140	10.1002/agg2.20140	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agg2.20140													WOS:000710547500002

Assessment of Relative Potencies of Nitrogen Sources on Seedling Root Systems	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Banding of N fertilizers below the seed is a common practice in direct seeded wheat dominated dryland agricultural systems, yet the placement of fertilizer below the seed has been shown to decrease yields and damage the root system architecture (RSA) in canola (Brassica napus). However, there is a lack of understanding as to which rates and sources of fertilizers might be safe for seedling root systems. The goal of this study was to compare the effect of three different N sources over a gradient of application rates on canola RSA. The effect of the fertilizer band on RSA has previously been imaged using rhizobox methods. However, the research presented here describes a novel technique for comparing sources and rates simultaneously while using the existing imaging technology. Canola seedlings were exposed to increasing rates of urea, ammonium sulfate (AS), and urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) from 0 mg N cm(-1) to 40 mg N cm(-1) placed 50 mm below the seed row. Canola showed significant changes in RSA as a result of the increasing ammoniacal-N fertilizer rate. Dose response curves were developed for urea, AS, and UAN, and median lethal doses (LD50s) for tap roots were estimated at 4.7, 9.7, and 20.6 mg N cm(-1), respectively. Comparisons between multiple measurements of the dose response curves revealed a consistent ranking of relative potencies among urea, AS, UAN (most to least toxic).

Cluster bean is known as relatively tolerant to drought and salinity stress. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the drought tolerance of cluster bean cultivar RGC-1025, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of the drought-stressed and control samples was performed. De novo assembly of the reads resulted in 66,838 transcripts involving 203 pathways. Among these transcripts, differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis resulted in some of the drought-responsive genes expressing alpha dioxygenase 2, low temperature-induced 65 kDa protein (LDI65), putative vacuolar amino acid transporter, and late embryogenesis abundant protein (LEA 3). The analysis also reported drought-responsive transcription factors (TFs), such as NAC, WRKY, GRAS, and MYB families. The relative expression of genes by qRT-PCR revealed consistency with the DEG analysis. Key genes involved in the wax biosynthesis pathway were mapped using the DEG data analysis. These results were positively correlated with epicuticular wax content and the wax depositions on the leaf surfaces, as evidenced by scanning electron microscope (SEM) image analysis. Further, these findings support the fact that enhanced wax deposits on the leaf surface had played a crucial role in combating the drought stress in cluster beans under drought stress conditions. In addition, this study provided a set of unknown genes and TFs that could be a source of engineering tolerance against drought stress in cluster beans.

Among diverse pathways to tackle moisture and nutrient stress in rainfed ecologies, conservation agriculture (CA) and foliar nutrition have the greatest potential due to their economic and environmentally friendly nature. Therefore, to understand ammonium thiosulphate (ATS)-mediated foliar S nutrition effects on yield, protein content, mineral biofortification, and sulphur economy of rainfed pearl millet under diverse crop establishment systems, a field study was undertaken. The results highlighted that pearl millet grain and protein yield was significantly higher under no-tillage +3 t/ha crop residue mulching (NTCRM) as compared to no-tillage without mulch (NoTill) and conventional tillage (ConvTill), whereas the stover yield under NTCRM and ConvTill remained at par. Likewise, grain and stover yield in foliar S application using ATS 10 mL/L_twice was 19.5% and 13.2% greater over no S application. The sulphur management strategy of foliar-applied ATS 10 mL/L_twice resulted in significant improvement in grain protein content, protein yield, micronutrient fortification, and net returns ((sic) 54.6 x 1000) over the control. Overall, ATS-mediated foliar S nutrition can be an alternate pathway to S management in pearl millet for yield enhancement, micronutrient biofortification and grain protein content increase under ConvTill, as well as under the new NTCRM systems.

The development of a biocontrol technique may be an optional approach to weed control. Bipolaris panici-miliacei strain SX5-2 was isolated from diseased Microstegium vimineum plants. Pathogenicity, host range test, culture and mass production, crop sensitivity, formulation development and field trials were conducted to evaluate the potential of this strain for a bioherbicide. Pathogenicity tests showed percent incidence was up to 90% at a conidial suspension concentration of 10(5) conidia/mL on M. vimineum under greenhouse conditions and more than 80% in the field. Host range tests on 57 species in 17 families determined that B. panici-miliacei strain SX5-2 was safe for rice, wheat, sorghum, soybean, cotton, vegetables, Zoysia japonica turf and most dicotyledonous plants. Only maize and sugar cane were severely infected. Pathogenicity bioassays showed that the strain could control those seven tested gramineous weeds Digitaria sanguinalis, Panicum virgatum, Echinochloa crus-galli, Microstegium japonicum, Microstegium nodosum, Sorghum sudanense and Leptochloa chinensis in the main dryland and paddy fields. Culture and mass-production studies revealed that combined submerged and solid fermentation with bran and sawdust was feasible for mass production of conidia. Therefore, based on virulent pathogenicity and feasible mass production, B. panici-miliacei may have a promising potential to be developed into a bioherbicide for biocontrol of grass weeds in most crops but not in susceptible maize or sugarcane.

Ten subjects were participated in this study and divided into two groups: continuous passive motion (CPM) therapy+walking exercise on dryland (CWD) and CPM+aqua walking exercise (CAW) groups. The repeated measures analysis of variance was used to verify the difference between the groups and the duration of the program. A paired t-test was used to verify the significance of the observed difference within the groups, and an independent t-test was used to verify the significance of the observed difference between different groups. In this study, ROM in the knee flexion showed interaction effect between the two groups. CAW had a significant increase of knee flexion angle compared to those in CWD. Also, strength on the knee flexors showed interaction effect between the two groups. CAW had a significant increase of knee flexion angle compared to those in CWD, while strength on the knee extensors showed no significant interaction effect between groups. Visual analogue scale (VAS) score showed interaction between the two groups. CAW had a significant increase of the VAS scores compared to those in CWD. Given these findings reported in present study, aqua walking exercise for patients with osteoarthritis is a very safe and effective therapeutic strategies that can move the joint in the optimal ROM.																			2288-176X	2288-1778				AUG	2021	17	4					265	269		10.12965/jer.2142432.216	http://dx.doi.org/10.12965/jer.2142432.216								34527638					WOS:000691884000008

This paper uses a mixed-method framework to characterize the complexity and heterogeneity of smallholder farming systems and identifies constraints to and opportunities for sustainable intensification. Specifically, the study: (i) characterized farm household typologies based on the diversity of livelihood assets; (ii) co-designed context- specific interventions through an iterative participatory process; and (iii) ex-ante evaluated such interventions to inform multiple stakeholders. We explored farming system diversity using data from 224 farm households in western Rajasthan, India. Employing multivariate statistical techniques and participatory validation, we identified 7 distinct farm household types. Participatory appraisal with multiple stakeholders revealed heterogeneity across farm household types. For instance, the interest of farmers in integrating perennial fruit trees even among the rainfed farm household types markedly varied: household type 1 preferred the multipurpose forestry tree, khejri which requires low labor inputs; household type 2 preferred market-oriented horticulture production; household type 3 did not opt for perennials but for small ruminants; and household type 4 (dominated by women) opted for small horticulture kitchen gardens. The study demonstrated the utility of a mixed-methods approach that addresses multi-dimensional heterogeneity to generate insights and assist in co-designing locally appropriate technologies across different farm types and agro-ecological regions to achieve sustainable intensification.

M.; Zhao, Jingxue; Wu, Gao-Lin			Climate change-induced shrub encroachment changes soil hydraulic properties and inhibits herbaceous growth in alpine meadows	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Alpine meadows have been experiencing rapid shrub encroachment, which can have profound effects on the hydrological processes and functions of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, the headwater region of many of Asia's largest rivers. However, little is known about how increasing degrees of encroachment affect the herbaceous growth and the soil hydraulic properties of these ecosystems. To fill this knowledge gap, we examined various plant and soil characteristics across a gradient of shrub encroachment at four sites. These sites encompassed an undisturbed alpine meadow as well as alpine meadows experiencing varying degrees of shrub encroachment, ranging from light to moderate and severe. Our results showed that herbaceous cover, density, above-and belowground biomass, and species richness of all shrub-encroached meadows were significantly lower than those of the unaltered alpine meadow. Conversely, soil field water capacity, total porosity, and noncapillary porosity were significantly higher at the encroached sites. Importantly, as the percent shrub cover increased, soil volumetric water content decreased at shrub understories. In general, plant and soil characteristics were significantly more altered at shrub understories than at interspaces, and the magnitude of these modifications was highly correlated with the percent shrub cover. Our study demonstrates that shrub encroachment in the Qinghai Tibetan Plateau improves soil hydraulic properties, but at the cost of alpine meadow herbaceous growth, and accompanied by a decrease in surface soil water content. Hence, we recommend that to effectively address shrub encroachment in these vital ecosystems, sustainable management strategies should prioritize the maintenance of grasslands and the protection of water resources.

However, previous studies on the chemical nature of WEOM in the erosion and deposition landscapes were controversial at site-level studies and mainly focused on surface soils, limiting our assessment of WEOM's environmental fate at larger and deeper scales. Here, we collected eroded soils and deposited sediments from a depth of 0-200 cm in five eroding catchments with an erosion intensity gradient across the Loess Plateau. We examined the concentration, composition, and potential sources of WEOM using UV-visible absorption and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix-parallel factor analysis. Soil WEOM quantity and quality varied significantly in the erosion and deposition landscapes, with greater variations in soils below 20 cm, where WEOM in the deposition zone was characterized by higher concentration, aromaticity, hydro-phobicity, and UVA and UVC humic-like components derived from terrestrial and soil organic matter. WEOM variations in deep soils increased with increasing erosion modulus among sites, and were mainly driven by changes in soil organic carbon concentration, aggregate stability, and carbon to nitrogen ratio. However, the pattern of WEOM parameters between erosion and deposition zones at 0-20 cm was opposite to that in soils below 20 cm. Vegetation inputs compensated the loss of organic matter in sites with suitable climatic status and weak erosion, and led to higher concentrations and exogenous features of WEOM in the surface erosion area. Concludingly, the WEOM concentration, components, and sources differed significantly between erosion and deposition zones, and these differences, as well as their response to erosion intensity, revealed an opposing pattern in surface and deep soils.

Seeds are typically rich in protein, fiber, prebiotic carbohydrates and minerals, such as iron and zinc. With changing climate and variability, the lentil crop faces frequent droughts and heat stress of varying intensity in its major production zones. In the present study, a set of 162 lentil accessions selected through the Focused Identification of Germplasm Strategy (FIGS) were screened for tolerance to heat stress and combined heat-drought stresses under field conditions at two contrasting locations, namely Marchouch and Tessaout in Morocco. The results showed a significant genotypic variation for heat tolerance and combined heat-drought tolerance among the accessions at both locations. Based on the heat tolerance index (HTI), accessions, namely ILL 7833, ILL 6338 and ILL 6104, were selected as potential sources of heat tolerance at Marchouch, and ILL 7814 and ILL 8029 at Tessaout. Using the stress tolerance index (STI), ILL 7835, ILL 6075 and ILL 6362 were identified as the most tolerant lines (STI > 1) at Marchouch, and ILL 7814, ILL 7835 and ILL 7804 (STI > 1) at Tessaout, under the combined heat-drought stress conditions.

Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is an important grain legume that plays a substantial role in nutritional food security, especially in the developing world. This study used a chickpea population collected from the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Area (ICARDA) genebank using the focused identification of germplasm strategy. The germplasm included 186 genotypes with broad Asian and African origins and genotyped with 1856 DArTseq markers. We conducted phenotyping for salinity in the field (Arish, Sinai, Egypt) and greenhouse hydroponic experiments at 100 mM NaCl concentration. Based on the performance in both hydroponic and field experiments, we identified seven genotypes from Azerbaijan and Pakistan (IGs: 70782, 70430, 70764, 117703, 6057, 8447, and 70249) as potential sources for high salinity tolerance. Multi-trait genome-wide association analysis (mtGWAS) detected one locus on chromosome Ca4 at 10618070 bp associated with salinity tolerance under hydroponic and field conditions. In addition, we located another locus specific to the hydroponic system on chromosome Ca2 at 30537619 bp. Gene annotation analysis revealed the location of rs5825813 within the Embryogenesis-associated protein (EMB8-like), while the location of rs5825939 is within the Ribosomal Protein Large P0 (RPLP0). Utilizing such markers in practical breeding programs can effectively improve the adaptability of current chickpea cultivars in saline soil. Moreover, researchers can use our markers to facilitate the incorporation of new genes into commercial cultivars.

Experimental rations containing different sorghum stovers and concentrate ingredients were processed into mash and offered in the form of complete rations viz. local sorghum, Phule chitra, IS 12015 and IS 23143-based diets. Significant variations were found among the four sorghum cultivars (local Sorghum and 3 dual purpose cultivars: Phule chitra, IS 12015, and IS 23143) in all the chemical constituents, except for ether extract, calcium (Ca), and phosphorus (P). The effects on in vitro gas production parameters were not appreciable. The cultivar based complete rations did not influence the weekly body weight changes of lambs during 120-day growth trial. Dry matter intake (DMI) of lambs fed dual purpose sorghum stover based rations was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the local sorghum stover based ration. Although the diets did not affect the feed conversion ratio (FCR), the dual purpose sorghum stover-based ration needed high cost per kg mutton production. The digestibilities of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM) and total carbohydrates (TCHO) were higher (P < 0.05) in the rations prepared from the stovers of improved sorghum cultivars. The crude protein (CP) digestibility and nitrogen (N) balance was higher (P < 0.05) in lambs fed Phule chitra based ration. Even though the diets did not affect Ca and P balance, a tendency of lower (P = 0.09) urinary Ca and P retention was found in sheep fed local sorghum-based ration. It can be concluded that among the four evaluated sorghum cultivars, Phule chitra cultivar performed better in terms of growth and nutrient utilization.

J	Davidson, B; Groner, E				Davidson, Benjamin; Groner, Elli			An arthropod community beyond the dry limit of plant life	JOURNAL OF ARID LAND												Water availability, which enables plant growth and animal activity, regulates dryland ecosystem function. In hyper-arid ecosystems, rain cannot support vascular plant growth. Therefore, hyper-arid vegetation is restricted to the lower topography, where runoff accumulates. Typically, food resources originating from areas of dense vegetation are dispersed across the desert floor, enabling animal life in areas lacking vascular plant growth. However, certain regions, such as the hyper-arid upper topography, may be devoid of plant-derived food resources. The present study examined arthropod activity in the upper topography of a hyper-arid desert, in comparison with arthropod activity in the lower topography. Pitfall traps were utilized to compare arthropod activity along unvegetated ridges with activity in parallel, vegetated riverbeds. Surprisingly, the study revealed dense arthropod communities in the barren upper topography. Arthropods collected in the upper topography represented 26% of total arthropod abundance. In addition, the overlap between arthropod identity in the ridges and wadis (i.e., riverbeds) was low, and certain arthropods were strongly affiliated with the ridges. The upper topographic communities included high numbers of silverfish (Zygentoma: Lepismatidae), malachite beetles (Psiloderes), and predatory mites (Acari: Anystidae), and these arthropods were present at various life stages. It remains unclear how arthropod communities can persist in the unvegetated upper topography of the hyper-arid study area. These results raise the possibility that other food sources, independent from vascular plants, may play a significant role in the life history of hyper-arid arthropods.																			1674-6767	2194-7783				JUN	2021	13	6					629	638		10.1007/s40333-021-0009-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-021-0009-1		JUL 2021											WOS:000673035200001

Inoculation and habitat amelioration efforts in biological soil crust recovery vary by desert and soil texture	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												As dryland degradation continues, it is increasingly important to understand how to effectively restore biocrust communities. Potential techniques include the addition of biocrust inoculum to accelerate biocrust recovery. Enhanced erosion typical of degraded environments creates a challenge for these approaches, due to loss by wind or water and burial by saltating particles. To retain and protect added inoculum, the inclusion of habitat-amelioration techniques can improve recovery rates. This study tested three different types of inoculum (field-collected, greenhouse-cultivated, and laboratory-cultivated biocrust) coupled with two treatments to augment soil stability and ameliorate habitat limitations: soil surface polyacrylamide additions and installation of straw barriers. This was done across two deserts (Great Basin and Chihuahuan) and separated into generally coarse- or finer-textured soils in each desert, with results monitored for 3 years (2015, 2016, 2017). While the inoculum type, coupled with habitat ameliorations, occasionally enhanced biocrust growth across years and treatments, in other cases, it made no difference compared to natural recovery rates. Rather, the desert location and soil texture groupings were the most prominent factors in determining recovery trajectories. Recovery proportions were similar in the finer-textured sites in both the Great Basin and the Chihuahuan deserts, while the coarser-textured site in the Great Basin did show some recovery over time and the Chihuahuan coarser-textured site did not. This study demonstrates the importance of understanding site potential and identifying key limitations to biocrust recovery for successful restoration projects.

Warming decreases desert ecosystem functioning by altering biocrusts in drylands	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												Warming and precipitation fluctuations are changing desert ecosystems in global drylands. However, the effects of climate change on keystone species such as cryptogamic biocrust in drylands remain relatively under-investigated, even though biocrusts play a vital role in desert ecosystems. We conducted a long-term experiment (14 years) to simulate the responses of two main types of biocrusts to warming coupled with reduction in precipitation that was achieved by open-top chambers (OTCs) to simulate the predicted warming and precipitation decreasing under climate change scenario. We also conduct a structural analysis to evaluate the resulting changes in desert ecosystem functioning (carbon and nitrogen cycling). Neither warming and corresponding rainfall reduction treatments had a negative effect on lichen species richness, but both treatments reduced lichen cover and biomass. The negative effects of warming on moss-dominated crusts were much greater than those on lichen-dominated crusts. Although mosses and lichens had varying degree responses to warming, the loss of mosses and decreased lichen cover and biomass, as well as the shortening of the wet time, resulted in a reduction in carbon and nitrogen fixation, soil enzyme activity and water-holding capacity of biocrusts and topsoil. These impacts collectively change the water balance of drylands and weaken the hydrological and biogeochemical function of biocrusts. Synthesis and applications: Results from this long-term experiment suggest that the ecosystem C and N cycling and water balance of global drylands may be highly impacted by climate change, in part because of the response of biocrusts, which contribute an important implication for both dryland restoration and earth system dynamics.																			0021-8901	1365-2664				2023 NOV 10	2023										10.1111/1365-2664.14528	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.14528		NOV 2023											WOS:001103069600001

However, most current air quality models do not consider this emission source, resulting in large uncertainties in PM simulations. Here we estimated the agricultural PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 mu m) emission around Kaifeng, a prefecture-level city in central China, using the Wind Erosion Prediction System (WEPS), with the MEIC (Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China) as an anthropogenic emission source. We then plugged these estimates into the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) to simulate an air pollution episode in Kaifeng, China. Results showed that the addition of agricultural soil PM2.5 emissions significantly improved the ability of WRF-Chem to accurately simulate PM2.5 concentrations. The PM2.5 concentration mean bias and correlation coefficient of not considered and considered agricultural dust emission were-72.35 mu g m- 3 and 3.31 mu g m- 3 and 0.3 and 0.58, respectively. The PM2.5 emitted by the agricultural soil wind erosion contributed around 37.79% of the PM2.5 in the Kaifeng municipal district during this pollution episode. This study confirmed that the dust emission caused by agricultural soil wind erosion can significantly impact urban PM2.5 concentrations which surrounded by large areas of farmland, and also indicated that coupling dust emissions from farmland with anthropogenic air pollutant emissions can improve the accuracy of air quality models.

INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS												The use of soil amendments and cultivated techniques are effective strategies in improving plant yield. Bakhtiari savory (Satureja bachtiarica Bunge.) is an endemic medicinal plant of Iran with various medicinal purposes. To observe the effect of cattle manure (30 t ha(-1)) and plant density (high plant density, HPD: 80,000; medium plant density, MPD: 40,000, and low plant density, LPD: 26,666 plants ha(-1)), an experiment was accomplished as split plot with three replicates during 2018 and 2019 on plant yield, nutrients concentration, essential oil (EO) yield and composition, and also stomatal properties of Bakhtiari savory in the dryland farming conditions. The maximum plant weight was observed with manure application at HPD plant density in the second year. The greatest concentrations of N, Ca, and Mg were obtained in the plans treated with manure application and HPD. The increase of plant density led to decreased EO content and increased EO yield. The highest EO yield was observed in second-year plants supplied with manure at HPD. The GC and GC/MS analysis showed that the main constitutes of Bakhtiari savory EO were p-cymene (18.6-43%), carvacrol (32.3-59.3%), gamma-terpinene (5-14.3%), thymol (0.6-17.8%), and linalool (2-4.3%), representing different concentrations under the manure and plant densities. Leaf stomatal density and length at LPD was lower compared with HPD and MPD, while increased density of EO glands was obtained at LPD. To sum up, cattle manure and HPD can result in higher plant production.																			0926-6690	1872-633X				MAR	2022	177								114516	10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.114516	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.114516		JAN 2022											WOS:000779419000001

Previous studies on the adaptive traits of dryland maize have mainly focused on soil moisture and nutrients, rather than analyzing potential factors for the adaptive traits of root zone warming. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of different root zone warming ranges on the agronomic traits, hormones, and microstructures of maize seedling roots and leaves. The results showed that minor increases in the root zone temperature significantly enhanced maize seedling growth. However, when the temperature in the root zone was excessive, the stem diameter, root surface area, root volume, total root length, dry matter accumulation, and root/shoot biomass of maize seedlings sharply decreased. Under high temperature stress in the root zone, the root conduit area; root stele diameter; root content of trans-zeatin (ZT), gibberellin A(3) (GA(3)), and indoleacetic acid (IAA); leaf thickness; upper and lower epidermis thickness; and leaf content of ZT and GA(3) were significantly decreased. The hormone content and microstructure changes might be an important reason for root growth maldevelopment and nutrient absorption blockage, and they also affected the leaf growth of maize seedlings. Compared with the 'senescent' maize type Shaandan 902 (SD902), the plant microstructure of the 'stay-green' maize type Shaandan 609 (SD609) was less affected by increased temperatures, and the ability of the root system to absorb and transport water was stronger, which might explain its tolerance of high temperature stress in the root zone.					张, 贵鑫/GRO-0384-2022	张, 贵鑫/0009-0003-4982-1432; Zhang, Shibo/0000-0002-6268-7739; XIa, Zhenqing/0000-0002-7326-4459														2077-0472				JUN	2021	11	6							477	10.3390/agriculture11060477	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11060477													WOS:000665467200001

Nitrogen- and phosphorus-starved <i>Triticum</i> <i>aestivum</i> show distinct belowground microbiome profiles	PLOS ONE												Many plants have natural partnerships with microbes that can boost their nitrogen (N) and/or phosphorus (P) acquisition. To assess whether wheat may have undiscovered associations of these types, we tested if N/P-starved Triticum aestivum show microbiome profiles that are simultaneously different from those of N/P-amended plants and those of their own bulk soils. The bacterial and fungal communities of root, rhizosphere, and bulk soil samples from the Historical Dryland Plots (Lethbridge, Canada), which hold T. aestivum that is grown both under N/P fertilization and in conditions of extreme N/P-starvation, were taxonomically described and compared (bacterial 16S rRNA genes and fungal Internal Transcribed Spacers ITS). As the list may include novel N- and/or P-providing wheat partners, we then identified all the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were proportionally enriched in one or more of the nutrient starvation- and plant-specific communities. These analyses revealed: a) distinct N-starvation root and rhizosphere bacterial communities that were proportionally enriched, among others, in OTUs belonging to families Enterobacteriaceae, Chitinophagaceae, Comamonadaceae, Caulobacteraceae, Cytophagaceae, Streptomycetaceae, b) distinct N-starvation root fungal communities that were proportionally enriched in OTUs belonging to taxa Lulworthia, Sordariomycetes, Apodus, Conocybe, Ascomycota, Crocicreas, c) a distinct P-starvation rhizosphere bacterial community that was proportionally enriched in an OTU belonging to genus Agrobacterium, and d) a distinct P-starvation root fungal community that was proportionally enriched in OTUs belonging to genera Parastagonospora and Phaeosphaeriopsis.

Rainfall erosivity reflects soil erosion potential driven by rainfall, which is essential for soil erosive risk assessment. This study investigated the spatiotemporal variation of rainfall erosivity and its impacts on sediment load over the largest freshwater lake basin of China (the Poyang Lake Basin, abbreviate to PYLB). The spatiotemporal variations of rainfall erosivity from 1961 to 2014 based on 57 meteorological stations were detected using the Mann-Kendall test, linear regression, and kriging interpolation method. The sequential t test analysis of regime shift (STARS) was employed to identify the abrupt changes of sediment load, and the modified double mass curve was used to assess the impacts of rainfall erosivity variability on sediment load. It was found that there was significant increase (P<0.05) in rainfall erosivity in winter due to the significant increase in January over the last 54years, whereas no trend in year and other seasons. Annual sediment load into the Poyang Lake (PYL) decreased significantly (P<0.01) between 1961 and 2014, and the change-points were identified in both 1985 and 2003. It was found that take annual rainfall erosivity as the explanatory variables of the double mass curves is more reasonable than annual rainfall and erosive rainfall. The estimation via the modified double mass curve demonstrated that compared with the period before change-point (1961-1984), the changes of rainfall erosivity increased 8.0 and 2.1% of sediment load during 1985-2002 and 2003-2014, respectively. Human activities decreased 50.2 and 69.7% of sediment load during the last two periods, which indicated effects of human activities on sediment load change was much larger than that of rainfall erosivity variability in the PYLB.

Roots are the prime organs for water and nutrient uptake. Fine tuning between water uptake, efficient use and loss determines the genotypic response to water limitations. Targeted breeding for root system architecture needs to be explored to improve water use efficiency in legumes. Hence, the present study was designed to explore root system architecture in lentil germplasm in response to drought. A set of 119 lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) genotypes was screened in controlled conditions to assess the variability in root traits in relation to drought tolerance at seedling stage. We reported significant variation for different root traits in lentil germplasm. Total root length, surface area, root volume and root diameter were correlated to the survival and growth under drought. Among the studied genotypes, the stress tolerance index varied 0.19-1.0 for survival and 0.09-0.90 for biomass. Based on seedling survival and biomass under control and drought conditions, 11 drought tolerant genotypes were identified, which may be investigated further at a physiological and molecular level for the identification of the genes involved in drought tolerance. Identified lines may also be utilised in a lentil breeding program.

Soil ecoenzymatic stoichiometry can reflect the ability of soil microorganisms to acquire energy and nutrients, and drive nutrient cycling and carbon (C) decomposition in HM contaminated soil. Therefore, for the first time, we used the enzymatic stoichiometry modeling to examine the microbial nutrient limitation in rhizospheric and bulk soil of different plants (Medicago sativa, Halogeton arachnoideus and Agropyron cristatum) near the Baiyin Copper Mine. Results showed that the main pollutants in this area were Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb, while Cd and Zn have the greatest contribution according to the analysis of pollution load index (PLI). The activities of soil C-, nitrogen (N)-, and phosphorus (P)-acquiring enzymes in the rhizosphere of plants were significantly greater than that in bulk soil. Moreover, microbial C and P limitations were observed in all plant treatments, while the lower limitation was generally in the rhizosphere compared to bulk soil. The HM stress significantly increased microbial C limitation and decreased microbial P limitation, especially in the rhizospheric soil. The partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) further indicated that HM concentration has the greatest effects on microbial P limitation (-0.64). In addition, the highest enzyme activities and the lowest P limitation were observed in the rhizospheric and bulk soil of M. sativa, thereby implying that soil microbial communities under the remediation of M. sativa were steadier and more efficient in terms of their metabolism. These findings are important for the elucidation of the nutrient cycling and microbial metabolism of rhizosphere under phytoremediation, and provide guidance for the restoration of HM-contaminated soil.

We looked at how nursery light regimes and nitrogen fertilization affected the survival and performance of Pinus pinaster Ait. under contrasting post-planting watering regimes. Seedlings grown in the nursery for 13 months were given low or high nitrogen doses and exposed to three light regimes (full sun, medium light and low light). After outplanting, half of the seedlings were watered fortnightly during the hottest months of the first summer and the other half were left unwatered. Seedling size-related variables (shoot height, basal diameter, stem volume and sturdiness quotient) were measured at the beginning and at the end of the study, and summer drought survival was checked three times. Our results showed that fertilization and the nursery light regime influenced initial seedling quality and transplant stress. Post-planting first summer watering also increased seedling survival probability. The medium-light and especially the full-sunlight regimes in the nursery decreased the probability of seedling mortality after outplanting. However, a low-light regime in the nursery negatively affected plant traits and increased the probability of post-planting seedling mortality. In comparison with low-N seedlings, high-N fertilization increased post-planting stress (evaluated in the change of sturdiness quotient after one field growth season), but did not affect survival.

However, the extent to which root traits (size and structure) determine plant presence in water-limited environments is still poorly understood. Here we investigated how root traits vary across water availability gradients within a dry South African biome.Location South Africa.Methods We measured six below-ground (root) and eight above-ground (leaf + stem) traits of 124 individuals of nine dominant woody shrub species from wetter and drier sites (600-700 vs 250-300 mm annual precipitation) in the Fynbos biome of the Cape Floristic Region. Within sites, we sampled from recently burnt and unburnt/more mature vegetation and at three locations along topographical gradients.Results Drier regions showed greater maximum rooting depth, length, root dry matter content and root to shoot ratio. These trait patterns were consistent at an intraspecific level, along locally drier topographical locations and in post-fire environments. Roots accounted for significant whole-plant trait variation. Additionally, in drier conditions, we found increased root allocation deviating from expected global allometric relationships. Our study also demonstrates that the combination of fire and drought in the driest locations results in poor above-ground vegetation recovery in terms of plant size, cover and individual counts with only resprouters persisting.Conclusions Our research suggests that root investment in Fynbos shrubs will likely be key for coping with a drier and warmer future and should be a focus of more research for dryland biomes.

Light limitation and density-dependent interactions affect plant performance, but few studies have experimentally evaluated the effects of these factors on invasive and native neighbors simultaneously. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that light limitation and density-dependent interference are critical factors that influence the performance of the invasive speciesBromus madritensisssp.rubens("B. rubens") and three native species that commonly compete withB. rubensin North American drylands. In a full-factorial experiment, we examined the effects of (a) light limitation, (b) increasingB. rubensseed density, and (c) increasing native seed density on the establishment, survival, and biomass of each study species over a 12-week growing period in a controlled greenhouse. Light limitation reduced at least one performance metric (establishment, survival, or biomass) for all species. IncreasingB. rubensseed density had no intraspecific effect on its own performance but had variable and species-specific negative effects on natives. Increasing native seed density reducedB. rubensestablishment, survival, and biomass but had variable and species-specific effects on the natives themselves. These findings suggest that light intensity and density-dependent interactions can strongly but differentially influence the establishment, survival, and biomass of an important subset of invasive and native species in North American drylands. Evaluating multiple performance metrics at the species level is essential for understanding how invasive and native neighbors respond to environmental variation in changing dryland ecosystems.

Winter cover crop production and water use in Southern Great Plains cotton	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Cover crops can provide several ecosystem services in agricultural cropping systems. Benefits may be enhanced with increasing cover crop biomass production. In water-limited environments, feasibility of cover crop germination and production is not always certain. This study was conducted to determine differences in biomass production, water use, and water use efficiency (WUE) between monoculture cover crops and a mixture at Chillicothe, TX, in the Southern Great Plains under rainfed conditions in a continuous cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cropping system over a 6-yr period. Evaluated cover crops included Austrian winter pea (Pisum sativum L.), crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.), hairy vetch (Vicia villosa L.), hard red winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and a grass/broadleaf mixture. Although cover crops were planted after optimum planting dates and under varying climatic conditions, biomass production was 2863, 2480, and 2301 kg ha(-1) for the mixture, pea, and vetch, respectively. Peas and the mixture were the most consistent, producing significantly greater biomass than wheat and clover but not more than vetch. The mixture resulted in greater WUE than wheat. Clover resulted in reduced biomass production and WUE than vetch, pea, and the mixture over the study period. A cover crop mixture did not produce significantly greater biomass or significantly increase water use efficiency compared with vetch and pea. Under dryland conditions, peas, vetch, and a mixture were shown to be viable cover crop options in Southern Great Plains cotton systems, performing as well as a wheat cover crop.

Multifunctionality debt in global drylands linked to past biome and climate	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Past vegetation and climatic conditions are known to influence current biodiversity patterns. However, whether their legacy effects affect the provision of multiple ecosystem functions, that is, multifunctionality, remains largely unknown. Here we analyzed soil nutrient stocks and their transformation rates in 236 drylands from six continents to evaluate the associations between current levels of multifunctionality and legacy effects of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) desert biome distribution and climate. We found that past desert distribution and temperature legacy, defined as increasing temperature from LGM, were negatively correlated with contemporary multifunctionality even after accounting for predictors such as current climate, soil texture, plant species richness, and site topography. Ecosystems that have been deserts since the LGM had up to 30% lower contemporary multifunctionality compared with those that were nondeserts during the LGM. In addition, ecosystems that experienced higher warming rates since the LGM had lower contemporary multifunctionality than those suffering lower warming rates, with a similar to 9% reduction per extra degree Celsius. Past desert distribution and temperature legacies had direct negative effects, while temperature legacy also had indirect (via soil sand content) negative effects on multifunctionality. Our results indicate that past biome and climatic conditions have left a strong "functionality debt" in global drylands. They also suggest that ongoing warming and expansion of desert areas may leave a strong fingerprint in the future functioning of dryland ecosystems worldwide that needs to be considered when establishing management actions aiming to combat land degradation and desertification.

Genotypic variation in whole-plant transpiration efficiency in sorghum only partly aligns with variation in stomatal conductance	FUNCTIONAL PLANT BIOLOGY												Water scarcity can limit sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) production in dryland agriculture, but increased whole-plant transpiration efficiency (TEwp, biomass production per unit of water transpired) can enhance grain yield in such conditions. The objectives of this study were to quantify variation in TEwp for 27 sorghum genotypes and explore the linkages of this variation to responses of the underpinning leaf-level processes to environmental conditions. Individual plants were grown in large lysimeters in two well-watered experiments. Whole-plant transpiration per unit of green leaf area (TGLA) was monitored continuously and stomatal conductance and maximum photosynthetic capacity were measured during sunny conditions on recently expanded leaves. Leaf chlorophyll measurements of the upper five leaves of the main shoot were conducted during early grain filling. TEwp was determined at harvest. The results showed that diurnal patterns in TGLA were determined by vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and by the response of whole-plant conductance to radiation and VPD. Significant genotypic variation in the response of TGLA to VPD occurred and was related to genotypic differences in stomatal conductance. However, variation in TGLA explained only part of the variation in TEwp, with some of the residual variation explained by leaf chlorophyll readings, which were a reflection of photosynthetic capacity. Genotypes with different genetic background often differed in TEwp, TGLA and leaf chlorophyll, indicating potential differences in photosynthetic capacity among these groups. Observed differences in TEwp and its component traits can affect adaptation to drought stress.

Understanding charges-related surface characteristics at various aqueous solution conditions is critical for bentonite application in various fields, including material modification and environmental restoration. In this study, the evolution of surface properties (surface potential, surface electric field strength, specific surface area, and surface charge numbers) for bentonite samples was investigated using simple ion-exchange experiments and extended combined determination method at different pH conditions. Zeta potential, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) techniques were used to examine changes in bentonite structure and surface functional groups. The results demonstrated that surface potential was considerably negative (larger in absolute value) and more sensitive to pH variation than the zeta potential of bentonite under identical conditions. At multiple pH settings, the surface electric field strength and the numbers of bentonite's surface charges were inversely proportional to hydrogen ion concentrations. Cations covalently bonded to clay's surface might reduce negative surface charges and diminish surface electric field strength, particularly as ionic strength increased. Although moderate pH variation has no discernible effect on bentonite interlayer structural alterations, moderate clay dissolution and changes in mineralogical properties may increase the specific surface area of bentonite, particularly when the solvent chemical conditions are acidic. This study comprehensively sheds light on the evolution of surface properties of bentonite clay under acidic, neutral and alkaline conditions, which is helpful in understanding and optimizing its surface performance for material and environmental applications.					liu, jiaming/IWE-3196-2023														0927-7757	1873-4359				OCT 5	2021	626								127067	10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.127067	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.127067		JUL 2021											WOS:000685958800004

Yield effects of climate-smart agriculture aid investment in southern Malawi	FOOD POLICY												Binding resource constraints in many low- and middle-income countries aggravate food insecurity risk in the face of climate change. To help mitigate such risk and increase food security, international development agencies have invested billions of dollars in climate-smart agriculture (CSA) programs over the past decade. However, rigorous evidence on the food security impacts of CSA aid through crop yields remains scant generally, and specifically in sub-Saharan Africa. Most studies have not explicitly linked CSA adoption and yield impacts with CSA aid interventions among smallholder farmers. Here, we respond to this knowledge gap by estimating the impact of a major CSA aid effort (the United States Agency for International Development-funded Wellness and Agriculture for Life's Advancement (WALA) project) on agricultural yields in Southern Malawi. Based on primary survey data from a sample of 808 households in the project area, we use endogenous switching regression and a control function approach to estimate CSA adoption and impacts on maize yield in 2016, controlling for potential program placement bias, selection bias in CSA adoption, and endogeneity issues. We found a 53% increase in maize yield among CSA adopters in the drought year of 2016. Results demonstrate that policies and funding streams supporting CSA in low-income, dryland contexts such as southern Malawi can have important impacts on food security by boosting crop yields in the face of increasing climate uncertainty and extreme weather shocks.

To reverse soil deterioration in drylands, a promising tool is the ex situ cultivation of biological soil crusts, topsoil geobiological assemblages that provide key ecosystem services. One approach is to transplant biocrusts cultivated in greenhouse nursery facilities into degraded sites to accelerate recovery. Lichen- and moss-dominated biocrusts have been successfully grown using a common, sandy soil. We compared the use of a common, sandy soil versus native soils as a substrate for the cultivation of cyanobacteria-dominated biocrusts. In greenhouse experiments, we inoculated natural biocrusts collected from three Southwestern USA dryland sites on to either a common, sandy soil or on their respective native soils. The common substrate resulted in a moderate enhancement of growth yield relative to native soils. While changes in bacterial phyla composition remained low in all cases, the use of a common substrate introduced larger shifts in cyanobacterial community composition than did using native soils. The shift increase attributable to the common, sandy soil was not catastrophic-and typical cyanobacteria of field biocrusts remained dominant-unless textural differences between the common substrate and native soils were marked. Because collecting native soils adds a significant effort to growing cyanobacterial biocrusts in greenhouses for restoration purposes, the use of a common, sandy substrate may be considered by land managers as a standard practice. But we recommend to regularly monitor the composition of the grown biomass.

This may lead to an adjustment of livelihood strategies and behavior of pastoral households, involving a change in attitudes toward livestock, pasture condition and social norms. We use an agent-based model to examine long-term social-ecological consequences and implications for system resilience of such behavioral changes (e.g., giving up a social norm). The model captures feedback between pastures, livestock and household livelihood in a common property grazing system. We systematically compare three stylized household behavioral types (traditional, maximizer and satisficer) that differ in their preferences for livestock, their compliance with social norms on pasture resting and how they are influenced by the behavior of others. Simulation results show that the traditional, norm-abiding household type maintains the pasture condition, provided that overall household numbers do not exceed a critical threshold. In contrast, a switch to a maximizer type that ignores norms may lead to long-term pasture degradation and livestock loss, pushing the system to an undesirable state. A change toward a new satisficing household type that constrains its herd size while diversifying its income sources can lead to improved pasture conditions and higher total livestock numbers, even with increased household numbers. We conclude that changes in household behavior have strong implications for long-term social-ecological system dynamics and have to be considered to assess the resilience of pastoral common property systems.

Phenotyping Drought-Induced Morpho-Physiological Changes and Genetic Diversity Among Pigeon Pea (<i>Cajanus cajan</i> (L.) Millsp.) Genotypes	PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTER												Drought stress at reproductive stages is mainly responsible for low yield in pigeon pea especially in semi-arid regions. Understanding genetic makeup at the phenotypic and genotypic level for stress tolerance-related traits is critical for the selection of diverse parental lines and in designing the breeding program for genetic enhancement of the crop. In view of this, we assessed the responses of different pigeon pea genotypes under irrigated and drought stress conditions for two consecutive years through morpho-physiological characterization and genotyping using SSR markers for assessing diversity at the genomic level. The study revealed high genetic diversity for morpho-physiological traits of which photosynthesis and water use efficiency were found to be useful in screening for drought tolerance. Cluster and PCoA analysis revealed diverse genotypic groups by stress tolerance and maturity duration. Genotyping using genic and genomic SSRs revealed 109 unique alleles with an average of 2.09 alleles per marker with the average polymorphic information content (PIC) value of 0.28 and a range of 0.09 to 0.60 between genotypes. This study helped in identifying diverse genotypes with stress tolerance and provide an insight for the selection of parental lines for using them in the genetic enhancement program in pigeon pea.																			0735-9640	1572-9818				JUN	2023	41	2					304	316		10.1007/s11105-022-01366-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11105-022-01366-2		DEC 2022											WOS:000905967000001
J	Andrade-Díaz, MS; Piquer-Rodríguez, M; Baldi, G				Soledad Andrade-Diaz, Maria; Piquer-Rodriguez, Maria; Baldi, German			Conservation opportunities for threatened paleochannel grasslands in the South American Dry Chaco	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												Subtropical drylands, such as the South American Dry Chaco, harbor azonal grasslands in ancient river beds (hereafter, paleochannels). These grasslands host high biodiversity and provide numerous ecosystem services. However, cultivated systems often replace paleochannels grasslands due to their biophysical characteristics and low investment requirements. Furthermore, there is a lack of basic characterization of paleochannel grasslands due to their complexity, which challenges their conservation. Here, we mapped and described for the first time the paleochannel grasslands of the Argentinean Dry Chaco based on their current land cover, spatial configuration, EVI values (a proxy for primary productivity), fragmentation, and protection. We speculate that natural (i. e., shrub encroachment enhanced by overgrazing and fire management prohibition) and anthropogenic processes (i.e., farming and infrastructure) have transformed the Argentinean Dry Chaco grasslands into woody-dominated or agricultural systems. Therefore, while grasslands in low-transformation matrices were mainly replaced by shrubs, those in high-transformation matrices were integrated into agricultural landscapes (i.e., whole units fragmented by croplands and roads). However, paleochannels in medium-transformation matrices showed the highest grassland cover, EVI values, and intermediate fragmentation level. Located in the NW of the Argentinean Dry Chaco, this group of paleochannels should be prioritized in future conservation and management strategies, as currently is not included in any protection scheme. Our work highlights the need to include non-pristine systems that have received perturbation in the past in conservation actions to mitigate and reduce the degradation of threatened dryland habitats.																			1617-1381	1618-1093				FEB	2023	71								126306	10.1016/j.jnc.2022.126306	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2022.126306		NOV 2022											WOS:000896867300002

On the other hand, global wheat productivity is greatly affected due to drought and low fertility of soil under arid and semi-arid regions. Application of supplementary irrigation and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) has been suggested as sustainable measures to combat drought stress and to improve soil fertility and, hence, crop yield. This research was undertaken to study the effect of supplementary irrigation together with a combination of various PGPR on the growth and yield of two wheat cultivars, namely Sardari and Sirvan. The results of variance analysis (mean of squares) showed that the effect of irrigation, cultivar, and irrigation and biofertilizer and irrigation on height, spike length, seed/spike, and numbers of spikes/m(2), 1000-seed weight, and grain yield were significant at 1% probability level. The effect of cultivar and irrigation interactions showed that the highest grain yield was obtained in a treatment with two additional irrigations in Sirvan cultivar (5015.0 kg/ha) and Sardari (4838.9 kg/ha) as compared to the 3598 kg/ha and 3598.3 kg/h grain yield in Sirvan and Sardari cultivars with similar treatment, but without irrigation, i.e., dryland farming. Drought conditions significantly affected the wheat grain yield while supplementary irrigation resulted in 39.38% and 34.48% higher yields in Sirvan and Sardari cultivars.

Unraveling Misunderstandings about Desertification: The Paradoxical Case of the Tabernas-Sorbas Basin in Southeast Spain	LAND												From its origins, the concept of desertification has been controversial. The prevailing confusion between two desertification visions, one that considers it as the expansion of deserts and another that emphasizes its anthropogenic component, has been transferred to society. Here we illustrate misunderstandings about desertification using a very illustrative case from the Tabernas-Sorbas Basin (Almeria, Spain), where striking badlands that are often used as an image of desertification coexist with an intensive olive agriculture that is irreversibly deteriorating the only oasis in continental Europe (Los Molinos spring). The olive tree is a traditional Mediterranean dryland crop and until the 1950s only about 200 ha were irrigated in this area. However, the profitability of the crop has caused irrigation to expand to 4400 ha in the last two decades. The process of intensification has been reinforced giving way to super-intensive irrigation, which involves going from 210 to 1550 trees/ha, which in a few years already occupies more than 1500 ha. The effects on the water balance of the aquifer feeding these crops have been severe, and the flow of the Los Molinos spring has gone from more than 40 L/s for the period 1970-2000 to the current 7.28 L/s. Unraveling the mechanisms of land degradation and its main drivers are the first step to propose management actions to achieve a more sustainable use of resources and to combat desertification.

B.			Expression of transcription factors involved with dehydration in contrasting rice genotypes submitted to different levels of soil moisture	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH												Plant tolerance to abiotic stresses, such as water deficit, is triggered by complex multicomponent signaling pathways. One of the plant responses to stress conditions is expression of a large number of genes whose products are involved in various adaptive functions. Transcription factors (TFs) are important regulators of gene expression, modulating the transcription initiation rate of target genes; they are critical components in signal transduction in response to abiotic stress. Our hypothesis is that genotypes with contrasting tolerance signal water deficit through TFs (10 genes of the DREB family and bZIP) with differing degrees of expression. We believe that these genes will have greater expression in the flooded genotype because drought is an atypical condition in these plants. We tested two rice (Oryza sativa) genotypes: BRS Querencia (flooded) and AN Cambara (dryland). When they reached stage V5, the plants were submitted to water deficit, at different levels of soil moisture, 20%, 10% and recovery. In general, we observed that expression varies according to the soil moisture and the genotype. In addition, the coexpression analysis generated seven cluster interactions with several genes. Our hypothesis was confirmed in part; the contrasting genotypes gave different degrees of expression; however, we ca not affirm that the flooded genotype has more significant responses in dry soil because there were variations in expression demonstrating oscillation in metabolism, and the data do not allow us to associate expression with greater drought tolerance.					do Amaral, Marcelo Nogueira/C-4906-2016; Auler, Priscila Ariane/ABA-5225-2020	do Amaral, Marcelo Nogueira/0000-0003-3180-7803; Auler, Priscila Ariane/0000-0001-9045-7626													1676-5680					MAR 31	2019	18	1							gmr18247	10.4238/gmr18247	http://dx.doi.org/10.4238/gmr18247													WOS:000467795800001

However, the spatial distribution of lake chemistry and the factors affecting such pattern are still unclear. Here, we collected data for carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus from published literature and databases in 224 lakes and calculated the trophic status index to represent the nutrient classification state of lakes. We found that lakes with high carbon concentrations were located in the Tibet-Qinghai Limnetic Region of western China, whereas lakes with high nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were located in the Inner Mongolia-Xinjiang Limnetic Region and Northeast Limnetic Region of northern China. Areas with larger cropland and urban residential land (such as the junction of the three lake regions, i.e., the Northeast Limnetic Region, East Limnetic Region, and Inner Mongolia-Xinjiang Limnetic Region) tended to have lakes with high nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Our analysis suggested that spatial distribution of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations reflect the effect of climate, geomorphology, and land use in each lake region and nationwide.

J	Wang, ZJ; Su, Y				Wang, Zhijie; Su, Yuan			Assessment of Soil Erosion in the Qinba Mountains of the Southern Shaanxi Province in China Using the RUSLE Model	SUSTAINABILITY												The Southern Shaanxi Province, an important ecological security barrier area in central China, is the primary water source of the south-to-north water transfer project in China. However, severe soil erosion seriously affects the safety of regional ecological security and water quality of the water diversion project. To reveal the characteristics and variation of soil erosion in the southern Shaanxi Province after the implementation of a series of eco-environmental construction measures, in this study, the spatio-temporal characteristics of soil erosion from 2000 to 2014 were evaluated based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The average soil erosion of southern Shaanxi Province in China was characterized as slight (less than 500 t.km(-2).a(-1)) and mild erosion (500-2500 t.km(-2).a(-1)) with an average soil erosion modulus of 1443.49 t.km(-2).a(-1), 1710.49 t.km(-2).a(-1), 1771.99 t.km(-2).a(-1) and 1647.74 t.km(-2).a(-1) in 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2014, respectively. The results revealed an increase in soil erosion until 2000 and a mitigation during the period of 2000 to 2014. After 2010, the soil erosion was controlled effectively. The spatial distribution of soil erosion displayed obvious spatial heterogeneity, and the high soil erosion (greater than 2500 t.km(-2).a(-1)) was primarily distributed in the north-central and south counties of the study area. The soil erosion remained high and aggravated in six counties (i.e., Zhen'an, Zhashui, Ningshan, Ningqiang, Lueyang and Shanyang), and high erosion (greater than 5000 t.km(-2).a(-1)) was found in the regions with slope gradients greater than 35 degrees and the middle mountainous (800-2000 m) regions. Therefore, the eco-environmental construction measures could effectively control soil erosion. However, unreasonable human activities remain the primary cause of soil erosion in the southern Shaanxi Province. In the future, more comprehensive and thorough ecological construction measures will be necessary to ensure regional ecological security and the eco-environmental quality of water sources.

However, many soil detachment models are established on conceptual assumptions rather than experimental data. The objectives of this study were to establish a model of soil detachment by rill flow based on flume experimental data and to quantitatively verify the model. We simulated the process of soil detachment by rill flow in flume experiments with a soil-feeding hopper using loessial soil on steep slopes. Seven flow discharges, six slopes and five sediment loads were combined. Soil detachment capacity, sediment transport capacity, and soil detachment rate by rill flow under different sediment loads were measured. The process of soil detachment by rill flow can be modelled by a dual power function based on soil detachment capacity and transport capacity deficit as variables. The established model exhibited high credibility (NSE=0.97; R-2=0.97). The contributions of soil detachment capacity and transport capacity deficit to soil detachment rate by rill flow reached 60% and 36%, respectively. Soil detachment capacity exerted more influence on soil detachment rate than did transport capacity deficit. The performance of the WEPP rill erosion equation is also favourable (NSE=0.95; R-2=0.97). The two power exponents in the model we established strengthen the role of soil detachment capacity in soil detachment rate and weaken that for transport capacity deficit. Soil detachment capacity and transport capacity deficit played important roles in the determination of soil detachment rate by rill flow. The results can be applied to implement the numerical modeling and prediction of rill erosion processes on steep loessial hillslopes. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Precipitation-mediated responses of plant biomass production and allocation to changing soil pH in semiarid grasslands	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Biomass and its allocation are crucial to understand carbon cycling. Climate change and human disturbance potentially alter soil pH, but it remains unclear how biomass production and its partitioning respond to altered soil pH. Here, we investigated how changing soil pH (acidification and alkalization) affected above- and belowground biomass production and allocation (hereafter AB, BB and BB/AB, respectively) at nine sites representing desert, typical, and meadow grasslands with increasing precipitation across a 1500-km transect in Inner Mongolia, China. The results showed that soil acidification reduced AB in typical and meadow grasslands, whereas soil alkalization reduced AB in desert and typical grasslands. Changing soil pH did not affect BB in desert or typical grasslands, but reduced BB in meadow grasslands. Altered soil pH negatively impacted species richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity, and dominant species biomass across all grasslands. BB/AB was increased by soil acidification and alkalization along the study transect. Soil C, N and C:N ratio were not affected by changing soil pH in three types of grasslands. Response ratios of AB, BB/AB and dominant species biomass were positively correlated with precipitation under altered soil pH, whereas response ratios of BB were negatively correlated with precipitation under soil alkalization. Variance partitioning analysis showed that the response of biomass and its allocation to altered soil pH were mainly explained by community composition but not soil fertility. Structural equation model analysis demonstrated that precipitation mediated the responses of biomass distribution to soil pH changes in semi-arid grasslands mainly via altering the response of dominant species. Our results indicate that dry grasslands with low productivity and precipitation generally allocate more C to belowground than wet grasslands regardless of pH change. These findings can improve our predictions of carbon dynamics in grassland ecosystems under climate change.																			0167-8809	1873-2305				NOV 1	2022	339								108123	10.1016/j.agee.2022.108123	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2022.108123		AUG 2022											WOS:000849766500007

Yield Response and Drought Mitigation Strategy of Cotton by Foliar Feeding of Plant Nutrients under Rainfed Agriculture in Black Soil (<i>Typic Chromusterts</i>)	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS												A field experiment was conducted to study the influence of foliar application of plant nutrition on yield attributes, yield and nutrient uptake of cotton (KC 3) at the Agricultural Research Station, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Kovilpatti during rabi season 2013-16. The experiment was laid out in a Randomized Block Design (RBD) comprising nine treatments replicated thrice under rainfed condition. These results revealed that the treatment imposed as recommended dose of fertilizers (40:20:40 kg of Nitrogen: Phosphorus: Potassium/ha) along with 1.25% cotton plus at square formation and flowering stages increased the yield attributes and yield of cotton (KC 3) viz., sympodial branches/plant (89.9 nos), number of bolls (9.9 nos), boll weight (3.8 g), dry matter production (1909 kg/ha) and therefore it influenced the seed cotton yield (912 kg/ha).

We detected qnrS-positive E. coli in a total of 74 samples from feces (n = 59), the carcass surface (n = 7), and retail meat (n = 8). These 74 qnrS-positive isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of certain antimicrobials and genetically characterized. Ampicillin-resistance accounted for 71 of the 74 isolates (96%), followed by resistance to oxytetracycline (57/74; 77%), enrofloxacin (ERFX) (56/74; 76%), sulfisoxazole (SUL) (56/74; 76%), trimethoprim (TMP) (49/74; 66%), and dihydrostreptomycin (48/74; 65%). All farmborne SUL- and TMP-resistant isolates except one were obtained from samples from farm A where a combination of sulfadiazine and TMP was administered to the chickens. Concentrations of ERFX at which 50 and 90% of isolates were inhibited were 2 mg/mL and 32 mg/mL, respectively. Diverse pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns of XbaI-digested genomic DNA were observed in the qnrS-positive isolates from fecal samples. Several isolates from feces and the carcass surface had identical XbaI-digested PFGE patterns. S1-nuclease PFGE and Southern blot analysis demonstrated that 7 of 11 dfrA13-positive fecal isolates carried both the qnrS and dfrA13 genes on the same plasmid, and 2 of 3 dfrA1-positive isolates similarly carried both qnrS and dfrA1 on the same plasmid, although the PFGE patterns of XbaI-digested genomic DNA of the isolates were different. These results suggest that the qnrS gene is prevalent in chicken farms via horizontal transfer of plasmids and may partly be co-selected under the use of TMP.

Soil and water conservation measures, especially reforestation and check dam construction, have been progressively implemented in this region for several decades. During this period, the corresponding precipitation in the region is also changing dynamically. However, it is still unclear how precipitation variations, land use changes and check dams affect soil erosion and sediment yield in a typical watershed. A combination of field investigations and model simulations was employed to quantitatively identify the impacts of the above three factors on soil erosion and sediment yield in the Kuye River watershed. Significant land use changes, including the conversion of arable land and bare land into grassland, shrubland, forestland and construction land, occurred in the studied watershed from 1987 to 2016. In addition, 306 key dams were built in the watershed, with a total storage capacity of 316.64 Mm3, according to statistical data obtained in 2011. A hot spot analysis showed that the regions that were at high risk of soil erosion and sediment yield were mainly concentrated in the middle reaches of the watershed. The simulation results showed that check dams were the dominant factor affecting sediment load, reducing the total sediment load by 54% in 2006. However, from 1987 to 2016, the contributions of the three studied factors (precipitation variation, land use changes and check dams) to sediment reduction were 29%, 40% and 31%, respectively, which indicated that these factors all had significant influences on the sediment load. More attention should be paid to check dams, and corresponding measures should be taken to protect them, especially during flood periods. These results can serve as a reference for watershed management and policy implementation.																			0925-8574	1872-6992				MAY 1	2021	163								106198	10.1016/j.ecoleng.2021.106198	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2021.106198		MAR 2021											WOS:000634956300006

Managing for ecological resilience of pinyon-juniper ecosystems during an era of woodland contraction	ECOSPHERE												Dryland woodland ecosystems worldwide have experienced widespread drought- and heat-related tree mortality events coupled with extreme wildfire behavior. In contrast to other forest types where the emphasis has been on the silvicultural enhancement of ecosystem resilience and restoration of structural heterogeneity, limited frameworks are available for management to improve drought resilience in semiarid woodlands. This challenge is especially acute in pinyon-juniper woodlands, a dominant vegetation type across western North America that has experienced extensive tree die-off over the past several decades while simultaneously undergoing expansion in portions of its range. In this paper, we describe the critical and urgent need to manage for future drought resilience in these highly vulnerable ecosystems and synthesize the current state of knowledge on how to enhance woodland resilience to drought coupled with high temperatures and associated disturbances. We present a landscape prioritization framework for guiding management goals and practices that requires prioritization of efforts based on the need for action and the probability of a positive outcome. Four guiding factors include historical woodland structure and drivers of long-term landscape change, current vegetation structure and composition, future climate suitability, and habitat and resource value. In summarizing the strength of evidence supporting our recommendations, we identify critical knowledge gaps and highlight the importance of adaptive management strategies that reflect current uncertainties. This will ultimately allow for improved management of diverse semiarid woodland ecosystems that are undergoing substantial changes due to past and present land use, biological invasions, and climate change.

Maize experiment in a traditional Zuni agroecosystem: nutrient composition	AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS												Maize has sustained the Zuni and other peoples of the arid American Southwest for more than four millennia. In Zuni dryland agriculture, fields on alluvial fans and other valley-edge landforms are managed to receive supplemental water and nutrients by retaining storm runoff and associated sediment and organic material transported from adjoining uplands. An experiment with Zuni blue maize (Zea mays L.) and commercial hybrid maize was conducted in two Zuni fields to study traditional maize and its productivity as part of a larger study of Zuni agroecosystems. Following a closely related paper on maize growth and productivity, studies of maize nutrient composition and quality are presented here. More nutrient differences occurred between Zuni and hybrid maize than between runoff and other treatments. Zuni grain had higher concentrations of more nutrients than hybrid maize, and for several elements, there was an inverse pattern in grain vs. leaf nutrient concentration between cultivars. Zuni grain had a higher N (protein) concentration than hybrid maize, and a higher proportion of N in grain vs. leaf, indicating an ability to partition more N and other nutrients into grain. Parallel differences in maize and soil N and P were found between the two fields, though the cultivars had different P content patterns. Overall, agronomically sufficient concentrations of most nutrients were present across cultivars and treatments. Long-term production and nutrient management of maize grown without conventional irrigation or fertilization reflect a traditional agroecosystem that incorporates sustainable practices intended to maintain productivity with conservation of soil and water resources.

In the United States, chickpeas are integral components of dryland agriculture systems throughout the Pacific Northwest and Northern Plains, but seed rot and preemergent damping-off of chickpea caused by metalaxyl-resistant isolates of Pythium ultimum Trow have emerged as diseases of increasing importance in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. The objective of this study was to identify sources of resistance to metalaxyl-resistant P. ultimum in chickpea. Resistance was evaluated based on the emergence of chickpea seedlings from soil artificially infested with the pathogen. Significant differences in emergence were consistently detected between the desi chickpea cultivar 'Myles' and the kabuli chickpea cultivar 'Sierra'. These two cultivars were used as checks to screen two different chickpea mini-core collections, including a 39-accession mini-core collection from the U.S. National Plant Germplasm System and 209 accessions from a chickpea mini-core collection developed by International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT). A total of 194 desi accessions and 41 kabuli accessions were significantly more resistant than Sierra, whereas 85 desi accessions identified from the ICRISAT collection were highly resistant to both P. ultimum isolates. Accessions with pigmented seed coats were significantly more resistant than accessions with beige seed coats, which is a characteristic of kabuli chickpeas. Two accessions, W6 25882 and W6 25884, may be especially promising parental materials for improving kabuli cultivars based on their consistent resistant reactions to P. ultimum isolates and higher 100-seed weight.

Characterizing reduced height wheat mutants for traits affecting abiotic stress and photosynthesis during seedling growth	PHYSIOLOGIA PLANTARUM												Most high-yielding, semidwarf wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown around the world contains either Rht1 or Rht2 genes. The success of these high-yielding cultivars is greatest in the most productive farming environments but provide marginal benefits in less favorable growing conditions such as shallow soils and low-precipitation dryland farming. Further, growing evidence suggests semidwarf genes not only affect early seedling growth but limit grain yield, especially under abiotic stress conditions. There are 23 other reduced-height mutants reported in wheat, most of which have not been functionally characterized. We evaluated these mutants along with their parents for several traits affecting seedling emergence, early seedling growth, and photosynthetic efficiency. Two- to seven-fold differences in coleoptile length, first leaf length, root length, and root angle were observed among the genotypes. Most of the mutations had a positive effect on root length, while the root angle narrowed. Coleoptile and first leaf lengths were strongly correlated with emergence. A specialized deep planting experiment identified Rht5, Rht6, Rht8, and Rht13 with significantly improved seedling emergence compared to the parent. Among the mutants, Rht4, Rht19, and Rht12 ranked highest for photosynthetic traits while Rht9, Rht16, and Rht15 performed best for early seedling growth parameters. Considering all traits collectively, Rht15 showed the most promise for utilization in marginal environments followed by Rht19 and Rht16. These wheat mutants may be useful for deciphering the underlying molecular mechanisms of understudied traits and breeding programs in arid and semiarid regions where deep planting is practiced.

However, the evolutionary and genetic roles of both K+ uptake mechanisms for drought tolerance are not fully explored in crops adapted to dryland agriculture. Here, we employed evolutionary bioinformatics, biotechnological and electrophysiological approaches to determine the role of two important K+ transporters HvAKT2 and HvHAK1 in drought tolerance in barley. HvAKT2 and HvHAK1 were cloned and functionally characterized using barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing (BSMV-VIGS) in drought-tolerant wild barley XZ5 and agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer in the barley cultivar Golden Promise. The hallmarks of the K+ selective filters of AKT2 and HAK1 are both found in homologues from strepotophyte algae, and they are evolutionarily conserved in strepotophyte algae and land plants. HvAKT2 and HvHAK1 are both localized to the plasma membrane and have high selectivity to K+ and Rb+ over other tested cations. Overexpression of HvAKT2 and HvHAK1 enhanced K+ uptake and H+ homoeostasis leading to drought tolerance in these transgenic lines. Moreover, HvAKT2- and HvHAK1-overexpressing lines showed distinct response of K+, H+ and Ca2+ fluxes across plasma membrane and production of nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide in leaves as compared to the wild type and silenced lines. High- and low-affinity K+ uptake mechanisms and their coordination with H+ homoeostasis play essential roles in drought adaptation of wild barley. These findings can potentially facilitate future breeding programs for resilient cereal crops in a changing global climate.

This study reports the impacts of a single strategic tillage applied to long term no-till soils (10-16 years) with a scarifier or offset discs, compared with ongoing no-till, on soil conditions and crop growth over four seasons at three locations in southern New South Wales, Australia. The tillage occurred just prior to sowing in autumn and under different management conditions at each site. The effect of a single tillage on wet aggregate stability (WAS) ranged from 0 to 14% loss of macro-aggregates, and the recovery time was generally one or two years with the exception of one site-year. The effect of a single tillage on saturated hydraulic conductivity was not statistically significant. Crop establishment was decreased by tillage in some site-years but effects on crop dry matter and grain yield tended to be neutral or minor. In most cases, seasonal effects and crop sequence had a much larger effect on crop productivity than tillage. The results demonstrated that strategic use of tillage within an otherwise no-till system generated minor and short term impacts on soil conditions. Strategic tillage therefore provides a tool for more flexible management of soil, pest and weed constraints to ensure long term productivity and sustainability of dryland mixed farming systems in southern New South Wales, Australia.

In this study, we investigated the vertical patterns of soil C change with different lengths of land use history in the arid regions of China and explored the controls and mechanisms of these changes. One native desert grassland and six croplands with similar management but different cultivation times (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 15, 30, and 50 years) and were selected in Xinjiang, Northwest China. We measured both soil organic and inorganic C concentrations and soil properties (e.g., total nitrogen [N], NO3--N, NH4+-N, pH, and electrical conductivity) with a 20-cm depth interval down to 2 m in all croplands. The results showed that soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks increased with cultivation year for the topsoils (0-120 cm), which could be a result of higher plant C inputs and decreased soil pH in cropland than in the native desert. Soil pH explained the largest variation (45%) of SOC concentration. Soil inorganic C (SIC) stocks decreased with cultivation year in topsoils layers (0-40 cm) but increased in deep soil layers (120-200 cm), resulting in the net increment of SIC to the depth of 200 cm. This pattern might be caused by changes in soil pH in the cropland. Overall, this study demonstrated that, instead of reducing soil C, proper management of the desert ecosystem can enhance soil C sequestration in the arid regions.

The food environments in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) have been experiencing rapid and dynamic transitions across the globe, necessitating a system-level thinking and systemic approach to understand opportunities for improvement. There is a need for valid, reliable measures of food and nutrition environments for reorienting thinking and data collection toward determinants of food demand, especially the food environment components, which are critical to understand the transforming food systems. Food environment transformations are urgently required to provide consumers with more affordable and nutritious diets capable of meeting social and environmental challenges. In the present perspective, we aim to provide insights on prioritizing research on understanding and designing evidence based inclusive food environments which is crucial for promoting long-term food system innovations that are economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable and, above all, contribute to sustainable healthy diets.																				2571-581X				JUN 13	2023	7								1120757	10.3389/fsufs.2023.1120757	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1120757													WOS:001016345300001
J	Li, SL; Wang, S; Shangguan, ZP				Li, Shuailin; Wang, Shuo; Shangguan, Zhouping			Combined biochar and nitrogen fertilization at appropriate rates could balance the leaching and availability of soil inorganic nitrogen	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Biochar has been proposed to ameliorate soil properties and plant growth. However, it remains unclear how the interaction between biochar and nitrogen (N) fertilizer impacts soil inorganic nitrogen (SIN) leaching and availability in dryland systems. Therefore, a two-year field experiment was carried out on the Loess Plateau in northern China to study the effects of biochar combined with N fertilizer on the leaching and availability of SIN. Biochar applied at 0, 20 and 40 t ha(-1) (B0, B1 and B2, respectively) interacted with three N fertilization levels (0, 120 and 240 kg N ha(-1); N0, N1 and N2, respectively). Winter wheat (Triticum aestivurn L.) was cultivated in a winter wheat-summer fallow cropping system. We measured wheat aboveground biomass and residual SIN in the soil profile (0-60 cm at 10 cm intervals) using standard extraction methods (2 M KCL, shaking at 25 degrees C for 1 h). Additionally, to ascertain whether field-aged biochar captured SIN and to determine residual SIN availability, we also used a modified extraction method (2 M KCL, shaking at 60 degrees C for 2 h) and ion exchange membranes (IEMs) to extract SIN from plow layer soil (0-20 cm). Our results indicated that biochar application alone in the absence of N fertilization had no significant effect on wheat biomass or residual SIN in the soil profile. However, compared with the application of N fertilizer alone, the application of biochar at 20 t ha(-1) combined with N fertilizer not only increased wheat biomass by 12.2-13.8% but also significantly decreased residual NO3--N in the subsoil by 13.2-74.7%. Nevertheless, long-term N fertilization at 240 kg N ha(-1) led to large amounts of residual NO3--N without a significant increase in crop biomass, which inevitably increased the risk of leaching during the fallow period. Although the application of biochar at 40 t ha(-1) combined with N fertilizer more effectively decreased residual SIN in the subsoil, this approach was impractical because it decreased wheat biomass. Furthermore, the difference between NO3--N extracted via the modified method and via the standard method increased with biochar application under each N level. Thus, field-aged biochar absorbed a certain amount of NO3--N, thereby sequestering N in the soil after two years of N fertilization. Hence, biochar could reduce the residual NO3--N available for leaching during the fallow period. However, notably, overuse of biochar could reduce the amount of NO3--N available not only for leaching but also for crops. Ultimately, the application of biochar at 20 t ha(-1) combined with N fertilization at 120 kg N ha(-1) is a promising dual-win strategy for improving N availability while concurrently mitigating SIN leaching.

In a 2-year field experiment, variations in P-dependent root proliferation and their impact on stalk strength, lodging resistance, and grain quality traits of quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) were studied. Basal P fertilizer applications (control, 50, 100, and 150 kg ha(-1) of superphosphate) were applied, and lodging rate and related traits were investigated. The quinoa grown without P-inputs exhibited 15% less root surface area and 17-19% less root diameter than 100 kg P ha(-1). The application of 150 kg P ha(-1) increased total root length by 17 and 8% in the 2 years. Control plants exhibited higher total soluble sugar fraction and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, while this pattern was notably reverted after 100 kg P ha(-1) application. Furthermore, the total free protein, lipid, and starch content of quinoa grains were enhanced by P application which exhibited 8, 5-12, and 10% increase at 100 kg P ha(-1), respectively. This primarily suggested amelioration of oxidative stress by P-application linked with high superoxide dismutase activity and inhibition of lipid peroxidation in quinoa roots. Therefore, we singled out 100 kg P ha(-1) as the optimal level, promoting stalk strength and reducing the risk of lodging through enhancements in root diameter and stalk strength, leading to increased quinoa yield and grain quality traits.

Although the changes in sediment-associated organic carbon (OC) concentration and source have great impact on the stability and fate of eroded OM on Earth, the response of OM sources of sediment aggregate fluxes in eroding landscapes to land uses still remain unclear. In this study, we selected three sediment deposit profiles in a typically dam-controlled catchment of the Chinese Loess Plateau to trace the 60-year changes in sediment yields and then explored the historical distributions of aggregate-associated OM sources through using the fallout radioisotope dating (Cs-137 and (210)Pbex) and the isotope mixing model based on aggregate size-specific C-13 and N-15 isotope signatures. The results showed that the deposition rates of sediment trapped the check dam displayed a decreasing trend with year except for an abrupt increase in 2013 over the past 60 year, ranging from 4.47 x 10(3) to 89.16 x 10(3) t km(-2) yr(-1). The average SOC and TN concentrations in deposit profile showed the following order of macroaggregates (>0.25 mm, 9.55 g kg(-1) for SOC and 0.81 g kg(-1) for TN) > microaggregates (0.053-0.25 mm, 4.16 g kg(-1) for SOC and 0.42 g kg(-1) for TN) > silt-clay (< 0.053 mm, 2.41 g kg(-1) for SOC and 0.33 g kg(-1) for TN), despite there was a opposite trend of mass fraction in aggregate sizes. The data of C-13 and C/N among aggregate sizes indicated that the OM in siltclay fraction had higher decomposition rate than that of other aggregates. The modeling outputs further showed that cropland was the primary contributing sources to transported OM of aggregate flux, accounting for > 20% of the total. Our results demonstrated the influence of erosion processes and changes in land use on the sediment yield and aggregate-associated OM dynamics in this Loess region.																			0167-8809	1873-2305				NOV 1	2021	321								107606	10.1016/j.agee.2021.107606	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2021.107606		AUG 2021											WOS:000704402800001

Particle size is an important factor that affects both the van der Waals potential energy and electrostatic potential energy. However, the size effect of soil particles on surface charge properties and suspension stability has rarely been investigated. Results showed that the zeta potentials (in absolute values) of soil colloidal particles (CP, particle diameter less than 1000 nm) were higher than soil nanoparticles (NP, particle diameter less than 100 nm) for the same solution pH, while the specific surface area of soil NP was 1.6 times of soil CP; taken together, the surface charge density of soil NP was smaller than that of soil CP and the surface charge number of soil NP was slightly higher than soil CP. The stability of soil NP and CP was also different. The critical coagulation concentration (CCC) of soil NP was 1.4 times of soil CP, indicating higher mobility of smaller soil particle in natural conditions. Based on DLVO theory, the Hamaker constants of soil NP and CP were simulated to be 2.06 x 10(-20) J and 1.86 x 10(-20) J. It could be concluded that the size effect of soil particle influences suspension stability and particle mobility through its effect on Hamaker constant. The results could deepen our understanding for aggregation mechanisms of soil colloid-sized particles and further help in predicting their environmental behaviors.																			0016-7061	1872-6259				FEB 1	2020	359								113999	10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.113999	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.113999													WOS:000498751000008

The purpose of this study was to define the vegetation coverage thresholds of runoff and soil erosion in the Loess Plateau, and quantify the effect of vegetation coverage changes on soil and water loss, and evaluate the effective vegetation coverage in different climatic regions. A total of 59 watersheds were involved in the meta-analysis, including 38 counties belonging to 6 provinces in the Loess Plateau. The vegetation coverage increased from 2.51% to 86.80%, the runoff modulus ranged from 155.7 to 780431.8 m(3).km(-2).a(-1), and the soil erosion modulus ranged from 400 to 58285 t.km(-2).a(-1). Three specific vegetation coverage thresholds were identified for soil erosion: the lower threshold (0%-35%), the transition (35%-65%), and the upper threshold (65%-100%); four specific vegetation coverage thresholds were identified for runoff: the low threshold (0%-20%), the transition (20%-50%), the high threshold (50%-75%), and the upper threshold (75%-100%). In the Loess Plateau, the effective vegetation coverage in the cold and arid regions is 25.12%, in the semi-humid region is 51.02%, in the semi-arid region is 45.92%, and in the arid region is 26.53%, to which corresponding ecological management strategies should be adopted. Clarifying the impact of vegetation coverage on water and soil loss at the regional scale can provide insight into suitable management programs for the new pattern of runoff and soil erosion formed by the vegetation restoration in the Loess Plateau.

Germplasm Conserved at the ICRISAT Genebank	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Finger millet is an important drought-tolerant and grain-nutrient dense food crop grown in semi-arid regions in Asia and Africa. The forage is used as a source of dry roughage for feeding livestock. In this study, the finger millet diversity panel (310 accessions and four controls) representing the global collection of the finger millet germplasm conserved at the ICRISAT genebank was assessed for forage quality and diversity in the years 2018 and 2019. Results of the study suggested that finger millet can generate stover yield ranging from 2890 to 10,779 kg ha(-1). Finger millet forage contained 6.47% to 8.15% of crude protein, >90% of dry matter content, 11.47% to 14.17% of ash content, 62.36% to 67.73% of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), 33.07% to 38.37% of acid detergent fiber (ADF), 3.95% to 4.80% of acid detergent lignin (ADL), 6.18% to 6.89% of metabolizable energy (ME) and 45.21% to 49.09% of in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) with the grain yield of 810 to 3698 kg ha(-1) at maturity stage. The per se performance between the races, regions, and biological status has been performed and differed significantly for important traits. The 314 accessions were grouped into five clusters based on the performance for food-feed traits. Except for crude protein, there was a positive relationship between forage quality-positive traits and grain yield, indicating that agronomic and forage quality traits could be improved simultaneously. The top 10 promising accessions for important forage quality traits and accessions with multiple forage quality traits were identified. This study provides a detailed understanding of the variability that exists in forage quality traits in crop residues and their association with agronomic traits in the finger millet germplasm. The identified top-performing accessions would be the key genetic resources for developing dual-purpose cultivars and the information from this study will be useful for future finger millet food-feed trait improvement.

They limit nutrient and water uptake from the subsoil which can limit grain yields. Recent research has shown that ameliorating subsoils with organic amendments can improve yields on these soils but the mechanisms underpinning this response remain unclear. Thus, different subsoil amelioration practices were imposed once at the high- and medium-rainfall sites followed with different crop sequences from 2018 to 2020. Both sites had poorly-structured sodic clay subsoils. The four experimental treatments assessed were 1) unamended control, 2) deep-banded gypsum, 3) chicken manure pellets applied to the topsoil, and (4) deep-banded in the subsoil. Compared to the control, both manure treatments significantly (p < 0.05) increased greenness in the upper leaves (SPAD readings), the green leaf area, and green leaf duration, and thereby delayed canopy senescence. The manures generally increased leaf N concentrations at anthesis, and at mid grain fill in all cereal crops, but not in faba bean. The manures also increased photosynthetic rates and instantaneous transpiration efficiencies (ITEs) in upper leaves of both cereal and faba bean crops, during grain or pod fill, but not in very dry years. Only one site and year combination, i.e. Tatyoon in 2018, showed an increase in grain yield. Despite the favourable effects of manures on crop canopies, unfavourable seasonal (rainfall) conditions were considered to be the major factor that limited yield increases by manured crops. Manuring in the medium-rainfall regions is likely ineffective in terms of crop productivity improvement.

The Puna Pastoralist System: A Coproduced Landscape in the Central Andes	MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT												In mountain socioecological systems, the interaction between nature and people is at the core of planning local long-term sustainable development strategies. Pastoralism is the main traditional socioeconomic livelihood in dryland mountains. It is strongly associated with long-established land use practices that provide essential material and relational contributions, both of which shape human populations and nature. The aim of this work is to characterize the traditional pastoralist system of the Puna (northwest Argentina) in a framework that highlights its diverse values and valuations within nature-people coproductions. We use the conceptual framework of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services as a tool to analyze and understand these socioecological systems. We also identify 3 coproduction types at different steps of the benefit flow from ecosystems to quality of life. Pastoral livelihood persists in the Argentine Puna, cocreating a landscape with natural and anthropic (water sources, grasslands, wildlife, livestock, and techniques) elements interacting through complex mechanisms involving environmental conditions and cultural and economic practices. Some drivers that threaten the system's sustainability are overexploitation and land use change. These are visible as poaching or conversion of pasturelands into mining areas. Finally, we identify a number of knowledge gaps. These include lack of information on some regulatory contributions of nature to people, biodiversity status, and trends and statistical information on Indigenous Peoples and local communities; the flow of relationships; and coproductions related to the local expression of the quality of life. We also highlight the need for spatially explicit information and comprehensive knowledge of drivers and socioecological dynamics of the landscape.

SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT												Long-term use of white plastic film mulching is an important reason for premature leaf senescence of spring mulch maize in the Weibei Plateau area of China. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of black plastic film mulching on leaf senescence characteristics and yield of spring maize. In 2017 and 2018, a field experiment was conducted in Changwu County, China. The experiments included three treatments: black film mulching (BFM), white plastic film mulching (WFM) and bare land (BL), and two varieties: Shandan 609 (green keeping variety sd609) and Shandan 902 (early maturing variety sd902). A split-plot experimental design was used to research the effects of different mulching techniques on leaf protective enzyme activities, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, chlorophyll content of leaves as represented by the SPAD value, dry matter quality and yield of spring maize. The results indicated that the SPAD value, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity of maize leaves under the BFM treatment were significantly higher than that under the WFM or BL treatment. The MDA content was also lower than that in the WFM and BL treatments. There were differences in the degree of influence among the varieties. Compared with WFM and BL, BFM significantly increased aboveground biomass and yield of the two maize varieties. In the dryland area, which had intense light and high temperature, using BFM helped to slow down leaf senescence in the late maize stage and increase yield; it was especially effective for the early maturing maize variety.					zhang, min/IYI-9869-2023; Jin, Jin/JTV-5024-2023; Zhao, Min/JGM-3156-2023	Fu, Yafang/0000-0002-4783-7401													0266-0032	1475-2743				JAN	2022	38	1					1044	1053		10.1111/sum.12677	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sum.12677		NOV 2020											WOS:000594046500001

To obtain baseline data to map salt, or the soil electrical conductivity of a saturated soil paste extract (ECe, dS m(-1)), we use electromagnetic (EM) data from a survey of EM38 and EM34 data with EM inversion software (EM4Soil). This is because the collected apparent electrical conductivity (ECa, mS m(-1)) can be inverted to estimate true electrical conductivity (sigma, mS m(-1)) and correlated with ECe. To do this we use a quasi-two dimensional (Q-2D) model along a pseudo-transect, which includes seven soil sample locations, to make a linear regression (LR) calibration between sigma and ECe(i.e., ECe= 0.0122 x sigma - 0.0535 [R-2= .71]). From the joint inversion of interpolated EM38 and EM34 EC(a)across 40,000 ha, a quasi-three dimensional (Q-3D) model was then used to predict ECe. The model was validated using 30 soil sample locations scattered across the area. The agreement between predicted and measured EC(e)was moderate (Lin's concordance = 0.59) and conclude that useful information on a reconnaissance scale can be obtained and indicates where more detailed information may be collected to confirm areas of moderate salinity. To better predict ECe, more EC(a)could be collected on smaller grid spacings (i.e., 0.5 km and 1 km in irrigated and dryland areas, respectively). To improve resolving depth of EC(e)we recommend including EC(a)from a single-frequency multiple-coil array DUALEM-421.

J	Pazhavand, Z; Sadeghi, H				Pazhavand, Zahra; Sadeghi, Hossein			Using fig and eucalyptus for ecosystem restoration and management: good choices with carbon storage ability	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) and fig (Ficus carica) are considered as two of the most important forest species worldwide with nutritional values. This study was carried out in the Ahoochar region, during 2015-2017.This study was conducted to compare the ability of fig and eucalyptus in carbon sequestration as well as some of soil characteristics. This study was conducted as factorial experiment within a complete randomized design. According to the obtained results, fig trees have higher ability of carbon sequestration compared with eucalyptus. Soil of fig trees had a higher pH, bulk density, organic matter, organic carbon, and carbon sequestration compared with eucalyptus. However, the electrical conductivity (EC) of eucalyptus soil was significantly higher than fig. The amounts of organic carbon, organic matter, and carbon sequestration at the soil depth of 0-15 cm were significantly higher than the depth of 15-30. Shallower soils contained higher percentages of organic carbon in comparison with deeper soils, and there was a significant difference between the depths of 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm which contained 1.72% and 0.87% of organic carbon, respectively. The highest percentage of organic carbon was measured in the fig soil at a depth of 0-15 cm (2.33%), whereas the lowest percentage (0.58%) was measured in the control soil at 15-30 cm. In total, fig tree with a good ability in carbon sequestration can be a good candidate for the forest management and rehabilitation especially in dry and semi dryland.

Predictions of the relationship between the pattern of (im)permeable surfaces and hydrological outcomes tend to fall into two categories: (i) generalized metrics of landscape pattern, often referred to as connectivity metrics, and (ii) direct simulation of specific hillslopes. Unfortunately, the success of using connectivity metrics for prediction is mixed, while direct simulation approaches are computationally expensive and hard to generalize. Here we present a new approach for prediction based on emulation of a coupled Saint Venant equation-Richards equation model with random forest regression. The emulation model predicts infiltration and peak flow velocities for every location on a hillslope with an arbitrary spatial pattern of impermeable and permeable surfaces but fixed soil, slope, and storm properties. It provides excellent fidelity to the physically based model predictions and is generalizable to novel spatial patterns. The spatial pattern features that explain most of the hydrological variability are not stable across different soils, slopes, and storms, potentially explaining some of the difficulties associated with direct use of spatial metrics for predicting landscape function. Although the current emulator relies on strong assumptions, including smooth topography, binary permeability fields, and only a small collection of soils, slope, and storm scenarios, it offers a promising way forward for applications in dryland and urban settings and in supporting the development of potential connectivity indices.

We found complementary and substitutability linkages arising from jointness and endogeneity between the two technologies. Specifically, our findings reveal positive joint determination along with negative endogeneity between the two technologies indicating that, controlling for observable variables, both technologies are positively linked, but unobserved factors that affect one adoption decision are negatively correlated with the other. After controlling for jointness and endogeneity, we found significant complementarity linkages showing a significant positive effect of manure use on the adoption of modern seeds, which is also significantly and positively affected by the number of cash crops grown and remittances. The two technologies are reversely affected by schooling and the incidence of soil fertility problems within the farm, whereas the amount of healthy land has a positive effect on both. The study suggests that organic fertilizer can serve as an enabling factor for greater adoption of modern seeds, especially in less favourable climate areas, and strongly supports the argument behind the need to breed seeds suitable for the use of organic fertilizers. These findings provide avenues for re-orientation of policies that promote the use of modern seeds in dryland areas in sub-Saharan Africa, with a possibility of breeding and promoting them in packages with organic fertilizers to upscale their adoption.																			0165-0203	1477-8947				FEB	2019	43	1					41	55		10.1111/1477-8947.12163	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1477-8947.12163													WOS:000461372400004

Millsp.]	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.], a multipurpose and nutritious grain legume crop, is cultivated for its protein-rich seeds mainly in South Asia and Eastern and Southern Africa. In spite of large breeding efforts for pigeonpea improvement in India and elsewhere, genetic enhancement is inadequate largely due to its narrow genetic base and crop susceptibility to stresses. Wild Cajanus species are novel source of genetic variations for the genetic upgradation of pigeonpea cultivars. In the present study, 75 introgression lines (ILs), derived from crosses involving cultivated pigeonpea variety ICPL 87119 and wild Cajanus cajanifolius and Cajanus acutifolius from the secondary gene pool, were evaluated for yield and yield-attributing traits in diverse environments across locations and years. Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) analysis revealed large genetic variations for days to 50% flower, days to maturity, plant height, primary branches per plant, pods per plant, pod weight per plant, 100-seed weight, and grain yield per plant. Superior ILs with mid-early to medium maturity duration identified in this study are useful genetic resources for use in pigeonpea breeding. Additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) analysis unfolded large influence of environment and genotype x environment interaction for variations in yield. A few lines such as ICPL 15023 and ICPL 15072 with yield stability were identified, while a number of lines were completely resistant (0%) to sterility mosaic diseases and/or Fusarium wilt. These lines are novel genetic resources for broadening the genetic base of pigeonpea and bring yield stability and stress tolerance. High-yielding lines ICPL 15010, ICPL 15062, and ICPL 15072 have been included in the initial varietal trials (IVTs) of the All India Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) on pigeonpea for wider evaluation across different agro-ecological zones in India for possible release as variety(ies).

However, comprehensive assessments of how EENF affects CH4 and CO2 emissions from paddies and drylands and the associated benefits are lacking. Here, we present the results of a global meta analysis conducted to assess the above issues. Our results showed that, on average, applying nitrification inhibitors and coated controlled-release urea to paddy fields significantly decreased CH4 emissions by 24.0 % and 25.3 %, respectively, likely due to the weakened inhibition of NH4+ on CH4 oxidation. A similar effect on CO2 emission was observed when farmers used nitrification inhibitors and coated controlled-release urea in the drylands. The meta-analysis results revealed that all EENF products could help mitigate the global warming potential of paddies and drylands. After incorporating the benefit of global warming potential mitigation into the cost-benefit analysis, coated controlled-release urea application in paddies and drylands produced the largest environmental gains of $ 76.34 ha(-1) and $ 79.35 ha(-1), respectively. However, the relatively lower purchasing cost and larger yield increase of urease inhibitors resulted in the largest net profits for farmers. Moreover, a greater economic return was generally achieved by applying EENF to paddy fields than by applying EENF to drylands. These findings highlight the role of EENF in mitigating the global warming potential of global paddy and dryland fields, which has facilitated the comprehensive recognition of EENF-induced impacts.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				JAN 10	2024	907								168080	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168080	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168080		NOV 2023						37898212					WOS:001109891400001

The Golden Promise/Otis recombinant inbred line (RIL) population (MP-3, NSL 545640 MAP) consists of 190 F5:7 individuals. The parental lines exhibited significant differences in several agronomic traits including height, heading date, yield/plant, and lodging. Transgressive segregation in the RILs was evidenced by the broad range of values observed for these agronomic traits. The RIL population was genotyped using the Illumina 50k iSelect single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. Of the 10,810 polymorphic markers that were identified between the two parents, 4617 markers were used for generating a genetic map that spanned 4566 cM with an average distance of 1 cM between markers. The fact that Golden Promise is a malting cultivar developed in the United Kingdom, versus Otis, a feed barley bred in the United States for dryland cultivation, indicates that this population may be useful in identifying the genetic basis of many other traits. Heritage malting barley Golden Promise and feed cultivar Otis show extreme variation to abiotic stresses.A recombinant inbred line population of 190 lines was generated using Golden Promise and Otis.Transgressive segregation for several agronomic traits was observed in the RIL population.A genetic map with more than 4000 SNP markers was generated using this population.The seed of the RIL population and the genotyping data are freely available to other researchers.																			1936-5209	1940-3496				2023 OCT 29	2023										10.1002/plr2.20337	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/plr2.20337		OCT 2023											WOS:001093480100001

In this paper, Puding County, a typical karst county in southern China, was taken as the study area. The Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs model, and other models were used to reveal the spatial stratified heterogeneity and trade-off/synergy relationship of carbon storage, water conser-vation, soil conservation and net primary productivity. An optimal parameter geographic detector model was used to scientifically identify the drivers of the spatially stratified heterogeneity of the ESs. The research findings are as follows: (1) the carbon storage, WC, SC, and NPP increased by 16.72%, 162.81%, 145.55%, and 177.97%, respectively. (2) Ecosystem services supply was greater than 52% for both paddy fields and dryland. The hot spots of ESs were concentrated in the forest land area, and the cold spots were concentrated in the construction land, dry land, and paddy fields. (3) The water conservation and SC, as well as WC and CS, exhibited diminishing trade-offs. (4) The lithology, slope, annual precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration were the primary drivers affecting the ESs. The lithology & AND; potential evapotranspiration explained 37.48% of the spatial differ-entiation of the NPP, and the lithology & AND; annual precipitation explained 25.08% of the WC. The findings of this study provide scientific guidance for future efforts to support regional economic growth and the sustainable karst ecosystem development globally.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2023	154								110811	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110811	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110811		AUG 2023											WOS:001059163600001

However, it remains unclear whether loss-control urea blended with normal urea can reduce the environmental impact while maximizing N utilization.MethodsField experiments were conducted on summer maize fields in two regions of the North China Plain (Wenxian and Yuanyang) to assess N loss through NH3 volatilization and NO3--N leaching. Six treatments were implemented: no N fertilizer (CK), normal urea (U1), farmers' N practice (U2), and various blending ratios of loss-control and normal urea (CU1(7:3), CU2(5:5), CU3(3:7)).ResultsDaily NH3 fluxes peaked within 1 week after sowing, with most NH3 volatilization (> 90%) occurring in the first month after sowing. Compared with U, CU significantly reduced NH3 volatilization in Wenxian and Yuanyang. Application of CU reduced NO3--N residues in deeper soil layers by increasing NO3--N accumulation within the 40 cm soil layer. Among these, CU2 increased grain yield and NUE compared to U treatments. Comparatively, CU treatments contributed more to maize yield and had less effect on NH3 volatilization and deep soil NO3--N residues in the structural equation model.ConclusionsOur results highlighted that loss-control urea and normal urea blend ratio of 5:5 (CU2) achieved a win-win scenario in terms of crop productivity and ecosystem services and was recommended as the best N fertilizer application strategy for the sustainable production of dryland maize in the North China Plain.																			0032-079X	1573-5036				2023 MAY 9	2023										10.1007/s11104-023-06059-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-023-06059-7		MAY 2023											WOS:000984769700004

However, the DOM evolutionary signatures and the timing of equilibrium being achieved in dryland inter-planting systems remain unclear. This study aimed to determine the characteristics of DOM dynamics using a three-dimensional fluorescence excitation-emission matrix combined with parallel factor analysis (EEMs-PARAFAC). Methods DOM contents, different related components accumulation were assessed using clear tillage (CT) as the control, white clover (Trifolium repens L.) of three different ages (4, 8, 12 years), representing a chronosequence, in apple orchards on the Loess Plateau. Results At a depth of 0-10 cm, DOM concentration decreased with depth and significantly increased with longer inter-planting, and the five fluorescence components contents of soil DOM showed a similar trend. Moreover, the relative abundances of humic-like (C2, C3) was higher than CT, but the protein-like was lower. The ultraviolet-visible spectral and optical indices indicated that DOM mainly originated from mixed sources, and gradually tended towards greater DOM molecular complexity with increasing time since sowing. Microbial biomass nitrogen and soil organic carbon (SOC) were the most important two factors affecting DOM over time, contributing to 87% and 77% of the total variation. Conclusions This study demonstrated that inter-planting time and soil depth played important roles in determining DOM content and component accumulation. Overall, inter-planting with white clover in orchards can effectively improve the accumulation of macro-molecular humic-like DOM, which probably promotes SOC storage. Long-term experiments are required exploring DOM dynamics and the timing of equilibrium being reached.

Trait responses of a grassland shrub invader to altered moisture regimes	PLANT AND SOIL												Purpose We sought to identify plant traits important for initial establishment of a globally invasive shrub, Prosopis spp. (mesquite), by quantifying morphological and ecophysiological responses of seedlings to contrasting moisture regimes. Our model plant was Prosopis velutina, a prominent invader of North American semi-desert grasslands. Methods Seedlings received one of three watering levels corresponding to regional 'ambient' (100%), 'dry' (-65%; 65% reduction of ambient), and 'wet' (+165%; 65% increase above ambient) growing season precipitation regimes. A total of 32 plant performance (e.g., biomass and growth) and functional (e.g., morphological and physiological) traits were assessed when seedlings reached 11- and 22-days old. Results Germination under dry conditions was high (72%) and only slightly reduced compared to ambient and wet conditions with subsequent seedling survival unaffected. High trait variation enabled early recruitment over the range of soil moisture conditions, including extreme drought. Root volume, surface area, tips, tap root length, and leaf length functional traits were top predictors of seedling performance, with fresh weight, absolute growth rate, and root mass secondarily contributing to establishment. Conclusion No physiological functional traits were significant in predicting performance or discriminating between moisture regimes; suggesting morphological traits for maintaining metabolic and hydraulic function are key to early establishment. Dry conditions reduced germination and slowed P. velutina seedling growth but did not prevent early establishment. Thus, recruitment of certain dryland shrubs may not be episodic with respect to above-average rainfall. Indeed, early recruitment of P. velutina and functionally similar species can potentially occur even in moisture conditions well below-average.

Complex regional telecoupling between people and nature revealed via quantification of trans-boundary ecosystem service flows	PEOPLE AND NATURE												1. Quantifying and mapping trans-boundary ecosystem service (ES) flows can help identify dependencies and responsibilities for promoting economic development and environmental sustainability between nations, but few studies have focused on ES flows beyond national boundaries. 2. Our case-study region-Central Asia-hosts one of the largest dryland areas in the world, and this ecosystem is vulnerable to climate variability and anthropogenic impacts. Understanding ES supply, demand and flows is essential for supporting human wellbeing, livelihoods and economic development. 3. In this study, we mapped the supply, demand and flows of four ES including freshwater provision, food provision, carbon sequestration and cultural (recreation) services between the five Central Asian nations of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan for the year 2016. We quantified the spatial patterns in ES supply and demand at local and regional scales, driven by environmental heterogeneity and socio-economic development, and revealed complex telecoupling of ES flows between nations. Kazakhstan provided the greatest amount of ES to other countries, especially food provision and carbon sequestration, while Uzbekistan was the biggest ES beneficiary, especially from freshwater and food provision services. 4. Our analysis of trans-boundary ES flows helps to understand the complex telecoupling and rich interdependencies between people and nature between different countries. This information is essential for policy making to balance human and ecological needs, enhance the management of natural capital, and sustain ES provision in our metacoupled world.

Assessing the effectiveness of agricultural conservation practices in maintaining soil organic carbon under contrasting agroecosystems and a changing climate	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												The potential of conservation practices to maintain soil organic C (SOC) and reduce climate change impacts on yields is unknown. This study aimed to validate the DayCent model with observed yield data and the CQESTR model with measured SOC in two agroecosystems, and predict the best practices to sustain SOC under projected climate change. Data were from a conventional tillage (CT) wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow rotation without N or with 135 kg N ha(-1) fertilizer, and no-till (NT) experiments, NTA (NTA0W-F and NTA135W-F) and NTB with a wheat-pea (Pisum sativum L.) cover crop (NTB0W-P and NTB135W-P) in Oregon; and crop rotations with CT and NT silage or grain corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]-alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) with or without manure or stover removal or a cover crop in Pennsylvania. Measured and CQESTR-simulated SOC were significantly (p .0001) correlated (r = .90). In Oregon, predicted SOC to 60 cm increased under NTA135W-F and NTB135W-P at 0.05 and 0.08 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) under projected climate change, respectively. The NT management under dryland production provided a limited SOC increase. In Pennsylvania, predicted SOC to 1 m decreased at 0.07 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) in corn-soybean under CT or NT with stover removal, but increased by 0.71 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) in dairy forage NT and manure added under climate change. The responses of SOC to climate change were affected by management, biomass type, edaphic properties, local climate, and agroecosystem.

Selective herbicide control: using furrows and carbon seed coatings to establish a native bunchgrass while reducing cheatgrass cover	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Invasion by exotic grasses is degrading dryland ecosystems worldwide and efforts to restore native vegetation in invaded areas have been largely unsuccessful. Control of invasive grasses with herbicide also limits restoration efforts using native seed. In this study, we evaluated two approaches that could allow for the restoration of a native species Pseudoroegneria spicata while reducing an invasive annual grass Bromus tectorum with a herbicide mixture in the sagebrush steppe ecosystem (the United States). We used two methods to protect native seeds from herbicide: activated carbon was applied as a seed coating with the intent of absorbing the herbicide around the seed, and furrows were used to side-sweep soil sprayed with herbicide away from the planted seed. Our results indicate that imazapic + glyphosate herbicide application had a strong negative effect on the invasive annual grass, reducing B. tectorum cover 91% after 1 year, and 39% after 2 years. Herbicide also had strong negative effects on P. spicata without a carbon-coating or furrow treatment, reducing seedling emergence 38%, 2-year plant density 65%, and 2-year total growth 90%. Both activated carbon seed coatings and furrow treatments limited herbicide effects on P. spicata 2-year growth, but neither treatment alone mitigated herbicide effects on all life stages. Combining carbon coatings and furrow treatments mitigated harmful herbicide effects on several plant stages (seedling emergence, plant densities, and growth). Our results suggest that combining activated carbon coatings and furrow results in similar establishment of a native perennial as a non-herbicide seeding and lowers B. tectorum abundance.

J	Wang, L; Wang, L; Guo, ZH				Wang, L.; Wang, L.; Guo, Z-H			The complete chloroplast genome of Tamarix ramosissima and comparative analysis of Tamaricaceae species	BIOLOGIA PLANTARUM												Tamarix ramosissima is a deciduous shrub that resides in arid and semi-arid regions. Although of ecological and medicinal values, some Tamarix species are considered invasive as they have dominated the riparian zones of dryland in some parts of the world. Here, the complete chloroplast (cp) genome of T. ramosissima was sequenced and analyzed, showing a size of 156 150 bp and a GC content of 36.5 %. The plastome displayed a typical quadripartite structure, consisting of a pair of inverted repeat (IR) regions of 26 554 bp, separated by a large single copy (LSC) region of 84 795 bp, and a small single copy (SSC) region of 18 247 bp. The cp genome encoded 130 genes, including 85 proteincoding genes, 37 tRNA genes, and 8 rRNA genes. A total of 32 repeat sequences and 64 simple sequence repeat (SSR) were identified in the plastome, and an obvious A/T bias was observed in the majority of the SSRs detected. By comparing the T. ramosissima cp genome with those of the other four Tamaricaceae species, a number of divergence hotspots were identified among these plastomes. Together with SSRs and long repeats identified, these divergence hotspots could be developed as potential molecular markers facilitating species discrimination and evolutionary studies. Using plastome sequences, we re-investigated the phylogenetic relationship among 19 species, and T. ramosissima was found to be a sister of Tamarix chinensis. Taken together, our study provides valuable genomic resources to deepen the understanding of plant photosynthetic mechanism and phylogenomics.																			0006-3134	1573-8264					2021	65						237	245		10.32615/bp.2021.014	http://dx.doi.org/10.32615/bp.2021.014													WOS:000680471100001

Successful natural regeneration of mangroves after disturbance depends on the dispersal, establishment, early growth and survival of propagules. Focusing on the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve (MMFR) in Peninsular Malaysia, we investigated how the location of a mangrove forest patch might influence the early regeneration of mangroves after clear-felling events that regularly take place on an approximately 30-year rotation as part of local management. We used Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) annual time series from 1988 to 2015 to indicate the recovery of canopy cover during early regeneration, which was determined as the average time (in years) for the NDMI to recover to values associated with the mature forests prior to their clear felling. We found that clear-felled mangrove patches closer to water and/or to already established patches of Rhizophora regenerated more rapidly than those farther away. In contrast, patches located closer to dryland forests regenerated slower compared to patches that were farther away. The study concludes that knowledge of the distribution of water, hydro-period and vegetation communities across the landscape can indicate the likely regeneration of mangrove forests through natural processes and identify areas where active planting is needed. Furthermore, time-series comparisons of the NDMI during the early years of regeneration can assist monitoring of mangrove establishment and regeneration, inform on the success of replanting, and facilitate higher productivity within the MMFR.

Diverse managements have been considered as effective ways to restore degraded grassland, but it remains unclear how semi-arid grasslands respond to long-term grazing exclusion and fenced mowing. Here, a study was conducted under open grazing, grazing exclusion and fenced mowing in a semi-arid grassland on the Loess Plateau. We measured plant species composition and diversity, plant production, surface litter and soil water and carbon content. Shifts in grassland management led to significant divergence in plant community composition. Long-term grazing exclusion (35 years) significantly increased plant biomass, surface litter, soil water and carbon storage, but suppressed plant diversity compared to open grazing. Conversely, fenced mowing significantly increased plant diversity accompanying with a weak effect on soil carbon. Moreover, mowing significantly reduced surface litter and soil moisture, which have strong implications for nutrient depletion and soil drying. Our results suggest that introducing disturbances are necessary to safeguard biodiversity, and continuous mowing (5 years) belongs to over exploitation of the long-term protected grassland. Therefore, it is essential to optimize management with dual objectives of biodiversity and soil carbon sequestration in the future.

Through data collection and Nutrient Flows in Food chain, Environment and Resources Use (NUFER) and NUFER-AGD model, present study aimed to explore the spatial and temporal flows of nitrogen (N) in the cropping and animal farming systems of the YRB from 1999 to 2019; and to evaluate the developing status and restrictive factors for the green development in this area. The total N input of the area increased from 2.10 x 10(7) t in 1999-3.66 x 10(7) t in 2019, mainly originated from fertilizer (53%, 2019) and fodder (39%, 2019) input. The total N output increased from 8.27 x 10(6) t in 1999-13.77 x 10(6) t in 2019, and the main pathway of N loss was ammonia volatilization, accounting for 53.5% in 1999 and 53.1% in 2019 of the total losses. Based on the N input and loss per unit area in 2019, the upper reaches of the YRB were low-input and high-emission; the middle reaches were high-input and high-emission; the lower reaches were high-input and low-emission. Fifty variables of five dimensions, society development, economy growth, agricultural production, resources input and ecological environment were selected to assess whole YRB for the green development index, the results show that 36% variables reached the green level, and the parameters of the agricultural production and ecological environment among all variables were the key factors of limiting green development of the YRB area. These founding are of great importance to provide scientific support for sustainable agricultural development and ecological protection at regional scale.

However, little is known about how grass influences runoff hydraulics, soil erosion and headcut erosion processes. A series of rainfall and scouring experiments were conducted on four plots to elucidate the effect of the density of Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn (planting spaces: 20 x 20 cm(2), GA1; 15 x 15 cm(2), GA2; 10 x 10 cm(2), GA3; bare land as control, BL) on runoff hydraulics and soil erosion during gully headcut erosion. The velocity, Reynolds number (Re), runoff shear force (tau) and stream power (omega) of the BL increased exponentially with time (P < 0.01). However, for the grassland, most parameters increased linearly with time (P < 0.01). The Froude number (Fr) of the BL and grassland significantly decreased linearly and exponentially, respectively, with time (P < 0.01). For tau, the grass tableland needed to develop for a period of time to restrain it. The runoff of the BL tableland and gully head was supercritical turbulent, while that of the grassland was more dispersed. The existence of a gully head increased the jet velocity by 2.97%-67.19%, which increased the dispersion degree of the runoff. The runoff energy showed a significant exponential increase with time (P < 0.05). Compared with that of the BL, the energy consumption of the runoff from the grassland increased by 4.10%-31.81%. During gully headcut erosion, the BL was primarily cut down to the tableland by runoff, while the grassland was cut down to the headwall by on-wall flow. As the density increased, the benefit of sediment reduction increased, reaching a maximum of 66.79%. The collapse of the BL primarily occurred in the upper part of the headwall during the early experimental stage. The frequency and space-time ranges of the collapse of the grassland were larger than those of the BL. The gravity erosion types of the BL were headwall collapse and gully bank collapse, while those of the grasslands were headwall collapse and root-soil composite collapse.					chen, zhuoxin/ABH-4099-2020; Guo, Mingming/ABH-4307-2020	chen, zhuoxin/0000-0002-8673-0498; Guo, Mingming/0000-0002-4887-5688; Wang, Wen-Long/0000-0002-3594-3653; Guo, Wen-Zhao/0000-0002-6510-3719; Shi, Qianhua/0000-0001-9925-6679													0885-6087	1099-1085				AUG	2022	36	8							e14643	10.1002/hyp.14643	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14643													WOS:000833887600001

Community engagements under village administration should be the main strategy for supporting peatlands restoration. Since the new law on villages was enacted in 2014, the village has gained authority and delegated responsibilities from the upper-level government to make rural development decisions in various sectors, including those connected to environmental management, such as peatland restoration. The recognition of authority is followed by the transfer of significant funds, called village funds, from the central government as a form of commitment to undertake the village law. Currently, applied regulations allow community engagement to utilize the village fund for supporting peatland restoration. This study investigated the community's perceptions of village fund utilization for peatland restoration through in-depth interviews and questionnaires with site-level stakeholders that influence village budget allocation-related policies. The investigated aspects included village budgeting and development planning mechanism, the capacity of the community, and rules of district government in supervising the villages. Based on our findings, the identified challenges include the absence of environmental aspects as a part of village development pillars for developing village planning and budgeting, lack of community's environmental-economical nexus knowledge, and lack of district government in supervising village fund utilization and management at the site-level. However, the opportunities to direct the village fund utilization for peatlands restoration are widely open by strengthening the roles of district government to improve village fund governance at the site level.

Based on this paradigm, policies have been developed at various levels to support the most vulnerable family farmers. Nevertheless, given climate change projections in the region, there is a strong need for a better understanding of climate perceptions, their impact on production, and the adjustments undertaken, to identify the main vulnerabilities and adaptation processes that can be fostered by those policies. Based on this, through qualitative interviews, we aimed to understand the perception of these topics by 54 dryland family farmers in the sub medium Sao Francisco Region. In general, most interviewees reported perceptions of climate change over the past 15-20 years, as well as concerns about the future climate. The last drought (2011-2018) resulted in production losses, which mostly led to reactive adjustments to events. Given the statements, it was observed that there is a perception of the need for planning, so that adaptation alternatives prior to the impacts can be carried out. However, several challenges limit the development of a culture of adaptation, including those related to the use and limitations of public policies. Finally, it discusses the need to update some strategies promoted by the paradigm of Living with the Semiarid to incorporate the perspective of climate change and enable the increase in the adaptive capacities of family fanners so that they can anticipate events (adaptation ex-ante) and not just respond to its impacts (ex-post adaptation).																			1518-952X	2176-9109				DEC	2020	55				SI		599	618		10.5380/dma.v55i0.72974	http://dx.doi.org/10.5380/dma.v55i0.72974													WOS:000600017700029

Effects of long-term grazed crop and pasture systems under no-till on organic matter fractions and selected quality parameters of soil in the Overberg, South Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PLANT AND SOIL												There is limited soil research on semi-arid, grazed no-till crop and pasture systems. The long-term (10 years) effect of three grazed no-till dryland crop and pasture rotation systems, and perennial lucerne pasture were assessed on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks, soil organic matter functional pools and selected soil quality parameters in the Overberg, South Africa. The largest soil C and N stocks (0-30 cm) were found in crop-pasture systems containing wheat and medic/clover (70.2-74.9 Mg C ha(-1) and 8.3-8.4 Mg N ha(-1)), compared with perennial lucerne pasture (63.4 Mg C ha(-1) and 7.7 Mg N ha(-1)) or cropping-only systems (54.7-58.9 Mg C ha(-1) and 6.3-6.7 Mg N ha(-1)). Significantly higher labile C and N (free particulate organic matter fraction) contents were observed in crop-pasture systems (1.37-1.74 g C kg(-1) and 0.107-0.110 g N kg(-1)) than in continuous cropping systems (0.9-1.0 g C kg(-1) and 0.042-0.045 g N kg(-1)), attributed to higher annual C and N inputs and lower extent of soil disturbance. Significant positive correlations were found between soil C and N functional pools and soil quality parameters (soil respiration, effective cation exchange capacity and aggregate stability) and wheat yields.

Knowledge of water use characteristics among co-occurring plant species is crucial for understanding the ecohydrological processes and community assemblages. However, interspecific interactions with respect to water sources and physiological activity remain poorly understood.Methods The stable oxygen isotope values of xylem and soil water, and leaf physiological characteristics were measured in three communities in the Mu Us Desert, northwest China: a mixed shrub and grasses community; a pure shrub community; and a pure grasses community.Results In mixed communities, the main water source for shrubs shifted to deeper soil layers than in pure communities, whereas grass water use switched to shallower soil layers. Leaf photosynthetic rates, stomatal conductance, transpiration, and water potential of both species were significantly lower in mixed communities than in pure communities. These results suggest that interspecific interactions influenced plant water use patterns. The water-use efficiency of shrubs increased in mixed communities, whereas that of grasses decreased, indicating that grasses exacerbated water stress on shrubs, while shrubs relieved water stress on grasses. Additionally, leaf physiological activity was positively correlated with shallower water sources and negatively correlated with deeper water sources.Conclusion Our findings show that plants responded to interspecific interactions under drought conditions through the coupling of plant water sources with leaf physiologies. The present study provides important insights into water-related reforestation and ecological management in dryland ecosystems.																			0032-079X	1573-5036				2023 OCT 25	2023										10.1007/s11104-023-06346-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-023-06346-3		OCT 2023											WOS:001088851500003

However, the plant-plant interaction transition and its effects on soil physiochemical characteristics along soil phosphorus (P) levels are not clear. To address this issue, maize-grass pea intercropping system was used to investigate the variations in plant-plant facilitation along soil P gradients (low- to high-P) and their effects on rhizosphere soil N and P availability and microbial biomass. The data showed that total net effect (NE) was always positive, indicating facilitative effects of intercropping on total community productivity. Specifically, the relative yield (RY) for both species was greater than 0.5 in the P-deficient soils, representing mutually facilitated effects. Yet, under the P-sufficient condition, maize and grass pea acted as facilitated species and facilitator respectively. Rhizosphere phosphatase activity was significantly enhanced in the P-deficient soils, accordingly fostering P mineralization for higher P availability and N utilization. The contents of microbial biomass carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus (i.e., MBC, MBN and MBP) were evidently elevated in intercropping systems than those of mono-culture. Also, global meta-analysis verified above phenomenon, showing that high P addition decreased facilitation intensity with type shift, regarding plant productivity, N and P utilization and vice versa. We confirmed a relatively full picture of P-driven facilitation intensity and type shift along stress gradients by field observation and meta-analysis. The findings provided a new insight of biodiversity in soil physiochemical traits and also revealed a critical mechanism affecting resource utilization in the P-limited soils.																			0167-1987	1879-3444				OCT	2023	234								105867	10.1016/j.still.2023.105867	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2023.105867		AUG 2023											WOS:001069332700001

However, the impacts of these two strategies on the microbe-driven CO2 emissions in saline-alkaline soils are not yet clear. Therefore, a 150-day incubation experiment was conducted in this study to evaluate the short-term effects of water regulation and the addition of organic matter with different characteristics on CO2 emissions and microbial community characteristics in saline-alkali soils under non-flooding conditions. This study was conducted at two water saturations, i.e., 50% WFPS and 80% WFPS. In addition, five organic matter treatments were conducted: CK: control; N: urea; SN: Straw + urea; SNH: Straw + urea + microbial agent; and SNB: Straw + urea + biochar. The results demonstrated that compared with 50% WFPS, 80% WFPS significantly increased cumulative CO2 emission by 27.66%, but significantly decreased salt content and the fungal Chao1 and Shannon indices. The application of the biochar and microbial agent decreased the cumulative CO2 emissions of the SN treatment by 27.39% and 14.92%, respectively. When sufficient carbon supply is available, the decrease in fungal diversity may reduce CO2 emission. The findings demonstrated that SNH and SNB at 80% WFPS might decrease CO2 emissions under straw carbon intake as well as the loss of labile organic carbon (LOC). Additionally, these treatments can alleviate microbial stress caused by salinity, which has a favorable impact on enhancing carbon storage in salinity-affected dryland soils.

Arthropods are key for ecological functioning in semi-arid ecosystems. However, few studies have assessed the role that heuweltjies play in maintaining arthropod diversity in the landscape. This study investigates how arthropod abundance, species richness, beta-diversity and composition respond to heuweltjies at multiple spatial scales (biotope and site). Two sampling techniques (pitfall and vacuum sampling) were used to collect epigaeic (ground) and foliage-dwelling arthropods on heuweltjies and in the surrounding matrix, at three different sites in the Succulent Karoo during drought conditions. Heuweltjies had greater epigaeic and foliage alpha-diversity and abundance than the matrix. Addi-tionally, epigaeic and foliage arthropod community composition were dissimilar at both the biotope and site scales. Beta diversity across the three sites was high and driven by species turnover. At the biotope scale, heu-weltjie and matrix plots both showed high beta-diversity. This study took place during a prolonged drought with high plant mortality and relatively few foliage arthropods, but patterns in arthropod diversity between heuweltjies and the surrounding matrix were nevertheless still apparent. These results suggest that heuweltjies promote arthropod diversity and heterogeneity in the landscape, playing a vital role as refuges, providing food and nesting resources for various arthropod species.

Field measurement of wind erosion flux and soil erodibility factors as affected by tillage and seasonal drought	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												During periods of no or low crop growth in dryland cropping systems, tillage can reduce residue coverage and thereby elevate wind erosion risk. We measured wind erosion on a silt loam, Haplustoll soil in North Dakota (456 mm precipitation yr(-1)) in response to levels of tillage applied once in spring during fallow following a small grain-sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) rotation. Treatments were no-tillage (NT), one-pass tandem disk tillage (TDT), and two-pass offset disk tillage (ODT). Erosion flux was measured with sediment samplers near peripheries of >1-ha replicated plots from May through September 2003 and 2004. Soil losses in ODT, TDT, and NT were 12.0, 4.8, and 2.1 Mg ha(-1), respectively, in 2003 and 2.6, 1.6, and 1.4 Mg ha(-1) in 2004. The greatest loss, 12.0 Mg ha(-1), was equivalent to 1-mm soil depth. The two- to fivefold greater erosion in 2003, a year with 2 mo of <30% of average precipitation, appears linked to a decline in residue coverage. Coverage remained about the same in NT and increased in tilled treatments during 2004 with more average precipitation. Our measurements of wind erosion have shown how the residue-destroying effects of a single tillage event can be considerably exacerbated by a moderate, seasonal drought. This indicates the critical importance of NT for limiting soil and residue disturbance and reducing wind erosion risk from drought-affected plant growth failure in semiarid cropping systems.

L-Band Microwave Satellite Data and Model Simulations Over the Dry Chaco to Estimate Soil Moisture, Soil Temperature, Vegetation, and Soil Salinity	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												The Dry Chaco in South America is a semi-arid ecoregion prone to dryland salinization. In this region, we investigated coarse-scale surface soil moisture (SM), soil temperature, soil salinity, and vegetation, using L-band microwave brightness temperature (T-B) observations and retrievals from the soil moisture ocean salinity (SMOS) and soil moisture active passive satellite missions, Catchment land surface model (CLSM) simulations, and in situ measurements within 26 sampled satellite pixels. Across these 26 sampled pixels, the satellite-based SM outperformed CLSM SM when evaluated against field data, and the forward L-band T-B simulations derived from in situ SM and soil temperature performed better than those derived from CLSM estimates when evaluated against SMOS T-B observations. The surface salinity for the sampled pixels was on average only 4 mg/g and only locally influenced the T-B simulations, when including salinity in the dielectric mixing model of the forward radiative transfer model (RTM) simulations. To explore the potential of retrieving salinity together with other RTM parameters to optimize T-B simulations over the entire Dry Chaco, the RTM was inverted using 10 years of multiangular SMOS T-B data and constraints of CLSM SM and soil temperature. However, the latter modeled SM was not sufficiently accurate and factors such as open surface water were missing in the background constraints, so that the salinity retrievals effectively represented a bulk correction of the dielectric constant, rather than salinity per se. However, the retrieval of vegetation, scattering albedo, and surface roughness resulted in realistic values.

Particularly vulnerable are phreatophytic plants from groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) in regions that have to face water regime alterations due to the impacts of climate and land-use changes. Methods We investigated two aspects related to the water-use strategy of a keystone species that dominates one of the few terrestrial GDEs in European drylands (Ziziphus lotus): where it obtains water and how it regulates its use. We (1) evaluated plants' water sources and use patterns using a multiple-isotope approach (delta H-2, delta O-18, and Delta C-13); (2) assessed the regulation of plant water potential by characterizing the species on an isohydric-anisohydric continuum; and (3) evaluated plants' response to increasing water stress along a depth-to-groundwater (DTGW) gradient by measuring foliar gas exchange and nutrient concentrations. Results Ziziphus lotus behaves as a facultative or partial phreatophyte with extreme anisohydric stomatal regulation. However, as DTGW increased, Z. lotus (1) reduced the use of groundwater, (2) reduced total water uptake, and (3) limited transpiration water loss while increasing water-use efficiency. We also found a physiological threshold at 14 m depth to groundwater, which could indicate maximum rooting length beyond which optimal plant function could not be sustained. Conclusions Species such as Z. lotus survive by squandering water in drylands because of a substantial groundwater uptake. However, the identification of DTGW thresholds indicates that drawdowns in groundwater level would jeopardize the functioning of the GDE.

J	Liu, XF; Feng, XM; Fu, BJ				Liu, Xianfeng; Feng, Xiaoming; Fu, Bojie			Changes in global terrestrial ecosystem water use efficiency are closely related to soil moisture	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE), defined as the ratio between gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET), is an indicator of the tradeoff between carbon assimilation and water loss that is controlled by climate and ecosystem structure. However, how GPP and ET impact WUE remains poorly understood. In this study, we provide a global analysis of WUE trends front 1982 to 2011 using multi-model ensemble mean WUE values derived from seven process-based carbon cycle models and investigate the relative effects of leaf area index (LAI), soil moisture (5M), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) on GPP and ET. Increasing WUE trend was derived for all models, with an average rate of 0.0057 +/- 0.0018 g C.kg(-1)H(2)O.yr(-1) (p = 0.00), with a spatially increasing WUE across -84% of the global land area, and increasing trends which are statistically significant over similar to 72% (p < 0.05). Spatially, GPP primarily dominated WUE variability in humid regions, i.e., boreal Eurasia, eastern America, and the tropics, whereas ET dominated WUE variability in dryland regions, i.e., northeast China, the Middle East, southern South America, and South Australia. Soil moisture is likely the most influential factor on GPP and ET variations, with similar to 63% and similar to 61% of the global land area dominated by SM, and therefore WUE, for GPP and ET respectively from 1982 to 2011. Our findings enrich the understanding of WUE trends and provide direct evidence for SM-induced variability in WUE. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the extensive dieback on shrubs as a result of climatic changes or soil drought may impair shrub plantations' ecosystem functions in arid and semi-arid regions. In this study, we sampled brown C. korshinskill plantations (shrub dieback > 90%), green plantations (shrub dieback was rarely < 10%) and an over-100 years' natural grassland as the reference. The changes in plant biomass and diversity of understory vegetation, soil water storage (SWS) and carbon storage (SOCs) across of 0-10 m soil profile were analyzed. The results showed that, (i) the understory herbaceous biomass in brown plantations was 134.1 g m  2 and significantly higher by 49.5% than green plantations. The biomass and diversity of perennial forbs and annual/biennial grasses in brown plantations was also increased significantly; (ii) shrub dieback replenished soil water within 1-5 m depth. The SWS under brown plantations was significantly increased by 44.6% compared with green plantations, and reached 84.7% of that in natural grassland; (iii) the SOCs was notably higher in shrub plantations in the 0-10 m soil profile, increasing by 6.68% and 10.3% compared with natural grassland, respectively. SOC accumulation was mostly occurred at depths below 5 m under brown plantations. Overall, beyond shrub dieback, ecosystem functions of plantations were enhanced unexpectedly. The findings suggest that it was a blessing in shrub dieback disguise, understory herbaceous vegetation may maintain ecosystem functions of plantations in the semi-arid region alternatively.																			0378-1127	1872-7042				OCT 1	2023	545								121267	10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121267	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121267		JUL 2023											WOS:001050738900001

Methods To create a conceptual model representing the quality of life of low-income people with type 2 diabetes in the Philippines, 117 low-income adult participants in a public support group were studied, and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores on quality of life (QOL) were analyzed in terms of their relationships with the following factors: basic attributes, physical factors (glycated hemoglobin level, complications, comorbidities, and symptoms), social factors (support, education, and financial status), and cognitive factors (knowledge, attitude, self-efficacy, and self-management behavior). Results Based on correlation coefficients among variables and goodness-of-fit test results through a path analysis, 2 models representing causal relationships were created, both of which showed sufficient goodness-of-fit. Conclusion Glycated hemoglobin levels, knowledge of blood glucose levels, self-efficacy, and self-management behavior (exercise) influenced PCS scores, while age, glycated hemoglobin levels, neuropathy, knowledge of insulin, self-efficacy, and self-management behavior (exercise) influenced MCS scores. The influence of self-efficacy was prominent in both cases, providing an important insight for healthcare professionals to develop effective support methods.

Ravi Kanth			Feeding value of sorghum stover fed to tropical hair sheep as complete rations in chop, mash, pellet, and block forms	VETERINARY WORLD												Background and Aim: Poor palatability, low bulk density, and low nutritive value restrict the utilization of the crop residues as animal feeds. Altering the physical characteristics of feed by blending the roughage and concentrates in the form of complete feed improves the nutrient use efficiency and reduces the feed wastage, feed cost, and labor cost. The study aims to determine suitable processing methods (mash, pellet, or block forms) for efficient utilization of sorghum stover-based complete rations vis-a-vis conventional feeding methods in sheep. Materials and Methods: The sorghum stover was incorporated in complete rations with roughage to concentrate ratio of 50:50 proportion in a growth trial of 120 days. The feed ingredients were chaffed, ground in a hammer mill, passed through expander-extruder, and compressed by feed block machine to prepare chop, mash, pellet, and block form of rations, respectively. Twenty-four male intact growing NellorexDeccani cross lambs (3.5 +/- 0.5 months age, 14.50 +/- 0.41 kg (mean +/- SD) at the start of the experiment) were divided into four experimental groups of six animals each in a complete randomized design. The experimental rations were randomly allotted to each group and evaluated for their intake, nutrient utilization, and growth performance. Results: The sheep fed on pellet-based ration consumed a higher (p<0.05) quantity of dry matter. The digestibility coefficients of organic matter, crude protein, and neutral detergent fiber were higher (p<0.05) in processed rations (mash, pellet, or block). Further, the nitrogen balance (g/d) was higher (p<0.05) in the mash, pellet, and block form of rations, compared to chopped ration. The processing method did not influence calcium or phosphorous balance parameters, except for their urinary losses, which showed an increasing trend (p=0.07). The ram lambs fed with pelleted ration showed higher (p<0.05) weight gain than mash, block, or chaff forms. The efficiency of feed utilization in gaining one kg body weight was higher (p<0.05) in lambs fed a pelleted diet. Feeding pelletized ration was more economical to gain one kg body weight. The bulk density was highest for block-based ration followed by pellet, mash, and conventional rations, and the carrying capacity of truck was highest with the least transport cost in block-form of rations. Conclusion: Physical processing (mash, pellet, and block) of sorghum stover-based complete rations increased the nutrient utilization and growth performance of sheep compared to conventional chopped form. Pelleting the mash with expander extruder procedure was found to be more profitable. Nevertheless, the cost economics revealed blocks as more preferable forms for transporting the complete rations to larger distances.

AM fungal Here, we designed an elevation gradient experiment, which covered six elevations and three vegetation types, and collected plant and soil samples. We used Illumina gene sequencing to analyze AM fungal diversity in roots and rhizosphere soils; other potential factors, such as plant diversity, leaf C, N, and P, litter, soil and microbial biomass, extracellular enzymes activity, and the bacterial and ITS broad-fungal diversity, were also determined. We found that AM fungal diversity differences between root and rhizosphere soil diminished as elevation increased, despite that AM fungal diversity had a well-known pattern with elevation (unimodal patterns). Compared with plant characteristics, soil properties (soil C, N, P, C:N, C:P, N:P) were stronger effect on AM fungal diversity between root and rhizosphere. Particularly, soil extracellular enzymes activity and bacterial and ITS broad-fungal diversity explained more variation in AM fungal diversity dynamics along the elevation gradients. Our findings indicate that the diminishment of AM fungal diversity in root and rhizosphere soil are a response to elevation gradients through changes of soil extracellular enzymes activity and the bacterial and fungi communities, which provided evidence that AM fungal community dynamics link to climate change.

Differential drought resistance strategies of co-existing woodland species enduring the long rainless Eastern Mediterranean summer	TREE PHYSIOLOGY												In anticipation of a drier climate and to project future changes in forest dynamics, it is imperative to understand species-specific differences in drought resistance. The objectives of this study were to form a comprehensive understanding of the drought resistance strategies adopted by Eastern Mediterranean woodland species, and to elaborate specific ecophysiological traits that can explain the observed variation in survival among these species. We examined leaf water potential (Psi), gas exchange and stem hydraulics during 2-3 years in mature individuals of the key woody species Phillyrea latifolia L., Pistacia lentiscus L. and Quercus calliprinos Webb that co-exist in a dry woodland experiencing similar to 6 rainless summer months. As compared with the other two similarly functioning species, Phillyrea displayed considerably lower Psi (minimum Psi of -8.7 MPa in Phillyrea vs -4.2 MPa in Pistacia and Quercus), lower Psi at stomatal closure and lower leaf turgor loss point (Psi(TLP)), but reduced hydraulic vulnerability and wider safety margins. Notably, Phillyrea allowed Psi to drop below Psi(TLP) under severe drought, whereas the other two species maintained positive turgor. These results indicate that Phillyrea adopted a more anisohydric drought resistance strategy, while Pistacia and Quercus exhibited a more isohydric strategy and probably relied on deeper water reserves. Unlike the two relatively isohydric species, Phillyrea reached complete stomatal closure at the end of the dry summer. Despite assessing a large number of physiological traits, none of them could be directly related to tree mortality. Higher mortality was observed for Quercus than for the other two species, which may result from higher water consumption due to its 2.5-10 times larger crown volume. The observed patterns suggest that similar levels of drought resistance in terms of survival can be achieved via different drought resistance strategies. Conversely, similar resistance strategies in terms of isohydricity can lead to different levels of vulnerability to extreme drought.

Through an analysis of the kinematic principle of the structure and the establishment of the kinematic model, computer-aided analysis software was developed using Visual Basic 6.0. Consequently, a set of structural parameter values satisfying the target trajectory was derived employing the human-computer interaction method, and the 3D model was designed. The model was imported into Adams for kinematic simulation, and the seedling picking mechanism's trajectory during the operation was obtained through simulation. Modal analysis of the model was performed using Ansys, and the first six-order modal vibration patterns and modal frequencies of the seedling picking mechanism were obtained under the simulated working environment. The results confirmed that no resonance occurred during the operation. Comparisons of the seedling picking needle trajectory with the idle test revealed that the theoretical, simulated, and test trajectories were approximately identical. This proved the reliability of the theoretical design of the seedling picking mechanism, the machining of the parts, and the test bench construction. The success rates of seedling picking were 97.66, 96.09, 93.75, and 90.63% at 90, 100, 110, and 120 plants/min, respectively, with rates of substrate damage of 4.43%, 6.73%, 9.57%, and 14.37%, respectively. Thus, the experimental results confirmed that the operating parameters of the cam-linked planetary gear system seedling picking mechanism satisfied the design requirements.																				2077-0472				APR	2023	13	4							810	10.3390/agriculture13040810	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13040810													WOS:000978438700001

Cully			Establishment and Persistence of Trees Growing in the Channel of an Intermittent Stream in a Temperate, Karst Environment	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Trees, mostly sycamore (Platanus occidentalis L.), are growing in the channel of the lower 7 km of Sinking Creek in the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia. Sinking Creek is a gravel-bedded stream that disappears into a subsurface cave network and for its lower 7 km, flows intermittently throughout the year, exposing a dry streambed. We hypothesize that there have been low-flow periods in the past conducive to tree-seedling establishment. We describe this system and test our hypothesis through an analysis of hydrologic, dendrochronological, and geomorphic data to better understand the conditions leading to tree establishment and persistence in the stream channel. To our knowledge, this is the first study on trees growing in the channel of an intermittent stream in a temperate environment. Most riparian vegetation studies along intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams focus on dryland areas, where trees have also been observed growing in the channel. Our results show that sycamores are the oldest trees in the channel, that they established during periods of low precipitation, and they are located at the upstream end of bars. In their wake, on bars, other younger trees have established. Analysis of tree roots suggest that scour of the base of some trees occurred during thalweg migration.

Cyanobacterial Soil Crust Responses to Rainfall and Effects on Wind Erosion in a Semiarid Environment, Australia: Implications for Landscape Stability	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Cyanobacterial biocrusts (CBCs) perform a range of functions including early successional colonization of substrates, modification of soil properties, surface stabilization and carbon sequestration. The response of CBCs to hydration is well-constrained for cultured or single-species but less so for in situ communities and there are few studies of CBC response to, and impact on, wind erosion. This paper investigates the in situ response of dryland CBCs to rainfall and wind erosion using biological and physical indicators. Field sites are in central Australia in three geomorphic situations - sand dune, nebkha and claypan. Results indicate higher amounts of rainfall trigger a more intense biological response than lower amounts, but not one of longer duration. The intensity of photosynthetic response to rainfall appears related to air temperature. The relationship between CBC and soil loss by wind erosion is inconclusive, but saltation efficiency (Qs/Q) is highest on the dune and claypan when tested 48 hr after applying 5 mm of rainfall. This is attributed to rainfall detachment of sand particles increasing the availability of loose erodible material on the surface. The results highlight the rapid biological response of CBCs to rainfall events (within hours), and the importance of overall environmental conditions, such as air temperature, but raise questions as to the longevity of the biological impact of such response. Drought-affected CBCs can protect the surface against wind erosion but dehydration may reduce resilience to disturbance and, under predicted future climate scenarios, the protective role of cyanobacterial crusts may be compromised.

Strategies of desiccation tolerance vary across life phases in the moss <i>Syntrichia caninervis</i>	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												PREMISE: Desiccation tolerance (DT) is a widespread phenomenon among land plants, and variable ecological strategies for DT are likely to exist. Using Syntrichia caninervis, a dryland moss and model system used in DT studies, we hypothesized that DT is lowest in juvenile (protonemal) tissues, highest in asexual reproductive propagules (gemmae), and intermediate in adults (shoots). We tested the long-standing hypothesis of an inherent constitutive strategy of DT in this species. METHODS: Plants were rapidly dried to levels of equilibrating relative humidity (RHeq) ranging from 0 to 93%. Postrehydration recovery was assessed using chlorophyll fluorescence, regeneration rates, and visual tissue damage. For each life phase, we estimated the minimum rate of drying (RoD(min)) at RHeq = 42% that did not elicit damage 24 h postrehydration. RESULTS: DT strategy varied with life phase, with adult shoots having the lowest RoD(min) (10-25 min), followed by gemmae (3-10 h) and protonema (14-20 h). Adult shoots exhibited no detectable damage 24 h postrehydration following a rapid-dry only at the highest RHeq used (93%), but when dried to lower RHs the response declined to <50% of control fluorescence values. Notably, immediately following rehydration (0 h postrehydration), shoots were damaged below control levels of fluorescence regardless of the RHeq, thus implicating damage. CONCLUSIONS: Life phases of the moss S. caninervis had a range of strategies from near constitutive (adult shoots) to demonstrably inducible (protonema). A new response variable for assessing degree of DT is introduced as the minimum rate of drying from which full recovery occurs.

The reproductive and seed filling periods are the most sensitive to heat stress, resulting in limited yield and nutritional quality. Climate change causes frequent incidents of heat stress for global food crop production. This study aimed to assess the impact of high temperature during the reproductive stage of lentil on grain yield, nutritional value, and cooking quality. Thirty-six lentil genotypes were evaluated under controlled conditions for their high temperature response. Genotypic variation was significant (p < 0.001) for all the traits under study. High temperature-induced conditions reduced protein, iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) concentrations in lentils. Under heat stress conditions, mineral concentrations among lentil genotypes varied from 6.0 to 8.8 mg/100 g for Fe and from 4.9 to 6.6 mg/100 g for Zn. Protein ranged from 21.9 to 24.3 g/100 g. Cooking time was significantly reduced due to high temperature treatment; the range was 3-11 min, while under no stress conditions, cooking time variation was from 5 to 14 min. Phytic acid variation was 0.5-1.2 g/100 g under no stress conditions, while under heat stress conditions, phytic acid ranged from 0.4 to 1.4 g/100 g. All genotypes had highly significant bioavailable Fe and moderately bioavailable Zn under no stress conditions. Whereas under heat stress conditions, Fe and Zn bioavailability was reduced due to increased phytic acid levels. Our results will greatly benefit the development of biofortified lentil cultivars for global breeding programs to generate promising genotypes with low phytic acid and phytic acid/micronutrient ratio to combat micronutrient malnutrition.

However, the distribution and stability of CC in forest soils along a climatic gradient remain largely unclear, hindering our understanding and the accurate prediction of biogeochemical cycles in forest ecosystems in a changing world. To address these uncertainties, we measured CC and nitrogen (N) concentrations and mineralization of CC in soils from broad-leaved and coniferous forests along a wide-ranging climatic gradient in China and related these to experimental N addition and climatic conditions. An 85-day incubation was conducted under 25 degrees C and 60% of soil moisture at field capacity to determine the mineralization of soil CC. We hypothesized that the concentrations of CC and N would be higher but the mineralization of CC would be lower in soils from colder and drier forests and that the mineralization would be positively responsive to N addition. In support of these hypotheses, the concentrations of CC and N decreased, while the mineralization of CC measured under standard laboratory condition increased, with mean annual precipitation (MAP) and temperature (MAT). These metrics were not affected by forest type or the interaction between forest type and site. Nitrogen addition increased the cumulative mineralized CC (C-m, g kg(-1)) by 6-67%, and the effects varied with site and soil depth, but were similar between the broad-leaved and coniferous forests. The C-m decreased with increasing soil CC concentration, C/N ratio and mineral N, while the rate constant of CC mineralization (k, day(-1))showed opposite relationships with these metrics. The addition of N did not change the slopes of the relationships of C-m and k with the C/N ratio, MAP, and MAT; however, it strengthened the negative relationship of C-m with CC and mineral N concentrations. The results from this study suggested that the mineralization of CC was limited by N availability in the studied forested soils, and the response of CC mineralization to N addition was independent of climatic conditions.

Under drought conditions, fungicide seed coating does not increase emergence of two native grass species in sagebrush stands of the Intermountain West, USA	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Coating seeds with amendments to increase germination, emergence, and establishment is a promising strategy for dryland restoration. Seed coatings containing fungicides offer a potential solution in regions where fungal pathogens cause seed mortality during the winter stratification period between late fall seeding and spring germination. The effectiveness of the fungicide treatment, however, may be dictated by weather and within-site microenvironment. We tested how fungicide coating influenced seedling emergence of native grasses within sagebrush stands by planting untreated seeds and seeds coated (encrusted) with and without active fungicide ingredients in furrows that extended from the canopy edge of sagebrush plants (Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis) into the interspace. This was replicated at four sites across the Intermountain West in two successive years. We planted two native grasses, bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides) and bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata). Emergence was extremely low in both years, with a complete seeding failure (i.e. zero emergence) at two sites in the first year and three sites in the second year. At one site where emergence was sufficient for statistical analysis: (1) the coating on the fungicide and blank treatments inhibited emergence under anomalously dry conditions and (2) across seed treatments, proximity to a sagebrush canopy slightly increased seedling emergence. The variable emergence patterns across sites and years (i.e. the highest emergence was for the site-year combination with the lowest precipitation) highlight the sensitivity of seeding outcomes to, and dependence of fungicide seed coatings on, site conditions, and the necessity of repeating experiments across different weather years.

Soil and Vegetative Carbon Sequestration in Khuran Estuary Mangroves, Strait of Hormoz, During the Last 18 Centuries	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												The present paper, for the first time, estimates the amount of soil and vegetative blue carbon (C) sequestered in Khuran mangrove, Iran's largest mangrove forest along the Persian Gulf coasts. Cores were retrieved down to parental materials in 32 stations to achieve whole-soil C stock. A radiocarbon dating was also used to estimate sediment accretion and C sequestration rates during the last 18 centuries. Results indicated that soils and mangrove trees of the Khuran store a total of 16.79 Tg C (equivalent to similar to 60 Tg of CO2), 98.8% of which (16.59 Tg C) is sequestered in mangrove soils. During the last couple of thousand years, 8967 Mg C year(-1) (one Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) has been stored in mangrove soils of the area. Mean whole-soil C stock in Khamir and Qeshm is 1076 and 2134 Mg C ha(-1), respectively. A total of 5181 Gg C and 201 Gg C is stored in the top 1 m of soil and mangrove trees, respectively, 76% of which is sequestered in QM. Our results also indicate that mangroves located in desert and dryland coasts can store comparable quantities of belowground C than their tropical counterparts. High phytoplankton concentration and accreting mangrove high organic C content soils on their own accumulated peat in response to sea-level rise have possibly caused Khuran desert mangroves to store large amounts of C in their sediments. Our estimates suggest that probable complete deforestation of Khuran mangrove could lead to 8.14 Tg CO2 equivalent emissions.

Carbon dioxide flush as a soil health indicator related to soil properties and crop yields	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Carbon dioxide flush after rewetting of dried soils has been recommended as a promising soil health indicator, but it has not been related to most soil properties and crop yields. We evaluated the effect of cropping systems and N fertilization on CO2 flushes at 1- (1dC) and 4-d incubations (4dC) after rewetting of dried soils and related to 54 soil physical, chemical, and biological properties and annualized crop yields in two long-term experimental sites in eastern Montana (USA). Treatments included till and no-till spring wheat (Triticum aestiveum L.), pea (Pisum sativum L.), and fallow rotations with and without N fertilization. Carbon dioxide flushes were lower in till crop-fallow than in no-till continuous cropping systems at both sites. The 1dC was correlated to 5 soil physical, 7 chemical, and 12 biological properties, and 4dC was correlated to 9 physical, 8 chemical, and 11 biological properties in Froid. In Sidney, 1dC was correlated to 10 physical, 13 chemical, and 9 biological properties, and 4dC was correlated to 7 physical, 11 chemical, and 2 biological properties (1-8 moderately, 18-21 strongly, and 1-3 very strongly related). Carbon dioxide flushes were also related to mean annualized crop yields in both sites, except for the relationship between 4dC and crop yield in Sidney. Because of its stronger relationship with soil properties and crop yields, 1dC after rewetting of dried soils determined by using the infrared gas analyzer can be used as a simple, rapid, reliable, and inexpensive indicator of measuring soil health in dryland cropping systems.

This study examines the role of a rhizospheric bacterial isolate Kosakonia pseudosacchari TCPS-4 isolated from cluster bean plant (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba) under dryland condition. The low-cost media engineering was evaluated, and the phosphate-solubilizing and IAA-producing abilities of Kosakonia pseudosacchari TCPS-4 were improved using a hybrid statistical tool viz. Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA). Further, the effect of carbon and nitrogen media constituents and their interactions on IAA production and phosphate solubilization were also confirmed by a single-factor experiment assay. This revealed that MOGA-based model depicted 47.5 mg/L inorganic phosphate as the highest phosphate concentration in media containing 45 g/L carbon source, 12 g/L nitrogen source and 0.20 g/L MgSO4. The highest IAA production was 18.74 mg/L in media containing 45 g/L carbon source, 12 g/L nitrogen source and 0.2 g/L MgSO4. These values were also confirmed and measured by the experiments with phosphate solubilization of 45.71 mg/L and IAA production of 18.71 mg/L with 10(12) cfu/mL. This concludes that effective media engineering using these statistical tools can enhance the phosphate and IAA production by each model. A good correlation between measured and predicted values of each model confirms the validity of both responses. The present study gives an insight on media engineering for phosphate and IAA production by Kosakonia pseudosacchari TCPS-4.

Economic analyses of implemented tailwater recovery systems in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley	SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Tailwater recovery (TWR) systems are being implemented on agricultural landscapes to reduce nutrient loss and save water on the landscape for irrigation. These systems are a large financial investment for both the United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA NRCS) and private producers with total costs ranging from $400,000 to 900,000. Although economic analyses of TWR systems have been modeled, analyses of implemented TWR systems have yet to be completed. Economic studies are necessary to guide adaptive management of conservation funding for appropriation in methods with the greatest return. Therefore, an analysis was conducted on the costs and benefits of TWR systems by first comparing net present value (NPV) and benefit-to-cost ratios (BCR) of operation scenarios with and without TWR systems, as well as, with and without sediment reduction benefits. Second, the impact of the level of USDA NRCS financial assistance on NPV was evaluated. Three discount rates of 3, 7, and 10% were used on both rented and owned land schemes. Five TWR system scenarios were used in the investigation including dryland, irrigated, irrigation improvements, TWR systems, and TWR systems with external benefits of sediment loss mitigation. NPV and BCRs were positive and greater than one for TWR systems if producers owned the land but remained negative or less than one if land was rented. Beyond improvements to irrigation infrastructure, farms with a TWR system installed lost NPV of $51 to $328 per ha. Therefore, TWR systems are not considered to be economically viable when land is not owned.																			2363-5037	2363-5045				JUN	2019	5	2					901	919		10.1007/s40899-018-0266-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40899-018-0266-0													WOS:000465641000038

Biocrusts are also crucial in dryland ecosystems and play important roles in regulating soil carbon cycling. However, it is unclear how biocrusts mediate the effects of rainfall pulses on soil respiration. Using continuous field monitoring, we explored whether and how different types of biocrusts (including cyanobacteria-, lichen-and moss-dominated biocrusts) modulate the effects of precipitation on soil respiration under drying-rewetting cycles at event and seasonal scales. We found that soil respiration was induced after rainfall pulses, especially at different types of biocrusted microsites. The increments of soil respiration during drying-rewetting cycles were greater in the moss-dominated biocrusts than in the bare soil, which suggested that the response of soil respiration to drying-rewetting cycles was increased by moss-dominated biocrusts. The length of the dry period, number of cycles, intensity of the dry period and frequency of rewetting affected the magnitude of soil respiration at event scales. However, when we analysed all of the drying-rewetting cycles together, that is, at the seasonal scale, the soil temperature was the driving factor affecting the maximum soil respiration after rainfall pulses. Therefore, soil temperature, rather than soil moisture, is the key factor regulating the response of soil respiration to drying-rewetting cycles at the seasonal scale. This study highlights the importance of temperature in regulating soil respiration under drying-rewetting cycles, and the regulatory factors of soil respiration vary at different temporal scales.

Physical disturbance, however, often leads to the degradation of biocrusts, and it remains unclear how the physical disturbance affects biocrust microorganisms and their related metabolism. In this study, the photosynthetic biomass (indicated by chlorophyll a), nutrients, enzyme activities, and bacterial communities of biocrusts were investigated in a gold mine tailing of Central China to evaluate the impact of physical disturbance on biocrusts during the rehabilitation process of gold mine tailings. The results show that physical disturbance significantly reduced the photosynthetic biomass, nutrient contents (organic carbon, ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, and total phosphorus), and enzyme activities (beta-glucosidase, sucrase, nitrogenase, neutral phosphatase, and urease) of biocrusts in the mine tailings. Furthermore, 16S rDNA sequencing showed that physical disturbance strongly changed the composition, structure, and interactions of the bacterial community, leading to a shift from a cyanobacteria dominated community to a heterotrophic bacteria (proteobacteria, actinobacteria, and acidobacteria) dominated community and a more complex bacterial network (higher complexity, nodes, and edges). Altogether, our results show that the biocrusts dominated by cyanobacteria could also develop in the tailings of humid region, and the dominants (e.g., Microcoleus) were the same as those from dryland biocrusts; nevertheless, physical disturbance significantly reduced cyanobacterial relative abundance in biocrusts. Based on our findings, we propose the future work on cyanobacterial inoculation (e.g., Microcoleus), which is expected to promote substrate metabolism and accumulation, ultimately accelerating the development of biocrusts and the subsequent ecological restoration of tailings.

The objectives were to (1) isolate and identify the most predominant EPS-producing cyanobacterium from a dry land of Iran (Segzi plain) and (2) study cyanobacterial inoculation affecting the formation of biocrust and improvement of soil chemico- and biological properties. The most predominant EPS-producing isolated cyanobacterium was identified as Microcoleus vaginatus ATHK43 (MW433686 NCBI accession number) and utilized as soil inoculants. Surface and sub-surface soil chemical (pH, EC, CEC, cations content) and biological properties (chlorophyll a, organic carbon, total N, EPS contents, and invertase and dehydrogenase activities) were investigated during the formation and development of biocrust. The biocrust significantly (P < 0.01) increased EC, total N, K, Ca, Mg, CEC, EPS amount, chlorophyll a, and organic carbon (C) contents of the surface soil. A high and significant correlation was found between chlorophyll content with organic C (R-2 = 0.98), N (R-2 = 0.98), and EPS amount (R-2 = 0.96) of biocrust in the surface soil. The activities of dehydrogenase and invertase enzymes were also significantly increased (P < 0.01) after 90 days of inoculation. In conclusion, such alterations in the soil chemico- and biological properties play an important role in nutrient cycling and improvement of soil structure, fertility, and stability. So, the formation of biocrust by bacterial inoculation can be used as a cost-effective and sustainable biogeotechnological method for re-establishment and enhancement of soil properties in dry and semi-dry lands.																			2190-6815	2190-6823				2022 JAN 31	2022										10.1007/s13399-022-02336-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13399-022-02336-0		JAN 2022											WOS:000750404600002

Mapping management zones in a sandy pasture soil using an objective model and multivariate techniques	PRECISION AGRICULTURE												Soils occupied by dryland pastures usually have low fertility but can exhibit a high spatial variability. Consequently, logical application of fertilisers should be based on an appropriate knowledge of spatial variability of the main soil properties that can affect pasture yield and quality. Delineation of zones with similar soil fertility is necessary to implement site-specific management, reinforcing the interest of methods to identify these homogeneous zones. Thus, the formulation of the objective Rasch model constitutes a new approach in pasture fields. A case study was performed in a pasture field located in a montado (agrosilvopastoral) ecosystem. Measurements of some soil properties (texture, organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, cation exchange capacity and soil apparent electrical conductivity) at 24 sampling locations were integrated in the Rasch model. A classification of all sampling locations according to pasture soil fertility was established. Moreover, the influence of each soil property on the soil fertility was highlighted, with the clay content the most influential property in this sandy soil. Then, a clustering process was undertaken to delimit the homogeneous zones, considering soil pasture fertility, elevation and slope as the input layers. Three zones were delineated and vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI, and normalized difference water index, NDWI) and pasture yield data at sampling locations were employed to check their differences. Results showed that vegetation indices were not suitable to detect the spatial variability between zones. However, differences in pasture yield and quality were evident, besides some key soil properties, such as clay content and organic matter.

Application of polyhalite is expected to be most relevant in soils where the availability of these nutrients is low: in sandy soils, in highly leached soils, or in areas where crops are irrigated by water with low content of these nutrients or are rain-fed. A controlled lysimeter experiment investigated the efficacy of surface applied polyhalite as a fertilizer supplying K, Ca, Mg and S compared to soluble sulfate salts in two soils (sandy and loamy) with or without simulated rain leaching events through two cycles of cropping. In the first cycle, carrot response and nutrient uptake, transport, and loss through leaching were studied, while in the second cycle the residual effect of the fertilizer was considered on maize without additional fertilizer application or leaching. Polyhalite plus rain led to increased carrot yield due to augmented Ca uptake in sandy soil. In both soils, polyhalite behaved as a prolonged availability fertilizer with more nutrients retained in the top soil layer and not leached below the root zone. The treatments did not affect maize growth or nutrient uptake except for lower K and S uptake in soils where rain had been simulated for the previous crop. We conclude that polyhalite shows potential as a commercial fertilizer to supply K, Ca, Mg, and S nutrients under conditions of dryland agriculture where occasionally leaching by rainfall occurs.

Management strategies require an in-depth detection of the modes and mechanisms of local land use change. In this study, to detect the process and spatial pattern of land use change and quantify the spatial relations between oasis expansion and the sources of water and human disturbances, enhanced analysis of land transition matrix and location relationship-based spatial analysis were conducted from 1990 to 2015 in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin (M-HRB), a typical arid inland river basin in China. The results indicated that cultivated land and desert together accounted for more than 90 Wo of the study area. In the M-HRB, cultivated land expansion was an obvious process of land use change. Most of the new cultivated land was reclaimed from desert, but the conversion of grassland to cultivated land was the dominant signal of systematic land transition. Swap changes gradually became the main land transition process from 1990 to 2015. The cultivated land showed a close spatial relationship with land and water resources availability, which also constrained the distribution of cultivated land expansion (i.e., within 200-1400 m of human settlements and within 1000 m of water courses or ditches). The quantification results can be used to facilitate smart land management strategies towards sustainable development in the M-HRB. The methods used here can be adapted to other dryland areas for land change detection that supports sustainable land management.

Extreme drought causes fish recruitment failure in a fragmented Great Plains riverscape	ECOHYDROLOGY												Dryland stream fishes are adapted to highly connected habitats with unpredictable hydrologic conditions, including frequent low flows and sometimes extreme drought. The low flow recruitment hypothesis predicts that some fishes spawn in main channel habitats during low flows when water temperatures and prey densities are high. However, extreme low flows during drought periods might be disruptive even among fishes whose life histories otherwise benefit from lower flows. We studied recruitment dynamics of six fishes (family Cyprinidae) at 15 sites in a fragmented Great Plains riverscape in Kansas, USA, during 2 years of extreme drought. We tracked the chronology of gonadal development and age 0 recruitment to test the hypothesis that recruitment by fishes that broadcast spawn planktonic ova would be less successful compared with fishes that spawn demersal or adhesive ova. We found all six taxa were reproductively active but recruitment was evident for only four. The two species for which recruitment was not evident, peppered chub (Macrhybopsis tetranema) and silver chub (Macrhybopsis storeriana), are confirmed or suspected pelagic-broadcast spawning fishes that have declined in other fragmented and dewatered Great Plains riverscapes. Our data highlight the potential for extreme low flows within isolated stream fragments to cause complete or near-complete recruitment failure for pelagic-broadcast spawning fishes, especially those with small population sizes. Failed recruitment during extreme drought may be related to spawning mode, ova characteristics, or both. Our work informs management of fish diversity in drought-prone riverscapes by establishing mechanistic linkages among extreme drought, fish recruitment, and assemblage structure.																			1936-0584	1936-0592				SEP	2019	12	6							e2120	10.1002/eco.2120	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.2120		JUN 2019											WOS:000473600500001

Biocrusts Modulate Climate Change Effects on Soil Organic Carbon Pools: Insights From a 9-Year Experiment	ECOSYSTEMS												Accumulating evidence suggests that warming associated with climate change is decreasing the total amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) in drylands, although scientific research has not given enough emphasis to particulate (POC) and mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) pools. Biocrusts are a major biotic feature of drylands and have large impacts on the C cycle, yet it is largely unknown whether they modulate the responses of POC and MAOC to climate change. Here, we assessed the effects of simulated climate change (control, reduced rainfall (RE), warming (WA), and RE + WA) and initial biocrust cover (low (< 20%) versus high (> 50%)) on the mineral protection of soil C and soil organic matter quality in a dryland ecosystem in central Spain for 9 years. At low initial biocrust cover levels, both WA and RE + WA increased SOC, especially POC but also MAOC, and promoted a higher contribution of carbohydrates, relative to aromatic compounds, to the POC fraction. These results suggest that the accumulation of soil C under warming treatments may be transitory in soils with low initial biocrust cover. In soils with high initial biocrust cover, climate change treatments did not affect SOC, neither POC nor MAOC fraction. Overall, our results indicate that biocrust communities modulate the negative effect of climate change on SOC, because no losses of soil C were observed with the climate manipulations under biocrusts. Future work should focus on determining the long-term persistence of the observed buffering effect by biocrust-forming lichens, as they are known to be negatively affected by warming.

Although cumin is an economic cash crop, limited efforts have been made for varietal developments. In India, Rajasthan, Gujarat is central cumin cultivar states, the zone under cumin development is around 841940 hectares with yearly productivity of 546750 tones, which contributes around 8200 crore rupees yearly. Gujarat, it is covering a territory of around 3, 37007 hectares. Several biotic stresses can confine productivity. Cumin is seriously affected by the Fusarium wilt disease caused by the soil-borne pathogen Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium equiseti, resulting in yield losses of up to 80% depending on severity of infestation. Biological control has emerged as one of the most promising alternatives to chemical fungicides. The experiment was carried out to assess their possible use as bio-agents for several antagonistic fungi and bacteria under in vitro conditions using the food poison technique with selected biological control agents. Trichoderma harzianum, T. konngii, T. viride, Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. putida, A. niger, A. flavus, Penicillium citrinum, Serratia marcescens, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae were used for this study. In-vitro test showed that selected microbes were showing antagonistic activity towards F. oxysporum. Trichoderma spp. was the best bio-agent, who had 66 to 81% inhibition zone. Aspergillus spp and Pseudomonas spp. emerged as effective bio-agents with 63-67% and 68 to 76% zone inhibition. The aim of this study is to become a suitable milestone for future studies and provide with updated information on ways to eliminate wilting in cumin.

Modeling emergence of sterile oat (<i>Avena sterilis</i> ssp. <i>ludoviciana</i>) under semiarid conditions	WEED SCIENCE												Winter wild oat [Avena sterilis ssp. ludoviciana (Durieu) Gillet & Magne; referred to as A. sterilis here] is one of the major weed species of the Avena genus, given its high competitive ability to infest cereal crops worldwide, with special concern in Spain. A nine-location field experiment was established across Spain where a total of 400 A. sterilis seeds per location were sowed in four replicates in autumn 2016 to monitor the emergence during two growing seasons in dryland conditions. The data were used to test the prediction ability of previously published thermal (TT) and hydrothermal time (HTT) models and to develop new models, if required. Overall, the average percentage of emergence was 30% during the first season and 21% during the second season. In both seasons, the main emergence flush occurred between November and February. According to the phenological stage, A. sterilis achieved the tillering earlier in southern sites, between November 25 and the end of December, compared with northern sites, where this stage was reached at the end of January. The newly developed model described the emergence with precision, using three cardinal temperatures to estimate the TT. The three cardinal points were established at -1.0, 5.8, and 18.0 C for base (T (b)), optimum (T (o)), and ceiling temperature (T (c)), while the base water potential (psi(b)) was established at -0.2 MPa for the HTT estimation. This study contributes to improving prediction of the emergence of A. sterilis and provides knowledge for decision support systems (DSS) for the control of this weed.

The challenges of extreme droughts require the adaptation of agriculture especially during the intense growth phase of crops. For dryland farming, the selections of the optimal land use type and sustainable agricultural land management are potential adaptation tools for facing the challenges posed by increased aridity. To this end, it is indispensable to understand soil moisture (SM) dynamics under different land use types over drought-affected periods. Within the framework of a Slovenian-Hungarian project, soil moisture, matric potential and rainfall time series have been collected at three pilot sites of different land use types (pasture, orchards and a ploughland) in SW Hungary since September 2018. Experiments were carried out in soils of silt, silt loam and clay loam texture. In the summers (June 1 to August 31) of 2019 and 2022, we identified normal and dry conditions, respectively, with regard to differences in water balance. Our results demonstrated that soil moisture is closely controlled by land use. Marked differences of the moisture regime were revealed among the three land use types based on statistical analyses. Soils under pasture had the most balanced regime, whereas ploughland soils indicated the highest amplitude of moisture dynamics. The orchard, however, showed responses to weather conditions in sharp contrast with the other two sites. Our results are applicable for loamy soils under humid and subhumid temperate climates and for periods of extreme droughts, a condition which is expected to be the norm for the future.

The responses of such ecosystems to weather and environmental conditions remain important factors that limit the accurate projections of carbon balance under future climate change. Here, we investigated how shifts in vegetation phenology resulting from changes in weather and environmental conditions influenced ecosystem carbon cycling in one semiarid ecosystem in the Hanford area of central Washington, United States. We examined two years of measurements of the phenology camera, eddy covariance, and soil chamber from an upland semiarid sagebrush ecosystem. Both years had contrasting diel and seasonal patterns of CO2 fluxes, primarily driven by differences in vegetation phenology. The net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) and evapotranspiration (ET) in 2019 were enlarged by shifted vegetation phenology, as a cold and snow-covered winter and warm and dry winter in 2020 resulted in constrained magnitudes of NEE and ET during the summer months. The annual gross primary productivity (GPP) was much higher in 2019 than in 2020 (-211 vs. -112 gC m(-2)), whereas ecosystem respiration was comparable in these two years (164 vs. 144 gC m(-2)). Thus, the annual NEE in 2019 was negative (-47 gC m(-2)) with the sagebrush ecosystem functioning as a carbon sink, while the positive annual NEE in 2020 indicated that the sagebrush ecosystem functioned as a carbon source. Our results demonstrate that winter snowpack can be a critical driver of annual carbon uptake in semiarid sagebrush ecosystems.

Ever since its initiation (1981), large tracts of degraded lands are treated through this approach. Remote sensing (RS) is a tool that has been successfully applied to capture groundwater potentials in different regions and geological units. In this study RS & GIS tools are applied to correlate groundwater potentials with various geological controls and watershed development activities at Anjeni watershed, Udaipur district, Rajasthan, India. In the study reference periods taken are year 2013 (pre-project) and 2016 (post-project). A hydro-geomorphological approach integrating remote sensing applications, field investigations, geological and hydrological studies were undertaken to delineate and study the groundwater potential along with recharge dynamics before and after intervention situation. Thematic maps were prepared through linking the RS data with morphometric characteristics, topographic analysis, land use/cover assessment and groundwater conditions. Geographical Information System (GIS) was used to integrate all the contributing factors like lithology, geomorphology, LU/LC, lineaments, drainage, and slope with the help of weighted overlay analysis. Merging the characteristics of groundwater potential, hydro-geomorphology, geology, water harvesting structures, morphometric analysis, lineament density studies, and water balance elements provide an effective approach for the delineation of potential sites for groundwater. This integrated approach has successfully captured the changes that occurred in groundwater situation of the Anjeni watershed in form of poor to very high groundwater potential zones. It establishes the importance of application of RS-GIS in flagship development program of the watershed management.																			0016-7622	0974-6889				JUL	2022	98	7					961	970		10.1007/s12594-022-2101-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12594-022-2101-3													WOS:000825994000012

Soil water repellence increased early wheat growth and nutrient uptake	PLANT AND SOIL												Purpose Soil water repellence causes uneven soil wetting which can constrain dryland crop and pasture establishment and yield. The same processes are likely to affect nutrient availability from soil and fertiliser, but the effects of repellence on crop growth and nutrition per se have seldom been reported. Here, we investigated early wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Mace) growth and nutrient uptake responses to repellence. Methods Wheat was furrow-sown in severely repellent sandy loam soil (with a wettable furrow base to allow for germination) or completely wettable soil, under uniform plant density and variable topsoil thickness (20 or 100 mm) and fertiliser band placement (below or away from the seed). Tiller number, shoot dry matter, shoot N concentration, total nutrient uptake, and root length density (RLD) were determined. Results Contrary to expectations, repellence significantly increased tiller number (by up to 2 tillers per plant), shoot dry matter (by 82%), shoot N concentration (by 0.3% N), and total nutrient uptake (by 87%) at 51 days after sowing, regardless of topsoil thickness and fertiliser placement. In the furrow, RLD of repellent treatments was also nearly double that in wettable treatments when fertiliser was banded below the seed. Results suggest that preferential soil wetting of the furrow in repellent treatments favoured plant nutrient uptake under regular but low water supply. Conclusion We conclude that for water-repellent soils with limited water supply, water harvesting techniques such as furrow sowing and banding wetting agents could boost water and nutrient uptake and early crop growth.

J	Zhang, ZY; Ju, WM; Zhou, YL				Zhang, Zhenyu; Ju, Weimin; Zhou, Yanlian			The effect of water stress on net primary productivity in northwest China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Net primary productivity (NPP) has been widely used as the indicator of vegetation function and exhibits large spatial and temporal variations caused by numerous factors. Northwest China (NWC) is one of the driest regions in China, and water supply is the key determinant of NPP here. However, studies on the effects of water stress on NPP in NWC at the regional scale are still relatively lacking. Thus, in this study, based on a set of Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NPP and evapotranspiration (ET) datasets, we quantified the response of NPP to water stress, which is indicated by crop water stress index (CWSI). Regional average of annual NPP in NWC showed an increasing trend during the study period, at a rate of 0.84 g C m(-2) yr(-1). At the province level, the NPP increase rates increased in the order of Ningxia (7.7%), Shaanxi (6.5%), Gansu (4.5%), Qinghai (3.8%), and Xinjiang (1.7%). NPP was negatively correlated with CWSI (p<0.05) in 73% of areas, indicating the key role of water stress in constraining NPP over this arid region. The effect of water stress on NPP changes with elevation. Water stress has the strongest negative impact on NPP in areas with elevations around 2000 m. In elevations above 5000 m, NPP is not limited by water stress, mostly positively correlated with CWSI. Our findings further clarify the importance of water stress in dryland ecosystems, while highlighting that elevation gradients can significantly affect the correlation between NPP and water stress.						zhang, zhenyu/0000-0003-2605-7008													0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2021	28	46					65885	65898		10.1007/s11356-021-15314-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15314-2		JUL 2021						34327647					WOS:000679275700007

Consequently, this study is motivated by investigating the projection and uncertainties of drought change over northern China based on 20 CMIP5 multi-model ensemble (AMME) and best multi-model ensemble (BMME) under middle and high emission scenarios. BMME selected in term of the spatial patterns and interannual variability of aridity index (AI) against the observations shows better performance on the simulation of dryland especially for hyper-arid areas in Northwest China (NWC) and sub-humid regions in North China (NC). In the middle of 21st century, the projections from two model ensembles illustrate the aggravation of drought in loess plateau and west of Xinjiang but reduction of acridity over NWC. Northeast China (NEC) becomes more arid under RCP8.5 that is sensitive with the high emission. The uncertainties increase between two model ensembles at the end of 21st century when the opposite trend can be found over NC under RCP4.5 and NEC under RCP8.5, respectively. The increasing rate of precipitation and PET is the key factor for AI change. The larger contribution of precipitation than PET results in the humid tendency over NWC. Moreover, the equivalent contributions of precipitation and PET induce the increased uncertainties in AI change over NC and NEC. Similarly, the temporal evaluation of AI indicates decreasing trend of drought over NWC but the large uncertainties can be found after middle of this century over NEC and in the early of the century over NC.																			0899-8418	1097-0088				JAN	2021	41			1			E3085	E3100		10.1002/joc.6907	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.6907		NOV 2020											WOS:000584927800001

Texas has 16 regional water planning zones characterized by distinct populations, water demands, and existingwater supplies. Each is expected to face variations of pressures, such as increased agricultural and energy development (particularly hydraulic fracturing) and urban growth that do not necessarily follow the region's water plan. Great variability in resource distribution and competing resource demands across Texas will result in the emergence of distinct hotspots, each with unique characteristics that require multiple, localized, interventions to bridge the statewide water gap. This study explores three such hotspots: 1) water-food competition in Lubbock and the potential of producing 3 billion gallons of treated municipal wastewater and encouraging dryland agriculture; 2) implementing LowImpact Developments (LIDs) for agriculture in the City of San Antonio, potentially adding 47 billion gallons of water supply, but carrying a potentially high financial cost; and 3) water-energy interrelations in the Eagle Ford Shale in light of well counts, climate dynamics, and population growth. The growing water gap is a state wide problem that requires holistic assessments that capture the impact on the tightly interconnected water, energy, and food systems. Better understanding the trade-offs associated with each 'solution' and enabling informed dialogue between stakeholders, offers a basis for formulating localized policy recommendations specific to each hotspot.

However, the complexity of landscapes can moderate how much such events impact their vegetation productivity. Accordingly, more complex landscapes are expected to be less likely to experience drought-induced vegetation productivity loss than less complex landscapes. Understanding the relationship between loss of vegetation productivity and the landscape complexity during drought events is fundamental to designing sound adaptation policies and practices for dryland societies. We evaluated the effects of variation in annual precipitation and complexity on the vegetation productivity of 33 landscapes in the Caatinga, the largest region of tropical dry forests in South America, before, during, and after one of the region's worst drought events the past 30 years. We combined field measurements, satellite images, and modeling to quantify the vegetation productivity and landscape complexity. In general, our results show that the vegetation productivity of more complex landscapes was always higher than in less complex landscapes throughout the study period. However, the difference in vegetation productivity between landscapes with different complexities was more pronounced during the drought years. In addition, we found that the landscape complexity positively influenced vegetation productivity in all years, but that precipitation had no effect on vegetation productivity during the driest and wettest years. Our results indicate that maintaining more complex landscapes is the best adaptive strategy to guarantee drylands vegetation productivity during extreme climatic events.

However, it is difficult to precisely assess the performances of drought mitigation measures, especially when multiple measures are implemented simultaneously. Here, a remote sensing-based agricultural drought-affected area change index (ADAC) was applied to assess the per-formance of drought mitigation schemes, which separates and avoids confusion between performances of drought mitigation and wheat yield improvement. The results revealed the historical performance changes and regional differences under drought mitigation measures in 12 major wheat-growing regions (WGRs) of the world. The drought mitigation efforts have steadily succeeded, with a reduction in the drought-affected area of approximately 14.5 % in the 1980s and 28.5 % in the last decade, relatively 55 % of drought-affected areas are alleviated in the 12 WGRs. However, there are significant regional differences ranging from 28 % to 79 % in the 12 WGRs. The drought mitigation measures implemented in the WGRs of China and India, followed by France and Ukraine, are more effective than other regions, while a few are still declining. By further evaluating the effects of short-term and long-term drought mitigation strategies taken in the WGRs, we found that irrigation is the main drought mitigation measure in dryland, while measures such as conservation tillage are of great value for yield stability for both dry and wet areas. The results of this study improve the understanding of the regional performance of drought mitigation schemes and will help stakeholders to select appropriate measures.

Seedlings of Acacia nilotica, Azadirachta indica, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Prosopis cineraria, P. juliflora, Tamarix aphylla, Salvadora persica, S. oleoides and Tecomella undulata were planted and irrigated with bore-well (BW) and treated wastewater (WW) at 1/2ET (evapotranspiration) and 3/4ET. Changes in soil properties and plant biomass allocation in different parts were assessed for species efficacy in phytoremediation of wastewater-contaminated soils and enhanced biomass yield. Irrigation enhanced soil pH, EC, SOC, available nutrients (greater in 0-30-cm soil layer than in 30-60-cm soil layer) and plant biomass. Wastewater irrigation had stronger effect in enhancing soil EC, SOC, NH4-N and NO3-N (3.50-76.92%), whereas increased quantity of irrigation showed stronger effects on PO4-P, K, and root and shoot biomass (7.63-51.20%). High biomass in A. nilotica, A. indica, E. camaldulensis and P. juliflora plants was supported by increased root biomass to exploit increased level of water and nutrients. Indigenous S. oleoides, T. undulata, P. cineraria and S. persica showed greater potential of salts and nutrient absorption from the wastewater-contaminated soils. Moderate increase in pH and EC with simultaneous increase in SOC, nutrients and biomass exhibited beneficial use of wastewater in dryland afforestation. A. nilotica, A. indica, E. camaldulensis and P. juliflora were most efficient in utilising treated wastewater and beneficially can be utilised in urban afforestation and sustainable development of dry areas.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				JUN	2022	233	6							219	10.1007/s11270-022-05692-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-022-05692-9													WOS:000806772700001

The ecological importance of moss ground cover in dry shrubland restoration within an irrigated agricultural landscape matrix	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Kanuka (Kunzea serotina, Myrtaceae) dryland shrubland communities of the lowland plains of South Island (Te Wai Pounamu), New Zealand (Aoteoroa), contain a ground cover largely consisting of mosses, predominantly Hypnum cupressiforme. There has been no previous study of the role of mosses in this threatened habitat which is currently being restored within a contemporary irrigated and intensively farmed landscape that may be incompatible with this component of the ecosystem. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of moss ground cover on hydrology, nitrogen (N) availability and vascular plant interactions, and in relation to nutrient spillover from adjacent farmland. Experimental work was a combination of glasshouse experiments and field-based studies. Extremes of soil temperature and moisture were found to be mediated by the moss carpet, which also influenced N speciation; available N declined with moss depth. The moss layer decreased the amount of germination and establishment of vascular plants but, in some cases, enhanced their growth. Spillover of mineral nitrogen and phosphate from farmland enhanced invasion of exotic grasses which may have benefited from conditions provided by the moss carpet. Synthesis: We found the moss layer to be crucial to ecosystem functioning in these dry habitats with low nutrient substrate. However, when the moss layer is accompanied by nutrient spillover, it has the potential to increase exotic weed encroachment. Our results not only emphasize the importance of non-vascular plant inclusion in restoration schemes but also highlights the importance of mitigating for nutrient spillover.

Its growth is affected by various environmental conditions such as soil, climate, and water supply. Irrigation is one of the most important factors for crop management. This research was designed with the aim of studying the biochemical and anatomical features of two genotypes of cottonseed (Latif and Golestan) in order to determine optimum irrigation. Protein, starch, gossypol gland, total soluble protein, starch content, and the anatomical structure of the cotton seeds were investigated. The data were analyzed using the SAS Software. The results showed that when rainfed, Golestan genotype seeds had a larger number of secretory cavities, soluble protein, and starch compared to Latif seeds. There was also a noticeable difference in the size of the seeds. Cellulosic cell walls and protein particles were also observed in the seed structure under induced water stress conditions. It can therefore be concluded that in response to water shortage, there was a noticeable change in the morphometric, anatomic, and biochemical features of the cottonseeds. It can be concluded that when rainfed, the Golestan genotype of cottonseed has more compatibility than the Latif genotype. In general, the application of different levels of irrigation showed that at moderate levels of irrigation, anatomical features appeared more normal. The observations indicate that at high levels of irrigation, some cells begin to dehisce due to osmotic stress, which results in a lack of accurate formation of tissue structures. The Golestan genotype is therefore the best suited for dryland farming.

Towards a predictive framework for biocrust mediation of plant performance: A meta-analysis	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Understanding the importance of biotic interactions in driving the distribution and abundance of species is a central goal of plant ecology. Early vascular plants likely colonized land occupied by biocrusts - photoautotrophic, surface-dwelling soil communities comprised of cyanobacteria, bryophytes, lichens and fungi - suggesting biotic interactions between biocrusts and plants have been at play for some 2,000 million years. Today, biocrusts coexist with plants in dryland ecosystems worldwide, and have been shown to both facilitate or inhibit plant species performance depending on ecological context. Yet, the factors that drive the direction and magnitude of these effects remain largely unknown. We conducted a meta-analysis of plant responses to biocrusts using a global dataset encompassing 1,004 studies from six continents. Meta-analysis revealed there is no simple positive or negative effect of biocrusts on plants. Rather, plant responses differ by biocrust composition and plant species traits and vary across plant ontogeny. Moss-dominated biocrusts facilitated, while lichen-dominated biocrusts inhibited overall plant performance. Plant responses also varied among plant functional groups: C-4 grasses received greater benefits from biocrusts compared to C-3 grasses, and plants without N-fixing symbionts responded more positively to biocrusts than plants with N-fixing symbionts. Biocrusts decreased germination but facilitated growth of non-native plant species. Synthesis. Results suggest that interspecific variation in plant responses to biocrusts, contingent on biocrust type, plant traits, and ontogeny can have strong impacts on plant species performance. These findings have important implications for understanding biocrust contributions to plant productivity and community assembly processes in ecosystems worldwide.

The present study is focused on assessing the sensitivity of coherent, incoherent, model and Eigen vector-based decomposition techniques from multitemporal Radarsat-2 polarimetric dataset to scattering mechanisms occurring in the critical growth stages of pearl millet crop. Yamaguchi volume component along with its temporal response was observed to be sensitive and reliable due to its dynamic biomass characterization. Overestimation of volume component and earlier saturation of biomass from 4 kgm-2 were observed limitations in Freeman 2 & 3 component decomposition when dealing with higher vegetation crops. The decrease in volume scattering over increasing biomass proved Van Zyl response contrary to the established understanding. Panicle stage was identified as the critical stage for discriminating pearl millet from similar structured maize and sorghum crops. In this stage, alpha angle generated from Cloude-Pottier decomposition almost reached 550 indicating the increase in contribution of dihedral scattering due to vertical prominent panicles in the pearl millet fields. The various Touzi parameters (a1, gi1, u1 and s1) were observed to have sensitivity towards changes in crop canopy structures, which will require further research to verify. The proposed D(F3-Y4) was the most suitable Volume Difference Index (VDI) for characterizing biomass of erectophile crops as the dynamic biomass response was found even beyond 8 kgm2.

Recent studies have shown that SIC is not stable as previously supposed, and can be employed by certain microbes and transformed into organics in soils; however, this transformation remains largely unexplored. We performed in situ C-13 tracing in desert bulk soil and employed metagenomics to predict the microbial metabolic processes associated with carbon transformation. The tracing data showed that the C-13 signature profile in soil organic carbon (SOC) originated from SIC with a carbon transformation content of 6.881 mg m(-2) during the feeding periods, corresponding to a rate of 3.276 mu g kg(-1) d(-1). Metagenomic analysis identified genes encoding enzymes related to microbial CO2 and HCO3- fixation, accounting for 0.448% (based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database) and 0.668% (based on Evolutionary genealogy of genes: Non-supervised Orthologous Groups database) of all ascertained genes. Soil microbes, from a broad taxonomic range, harboring these genes mainly contributed toward chemoautotrophic and heterotrophic carbon fixation. Our results demonstrated that the microbes employed the chemoautotrophic and heterotrophic pathways, namely, dark microbial pathways, for SIC transformation into SOC. Although the amount of SOC derived from the dark microbial fixation process was not assessed, the present study highlights a neglected carbon transformation process mediated by soil microbes in drylands and provides insights into carbon transformation of SIC to SOC in dryland soil.

Nutritional properties of some browse species used as goat feed in Pastoral dry lands, Uganda	AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS												The nutritional properties of leaves of ten browse species commonly used as goat feed in pastoral drylands of Uganda were evaluated by determining their chemical composition and in vitro gas production. Dry matter (DM) content ranged between 896 and 914 g kg(-1)DM and was not significantly different (P > 0.05) among the browse species. There was a wide variation in the crude protein (CP) content of the browse species. The highest CP values were observed inAcacia compylacantha,Acacia fruiticosaandAcacia senegal, with 365, 247 and 245 g kg(-1)DM respectively, while the lowest was observed inGanisa similis(150 g kg(-1)DM). The NDF values were highest inA. senegal(343 g kg(-1)DM) and lowest inA. compylacantha(151 g kg(-1)DM). There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in the gas kinetics and total volume of gas produced by the browse species. The calculated organic matter digestibility (OMD) was highest (P < 0.05) inCadaba farinosa(92.5%) and lowest inDichrostachys cinerea(72.5%). Similarly, the metabolizable energy (ME) was highest (P < 0.05) inC. farinosa(13.7 MJ kg(-1)) and lowest inD. cinerea(10.7 MJ kg(-1)). Total gas had a positive correlation with OMD (r = 0.51,P < 0.05) and ME (r = 0.52,P < 0.01). Strong positive correlation was observed between OMD and ME (r = 0.998,P < 0.001). In conclusion, these browse species have sufficient CP and ME required by growing goats under dryland conditions.

Quantification of such variations helps to better understand the changes in soil texture and subsoil constraints to inform spatially explicit management practice. An inverse modelling approach to estimate PAWC from crop yields was developed as a more cost-effective alternative to traditional soil sampling methods. In this study, we further extend this approach to predict and map in-field variations of PAWC from yield maps of single and multiple crops. Soil PAWC maps were produced based on inversely predicted PAWC using crop yield maps together with in-field management information, and compared with: 1) available water capacity derived using laboratory-measured soil properties, and 2) soil types derived from proximally sensed soil spectra and ground geophysics for four representative farms in Australia. The results show that the predicted PAWC maps matched well with within-field spatial variation of soil types, and well reflected the impact of soil constraints (e.g. salinity), and soil classifications from soil survey and local experience. This demonstrates that the predicted PAWC from crop yield using inverse modelling can reflect the soil physicochemical variations within-field. The generated PAWC maps can be combined with process-based modelling to predict crop yield and yield zones and to inform spatial field management and soil sampling.

Their soils may develop not only histic but also andic characteristics. Yet, mineral eolian deposition as an environmental determinant of peatlands in Iceland is still poorly understood, not least with regard to the peatlands carbon (C) stores. This study advances our understanding of the impact of tephra deposition on Histosols by elucidating interactions between C characteristics and andic soil properties. We compare Histosols from three Icelandic peatlands of different degrees of exposure to eolian deposition by evaluating data sets of their C structure derived by C-13 NMR spectroscopy, andic soil properties based on selective extractions of Al, Fe, and Si, and decomposition proxies C/N, delta C-13, and delta N-15. By applying multivariate statistical methods, we are able to present several important patterns. Soil organic matter of Histosols with andic properties is less decomposed than that of Histosols without notable andic properties. Andic soil properties seem to impact their C structure by facilitating the formation of organo-mineral complexes, which particularly hamper the decomposition of chemically more labile C groups. Tephra layers appear to hamper microbial activity in deeper soil layers by preventing input of fresh organic matter. The interaction of andic and histic soil properties and the protective role of major tephra deposits may enable an unusual potential for long-term C stabilization in a natural peatland environment.

J	Taylor, SD; Browning, DM; Baca, RA; Gao, F				Taylor, Shawn D.; Browning, Dawn M.; Baca, Ruben A.; Gao, Feng			Constraints and Opportunities for Detecting Land Surface Phenology in Drylands	JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Land surface phenology (LSP) enables global-scale tracking of ecosystem processes, but its utility is limited in drylands due to low vegetation cover and resulting low annual amplitudes of vegetation indices (VIs). Due to the importance of drylands for biodiversity, food security, and the carbon cycle, it is necessary to understand the limitations in measuring dryland dynamics. Here, using simulated data and multitemporal unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery of a desert shrubland, we explore the feasibility of detecting LSP with respect to fractional vegetation cover, plant functional types, VI uncertainty, and two different detection algorithms. Using simulated data, we found that plants with distinct VI signals, such as deciduous shrubs, can require up to 60% fractional cover to consistently detect LSP. Evergreen plants, with lower seasonal VI amplitude, require considerably higher cover and can have undetectable phenology even with 100% vegetation cover. Our evaluation of two algorithms showed that neither performed the best in all cases. Even with adequate cover, biases in phenological metrics can still exceed 20 days and can never be 100% accurate due to VI uncertainty from shadows, sensor view angle, and atmospheric interference. We showed how high-resolution UAV imagery enables LSP studies in drylands and highlighted important scale effects driven by within-canopy VI variation. With high-resolution imagery, the open canopies of drylands are beneficial as they allow for straightforward identification of individual plants, enabling the tracking of phenology at the individual level. Drylands thus have the potential to become an exemplary environment for future LSP research.

However, timely information about their spatial extent and location remains scarce. To overcome this lack of information, we propose to classify fractional cover data from Sentinel-2 with biased support vector machines. Fractional cover images describe the land surface in intuitive, biophysical terms, which reduces the spectral variability within the fallow class. Biased support vector machines are a type of one-class classifiers that require labelled data for the class of interest and unlabelled data for the other classes. They allow us to extrapolate in-situ observations collected during flowering to the rest of the growing season to generate large training data sets, thereby reducing the data collection requirements. We tested this approach to monitor fallows in the northern grains region of Australia and showed that the seasonal fallow extent can be mapped with >92% accuracy both during the summer and winter seasons. The summer fallow extent can be accurately mapped as early as mid-December (1-4 months before harvest). The winter fallow extent can be accurately mapped from mid-August (2-4 months before harvest). Our method also detected emergence dates successfully, indicating the near real-time accuracy of our method. We estimated that the extent of fallow fields across the northern grains region of Australia ranged between 50% in winter 2017 and 85% in winter 2019. Our method is scalable, sensor independent and economical to run. As such, it lays the foundations for reconstructing and monitoring the cropping dynamics in Australia.

Moench] is an important dryland crop in the semiarid tropics, and temperature and photoperiod are the main environmental factors affecting its phenology and thus adaptation. The objectives of this study were to quantify the response of development rate to temperature and photoperiod for 19 diverse Ethiopian sorghum genotypes, and to determine if differences in these responses could be linked to racial grouping or agroecological adaptation. The genotypes, representing four major sorghum races and adaptation to four agroecological zones, were sown on 12 dates at two locations in Ethiopia with contrasting altitude. This created a range in photoperiod and temperatures relevant to Ethiopian conditions. Days from emergence to flag leaf appearance, anthesis, and maturity were recorded. A predictive phenology modeling framework was used to fit the effects of photoperiod and temperature on the rate of development for both the pre- and post-anthesis periods. Results indicated that the pre-anthesis development rate was independent of photoperiod for the range tested. This result differed from West African germplasm and likely reflects differences in agroecological adaptation and racial background. Significant genotypic differences were observed for the base temperature (0-9.8 degrees C) and for the optimum rate of development (0.011-0.022 d(-1), with low value indicating late anthesis), with differences related to agroecology and racial type. Post-anthesis differences in the temperature response were minor. The observed differences in pre-anthesis base temperature can positively affect sorghum breeding programs globally, especially in temperate regions where suitability for early spring plantings is often restricted by low temperatures.

'TAM 204' Wheat, Adapted to Grazing, Grain, and Graze-out Production Systems in the Southern High Plains	JOURNAL OF PLANT REGISTRATIONS												'TAM 204' (Reg. no. CV-1155, PI 686859), a hard red winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar with the experimental designation of TX06V7266, was developed and released by Texas A&M AgriLife Research in 2014. TAM 204 is an F-4-derived line from the cross 'TAM 112'/TX01M5009 made at Vernon, TX, in 2001. TAM 204 is an apically awnletted, medium-maturing, semidwarf wheat with red glumes. It was released primarily as a grain, dual-purpose, and graze-out wheat with high grain and forage yield potential. It has good acid soil tolerance, is resistant to Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus, Wheat streak mosaic virus and its vector wheat curl mite, greenbug, stem rust and stripe rust, and it is moderately susceptible to leaf rust. TAM 204 has a high level of resistance to Hessian fly biotypes GP and vH9 and a moderate level of resistance to biotype vH13. Compared with 'TAM 111', which is currently the most widely grown cultivars in Texas, TAM 204 has significantly higher grain yield in the Texas High Plains under both irrigated and dryland environments. Compared with 'TAM 401' and 'Weathermaster 135', which are currently the two most popular apically awnletted cultivars in Texas, TAM 204 has similar forage yield but higher grain yield across a wide range of environments. TAM 204 could be a better option for wheat growers and cattle owners under grain-only, dual-purpose (grazing-plus-grain), and graze-out production system in the southern US Great Plains.

To quantify changes in AMF infection rate and subsequent effects on nutrient uptake and growth, we grew rice (wetland crop) and pearl millet (dryland crop) genotypes with or without the commercial inoculant Dr. Kinkon (Glomus sp. R10) in Andosol upland fields in 2020 and 2021. Root infection rates were measured in shallow (0-10 cm) and deep (20-30 cm) layers under three water regimes: well-irrigated, half-irrigated, and non-irrigated. Inoculation enhanced shoot dry weight (SDW), plant height, tiller number, phosphorus (P) uptake, leaf water potential, photosynthetic rate (measured only in 2021) and root transversal area. The increase in SDW with inoculation was higher under well-irrigated than under water-limited conditions. The increment in pearl millet SDW was related to higher P uptake associated with higher infection rates, whereas that in rice SDW was related to maintenance of leaf water potential, greater root transversal area and root length density, and higher P uptake but not to infection rate parameters. Inoculation increased mycorrhizal and vesicular infection rates with the similar tendency for arbuscular infection rate and qPCR. Infection rates were similar across water regimes in both years despite significant differences in plant growth parameters with higher rates in deep than shallow layers. AMF inoculation enhanced infection rates, mostly independent of water regime, but plant growth enhancement was greater under the well-irrigated treatment and was more directly linked with infection rates in pearl millet.

J	Nevins, C; Strauss, SL; Inglett, P				Nevins, Clayton; Strauss, Sarah L.; Inglett, Patrick			Contrasting effects of agroecosystem biocrusts on seedling growth and nitrogen accumulation in a greenhouse environment	AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES & ENVIRONMENT												Biological soil crust (biocrust) communities of bacteria, fungi, lichen, algae, and bryophytes were recently shown to release nitrogen (N) to the crop root zone in agroecosystems. While biocrusts in semi-arid and dryland ecosystems have neutral, negative, and facilitative effects on plants, it is not known how agroecosystem biocrusts affect crop N accumulation and growth. Like biocrusts, legume cover crop associations with N-fixing bacteria can increase soil N after termination, potentially supporting primary crops. This research compared the effects of biocrust application to a legume cover crop (cowpea; Vigna unguiculata) on citrus (Citrus sinensis) rootstock seedling growth, root system, and N accumulation. Seedling biomass, N accumulation, and stable N isotopic ratios (delta N-15) were quantified after 29 and 120 d. Sampling date and amendment type had significant effects on seedling biomass, N content, root biomass distributions, and delta N-15 (p < .05). Seedlings with cowpea had less biomass than seedlings with biocrust or no amendment after 29 d. After 120 d, seedlings with biocrusts had significantly less biomass than seedlings with cowpea or no amendment (p < .05). Furthermore, seedlings without an amendment had significantly greater total root length than seedlings with an amendment (p < .05). Seedlings with biocrust had significantly less total N than seedlings with cowpea or no amendment despite having significantly lower plant delta N-15 (p < .05). These delta N-15 values indicated biocrust and cowpea were potentially N sources for seedlings. Overall, cowpea initially inhibited seedling growth, and biocrust had neutral and negative effects on seedling growth after 120 d.

Here, 172 samples of Pinus sylvestris stemwood found either as standing (snags) or fallen tree trunks (coarse woody debris) from forested and treeline (ecotone) sites in northwest Finnish Lapland was compared with living tree data representing 1071 P. sylvestris trees growing in the region. The number of subfossil samples was found to increase in both the ecotone and forested sites since AD 1000. Divergent courses of de positional histories were evident with the reversal of the trend in subfossil number circa AD 1600 in the ecotone sites and circa AD 1800 in the forested sites. Comparisons with subfossil P. sylvestris trees from lacustrine archives in the same region showed synchronous accumulation pulses around AD 1100, AD 1300, AD 1500 and AD 1700. Moreover, the percentage of ecotone samples showed a long-term decline since AD 1000, in agreement with previously published records of pine pollen influx and subfossil P. sylvestris trees from lacustrine archives. Two major phases of increased pine recruitment across the dryland sites in Finnish Lapland, Scandes Mountains and Kola Peninsula were evident for AD 1000-1200 and AD 1400-1600 periods. This suggests that the pine recruitment was generally increased during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries AD, and impaired during the cold phases of the two-stage Little Ice Age. Living tree data demonstrated latitudinal and altitudinal advances and intensified regeneration of treeline P. sylvestris since AD 1930s. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Fletcher, A; Ogden, G; Sharma, D				Fletcher, Andrew; Ogden, Gary; Sharma, Darshan			Mixing it up - wheat cultivar mixtures can increase yield and buffer the risk of flowering too early or too late	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												Mixtures of wheat cultivars of different duration can potentially balance the yield-reducing risks of frost, heat and terminal drought. Cultivar mixtures with contrasting duration were tested across three experiments in Western Australia. Experiment 1 consisted of three sowing dates (early, mid and late), experiment 2 consisted one sowing date and experiment 3 consisted of two sowing dates (early and late). The three experiments and the multiple sowing dates created differences in the exposure to frost, heat and terminal drought risk. Seven treatments were established in each environment, consisting of three commercially-available cultivars (long, mid and short-duration); together with each of the two- and three-cultivar mixtures of these cultivars. In experiment 1 yields of the single cultivars showed the expected pattern with the long duration cultivar having the highest yield when sown early and the short duration cultivar having the higher yield when sown late. There were few differences in yield in experiments 2 and 3. Only a single treatment, a mixture of the long and mid-duration cultivars, was either the highest yielding or not significantly different from the highest yielding across all environments. In experiment 1 there was evidence of over-yielding with the mean of all the mixtures being 6.4% greater (P = 0.043) than the mean of the individual cultivars across the three sowing dates. This research has demonstrated that wheat cultivar mixtures can stabilise the combined risks of frost, heat and drought stress in frost and heat-prone dryland environments, providing growers with a strategy to manage these uncertain risks.

However, only few studies have quantified the production and emission potentials for long-and short-lived gaseous nitrogen (N) species simultaneously in agricultural soils. To link the gaseous N species to intermediate N compounds [ammonium (NH4+), hydroxylamine (NH2OH), and nitrite (NO2  )] and estimate their temperature change potential, ex-situ dry-out experiments were conducted with three Chinese agricultural soils. We found that HONO and NOx (NO + NO2) emissions mainly depend on NO2 , while NH3 and N2O emissions are stimulated by NH4+ and NH2OH, respectively. Addition of 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) and acetylene significantly reduced HONO and NOx emissions, while NH3 emissions were significantly enhanced in an alkaline Fluvo-aquic soil. These results suggested that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and complete ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (comammox Nitrospira) dominate HONO and NOx emissions in the alkaline Fluvo-aquic soil, while ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are dominant in the acidic Mollisol. DMPP effectively mitigated the warming effect in the Fluvo-aquic soil and the Ultisol. In conclusion, our findings highlight NO2  significantly stimulates HONO and NOx emissions from dryland agricultural soils, dominated by nitrification. In addition, subtle differences of soil NH3, N2O, HONO, and NOx emissions indicated different N turnover processes, and should be considered in biogeochemical and atmospheric chemistry models.

However, ecological restoration in drylands is strongly limited by water resources. Therefore, a technical route for ecological resto-ration in drylands that creates sustainable landscapes based on those water constraints is needed. In this study, we develop a spatially explicit framework named "Constraint-Pattern-Benefit" to plan ecological restoration patterns in Inner Mongolia, China. Based on a prediction of the ecosystem service (ES) increase under limited evapotranspiration as a water constraint, we constructed 5 landscape sustainability-related strategies with 100 ecological restoration scenarios, which considered fragmentation of restoration locations, distance to city, water consumption, and the allocation scale to determine the spatial arrangement of ecological restoration. Results show that the ES increase potential of ecological restoration under water constraints is distributed in the center of Inner Mongolia. The multi-objective scenario simultaneously achieves 59.1% water yield, 74.2% soil conser-vation, 57.2% sand fixation, and 52.8% carbon sequestration with 50% restored landscape. Considering the indicators of fragmentation, water consumption, and distance to city decreases the restored landscape frag-mentation from 0.44 to 0.26, improves the restoration efficiency by 14.41%, and increases the beneficiary population by 35.5%, respectively. Small-scale allocation can further increase the ES realization efficiency, which is on average 4.8% higher at the city scale than at the provincial scale. Moreover, this approach focuses on the sustainable effect of the spatial arrangement on dryland landscapes at different scales, which provides methodological support for improving the sustainability of drylands.

Deep-time perspectives are necessary to better understand the periodicity of fire events and to identify basic drivers of frequent fire episodes through time, including potential anthropogenic fire use. Our study contributes to the growing field of archeological fire ecology in the Southwest with an examination of a high-resolution geobotanical dataset for Holocene fire regimes as indicated within sediments from an alluvial section from Tesuque Creek in northern New Mexico. Using phytolith, geochemical, and sedimentological data, we reconstruct indices for burn cycle seasonality and destabilization of riparian vegetation communities that suggest potential anthropogenic land use and possible patterns distinguishing human burning from lightning ignitions. Through this study, we consider the potential role of hunter-gatherer behavior in producing fire landscapes as part of their strategies for managing risks in the fragile environments of the Middle-Late Holocene in northern New Mexico. We suggest that combining geo and botanical datasets from alluvial sections with archeological evidence will allow researchers to fine-tune the resolution of local climate sequences and their environmental impacts on small landscape scales. When such small-scale studies can be aggregated, they may further contribute to testing models of regional patch-burning, either natural or anthropogenic. We further posit that human relationships with fire in the past should be considered as collaborative efforts with lightning-ignited burns, to manage the risks associated with both too much and too little fire in fragile dryland ecosystems.

In drylands, grassland biomass is highly heterogeneous in space and time. It is difficult to achieve sustainable utilization of grassland resources by focusing only on the average annual carrying capacity assessment obtained from grass yield. Here, we proposed a novel approach for assessing grassland carrying capacity, taking Zhenglan Banner (County) in Inner Mongolia as the study area. First, monthly grass yield at 30 m spatial resolution was estimated, derived from Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model and spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM). Then, based on the degree of sand mobility and degradation condition of typical steppe, the utilization patterns for sandy land and typical steppe in different grazing seasons were developed separately to obtain available grass yield. Finally, the carrying capacity at the Gacha (Village)-scale was estimated and the current livestock carrying status was evaluated to facilitate the grassland refined management. In Zhenglan Banner, the carrying capacity was 237.46 thousand cattle-units in summer. The grassland resources are being overgrazed, with an overload rate of 19.32%. At Gacha-scale, the maximum reasonable stock density was ranged from 0.06 cattle-unit/ha to 0.42 cattle-unit/ha. Fifty-one Gachas exhibited livestock overload. This study is expected to provide technical support and scientific reference data for ecological conservation and grassland management in the study area, as well as in dryland pastoral areas of northern China.

Crop rotation, irrigation system, and irrigation rate on cotton yield in southwestern Georgia	CROP FORAGE & TURFGRASS MANAGEMENT												Long-term yield data would be useful for determining crop rotation, irrigation system selection, and irrigation rate for maximum production and economic sustainability. Research was conducted at the USDA-ARS National Peanut Research Laboratory's Multi-crop Irrigation Research Farm in Shellman, GA (84 degrees 36 '' W, 30 degrees 44 '' N), on a Greenville fine sandy loam (a fine, kaolinitic, thermic Rhodic Kandiudult) soil with 0-2% slope. This long-term study (2001-2013) compared three irrigation systems, three cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) crop rotations, and various irrigation rates on cotton lint yield and quality factors. Irrigation systems were sprinkler, subsurface drip (SSDI), and shallow subsurface drip (S3DI) irrigation compared with a dryland control. Irrigation rates were 100,66,50,33, and 0% of estimated water use. Crop rotations were (a) cotton-corn (Zea mays L.)-peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), (b) cotton-cotton-peanut; and (c) cotton-peanutcotton. There was no difference in cotton yield by crop rotation. Sprinkler and S3DI systems had greater lint yield than the SSDI system at the 100% irrigation level when averaged across all years and rotations. Lint yield tended to be lower in high rainfall years without respect to irrigation system. Irrigation increased lint yield by an average 10% when rainfall was less than average. All fiber quality factors were within acceptable ranges without any value discounts across years, rotation, or irrigation system. Irrigation system selection should not be based entirely on long-term yield information but also on field size, system installation cost, irrigation system controls, and crop management.
