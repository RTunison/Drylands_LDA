Vegetation dynamics in African drylands: an assessment based on the Vegetation Degradation Index in an agro-pastoral region of Botswana	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												Changes in vegetation conditions are induced both by climatic and human factors. Knowledge about how changes in vegetation conditions relate to its degradation is often lacking, although needed to sustainably manage rangeland resources in drylands. Contributions made to develop land management options require assessing vegetation dynamics and degradation in Palapye, an agro-pastoral region of high economic and biodiversity importance in eastern Botswana. The Vegetation Degradation Index (VDI) was applied to 18-year (1986-2016) time series of annual Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ANDVI) images to establish vegetation degradation levels, i.e. relatively undegraded, low degradation, medium degradation, and high degradation. Plant species metrics and biophysical variables were then examined at nine sites with the aim of explaining variations in the vegetation degradation levels. Approximately 95% of the study area experienced low degradation and 11% had significant negative trends in ANDVI. Species richness, diversity, and rainfall explained 49% of the variance in degradation levels. Species diversity and richness were highest in Moeng (a relatively undegraded site), whereas they were lowest in Lesenopole (a low degradation site). A probable reason being that Colophospermum mopane contributed 87% of individual trees and shrubs at Lesenopole. Species diversity and richness were also negatively associated with VDI. The non-occurrence of some species such as Sclerocarya birrea and Lonchocarpus capassa on highly degraded sites suggests a link between species composition and the level of degradation. This study combined the use of theremote sensing-based VDI with field-based plant species data for validating vegetation degradation levels in a dryland context.

HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The semiarid northeast of Brazil is one of the most densely populated dryland regions in the world and recurrently affected by severe droughts. Thus, reliable seasonal forecasts of streamflow and reservoir storage are of high value for water managers. Such forecasts can be generated by applying either hydrological models representing underlying processes or statistical relationships exploiting correlations among meteorological and hydrological variables. This work evaluates and compares the performances of seasonal reservoir storage forecasts derived by a process-based hydrological model and a statistical approach. Driven by observations, both models achieve similar simulation accuracies. In a hindcast experiment, however, the accuracy of estimating regional reservoir storages was considerably lower using the process-based hydrological model, whereas the resolution and reliability of drought event predictions were similar by both approaches. Further investigations regarding the deficiencies of the process-based model revealed a significant influence of antecedent wetness conditions and a higher sensitivity of model prediction performance to rainfall forecast quality. Within the scope of this study, the statistical model proved to be the more straightforward approach for predictions of reservoir level and drought events at regionally and monthly aggregated scales. However, for forecasts at finer scales of space and time or for the investigation of underlying processes, the costly initialisation and application of a process-based model can be worthwhile. Furthermore, the application of innovative data products, such as remote sensing data, and operational model correction methods, like data assimilation, may allow for an enhanced exploitation of the advanced capabilities of process-based hydrological models.

Land-Atmosphere Coupling Constrains Increases to Potential Evaporation in a Warming Climate: Implications at Local and Global Scales	EARTHS FUTURE												The magnitude and extent of runoff reduction, drought intensification, and dryland expansion under climate change are unclear and contentious. A primary reason is disagreement between global circulation models and current potential evaporation (PE) models for the upper limit of evaporation under warming climatic conditions. An emerging body of research suggests that current PE models including Penman-Monteith and Priestley-Taylor may overestimate future evaporation for non-water-stressed conditions. However, they are still widely used for climatic impact analysis although the underlying physical mechanisms for PE projections remain unclear. Here, we show that current PE models diverge from observed non-water-stressed evaporation across site (> 1,500 flux tower site years), watershed (> 10,000 watershed-years), and global (25 climate models) scales. By not incorporating land-atmosphere coupling processes, current models overestimate non-water-stressed evaporation and its driving factors for warmer and drier conditions. To resolve this, we introduce a land-atmosphere coupled PE model by extending the Surface Flux Equilibrium theory. The proposed PE model accurately reproduces non-water-stressed evaporation across spatiotemporal scales. We find that terrestrial PE will increase at a similar rate to ocean evaporation but much slower than rates suggested by current PE models. This finding suggests that land-atmosphere coupling moderates continental drying trends. Budyko-based runoff projections incorporating our PE model are well aligned with those from coupled climate simulations, implying that land-atmosphere coupling is key to improving predictions of climatic impacts on water resources. Our approach provides a simple and robust way to incorporate coupled land-atmosphere processes into water management tools.

However, the importance and mechanism of UV radiation on litter decomposition, especially on standing litter, in humid forest ecosystems remain unclear. We conducted a factorial experiment in a humid subtropical forest gap, manipulating the effects of UV radiation on the decomposition of standing litter under different microbial conditions. After 366 days of standing incubation, under normal conditions (UV pass with microorganisms), up to 40.63% of the litter mass was lost. However, under a UV pass without microorganisms, litter mass loss was only 16.30%. Under a UV block, the mass loss of litter with microorganisms was 27.68% and that of litter without microorganisms was 15.54%. Without microorganisms, UV radiation had no significant effect on the mass loss of litter carbon. However, UV radiation increased the DOC concentration of litter. And in the presence of microorganisms, UV radiation contributed to an increased mass loss of lignin by 16.72% and of cellulose by 14.75%. No negative effects of UV radiation on microorganisms were observed. These results suggest that UV radiation increased the net mass loss of litter by 106.67%, and this doubling promotion was achieved through microbial degradation. Synthesis. The increase in microbial degradation under UV radiation may be linked to the increased degradability of lignin and cellulose caused by photodegradation. Our study indicates that direct photodegradation by UV radiation could be weak in subtropical forests, but UV photofacilitation generates rapid turnover of carbon in this system.

Subsurface banding poultry litter influences edamame yield, forage quality, and leaf greenness	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Poultry litter is generated in large quantities throughout the southeastern United States and is an excellent nutrient source for increasing crop yields. However, surface applications result in nutrient losses to air, soil, and water. Subsurface banding poultry litter is a promising technology for reducing nutrient losses to surface and groundwater, but information is needed on optimum crop seeding distance from bands. This study evaluated edamame [Glycine max (L.) Merr. 'Edamame'] yield (residue, pod, and total plant), crop quality, and leaf greenness. Subsurface banded poultry litter and crop row distances (13, 25, and 38 cm) were compared with surface-applied poultry litter (all received 168 kg ha(-1) total N) under irrigated and nonirrigated conditions from 2019 to 2020. Both chlorophyll and edamame total yields were greatest (P <= .05) under subsurface banding litter, relative to surface applications, regardless of distance. Overall, greatest total crop yields were observed for 13- and 25-cm banding distances under irrigation and the 38-cm distance, irrespective of irrigation, relative to surface applications. Residue nutritive value for the 13-cm distance was greater under irrigation than dryland. Both systems provided high levels of nutritive residual mass, thus edamame could be used as a vegetable crop and a forage following harvest. Overall, subsurface banding poultry litter in conservation tillage systems is a viable replacement to surface applications for edamame production (vegetable and fodder), particularly in organic systems. Results can be used to develop nutrient management plans for organic edamame and other specialty crop production systems in the Mid-South.

Unprecedented changes in these environments over the past few decades are likely to intensify in the future and land users need to develop sustainable adaptation strategies. This study aims to identify land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes and their drivers in a sub-Saharan dryland, between 1986 and 2017, by integrating local knowledge and remote sensing. Local knowledge and environmental perception are used as the basis for defining LULC classes and for training and validation of change detection. This study detects significant LULC changes in 41% of the investigated area, and identifies bush encroachment into former pastures as the dominant LULC change with an increase of woodland by 39% and a decrease of grassland by 74%. This process is perceived as severe degradation by local respondents and is linked to changing management regimes and unreliable rainfall patterns. Deforestation and woodland thinning account for 44% of the detected changes, and can be traced back to increased habitation and farming, although the local community also identifies charcoal production as a driving factor. The integration of remote sensing and local knowledge provides a holistic view on LULC change in Pokot Central, Kenya and offers a solid base for site-specific and actor-centred management approaches necessary for sustainable pathways of drylands. Our results emphasize the need to include local actors in the development of adaptation strategies and management guidelines for drylands.

Muted responses to chronic experimental nitrogen deposition on the Colorado Plateau	OECOLOGIA												Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition is significantly altering both community structure and ecosystem processes in terrestrial ecosystems across the globe. However, our understanding of the consequences of N deposition in dryland systems remains relatively poor, despite evidence that drylands may be particularly vulnerable to increasing N inputs. In this study, we investigated the influence of 7 years of multiple levels of simulated N deposition (0, 2, 5, and 8 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) on plant community structure and biological soil crust (biocrust) cover at three semi-arid grassland sites spanning a soil texture gradient. Biocrusts are a surface community of mosses, lichens, cyanobacteria, and/or algae, and have been shown to be sensitive to N inputs. We hypothesized that N additions would decrease plant diversity, increase abundance of the invasive annual grass Bromus tectorum, and decrease biocrust cover. Contrary to our expectations, we found that N additions did not affect plant diversity or B. tectorum abundance. In partial support of our hypotheses, N additions negatively affected biocrust cover in some years, perhaps driven in part by inter-annual differences in precipitation. Soil inorganic N concentrations showed rapid but ephemeral responses to N additions and plant foliar N concentrations showed no response, indicating that the magnitude of plant and biocrust responses to N fertilization may be buffered by endogenous N cycling. More work is needed to determine N critical load thresholds for plant community and biocrust dynamics in semi-arid systems and the factors that determine the fate of N inputs.

In recent decades, the continuous expansion of agriculture towards the dryland areas has favored the introduction and establishment of potential pests, such as arthropods, that may affect forestry crops and transmit zoonotic diseases. We analyzed the arthropod assemblages that were of forestry and medical-veterinary importance in the Limari basin. After reviewing historical data, specimen collections, and the available literature, a total of 10 families, 39 genera, and 51 species of arthropods of forestry importance were recorded, 43.1% of which were of quarantine importance. Xylophagous groups of quarantine importance to the US included Cryptotermes brevis (Kalotermitidae), Neoterius mystax (Bostrichidae), Tyndaris planata (Buprestidae), Rhyephenes humeralis (Curculionidae) and Phoracantha recurva (Cerambycidae). Other quarantine insects of forestry importance recorded in the area included were Micrapate scabrata and Polycaon chilensis (Bostrichidae). In addition, the groups of medical-veterinary importance were represented by 11 families, 14 genera, and 18 species, 9 of which were arachnids and 9 were insects. Among the identified arachnids, the most important genera were Loxosceles (Sicariidae), Latrodectus, Steatoda (Theridiidae) and Rhipicephalus (Ixodidae), whereas among the identified insects, the most important were Triatoma and Mepraia (Reduviidae), Pediculus (Pediculidae), and Ceratophyllus (Ceratophyllidae). We hope this study serves as a basis for the development of forest pest monitoring and control programs as well as an understanding of the potential risks posed by zoonotic agents and their implications for public health.

With climate change, heat, and drought stresses have become more frequent and intense in lentil growing areas with a strong influence on phenology, grain yield, and nutritional quality. This study aimed to assess the impact of heat and drought stresses on phenology, grain yield, and nutritional quality of lentil. For this purpose, 100 lentil genotypes from the global collection were evaluated under normal, heat, and combined heat-drought conditions. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences (p < 0.001) among lentil genotypes for phenological traits, yield components, and grain quality traits. Under no stress conditions, mineral concentrations among lentil genotypes varied from 48 to 109 mg kg(-1) for iron (Fe) and from 31 to 65 mg kg(-1) for zinc (Zn), while crude protein content ranged from 22.5 to 32.0%. Iron, zinc, and crude protein content were significantly reduced under stress conditions, and the effect of combined heat-drought stress was more severe than heat stress alone. A significant positive correlation was observed between iron and zinc concentrations under both no stress and stress conditions. Based on grain yield, crude protein, and iron and zinc concentrations, lentil genotypes were grouped into three clusters following the hierarchical cluster analysis. Promising lentil genotypes with high micronutrient contents, crude protein, and grain yield with the least effect of heat and drought stress were identified as the potential donors for biofortification in the lentil breeding program.

A Genome-Wide Association Study of Nigerien and Senegalese Sorghum Germplasm of <i>Exserohilum turcicum</i>, the Causal Agent of Leaf Blight	PLANTS-BASEL												In Senegal, sorghum ranks third after millet and maize among dryland cereal production and plays a critical role in the daily lives of millions of inhabitants. Yet, the crop's productivity and profitability are hampered by biotic stresses, including Exserohilum turcicum, causing leaf blight. A total of 101 sorghum accessions collected from Niger and Senegal, SC748-5 and BTx623, were evaluated in three different environments (Kaymor, Kolda, and Ndiaganiao) in Senegal for their reactions against the leaf blight pathogen. The results showed that 11 out of the 101 accessions evaluated exhibited 100% incidence, and the overall mean incidence was 88.4%. Accession N15 had the lowest incidence of 50%. The overall mean severity was 31.6%, while accessions N15, N43, N38, N46, N30, N28, and N23 from Niger recorded the lowest severity levels, ranging from 15.5% to 25.5%. Accession N15 exhibited both low leaf blight incidence and severity, indicating that it may possess genes for resistance to E. turcicum. Also, the accessions evaluated in this study were sequenced. A GWAS identified six novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with an average leaf blight incidence rate. The candidate genes were found in chromosomes 2, 3, 5, 8, and 9. Except for SNP locus S05_48064154, all five SNPs associated with the leaf blight incidence rate were associated with the plant defense and stress responses. In conclusion, the candidate genes identified could offer additional options for enhancing plant resistance against E. turcicum through plant breeding or gene editing.

Mechanical control inadvertently increases risk of alien plant invasion: influence of stem fragmentation and inundation regimes on Arundo donax regeneration in Neotropical savanna	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Context. Arundo donax L. is an exotic, perennial grass that has invaded dryland and wetland savannas of central Brazil. This species produces sterile flowers in its introduced range and propagates vegetatively via rhizomes and stem fragments. Aims. We investigated bud sprouting capacity after fragmentation, which plays a major role in plant-proliferation ability, invasiveness and its escape from weed-control measures. Methods. We evaluated the effects of size, different periods of desiccation (by exposure to air), submersion and water-column height on the regenerative capacity of single-node stem fragments. Key results. Fragments of a minimum size of 3-4 cm successfully regenerated new plants. The regenerative capacity of single-node stem fragments (3-10 cm length) rapidly decreased after 1 week of air desiccation. Stem fragments that were submerged for 30 days resprouted and formed plants in a water column of 5, 10 or 15 cm, with no significant difference from the controls. However, leaves did not expand and shoot elongation was adversely affected in 15 cm of non-aerated water. This loss of performance was reversed when the newly formed plants were removed from the water and transferred to a moist substrate. Implications. Our findings suggest that weed management, which involves cutting the plant to ground level without removing it from the site, is inefficient and can intensify the potential for invasion by A. donax, especially in the rainy season, when left-over stem fragments remain hydrated and capable of regeneration. Its establishment near riverbanks must be monitored because submerged propagules remain viable and able to resprout.

Todd			Growth, boll development, agronomic performance, and fiber quality of <i>Gossypium barbadense</i> L. in the southeastern US Coastal Plain	CROP SCIENCE												Pima (Gossypium barbadense L.) cotton is currently grown commercially in the western United States and has exceptional fiber quality, which provides an economic value almost two times greater than Upland (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cotton. Due to limited experience with Pima production in the southeastern United States, our primary objective was to compare the growth, development, agronomic performance, and fiber quality of four Pima genotypes with a high-yielding high fiber quality commercial Upland cultivar under irrigated and dryland conditions at different planting dates. Lint yields of all Pima genotypes were similar to 50% less and had lower lint percentages (38.0-42.4%) than the Upland genotype (45.7%); however, the Pima genotypes had consistently lower micronaire values and increased fiber strength, length, and uniformity. Although irrigation did not significantly impact agronomic and fiber quality performance, plants grown under supplemental irrigation developed 10% more bolls throughout the season, mostly occurring on monopodial branches and at mainstem nodal positions above 15. Bolls on Pima genotypes were 13-34% smaller than the Upland genotype and developed at more distal and higher nodal positions in the plant canopy. The highest net returns were found in 2019 at the early planting date, displaying the importance of timely planting of Pima genotypes when grown in the southeastern United States. Results suggest that irrigation may not be required for Pima production in the southeast, early planting is preferred to obtain maximum yields, and increasing lint percent, boll number, or earliness through breeding may improve Pima yields in the southeastern United States.

Temporal Effects of Monsoon Rainfall Pulses on Plant Available Nitrogen in a Chihuahuan Desert Grassland	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Drylands are often characterized by a pulse dynamics framework in which episodic rain events trigger brief pulses of biological activity and resource availability that regulate primary production. In the northern Chihuahuan Desert, growing season precipitation typically comes from monsoon rainstorms that stimulate soil microbial processes like decomposition, releasing inorganic nitrogen needed by plant processes. Compared to microbes, plants require greater amounts of soil moisture, typically from larger monsoon storms predicted to become less frequent and more intense in the future. Yet field-based studies linking rainfall pulses with soil nutrient dynamics are rare. Consequently, little is known about how changes in rainfall patterns may affect plant available nitrogen in dryland soils, particularly across temporal scales. We measured daily and seasonal responses of soil inorganic nitrogen and related parameters to experimentally applied small frequent and large infrequent rain events throughout a summer growing season in a Chihuahuan Desert grassland. Contrary to long-standing theories around resource pulse dynamics in drylands, nitrogen availability did not pulse following experimental rain events. Moreover, large infrequent events resulted in significantly less plant available nitrogen despite causing distinct pulses of increased soil moisture availability that persisted for several days. Overall, nitrogen availability increased over the growing season, especially following small frequent rain events that also stimulated some microbial ecoenzymatic activities. Our results suggest that projected changes in climate to fewer, larger rain events could significantly impact primary production in desert grasslands by decreasing plant available nitrogen when soil moisture is least limiting to plant growth.

Mapping and quantifying agricultural irrigation in heterogeneous landscapes using Google Earth Engine	REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT												Geospatial analysis using remote sensing data has emerged as an effective tool to monitor irrigated lands over a variety of climatic conditions and locations. Humid and heterogeneous landscapes such as those in the South Atlantic Coastal Plain are challenging for satellite image classification over large spatial extents. The objectives of this study are to: 1) compile relevant vegetation indices for mapping and quantifying irrigated and dryland agricultural areas across the coastal plain region of South Carolina, USA; 2) identify the spatial and temporal change of the agricultural irrigation areas in the region over time; 3) compare the results to county-level statistics reported by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in the study area. In this study, a framework has been developed to regularly monitor irrigated agriculture's extent and distribution using high-spatial-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery for the coastal plain of South Carolina region using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The maps were produced using random forest supervised classification for three years with overall accuracy assessments of 83.73% (2016), 86.18% (2017), and 84.55% (2018). The major irrigated crops in the study area are corn, cotton, soybeans, and peanuts. Overall, the irrigated crops' distribution areas were mainly concentrated in counties near the center of the studied region. The produced maps will provide valuable information for the development of irrigated agriculture and the optimization of irrigation water use in the region. The methodology followed in this study can be applied to any other regions around the world with similar landscapes and climatic conditions.

GENOTYPES	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												Brassica rapa L. can provide important genetic diversity for crop improvement with rotation benefits to dryland wheat. It can also be cultivated on marginal areas and can serve as a source of biofuel production. This research aimed to determine the highest yielding genotypes for a specific environment may be useful for breeders and farmers. The yield and yield components of five pure genotypes were analysed in four environments obtained through the combination of two locations and two years of harvest in a three-replicates design. The highest and lowest mean values of the examined properties in genotypes were detected as 133.073.9 cm in plant height, 8.9-5.7 in branches plant(-1), 292.4-125.3 in pods plant-1, 2.24-1.62 g in thousand seed weight, 1655.5-576.0 kg ha(-1) in seed yield and 506.4-140.6 kg ha(-1) in crude oil yield. Considering the performance of genotypes, the most suitable genotype in term of seed yield and crude oil yield and environment were determined as Genotype 3 (Tokat), Environment 4 (Ikizce 2018-2019). Results of this study indicate that, the Genotype 3 can be registered as a variety for specified regions. The would be new variety or the Genotype 3 appeared to be superior in performance and stability for crude oil yield and has higher values compared to the means of other genotypes. Thus, this genotype was the best candidate variety and recommended in all of the studied environments or included in breeding programme to develop high yielding and stable genotypes.

Multi-temporal yield pattern analysis method for deriving yield zones in crop production systems	PRECISION AGRICULTURE												Easy-to-use tools using modern data analysis techniques are needed to handle spatio-temporal agri-data. This research proposes a novel pattern recognition-based method, Multi-temporal Yield Pattern Analysis (MYPA), to reveal long-term (> 10 years) spatio-temporal variations in multi-temporal yield data. The specific objectives are: i) synthesis of information within multiple yield maps into a single understandable and interpretable layer that is indicative of the variability and stability in yield over a 10 + years period, and ii) evaluation of the hypothesis that the MYPA enhances multi-temporal yield interpretation compared to commonly-used statistical approaches. The MYPA method automatically identifies potential erroneous yield maps; detects yield patterns using principal component analysis; evaluates temporal yield pattern stability using a per-pixel analysis; and generates productivity-stability units based on k-means clustering and zonal statistics. The MYPA method was applied to two commercial cereal fields in Australian dryland systems and two commercial fields in a UK cool-climate system. To evaluate the MYPA, its output was compared to results from a classic, statistical yield analysis on the same data sets. The MYPA explained more of the variance in the yield data and generated larger and more coherent yield zones that are more amenable to site-specific management. Detected yield patterns were associated with varying production conditions, such as soil properties, precipitation patterns and management decisions. The MYPA was demonstrated as a robust approach that can be encoded into an easy-to-use tool to produce information layers from a time-series of yield data to support management.

Corn Response Across Plant Densities and Row Configurations for Different Moisture Environments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												Corn (Zea mays L.) production in the Southeast can be negatively impacted by erratic summer rainfall and drought-prone, coarse-textured soils, but irrigation combined with conservation tillage and cover crops may support greater plant densities arranged in different row configurations to improve yield. We examined five site-years of data across two soil types in Alabama to compare corn yields in a conservation system across three plant densities for single- and twin-row configurations in dryland and irrigated moisture regimes. Treatments were arranged with a split plot treatment restriction in a RCB design with three replications. Main plots were irrigation level (no irrigation and irrigation), and subplots were a factorial arrangement of three plant densities (5.9, 7.4, and 8.9 plants m(-2)) and row configurations (single and twin). A moisture environment (low and moderate) variable, defined by growing season rainfall, was used to average over site-years. In general, irrigation in the moderate-moisture environment improved each measured variable (plant height, stover yield, corn yield, and test weight) and decreased grain N concentration and aflatoxin levels compared to the low-moisture environment with no irrigation. Benefits of increased rainfall and irrigation to reduce soil moisture stress across drought-prone soils were evident. Pooled results across all site-years indicated no yield response as plant density increased, but greater yields were observed with the greatest plant densities in the moderate-moisture environments. No advantage for twin-row corn production was observed across five site-years in Alabama, which indicates either row configuration can be successfully adopted.

Microsite enhancements for soil stabilization and rapid biocrust colonization in degraded drylands	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												In dryland ecosystems, natural recovery of biological soil crusts (biocrusts) following disturbance may be slow or inhibited, necessitating active restoration practices. While biocrusts can be readily propagated under environmentally controlled conditions, rehabilitation in the field is complicated by environmental stresses which may be particularly acute in degraded, destabilized soils with harsh climatic conditions at the soil surface. In this study, we first present the results of a field trial at a severely degraded rangeland site examining the stabilizing effects of various soil amendments (polysaccharide glues and polyacrylamides) in combination with biocrust inoculum. We found that a psyllium compound was the only amendment to maintain effectiveness after 19 months, and the only treatment that maintained biocrust inoculum throughout the trial. In a subsequent short-term experiment where plots were shaded and watered, we examined how biocrust inoculation rate (0, 20, and 40% initial cover) and the psyllium-based amendment affected biocrust growth. After 4 months, visible biocrust cover in inoculated plots was greater than in controls, but only chlorophyll a exhibited a dosage-response to inoculum application rate, indicating preferential establishment of cyanobacteria. Psyllium did not affect biocrust development but did improve soil stability. Shade and watering buffered against temperature extremes (up to 15 degrees C) and increased the duration of moist surface conditions necessary for biocrust growth by up to 30%, mimicking conditions more common in the fall and winter months. Our results suggest that inducing early successional biocrusts on a highly degraded site is possible with suitable microclimate conditions.

Using spatially variable nitrogen application and crop responses to evaluate crop nitrogen use efficiency	NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS												Low nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is ubiquitous in agricultural systems, with mounting global scale consequences for both atmospheric aspects of climate and downstream ecosystems. Since NUE-related soil characteristics such as water holding capacity and organic matter are likely to vary at small scales (< 1 ha), understanding the influence of soil characteristics on NUE at the subfield scale (< 32 ha) could increase fertilizer NUE. Here, we quantify NUE in four conventionally managed dryland winter-wheat fields in Montana following multiple years of sub-field scale variation in experimental N fertilizer applications. To inform farmer decisions that incorporates NUE, we developed a generalizable model to predict subfield scale NUE by comparing six candidate models, using ecological and biogeochemical data gathered from open-source data repositories and from normal farm operations, including yield and protein monitoring data. While NUE varied across fields and years, efficiency was highest in areas of fields with low N availability from both fertilizer and estimated mineralization of soil organic N (SON). At low levels of applied N, distinct responses among fields suggest distinct capacities to supply non-fertilizer plant-available N, suggesting that mineralization supplies more available N in locations with higher total N, reducing efficiency for any applied rate. Comparing modelling approaches, a random forest regression model of NUE provided predictions with the least error relative to observed NUE. Subfield scale predictive models of NUE can help to optimize efficiency in agronomic systems, maximizing both economic net return and NUE, which provides a valuable approach for optimization of nitrogen fertilizer use.					jones, clain a/F-1111-2013	Maxwell, Bruce/0000-0001-7775-9419; Hegedus, Paul/0000-0002-6288-4345													1385-1314	1573-0867				MAY	2023	126	1					1	20		10.1007/s10705-023-10263-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-023-10263-3		MAR 2023											WOS:000952391600001
J	Davies, KW; Bates, JD; Svejcar, L				Davies, Kirk W.; Bates, Jon D.; Svejcar, Lauren			Native lagomorphs prolong legacy effects limiting restoration of imperiled shrub-steppe communities	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Over the last +150 years, increases in woody vegetation in drylands and associated declines in herbaceous vegetation have led to widespread interest in reversing this trend. However, the effects of native, noncharismatic herbivores, such as lagomorphs, on these efforts are largely unknown. For 11 years post-treatment, we quantified the effects of native lagomorphs on restoration efforts in sagebrush (Artemisia L.) communities exhibiting legacy effects of past management, including depleted understories and overabundant sagebrush. Reducing sagebrush and seeding perennial grasses was necessary to attain substantial increases in large perennial grass cover and density, but this outcome was realized only with lagomorph exclusion. A small native bunchgrass and perennial forb cover and density increased in all treatments with lagomorph exclusion. This suggests that lagomorphs contribute to the persistence of a depleted understory in areas with increased woody vegetation. In areas where sagebrush was reduced, the cover and density of sagebrush was greater with lagomorph exclusion. This suggests that lagomorphs could hinder sagebrush recovery after disturbances that reduce or eliminate sagebrush. Lagomorph herbivory had a substantial effect on vegetation dynamics and affected the outcome of restoration efforts in these dryland systems. This could reduce livestock forage and alter habitat of wildlife species, potentially affecting their conservation. Lagomorphs and other noncharismatic, native herbivores may facilitate the persistence of depleted understories in areas where woody plants have increased. Results of this study suggests that the potential effects of lagomorph and other native herbivores should be considered and addressed in management, restoration, and conservation plans.																			1061-2971	1526-100X				MAY	2023	31	4								10.1111/rec.13882	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.13882		FEB 2023											WOS:000936813500001

Cinta; de Leon, Natalia			Unoccupied aerial systems discovered overlooked loci capturing the variation of entire growing period in maize	PLANT GENOME												Traditional phenotyping methods, coupled with genetic mapping in segregating populations, have identified loci governing complex traits in many crops. Unoccupied aerial systems (UAS)-based phenotyping has helped to reveal a more novel and dynamic relationship between time-specific associated loci with complex traits previously unable to be evaluated. Over 1,500 maize (Zea mays L.) hybrid row plots containing 280 different replicated maize hybrids from the Genomes to Fields (G2F) project were evaluated agronomically and using UAS in 2017. Weekly UAS flights captured variation in plant heights during the growing season under three different management conditions each year: optimal planting with irrigation (G2FI), optimal dryland planting without irrigation (G2FD), and a stressed late planting (G2LA). Plant height of different flights were ranked based on importance for yield using a random forest (RF) algorithm. Plant heights captured by early flights in G2FI trials had higher importance (based on Gini scores) for predicting maize grain yield (GY) but also higher accuracies in genomic predictions which fluctuated for G2FD (- 0.06 similar to 0.73), G2FI (0.33 similar to 0.76), and G2LA (0.26 similar to 0.78) trials. A genomewide association analysis discovered 52 significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), seven were found consistently in more than one flights or trial; 45 were flight or trial specific. Total cumulative marker effects for each chromosome's contributions to plant height also changed depending on flight. Using UAS phenotyping, this study showed that many candidate genes putatively play a role in the regulation of plant architecture even in relatively early stages of maize growth and development.

J	Huang, H; Yie, KL; D'Odorico, P				Huang, Heng; Yie, Kailiang; D'Odorico, Paolo			CAM plant expansion favored indirectly by asymmetric climate warming and increased rainfall variability	OECOLOGIA												Recent observational evidence suggests that nighttime temperatures are increasing faster than daytime temperatures, while in some regions precipitation events are becoming less frequent and more intense. The combined ecological impacts of these climatic changes on crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants and their interactions with other functional groups (i.e., grass communities) remain poorly understood. Here we developed a growth chamber experiment to investigate how two CAM-grass communities in desert ecosystems of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico respond to asymmetric warming and increasing rainfall variability. Grasses generally showed competitive advantages over CAM plants with increasing rainfall variability under ambient temperature conditions. In contrast, asymmetric warming caused mortality of both grass species (Bouteloua eriopoda and Bouteloua curtipendula) in both rainfall treatments due to enhanced drought stress. Grass mortality indirectly favored CAM plants even though the biomass of both CAM species Cylindropuntia imbricata and Opuntia phaeacantha significantly decreased. The stem's volume-to-surface ratio of C. imbricata was significantly higher in mixture than in monoculture under ambient temperature (both P < 0.0014); however, the difference became insignificant under asymmetric warming (both P > 0.1625), suggesting that warming weakens the negative effects of interspecific competition on CAM plant growth. Our findings suggest that while the increase in intra-annual rainfall variability enhances grass productivity, asymmetric warming may lead to grass mortality, thereby indirectly favoring the expansion of co-existing CAM plants. This study provides novel experimental evidence showing how the ongoing changes in global warming and rainfall variability affect CAM-grass growth and interactions in dryland ecosystems.

Hydrological function of rapidly induced biocrusts	ECOHYDROLOGY												In dryland ecosystems, land degradation and erosion pose severe threats to ecosystem productivity and human well-being. Bio-inoculation of degraded soils with native biological soil crusts (biocrusts) is a promising yet relatively untested means to improve soil stability and hydrological function (i.e., increase infiltration and reduce run-off). In a degraded semiarid grassland on the Colorado Plateau, we studied the establishment and hydrological function (via simulated rainfall) of induced biocrusts grown with and without an organic soil stabilizer (psyllium, derived from Plantago sp.), after a period of 4months. We found evidence of biocrust establishment, including significantly higher biocrust cover, chlorophyll a, and exopolysaccharides in inoculated plots compared with controls. Plots inoculated with biocrust had higher run-off and sediment yields than controls during rainfall simulation. However, this effect was mitigated in plots where stabilizer was added, resulting in greater soil aggregate stability and higher levels of infiltration (reduced total run-off). The time to ponding was significantly greater than control for all inoculated plots, suggesting that induced biocrusts may be most effective at improving infiltration under low-intensity, smaller precipitation events. Notably, the biocrusts in this study lacked rough surface microtopography, which is common in well-developed biocrusts regionally and likely instrumental in slowing overland flow and increasing infiltration for larger rain events. These results highlight the temporal lag that may exist between apparent and functional restoration of biocrusts. In addition, the simultaneous additions of stabilizing amendments with biocrust inoculum may work collectively to achieve both short- and long-term restoration targets.

These changes are expected to be influenced by the interplay of climate variability and human activities. Quantitatively evaluating these effects is crucial for framing climate variability adaptation measures and the assessment and management of regional water resources. Materials and methods Based on the annual rainfall, runoff, and sediment load data taken over the period from 1974 to 2013 and using data from 112 flood events, this study investigates the runoff and sediment load variations at the annual scale and distinguishes the impacts of climate variability and human activities at the event scale. The Mann-Kendall test and Pettitt's test are employed to detect the trends and abrupt change points of the annual runoff and sediment load. Rainfall and land surface conditions play a dominant role in the runoff and sediment yield of flood events. However, vegetation recovery, which benefits from the Grain-for-Green project and the construction of check dams has greatly changed the land surface condition, resulting in a reduction in streamflow energy, hydrological connectivity, and flood peaks. Therefore, for two flood events with similar rainfall conditions but different runoff and sediment yield, the differences in the runoff and sediment load within paired events may be attributed to the changes in the land surface condition induced by human activities. Results and discussion The results showed that the annual runoff and sediment load has significantly decreasing trends (p < 0.05). The abrupt changing point was detected in 1996, dividing the runoff and sediment load series into a baseline period (1974-1995) and a changing period (1996-2013). At the flood event scale, the hysteresis analysis showed that the counter-clockwise and figure-eight loops are the main patterns for both of the periods. The relationships between the runoff depth (H) and sediment yield (SY) varied greatly in 2007-2013 compared with those during 1974-1989. Human activities accounted for an average of 47 and 81% for the changes in the runoff and sediment load, respectively, and the remainder was attributable to climate variability. Conclusions Human activities have a greater effect on the sediment load reduction in the Xichuan River catchment, while climate variability accounted for more of the runoff changes.

Segmentation of Sandplain Lupin Weeds from Morphologically Similar Narrow-Leafed Lupins in the Field	REMOTE SENSING												Narrow-leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) is an important dryland crop, providing a protein source in global grain markets. While agronomic practices have successfully controlled many dicot weeds among narrow-leafed lupins, the closely related sandplain lupin (Lupinus cosentinii) has proven difficult to control, reducing yield and harvest quality. Here, we successfully trained a segmentation model to detect sandplain lupins and differentiate them from narrow-leafed lupins under field conditions. The deep learning model was trained using 9171 images collected from a field site in the Western Australian grain belt. Images were collected using an unoccupied aerial vehicle at heights of 4, 10, and 20 m. The dataset was supplemented with images sourced from the WeedAI database, which were collected at 1.5 m. The resultant model had an average precision of 0.86, intersection over union of 0.60, and F1 score of 0.70 for segmenting the narrow-leafed and sandplain lupins across the multiple datasets. Images collected at a closer range and showing plants at an early developmental stage had significantly higher precision and recall scores (p-value < 0.05), indicating image collection methods and plant developmental stages play a substantial role in the model performance.

Plant sensitivity to drier periods and drought events will largely depend on trait strategies to access and store water, often linked to the root system. However, understanding the role of below-ground traits in enhancing ecological resilience to these climate changes remains poorly understood. We present the results of a study in southern Africa where we analysed the relationship between root depth and the vegetation sensitivity index (VSI) (after Seddon and Macias-Fauria et al 2016 Nature 531 229-32). VSI demonstrates remotely-sensed aboveground vegetation responses to climate variability; thus our study compares aboveground vegetation responses to belowground root traits. Results showed a significant negative relationship between root depth and vegetation sensitivity. Deeper roots provided greater resistance to climate variability as shown by lower sensitivity and higher temporal autocorrelation in vegetation greenness (as measured by the enhanced vegetation index). Additionally, we demonstrated a link between deeper roots and depth to groundwater, further suggesting that it is the ability of deeper roots to enable access to groundwater that provides ecological resistance to climate variability. Our results therefore provide important empirical evidence that the ability to access deeper water resources during times of lower water availability through deeper roots, is a key trait for dryland vegetation in the face of future climate change. We also show that belowground traits in drylands leave a fingerprint on aboveground, remotely-sensed plant-climate interactions, an important finding to aid in scaling up data-scarce belowground research.

We evaluated net global warming potential (NGWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) in the organic farming system (OFS) using sheep grazing to control weeds without N application and the conventional farming system (CFS) with herbicide, pesticide, and N applications in three crop phases of a 5-yr crop rotation from 2013-2014 to 2015-2016 in the northern Great Plains. Crop phases were winter wheat after lentil (Lens culinaris L.) (W-L), winter wheat after sweet clover (Melilotus officinalis L.) cover crop (W-C), and lentil after winter wheat (L-W) in a 5-yr rotation of safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) and sweet clover cover crop intercrop-sweet clover cover crop-winter wheat-lentil-winter wheat. Carbon sequestration rate at the 0-to-120-cm depth from 2009 to 2015 was greater in OFS with W-C than other treatments. The CO2 equivalent of N2O + CH4 fluxes was greater in OFS with L-Wthan other treatments, except in CFS with L-W in 2014-2015 and 2015-2016. The CO2 equivalent of N fertilization was greater in CFS, but CO2 equivalent of CH4 flux due to enteric fermentation from sheep was greater in OFS. Both NGWP and GHGI were lower in OFS with W-C than other treatments. Organic farming system using sheep grazing to manage weeds in winter wheat following cover crop can reduce NGWP and GHGI compared with CFS with chemical inputs in dryland farming.

Intense genetic differentiation of seed dormancy among <i>Stipa lagascae</i> (Poaceae) genotypes accessed and multiplied in arid Tunisia	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Many ecological restoration projects involving wild dryland grasses work with bulk-harvested seed, yet bulking may lead one to overlook and lose genetic variation that turns out to be crucial for restoration success, including specific dormancy breakdown requirements (conditional dormancy) and genetic variation in these. This article reports on the genetic variation of conditional seed dormancy of Stipa lagascae Roem. & Schult. (Poaceae), a winter-growing bunch grass with high-grazing value, native to the circum-Mediterranean areas but threatened with extinction. This grass is a cleistogamous inbreeder whose population remnants exhibit a fine-grained genetic structure in many ecological traits. Seed from different lineages was obtained at the end of a seed increase program that chose not to bulk seed during seed sourcing, seed increase, nor seed harvesting for final use. Over a period of 3 years, three germination trials were run with seed coming from 15 to 20 different seed lineages and harvested over different years in two related seed increase plots. Seed lineage was the single most important factor explaining differences in conditional dormancy. Seed weight did not add much to explain these differences. The singularity of behavior of each lineage was conserved over the different harvests. Young seed exhibits the strongest differentiation in conditional dormancy. To restore genetically diversified populations of this inbreeding grass, restoration practitioners should avoid to bulk seed during sourcing and seed increase, because unique seed lineages get easily lost unseen. However, seed for final use could be bulk harvested if seed is used when still conditionally dormant.

Spatial nonstationarity affects the relationship between urban expansion and ecosystem service value (ESV) loss, but its significance has been under-emphasized. To study the spatially-heterogeneous ESV loss, we integrated cellular automata (CA) with geographically weighted regression (GWR) in a model that considers the relationships between urban expansion and its driving factors. We used ten GWR bandwidths to construct the CA(GWR) models for reproducing rapid urban expansion at Chongqing from 2005 to 2010. We then used the CA(GWR) model with the best bandwidth to predict future urban scenarios out to 2030. Our modeling shows that CA(GWR) is strongly sensitive to bandwidth, and that the overall accuracy and Figure-of-Merit are maximized with a similar to 2 km(2) bandwidth (about 150 samples). We examined ESV losses in eleven ecosystem classes and found that climate regulation and water flow regulation are the dominant drivers of ESV loss. From 2010 to 2030, Chongqing's urban area will increase by about 87%, resulting in substantial encroachment on agricultural land, dryland and shrubs, causing significant ESV losses of about 38%. Our results constitute an early warning of ecosystem degradation caused by massive urban development. This study improves our understanding of spatially-varying urban expansion and related ESV losses in rapidly developing areas and should help improve urban planning regulation and regional policy for sustainable development to maintain environmentally-friendly cities.

Ryan; Kallenbach, Robert L.; Yuan, Zhiyou			Predicted increased P relative to N growth limitation of dry grasslands under soil acidification and alkalinization is ameliorated by increased precipitation	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Global change potentially affects soil pH and thereby ecological stoichiometry. However, it remains unclear how changes in soil pH affect the total nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stoichiometry of soils and vegetations, which are of critical importance in understanding ecosystem nutrient cycling. Based on a two-year study for the effects of soil acid and alkali additions on soil and vegetational N:P stoichiometry at nine sites representing three grassland types (i.e., desert, typical and meadow grasslands with increasing precipitation availability), we found that across all grasslands, soil acidification did not affect soil [N], [P] or their stoichiometry, while soil alkali-zation reduced soil [N] and thus N:P ratio. In desert and typical grasslands, soil acidification showed no effects on vegetation [N], but reduced vegetation [P], resulting in increased vegetation N:P ratios. In meadow grasslands, soil acidification increased both vegetation [N] and [P], leading to little effect on vegetation N:P ratios. Soil alkalization increased vegetation [N] in desert and typical grasslands while reduced vegetation [P] in desert grasslands. Soil alkalization increased vegetation N:P ratios in desert and typical grasslands. However, vegetation N:P ratios in meadow grasslands were not affected by soil alkalization. Under soil acidification, precipitation was positively correlated with vegetation [P] and negatively correlated with the vegetation N:P ratios. Standardized major axis regression showed that both soil acidification and alkalization induced faster accumulation of vegetation P than N. Pearson correlation and structural equation modeling revealed that soil and vegetation [P] were responsible for spatial differences in vegetation N:P stoichiometry under altered soil pH. These results indicate that precipitation modulates vegetation N:P stoichiometry under and possibly via soil pH changes in temperate grasslands. Dryer grasslands showed greater alterations of vegetation N:P ratios after soil pH changed than wetter grasslands. We thus conclude that unproductive and dry grasslands may be sensitive to altered soil pH. This study reveals that precipitation and soil water were critical to predict grassland geochemical cycle in response to altered soil acidity/alkalinity.

J	Möckel, SC; Erlendsson, E; Gísladóttir, G				Mockel, Susanne Claudia; Erlendsson, Egill; Gisladottir, Guorun			Effect of mineral soil constituents on carbon characteristics of peatlands in aeolian environments of Iceland	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The effects of just over a millennium of heavy erosion of dryland soils (Andosols) are ubiquitous in the Icelandic landscape. While lushly vegetated peatlands may appear like pristine oases of resilience in an otherwise degraded landscape, they are impacted by the surrounding soil erosion. Iceland has one of the most active aeolian environments in the world, and emerging evidence suggests that the carbon dynamics of peatlands may be influenced by windborne volcanic deposits. In this study, the impact of increased dust deposition after the settlement of Iceland in c. 870 CE on the mineral pedogenic environment and its interaction with carbon characteristics of Histosols is investigated. This research uses surface soils (0-30 cm) of Histosols from three peatlands, which receive varying amounts of mineral deposition. We analyse datasets of the peatland vegetation characteristics, their carbon structure as derived by 13C NMR spectroscopy, andic soil properties based on selective extractions of Al, Fe, and Si, and other complementary soil properties. While differences in vegetation characteristics are to some extent reflected by differences in carbon characteristics, the mineral pedogenic environment also seems to play a role here. We find a stronger relation between andic soil properties and carbon characteristics than previously observed in subsoil Histosols. Decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) in Histosols which are influenced by andic properties seems to be relatively slow, with carbon characteristics dominated by labile carbon compounds, opposed to more rapid degradation of SOM and comparatively great accumulation of recalcitrant carbon compounds in Histosols without notable andic properties.																			0923-4861	1572-9834				DEC	2023	31	6					853	874		10.1007/s11273-023-09956-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-023-09956-x		SEP 2023											WOS:001074762900001

However, in many dryland environments, root systems face both water and nutrient scarcity (e.g. phosphorus (P)), with both resources often heterogeneously distributed in space and time. Under these conditions, interactions among RSA, nutrient distribution and soil water will determine crop performance, but remain poorly understood.MethodsWe grew two sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) genotypes defined by contrasting RSA (narrow or wide nodal root angle) in prepared soil cores with heterogeneous distributions of P and water along the soil profile. Plant growth and water use, shoot biomass, P uptake and root distribution were quantified in response to the different water x P combinations.ResultsSoil P placement and soil water distribution interactively determined plant growth and development in a genotype-dependent manner. The two sorghum genotypes shared common responses to P and water availability though varied for root and shoot traits and their relative responses to combined P and water stress.ConclusionsPlant responses to the different water x P combinations were illustrative of the occurrence of spatio-temporal trade-offs between root architecture and efficient soil resource capture. The results suggest that the relative ability of crop root systems to effectively exploit soil profiles with greater resource availability will not necessarily be important for crop productivity in heterogeneous soil systems. Local environmental constraints should be considered when deploying genotypes with selected root architectural traits.

Regenerative practices are vital to achieve joint goals of boosting yields and mitigating GHGs emissions. Nevertheless, studies usually consider crop yields and soil properties, often lacking quantitative analysis of GHGs. This meta-analysis used log response ratio (lnRR) to perform effect size statistics; assessing impacts of major regenerative (manure, biochar, and two integrated applications) and inorganic fertilizers on GHGs emissions. The results reveal that GHGs emissions were increased by fertilizer or manure addition, but biochar decreased GHGs emissions, with greatest benefit at 50 t ha-1. Combining biochar or manure application with fertilizer emitted CO2 and/or N2O. Applying biochar alone led to 144% reduction in global warming potential (GWP). Paddy-rice with fertilizer emitted N2O and CH4, whereas these were mitigated by wheat with biochar. Fine-textured soils with manure emitted all three GHGs, whereas biochar with coarse-textured soils reduced emissions. Medium-textured soils had reduced N2O (18%) and CH4 (25%) emissions with integrated biochar and fertilizer. CO2 and N2O emissions were highest for neutral and acidic soils with fertilizer but lowest for alkaline soils after biochar application. Soil C:N ratios affected the best strategy to minimize GHGs: for high C:N ratio, fertilizer or manure should be avoided, in favour of biochar. Yet integrated biochar and fertilizer should be avoided for soils with low C:N ratio. We conclude that regenerative strategies using manure risk converting global drylands into major GHGs emitters. However, strategies incorporating biochar could mitigate dryland GHGs emissions and minimize GWP.					; Ranjitkar, Sailesh/I-9307-2014	Iqbal, Shahid/0000-0003-3217-6388; Ranjitkar, Sailesh/0000-0002-4741-3975													0959-6526	1879-1786				APR 20	2023	398								136650	10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.136650	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.136650		MAR 2023											WOS:000965888100001

Ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE) is an important indicator reflecting the interaction between carbon and water, and investigating its spatial responses to hydrothermal and vegetative gradients is vital to understand the underlying mechanism of carbon-water coupling. The source region of the Yellow River (SRYR) is a typical alpine grassland ecosystem in drylands characterized by cold and arid climate, which is ecologically fragile and sensitive to environmental factors. In this study, we investigated the spatial variations of ecosystem WUE in the SRYR during 2000-2014 and examined its underlying drivers. The mean annual WUE showed significantly increasing trends along hydrothermal and vegetative gradients from semi-arid zone (SA) to dry sub-humid zone (DSH), with the average value of 0.59 +/- 0.35 gC kg-1 H2O. The spatial variations of WUE were mainly controlled by gross primary productivity (GPP) rather than evapotranspiration (ET). Compared to precipitation (P), temperature (Ta) better explained the spatial variations of WUE. And a temperature threshold of 0 degrees C was found, which indicated a shift of sensitivity of WUE to thermal conditions from permafrost to seasonally frozen ground due to the effects of low temperature on photosynthetic process in alpine grassland ecosystem. The responses of WUE to LAI gradients reflected the indirect effects of hydrothermal conditions on WUE by altering LAI. This study improves our understanding of the spatial responses of the regional carbon and water interactions to environmental conditions.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				AUG	2022	141								109064	10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109064	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109064													WOS:000818665800007

Mepiquat chloride (MC) application limits plant height, improves fruit retention and hastens maturity in responsive cultivars. Thus, the objective of this study was to address the effects of cultivar, irrigation, and MC strategy on cotton growth, maturity, yield, and fiber quality. Therefore, a field study was carried out using three cultivars, three different irrigation treatments, and three different MC treatments during the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons. In both years there was an interaction between irrigation and MC management for plant height. In 2020, MC treatments hastened cutout by two to three weeks in irrigated plots but did not affect cutout date in dryland plots. 2020 and 2021 differed substantially in rainfall (347 mm and 735 mm, respectively from planting to harvest). 2020 was a dry year in which yield responded positively to irrigation and 2021 was a wet year in which yield responded negatively to irrigation. There was no effect of MC treatments or interaction between MC and any other effect on lint yield. Fiber length was reduced, whereas strength and micronaire were increased by drought stress in 2020. Increased fiber length, strength, uniformity, and micronaire were observed by MC application in both years. Therefore, we can conclude that aggressive MC management reduces vegetative growth, promotes earlier physiological maturity under wel-lwatered conditions, and affects fiber quality, but does not necessarily interact with irrigation management to affect lint yield.

This is called the Kalman filter based method for fusing laser receiver and accelerometer (KFLA). By using the linear motion transducer as a comparative metric, laboratory experiments of accuracy evaluation were conducted within the motion range of-77 to +77 and-11 to +11 mm, respectively. The maximum absolute errors of the displacement estimated by the KFLA were 14.6 mm and 5.7 mm, respectively; and the root mean square errors were 5.6 mm and 1.9 mm, respectively. Meanwhile, the velocity estimated by the KFLA showed similar but smoother variations than the displacement difference. Vertical height estimation result of the implement of a field-travelling levelling machine showed that the KFLA curve passed through the bars represented by the rough height and corresponding deviation with a higher frequency of 50 Hz. Above all, the KFLA could calculate the height of the implement when the motion was beyond the sensing range of the receiver, which showed the stable acquisition of sensing signal enables KFLA to be competent for measurement tasks operating in complex terrain. Overall, the KFLA is a promising method to estimate the kinematic states of the implements in indoor/outdoor environments, dryland, and paddy fields. (c) 2021 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we hydroponically cultivated Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris L. ssp. cicla) under different flow rates to analyze changes in the growth, nutrient uptake, and nutrient use efficiency. When the flow rate was intensified from 2 to 4 L/min, leaf area, the fresh weight, dry weight, and root length increased. However, when the flow rate was increased from 4 to 8 L/min, values of these growth parameters decreased. The nutrient uptake had a similar trend relative to the growth parameters and nutrient use efficiency of macronutrient elements, increased as the flow rate increased. This indicates that the flow rate affects plant growth by influencing the nutrient uptake, and an increase in the flow rate can aid in improving nutrient use efficiency. In hydroponics, regulating the flow rate at a reasonable volume is recommended to increase yield by enhancing nutrient use efficiency, but too intensive a flow rate may cause excessive physical stimulation to plants and inhibit their growth. Therefore, it is important to choose an appropriate substrate flow rate for optimal hydroponics production.</p>					Tagawa, Kotaro/C-7639-2019	BAIYIN, BATEER/0000-0002-3542-7229; tagawa, kotaro/0000-0003-1768-0105														2073-4395				OCT	2021	11	10							2050	10.3390/agronomy11102050	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11102050													WOS:000716954600001
J	Currier, CM; Sala, OE				Currier, Courtney M.; Sala, Osvaldo E.			Precipitation versus temperature as phenology controls in drylands	ECOLOGY												Cycles of plant growth, termed phenology, are tightly linked to environmental controls. The length of time spent growing, bounded by the start and end of season, is an important determinant of the global carbon, water, and energy balance. Much focus has been given to global warming and consequences for shifts in growing-season length in temperate regions. In conjunction with warming temperatures, altered precipitation regimes are another facet of climate change that have potentially larger consequences than temperature in dryland phenology globally. We experimentally manipulated incoming precipitation in a semiarid grassland for over a decade and recorded plant phenology at the daily scale for 7 years. We found precipitation to have a strong relationship with the timing of grass greenup and senescence but temperature had only a modest effect size on grass greenup. Pre-season drought strongly resulted in delayed grass greenup dates and shorter growing-season lengths. Spring and summer drought corresponded with earlier grass senescence, whereas higher precipitation accumulation over these seasons corresponded with delayed grass senescence. However, extremely wet conditions diluted this effect and caused a plateaued response. Deep-rooted woody shrubs showed few effects of variable precipitation or temperature on phenology and displayed consistent annual phenological timing compared with grasses. Whereas rising temperatures have already elicited phenological consequences and extended growing-season length for mid and high-latitude ecosystems, precipitation change will be the major driver of phenological change in drylands that cover 40% of the land surface with consequences for the global carbon, water, and energy balance.

Partly as a result, relatively little C and GHG research has been conducted in resource-constrained developing countries. At the same time, these are often the same countries and regions in which climate change impacts will likely be strongest and in which major science uncertainties are centered, given the importance of dryland and tropical systems to the global C cycle. Increasingly, scientific communities have adopted appropriate technology and approach (AT&A) for C and GHG research, which focuses on low-cost and low-technology instruments, open-source software and data, and participatory and networking-based research approaches. Adopting AT&A can mean acquiring data with fewer technical constraints and lower economic burden and is thus a strategy for enhancing C and GHG research in developing countries. However, AT&A can have higher uncertainties; these can often be mitigated by carefully designing experiments, providing clear protocols for data collection, and monitoring and validating the quality of obtained data. For implementing this approach in developing countries, it is first necessary to recognize the scientific and moral importance of AT&A. At the same time, new AT&A techniques should be identified and further developed. All these processes should be promoted in collaboration with local researchers and through training local staff and encouraged for wide use and further innovation in developing countries.

A field study was conducted to investigate different long-term cropping systems on soil organic matter and microbial communities. The cropping systems studied were: (i) a 14-year continuous alfalfa (Medicago sativaL.) (CA), (ii) a 9-year alfalfa removed and rotated with 4-5 years continuous annual crops (spring wheat (Triticum aestivumL.), maize (Zea maysL.), potato (Solanum tuberosumL.), and millet (Panicum miliaceumL.)), and (iii) a 5-year field fallow after alfalfa. Results showed that continued annual crops decreased total organic C and labile organic C by 10 to 20% and 17 to 34% in the topsoil (0-30 cm), and by 15 to 35% and 20 to 46% in the subsoil (30-60 cm), respectively, compared with CA. Similar trends were found in soil total N concentration, which decreased by 7 to 20% in the topsoil. Highest microbial biomass C was found in CA. Shannon-Wiener diversity and substrate richness of soil microbes measured by Biolog EcoPlates was significantly affected by cropping system with CA exhibiting a higher degree of soil microbial functional diversity in the topsoil, while the lowest values were found in the alfalfa-potato system. The higher soil organic matter content and functional diversity of soil microbe in CA indicates that soil nutrition and microbial activity did not limit alfalfa development and growth in the dryland area. The lower microbial activity and functional diversity observed in the potato field indicates the importance of crop selection in cropping systems.

These processes are known to impact the spatial patterns of soil, nutrients, plant-available water, and vegetation in many dryland ecosystems. Tracers, such as rare earth elements and stable isotopes have been successfully used to quantify the transport and redistribution of sediment by aeolian processes in these ecosystems. However, many of the existing tracer techniques are labor-intensive and cost-prohibitive, and hence simpler alternative approaches are needed to track aeolian redistribution of sediments. To address this methodological gap, we test the applicability of a novel metal tracer-based methodology for estimating post-fire aeolian sediment redistribution, using spatio-temporal measurements of low-field magnetic susceptibility (MS). We applied magnetic metal tracers on soil microsites beneath shrub vegetation in recently burned and in control treatments in a heterogeneous landscape in the Chihuahuan desert (New Mexico, USA). Our results indicate a spatially homogeneous distribution of the magnetic tracers on the landscape after post-burn wind erosion events. MS decreased after wind erosion events on the burned shrub microsites, indicating that these areas functioned as sediment sources following the wildfire, whereas they are known to be sediment sinks in the undisturbed (e.g. not recently burned) ecosystem. This experiment represents the first step toward the development of a cost-effective and non-destructive tracer-based approach to estimate the transport and redistribution of sediment by aeolian processes.

Since 1949, China has committed to soil and water conservation (SWC), for which eight regions and 41 subregions have been developed to improve the environment and increase land productivity. To obtain information from the regional planning and strategies for SWC and to explore whether SWC practices simultaneously contribute to soil conservation, ecosystem functioning, and the livelihoods of local farmers, and to summarize the successful experiences of various SWC paradigms with distinct characteristics and mechanisms of soil erosion, this paper systematically presents seven SWC regions (excluding the Tibetan Plateau region) and 14 typical SWC paradigms, focusing on erosion mechanisms and the key challenges or issues in the seven regions as well as on the core problems, main objectives, key technologies, and the performance of the 14 typical paradigms. In summary, the 14 typical SWC paradigms successfully prevent and control local soil erosion, and have largely enhanced, or at least do not harm, the livelihoods of local farmers. However, there remain many challenges and issues on SWC and socioeconomic development that need to be addressed in the seven SWC regions. China, thus, still has a long way to go in successfully gaining the win-win objective of SWC and human aspects of development.					dang, xiaohu/HKE-4418-2023														1002-0063	1993-064X				AUG	2020	30	4					643	664		10.1007/s11769-020-1139-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-020-1139-7													WOS:000548683100007

The aim of this study was to quantify the coffee outturn index of the Amazon Robusta cultivars grown in irrigated and dryland Western Amazon environments. According to the maturation cycle of each clone, washed samples of cherry coffee were collected considering a completely randomized factorial design for characterization of the effects of genotypes, environments, and the genotype x environment (GxE) interaction. The contrasting environments of Porto Velho, RO, and Ouro Preto do Oeste, RO, Brazil, represent most of the coffee growing sites located in Am and Aw climate types, cultivated in Red and Yellow Oxisols, typical of the Western Amazon. The weight reductions through drying exhibited a GxE interaction of the complex type, which is characterized by a change in the ordering of genotypes from one environment to another, whereas the weight reductions through hulling exhibited a GxE interaction predominantly of the simple type. The reduction in weight due to drying was more affected by the environment than reduction in weight after pulping. The clones BRS1216, BRS 3220, and BRS3137 had the highest outturn index estimates and the clones BRS2314, BRS3213, and BRS2336 had the lowest outturn index estimates. The clones BRS2299, BRS3210, BRS3193, and BRS2357 had performance near the mean value of this group of genotypes. Considered together, the genotypes had a mean outturn of 24.41%, with an amplitude from 22.5% to 27.2%.

Three different cultivation practices (conventional cultivation, plastic film mulching and straw retention) and N rates (0, 144 and 180 kg N ha(-1)) were assigned as the main plots and split plots separately in a split-plot design during 2017-2020. Moreover N-15-labeled urea was used in each microplot to trace the fertilizer N fate. The results showed that the N recovery efficiencies with plastic film mulching, straw retention and conventional cultivation were 44-46%, 34-37% and 43-44% in the first season. However, it sharply decreased in the next two seasons. The N residual rates in straw retention and plastic film mulching were 21-26% and 20-27% after three wheat seasons, which were higher than that in conventional cultivation. Furthermore, residual nitrate nitrogen was detected in the deep profiles in plastic film mulching and straw retention at the third season. The ammonia volatilization sourced from fertilizer was 3-5 kg ha(-1) in the first season and accounted for 2-3% of the total applied N. Overall, plastic film mulching treatment increased fertilizer N utilization by plants and residual fertilizer N in soil, and reduced unidentified fertilizer N. Although, straw retention depressed fertilizer N uptake by plants, it improved the N budget and had the potential to reduce N input. Accordingly, plastic film mulching and straw retention are recommended in dryland wheat cropping systems. However, we should pay attention to the residual plastic pollution in the practice.																			1385-1314	1573-0867				MAR	2023	125	2			SI		123	136		10.1007/s10705-022-10217-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-022-10217-1		JUL 2022											WOS:000829629400002

However, it is challenging to grow cyanobacteria in dry, saline soils, which limits the application of this technology. In this study, NaCl was added into field-collected induced biocrusts to investigate how salt affects the biocrust community. This fundamental knowledge improves our assessment of microbial salinity preference and adaptation, and can guide researchers to select the appropriate cyanobacterial inoculants for saline soil restoration. The results showed that the biocrusts induced by inoculating Microcoleus vaginatus and Scytonema javanicum could survive 1.0% salinity, although both salt and drought stresses significantly inhibited microbial biomass and metabolism (P < 0.05), and salinity led to an obvious shift in microbial community structure. Compared to salt stress, drought seems to provide a vital ecological protection for the biocrusts, allowing them to be active only under relative low salinity after hydration. In the induced biocrusts, cyanobacteria were always the dominant organisms (even 18 years since inoculation), whereas under elevated salinity, cyanobacterial communities with lower relative abundance had a higher survival percentage of M. steenstrupii and Phormidium sp. Altogether, our results showed that both prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities have obvious salinity preference in the cyanobacteria-induced biocrusts. These results suggest that cyanobacterial inoculation strategies can be adapted in response to the soil salinity conditions. Furthermore, a combined inoculation of M. steenstrupii and Phormidium sp. appears to be favorable approach that is expected to improve cyanobacterial inoculation technology in saline soils.

J	Sacande, M; Muir, G				Sacande, Moctar; Muir, Giulia			Restoring Sahelian landscapes with people and plants: insights from large-scale interventions	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Combining traditional knowledge on native plant species with scientific plant expertise has been established as a critical factor to improve success of restoration interventions, yet evidence on its incorporation across large scales and in Africa, is scant. Even less known are the effective socio-economic benefits that communities have reaped from restoration activities. This article builds on Sacande and Berrahmouni's paper, further supported by both socio-economic and biophysical data from large-scale restoration activities in Senegal, Niger, and Nigeria in support of Africa's Great Green Wall. In total, over 90,000 village households were involved and 56,000 ha of degraded lands planted in 10 countries across the Sahel to initiate restoration in 5 years. Key findings suggest not only ecological benefits, but improvements in livelihoods and health, critical factors underpinning restoration success in the drylands. Results show the profound role native plants and other non-timber forest products play in the lives and livelihoods of dryland communities. Between 2016 and 2020, 120 tons of seeds were collected from over 110 native plant species and planted in 10 countries, with ecological and economic benefits. Perceived food insecurity significantly decreased in 2020 compared to 2016 observations, declining sharply from 46 to 15% in project sites in Senegal, from 69 to 58% in Niger, and 90 to 25% in Nigeria. In Niger and Senegal, communities generated revenues from fodder species alone of 40 USD/ha per year. The UN decade for Ecosystem restoration 2021-2030 will be an important platform to expand such climate change adaptation and mitigation programs.																			1061-2971	1526-100X				NOV	2022	30	8							e13656	10.1111/rec.13656	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.13656		MAR 2022											WOS:000765887700001

Across climate treatments, we encountered 109 AMF operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were assigned to four families: Glomeraceae (93.94%), Gigasporaceae (2.19%), Claroideoglomeraceae (1.95%), and Diversisporaceae (1.92%). AMF community composition and diversity at OTU level were unaffected by the climate manipulation treatments, except for a significant decrease in AMF OTU richness in the W treatment relative to the control. However, we found a significant decrease of AMF family richness in all climate manipulation treatments relative to the control treatment. Members of the Gigasporaceae and Diversisporaceae families appeared to be highly vulnerable to intensification of heat and drought stress, as their abundances decreased by 67% and 77%, respectively, in the W + RR treatment relative to current ambient conditions. In contrast, the relative abundance and dominance of the Glomeraceae family within the AMF community increased significantly under the W + RR treatment, with Glomeraceae being the indicator family for the W + RR treatment. The interaction between warming and rainfall reduction had a significant effect on AMF community structure at family level. These findings provide new insights to help in the conservation of the soil biodiversity facing climate change in dryland ecosystems.					van der Heijden, Marcel/AAY-1593-2021; Schlaeppi, Klaus/HCI-8011-2022; García, Álvaro López/J-9190-2014; Querejeta, Jose I/B-6297-2008; Alguacil, Maria del Mar/M-3859-2014	Schlaeppi, Klaus/0000-0003-3620-0875; García, Álvaro López/0000-0001-8267-3572; Querejeta, Jose I/0000-0002-9547-0974; van der Heijden, Marcel/0000-0001-7040-1924; Alguacil, Maria del Mar/0000-0001-8495-8707													0095-3628	1432-184X				OCT	2022	84	3					941	944		10.1007/s00248-021-01886-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-021-01886-6		OCT 2021						34608508					WOS:000704177800001

Predictive mapping of soil copper for site-specific micronutrient management using GIS-based sequential Gaussian simulation	MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT												Given that soil properties including micronutrient contents vary in space and time, geospatial mapping is necessary for robust site-specific management planning. Kriging interpolation is often used in GIS environments for mapping, but it has inherent limitation of having a smooth effects. In this study, sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS) was used to map the spatial distribution of Cu concentration in and model the spatial uncertainties for an arable dryland in central Botswana. The field was divided into 30 parallel lines in an NE-SW orientation. Soil samples were collected at intervals of 25 m on each line; and 35 sampling points were obtained. A total of 1050 soils sampled at a depth of about 20 cm were air dried and analyzed using an Olympus Delta Sigma(R) portable X-ray fluorescence analyser. The average concentration of Cu (146 mg kg(-1)) in the Maibele Airstrip of Botswana is higher than the global average copper concentration (30 mg kg(-1)). Low copper contents were found dotted around the northern and southern edges of the study area, while high content zone is found in the interior. In comparison to kriging interpolation, SGS technique shows better performance. Kriging generally overestimated where lower values are probable and underestimated where higher values are probable. A large portion of the area has Cu content above the critical threshold of 125 mg kg(-1). Since total and not plant available Cu were the measured parameter, we recommend that further study in this location should focus on confirming the plant available Cu in the high-risk areas.

To investigate the influence of varying climate and streamflow regimes on rates of decomposition and associated nutrient dynamics, we used a space-for-time substitution design in which we deployed a common leaf litter across a range of ephemeral to seasonally- intermittent stream reaches (10) and landscape positions (channel, riparian, upland) in Arizona, USA over an 18-month period. We also measured soil physio-chemical properties and nutrient dynamics associated with these reaches and positions. Consistent with expectations, rates of litter decomposition (k) decreased significantly in the channels as cumulative percentage (%) of water presence decreased below 40%. Indeed, differences in cumulative duration of water presence as well as channel bed material silt content explained 80% of the variation in k across flow regimes. In contrast, decay rates of the common litter across sites were surprisingly similar in upland and riparian positions despite large differences in climate, specifically precipitation (160-516 mm). Relatively similar litter nitrogen immobilization and soil moisture in upland and riparian environments helped to explain the lack of difference in k and soil nutrient dynamics in these environments. Collectively, our findings indicate that stream water presence may be a more important indicator of ephemeral and intermittent stream function than streamflow alone and that riparian zones in these dryland regions may be less responsive to changes in climate and associated subsidies of streamflow.																				2624-9375				OCT 28	2020	2								571044	10.3389/frwa.2020.571044	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2020.571044													WOS:000659431700001

Soil spatial variability can be predicted from legacy soil data through machine learning techniques producing quantitative soil maps requiring minimal resources. South Africa has a country wide 1:250,000 scale resource map known as the Land Type Survey (LTS) which includes soil properties such as soil depth, soil class, root limiting layer, clay content, and texture. Each LTS polygon (land type), is comprised of unique soil - terrain patterns and is therefore, not a true soil map. This study aims to disaggregate the LTS into a farm-scale soil depth class map through a two-step disaggregation approach. First, landform elements were predicted through a pattern recognition algorithm known as geomorphons. Geomorphons, together with the original LTS were overlaid to produce polygons with unique distributions of soil. The polygons were disaggregated further to produce a raster map of soil depth classes through a soil map disaggregation algorithm known as DSMART. The first most probable class raster achieved an accuracy of 68% and for the two most probable class rasters, an accuracy of 91% was achieved. The two-step approach proved necessary for producing a farm-scale soil map. The result of this study is significant as it produced a soil depth class map from a national resource map at a scale and resolution (10 m) suitable for farm management.

Mesh bags, each containing 30 g of corn or bean straw, were buried at a soil depth of 20 cm in a 12-year-old peach orchard for 360 d (October 2011-October 2012). Three treatments were applied, i.e., fresh corn straw, fresh corn straw with nitrogen fertilizer (urea, 10.34 g/kg), and fresh bean straw. Changes in straw residual rate, straw water content and soil conditions were monitored after treatment. The functional diversity of straw-associated microbial communities was analyzed by the Biolog-Eco microplate assay. During the decomposition process, straw residual rates did not vary considerably from 10 d (30.4%-45.4%) to 360 d (19.0%-30.3%). Irrespective of nitrogen addition, corn straw decomposed faster than bean straw. Corn straw with nitrogen fertilizer yielded the highest average well color development (AWCD) values (1.11-1.67), followed by corn straw (1.14-1.68) and bean straw (1.18-1.62). Although the AWCD values did not differ significantly among the three treatments, substantial differences occurred across various time periods of the decomposition process (P<0.01). In terms of carbon source utilization, the dominant microbial groups fed mainly on saccharides. Hard-to-decompose substances gradually accumulated in the middle and late stages of straw decomposition. Of the six categories of carbon sources tested, the utilization rate of aromatics was the lowest with corn straw, whereas that of polymers was the lowest with bean straw. Among different treatments, straw residual rate was negatively correlated to soil available phosphorous, soil available potassium and soil temperature (P<0.05), but not to soil water content. In some cases (corn straw with or without nitrogen fertilizer), straw residual rate was negatively correlated to straw water content, amino acid utilization and carboxylic acid utilization, and positively correlated with microbial species richness and evenness (P<0.05). Microbial community associated with corn and bean straw decomposition in soil was respectively dominated by aromatic- and polymer-metabolizing groups during the middle and late stages of this process, which could reduce the stability of microbial community structure and decrease the rate of straw decomposition in fruit tree orchard.																			1674-6767	2194-7783				FEB	2021	13	2					152	164		10.1007/s40333-021-0001-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-021-0001-9		JAN 2021											WOS:000607763400001

Climate change should drive mammal defaunation in tropical dry forests	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Human-induced climate change has intensified negative impacts on socioeconomic factors, the environment, and biodiversity, including changes in rainfall patterns and an increase in global average temperatures. Drylands are particularly at risk, with projections suggesting they will become hotter, drier, and less suitable for a significant portion of their species, potentially leading to mammal defaunation. We use ecological niche modelling and community ecology biodiversity metrics to examine potential geographical range shifts of non-volant mammal species in the largest Neotropical dryland, the Caatinga, and evaluate impacts of climate change on mammal assemblages. According to projections, 85% of the mammal species will lose suitable habitats, with one quarter of species projected to completely lose suitable habitats by 2060. This will result in a decrease in species richness for more than 90% of assemblages and an increase in compositional similarity to nearby assemblages (i.e., reduction in spatial beta diversity) for 70% of the assemblages. Small-sized mammals will be the most impacted and lose most of their suitable habitats, especially in highlands. The scenario is even worse in the eastern half of Caatinga where habitat destruction already prevails, compounding the threats faced by species there. While species-specific responses can vary with respect to dispersal, behavior, and energy requirements, our findings indicate that climate change can drive mammal assemblages to biotic homogenization and species loss, with drastic changes in assemblage trophic structure. For successful long-term socioenvironmental policy and conservation planning, it is critical that findings from biodiversity forecasts are considered.

This study calculated Central Asian WUE for 2001-2021 based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and analyzed its spatial and temporal variability using temporal information entropy. The importance of atmospheric factors, hydrological factors, and biological factors in driving WUE in Central Asia was also explored using a geographic detector. The results show the following: (1) the average WUE in Central Asia from 2001-2021 is 2.584-3.607 gCkg(-1)H(2)O, with weak inter-annual variability and significant intra-annual variability and spatial distribution changes; (2) atmospheric and hydrological factors are strong drivers, with land surface temperature (LST) being the strongest driver of WUE, explaining 54.8% of variation; (3) the interaction of the driving factors can enhance the driving effect by more than 60% for the interaction between most atmospheric factors and vegetation factors, of which the effect of the interaction of temperature (TEM) with vegetation cover (FVC) is the greatest, explaining 68.1% of the change in WUE. Furthermore, the interaction of driving factors with very low explanatory power (e.g., water pressure (VAP), aerosol optical depth over land (AOD), and groundwater (GWS)) has a significant enhancement effect. Vegetation is an important link in driving WUE, and it is important to understand the mechanisms of WUE change to guide ecological restoration projects.

Effect of Irrigation with Treated Municipal Wastewater on<i> Vitis</i><i> vinifera</i> L.<i> cvs.</i> Cabernet Sauvignon and Sauvignon blanc in Commercial Vineyards in the Coastal Region of South Africa- Vegetative Growth, Yield and Juice Characteristics	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ENOLOGY AND VITICULTURE												A long-term trial was conducted in commercial vineyards in the Coastal region of South Africa to assess the impact of treated municipal wastewater irrigation on vineyards. Cabernet Sauvignon and Sauvignon blanc grapevines were irrigated using treated municipal wastewater from the Potsdam wastewater treatment works for 11 years. Grapevines were either rainfed (RF), irrigated with treated municipal wastewater via a single dripper line (SLD) or received twice the volume of wastewater via a double dripper line (DLD). Grapevine responses were measured from the 2013/14 to 2017/18 seasons. Although high amounts of K+, Na+ and Cl- were applied via wastewater irrigation, it did not result in excessive uptake by plants and did not affect vegetative growth or yield negatively. Irrigation reduced water constraints throughout the growing season compared to RF conditions, particularly for Cabernet Sauvignon. Consequently, SLD and DLD grapevines produced stronger vegetative growth and higher yields compared to RF. Results showed that the availability of irrigation water (albeit of relatively low quality) in regions where grapevines are usually grown under dryland conditions can increase grapevine productivity whilst maintaining good fruit quality. However, the water can vary in its availability as well as its quality over a short period of time. Plant and soil water status should be monitored regularly to avoid over-irrigation. Implementing low frequency irrigation scheduling with a sufficient leaching fraction will allow adequate time between irrigation applications for soils to aerate and organic material to decompose. Irrigation water, soils and grapevine leaves should be analysed to ensure that chemical parameters conform to recommended thresholds and norms.																			0253-939X	2224-7904					2023	44	2					126	143		10.21548/44-2-5871	http://dx.doi.org/10.21548/44-2-5871													WOS:001111311800003

Within Cactaceae, spatial diversity patterns are poorly explored, as are the abiotic factors that may predict these patterns. We gathered geographic and genetic data from 921 cactus species by exploring both the occurrence and genetic databases, which are tightly associated with drylands, to evaluate diversity patterns, such as phylogenetic diversity and endemism, paleo-, neo-, and superendemism, and the environmental predictor variables of such patterns in a global analysis. Hotspot areas of cacti diversity are scattered along the Neotropical and Nearctic regions, mainly in the desertic portion of Mesoamerica, Caribbean Island, and the dry diagonal of South America. The geomorphological features of these regions may create a complexity of areas that work as locally buffered zones over time, which triggers local events of diversification and speciation. Desert and dryland/dry forest areas comprise paleo- and superendemism and may act as both museums and cradles of species, displaying great importance for conservation. Past climates, topography, soil features, and solar irradiance seem to be the main predictors of distinct endemism types. The hotspot areas that encompass a major part of the endemism cells are outside or poorly covered by formal protection units. The current legally protected areas are not able to conserve the evolutionary diversity of cacti. Given the rapid anthropogenic disturbance, efforts must be reinforced to monitor biodiversity and the environment and to define/plan current and new protected areas.

Rotating perennial forages into annual wheat cropping systems: Correlations between plant available soil and grain mineral concentrations	AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES & ENVIRONMENT												Correlations between plant available soil and grain mineral concentrations are often assumed, yet few studies examine these associations. Here, soil and wheat grain samples were analyzed from a semi-arid dryland cropping study in the northern Great Plains conducted between 2006 and 2011. Continuous spring wheat (fertilized) (Triticum aestivum L; CSW) was compared with wheat following 5 yr of perennial forages of either alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), intermediate wheatgrass (fertilized) (Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkw. & D.R. Dewey sbsp. Intermedium; IWG), or an alfalfa/intermediate wheatgrass mixture (fertilized; MIX). Wheat performance (yield, 1,000 kernel weight [TKW], and crude protein [CP] concentration), and associations between 11 plant available soil mineral concentrations and 11 wheat grain mineral concentrations were assessed. Wheat following alfalfa had greater yield than all treatments, greater TKW than CSW, greater CP than IWG and CSW, but lower grain Zn concentration than IWG (p <= .05). Wheat grain following IWG had greater Fe and Mn concentration than MIX, greater Mg concentration than CSW, and lower S concentration than all treatments (p < .05). Multivariate correlation analysis showed positive correlations between plant available soil and grain B, Mg, Mn, and S concentrations (p <= .02), while plant available soil and grain Zn and Ca concentrations showed negative associations (p <= .05). Rotating perennial forage phases into wheat cropping systems increased wheat yield and CP but reduced certain plant available soil minerals. Although rotating perennials into annual cropping systems can benefit some soil quality parameters it may also diminish plant available soil minerals, influencing fertility recommendations.

Signatures of an abiotic decomposition pathway in temperate forest leaf litter	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Photodegradation helps explain why leaf litter mass loss rates are comparable between mesic environments and drylands, despite water availability limiting decomposer activity in drylands. With photodegradation, light energy directly mineralizes photoreactive organic molecules such as lignin, which contrasts with biotically-driven decomposition where lignin persists in decomposing leaf litter relative to other compounds. Photodegradation of leaf litter has largely been studied in dryland systems, but whether it occurs in mesic, deciduous forest systems is uncertain. As such, we examined potential photodegradation in maple and oak litter in the Southern Appalachian Mountains (USA) during the non-growing season, when newly fallen leaves are exposed to maximum solar radiation without deciduous canopies. The proportion of oxidized lignin in the leaf litter relative to other carbon compounds decreased with maximum solar radiation during the non-growing season. With a closed canopy, however, the proportion of total lignin relative to other compounds in the leaves increased. This pattern was particularly strong for the syringyl- S6 and guaiacyl-G6 lignin monomers. The relative proportion of S6 and G6 in the litters was reduced by 10-65% in the first 5 months. The largest reductions in lignin occurred on south-facing mountain slopes where solar radiation was highest (relative to north-facing slopes) in the Northern Hemisphere. Overall, however, the changes in lignin did not alter cumulative litter mass lost. Our results suggest that photodegradation promotes the transformation and relative loss of lignin in the early stages of litter decomposition in mesic deciduous forests.

Quantification of their hydrological processes is important to inform ecosystem understanding and future conservation efforts under a changing climate, and to provide guidance for restoration. By combining in situ hydrometric observations, hydrochemistry, remote sensing and a soil water balance model, we characterise the groundwater-surface water interactions in ephemeral low-order catchments of the granitoid regions of the southern Kruger National Park (KNP). Streams at the lowest orders are augmented by lateral interflows from the catena, although the second-and third-order stream reaches are conduits for groundwater recharge to the fractured rock aquifer; the soils of the crests and foot-slopes also show preferential flow, and are truly recharge soils, whilst the duplex soils of the midslopes clearly show their responsive nature to a low soil moisture deficit in the shallow horizons. Actual evaporation (aET) differed between catena elements with surprisingly little variation at third-order hillslopes, with the greatest overall aET at the first order. Meanwhile, soil water balances demonstrated a significant variation in storage of the riparian zones as a result of interflow from upslope and aET losses. Furthermore, data support broader-scale observations that groundwater recharge through the vadose zone to the fractured rock aquifer is dependent upon threshold antecedent precipitation conditions. Moderate precipitation events (5 mm/day - 35 mm/day) over a 2-3 week period initiate groundwater responses with a 2-3 month lag, whilst intense precipitation events (>100 mm/day) are expressed within 2-3 weeks.					van Tol, Johan J/L-5370-2013	van Tol, Johan/0000-0002-0222-8119; Fundisi, Daniel/0000-0001-7730-027X; Riddell, Eddie/0000-0002-3437-9536; Nel, Jaco/0000-0002-0494-3423; Jumbi, Faith/0000-0002-3341-132X													0075-6458	2071-0771				OCT 29	2020	62	2							a1583	10.4102/koedoe.v62i2.1583	http://dx.doi.org/10.4102/koedoe.v62i2.1583													WOS:000588720200001

In this study, ultraviolet-visible absorbance spectroscopy and excitation-emission matrices of fluorescence spectroscopy in combination with parallel factor analysis (EEMs-PARAFAC) were applied to characterize a total of 92 DOM samples extracted from four typical soil types under three different land-use regimes across China. DOC concentrations ranged from 6.52 +/- 1.09 to 25.62 +/- 4.83 mg L-1 and were generally higher in red soil from Guangdong and Guangxi, especially in paddy soil. Three fluorescence components were identified in soil DOM by EEMs-PARAFAC, including high molecular weight UVA humic-like substances (C1), low molecular weight autochthonous humic-like substances (C2), and protein-like substances (C3). DOM from black soil in Heilongjiang, purple soil from Sichuan, and red soil from Zhejiang had more humic-like substances, whereas DOM from yellow soil in Guizhou and red soil from Guangdong and Guangxi had lower degree of aromaticity and higher proportion of microbial-derived protein-like components (C3). Moreover, DOM from paddy soil tended to be more of protein-like components (C3) than that from other land uses and DOM from dryland soil generally had more autochthonous humic-like substances (C2). Our results demonstrated that soil DOM characteristics both varied significantly by soil type and land use, and EEMs-PARAFAC could be a useful approach to characterize the components and sources of heterogeneous DOM in soils.

From cattle to camels: trajectories of livelihood adaptation and social-ecological resilience in a Kenyan pastoralist community	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												In drylands across the globe, natural resource-dependent societies are experiencing rapid rates of environmental change as well as transforming social, economic, and political contexts. When novel adaptation strategies are adopted in response to changing climatic and environmental conditions, outcomes are often contingent on individual households' adaptive capacities as well as broader environmental, social, economic, and political contexts. Understanding the heterogeneous and context-dependent outcomes of adaptation strategies is critical information for dryland sustainability policy, and is a burgeoning focus in climate adaptation science. We evaluated the 30-year process of novel adoption of camel husbandry by a group of Kenyan pastoralists, using a five-stage analytical approach that disaggregated dynamics in three ways: at the level of each individual who adopted camel husbandry; at the processual level by distinguishing assets that influenced decision-making, enactment, and streams of livelihood benefits; and at the temporal level by assessing changes in broader social-ecological contexts that occurred over the 30-year period. Our study revealed that adaptation unfolded as a heterogeneous, multi-phase process, contingent on individuals' different sources of adaptive capacity utilized at different junctures in their adaptation experience, as well as on temporal shifts in the broader social-ecological context. Synthesizing the findings using a multi-dimensional vulnerability framework, we concluded that because of inequality in access to assets among households and a concomitant weakening of social norms of reciprocity and social cohesion, the livelihood adaptation is generating contradictory effects on household-level and community-level resilience.

J	Lin, SD; Deng, MJ; Wei, K; Wang, QJ; Su, LJ				Lin, Shudong; Deng, Mingjiang; Wei, Kai; Wang, Quanjiu; Su, Lijun			A new regional cotton growth model based on reference crop evapotranspiration for predicting growth processes	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Meteorological conditions and irrigation amounts are key factors that affect crop growth processes. Typically, crop growth and development are modeled as a function of time or growing degree days (GDD). Although the most important component of GDD is temperature, it can vary significantly year to year while also gradually shifting due to climate changes. However, cotton is highly sensitive to various meteorological factors, and reference crop evapotranspiration (ETO) integrates the primary meteorological factors responsible for global dryland extension and aridity changes. This paper constructs a cotton growth model using ETO, which improves the accuracy of crop growth simulation. Two cotton growth models based on the logistic model established using GDD or ETO as independent factors are evaluated in this paper. Additionally, this paper examines mathematical models that relate irrigation amount and irrigation water utilization efficiency (IWUE) to the maximum leaf area index (LAI(max)) and cotton yield, revealing some key findings. First, the model using cumulative reference crop evapotranspiration (CETO) as the independent variable is more accurate than the one using cumulative growing degree days. To better reflect the effects of meteorological conditions on cotton growth, this paper recommends using CETO as the independent variable to establish cotton growth models. Secondly, the maximum cotton yield is 7171.7 kg/ha when LAI(max) is 6.043 cm(2)/cm(2), the corresponding required irrigation amount is 518.793 mm, and IWUE is 21.153 kg/(ha & BULL;mm). Future studies should consider multiple associated meteorological factors and use ETO crop growth models to simulate and predict crop growth and yield.																			2045-2322					MAY 5	2023	13	1							7368	10.1038/s41598-023-34552-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-34552-7								37147371					WOS:001025168800001

Recovery of nitrogen fertiliser by drill-sown rice crops using best management practice: a <SUP>15</SUP>N-labelled urea study	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE												Context. Optimising nitrogen (N) management strategies for drill-sown rice crops is essential for minimising input costs for growers and reducing the environmental impact of rice production. Aims. The study aimed to determine the recovery of fertiliser-N in drill-sown Australian rice crops, following current N fertiliser recommendations where two-thirds of the N is applied at sowing (pre-flood) and one-third at panicle initiation. Methods. N-15-labelled urea was used to quantify N recovery by field-grown rice crops on a Sodosol and a Vertosol, and to determine the contributions of fertiliser-N applied pre-flood vs that applied at panicle initiation to total N fertiliser recovery on the Vertosol. Results. Recovery of N-15 fertiliser in grain + straw was similar to 50% of applied N on both soils, with a further 20% recovered from roots and soil to a depth of 30 cm. Recovery of N fertiliser applied at panicle initiation (59%) was significantly higher than of N fertiliser applied pre-flood (43%), likely due to the presence of actively growing roots and higher plant N demand. Crops that received N fertiliser took up more native soil N than unfertilised crops on the Vertosol; hence, apparent fertiliser N recoveries were 10-15% higher than N fertiliser recovery determined using N-15-labelled urea. Conclusions. The recovery of 50% of fertiliser-N in aboveground plant material indicates that N fertiliser use efficiency in drill-sown rice is similar to that of dryland cereal crops in Australia when best management practice guidelines for N fertiliser use are followed.

El Paso, Texas's ambient air has reached hazardous levels of PM10 from dust with near zero visibility due to these natural events originating in the surrounding Chihuahuan Desert. The aim of this study was to investigate whether dust exposures in El Paso (generally acute, short-term exposures from nearby source areas) are associated with significant increases in hospitalizations on the day of the exposure and up to seven days afterwards. Using a Poisson regression, it was found that the relative risks of hospitalizations due to a variety of conditions were associated with dust exposures (through increases of 100 mu g/m(3) maximum hourly PM10 and/or increases of 4.5 m/s maximum hourly wind speed) in El Paso County, Texas between 2010 and 2014.

Runoff and focused groundwater-recharge response to flooding rains in the arid zone of Australia	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												A groundwater recharge investigation in the arid zone of Australia is presented. The investigation used a wide range of hydrogeological techniques including geological mapping, surface and borehole geophysics, groundwater hydraulics, streambed temperature and pressure monitoring, and hydrogeochemical and environmental tracer sampling, and it was complemented by analysis of rainfall intensity from 18 tipping-bucked rain gauges, climate data and stream runoff measurements. Run-off and recharge from a 200-mm rainfall event in January 2015, the largest daily rainfall in the local 50-year record, were investigated in detail. While this major storm provided substantial run-off as a potential source for focused, indirect recharge, it only produced enough actual recharge to the shallow aquifer to temporarily halt a long-term groundwater recession. A series of smaller rainfall-runoff events in 2016 produced a similar recharge response. The results suggest that the total magnitude of a flood event is not the main control on indirect groundwater recharge at this location. A deeper aquifer shows no hydraulic response to surface-water flow events and is isolated from the shallow system, consistent with its Pleistocene groundwater age. This supports a growing body of evidence indicating that attributing or predicting generalised changes in recharge to changes in climate in dryland environments should not be attempted without first unravelling the dynamic processes governing groundwater recharge in the locality of interest. The results should prompt more detailed and long-term field investigation in other arid zone locations to further understand the episodic and nonlinear nature of recharge in such environments.

Taub.], also known as clusterbean, is a crop plant grown in semi-arid regions worldwide for the galactomannan gum of its seed, and as a forage, vegetable, and green manure. Despite the importance of guar and its products, uniform growth stage descriptions have not been established for the crop. Such descriptions allow for improved documentation and communication of the growth and phenological development of crops by researchers, producers, and others. Following models of other warm-season, indeterminant-growth legumes, such a system was developed for guar based on visually observable and sequential vegetative (V) and reproductive (R) plant events. The system was evaluated in two locations in dryland and irrigated conditions, using three morphologically contrasting guar varieties. The V stages begin with emergence (VE) and then are determined by counting the nodes on the main stem of the plant, with the cotyledonary node as zero [V0 to V(N)]. The R stages include R1 (First Flower), R2 (First Pod), R3 (First Seed or Full Pod), R4 (Full Seed), R5 (First Maturity), R6 (50% Maturity), and R7 (Harvest Maturity). The V and R stages may be reported alone or concurrently and applied at plant or crop scales. The stage descriptions apply to all growth morphologies of guar (i.e., branched and non-branched) and accommodate the indeterminant growth habit of the plant. Season-long data is reported from field studies on crop V and R stage progression, as well as data on crop growth, including biomass component partitioning, productivity, and canopy development.

Climate warming alters photosynthetic responses to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> in prairie plants	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Premise The impact of elevated CO(2)concentration ([CO2]) and climate warming on plant productivity in dryland ecosystems is influenced strongly by soil moisture availability. We predicted that the influence of warming on the stimulation of photosynthesis by elevated [CO2] in prairie plants would operate primarily through direct and indirect effects on soil water. Methods We measured light-saturated photosynthesis (A(net)), stomatal conductance (g(s)), maximum Rubisco carboxylation rate (V-cmax), maximum electron transport capacity (J(max)) and related variables in four C(3)plant species in the Prairie Heating and CO(2)Enrichment (PHACE) experiment in southeastern Wyoming. Measurements were conducted over two growing seasons that differed in the amount of precipitation and soil moisture content. Results A(net)in the C(3)subshrubArtemisia frigidaand the C(3)forbSphaeralcea coccineawas stimulated by elevated [CO2] under ambient and warmed temperature treatments. Warming by itself reducedA(net)in all species during the dry year, but stimulated photosynthesis inS. coccineain the wet year. In contrast,A(net)in the C(3)grassPascopyrum smithiiwas not stimulated by elevated [CO2] or warming under wet or dry conditions. Photosynthetic downregulation under elevated [CO2] in this species countered the potential stimulatory effect under improved water relations. Warming also reduced the magnitude of CO2-induced down-regulation in this grass, possibly by sustaining high levels of carbon utilization. Conclusions Direct and indirect effects of elevated [CO2] and warming on soil water was an overriding factor influencing patterns ofA(net)in this semi-arid temperate grassland, emphasizing the important role of water relations in driving grassland responses to global change.

Characterization of root traits for improvement of spring wheat in the Pacific Northwest	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Understanding the genetic basis of root traits provides essential information on a largely untapped resource for crop improvement, as roots are instrumental for the uptake of water and nutrients. However, breeding for improved root traits is challenging due to laborious and time-consuming root phenotyping in soil. Our studies sought to uncover spatiotemporal root-growth dynamics of mature plant root systems in five spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars, Louise, Alpowa, Hollis, Drysdale, and Dharwar Dry, and a facultative spring landrace, AUS28451 using the in situ minirhizotron technique. The 2-yr greenhouse study revealed that the root system grows rapidly after early node elongation to gain maximum size during anthesis, after which root growth slows and transitions to senescence. We were able to detect quantifiable differences among wheat cultivars in root traits in both 5-d old seedlings and root systems at anthesis. Furthermore, the positive correlation of the observed root traits with grain yield and the consistency in root traits observed using minirhizotrons and through extraction of young and mature root systems has reinforced the experimental results. A negative correlation was found between root number, area, and length and root diameter. We found that the spring wheat cultivars, AUS28451, Dharwar Dry, and Alpowa, had increased root number, area, and length, but also increased time to heading. The results from this study can be further leveraged to screen breeding lines for root traits of interest, as well as assess the heritability of root traits for dryland farming in the inland Pacific Northwest.

Current understanding about failure in adaptation systems tends to be generalised and course-grained. Yet, experiences for coping with and adapting to climate change tend to be local-specific, varying according to the magnitude and severity of climatic events. This study utilises the experiences of locals witnessing environmental changes associated with climate change. It uses participatory climate impact analysis to understand whether available livelihoods coping practices can withstand climatic impacts. Participatory research was used to rank the spectrum of livelihood options according to their significance in the face of climate change-induced drought and other socio-economic pressures. A coping capacity index (CCI) was used to estimate the level of adaptation limit imposed by each livelihood strategy, with composite CCI values generated to compare the coping capacities of villages studied. Given that most of the livelihoods options are climate dependent, and combined with other non-climatic drivers of vulnerability that are besetting rural areas in Zimbabwe, we argue that adaptation limits abound. Most of these limits are explained by the limitation of the environment that the villagers largely depend on for their survival. With the analytic capabilities of participants engaged, the article isolates three departure points for adaptation research, policy and practice: understanding the type and magnitude of climatic hazards thatthe locals are exposed to; assessment of their coping capacities and determination of adaptation barriers; and using their knowledge of the local environment to suggest interventions for evading adaptation barriers.

In this study, three MBAP applications were C0 (conventional N fertilization application) and C2 and C4 (MBAP applied at rates of 2 and 4 t ha(-1), respectively); three irrigation levels were W3 (nearly full irrigation, 85%-100% of field capacity), W2 (light deficit irrigation, 65%-75% of field capacity), and W1 (medium deficit irrigation, 55%-65% of field capacity). Under the same irrigation level, the MBAP significantly decreased soil bulk densities and increased soil hydraulic conductivities and soil water contents. The effects of irrigation levels on soil bulk densities and soil saturated hydraulic conductivities were not significant. Consequently, MBAP improved soil conditions for maize growth and increased grain and biomass yields, especially at the two deficit irrigation levels. Compared with that of C0, grain yields for C2 and C4 were increased by 52.8% and 39.3% under W2, and by 23.5% and 13.7% under W1, respectively. The MBAP and irrigation had significant interaction effects on evapotranspiration during sowing to jointing and on plant heights at 32 d after sowing. The incorporation of MBAP (2 t ha(-1)) and chemical fertilizer (111.8 kg N ha(-1)) resulted in the greatest yields under light deficit irrigation and seemed the best approach to improve soil physical properties and sustain maize productivity using limited water resources in dryland regions.																			0008-4271	1918-1841				JUN	2019	99	2					182	194		10.1139/cjss-2018-0091	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjss-2018-0091													WOS:000470782200007

The decomposition of PE film-sourced pollutants is directly associated with the enrichment of specific bacterial communities. We therefore hypothesized that plant biomass may act as an organic media to mediate the pollutant decomposition via reshaping bacterial communities. To validate this hypothesis, plant biomass (dried maize straw and living clover) was embedded at the underlying surface of PE film, to track the changes in the composition and function of bacterial communities in maize field across two years. The results indicated that both dry crop straw and alive clover massively promoted the & alpha;-diversity and abundance of dominant bacteria at plastisphere, relative to bulk soil. Bacterial communities tended to be clustered at plastisphere, forming the bacteria islands to enrich pollutant-degrading bacteria, such as Sphingobacterium, Arthrobacter and Paracoccus. As such, plastisphere bacteria islands substantially enhanced the degradation potential of chloroalkene and ben-zoate (p < 0.05). Simultaneously, bacterial network became stabilized and congregated at plastisphere, and markedly improved the abundance of plastisphere module hubs and connectors bacteria via stochastic process. Particularly, bacterial community composition and plastic film-sourced pollutants metabolism were evidently affected by soil pH, carbon and nitrogen sources that were mainly derived from the embedded biomass. To sum up, plant biomass embedding as a nature-based strategy (NbS) can positively mediate the decomposition of plastic-sourced pollutants through plastisphere bacteria island effects.

This study evaluated woody species density, diversity, cover, and biomass production from three regeneration approaches (EMTs): (1) Naturally Regenerated (ENR) exclosures, (2) exclosures with Soil and Water Conservation Structures (ECNR), and (3) those enriched with exotic and local plant species in addition to SWC structures (ECP) among which empirical evidence of comparisons are lacking for appropriate decision making of which restoration strategy to promote. Primary data were collected from a total of 72 study plots located across transects laid within exclosures and in adjacent grazing areas with similar ecological condition. Interview with 331 households and focus groups was used to further understand the effects. Regression analysis revealed that the mean difference in herbaceous and canopy cover, herbaceous and woody biomass, and woody species density and diversity of the three EMTs was statistically significantly higher than in the adjacent open grazing areas. Moreover, herbaceous biomass in ECP differed significantly from that of ECNR. The results indicated that ENR and ECP equally enhanced the selected vegetation parameters. This is predominantly attributed to the comparable responsiveness of many degraded areas to natural regeneration as they do to active regeneration approaches. Implementation of natural regeneration is suitable for immediate recruitment of strategy in terms of resources, time, and meeting objectives before decisions are made for assisted models of exclosure that require massive campaigns to construct soil and water conservation structures and huge seedling production in the dryland areas.

However, the importance of differing scales (alpha versus beta) is usually overlooked in biodiversity-ecosystem multifunctionality studies. Consequently, little is known about how precipitation regulates the relationship between multifunctionality and multiple components of alpha and beta diversity. AimsWe investigated geographic patterns of herbaceous plant diversity and ecosystem multifunctionality along a precipitation gradient spanning more than 2010 km in Northwest China. MethodsWe assessed the effects of herbaceous species, phylogenetic, and functional components at different scales on multifunctionality in drylands. ResultsThe alpha diversity of species and functional beta diversity were key components explaining the variation in multifunctionality. As the main environmental factor, MAP (mean annual precipitation) affected multifunctionality by changing the mediating variables (i.e., species alpha and functional beta diversity). More importantly, a certain precipitation threshold was detected for the relationship of multifunctionality to species alpha and functional beta diversity. MAPs of approximately 158 mm and 140 mm modulated this relationship (shifting it from uncorrelated to significantly correlated). ConclusionsOur findings provide insights into previously neglected mechanisms by which diversity in herbaceous layers at different scales affects ecosystem multifunctionality. It is highlighted that MAP regulates the relationship between diversity and multifunctionality in dryland ecosystems at different scales. Further, diversity may have substantial consequences for multifunctionality where MAP is higher. These empirical results provide a comprehensive understanding of the biodiversity-multifunctionality relationship in the context of precipitation, ultimately contributing to conservation and restoration programs for multifunctionality in drylands.																			2296-701X					FEB 9	2023	11								1084949	10.3389/fevo.2023.1084949	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2023.1084949													WOS:000942374500001

In this study, we examined the relationship between granule ripple development, morphology, and the surface grain-size distribution. We measured the morphology and particle-size distribution of granule ripples in China's Kumtagh Desert, and found an exponential relationship between ripple wavelength and average crest particle size, which contradicts previous results. We hypothesize the ripples resulted from creep of coarse particles caused by saltation impacts, accompanied by decreasing bed elevation, leading to crest migration and increased crest height. The size composition and wind regime determined the movement mode of particles, which controlled ripple development and size, but dry-wet and freeze-thaw cycles also contributed. We established a new conceptual model for the development of large granule ripples. Sand ripples and small granule ripples develop similarly, but large ripples did not form from merger of smaller ripples. We report for the first time that particles between 2.3 and 4.7 mm in diameter were missing in the ripple crests (confirmed in wind tunnel experiments). This gap affects the particle movement mode. Since the threshold wind speed for particle saltation at 4.7 mm approaches the regional maximum wind speed, quantifying the missing particles may permit prediction of regional maximum wind speeds, and has practical significance for identifying wind conditions elsewhere, including the surface of Mars.

Studies on the chloroplast genomes of them are favorable for understanding the diversity and phylogeny of Zygophyllaceae. Here, we sequenced and assembled the whole chloroplast genomes of T. mongolica, Z. xanthoxylon, and Z. fabago, and performed comparative genomic and phylogenetic analysis. The total size, structure, gene content and orders of these three chloroplast genomes were similar, and the three chloroplast genomes exhibited a typical quadripartite structure with a large single-copy region (LSC; 79,696-80,291 bp), a small single-copy region (SSC; 16,462-17,162 bp), and two inverted repeats (IRs; 4,288-4,413 bp). A total of 107 unique genes were identified from the three chloroplast genomes, including 70 protein-coding genes, 33 tRNAs, and 4 rRNAs. Compared with other angiosperms, the three chloroplast genomes were significantly reduced in overall length due to an unusual 16-24 kb shrinkage of IR regions and loss of the 11 genes which encoded subunits of NADH dehydrogenase. Genome-wide comparisons revealed similarities and variations between the three species and others. Phylogenetic analysis based on the three chloroplast genomes supported the opinion that Zygophyllaceae belonged to Zygophyllales in Fabids, and Z. xanthoxylon and Z. fabago belonged to Zygophyllum. The genome-wide comparisons revealed the similarity and variations between the chloroplast genomes of the three Zygophylloideae species and other plant species.

Seasonal Flight Patterns of <i>Chrysodeixis includens</i> (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in the Florida Panhandle and Inventory of Plusiine Species Cross-Attracted to Synthetic Pheromone	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												Chysodeixis includens (Walker) is a polyphagous economic pest in agricultural landscapes. To detect the occurrence of this pest in the field, trapping using sex pheromone lures is often implemented. However, other plusiine species are cross-attracted to these lures and may be misidentified as C. includens due to their morphological similarities. The objectives of this study were to provide region-specific information on the abundance of C. includens throughout the year as well as document the occurrence of related plusiines crossattracted to C. includens sex pheromone traps in the Florida Panhandle. Twelve commercial fields of peanut and twelve commercial fields of cotton located across Escambia, Santa Rosa, and Jackson counties were monitored with Trece delta traps baited with C. includens sex pheromone lures (Alpha Scents, Inc.; West Linn, OR) from June 2017 to June 2019. There was no difference in C. includens flight across dryland or irrigated fields. Identifications revealed that in addition to C. includens, the following species of the subfamily Plusiinae were crossed-attracted: Argyrogramma verruca (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), Trichoplusia ni (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), Ctenoplusia oxygramma (Geyer) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and Rachiplusia ou (Guenee) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). The occurrence of each species in the region and their flight phenology are documented. Chysodeixis includens abundance was greatest in September and decreased through December. Due to the high abundance of C. oxygramma and similar flight phenology to C. includens, this is the likeliest species to skew estimations and influence management decisions of C. includens, especially early in the crop season, when C. includens abundance is low.

Methods We investigated plant productivity, shrub demography, and resource availability in a 5-year field experiment involving three levels of precipitation (ambient, + 20% precipitation, + 40% precipitation) and two levels of nitrogen addition (0, 60 kg N ha(- 1) yr(- 1)) in a desert shrubland of northern China. Results Increased precipitation had similar positive effects on shrub and herbaceous productivity and, thus, did not alter the community composition. However, nitrogen enrichment dramatically increased herbaceous productivity but tended to decrease shrub productivity. Five years after the experimental manipulation, increased precipitation and nitrogen enrichment significantly altered shrub demography. Increased precipitation decreased the number and cover of small shrubs but increased those of large shrubs. Nitrogen enrichment largely decreased the number and cover of small shrubs, whereas large shrubs showed a higher resistance. Structural equation modeling revealed that nitrogen-enhanced herbaceous competition for water and light potentially reduced shrub growth, especially the growth of small shrubs. Conclusions Our results suggest that large shrubs can coexist with herbs, whereas small shrubs tend to be competitively excluded from the system under enhanced precipitation and nitrogen deposition. Nitrogen enrichment may lead to continued declines in shrub recruitment and growth, and a conversion to grassland. Our findings highlight the competitive and demographic mechanisms underlying the responses of woody communities to global change.					bai, yuxuan/HRB-7170-2023; She, Weiwei/P-4164-2015; Bai, Yuxuan/ABB-6460-2020	She, Weiwei/0000-0002-0911-9169; 													0032-079X	1573-5036				MAR	2021	460	1-2					333	345		10.1007/s11104-020-04810-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-020-04810-y		JAN 2021											WOS:000607330400003

The analysis of climate extreme indices at the municipal level is of the uttermost importance to the overall study of climate variability and regional food security. Corn, bean, and cassava are among the most cultivated temporary subsistence crops. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between subsistence agriculture productivity and the behavior of rainfall extreme indices in the Rio Grande do Norte state in the period from 1980 to 2013. We used the dataset provided by Xavier (2016) and the climate extreme indices obtained through the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices. Crop productivity data were retrieved from the Municipal Agriculture Survey from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics system. The methodology evaluated the behavior and the relationship between agricultural productivity time series and extreme precipitation indicators. We applied the following statistical techniques: descriptive analysis, time series trend analysis by the Mann-Kendall test, cluster analysis, and analysis of variance to check for equal means between identified groups. Cluster analysis was considered an adequate tool for the comprehension of data spatial distribution, allowing the identification of five homogenous subregions with different precipitation patterns. Rainfall extreme indices allowed the analysis of regional conditions regarding consecutive dry days, annual precipitation in wet days, and heavy rainfall. Trends were identified in these indices and they were significantly correlated with dryland crops productivity, indicating a direct relationship between water availability and regional agroclimatic stress.

Semiarid cultivation is a classical strategy for achieving high water productivity (WP) with lower labor inputs. However, it remains largely unknown whether the application of "super" or drought-resistant hybrid rice could achieve higher economic benefits (WP and yield) under semiarid cultivation. This study attempted to combine three irrigation management systems (semiarid rice cultivation, traditional flood irrigation, and dryland cultivation) with two cultivars (Yangliangyou 6, YLY6, a super hybrid rice genotype; Hanyou 113, HY113, a drought-resistant rice genotype), and evaluate their effects on the water-saving ability and yield (the economic benefits). The two genotypes showed no significant differences in grain yield under the semiarid and flood irrigation, and both had a greater WP (13.8-51.8%) under semiarid cultivation than under flood irrigation. YLY6 produced more panicles (P < .05), more spikelets per panicle (P < .05), and higher grain yield (P < .01) than HY113. Semiarid cultivation plus YLY6 showed higher stomatal conductance and net photosynthetic rate (P < .05), resulting in higher biomass accumulation, grain yield, and WP compared with those under other treatments. YLY6 under semiarid cultivation had greater stem water content and leaf water potential, and thus showed improvement of leaf gas exchange characteristics. In conclusion, super hybrid rice has the potential to achieve greater WP and higher grain yield under semiarid irrigation, and this combination may be introduced for sustainable rice production.

Winter canola produces marketable end-products while improving soil health and disrupting pest and disease cycles. Although annual production of WC in Washington State has increased in the recent decade, little regional fertility research has been conducted. As a result, WC is commonly fertilized in a manner similar to hard red spring wheat. Compared with wheat, WC has a deep and aggressive tap root system that can grow to depths of 180 cm to reach nutrients and water. Thus, WC requires a different N management strategy than wheat. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the influence of soil residual N and fertilizer N application rate (range, 0-240 kg N ha(-1)) and timing (fall, spring, or split fall/spring) on WC yield and oil and protein concentrations. The study took place over a 2-yr period at seven locations across four agroecological classes. There was no yield response to N rate at six of the seven sites due to canola's high N uptake efficiency and the soils' high residual N (92-224 kg inorganic N ha(-1)) after wheat-fallow. Increasing N rates and split or spring application resulted in lower oil/protein ratios. In addition, maximum yields correlated with total available water. Therefore, N management for WC should be based on soil test residual + mineralizable N, total available water, and end-use quality.

A redescription of the late Carboniferous trematopid <i>Actiobates peabodyi</i> from Garnett, Kansas	ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Dissorophoids are a diverse clade of predominantly Permo-Carboniferous temnospondyls with a wide geographic distribution and broad ecological diversity. Each of the various dissorophoid clades first appears in the late Carboniferous, but their records are relatively sparse and fragmentary compared to those of the early Permian when dissorophoids reach their peak diversity and distribution, particularly in terrestrial environments where they are by far the most taxonomically diverse clade of non-amniote tetrapods. This provides an impetus for further study of the late Carboniferous terrestrial dissorophoids in order to contextualize the early stages in the clade's radiation into terrestrial ecosystems. Here we present a redescription of the late Carboniferous trematopid Actiobates peabodyi from Kansas, USA, which is represented by a nearly complete skeleton and which represents the earliest occurrence of trematopids in North America. Only the skull was previously described, and the taxon has been largely overlooked in the context of early terrestrial dissorophoid evolution. Here, we provide an updated cranial description, the first postcranial description, and a discussion of the position of A. peabodyi in the context of olsoniform evolution. Our most significant finding is the characterization of postcranial anatomy that is highly similar to that of later trematopid taxa. This high degree of conservatism indicates that the earliest trematopids were already well adapted for terrestrial environments, and post-Carboniferous radiations of olsoniforms may be attributed to an expansion of the dryland terrestrial environments in which these taxa already thrived, rather than to novel acquisition of adaptive features later in the clade's evolution.

Urbanization alters belowground invertebrate community structure in semi-arid regions: A comparison of lawns, biofilters and sage scrub	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												As the proportion of the human population living in cities continues to increase, understanding the factors affecting urban biodiversity Is crucial to enhancing conservation efforts, urban ecosystem function, and human wellbeing. Here we present the results of the first comparative study of belowground invertebrate communities in urban soils (lawns and biofilters) and remnant patches of native coastal sage scrub (CSS) in a semi-arid urban environment. Among 12 sites sampled in La Jolla, California, USA, invertebrate community composition was most homogeneous among lawns, which differed significantly in composition from both biofilters and CSS. In almost all other aspects of invertebrate community diversity metrics (richness, evenness, diversity) as well as environmental factors (moisture, organic matter, plant cover and richness), lawns differed significantly from native CSS habitats, but biofilters were intermediate and not significantly different from other habitat types. Lawn soil invertebrate evenness and diversity were significantly lower, but density was highest in lawns, with higher densities of oligochaetes (Megadrilacea, Enchytraeidae), fly larvae (Sciaridae, Chironomidae), mites (Oribatida, Mesostigmata), and springtails (Poduromorpha, Symphypleona) in lawns relative to CSS. Differences in soil moisture, organic matter, and plant, tree, and building cover explained 40-62% of the variability in invertebrate density, richness, diversity, and evenness among sites. These findings suggest a shift in belowground invertebrate community structure that may be common among urbanizing semi-arid environments. The amendment of urban dryland soils with organic matter and moisture alters the presence and population density of several invertebrate taxa, and may cause a transition toward dominance by desiccation-intolerant litter transformers.

It is known that mulching practices can maintain soil hydrothermal environment and improve crop production. However, it is not clear how mulching affects root-associated microbiomes in the successive growth stages of broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum L.). Here, we investigated the effects of traditional flat planting (TP), plastic film mulching (PFM), and ridge-furrow rainwater planting (RF) on the bacterial and fungal diversity, composition, co-occurrence networks, and assembly in bulk soil, rhizosphere, and root compartments at the jointing and flowering stages of broomcorn millet. Bacterial and fungal community composition and structure in all three compartments were more affected by the PFM and RF treatments than by the TP treatment. Mulching measures did not affect the bulk soil bacterial and fungal diversity, but reduced the bacterial diversity and increased the fungal diversity of rhizosphere and root system at flowering stage of broomcorn millet. Indicator taxa analysis showed more shared and specific species in rhizosphere bacterial and fungal networks. Mulching induced specific responses from taxa/modules of bacterial and fungal co-occurrence networks in the three compartments. In the bulk soil and rhizosphere meta-networks, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were the keystone taxa, and the relative abundance of Actinobacteria in root meta-networks decreased in the PFM and RF treatments compared to that in the TP treatment. We also noted that mulching affected the bacterial assembly process in three compartments, but did not affect the fungal assembly process. Overall, our findings provide basic insights into the broomcorn millet root-associated ecosystem and sustainable development of drylands.

Temperature rise and human activities have severe impacts on the fragile ecosystems. Since the 1970s, nearly half the great lakes in Central Asia have shrunk and rivers are drying rapidly owing to climate changes and human activities. Water shortage and ecological crisis have attracted extensive international attention. In general, ecosystem services in Central Asia are declining, particularly with respect to biodiversity, water, and soil conservation. Furthermore, the annual average temperature and annual precipitation in Central Asia increased by 0.30 degrees C/decade and 6.9 mm/decade in recent decades, respectively. Temperature rise significantly affected glacier retreat in the Tianshan Mountains and Pamir Mountains, which may intensify water shortage in the 21(st) century. The increase in precipitation cannot counterbalance the aggravation of water shortage caused by the temperature rise and human activities in Central Asia. The population of Central Asia is growing gradually, and its economy is increasing steadily. Moreover, the agricultural land has not been expended in the last two decades. Thus, water and ecological crises, such as the Aral Sea shrinkage in the 21(st) century, cannot be attributed to agriculture extension any longer. Unbalanced regional development and water interception/transfer have led to the irrational exploitation of water resources in some watersheds, inducing downstream water shortage and ecological degradation. In addition, accelerated industrialization and urbanization have intensified this process. Therefore, all Central Asian countries must urgently reach a consensus and adopt common measures for water and ecological protection.																			1674-6767	2194-7783				SEP	2021	13	9					881	890		10.1007/s40333-021-0084-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-021-0084-3		SEP 2021											WOS:000698111800001

Here, we assessed the ecological drivers that regulate the assembly processes of abundant (ABS) and rare (RBS) bacterial subcommunities based on 162 soil samples collected in an arid inland river basin of China. The results showed that: (1) ABS exhibited a steeper distance-decay slope, and were more strongly affected by dispersal limitation (75.5% and 84.5%), than RBS in surface and subsurface soil. RBS were predominantly controlled by variable selection (54.6% and 50.2%). (2) Soil electric conductivity played a decisive role in mediating the balance between deterministic and stochastic processes of ABS and RBS in surface soil, increasing soil electric conductivity increased the importance of deterministic process. For subsurface soil, soil available phosphorus (SAP) and soil pH drove the balance in the assembly processes of ABS and RBS, respectively. The RBS shifted from determinism to stochasticity with decreased pH, while the dominance of deterministic processes was higher in low-SAP sites. (3) Groundwater depth seasonality had substantial effects on the assembly processes of ABS and RBS, but groundwater depth seasonality affected them indirectly mainly by regulating soil properties. Collectively, our study provides robust evidence that groundwater-driven variations in soil properties mediates the community assembly process of soil bacteria in arid inland river basins. This finding is of importance for forecasting the dynamics of soil microbial community and soil process in response to current and future depleted groundwater.

The vessel wall thickness-vessel diameter relationship across woody angiosperms	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Premise Comparative anatomy is necessary to identify the extremes of combinations of functionally relevant structural traits, to ensure that physiological data cover xylem anatomical diversity adequately, and thus achieve a global understanding of xylem structure-function relations. A key trait relationship is that between xylem vessel diameter and wall thickness of both the single vessel and the double vessel+adjacent imperforate tracheary element (ITE). Methods We compiled a comparative data set with 1093 samples, 858 species, 350 genera, 86 families, and 33 orders. We used broken linear regression and an algorithm to explore changes in parameter values from linear regressions using subsets of the data set to identify a threshold, at 90-mu m vessel diameter, in the wall thickness-diameter relationship. Results Below 90 mu m diameter for vessels, virtually any wall thickness could be associated with virtually any diameter. Below this threshold, selection is free to favor a very wide array of combinations, such as very thick walls and narrow vessels in ITE-free herbs, or very thin-walled, wide vessels in evergreen dryland pioneers. Above 90 mu m, there was a moderate positive relationship. Conclusions Our analysis shows that the space of vessel wall thickness-diameter combinations is very wide, with selection apparently eliminating individuals with vessel walls "too thin" for their diameter. Most importantly, our survey revealed poorly studied plant hydraulic syndromes (functionally significant trait combinations). These data suggest that the full span of trait combinations, and thus the minimal set of hydraulic syndromes requiring study to span woody plant functional diversity adequately, remains to be documented.

The loss of forage is critical, especially when droughts are frequent and prolonged. Interventions to improve pastoralists' resilience include policies that encourage livelihood diversification, that is, promoting enterprises that are less impacted by climate variability. This paper evaluates a reseeding project among pastoralists from Lake Baringo, Kenya, with the goal of rehabilitating degraded lands. Field owners participated in a survey and answered both quantitative and qualitative questions relating to their field and household characteristics. We use livestock herd size to assess households' conditions. We hypothesize that field characteristics including total land size reseeded, the total number of fields and the number of field locations, years of experience of working in reseeded fields, type of management, fencing, and the number of income-generating activities have an effect on herd size maintenance during drought. We find that the total number of fields and the number of income-generating activities have significant explanatory power in predicting a household's ability to maintain its herd size during drought. These factors are related to fine-scale control over land use which contributes to maintaining herd size. These findings suggest that reseeding by local pastoralists could be replicated and up-scaled into other dryland counties of Kenya and sub-Saharan Africa as a promising intervention to improve resilience to climate variability, alleviate poverty, and improve environmental conditions.

Seasonal inundation dynamics and water balance of the Mara Wetland, Tanzania based on multi-temporal Sentinel-2 image classification	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Anthropogenic hydrologic alternations are a threat to flood dependent wetland ecosystems like The Mara Wetland in Tanzania, which plays an important role in regulating the quality, timing and magnitude of the flow of water into Lake Victoria and provides natural resources and habitat for a variety of species. Baseline information on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the seasonal inundation is critical to manage potential threats such as dam construction and local climate change, but is challenging to acquire due to the heterogeneity of the landscape caused by the interspersion of open water and emergent vegetation. In this study, intra- and inter-annual inundation pattern of the Mara Wetland are reproduced for 2017-2019 using remotely sensed data. A Random Forest (RF) algorithm is trained bi-seasonally, using eight Sentinel-2 bands, five water- and vegetation-indices and a Digital Surface Model (DSM) to classify the land cover of the wetland region in a semi-automated way, by processing a total of 73 Sentinel-2 scenes based on wet- and dry-state training images for 2017. The scenes are classified into seven classes; three wetland- and four dryland-classes. The overall classification accuracy achieved (based on an independent validation set) is 98.6%. The inundation extents are used in combination with available hydrological field-data to estimate the water balance. The seasonal expansion and contraction of the wetland follows a consistent bi-modal regime, and the results from the water balance affirm the importance of river-flow during the dry-season and local precipitation for the seasonal fluctuations in water-availability.

The Mujib basin is considered as one of the major sources for water production in Jordan, while the agricultural production is the main consumer sector for water in the basin. High multi-temporal multi-spectral resolutions Sentinel-2b satellite images were used to identify the land use types using the supervised classification that applied on spring and summer growing season. The results show that the temporal NDVI curve is very useful in distinguishing between different crops type with high details, and is used in assisting the agricultural land use pattern. Multi-temporal NDVI images were used to identify the cropping pattern within the agricultural land using the unsupervised classification approach. The results show that the rainfed agriculture is confined in the high rainfall zones with one period of growing season, while the irrigated agricultural crops are spreading in the basin over the whole year with different periods of growing seasons. Irrigated vegetables and tree crops are the dominant agricultural crops in the basin with more than 70% of cultivated land. Most of the irrigated vegetables and trees are grown in the summer seasons under high temperatures conditions which consumes the highest percentage of irrigated water.

Heath and peat swamp forests are Bornean lowland forest types with distinctive plant communities that primarily correspond to a soil water gradient from dryland heath to waterlogged peat swamps. Although tree diversity of Bornean heath and peat swamp forests is well described, little is known of their woody seedling communities. This study investigated diversity, abundance and community composition of woody seedlings in mixed peat-swamp (MSF), heath Within twenty-two 3 x 3 m plots in these forest types, seedlings of 50 < cm height < 100 were censused and taxonomically identified, and measurements of selected environmental and soil properties were obtained. In total, 84 species of woody seedlings from 71 genera were recorded, with Myrtaceae most abundant in MSF, KF and SAP, while Dipterocarpaceae and Sapotaceae were most abundant in HF. Mean seedling abundance and diversity indices did not differ between forest types, but mean species richness was significantly higher in MSF than SAP. Woody seedling community composition differed between forest types and was influenced by soil properties, with MSF seedling communities influenced by total K concentration and soil pH, while SAP was influenced by soil gravimetric water content and total P concentration. These findings highlight the need for increased research on seedling ecology in tropical heath and peat swamp forest formations to further elucidate mechanisms underlying species diversity in these forests, and to guide programmes for their conservation, sustainable management and reforestation.																			1819-754X						2022	28									10.19189/MaP.2021.MEH.StA.2160	http://dx.doi.org/10.19189/MaP.2021.MEH.StA.2160													WOS:000792205600001

Agronomic Performance of <i>Brassicaceae</i> Oilseeds in Multiple Environments Across the Western USA	BIOENERGY RESEARCH												Brassicaceae oilseed crops can provide rotation benefits to dryland wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and supply feedstock for biofuel production. However, growers face decisions about what oilseed crop is best suited for an environment. The objective of this study was to determine how varying production environments affect the agronomic performance of modern cultivars of six Brassicaceae crop species and identify ideal genotypes for seven growing environments spanning four ecoregions. A field experiment was replicated in Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, and Oregon, USA, between 2013 and 2016 to measure seed and oil yields of seed for four cultivars of Brassica napus, two of B. carinata, two of B. juncea, two of Sinapis alba, one of B. rapa, and one of Camelina sativa. Also, delta C-13 signature of seed was used as an indicator of water limitation. Generally, across all genotypes, seed and oil yields increased with increased growing season precipitation. Modern commercial cultivars of B. napus and B. juncea had the highest seed oil contents and generally produced the greatest oil yields across most environments, although they were not always the highest seed yielders. For instance, B. carinata over six site years in North Dakota and Minnesota yielded greater than B. napus producing as much as 2471 kg ha(-1) in Minnesota. Camelina produced competitive seed yields in some of the drier environments and its delta C-13 signature indicated that it had the greatest drought resistance. However, seed oil content of some of these high yielding genotypes may need improvement before they are viable as biofuel feedstock.

Due to changes in climatic conditions and cropping systems, the crop is being exposed to severe drought and heat stress during its reproductive period, which leads to significant yield losses and fluctuations in grain nutrient accumulation. The study was conducted with 140 diverse genotypes under nonstress, drought, and heat stress conditions to estimate their effects on grain nutrient (protein, Fe and Zn) contents and identify the marker-trait associations. Analysis of variance revealed highly significant differences among genotypes for nutrient content under respective planting conditions. The seed yield was negatively associated with the grain Fe (r = -0.37, -0.25, 0.11) and Zn (r = -0.49, -0.35, -0.72) under respective planting conditions. The PCA indicated that PC1 was positively associated with grain Fe in non-stress and heat, while Zn in all planting conditions, whereas PC2 was positively influenced by protein content followed by grain yield. Cluster analysis identified eight clusters, of which cluster VI showed maximum cluster means for Fe (73 mg kg-1) and Zn (48.1 mg kg-1). The Genome-wide association study revealed, a total of 181 MTAs for grain Fe, Zn, and protein content in all three growing conditions. A total of 4, 2, and 48 SNPs for grain Fe and Zn content, whereas, 66, 46, 15 SNPs for grain protein content have shown significant association under non-stress, drought, and heat stress, respectively. One SNP each on chr1 (S1_35622241; P < 3.47 x10-6) and chr4 (S4_44607232; P < 1.35 x10-5) was co-associated under drought and non-stress conditions for protein and Fe, respectively. The identified robust MTAs will be validated and used in marker-assisted selection towards the rapid development of nutrient-rich varieties.

Timely and accurate flood forecasting can effectively reduce losses to human life and property and improve the utilization of flood resources. In this study, a real-time flood classification and prediction method (RFC-P) was constructed based on factor analysis, the k-means++ clustering algorithm, SSE, a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and the M-EIES model. Model parameters of different flood types were obtained to forecast floods. The RFC-P method was applied to the Jingle sub-basin in Shanxi Province. The results showed that the RFC-P method can be used for the real-time classification and prediction of floods. The parameters of the flood classification and prediction model were consistent with the characteristics of the flood events. Compared with the results of unclassified predictions, the Nash coefficient increased by 5%-11.62%, the relative error of the average flood peak was reduced by 6.08%-12.7%, the relative error of the average flood volume was reduced by 5.74%-8.07%, and the time difference of the average peak was reduced by 43%-66% based on the proposed approach. The methodology proposed in this study can be used to identify extreme flood events and provide scientific support for flood classification and prediction, flood control and disaster reduction in river basins, and the efficient utilization of water resources.																			0920-4741	1573-1650				JAN	2022	36	1					103	117		10.1007/s11269-021-03014-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-021-03014-y		NOV 2021											WOS:000718092200003
J	Yang, Y; Cheng, H; Gao, H; An, SS				Yang, Yang; Cheng, Huan; Gao, Han; An, Shaoshan			Response and driving factors of soil microbial diversity related to global nitrogen addition	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												It is increasingly evident that soil microorganisms play a substantial role in ecosystem processes, which occupy a large part of genetic diversity in terrestrial ecosystems. During the past decades, nitrogen (N) addition induced by human has been regarded as the main driver of global changes to soil microecological processes. Although growing studies demonstrated the loss of biodiversity due to N addition in regional scale, the role of global N addition on soil microbial diversity is lacking. Here, we sought to illuminate the impacts and driving factors of soil microbial diversity in relation to global N addition using a meta-analysis from 1,078 paired observations in 212 studies. We found a negative influence of global N addition on soil microbial diversity, and the reduction of soil microbial diversity was determined by land use types, N fertility types, methods, N addition rates, and duration. In fact, there was a linear decrease of soil microbial diversity along the latitudinal gradient, and N addition-induced acidification was the predominant contributor to the reduction of soil microbial diversity. Both of soil properties (pH, soil organic carbon, soil total N, and soil microbial biomass C) and climatic factors (mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation) determined soil microbial diversity under global N addition. It was noted that soil fungal diversity was more adaptable to acidic environments, whereas soil bacterial diversity was more adaptable to neutral environment. Most importantly, soil fungal diversity was more sensitive than soil bacterial diversity under global N addition. Our meta-analysis provides a new insight in understanding the key role of global N addition in shaping soil microbial diversity. Thereby, we recommend that future research should be focused on the soil microbial processes using manipulative controlled experiments, which identify the available measures to reduce the loss of soil microbial diversity globally.

Nutrient balance is used to evaluate the state of soil fertility, rate of nutrient depletion, sustainability of land productivity, as well as to take the appropriate management decisions. This study was conducted to quantify soil nutrient balance and stocks on smallholder farms at Agew Mariam watershed, in northern Ethiopia in the 2020/21 season. The inflows-outflows of NPK into, and out of barley, tef, and wheat farms were determined through, field measurement, laboratory analysis and interviews. The nutrient balance in each crop was quantified by subtracting nutrient outputs from the inputs. The N partial balance of barley, tef and wheat was -66, -9.8, and -50.7 kg ha-1 yr- 1fields, respectively. The P balance was also -5.9, 0.9, and -2.6 kg ha-1 yr- 1 for barley, tef, and wheat fields, respectively. The K balance was -12.3, -3.2, and -5.4 kg ha-1 yr- 1 in barley, tef, and wheat fields, respectively. The analysis revealed that N, P, and K had negative values except for P in tef. The stock of N was 1295, 1510, and 1240 in barley, tef, and wheat kg ha- 1fields, respectively. The P stock was 63, 18.7, and 27.5 kg ha-1 in barley, tef, and wheat farms, respectively. Similarly, K stock was 1092.7, 1059.4, and 1090.6 kg ha-1 in barley, tef, and wheat cropping systems, respectively. Reversing the imbalance between inflows and outflows via adding organic and inorganic fertilizer is essential for barley, tef, and wheat cropping systems in the study area.																				2405-8440				APR	2023	9	4							e14832	10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e14832	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e14832		MAR 2023						37025875					WOS:000999813000001

As climate changes faster than breeding, we focused on genotypic and environmental effects on grain production and quality of present wheat cultivars. To mimic the continuous challenges farmers face given the erratic rainy seasonal and temperature pattern of the Eastern Mediterranean, 15 commercial hard spring wheat (HSW) cultivars were evaluated at Gilat Research Center, Israel, over four seasons constituting 33 independent dryland field environments. Grains of HSW samples from commercial and experimental nurseries across Israel over three seasons were also analyzed to represent the Eastern Mediterranean wheat agroclimatic span. Samples were analyzed for grain yield and quality traits. High humidity and mild temperature during grain filling were associated with higher production, flour extraction, and dough extensibility; whereas high precipitation was mainly associated with lower protein, lower gluten content, and dough tenacity. Correlation between grain protein content and wet gluten was affected by environment and is cultivar dependent, as precipitation during a specific phase plays a major factor for some cultivars, while others are affected more by temperature, humidity, or other factors. Test weight and gluten index showed the clearest relation between performance and variation, enabling to identify cultivar stability across environments. Stable cultivars are more acceptable in the market, however, if a specific quality parameter is highly important for the millers and/or the bakers then the stability of this parameter under multiple growth conditions might serve as a decision support tool for on-farm commercial cultivar selection.																			0002-1962	1435-0645				JUL	2023	115	4					1622	1639		10.1002/agj2.21351	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.21351		MAY 2023											WOS:000983929600001

Nitrogen use in spring wheat affected by crop diversification, management, and tillage	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Dryland wheat production potential in the northern Great Plains (NGP) often is limited by N availability affected by various management practices. A 4-yr study was conducted in northeast Montana to relate spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) productivity and N utilization to management system (conventional and ecological), tillage (till and no-till), and four crop rotations (continuous spring wheat, spring wheat-pea [Pisum sativum L.], spring wheat-hay barley [Hordeum vulgare L.]-pea, and spring wheat-hay barley-corn [Zea mays L.]-pea). Ecological management included greater seeding rates, delayed planting dates, banded N fertilizer, and increased stubble height compared with conventional management with standard seeding rates and planting dates, short stubble height, and broadcast N fertilizer. Continuous spring wheat showed the lowest grain yield, with the least efficient utilization of N compared with 2-, 3-, and 4-yr rotations. Mineral nitrogen use efficiency was 37% lower for continuous wheat than for other rotations. Increasing the complexity of crop rotation had little impact on wheat production or N relationships. The delayed planting date associated with ecological management of spring wheat contributed to 33% less efficient use of N compared with an early planting date with conventional management. Overall, results indicated that crop rotation and management system often affected N relationships with wheat production, whereas the effects of tillage differed with year. Differences in yield and N use of spring wheat varied among years, underscoring the need to refine management systems given the highly variable precipitation patterns typical of the NGP.

J	Meinhold, K; Darr, D				Meinhold, Kathrin; Darr, Dietrich			Using a multi-stakeholder approach to increase value for traditional agroforestry systems: the case of baobab (<i>Adansonia digitata</i> L.) in Kilifi, Kenya	AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS												The baobab tree (Adansonia digitata L.) is an integral component of many dryland farming systems in sub-Sahara Africa. Such traditional agroforestry systems can foster a variety of benefits; besides positive livelihood implications baobab can particularly address food security objectives due to its highly nutritious fruits. However, many bottlenecks persist inhibiting the broader potential of indigenous trees in farming systems and their increased utilisation and commercialisation. We suggest that traditional farming systems with baobab trees can be advanced by stimulating the emergence of local markets for baobab products while promoting businesses and innovations aimed at meeting the arising market demand. Increasing the perceived value of local agroforestry products in combination with facilitating additional commercialisation pathways will in turn lead to food security and livelihood benefits. Using a multi-stakeholder approach such considerations were put into practice in Kilifi, Kenya, by initiating a community-based enterprise development producing high-quality baobab powder and oil. Initial results demonstrate behavioural changes, an improved practical knowhow with regard to baobab management and utilisation, and an increased consumption of baobab, which may already contribute to food security objectives. Baobab is increasingly seen as a valuable resource as opposed to 'food for the poor' and a tree possessed by evil spirits. This may lay the groundwork for further value addition activities and enterprise development in the communities. With baobab being a common, yet so far underutilised feature of local farming systems in Kilifi, activities based on its increasing commercialisation can be complementary and easily integrable to prevailing livelihood strategies.

Although vegetation phenology is a key factor for the classification of land use, understanding of the phenological change of abandoned farmland is lacking. Using harmonic analysis of NDVI and NDWI extracted from Landsat imagery, this study investigates the distinctive phenological characteristics of abandoned farmland, which contrasts with that of three other agricultural types (paddy, agricultural field, orchard) in the study site of Gwangyang City in Jeollanam Province, South Korea. The results suggest that abandoned farmland has higher overall greenness coverage and overall water content in vegetation than the other uses. In terms of both indices, abandoned farmlands changed with relatively less fluctuation than those of other uses, suggesting the existence of constant and unmanaged vegetation from ecological succession, which differs from crop fields that undergo cultivation procedures. The significant harmonic components differed among agricultural types and vegetation indices. In paddy, NDVI was explained with multiple, higher-order harmonic components, while in other types only first-order components met the 5% statistical significance level. With NDWI, land types were more clearly discernible, because of the different cultivation procedures involving water: wet-field method (paddy), dryland farming (orchard, agricultural field), and no cultivation (abandoned farmland). The analysis confirms that harmonic analysis could be useful in discerning abandoned farmland among areas of active agricultural use and shows that the statistical significance of harmonic terms can be employed as indicators of different agricultural types. The observed pattern of the geographic distribution of abandoned farmland has policy implications for the promotion of sustainable reuse of marginal farmland.																			1548-1603	1943-7226				APR 2	2020	57	3					338	351		10.1080/15481603.2019.1698490	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2019.1698490		DEC 2019											WOS:000501632300001

Field experiments were performed in a triplicated randomized block design. Combined analysis of variance revealed significant differences between lines for the most of traits studied. Traits of the number of fertile stems (NFS), number of grains per spike (NGPS) and thousand-kernel weight (TKW) were not affected by conditions x lines interaction effects. According to the stepwise regression analysis NFS and NGPS entered in the model and were recognized as the most effective traits on durum wheat grain yield under both irrigated and rain-fed conditions. Whiles NFS and NGPS have been recommended as selection criteria for increasing yield of durum wheat only in the rain-fed condition based on the result of path analysis and indirect effects. Advanced Wheat Line (ADWL)-3, ADWL-8, ADWL-10 and ADWL -7 are suggested useful considering production of desirable NFS, and ADWL -12 and ADWL -16 considering production of desirable NGPS, for further breeding programs and commercial release in the rain-fed condition. Days to physiological maturity (DM) has been recommended as a selection criterion only in the irrigated condition. ADWL -5 and ADWL-1 were selected considering maximum number of DM whiles these lines can adjust their buffered state in response to environmental fluctuations in such a way that they give maximum economic grain yield.

Physical modeling of inland freshwater lens formation and evolution in drylands	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Dryland inland freshwater lenses (IFLs) that have been topographically induced are represented using physically modeled laboratory simulations, to characterize the stages of IFL evolution (i.e. formation, migration, degradation) as a function of recharge rate. Arid regions with shallow brackish to saline groundwater possess IFLs. The position and geometry (i.e. thickness, length) of IFLs over varying temporal and spatial scales is poorly understood due to their transient nature. The physically modeled IFLs in this study formed from an initial recharge pulse, after which IFL geometry was measured over time as it flowed in the direction of simulated groundwater flow. The time required for an IFL to reach the maximum thickness exhibited a negative exponential correlation to recharge rate. At IFL formation, thickness and length were positively correlated, and the ratio of IFL thickness to length exhibited a positive exponential correlation to recharge rate. After IFL formation, the central position of the simulated IFLs migrated laterally in the direction of groundwater flow at a velocity less than the range of applied recharge rates and greater than the groundwater flow velocities. The time required for the IFL to reach a minimum thickness, or IFL degradation, exhibited a positive exponential correlation to recharge rate. The Dupuit-Ghyben-Herzberg solution used to model coastal freshwater lens thickness was tested against the physically modeled IFLs and deemed invalid. A correction factor and modified solution are provided to predict IFL thickness, providing motivation for future analytical and numerical studies on inland variable-density groundwater systems in arid regions globally.

The importance of nonrainfall waters on vegetation water status in arid ecosystems is receiving increasing attention. However, a clear understanding on how common plant water status benefits from nonrainfall waters, the impacts of different types of fog and dew events on vegetation water status, and the vegetation uptake mechanisms of nonrainfall waters is still lacking. In this study, we used concurrent leaf and soil water potential measurements from 3 years to investigate the species-specific capacity to utilize moisture from fog and dew within the Namib Desert. Eight common plant species in the Namib Desert were selected. Our results showed that both fog and dew significantly increased soil water potential. Seven of the eight plant species studied responded to fog and dew events, although the magnitude of the response differed. Plants generally showed stronger responses to fog than to dew. Fog timing seemed to be an important factor determining vegetation response; for example, night fog did not affect plant water potential. We also found that Euclea pseudebenus and Faidherbia albida likely exploit fog moisture through foliar uptake. This study provides a first comprehensive assessment of the effects of nonrainfall waters on plant water status within the Namib Desert. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of concurrent leaf and soil water potential measurements to identify the pathways of nonrainfall water use by desert vegetation. Our results fill a knowledge gap in dryland ecohydrology and have important implications for other drylands.

Can we condition native plants to increase drought tolerance and improve restoration success?	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												A common method in ecological restoration is the transplanting of nursery-grown seedlings to the field and, with proper resources, this technique can be highly successful. However, stressors such as drought may negatively impact plant performance and restoration success, especially in dryland ecosystems. Furthermore, increasing environmental change may hamper the ability of practitioners to restore native vegetation. A growing body of research suggests that exposing plants to a stressor may improve tolerance to subsequent stress events later in life. We sought to understand if such a phenomenon could be exploited in order to improve plant drought-tolerance and aid native plant restoration in southern California. In a multi-phase experiment, we first exposed seedlings of native perennials to episodic drought and then later compared the response of these plants to a second drought event to that of well-watered controls. We also transplanted replicates of both treatments to a restoration site in the field to test whether exposure to drought as a seedling could improve plant performance. Plant species responded to drought differently, with species exhibiting the full range of positive, neutral, and negative responses to temporal variability in water stress. However, some species appeared to benefit from drought preconditioning, exhibiting greater growth and increased water-use efficiency compared to well-watered plants. This suggests that simple applications of stress treatments could improve plant growth and stress tolerance, but the success of this method is likely very species specific. Restoration practitioners should consider conducting pilot studies with target plant species to better understand if this technique could assist in achieving restoration goals.																			1051-0761	1939-5582				APR	2019	29	3							e01863	10.1002/eap.1863	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.1863								30831005					WOS:000463954800012

Global monitoring of soil multifunctionality in drylands using satellite imagery and field data	REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Models derived from satellite image data are needed to monitor the status of terrestrial ecosystems across large spatial scales. However, a remote sensing-based approach to quantify soil multifunctionality at the global scale is missing despite significant research efforts on this topic. A major constraint for doing so is the availability of suitable global-scale field data to calibrate remote sensing indicators (RSI) and, to a lesser extent, the sensitivity of spectral data of available satellite sensors to soil background and atmospheric conditions. Here, we aimed to develop a soil multifunctionality model to monitor global drylands coupling ground data on 14 soil functions of 222 dryland areas from six continents to 18 RSI derived from a time series (2006-2013) Landsat dataset. Among the RSI evaluated, the chlorophyll absorption ratio index was the best predictor of soil multifunctionality in single-variable-based models (r = 0.66, P < 0.01, NMRSE = 0.17). However, a multi-variable RSI model combining the chlorophyll absorption ratio index, the global environment monitoring index and the canopy-air temperature difference improved the accuracy of quantifying soil multifunctionality (r = 0.73, P < 0.01, NMRSE = 0.15). Furthermore, the correlation between RSI and soil variables shows a wide range of accuracy with upper and lower values obtained for AMI (r = 0.889, NMRSE = 0.05) and BGL (r = 0.685, NMRSE = 0.18) respectively. Our results provide new insights on assessing soil multifunctionality using RSI that may help to monitor temporal changes in the functioning of global drylands effectively.

Relevance of Neglected and Underutilized Plants for Climate Change Adaptation & Conservation Implications in Semi-arid Regions of Tanzania	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Neglected and underutilized plant species (NUS) in Tanzania are maintained by socio-cultural preferences. However, a majority remains inadequately characterized and neglected by research and conservation initiatives. Over long time ago, the NUS have been part of the major component in the food systems of local communities especially in the dryland areas to overcome challenges brought about by uncertain climatic conditions. This study documents the NUS diversity and indigenous knowledge on their availability, agronomic and cultural practices in the Semi-arid zones of Tanzania to verify their economic potentials and promote their sustainable utilization for climate change adaptation as well as natural resources conservation. The study involved field plant identification, quantification and participatory rural appraisals (PRAs). The results indicate that the study regions have very rich diversity of NUS contributing significantly to the people's adaptation to drought conditions and food shortages in the areas. The NUS in the studied regions had varied uses including food and medicine. A majority of the consulted farmers in the study area indicated that the NUS utilized in the areas were either minimally cultivated on farms, freely obtained from the wild or grew as weeds in the farmlands. Despite the potentials for NUS in contributing to climate change adaptation in the areas, so far there have been no efforts geared towards their sustainable utilization and conservation. It is observed that promotion of NUS through improved packaging and marketing could contribute to the economy of the local people who have access to NUS in the area and therefore enhance resilience of semi-arid communities.

J	Schönfelder, T				Schoenfelder, Timm			Reinventing the Steppe: The <i>Agromeliorative Complex</i> in the Russian Periphery	SLAVIC REVIEW												For centuries, the steppe had served as a frontier and as a borderland to the Russian empire. In the 1930s, however, the semi-arid fields to the northeast of Stavropol became the object of intensified agricultural reclamation. Following the Central Asian example of dryland irrigation, the Soviet leadership dreamed of transforming the steppe biome into an oasis of high-modernist progress. Promises of plentiful yields fueled the planning of new hydro-infrastructures devised to counter the destructive forces of nature and to make the steppe bloom. Poverty, hunger, and natural disasters were to be threats of the past. As large swaths of land in the North Caucasus were re-imagined on the drawing boards of Soviet hydro-engineers, an agromeliorative complex evolved that favored large-scale solutions over locally adapted means. From 1965, this complex was represented by the Ministry of Melioration and Water Management (Minvodkhoz). It was supported by leading members of the nomenklatura like Nikita Khrushchev, Leonid Brezhnev, and Mikhail Gorbachev. However, their one-sided reclamation policies ignored ample warnings on soil erosion and agricultural degradation that were caused by excessive irrigation. As a result, yields declined whereas state investment continually increased. This paper shows how the vision to convert semi-arid lands into blossoming oases of progress created a path dependency with largely devastating consequences, as the hydro-engineers did not acknowledge the fragile ecosystem of the steppe. This reveals a deep and systemic sustainability crisis within Soviet agriculture that contributed to the economically fueled collapse of 1991.

Bruce; Zurlini, Giovanni			The Resilient Recurrent Behavior of Mediterranean Semi-Arid Complex Adaptive Landscapes	LAND												Growing external pressures from human activities and climate change can exacerbate desertification, compromising the livelihoods of more than 25% of the world's population. The dryland mosaic is defined by land covers that do not behave similarly, and the identification of their recurring or irregular changes over time is crucial, especially in areas susceptible to become desertified. To this aim, the methodological approach of this research is based on the integration of non-linear data analysis techniques, such as recurrence plots (RPs) and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), applied to the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which is a functional ecological proxy of above ground net primary production. The research exploits the recurring change detected in vegetation cover over time to gauge the predictable (resilient) behavior of the EVI as well as its chaoticity in a semi-arid Mediterranean region (Apulia, Italy). Interestingly, the results have shown the spatial rendering of recurrence variables, confirming the well-known hot spots of soil degradation and desertification taking place in the region, which are characterized by greater EVI chaoticity, but they have also identified new potential candidate sites. As a result, the susceptibility to land degradation, as measured by the EVI-RQA approach, can help in measuring land desertification with evident operational benefits for landscape planning. The novelty of the research lies in the spatially explicit identification of resilient and less resilient areas to desertification that can support the definition of more targeted interventions and conservation priorities for better planning and sustainable management of Mediterranean drylands.

This paper focuses on the spatiotemporal variability in the intra-annual persistence of soil moisture in China using the fifth-generation reanalysis dataset by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts for the period 1979-2018. The results show that in China, the mean intra-annual persistence in the humid to arid zones increased from 60 to 115 days in the lower layer but decreased from 19 to 13 days and from 25 to 14 days in the upper and root layers, respectively. However, these changes were strongly attenuated in extremely dry and wet regions due to the scarcity of soil moisture anomalies. Large changes in persistence occurred in the lower soil layer in dryland areas, with a mean difference of up to 40 days between the 2010s and the 1980s. Overall increasing trends dominated the large-scale spatial features, despite regional decreases in the eastern arid zone and the North and Northeast China plains. In the root layer, the two plains experienced an expanded decrease while on the Tibetan Plateau it was dominated by decadal variability. These contrasting changes between the lower and root layers along the periphery of the transition zone was a reflection of the enhanced soil hydrological cycle in the root layer. The enhanced persistence in drylands lower layer is an indication of the intensified impacts of soil moisture anomalies (e.g., droughts) on terrestrial water cycle. These findings may help the understanding of climate change impacts on terrestrial environments.					吕, 美霞/HKF-7986-2023; Li, 李明星 Mingxing/AAJ-6084-2020	吕, 美霞/0000-0002-4278-9551; Li, 李明星 Mingxing/0000-0002-1427-8092; Wu, Peili/0000-0001-7908-7062													0894-8755	1520-0442				NOV 15	2020	33	22					9531	9550		10.1175/JCLI-D-19-0900.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-19-0900.1													WOS:000589812200002

One lineage of climbers in the cactus family, the Hylocereus group of Selenicereus, includes several species that produce edible fruits and is currently cultivated around the world. Fruits are known as pitahayas, pitayas or dragon fruit. Here, by means of ecological niche-based modelling and analytical hierarchical modelling, the optimal areas for cultivating the three main species of this group in Mesoamerica - Selenicereus costaricensis, Selenicereus ocamponis and Selenicereus undatus - are identified. Data on distribution, physiological requirement and host preferences are taken into account to carry out ecological modelling for current and future scenarios of climate and determine its impact on cultivation. Two MIROC climatic future models, one optimistic (ssp216) and a pessimistic (ssp585) were selected and 554 records from Mexico and Central America were gathered. For all three species, temperature and precipitation seasonality, and solar radiation were the most significant variables in the niche modelling. In addition, for S. undatus the most important hosts, three species of mesquite legume trees were significant to forecast suitable areas for planting. Large areas on the Pacific side from Sinaloa to Costa Rica were predicted as favourable for cultivating the studied three species. Future scenarios of climate change predicted increase of suitable areas for two species and in particular for S. undatus the increment was the largest. Therefore, dragon fruits are corroborated as promising fruits in view of climate change.

Long-distance gene flow in <i>Acacia senegal:</i> Hope for disturbed and fragmented populations	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Even though pollen and seed dispersals are some of the important factors that determine tree species survival across landscapes, gene dispersal data of important tropical dryland tree species such as Acacia senegal that are undergoing various population disturbances remain scarce. Understanding patterns of gene dispersal in these ecosystems is important for conservation, landscape restoration and tree improvement. We investigated pollen and seed mediated gene flow in two A. senegal populations of contrasting state (less disturbed and heavily undisturbed) using nine microsatellites and 128 genotyping-by-sequencing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) multilocus genotypes of two growth stages (juvenile and adult trees) and their spatial locations. We performed parentage assignments using likelihood approach and undertook spatial genetic structure (SGS) analyses for the two growth stages through correlation among kinship coefficients and geographical distances between pair of individuals. The SNPs showed higher resolving power and assignment rates than microsatellites; however, a combination of the two marker-types improved the assignment rate and provided robust parentage assessments. We found evidence of long-distance (up to 210 m) pollination events for both populations; however, the majority of seed dispersal was found closer to the putative maternal parent. On average, parentage analysis showed high amounts of pollen (40%) and seed (20%) immigration in both populations. Significant positive SGS was found only for the adult cohorts in the less disturbed population for distance classes 20 and 40 m, indicating historical short-distance seed dispersals. Our results suggest long-distance gene flow within the species and we recommend conservation of remnant and isolated populations or individual trees to promote genetic connectivity.																			2045-7758					JUL	2023	13	7							e10292	10.1002/ece3.10292	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.10292								37449018					WOS:001028935200001

Economic Injury Levels and Dynamic Action Thresholds for <i>Diuraphis noxia</i> (Hemiptera: Aphididae) in Australian Cereal Crops	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												The Russian wheat aphid (Diuraphis noxia [Kurdjumov, Hemiptera: Aphididae], RWA) was first detected in Australia in 2016 and is threatening an annual cereal industry valued at nearly 10 billion AUD per annum. Considerable uncertainty surrounds the economic risk of D. noxia to Australian cereals, which limits cost-effective farm management decisions. Through a series of inoculated and non-inoculated field trials in 2018 and 2019 in south-eastern Australia, we generated a range of D. noxia pressure metrics under different growing conditions for barley, wheat, and durum wheat. Relative yield loss was best explained by the 'percentage of tillers with D. noxia' (%TwRWA) with 0.28% yield loss per percent of tillers with D. noxia, which is significantly lower than 0.46-0.48% for susceptible winter wheat varieties in dryland conditions in the United States. Highest infestation levels were typically reached around GS40-50. To develop an action threshold, we calculated the rate of increase in the %TwRWA through time at 0.021% per day per %TwRWA (with little variation across sites). This allowed prediction of the expected maximum %TwRWA based on observations post tillering (GS30) and the expected duration before GS50 is reached. For earlier growth stages (<GS30), we were unable to determine yield impact and action thresholds since cereal plants produce many new tillers between GS20 and GS30, which may compensate for feeding damage as reported in other studies. This research should improve the cost-effectiveness of management decisions involving D. noxia in Australian cereal production systems.

Physiological and carbohydrate metabolism traits for discrimination of drought-tolerant elite ecotypes of <i>Argania spinosa</i>	PLANT PHYSIOLOGY REPORTS												Argan (Argania spinosa) tree is a horticultural-forestry species characterized by its endemicity and its adaptive behavior to arid and semi-arid environments in the southwest of Morocco. It plays meaningful ecological, economic and social roles. Argan oil has high nutritional and dietetic values; it is thought to be one of the vegetable oils with the highest quality in the world. To characterize and to identify the most drought-tolerant ecotypes of the Argan tree, we focused our work on certain drought tolerance traits by studying the change in stomatal conductance (g(s)), Rubisco activity, carbohydrate compounds and enzymes in four different Argan ecotypes. These Argan ecotypes were grown under drought stress for 2 months. Under severe drought conditions, we recorded significant reduction in g(s) and Rubisco activity, the largest decrease was noted in the both contrasting coastal ecotypes. However, drought stress significantly increased the hexoses concentration in stressed plant leaves indicating stimulation of activity of carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes. The correlations obtained suggest that related enzymes of primary carbohydrate metabolism have highly important effects on foliar hexoses concentration in Argania spinosa during drought stress. Based on canonical discriminant analysis, both contrasting coastal ecotypes were distinctly separated from both contrasting inland ecotypes by the traits showing the high discriminatory potential: Rubisco, aldose 6-phosphate reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and g(s). These traits can be efficiently exploited to identify superior ecotypes suitable for drought conditions. Inland ecotypes appear to be more drought tolerants and interesting for regeneration of Argan tree in dryland areas.

J	Wang, ZW; Huang, LM; Shao, MA				Wang, Ziwei; Huang, Laiming; Shao, Ming 'an			Spatial variations and influencing factors of soil organic carbon under different land use types in the alpine region of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau	CATENA												Understanding soil organic carbon (SOC) distribution and influencing factors are important to accurately assess soil carbon sink potential and ecosystem quality. However, variations and controls of SOC content and stock under various land use types in the alpine region of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau remain challenging. In this study, soil properties (pH, bulk density, porosity, clay content, soil organic carbon, soil water content, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, available nitrogen and available phosphorus) and environmental parameters (annual average temperature, annual average rainfall, normalized differential vegetation index, altitude, slope, surface rough-ness, longitude and latitude) were determined across a 600 km east-west transect in the Tibet alpine region for investigating the distribution characteristics and controls of SOC for three land use patterns - farmland (FA), forestland (FO) and grassland (GR). Results indicated that SOC content in the 0-30 cm decreased with increasing soil depth at different reduction rates under various land use types. The average SOC content and stock in GR was significantly higher than that in FO and FA due to the existence of mattic epipdon in GR under high altitude. The non-consideration of gravel content in soil can lead to an overestimation of SOC stock of 0-30 cm soil layer by 15.37 %, 16.70 % and 17.43 % for FA, FO and GR, respectively. Soil properties and environmental conditions simultaneously affect the spatial distribution of SOC under various land use patterns. Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) using multiple regression were used to forecast SOC content in the studied alpine region, which had a better predictive performance than previous published PTFs in the plain area, especially when SOC contents were higher than 40 g kg-1. Our study provides a foundation to build SOC prediction models for other alpine regions in the world, where SOC contents generally exhibit a wider range than the plain areas.

To better understand the improvement of sand soil quality and the limitation of soil nutrients after adding feldspathic sandstone, we investigated changes in soil microbial activity after 10 months of mixing feldspathic sandstone and sand, and compared the dynamics with soil properties. We used fumigation extraction to determine soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC), nitrogen (MBN), phosphorus (MBP), and microplate fluorometric techniques to measure soil beta -1,4-glucosidase (BG), beta -1,4-xylosidase (BX), beta -D-cellobiohydrolase (CBH), N-acetyl-beta -glucosaminidase (NAG), and Alkaline phosphatase (AKP). We also measured soil organic carbon (SOC), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), soil inorganic carbon (SIC), and soil water content (SWC). Our results showed that the soil microbial biomass C, N, P, and individual extracellular enzyme activities significantly increased in mixed soil. Similarly, the soil microbial biomass C:N, C:P, N:P, MBC:SOC, and BG:NAG significantly increased by 54.3%, 106.3%, 33.1%, 23.0%, and 65.4%, respectively. However, BG:AKP and NAG:AKP decreased by 19.0% and 50.3%, respectively. Additionally, redundancy analysis (RDA) and Pearson's correlation analysis showed that SWC, SOC, porosity and field capacity were significantly associated with soil microbial biomass indices (i.e., C, N, P, C:N, C:P, N:P in microbial biomass, and MBC:SOC) and extracellular enzyme activity metrics (i.e., individual enzyme activity, ecoenzymatic stoichiometry, and vector characteristics of enzyme activity), while pH, EC, and SIC had no correlation with these indices and metrics. These results indicated that mixing feldspathic sandstone and sand is highly susceptible to changes in soil microbial activity, and the soil N limitation decreased while P became more limited. In summary, our research showed that adding feldspathic sandstone into sand can significantly improve soil quality and provide a theoretical basis for the development of desertified land resources.

Effects of maternal and grandmaternal flea infestation on offspring quality and quantity in a desert rodent: evidence for parasite-mediated transgenerational phenotypic plasticity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY												Parasites can cause a broad range of sublethal fitness effects across a wide variety of host taxa. However, a host's efforts to compensate for possible parasite-induced fitness effects are less well-known. Parental effects may beneficially alter the offspring phenotype if parental environments sufficiently predict the offspring environment. Parasitism is a common stressor across generations; therefore, parental infestation could reliably predict the likelihood of infestation for offspring. However, little is known about relationships between parasitism and transgenerational phenotypic plasticity. Thus, we investigated how maternal and grandmaternal infestation with fleas (Xenopsylla ramesis) affected offspring quality and quantity in a desert rodent (Meriones crassus). We used a fully-crossed design with control and infested treatments to examine litter size, pup body mass at birth, and pup mass gain before weaning for combinations of maternal and grandmaternal infestation status. No effect of treatment on litter size or pup body mass at birth was found. However, maternal and grandmaternal infestation status significantly affected pre-weaning body mass gain, a proxy for the rate of maturation, in male pups. Pups gained significantly more weight before weaning if maternal and grandmaternal infestation statuses matched, regardless of the treatment. Thus, pups whose mothers and grandmothers experienced similar risks of parasitism, either both non-parasitized or both infested, would reach sexual maturity more quickly than those pups whose mothers' infestation status did not match that of their grandmothers. These results support the contention that parents can receive external cues such as the risk of parasitism, that prompt them to alter offspring provisioning.

Significant genotype, environment and genotype x environment interaction effects suggested role of environment in development and spread of the disease. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis using QTL Cartographer identified a total of 14 QTL for six traits of which five QTL were for disease incidence. One quantitative trait locus q60DI located on LG_AhII was identified using both QTL Cartographer and QTL Network. Another QTL q90DI was detected with a high PVE of 12.57 using QTL Cartographer. A total of nine significant additive x additive (AA) interactions were detected for PBND disease incidence and yield traits with two and seven interactions displaying effects in favour of the parental and recombinant genotype combinations, respectively. This is the first attempt on QTL discovery associated with PBND resistance in peanut. Superior RILs identified in the study can be recycled or released as variety following further evaluations.					yaduru, Shasidhar/HLW-8252-2023; Pandey, Manish/JPL-3773-2023; Kona, Praveen/JEP-3410-2023; Varshney, Rajeev K/C-5295-2014	yaduru, Shasidhar/0000-0002-8520-578X; Varshney, Rajeev K/0000-0002-4562-9131; KONA, PRAVEEN/0000-0003-2758-1848; Sunkad, Gururaj/0000-0003-1138-9683													0179-9541	1439-0523				DEC	2019	138	6					748	760		10.1111/pbr.12743	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbr.12743		SEP 2019											WOS:000486756700001

We implemented a nutrient omission experiment to assess the effect of nutrient application on maize yield and nutritional balance. Maize ear leaves were analyzed for nutrients, to identify nutrient balance status using the Diagnostic and Recommendation Integrated System (DRIS) approach. Results indicated that omission of N or P resulted in highly imbalanced DRIS indices respectively, and significantly lower grain yield. A strong inverse relationship between K ear leaf content with DRIS index suggests that K application negatively increases K imbalance in many situations. Imbalances of Mg, Ca and Cu were more associated with higher yielding treatments. A Which-Won-Where result show that nutrient imbalances in the diagnosis were systematically frequent when N was omitted. All the diagnosed nutrients were imbalanced even under the highest yielding NPKZn treatment; indicating further opportunity for yield increase with more balanced nutrition. Balanced nutrition of maize in the maize belt of Nigeria should target application of varying rates of N, P, K, Mg, S and Zn, depending on the soil conditions. But, because of complexities of nutrient interactions during uptake, it is hardly possible to realize a balanced nutrition. However, differentiating the application of antagonistic nutrients into foliar or soil-based methods is recommended for a more balanced maize nutrition.

Quantifying the rill shape is crucial for studying the mechanisms and evolution of rill erosion. The objective of this study is to monitor the dynamic process of slope rill erosion using on a digital close range photogrammetry observation system during continuous rainfall. Artificial simulated rainfall experiments were conducted, and images were obtained at different time intervals. We used hydrological analysis and profile analysis tools in geographic information system (GIS) technology to extract rill networks and their main parameters to quantitatively describe the erosion processes of rill morphology. The results showed that (1) compared with the error from the traditional runoff sediment measurement method, the average error of the system for estimating soil loss was -7.06% and 1.05%, respectively, and the highest precision for a single observation was 99.46%; (2) the rill erosion process could be divided into several stages: raindrop splashing - eclipse - drop pit - erosion cave - rill cutting head - rill erosion - rill network; and (3) after rainfall lasted for 80 min, the density and the degree of splitting increased continuously, and the maximum rill width and depth both showed fluctuating trends. The area of 7.5 m to 9.5 m away from the top of the surface was the most active area of rill erosion. The digital close range photogrammetric observation system can accurately obtain evolution information about rill erosion morphology during continuous rainfall, which provides a reference for future studies of soil erosion processes.

J	Jin, K; Jin, YS; Wang, F; Zong, QL				Jin, Kai; Jin, Yansong; Wang, Fei; Zong, Quanli			Should time-lag and time-accumulation effects of climate be considered in attribution of vegetation dynamics? Case study of China's temperate grassland region	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY												Although the time-lag and time-accumulation effects (TLTAEs) of climatic factors on vegetation growth have been investigated extensively, the uncertainties caused by disregarding TLTAEs in the attribution analysis of long-term changes in vegetation remain unclear. This hinders our understanding of the associated changes in ecosystems and the effects of climate change. In this study, using multiple methods, we evaluate the biases of attribution analyses of vegetation dynamics caused by the non-consideration of TLTAEs in the temperate grassland region (TGR) of China from 2000 to 2019. Based on the datasets of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), temperature (TMP), precipitation (PRE), and solar radiation (SR), the temporal reaction patterns of vegetation are analyzed, and the relationships among these variables under two scenarios (considering and disregarding TLTAEs) are compared. The results indicate that most areas of the TGR show a greening trend. A time-lag or time-accumulation effect of the three climatic variables is observed in most areas with significant spatial differences. The lagged times of the vegetation response to PRE are particularly prominent, with an average of 2.12 months in the TGR. When the TLTAE is considered, the areas where changes in the NDVI are affected by climatic factors expanded significantly, whereas the explanatory power of climate change on NDVI change increased by an average of 9.3% in the TGR; these improvements are more prominent in relatively arid areas. This study highlights the importance of including TLTAEs in the attribution of vegetation dynamics and the assessment of climatic effects on ecosystems.																			0020-7128	1432-1254				JUL	2023	67	7					1213	1223		10.1007/s00484-023-02489-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-023-02489-1		JUN 2023						37322247					WOS:001008439100001
J	Shen, Q; Ma, Y				Shen, Qin; Ma, Ying			Did water diversion projects lead to sustainable ecological restoration in arid endorheic basins? Lessons from long-term changes of multiple ecosystem indicators in the lower Heihe River Basin	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Ecological water diversion projects (EWDPs) are crucial for dryland ecosystem restoration in arid endorheic basins. Comprehensive and in-depth evaluations of ecological effects and especially the potential risks of EWDPs on long-term ecosystem changes were limited in previous studies. In this study, spatio-temporal variations in multiple indicators (land use/cover, landscape pattern and vegetation cover) derived from Landsat images were integrated to detect ecosystem changes from 1990 to 2015 in the lower Heihe River Basin (HRB), China, where an EWDP was conducted by the Chinese government in 2000. The results showed that the EWDP prevented ecological degradation and effectively restored the arid oasis ecosystem. From 2000 to 2010, the transformation from unused land to natural vegetation and wetlands, was the major land use/cover change; the degree of landscape fragmentation decreased, and the regional normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) increased significantly. However, the EWDP did not restore the ecosystem to the status in 1990, and some vegetation degradation occurred after 2010, with approximately 38% of the study area showing significant decrease in NDVI. Human interventions, especially overexpansion of cultivated oases, which restricted ecological water use, and construction of artificial canals, which reduced groundwater recharge, resulted in the browning trend from 2010 to 2015. Therefore, the EWDPs did not definitely lead to sustainable ecological restoration and ecosystem development. The quantification results can provide significant implications for water resources management and ecosystem planning to prevent ecological degradation in the study area. The multi-indicator method with long-term and high-resolution dataset used here can be adapted to other arid regions for comprehensively evaluating the ecological restoration ability of the EWDP.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a training program on the self-efficacy and knowledge of peer leaders with type 2 diabetes. Methods A single-group longitudinal survey with baseline, intervention, and follow-up periods was conducted at a diabetes clinic in a small municipality in Metro Manila, Philippines. The intervention, a self-efficacy theory-based training program for peer-leaders of diabetic patients conducted in August 2017, comprised hands-on learning, demonstrations, quizzes, roleplaying, group sharing, physical exercise, and a buffet lunch. The primary outcome was participants' self-efficacy for management of their diabetes. Secondary outcomes were participants' knowledge of diabetes and levels of emotional distress, motivation, and confidence for guiding their peers, satisfaction with the training program, hemoglobin A1c, and quality of life. Results At 12 and 18 months after the intervention, participants' knowledge of diabetes was significantly increased compared with baseline (both P < 0.05). At earlier time points, an increasing, but not significant, trend was observed. The change in knowledge of diabetes from baseline to 18 months after intervention tended to be positively correlated with the change in self-efficacy (r = 0.594, P = 0.054). No significant differences were observed for any of the other outcomes, although the descriptive statistics showed an increasing trend for all of the outcomes except motivation. Conclusion The training program significantly improved participants' knowledge of diabetes at 12 and 18 months after the training programs compared with baseline. A positive correlation between the changes in the levels of knowledge and self-efficacy suggested that the observed improvement of self-efficacy was facilitated by the improvement of knowledge of diabetes.

Identification of genomic regions linked to blast (<i>Pyricularia grisea</i>) resistance in pearl millet	PLANT BREEDING												Blast disease causes serious economic yield losses in pearl millet. Identification and introgression of genomic regions associated with blast resistance can help to develop resistant cultivars to minimize yield losses incurred from blast outbreaks. In this study, 384 advanced pearl millet genotypes were screened against six blast pathotype-isolates (major pearl millet growing agro-ecologies of India), namely, Pg 45, Pg 118, Pg 138, Pg 186, Pg 204 and Pg 232. Analysis of variance showed significant (P < .001) variation among genotypes for blast reaction (susceptible to resistance). ICMR 08111 and ICMR 10888 genotypes showed resistance to all six blast pathotypes. A genome-wide association study performed with 264,241 single nucleotide polymorphic markers could successfully identify 15 SNPs (P = 1.26 x 10(-7) to 9.22 x 10(-12)) underlying the genomic regions governing blast-resistance across five different chromosomes. The SNPs reported had a significant association in at least two of the three models tested (GLM, MLM and Farm CPU). These SNPs can be used in pearl millet-resistant breeding programmes after their function has been validated across different genetic backgrounds.																			0179-9541	1439-0523				AUG	2023	142	4					506	517		10.1111/pbr.13111	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbr.13111		MAY 2023											WOS:000991451200001
J	Zhu, GY; Shangguan, ZP; Lei, D				Zhu, Guangyu; Shangguan, Zhouping; Lei Deng			Dynamics of water-stable aggregates associated organic carbon assessed from delta C-13 changes following temperate natural forest development in China	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												In the context of global climate change, the preservation of soil productivity and the estimation of carbon budgets and cycles, the quantification of changes in carbon has important significance. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of soil aggregate associated organic carbon (OC) following temperate natural forest development in China. The objectives of this study were to examine the variation of soil aggregate associated OC decomposition rates, quantify the changes in the proportion of new and old soil aggregate OC, and explore the effects of controlling factors on SOC stocks, rate of total SOC increase and decomposition rate constants. The results showed that soil aggregate associated OC sequestration increased in 0-10 cm soil depth, while decreased in 10-30 cm soil depth. However, rate of aggregate associated OC increase, decomposition rate constants, and proportion of new OC increased at the early stage and then decreased along with the natural vegetation restoration. In addition, land use change had an important effect on soil aggregate associated OC dynamics, and soil particles, BD, MWD, C: N, plant diversity also played an important role. Moreover, SOC stocks had a negative relationship with clay and silt, while had a positive relationship with MWD and sandy soils. decomposition rate constants had a negative relationship with plant diversity, silt, and sand, while had a positive relationship with C: N and MWD. The proportions of new SOC had significant positive relationships with C: N, and it had a negative relationship with clay and silt. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the formation mechanism of soil particles and aggregates, improve plant biodiversity, regulate the soil C: N ratio, and improve soil particle structure to increase soil carbon sequestration.					朱, 广宇/GQZ-5189-2022	ZHU, GUANGYU/0000-0002-8641-2422													0167-1987	1879-3444				JAN	2021	205								104782	10.1016/j.still.2020.104782	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2020.104782													WOS:000582696400027

This study described the design, calibration, and practical application of an instrumented technique that automatically characterized surface flow in situ fields. The instrument consisted of a sampling assembly, a measuring assembly, and a management platform. The special design combined with a volume-mass conversion relationship was used to determine the exact volume and mass of the sediment-laden water, thereby allowing the implementation of real-time measurement and synchronous calculation of runoff rate and sediment concentration. Calibration results showed that normal distributions and an average error of -3.67% were obtained for the target sediment concentrations of 2-1,000 g/L. Compared with the gravimetric method, the average error of the new technique for sediment concentration was 4.82%, and the highest precision was 98.50%. The high repeatability and accuracy of the technique suggest that it can be used with confidence to give satisfactory results in fields. A field experiment under natural rainfall showed that a grass-covered plot had 18.94% less runoff rate and 42.92% lower sediment concentration than a bare soil plot, illustrating the impact of vegetation cover on reducing soil loss. This uniquely designed instrument provides a new approach to real-time sediment detection in surface flow. It will be beneficial for rigorously evaluating runoff and sedimentation and for in-depth research regarding water and soil loss processes.

Nutrient Acquisition, Rather Than Stress Response Over Diel Cycles, Drives Microbial Transcription in a Hyper-Arid Namib Desert Soil	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Hot desert surface soils are characterized by extremely low water activities for large parts of any annual cycle. It is widely assumed that microbial processes in such soils are very limited. Here we present the first metatranscriptomic survey of microbial community function in a low water activity hyperarid desert soil. Sequencing of total mRNA revealed a diverse and active community, dominated by Actinobacteria. Metatranscriptomic analysis of samples taken at different times over 3 days indicated that functional diel variations were limited at the whole community level, and mostly affected the eukaryotic subpopulation which was induced during the cooler night hours. High levels of transcription of chemoautotrophic carbon fixation genes contrasted with limited expression of photosynthetic genes, indicating that chemoautotrophy is an important alternative to photosynthesis for carbon cycling in desiccated desert soils. Analysis of the transcriptional levels of key N-cycling genes provided strong evidence that soil nitrate was the dominant nitrogen input source. Transcriptional network analyses and taxon-resolved functional profiling suggested that nutrient acquisition processes, and not diurnal environmental variation, were the main drivers of community activity in hyperarid Namib Desert soil. While we also observed significant levels of expression of common stress response genes, these genes were not dominant hubs in the co-occurrence network.

Chickpea varieties with improved nutrient content contribute towards reducing malnutrition resulting from protein and micronutrient deficiency. The current study evaluated a diverse chickpea reference set of 280 accessions for grain protein, Fe and Zn contents traits to understand the genetic nature of these traits in relation to grain yield and other yield contributing traits for two years under normal crop season. Analysis of variance revealed highly significant differences among the accessions for grain nutrients and agronomic traits. Large variability for grain protein (16.3-26.2%), Fe (44.1-76.7 mg kg(-1)) and Zn (36.3-56.2 mg kg(-1)) contents were observed. The high heritability estimates (85-98%) were observed for the quality traits, and these traits showed significantly negative correlation with grain yield. In the cluster analysis, cluster II showed higher cluster means for grain Fe and Zn (66.6 and 51.1 mg kg -1). The promising accessions with high protein, Fe and Zn contents identified in the study can be used as potential donors for global breeding programmes to develop nutrient-dense chickpea cultivars.

J	Wang, JM; He, NAP; Wang, Y; Li, JW; Li, MX				Wang, Jianming; He, Nianpeng; Wang, Yin; Li, Jingwen; Li, Mingxu			Divergent drivers determine soil bacterial β-diversity of forest and grassland ecosystems in Northwest China	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												The determinants of bacterial beta-diversity across the large scale have been well explored, yet little is known that about how the driving factors of bacterial beta-diversity differ between the forest and grassland in northwest China. Here, we comprehensively compared the biogeographic patterns and their drivers of bacterial communities in the forest and grassland. We also quantified the relative contribution of two components (replacement and nestedness components) to bacterial beta-diversity. We found the significant distance-decay relationships in both two ecosystems, whereas more species turnover correlating with geographic distance was observed in forest ecosystems than grassland ecosystem, and the slope in the forest was significantly steeper than that in grassland. This suggests that bacterial diversity in forest and grassland soil exhibits distinct biogeographic and ecological patterns. More importantly, we found that soil bacterial beta-diversity was mainly derived from replacement components in both two ecosystems, implying high proportion of endemic bacterial species distribute in dryland forest and grassland soil. Our results further demonstrated that environmental filtering have dominant effect on soil bacterial beta-diversity in both forest and grassland. However, the relative roles of spatial processes varied between forest and grassland, where stochastic processes only have significant influence on soil bacterial beta-diversity in forest but not in grassland. Among environmental factors, bacterial beta-diversity and turnover components was mainly determined by water availability in grassland soil, but by soil pH in the forest soil. Taken together, our findings collectively suggest that differential ecological drivers underlie distinct biogeographic patterns of bacterial diversity in forest and grassland soil.

J	Baldarelli, LM; Collins, SL; Ward, D				Baldarelli, Lauren M.; Collins, Scott L.; Ward, David			How encroaching shrubs and nutrients affect N<sub>2</sub>-fixation in the Chihuahuan desert	PLANT AND SOIL												Background and aims Organisms that are capable of nitrogen (N) fixation, such as some species of cyanobacteria in biological soil crusts (biocrusts), can be ecologically important especially in low-nutrient dryland ecosystems. In addition, woody plant encroachment is occurring in drylands globally, including many species of N-2-fixing shrubs and trees. We determined the effects of nutrient deposition and shrub encroachment by Larrea tridentata on N-2-fixation rates of biocrusts and compared these rates to another encroaching shrub, the N-2-fixer Prosopis glandulosa in the northern Chihuahuan Desert. Methods We used both the acetylene reduction assay (ARA) and the N-15 natural abundance techniques to determine N-2-fixation rates of biocrusts. We also assessed the effects of nutrient additions on biocrust N-2-fixation rates using a long-term N addition experiment started in 2008 that is part of the Nutrient Network (NutNet). Results There was no correlation between the ARA and delta N-15 methods. We found that P. glandulosa likely fixes more N (at least during the spring) than biocrusts based on delta N-15 content in roots. There was no significant difference in delta N-15 between P. glandulosa and our reference plant, L. tridentata. delta N-15 declined in N-fertilized plots presumably because biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is costly or because added N has negative effects on microbial communities. Conclusions Biocrusts fixed less nitrogen than N-2-fixing legume shrubs during this sampling period. Nonetheless, biocrusts are still a significant contributor to N-2-fixation in these nutrient-poor drylands based on the large proportion of soil surface area occupied by these organisms.																			0032-079X	1573-5036				SEP	2021	466	1-2					545	556		10.1007/s11104-021-05072-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-021-05072-y		JUL 2021											WOS:000673394100001

There is accumulating evidence for the mechanisms underlying NH4+-tolerance in rice and Arabidopsis, but similar knowledge for dryland crops is currently limited. We investigated the responses of a natural population of allotetraploid rapeseed to NH4+ and nitrate (NO3-) and screened one NH4+-tolerant genotype (T5) and one NH4+-sensitive genotype (S211). Determination of the shoot and root NH4+ concentrations showed that levels were higher in S211 than in T5. (NH4+)-N-15 uptake assays, glutamine synthetase (GS) activity quantification, and relative gene transcriptional analysis indicated that the significantly higher GS activity observed in T5 roots than that in S211 was the main reason for its NH4+-tolerance. In-depth metabolomic analysis verified that Gln metabolism plays an important role in rapeseed NH4+-tolerance. Furthermore, adaptive changes in carbon metabolism were much more active in T5 shoots than in S211. Interestingly, we found that N-glycosylation pathway was significantly induced by NH4+, especially the mannose metabolism, which concentration was 2.75-fold higher in T5 shoots than in S211 with NH4+ treatment, indicating that mannose may be a metabolomic marker which also confers physiological adaptations for NH4+ tolerance in rapeseed. The corresponding amino acid and soluble sugar concentrations and gene expression in T5 and S211 were consistent with these results. Genomic sequencing identified variations in the GLN (encoding GS) and GMP1 (encoding the enzyme that provides GDP-mannose) gene families between the T5 and S211 lines. These genes will be utilized as candidate genes for future investigations of the molecular mechanisms underlying NH4+ tolerance in rapeseed.

J	Zhang, QW; Wang, H; Wang, J				Zhang, Qing-wei; Wang, Hao; Wang, Jian			Biocrusts and subshrub development and soil water through a slope-gully system in a vegetation-restored site on the Loess Plateau of China	CATENA												The landscape position (LP) of slope-gully system (SGS) greatly influences the variations in soil water content, and development of biocrusts and vegetation. It is unclear the relationships between biocrusts, natural successional vegetation, and soil water content in the SGS with different LPs and habitats in semiarid regions. Therefore, this study aimed to clarify the relationships between moss-dominated biocrusts and natural successional A. sacrorum in the utilization of soil water; and investigate their spatial variation characteristics in a typical SGS. Soil water content in the 0-1 m soil layer, and biocrust and vegetation characteristics were measured at the summit, ridge slope, gully slope, and gully floor of an SGS in five habitats (i.e., bare areas (BA), mossdominated biocrusts (BC), A. sacrorum (AS), A. sacrorum with biocrusts (ASB), and dead A. sacrorum with biocrusts (DASB)). The results showed that plant aboveground biomass and soil water content in the 0-1 m soil layer followed the pattern of DASB < ASB < AS and BC < DASBC approximate to ASB < BA <= AS for the summit, and ridge and gully slopes, respectively. While, those followed the pattern of DASB < ASB approximate to AS and BC < DASBC approximate to ASB approximate to BA approximate to AS for the gully floor, respectively. Compared to bare lands, soil water content and aboveground biomass were lower in habitats covered by biocrusts, which was likely related to reduced infiltration of biocrusts. This phenomenon was insignificant at the gully floor, which was attributed to the decreasing effect of biocrusts on soil water content with the improvement of water conditions. Soil water content of subshrub covered habitats were slightly higher than those of bare lands, which probably related to the reduced soil evaporation under shading conditions. This study showed that the relationships between biocrusts, subshrubs, and soil water were complex under natural succession conditions, and further observations are needed in the future in semiarid regions.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				SEP	2022	216		A						106344	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106344	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106344		MAY 2022											WOS:000830974500001

This knowledge gap precludes our mechanistic understanding of soil biogeochemical cycles at large spatial scales. Herein we compared the contents and stoichiometric ratios of OC and nutrients in both bulk soils and aggregates in cropland and woodland across a clay content gradient (7-31%) in the Loess Plateau. The soil metrics that were measured included the proportions of water-stable aggregates, and the contents of OC, nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) in bulk soils and each aggregate fraction. The stoichiometric ratios of carbon (C), N and P were calculated. The relationships between soil metrics and clay content were analyzed. We hypothesize that OC, N and P in aggregates increase with day content, and these relationships are independent of land use types. In partial support of these hypotheses, the proportion of macroaggregates and the contents of OC, N and P in bulk soils and most aggregate fractions linearly increased with clay content. The slopes of these linear relationships were not affected by land use type. The C/N ratio were minimally affected, while the C/P and N/P ratios in both bulk soils and aggregates increased with clay content, and these relationships changed with land use type. Proportion of macroaggregates, contents of OC and N, and ratios of C/N, C/P and N/P were significantly higher in woodland than in cropland across or within sites. Furthermore, the distribution patterns of OC, N and P contents, and C/P and N/P ratios among aggregates varied with site and land use type. These suggested that soil texture determines the distribution of OC, N and P and their stoichiometric ratios within soil aggregates in the Loess Plateau of China, and most of these determining relationships were independent from land use types.

We selected a typical coarse sandy catchment on the Loess Plateau to investigate the changes of the runoff-sediment relationships with a data set of 62 years. A change point occurred in 1979, dividing the runoff and sediment load series into a baseline period (1954-1979) and a changing period (1980-2015). A total of 342 flood events were classified into three regimes using hierarchical clustering method. Regime A (162 events) was characterized by the shortest duration, lowest flood crest, and the least flow depth. Regime B (165 events) was characterized by a medium runoff depth, medium flow variability, and medium duration. Regime C merely include fifteen events with longest flood duration, the highest runoff depth, and the largest peak discharge. The sediment yield of flood regime A, B, and C accounted 14.2 % (1.09x10(8) t), 51.8 % (3.99x10(8) t), and 34.0 % (2.62x10(8) t) of the total sediment yield, respectively. The Support vector machines method was applied to established models to predict event sediment yield. It is demonstrated that the performance of models are good for different flood regimes.

However, its uses in biological control require a better understanding of its biology and the development of a cost-effective mass production. We firstly determined how T. remus reacts to an increasing S. frugiperda egg density. Subsequently we identified its preference for parasitism as a function of S. frugiperda egg age. Finally, we assessed the acceptability of Spodoptera littoralis as a factitious host for T. remus rearing. The number of eggs parasitized by T. remus increased as the egg density increased. Competition between T. remus females resulted in a male-biased sex ratio. Regarding host-eggs age, T. remus females prefer 1-day-old eggs over 2-or 3-day-old eggs. With respect to host acceptability, T. remus was shown to parasitize S. littoralis eggs and produce viable offspring. Although, T. remus tended to parasitize fewer S. littoralis than S. frugiperda eggs it can be used as a factitious host for the mass multiplication of T. remus in a biological control program.

(RFRW) rotation can be a resource-saving solution for sustainable cropping systems. However, conventional puddled and flood transplanted rice, repeat tractor compaction, and years of shallow rotary tillage and paddy-dryland rotation had a negative impact on soil physical in the RFRW rotation (e.g., soil consolidation and shrinkage, shallow tillage layer). A 4-yr field experiment was established to determine if different post-paddy tillage systems would improve soil physical properties and plant factors. We compared no-tillage (NT), conventional rotary tillage (RT), and deep tillage (DT) to improve the deteriorated soil structure, soil water, wheat root system, and grain yield. The results indicated that DT increased the average soil water content by 7.25% and 9.98%, increased field capacity by 9.58 and 5.23%, and decreased the soil bulk density by 6.2 and 2.2% at 0-to-20-cm soil depth in 4 yr as compared to NT and RT, respectively. The NT increased the average relative soil moisture and had higher soil bulk density at 0-to-20-cm depth. The DT deepened the root growth and increased the total root point numbers by 21.0 and 22.8% at 0-to-40-cm soil depth in 4 yr, respectively, compared with NT and RT. In 4 yr, the DT significantly achieved higher average grain yield by 5.3 and 13.5%, respectively, compared with NT and RT. Overall, DT after rice was shown to be a promising management approach for improving wheat yields and might enable sustainable intensification of RFRW rotation.																			0361-5995	1435-0661				JAN	2023	87	1					30	42		10.1002/saj2.20486	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/saj2.20486		DEC 2022											WOS:000894180500001
J	Leng, XJ; Feng, XM; Fu, BJ; Zhang, Y				Leng, Xuejing; Feng, Xiaoming; Fu, Bojie; Zhang, Yu			The Spatiotemporal Change of Glacier Runoff Is Comparably Attributed to Climatic Factors and Physical Properties in Northwestern China	REMOTE SENSING												The spatiotemporal regimes of glacier runoff (GR) under a warming climate are of great concern, especially in dryland areas in northwestern China (DAC). Due to the difficulty of observing GR, little attention has been given to the spatiotemporal change in GR at regional scales. This study uses the regional individual glacier mass balance (GMB) dataset developed by digital elevation models (DEMs) to simulate the spatiotemporal regime of GR using atmospheric parameters considering both ablation and accumulation processes on glaciers. In this study, GR, including glacier meltwater runoff (MR) and delayed water runoff (DR) of the DAC, was quantitatively assessed at a catchment scale from 1961 to 2015. The total annual GR in the DAC was (100.81 +/- 68.71) x 10(8) m(3) in 1961-2015, where MR accounted for 68%. Most basins had continuously increasing tendencies of different magnitudes from 1961 to 2015. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and random forest techniques were used to explore the contributions of climate factors and glacier physical properties to GR, and the results indicated that climate factors could explain 56.64% of the variation. In comparison, the remaining 43.36% could be explained by the physical properties of glaciers themselves (i.e., degree-day factor on ice, degree-day factor on snow, glacier median height, aspect, and slope). This study not only improves our understanding of the spatiotemporal change in GR in the drylands of northwestern China at spatial and temporal resolutions but also highlights the role of physical properties in explaining the heterogeneous dynamics among GRs unlike previous studies that only emphasize rising temperatures.

To alleviate water stress, soil fertility decline and reduce runoff, soil and water conservation measures are promising options whose impact on agricultural productivity has not been fully explored. The objective of the study was to assess the effect of using zai pits in combination with selected soil fertility ammendments. An experiment was conducted in Tharaka Nithi County, Kenya to assess effects of using Zai pits in combination with selected amendments on sorghum production. The experiment was set up in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) involving 12 soil and water conservation treatments with three replications per block. Experimental data were subjected to analysis of variance and mean separation done using least significant difference (LSD) at p < 0.05. Zai pit in combination with tithonia amendment had the highest yields of 4.30 Mg ha(-1) during short rains season of 2013 while Zai pit in combination with cattle manure had the highest yield of 4.18 Mg ha(-1) during short rains season of 2014. Conventional planting with full rate NPK had the highest benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of 3.58 while Zai pit without input had the least BCR of 0.99. The experiment showed that Zai pit technology contributed to increments of yields in comparison to conventional planting although its BCR was lower than conventional planting with similar amendments. However, both Zai pit and conventional practices should be used in combination with organic and inorganic amendments to enhance yields in sorghum production.

In this study, we analyzed the impact of biopolymeric soil amendments on the PSD of a dryland loamy soil based on its physical and biological properties using a completely randomized design with four treatments consisting of two different dosages (10 and 5 g kg(-1)) of two different biopolymers, (chitosan [CH] and Arabic gum [AG]) plus a reference soil. To determine the effects of CH and AG on the PSD, nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry (NMRR) measurements were used to determine the longitudinal (T-1) and transversal (T-2) relaxation times. A set of soil structure-related characteristics was also determined in the laboratory. The results revealed that T-2 spectra provided a good proxy to determine the PSD, showing good agreement between the PSD from T-2 spectra and that calculated from the water retention curve (WRC) (R-2 > 0.78; RMSE < 1.38 mu m). The application of CH also increased the zeta potential of the soil to -18.5 mV, compared with -20 mV obtained for the reference soil. The WRC measurements revealed that AG decreased the available water content for plant use compared with the reference soil, whereas CH increased the available water in comparison to the reference soil. Considering the parameters of the van Genuchten model, the application of AG and CH mainly affected the parameter alpha, confirming the dominant changes in macropores. This finding was confirmed by NMRR relaxation spectra. Furthermore, the application of CH and AG stimulated the microbial activity of the amended soil, leading to an increase in soil respiration.

However, effects of seeding rate and nitrogen (N) addition on ACS forage production and suppressing foxtail barley (Hordeum jubatum L.) (FTB) weed infestation on saline environments are poorly understood. A 3-yr experiment with four ACS seeding rates (2.8, 5.6, 11.2, and 16.8 kg ha(-1) pure live seed) and a 3-yr experiment with three N levels (0, 50, and 150 kg ha(-1) actual N) were conducted on a severe to very severe range of saline dryland. The 5.6 and 11.2 kg ha(-1) ACS seeding rates had similar forage yields to the 16.8 kg ha(-1) seeding rate and better FTB suppress compared to the lowest seeding rate. Therefore, 5.6 kg ha(-1) seeding rate may be suitable under certain conditions. However, high salinity ranges and challenging environments could justify recommending the higher seeding rate. The ACS forage yields and qualities were higher in 50 and 150 kg ha(-1) of actual N in 2014, while yields in 2015 were only higher in 150 kg ha(-1) compared with the control but was similar to the 50 kg ha(-1). No yield and quality differences were observed in 2016 and no FTB yield and relative yield differences were detected in each year among treatments. Therefore, a single large N fertilizer application in severe salt-affected drylands was not beneficial over successive years compared to lower N application, and the suppression of FTB in ACS pasture by N addition is not recommended.																			0002-1962	1435-0645				JAN-FEB	2019	111	1					328	335		10.2134/agronj2018.06.0395	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2018.06.0395													WOS:000454881500036

Yet few studies have focused on how long-term secondary succession affects the functional profiles and ecological processes of abundant and rare microbial subcommunities. Here, we used amplicon sequencing and GeoChip analysis to explore the ecological functions of abundant and rare biospheres and their correlation with soil multinutrient cycling. Samples for this study were collected from a well-established secondary succession chronosequence that spans >30 years of dryland ecosystem development on the Loess Plateau of China. Although both abundant and rare subcommunities shifted with succession, the changing of beta-diversity of the microbial communities was primarily driven by species replacement of the rare biosphere. Phylogenetic changes of abundant and rare taxa were associated with their functional traits, which dominated the diversity-related selection along all succession ages. Neutral theory analysis indicated that the assemblage of abundant taxa over all successional ages was regulated by dispersal homogenizing and ecological drift. The null model revealed that homogeneous and variable selection were the dominant assembly processes for rare subcommunities compared with abundant species. pH and nitrogen content were the paramount drivers determining the assembly of microbial communities and functional genes, consistent with the importance of environmental filtering. Furthermore, the rare biosphere had a paramount role in the entire ecological network and was the major driver for most soil processes such as C, N, and S cycling. Nonetheless, a significant portion of soil P cycling was regulated by abundant taxa. Collectively, our study provides insight into the mechanisms underlying microbial community assembly and soil microbedriven functional changes in biogeochemical processes during secondary succession.

Large-scale environmental flow results in mixed outcomes with short-term benefits for a semi-arid floodplain plant community	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Demonstrating and predicting the effectiveness of environmental watering to maintain ecosystem health is becoming increasingly important, notably in semi-arid floodplain ecosystems. Modelling plant floodplain vegetation responses to inform environmental watering outcomes is also challenging. We evaluated the effects of a large-scale environmental flow event on a semi-arid floodplain lakeside plant assemblage for meeting the management goal of increasing water-dependant taxa and functional groups. We developed a multi-taxon Bayesian hierarchical model to describe temporal and small-scale spatial patterns in taxonomic occurrences. We then examined community summary metrics (proportion of native taxa, plant functional groups) to evaluate patterns for the entire floodplain lakes system, the scale most relevant to management. Overall, in a system dominated by terrestrial dry plant taxa, 52.9% of terrestrial damp plant taxa showed a short-term increase in occurrence in response to the environmental flow, which translated into similar responses in some functional groups. However, nearly half of the plant taxa that increased then demonstrated a decline by 18 months after the flow event. Our community summary metrics captured these general results; however, they were disproportionately influenced by a few abundant plant taxa. These results highlight the advantages of multi-taxon models for interpreting flow responses and developing effective environmental flow management strategies, because they can be used to summarise community responses, while preserving important taxon-specific information. In semi-arid systems, where river regulation and climate change have reduced the frequency of flood events, the ability to deliver environmental flows during protracted periods of drought may be a policy option to restore or maintain the natural floodplain vegetation assemblage and prevents the transition to dryland taxa.

Genetic variation for micronutrient concentration in germplasm is prerequisite for biofortification of this crop. In the present study, ninety-six lentil genotypes consisting of Indian (released varieties, advanced breeding lines and germplasm lines) and Mediterranean (germplasm lines and landraces) lines were evaluated for grain iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) concentrations and the stability of these traits was studied across three different locations in India. The pooled analysis of variance revealed significant genotype, environment and genotype by environment interaction (GEI) mean squares for both the micronutrients. Stability analysis employing the AMMI model elucidated the first two interaction principal components as significant and cumulatively explained 100% of GEI variation. The first two components explained 55.9% and 44.1% of the GEI sum of squares for grain iron and 50.8% and 49.2% for grain zinc concentration, respectively. No correlation between grain iron and zinc concentration was observed. Among 96 lines, genotypes IG 49, P 16214, ILL 147 and P 2118 were found to be relatively stable, having higher mean iron and zinc concentrations with low modified AMMI stability value (MASV), modified AMMI stability index (MASI) and genotype selection index (GSI). The identified promising genotypes (high Fe: P 16214, IG 115, P 2127 and IC 560812 and high Zn: P 8115, P 3234, LL 461 and IC 560812) can be utilized for studying the genetics of grain Fe and Zn concentration by developing mapping populations and for biofortification of Indian lentil.

The feasibility of determination method and quality standard of soils and sludge for freshwater sediment was investigated in this study. Fractions of heavy metals, nitrogen, phosphorus, and reduced inorganic sulfur (RIS) in different type of samples were determined, including freshwater sediments, dryland and paddy soils, and sludge with air-drying (AD) and freeze-drying (FD) treatment, respectively. Results showed fraction distributions of heavy metals, nitrogen, phosphorus, and RIS in sediments markedly differed from those of soils and sludge. Fraction redistributions of heavy metals, nitrogen, phosphorus, and RIS in sediments were observed with AD compared to those treated by FD. The proportions of heavy metals, nitrogen, and phosphorus associated with organic matter (or sulfide) in FD sediments decreased by 4.8-74.2%, 9.5-37.5%, and 16.1-76.3%, respectively, compared to those in AD sediments, while those associated with Fe/Mn oxides increased by 6.3-39.1%, 50.9-226.9%, and 6.1-31.0%, respectively. The fraction proportions of RIS in sediments with AD also sharply decreased. Determination of standard methods for sludge and soil caused the distortion of pollutant fraction analysis in sediment. Similarly, the quality standard of sludge and soil was inappropriate for sediment quality assessment due to the differences in pollutant fraction pattern between sediment and soils/sludge. Totally, soil and sludge standards are inapplicable for freshwater sediment pollutant determination and quality judgment.This study would greatly advance the establishment of freshwater sediment determination methods and quality standards.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				MAR	2023	195	3							430	10.1007/s10661-023-11032-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11032-z								36847913					WOS:000941126200002

The crop is rich in Fe and Zn, therefore, identification of the key genes operating the mineral pathways is an important step to accelerate the development of biofortified cultivars. In a first-of-its-kind experiment, leaf and root samples of a pearl millet inbred ICMB 1505 were exposed to combinations of Fe and Zn stress conditions using the hydroponics method, and a whole-genome transcriptome assay was carried out to characterize the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pathways. A total of 37,093 DEGs under different combinations of stress conditions were identified, of which, 7,023 and 9,996 DEGs were reported in the leaf and root stress treatments, respectively. Among the 10,194 unique DEGs, 8,605 were annotated to cellular, biological, and molecular functions and 458 DEGs were assigned to 39 pathways. The results revealed the expression of major genes related to the mugineic acid pathway, phytohormones, chlorophyll biosynthesis, photosynthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism during Fe and Zn stress. The cross-talks between the Fe and Zn provided information on their dual and opposite regulation of key uptake and transporter genes under Fe and Zn deficiency. SNP haplotypes in rice, maize, sorghum, and foxtail millet as well as in Arabidopsis using pearl millet Fe and Zn responsive genes could be used for designing the markers in staple crops. Our results will assist in developing Fe and Zn-efficient pearl millet varieties in biofortification breeding programs and precision delivery mechanisms to ameliorate malnutrition in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.

J	Bush, D; Spencer, D; Doran, J; Davis, R				Bush, David; Spencer, David; Doran, John; Davis, Richard			Testing New Provenances of <i>Eucalyptus polybractea</i>: A Eucalypt Oil Mallee Adapted to Semi-Arid Environments	FORESTS												Novel genetic accessions of Eucalyptus polybractea from a previously untested, hotter and drier part of the species' natural range were tested in a common garden trial at a semi-arid site in NSW, Australia. Eucalyptus polybractea is a mallee eucalypt cultivated for essential oils (1,8-cineole), bioenergy and carbon sequestration on dryland sites in southern Australia (sites receiving about 450 mm mean annual rainfall, MAR). A trial of six previously untested provenances from the relatively hot, dry part of the species' natural range in South Australia (SA) (250-450 mm MAR) was established alongside seven provenances from New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria within a commercial plantation in NSW. The trial was assessed at age 3.7 years for growth and oil characteristics. While survival was excellent, most of the SA sources were slower growing and of sub-standard oil concentration and quality relative to those from Victoria and NSW. However, a single SA provenance, with the highest oil concentration and 1,8-cineole percentage of all provenances tested, may have potential as a source of selected germplasm. Infusion of SA material into the breeding populations of E. polybractea, which are currently based on NSW and Victorian selections only, may provide more resilience in the face of hotter and drier temperatures expected under projected climate change scenarios, and/or allow the introduction of the species to hotter and drier climates in Australia or other parts of the world with semi-arid climates. However, high-intensity selection of infusions will be required to maintain the growth and oil characteristics in the existing breeding population.

This tool has been used successfully in several sectors and contexts such as coastal and river adaptation, urban heat waves, floods and rural livelihoods but its use in natural resource management, has faced several challenges and limitations. In the sector of agroforestry its use has seldom been done or documented and one of the reasons for this may due to some of its specific challenges. In this study, these challenges were addressed when using the Adaptation Pathways for the adaptation planning of three case studies in the semi-arid Alentejo region, a Mediterranean dryland of southern Portugal. This tool was integrated in a participatory approach combined with the Scenario Workshop method, to plan the adaptation of the agriculture and forestry sector of one municipality (Me?rtola) and two agroforestry farms (221 ha and 1000 ha). The methodology included, for each case study, 20 interviews, two workshops, literature review, expert analysis and the use of indicators of efficacy of adaptation measures, to define tipping points. The adaptation process and the resulting adaptation plans were evaluated by questionnaire and expert review. This combination of methods has supported the choice of effective adaptation measures for the case studies and when combined with several adaptation pathways and a landscape approach it supported the creation of integrated climate change adaptation plans that are now in implementation. We discuss how this combination of methods deals with limitation to Adaptation Pathways identified in the literature, conclude that the method was able to create adaptation plans that are now under implementation and present avenues for future research.

Here, we evaluated the effects of tillage practice, crop rotation pattern, and crop development on rhizobacteria in a field experiment in the dryland region of northern China. Three tillage [chisel plow tillage (conservation), zero tillage (conservation), and plow tillage (conventional)] practices and two crop rotation (maize-wheat rotation and soybean-wheat rotation) patterns were been combined to assess changes in rhizosphere bacterial communities during wheat development. Our results showed that conservation tillage practices had considerable effects on soil physicochemical properties compared with conventional tillage, thus changing the rhizosphere microenvironment. Spearman's correlation analysis also indicated that soil physicochemical properties were closely related to the relationships among the rhizosphere bacterial communities and taxa. Furthermore, the composition and alpha-diversity of the rhizosphere bacterial communities were substantially affected by the crop growth stage and tillage practices; however, the legacy effect of the previous crop had different effects on the rhizosphere bacterial communities owing to the short period of implementing crop rotation. The phylogenetic diversity and taxonomic composition of rhizosphere bacterial communities were mainly explained by the crop growth stage and tillage practice, respectively. Additionally, conservation tillage practices and soybean-wheat rotation pattern both delayed rhizobacteria successions. Co-occurrence networks also showed that the differential modules among the rhizosphere bacterial communities decreased with wheat development, whereas the soybean-wheat rotation pattern increased their degree of co-occurrence. The differences in taxonomic compositions and phylogenetic diversities of the rhizosphere bacterial communities may affect their potential functions and alter crop growth and development.

In this study, a 3-year experiment with two types of fertilizers and five N addition levels was conducted in a semiarid steppe of Erguna, Inner Mongolia to assess the effects of exogenous N input on net ecosystem productivity (NEP), gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). Our results showed that enhanced N input significantly increased NEP and GEP when the volumetric soil water content (VWC) was greater than 15% (v/v%), but had trivial and inconsistent effects when VWC was less than that threshold. Moreover, the NEP and GEP increased significantly with increasing N addition but leveled off when the N input reached 10 g N m(-2) year(-1) and the VWC was above 15%. However, the ER showed a significant increase with N addition rates, regardless of soil water content. Our main findings are as follows. First, the ecosystem C exchange can be significantly enhanced by addition of N only when soil moisture exceeds certain threshold, suggesting co-limitation of water and N in the grassland ecosystem that we studied. Second, in addition to concurrent consideration of water, temperature and N as well as their interactions also need to be accounted for. Third, the frequency of days with the VWC being higher than 15% accounted only around one third of days during the three growing seasons. Taken together, our findings imply that the expected increases of carbon sequestration should be minimal under N deposition in the Inner Mongolia grassland ecosystems.

Data on yield and other agronomic traits were analysed using a multi-environment trial approach that accommodated the factorial treatment structure (genotype by irrigation regime) within individual trials. Considerable variation was observed in the durum germplasm for productivity and grain quality traits. DBA Bindaroi (NSW) and 101042 (ICARDA) were the top yielders in watered and rainfed blocks, respectively. The yield was positively and strongly related to both harvest index and grains/m(,)(2) but grains/m(2) was negatively related to thousand grain weight (TGW) and positively related to screenings. TGW and screenings were strongly negatively related and TGW and grains/m(2) showed a weak positive relationship. Promising genotypes were identified, with superior traits to both the bread wheat check, EGA Gregory and the durum check, Caparoi. Overall, lines from SA and ICARDA were superior for yield but those from NSW were superior for quality parameters including TGW and screenings. These results suggested the possibility of developing high yielding high-quality durum varieties by crossing NSW lines with SA, CIMMYT and ICARDA lines through simultaneous selection for yield, TGW and low screenings. The results also suggested that productivity in rainfed conditions was positively related to productivity under watering, but further research is required to establish this.

Accounting for aboveground carbon storage in shrubland and woodland ecosystems in the Great Basin	ECOSPHERE												Improving the accuracy of carbon accounting in terrestrial ecosystems is critical for understanding carbon fluxes associated with land cover change, with significant implications for global carbon cycling and climate change. Semi-arid ecosystems account for an estimated 45% of global terrestrial ecosystem area and are in many locations experiencing high degrees of degradation. However, aboveground carbon accounting has largely focused on tropical and forested ecosystems, while drylands have been relatively neglected. Here, we used a combination of field estimates, remotely sensed data, and existing land cover maps to create a spatially explicit estimate of aboveground carbon storage within the Great Basin, a semi-arid region of the western United States encompassing 643,500 km(2) of shrubland and woodland vegetation. We classified the region into seven distinct land cover categories: pinyon-juniper woodland, sagebrush steppe, salt desert shrub, low sagebrush, forest, non-forest, and other/excluded, each with an associated carbon estimate. Aboveground carbon estimates for pinyon-juniper woodland were continuous values based on tree canopy cover. Carbon estimates for other land cover categories were based on a mean value for the land cover type. The Great Basin ecosystems contain an estimated 295.4 Tg in aboveground carbon, which is almost double the previous estimates that only accounted for forested ecosystems in the same area. Aboveground carbon was disproportionately stored in pinyon-juniper woodland (43.7% carbon, 16.9% land area), while the shrubland systems accounted for roughly half of the total land area (49.1%) and one-third of the total carbon. Our results emphasize the importance of distinguishing and accounting for the distinctive contributions of shrubland and woodland ecosystems when creating carbon storage estimates for dryland regions.

P is immobile in nature and, therefore, the identification of novel genotypes with efficient P uptake and utilization under a low P environment is extremely important. This study was designed to characterize eighty genotypes of different Lens species for shoot and root traits at two contrasting levels of P. A significant reduction in primary root length (PRL), total surface area (TSA), total root tips (TRT), root forks (RF), total dry weight (TDW), root dry weight (RDW) and shoot dry weight (SDW) in response to P deficiency was recorded. A principal component analysis revealed that the TDW, SDW and RDW were significantly correlated to P uptake and utilization efficiency in lentils. Based on total dry weight (TDW) under low P, L4727, EC718309, EC714238, PL-97, EC718348, DPL15, PL06 and EC718332 were found promising. The characterization of different Lens species revealed species-specific variations for the studied traits. Cultivated lentils exhibited higher P uptake and utilization efficiency as compared to the wild forms. The study, based on four different techniques, identified EC714238 as the most P use-efficient genotype. The genotypes identified in this study can be utilized for developing mapping populations and deciphering the genetics for breeding lentil varieties suited for low P environments.

Comparing the effects of vegetation presence at eroding and depositional sites would provide a direct understanding of such effects. Herein, we investigated how soil N dynamics (mineral N pools and net N mineralization rates) responded to vegetation presence (plot with vs. without vegetation), landscape position (eroding vs. depositional sites) and vegetation type (grassland vs. woodland) during a two-year manipulation experiment using an in-situ incubation method in the hilly-gully region of China's Loess Plateau. The results showed that soils on eroding site had higher concentrations of nitrate (3.820 +/- 0.302 vs. 2.642 +/- 0.280 mg kg-1) and mineral N (5.853 +/- 0.320 vs. 4.308 +/- 0.287 mg kg-1) but similar rates of net nitrification (0.057 +/- 0.013 vs. 0.051 +/- 0.011 mg kg-1 d-1) and mineralization (0.056 +/- 0.014 vs. 0.056 +/- 0.013 mg kg-1 d-1) in comparison to depositional site in all grassland plots. The concentrations of soil nitrate and mineral N and rates of net nitrification and mineralization in legume woodland were 26%, 19%, 88% and 64% higher than that in grassland in all slope plots, respectively. Although vegetation presence significantly decreased soil nitrate (-57%) and total mineral N (-27%) concentrations, it did not affect the rates of net nitrification and mineralization. The effects of vegetation presence on soil net N mineralization occurred irrespective of landscape position and vegetation type(P > 0.05), but varied with season or year, with greater effects in 2017 growing season than in the non-growing season and 2018 growing season. Redundancy analysis and hierarchical partitioning indicated that the above- and blow-ground biomass accounted for most of the variation in soil N mineralization. These results suggested that the variations in soil mineral N and net N mineralization in relation to vegetation presence in this eroding watershed were consistent across different landscape positions and vegetation types, but showed intra- and inter-annual variability.					luo, yuan/JLS-6416-2023														0167-8809	1873-2305				FEB 28	2022	325								107743	10.1016/j.agee.2021.107743	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2021.107743		NOV 2021											WOS:000719266400002
J	Zhang, J; Xu, M; Xu, MX				Zhang, Jian; Xu, Ming; Xu, Ming-Xiang			Characterising the diversity and functionality of the microbial community within biocrusts associated with different vegetation communities and soil habitats	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												In arid and semi-arid ecosystems, the biocrust serves as an important biological interface in the topsoil. Although the biocrust and vascular plant and soil are closely related, microbial diversity and functional characteristics in biocrusts of different vegetation communities and soil habitats, especially in watershed conditions, is poorly understood. In this study, biocrust samples were collected from two different soil substrate habitats, the loess and the aeolian sandy soil, as well as three plant communities consisting of Stipa bungeana, Artemisia ordosica, and Populus simonii, with the farmland soil acting as the control at the small watershed scale in the interlaced water and wind eroded area of Northern Shaanxi, China. To characterise the microbial diversity and functionality within biocrusts, a total of 4705 and 219 16S and 18S rDNA OTUs, respectively, were classified using high-throughput sequencing. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were dominant in prokaryotic community, whereas Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were dominant in fungal community in biocrusts. Principal coordinate analysis and hierarchical clustering demonstrated significant differences in prokaryotic and fungal communities between farmland soil and biocrusts, and soil parent materials could be a major factor in shaping the difference in the microbial communities of biocrusts relative to the vegetation types. Soil pH and carbon were dominant environmental factors that affected the prokaryotic and fungal communities in biocrusts. Hence, we demonstrated that the biocrust can significantly improve the topsoil properties in the study region, while their prokaryotic and fungal communities are largely determined by soil properties and environmental parameters.

However, in terms of the depositional characteristics of C and N in check dams, research on the relative effects of erosion intensity and depositional area is limited, hindering our understanding of the fates of eroded C and N. This study compared the horizontal and vertical distributions of soil particles, organic C (OC), and total N (TN) in check dams of various sizes and erosion intensities in the Loess Plateau. The results showed greater variations in the horizontal and vertical patterns of soil particles of smaller check dams and highly serious erosion (erosion modulus = 15040 t km(-2) a(-1)) than those that of larger check dams and strong erosion regions (erosion modulus = 5151 t km(-2) a-1). Soil OC and TN contents decreased from the dam body to the gully head, especially in the highly serious erosion region. Notably, the effect of smaller check dam on the vertical distributions of soil OC and TN was more intense than that of the larger check dam in the strong erosion region. In contrast, a minor effect of check dam size was observed in the highly serious erosion region. Moreover, a closer relationship between the distribution of OC and TN with silt content rather than with clay content in check dams was observed, and this relationship was enhanced by an increase in erosion intensity. Overall, the synergistic effects of erosion intensity and check dam size affected the spatial patterns of OC and TN in sediments on the Loess Plateau. Careful consideration of these two factors is beneficial for accurately assessing the C and N fates in depositional areas.

Selective and effective measures to control the parasite are extremely limited. In recent studies, we have shown that granular formulations of dinitroaniline cell division-inhibiting herbicides applied after crop establishment and before dodder germination fit our dodder control strategy and kill the parasite effectively and selectively. The aim of our study conducted from 2014 to 2018 was to evaluate the efficacy and selectivity of granular pendimethalin for dodder control in chickpea under laboratory, greenhouse, and field conditions. Petri dish experiments revealed that the herbicide reduces dodder seed germination while its main effect is a restriction of shoot elongation. Greenhouse experiments demonstrated that the inhibition and distortion of dodder shoot growth impede shoot twining and prevent attachment to the host plant. In dose-response experiments conducted in the greenhouse, we observed that half the recommended rate of granular pendimethalin provides efficient dodder control with no damage to chickpea seedlings. In 3 yr of chickpea field trials, GPM applied across the seeding bed at the recommended rate resulted in high crop yields that were not significantly different from those observed for the untreated no-dodder control, while half of the recommended dose efficiently controlled dodder and other weeds with no damage to the crop, resulting in significantly increased chickpea yields and profitability. These studies indicate that GPM can provide efficient and selective dodder control in chickpea.

Integrated Farming System Model for Sustained Farm Income and Employment Generation Under Rainfed <i>Vertisol</i> of Southern Zone of Tamil Nadu	NATIONAL ACADEMY SCIENCE LETTERS-INDIA												The study on integrated farming system (IFS) was conducted during 2011-2017 at Agricultural Research Station, Kovilpatti, to find out economic viability of IFS model by changing in crop(s) or cropping system and integrating different livestock enterprises. The IFS model consisted of five crops or cropping systems, viz. sorghum (K-8) + cowpea (Co-7) (1:1) (0.40 ha), maize [CoH (m)-6] + greengram (Co-6) (1:1) (0.15 ha), cotton (KC-3) + blackgram (UBN-6) (1:1) (0.60 ha), clusterbean (local variety) (0.15), fodder crops [sorghum (COFS 29), Deshmanthus (local variety)] (0.30 ha) with dairy (1 cow + 1 calf of Sindi breed) and goatery (10 does + 1 buck of kanni breed) components in 1.60 ha total area. The results indicated that the IFS model is good enough to provide sustained average net income of ` 137,712/ha and employment of 389 man days/year as compared to conventional cropping systems (CCS) which gave average negative net income of ` 644/ha during 6 years of investigation due to deficit of rainfall. Thus, it is concluded that farm productivity and profitability as well as employment generation could be sustained by integrating different enterprises, i.e. dairy and goatery along with modified cropping systems in Southern Zone of Tamil Nadu.

In this study, we employed multivariate analysis and geostatistical methods to investigate the degree and distribution types of soil salinization and the hydrochemical characteristics of shallow groundwater. We also examined the relationship between soil salinization and hydrogeochemical characteristics by analyzing the sources of groundwater ions. This study developed a hydrogeochemical model to describe the soil salinization process in the Ningxia Plain. The results indicate that the majority of surface soils are alkaline type soils, followed by chloride-sulfate type soils. The groundwater is mainly fresh water and brackish water, with a hydrochemical type of SO4.HCO3-Ca.Mg or SO4.Cl-Ca.Mg. Saline water and salt water are represented by Cl-Na.Mg or Cl.SO4-Na.Mg. We also observed spatial trends in groundwater depth and total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations that were opposite to soil salinity, which suggests a certain degree of second-order trend effect. Furthermore, the degree of soil salinization increased and then decreased from the pre-mountain alluvial plain to the Yellow River alluvial plain, while the groundwater chemistry ranged from simple to complex. The most severe area of soil salinization was found to be concentrated between Hongguang and Yaofu, which is also the area where shallow groundwater salinity accumulation is mainly influenced by continental salinization. In summary, this study provides valuable insights into the hydrogeochemical characteristics of the Ningxia Plain, which can inform strategies for mitigating soil salinization and promoting sustainable agriculture development in arid regions.																				2296-6463				AUG 15	2023	11								1186779	10.3389/feart.2023.1186779	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2023.1186779													WOS:001057237100001

The risk of decline due to climate aridification of this neglected biodiversity has been overlooked despite its ecological and societal importance. To fill this gap, we assessed the risk of decline due to climate aridification of tree species in warm drylands based on spatialized occurrence data and climate models. We considered both species vulnerability and exposure, compared the risk of tree species decline across five bioregions and searched for phylogenetic correlates. Depending on the future climate model, from 44% to 88% of warm drylands' tree species will undergo climate aridification with a high risk of decline even under the most optimistic conditions. On a regional scale, the rate of species that will undergo climate aridification in the future varies from 21% in the Old World North, to 90% in Australia, with a risk of decline confirming the high level of risk predicted at the global scale. Using generalized linear mixed models, we found that, species more exposed to climate aridification will be more at risk, but also that species vulnerability is a key driver of their risk of decline. Indeed, the warm drylands specialist species will be less at risk due to climate aridification than species being marginal in warm drylands. We also found that the risk of decline is widespread across the main clades of the phylogeny and involves several evolutionary distinct species. Estimating a high risk of decline for numerous tree species in all warm drylands, including emblematic dryland endemics, our work warns that future increase in aridity could result in an extensive erosion of tree biodiversity in these ecosystems.

The relationships of fine root length density (FRLD), soil water content (SWC), and soil NO3--N content (SNC) in agroforestry systems is essential for optimal orchard management. Our objective was to understand the temporal and spatial dynamics of FRLD, SWC, and SNC in an apple-soybean intercropping system and competition between species for ecological niches. We established an orchard with soybean and apple, including monoculture apple (MA), monoculture soybean (MS), and apple-soybean intercrop (AS) treatments. We collected data on the distribution of FRLD, SWC, SNC, and productivity under the MA, AS, and MS from 2020 to 2021. This study showed that AS had more FRLD compared to MA, and intercropping apple (IA) FRLD increased at 20-60 cm soil depth at 50 and 100 cm from the tree and decreased at 0-40 cm soil depth at 150 and 200 cm from the tree. Intercropping increased the SWC of the system and decreased the SNC, and the effect of intercropping was concentrated in the soybean cover area. The competition between apple and soybean reached its maximum at soybean seed filling stage, with competition occurring mainly at 100 cm from the tree and at 0-20 cm soil depth. Intercropping affected soybean growth and also reduced soybean yield with a land equivalent ratio = 1.45. By understanding the dynamics of subsoil resources in the apple-soybean intercropping system and interspecific competition, we can provide a theoretical basis for exploring the potential of sustainable intensification of agroforestry systems.

Impact of Cover Crop on Nutrient Losses in an Upland Soil	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS												Nutrient losses through leaching and surface runoff are the main problems in no-till upland soils in Mississippi. A two-year study was conducted in 2016 and 2017 on an Atwood silt loam soil to evaluate the impact of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cover crop (WCC) in no-till dryland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) received poultry litter (PL) on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses in leached and surface runoff water. Experimental design comprised a split-plot with a 2 x 2 treatment arrangement replicated 3 times. Treatments included WCC and winter fallow (WF) were assigned to the main plots, while PL at the rate of 6.7 and 0 Mg ha(-1) was assigned to the subplots. Wheat was planted after harvesting cotton and leachates were collected from October to April using suction cup lysimeters. Surface runoff was collected from the edge of the plots. Nitrate-N concentrations in leachate samples were 45% and 21% less with WCC (9.9 and 17.2 mg L-1) than winter fallow (WF) (18.2 and 22 mg L-1) in the first and second year, respectively. Residual soil NO3-N concentration at the top 15 cm depth before planting cotton was 41% greater with WF than with WCC. In each year, runoff volume and water-soluble P (WP) concentrations were greater with WCC than with WF. It appears that the cover crop utilizes N during its growth period and slowly releases it for the subsequent crops as evidenced by greater cotton dry matter, lint yield, and cotton N uptakes mainly in the first year.																			0010-3624	1532-2416				MAR 9	2021	52	5					536	550		10.1080/00103624.2020.1862154	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2020.1862154		DEC 2020											WOS:000606709800001

Climatic and soil-mineralogical controls on the mobility of trace metal contamination released by informal electronic waste (e-waste) processing	CHEMOSPHERE												Informal e-waste processing is a growing global problem. Local climate and mineralogical factors strongly control the chemical lability and dispersal of trace metals from informal e-waste processing. Previous work on e-waste contamination primarily focused on well-known sites in similar climates. Our exploratory analysis of a long-term (since 2008) e-waste incineration site in East Jerusalem demonstrated the ways in which local factors combined to uniquely control trace metal contaminant mobility. Our results suggest that the combination of e-waste processing methods, climate, and mineralogy at this site generated a geopolymer-like material combining ash from e-waste incineration and mountain rendzina soil. This material strongly sorbs trace metal contaminants. We measured the concentrations of: Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, and Zn at 29 locations around and within the burn site. Samples collected less than 10 m from the edge of the incineration area had trace metal concentrations below the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. E.P.A.) screening levels for residential soil. Sequential extraction showed that similar to 50-80% of the total mobilized Pb was released from the residual solid fraction, suggesting strong sorption or incorporation into soil components. Large differences in the measured average specific surface areas (SSA) of uncontaminated (26.18 m(2)/g) and contaminated (4.48 m(2)/g) samples, despite comparable mineralogy by XRD, suggested the production of a geopolymer-like material. This was supported by close similarities between the SSA values of contaminated samples and those measured for geopolymer materials synthesized in the lab using kaolinite clay and fly ash (e.g., 4.9 m(2)/g).

At a case study site in Inner Mongolia, simulation with a plant phenological model was used to determine whether sweet sorghum could reach the harvestable stage for sugar juice production. The blue water in the agricultural phase was estimated according to the potential crop evapotranspiration (ETc), the drought sensitivity of sweet sorghum in different stages and the precipitation during the growing season. The results showed that the irrigation water was significantly different among the districts, ranging from 730 to 5500 m(3)/ha and 2060 to 6680 m(3)/ha for early-maturing and late-maturing varieties, respectively. To avoid the water pressure level to be exacerbated and the severe reallocation of water resources resulting in negative effects on other sectors, the maximal annual water withdrawal was set to not surpass the upper threshold of water stress level of 40%. That makes the maximum area for the production of sweet sorghum cannot exceed 1.95 x 10(4) ha, representing only 0.24% of the total marginal land area in Inner Mongolia. However, the economic benefits of bioenergy production from sweet sorghum would be negative due to the high labour input. Therefore, not only the availability of marginal land, the climate conditions and local water resources but also the improvement of mechanisation and agricultural production techniques should be considered to attain the sustainable development of bioenergy production and address global energy and environmental crises.

Assessing key behavioural theories of drought risk adaptation: Evidence from rural Kenya	RISK ANALYSIS												The Horn of Africa Drylands are increasingly experiencing severe droughts, which impose a threat on traditional livelihood strategies. Understanding adaptation behavior in rural communities is key to helping reduce the impact of these droughts. We investigate adaptation behavior by assessing four established economic and social psychological theories on decision making under risk: expected utility theory (EUT), rank dependent utility theory (RDU), protection motivation theory (PMT), and theory of planned behavior (PMT). To measure adaptation behavior and the theory constructs, we conducted a household survey in Kenya (N = 502). Regression analysis shows that the economic theories (EUT and RDU) have the best fit for our data. Risk and time preferences are found to play an important role in adaptation decisions. An analysis of differences in decision making for distinct types of adaptation measures shows that risk averse (agro-)pastoralists are more likely to implement adaptation measures that are adjustments to their current livelihood practices, and less willing to invest in adaptation measures that require a shift to other livelihood activities. Moreover, we find significant effects for elements of the social psychological theories (PMT and TPB). A person's belief in their own ability to implement an adaptation measure (perceived self-efficacy) and adaptation by family and friends are important factors in explaining adaptation decisions. Finally, we find that the type of adaptation measures that people implement is influenced by, among others, gender, education level, access to financial resources, and access to government support or aid. Our analysis gives insights into the drivers of individual adaptation decisions, which can enhance policies promoting adaptation of dryland communities.

However, data and information regarding black soils in tropical regions, including Indonesia, are limited. This study aimed to characterize and identify the utilization of black soils in Indonesia based on legacy soil survey data. We collated 142 soil pedon samples of Mollisols from articles, technical reports, and existing datasets. The site information (site position, elevation, land use type, parent material) and selected physicochemical properties were stored in a spreadsheet, from which exploratory data analysis was conducted. The result showed that the median SOC content was 1.53%, ranging from 0.6 to 8.2 %; cation exchange capacity was 30 cmol kg(-1) , ranging from 9 to 95 cmol kg(-1) ; base saturation was 87%, ranging from 11 to 100 %; and bulk density was 1.21 g cm(-3 ), ranging from 1.13 to 1.36 g cm(-3) . Other soil characteristics (particle size distribution, exchangeable bases, pH, pore, and water retention) varied with horizon type and land use/land cover. The black soils have been used for paddy fields, dryland farming, and gardens with low management intensity. Main cultivated crops include rice (Oryza sativa), corn (Zea mays), cassava (Manihot esculenta), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), and nutmeg (Myristica fragrans), clove (Syzygium aromaticum), coconut (Cocos nucifera), and cocoa (Theobroma cocoa). Threats to black soil functions include soil erosion, carbon loss, and nutrient imbalance. Soil and water conservation measures, integrated soil nutrient management, and agroforestry are among the best land management practices for black soils.					null, Nurdin,/E-6569-2019; Sulaeman, Yiyi/H-1409-2011	null, Nurdin,/0000-0001-5725-5694; Sulaeman, Yiyi/0000-0001-5792-2629; , Sukarman/0000-0001-7593-2388													1412-3606	2356-1424				JUN	2023	20	1					114	123		10.20961/stjssa.v20i1.70343	http://dx.doi.org/10.20961/stjssa.v20i1.70343													WOS:001087658100012

Worldwide, land-based environmental conservation efforts and agricultural preservation regulations are often concurrent. Complex social-ecological feedback within the coupled natural and human systems nevertheless confounds their effects. Drawing on population-level data for a township encompassed by a national nature reserve, this study applies a spatially explicit agent-based model to understand human-environment interrelationships with household landuse decisions about cropland abandonment restricted by the agricultural preservation rule. Results show that labor migration and cropland abandonment involve feedback loops that exhibit nonlinear effects. The availability of household labor and the amount of cultivated land mediate these effects. The land-use decisions of the farm households are sensitive to the relaxation of the abandonment restriction. The prevalence of cropland abandonment in extent and size increases prominently as the restriction rule begins to relax. The model shows a clearly emerging spatial pattern of an increasing likelihood of cropland abandonment with the relaxed restriction. Abandonment is more likely on dryland parcels and parcels at higher elevations, steeper slopes, and in proximity to forest areas. The shifted distributions of cropland parcels by their biophysical and geographical features from the baseline scenario (full restriction) to the experimental scenario (complete relaxation) also demonstrate these trends. Targeting cropland parcels bearing high risks of abandonment can improve the costeffectiveness of implementing forest restoration policies while prioritizing those with low risks for agricultural stabilization. The agent-based model is useful for explaining the underlying drivers of land change involving human decision-making. It also suggests implications for balancing trade-offs between environmental conservation and agricultural production.

When the strain YL24-3 was compared to Pedobacter yulinensis YL28-9(T) using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the resemblance was 98.6% and the strain was classified as Pedobacter sp. using physiological and biochemical analysis. Furthermore, strain YL24-3 was also identified as a subspecies of Pedobacter yulinensis YL28-9(T) on the basis of DNA-DNA hybridization and polar lipid analysis compared with YL28-9(T). On the basis of the EPS-related genes of relevant strains in the GenBank, several EPS-related genes were cloned and sequenced in the strain YL24-1, including those potentially involved in EPS synthesis, assembly, transport, and secretion. Given the differences of the strains in EPS production, it is possible that the differences in gene sequences result in variations in the enzyme/protein activities for EPS biosynthesis, assembly, transport, and secretion. The results provide preliminary evidence of various contributions of bacterial strains to the formation of EPS matrix in the Mu Us Desert.					chen, shaolin/AAE-8427-2022; Hu, Xiao/GQI-0007-2022	chen, shaolin/0000-0001-7607-8275; Hu, Xiao/0000-0003-1128-4099; Bold, Nomin/0000-0002-6715-3904														1420-3049				SEP	2021	26	18							5521	10.3390/molecules26185521	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules26185521								34576992					WOS:000701788300001

Evaluation of peanut tolerance to mid-season applications of PPO-Inhibitor herbicides mixed with different surfactants	CROP PROTECTION												Protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) inhibitor herbicides are being increasingly used to control acetolactate synthases (ALS) inhibitor-resistant weeds in peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L.). However, PPO-inhibitor herbicides can injure the crop under certain application conditions, especially under abiotic stress and surfactants may exacerbate this injury. The objectives of this study were to 1) investigate the effect of PPO-inhibitor based treatments on dryland peanut growth and yield when applied at three timings in mid-season, 2) evaluate the interactions of surfactants, chloroacetamide herbicides, and PPO-inhibitors, and 3) assess the level of correlation of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) readings to traditional visible injury rating. Field studies were conducted in Henry and Escambia counties in Alabama, U.S. during 2018, and 2019. Up to 55% of visible peanut injury was observed with acifluorfen, lactofen, and carfentrazone-ethyl treatments. In general, the NDVI readings correlated significantly with traditional visible injury ratings. A tank mixture of chloroacetamide herbicides (pyroxasulfone, S-metolachlor, dimethenamid-P) with lactofen did not lead to more injury or yield loss than lactofen applied alone. Yield losses up 27% were observed with carfentrazone-ethyl plus a high surfactant oil concentrate (HSOC) at 75 and 90 days after planting (DAP) as compared to the non-treated check (NTC). Overall, treatments with HSOC and/or carfentrazone-ethyl were more likely to cause significant injury and yield loss than treatments with acifluorfen or lactofen plus nonionic surfactant (NIS). Peanuts are more sensitive to PPOinhibitor herbicides at 75 DAP. NDVI did provide additional plant health information to subjective injury ratings, however, neither of these measurements are reliable predictors of peanut yield loss.																			0261-2194	1873-6904				MAY	2021	143								105557	10.1016/j.cropro.2021.105557	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2021.105557		JAN 2021											WOS:000624583900005

Predicting Wheat Yield at the Field Scale by Combining High-Resolution Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery and Crop Modelling	REMOTE SENSING												Accurate prediction of crop yield at the field scale is critical to addressing crop production challenges and reducing the impacts of climate variability and change. Recently released Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite data with a return cycle of five days and a high resolution at 13 spectral bands allows close observation of crop phenology and crop physiological attributes at field scale during crop growth. Here, we test the potential for indices derived from S2 data to estimate dryland wheat yields at the field scale and the potential for enhanced predictability by incorporating a modelled crop water stress index (SI). Observations from 103 study fields over the 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons across Northeastern Australia were used. Vegetation indices derived from S2 showed moderately high accuracy in yield prediction and explained over 70% of the yield variability. Specifically, the red edge chlorophyll index (CI; chlorophyll) (R-2 = 0.76, RMSE = 0.88 t/ha) and the optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI; structural) (R-2 = 0.74, RMSE = 0.91 t/ha) showed the best correlation with field yields. Furthermore, combining the crop model-derived SI with both structural and chlorophyll indices significantly enhanced predictability. The best model with combined OSAVI, CI and SI generated a much higher correlation, with R-2 = 0.91 and RMSE = 0.54 t/ha. When validating the models on an independent set of fields, this model also showed high correlation (R-2 = 0.93, RMSE = 0.64 t/ha). This study demonstrates the potential of combining S2-derived indices and crop model-derived indices to construct an enhanced yield prediction model suitable for fields in diversified climate conditions.

Moreover, the frequency of N inputs may affect primary productivity but is rarely studied. To assess the response patterns of above- and belowground productivity to rates of N addition under different addition frequencies, we manipulated the rate (0-50 g N m(-2) year(-1)) and frequency (twice vs. monthly additions per year) of NH4NO3 inputs for six consecutive years in a temperate grassland in northern China and measured ANPP and BNPP from 2012 to 2014. In the low range of N addition rates, BNPP showed the greatest negative response and ANPP showed the greatest positive responses with increases in N addition (<10 g N m(-2) year(-1)). As N addition increased beyond 10 g N m(-2) year(-1), increases in ANPP dampened and decreases in BNPP ceased altogether. The response pattern of net primary productivity (combined above- and belowground; NPP) corresponded more closely to ANPP than to BNPP. The N effects on BNPP and BNPP/NPP (f(BNPP)) were not dependent on N addition frequency in the range of N additions typically associated with N deposition. BNPP was more sensitive to N addition frequency than ANPP, especially at low rates of N addition. Our findings provide new insights into how plants regulate carbon allocation to different organs with increasing N rates and changing addition frequencies. These root response patterns, if incorporated into Earth system models, may improve the predictive power of C dynamics in dryland ecosystems in the face of global atmospheric N deposition.

Thus, we conducted a three-year field experiment to explore two spring maize sowing patterns (FS, flat sowing; RFPM, ridge and furrow plastic film mulching) and four N management strategies (N0, no N fertilizer; N1, normal urea as base fertilizer; N2, split application of normal urea at sowing and a large flare period at a ratio of 3:2; N3, all controlled-release urea as base fertilizer) on growth, the grain yield, the N uptake and utilization efficiency, N2O emissions, and economic benefits in the Loess Plateau region of China. Our results showed that compared to FS, RFPM promoted growth of the spring maize canopy and increased the grain yield, cumulative N uptake, and N use efficiency. RFPM promoted N2O emissions by improving the soil's hydrothermal environment, but it reduced the environmental cost (yield-scaled N2O emission). RFPM increased the production cost, but it increased the net income by improving the total output. Compared to traditional N management strategies (N1), N2 and N3 treatments improved the spring maize productivity and net income, and they reduced the environmental costs by improving the synchronization of the nitrogen supply. However, due to the decreasing rural labor force available in China, N3 is more beneficial in terms of reducing labor inputs. Therefore, we suggest that RFPM and N3 can be combined to form an efficient management strategy for spring maize production in the Loess Plateau that balances crop productivity, N2O emissions, and economic benefits.																				2073-4395				SEP	2023	13	9							2220	10.3390/agronomy13092220	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13092220													WOS:001079675600001

Micro -palaeontological, palynological, and sedimentological analyses were conducted on a total of ten drilled cores, revealing local and regional events. Facies and micropalaeontological analyses show that the lagoon was partially connected to the sea between 6.2 ka BP and 3.1 ka BP. Between 3.1 ka BP and 2.4 ka BP, the area was characterised by marshes and swamps with restricted brackish lagoon conditions and permanent freshwater input. After 2.4 ka BP, the continuous freshwater influx from the major rivers of the coastal plain determined the progradation of the floodplain and the closure of the lagoon, with the formation of the two coastal lakes of Lago Salso (north) and Lago Salpi (south). Pollen data show the expansion of halophytic herbs under local brackish conditions during the Early Meghalayan and the continuous spread of dryland herbs consistent with the closure of the basin. The alluvial plain progradation during the Late Meghalayan allowed the intensive exploitation of the area and the development of a highly anthropogenic landscape. The development of the settlements of pre -Roman Salpia Vetus, Roman Salapia, and Medieval Salpi was mainly determined by the insalubrious condition of the surrounding marshes, due to the reduction in water depth and oscillations in salinity.

The purpose of this study was to develop empirical models to estimate cumulative soil evaporation ( n-ary sumation Es) from a maize field across the basin and runoff area (BA and RA) of the in-field rainwater harvesting (IRWH) technique as influenced by different levels of stover mulch ("dry-mulch") and canopy shading ("green-mulch"). Soil water evaporation (Es) was measured with micro-lysimeters 300 mm deep and 71 mm in diameter in the BA and RA sections for three consecutive drying cycles. Four different runoff strip lengths, RSL (RSL-1, 1.5, 2 and 3m) and three mulching levels (ML) of bare, 39%, and 96% were used to estimate the Es. The coefficient crop cover (Kcover) values for full and partial canopy shade (FC and PC) on the RA were in the range of 0.46-0.97 and 0.43-0.94, respectively, while in the BA the Kcover values ranged between 0.33 and 0.92. Under IRWH, the n-ary sumation Es values from a basin area beneath a maize canopy averaged 42% of the seasonal rainfall. n-ary sumation Es proportion of seasonal rainfall is about 62, 64, and 66 percent for bare soil, but as low as 28, 30 and 32 percent for FC, PC, and unshaded canopy (UC), respectively. In conclusion, the microclimate of the cropping system changes according to surface treatments, which greatly affect the Es losses for the IRWH technique and contributes to ET partitioning. Hence, reducing unproductive water losses in dryland crop production improves water use efficiency by storing more water in the root zone for transpiration.

M.; Wang, Yu			Artificial ponds as hotspots of nitrogen removal in agricultural watershed	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Small waters, like ponds, are the most abundant freshwater environments, and are increasingly recognized for their function in ecosystem service delivery. In agricultural watershed, artificial ponds play an essential role in reducing nitrogen pollution. However, until now artificial ponds remain the least investigated part of water environments. The importance of microbial activities has seldom been discussed, which makes the microbial pathways and processes rates in nitrogen removal poorly understood. To illustrate the role of artificial ponds in microbial nitrogen removal in agricultural watersheds, 21 pond sediments and 11 soils are collected in an agricultural watershed of China. Results show that surface sediments in ponds carry significantly higher dissolved inorganic nitrogen (9.1-21.9 mg/kg) and total organic matter (64.8-113.0 g/kg) compared to the surrounding agricultural soils. High rates of microbial nitrogen removal in ponds (12.4-25.5 nmol N g(-1) h(-1)) are observed, which are 2-9 times higher than those in dryland soils. In pond sediments, denitrification dominates (> 90% N-loss) the microbial nitrogen removal process with only a minor contribution of anaerobic ammonium oxidation. A high potential of N2O production (up to 9.4 nmol N g(-1) h(-1)) occurs in ponds along with the rapid nitrogen removal. For denitrifier genes, nir gene are always more abundant than nosZ gene. Additionally, the nirS gene is more abundant under flooded conditions, while nirK gene prefers higher dissolved oxygen and NO3- in drylands. These findings highlight the ecosystem function of ponds in agricultural watersheds, and provide new ideas on pollution control and global nitrogen cycling.					Camp, Huub J.M.

However, it remains unclear how and to what extent, lack of access to deep root water uptake will affect the water balance, growth and production of trees in water-limited ecosystems. To address this gap, we designed a novel experiment to partition soils and roots below 200 cm depth from higher layers in a dryland orchard on China's Loess Plateau to evaluate the response of apple (Malus pumila Mill.) trees to the lack of deep roots and access to deep soil resource in 2019 and 2020 (when a natural extreme drought occurred). We found that without partitioning apple trees clearly used deep soil water, thereby causing more soil desiccation than partitioned trees, especially during the drought. The unavailability of deep soil water resulted in much greater water stress, which cause a decrease of 36 % in transpiration, 20 % in photosynthesis rate and 32 % in mid-day leaf water potential relative to unpartitioned trees. Consequently, the yield and quality of apple trees also clearly decreased 11 % and 15 %. These findings suggest that the absence of uptake of deep soil water by roots reduced trees' drought resistance. However, the partitioned trees had clearly higher water use efficiency (WUE) than the unpartitioned trees, although in both cases WUE was strongly reduced by the extreme drought. Our results demonstrate that deep soil resources and roots play key roles in trees' responses to drought, and are likely to play crucial roles in future ecosystem dynamics.

J	Williams, JD; Wuest, SB				Williams, J. D.; Wuest, S. B.			Minimum tillage and no-tillage winter wheat-summer fallow for low precipitation regions	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Dryland wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the principal crop grown on 3.35 million ha (8.28 million ac) of the semiarid Inland Pacific Northwest of the United States. In areas with less than 300 mm (12 in) of annual precipitation, challenges for wheat production are similar to those found in the Mediterranean region and Australia. Successful crop production depends on adequate precipitation capture and storage and weed control, which prove problematic under no-tillage (NT), the most effective soil conservation practice. Sweep-tillage (ST) is proposed as an equally effective conservation system, with local conventional wisdom saying that it produces higher yields than NT systems. A study established in 2006 and concluded in 2018 evaluated the performance of NT and ST winter wheat-summer fallow production systems. The null hypothesis for this research assumed no statistically significant differences in any of the soil and plant characteristics measured between NT and ST treatments. Sixteen 0.04 ha (0.10 ac) plots were established in a randomized complete block design, with two rotation entry points for a total of four treatment plots per year replicated in four blocks. Data were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model. The NT system produced significantly higher crop yields and higher precipitation use efficiencies than the ST system (NT 3.38 +/- 0.33, ST 2.66 +/- 0.27 Mg ha(-1) [NT 50 +/- 5, ST 40 +/- 4 bu ac(-1)]). Infiltration rates were higher and soil temperatures were lower in the NT system. The higher yields and lower soil temperatures in the NT system were unexpected and contrary to previous research conducted in this region.YY																			0022-4561	1941-3300				MAY-JUN	2021	76	3					246	255		10.2489/jswc.2021.00062	http://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jswc.2021.00062													WOS:000650125900007

Our aim was to test the hypothesis that roots of 2 years old peach trees intercropped with grass can extract deep soil water below a shallow lithic discontinuity, composed of a layer of pebbles in a powdery calcareous matrix and that hardens in dry conditions. A peach tree orchard was planted on a soil with an average 0.5 m deep lithic discontinuity. Soil water content was measured every fortnight on the row and the inter-row with a neutron probe every 0.2 m up to 3 m depth. The contribution of each soil layer to trees and grass transpiration was simulated with a dynamic water balance model. Results show that tree roots grew through the lithic discontinuity and accessed a water refilled soil layer beneath it only 2 years after plantation, whereas grass roots did not grow below 0.5 m. Soil water content decrease up to 2 m depth after the cessation of irrigation was analysed as the result of tree water uptake. Tree water uptake simulations showed that soil layers below 1 m can contribute up to 17% of the total water uptake of the 2 years old trees. Our results suggest that a lithic discontinuity such as the one in our study may not be an impediment to the perennial trees root growth allowing them to access deep soil water. This suggests that soils with such a lithic discontinuity may be suitable for dryland agroforestry in which deep soil water available to the trees may help in reducing competition for water.

To tackle soil degradation, soil management practices have been implemented in the study area. However, less attention has been given to the management of physical soil quality. Hence, the objective of this study is to evaluate soil physical properties of long-used cultivated lands. Twelve Land Mapping Units (LMUs) were identified by overlaying slope and soil maps. Twelve composite and 12 undisturbed soil samples were collected from the 12 LMUs, and soil physical properties analyzed. Soil bulk density varied from 1.22 g cm(-3) in LMU3 to 1.68 g cm(-3) in LMU4. Available water capacity ranged from 0.09 in LMU4 to 0.17 in LMU3. Stability index (SI) values ranged from a low of 3.58 at LUM10 to 62.5 at LMU3; stability quotient (SQ) values ranged from 79.4 at LMU9 to 2782.8 at LUM3. Highest and lowest soil crust index values were found to be 1.53 in LMU5 and 0.29 in LMU9. This study indicated that poor soil management practice in the study area has caused soil physical degradation. Therefore, this study provides insight into improved land management of long-used cultivated land in the semi-arid region of the study area and other similar environments.																			0272-3646	1930-0557				JUL 4	2019	40	4					323	338		10.1080/02723646.2019.1568148	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02723646.2019.1568148													WOS:000469401900002

Variation in yield, nutritive value and persistence-related traits	GRASS AND FORAGE SCIENCE												Perennial ryegrass (PRG, Lolium perenne L.) breeding effort in New Zealand (NZ) has increased since c. 1990, resulting in greater functional trait diversity (e.g. heading date, ploidy, and associated Epichloe endophyte strain) in commercial products. This study quantified the variation, associations and interactions in dry matter (DM) yield, nutritive value and persistence-related traits among commercial cultivar-endophyte combinations released between 1973 and 2012, as a basis for assessing gains in value being delivered to the pasture-based livestock industries. Twenty-four or 28 combinations were compared over 3 years in two trials in each of two regions: Waikato in northern NZ (dryland), and Canterbury in central eastern South Island (irrigated). Cultivar-endophyte combinations were sown in mixtures with white clover, and pastures were intensively grazed 8-11 times per year by dairy cows. Principal Component Analysis identified 4 distinct clusters for the DM yield variables and for metabolisable energy (ME) content in each of the four trials. A broadly-adapted group of three late-season flowering, AR37-infected diploids with NZ and Spanish breeding backgrounds dominated the highest-yielding clusters. Tetraploids dominated the high ME content clusters. Interactions with region were observed throughout the data set: the strongest of these was driven by endophyte strain effects in Waikato. High-yielding cultivar-endophyte combinations in these trials were also generally high-yielding in the standard cultivar merit testing system operated in New Zealand, as interpreted via the DairyNZ Forage Value Index. However, alignment was poorer for medium- and lower-yielding cultivar-endophyte combinations. Several implications for forage evaluation methods and end-user industries are identified.

Factors associated with small lungworm infections in heavily infected sheep in southeast South Australia	AUSTRALIAN VETERINARY JOURNAL												This field observational study describes the seasonal pattern of small lungworm infections under different grazing managements from August 2018 to March 2019. Live weight, lungworm and gastrointestinal nematode infection, as well as pasture type grazed and snail density, were measured at 5 farm visits. Across all visits and mobs, about one quarter to one half of sheep were positive for small lungworm, although prevalence was as low as 0% and as high as 78%. The density of the intermediate host molluscs was greater than 1600 snails/m(2) in irrigated perennial lucerne pasture when it was grazed ('Pasture A'), but was low (<300) in non-irrigated perennial pasture ('Pasture B') and non-irrigated forage crop ('Pasture C'). Overall, non-infected lambs had a similar live weight compared with the small lungworm infected lambs (mean difference -0.6 kg; 95% CI -1.6 to 0.2; P = 0.1). The odds ratio of small lungworm infection associated with a twofold increase in worm egg count was 1.7 (95% CI 1.1 to 2.7; P = 0.02). Rather than a distinct seasonal pattern of infection, we found that small lungworm can occur throughout the year, with prevalence most influenced by pasture type (irrigated vs dryland), grazing management and the population density of the intermediate hosts. Importantly, this study suggested that small lungworm infection did not reduce lamb live weights. It reinforced that to improve sheep productivity, well-established determinants of production, such as correct grazing management to optimise pasture quality and strategies to reduce infections with gastrointestinal nematodes, should be the priority of farm managers.

However, when assessing the effects of biocrusts on soil respiration, few studies have considered biocrusts in bare soil patches and shrub soil patches. A field experiment was performed with five simulated rainfall addition events (0, 5, 15, 25, and 40 mm) in shrub and bare soil patches in June (early growing season, EGS), July (middle growing season, MGS) and September (late growing season, LGS) in 2016 and 2017. Our objective was to examine whether biocrusts at shrub and bare soil patches have the same effect on soil respiration under altered rainfall regimes. The results showed that the removal of biocrusts from bare patches reduced soil respiration by 15 % after rainfall amounts of 5-40 mm and increased the subsurface soil temperature and decreased the soil moisture after various rainfall treatments. However, in shrub patches, the removal of biocrusts led to a significant increase in soil respiration of 57 % and subsequent increases in subsurface soil temperature and moisutre. The discrepancy in the soil respiration response between the two types of patches might be attributable to the increase in soil infiltration after biocrust removal, with a greater stimulating increase in soil carbon emissions stimulated in the shrub patches than in the bare patches due to more the greater amounts of roots distributed under the former shrub patches. Our results indicate that the destruction of biocrusts in shrub patches may reduce the ability of biocrust ecosystems to become a net carbon sinks, with potentially negative consequences for ecosystem function and sustainability in water-limited regions.

The objective of the present work was to study how plant-available Si in highly calcareous soil with different soil chemical properties, amendments and growing conditions can affect Si absorption by Hordeum vulgare L. (Barley) and its biomass. Barley was cultivated under field conditions in dryland agriculture. Three treatments were compared: phytolithic biochar, compost pellets and no amendment. Greenhouse trials with the same soil and treatments were also carried out to achieve a better understanding of the dynamics in the soil-plant system under controlled growing conditions. In both experiments, physical and chemical soil and plant parameters were determined from collected samples. Results showed that the Si uptake and biomass in soils with the highest available Si (33 +/- 1 mg kg(-1)) was 4.7-fold and 2.4-fold higher, respectively, than in soils with the lowest available Si (22 +/- 1 mg kg(-1)). Also, with greater Si uptake there was an increase in N uptake (tau = 0.68, p < 0.01). Therefore, Si could improve N use efficiency within the plant. A strategy to improve Si values would be to use organic amendments that are enriched with Si and supply N in a form other than ammonium (NH4+). A high pH in this type of soil produces dissolution of the biogenic Si pool and low electrical conductivity values improve plant-available Si values. It is important to increase plant-available Si in highly calcareous soils as this has important implications for improving barley production.

We used a combination of the forest canopy density model, carbon conversion and socio-economic related data to analyze land cover classes in the periods of 1999-2003, 2003-2009, and 2009-2018, representing the phases of several years before community forestry permit, initial phase of community forestry establishment and several years after community forestry permit, respectively. Results showed that at baseline (1999), where illegal logging was started on the ground, the condition of the 40 ha investigated area was dominated by non-forest in the form of open land by 54% with an amounted carbon storage of 1352.62 ton. In the phase of before community forestry permit (1999-2003), when there was continuous illegal logging, the open land rise quickly achieved to 83%, with only 312.09 ton of carbon storage remaining. In the initial phase of community forestry establishment (2003-2009), when the government issued a legalization of community forest, the mixed dryland agriculture shifted to dominate the area by 55%, with the carbon storage being increased to 1840.94 ton. The last phase, several years after community forestry permit (2009-2018), which characterized by active engagement of the community in forest rehabilitation, the area was altered to fully stocked teak plantation forest by 82%, with a carbon storage enhancement of 3379.16 ton or two times higher than that at baseline. Such results are important for the forest community authority and related stakeholder for designing appropriate forest-related policies and supporting REDD + implementation.

Therefore, the appropriate creation of risk maps is critical for mitigating shallow landslide disasters. The first task to be done was to evaluate the vulnerability of shallow landslides based on a machine learning model (random forest (RF), a support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (Log)), and a physical model (SINMAP) in the loess tableland area. By comparing the differences, the best method for evaluating the vulnerability of shallow landslide was selected. The nonlinear response relationship between shallow landslides and environmental factors was quantified based on the frequency ratio. Multicollinearity analysis was used to identify 10 factors that were applied on ML to construct the spatial distribution model. The SINMAP model used a DEM and soil physical parameters to determine the stability coefficient of the study area. The results showed that (1) shallow landslides in Dongzhiyuan mainly occurred on shady slopes with an elevation of 1068-1249 m, a slope gradient of 36 degrees-60 degrees and a concave shape. The stream power and stream transport indexes increased with increasing rainfall erosion, making shallow landslides likely. The susceptibility of shallow landslides changed parabolically with the change in the NDVI and mainly occurred in grassland and shrubland. (2) The four methods performed similarly in predicting the sensitivity of shallow landslides. The high-incidence areas were on both sides of eroded gully slopes. The tableland and gully bottom areas were not prone to shallow landslides. (3) The highest area under the curve (AUC) values were generated from the RF training and validation datasets of 0.92 and 0.93, respectively, followed by SVM AUC values of 0.91 and 0.92, respectively; Log AUC values of 0.91 and 0.89, respectively, and the SINMAP model AUC values of 0.69 and 0.74, respectively. In conclusion, the RF model best predicted the susceptibility of shallow landslides in the study area. The results provide a scientific basis for disaster mitigation on the Loess Plateau.

Currently, little is known about the relative importance of precipitation, biocrust succession, and shrub cover in mediating soil P transformation. Here, we conducted a broad field survey across deserts in Northern China to investigate the roles of these factors in soil organic P (Po) mineralisation. We examined various P mineralisation parameters, including soil C:P ratio, soil Po content, bioavailable P, alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-encoding gene phoD abundance, and ALP activity. Additionally, we investigated the diversity and composition of soil phoD-harbouring communities and their relationships with Po mineralisation. Overall, the P mineralisation parameters increased with biocrust succession, and their responses to precipitation levels varied and were contingent upon the biocrust successional stages, while less significant differences were observed between the presence and absence of shrub cover. Most P mineralisation parameters were positively correlated within individual deserts or across all deserts studied. Moreover, the beta diversity, rather than the alpha diversity, of soil phoD-harbouring communities predominantly drove Po mineralisation. The abundance of certain genera (Actinoplanes and Micromonospora) that were relatively less dominant but showed significant positive correlations with P mineralisation parameters. By highlighting biocrust succession as the key determinant of soil Po mineralisation, the significance of precipitation and biocrust succession on phoD-harbouring communities, as well as the prevalence of community beta diversity in driving soil Po mineralisation, this study provides novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the transformation of Po into bioavailable P in biocrust systems.

Global environmental changes are expected to impact terrestrial ecosystems, including biocrust communities. Thus, a growing number of studies have focused on investigating the diversity of biocrust-forming organisms including cyanobacteria. Despite the increasing interest in understanding biocrust cyanobacteria, there are still several knowledge gaps, particularly in areas from South America, where studies are limited. Here, we studied the composition, abundance, and environmental drivers of cyanobacterial biocrust from two important biomes in Brazil, i.e. Caatinga and Pampa, which are subject to desertification and anthropogenic pressures, respectively. Ten samples at three sites were explored at each biome (n = 60) and cyanobacterial biocrust community composition and diversity was analyzed through morphological evaluation and Next Generation Sequencing targeting the 16S rRNA gen. Soil and climatic variables, e.g. organic matter, soil texture, nitrogen and phosphorus content, temperature, and solar irradiance, were also determined at each site. Our results showed that biocrust cyanobacteria had distinct taxonomic compositions and assemblages at each biome. Similarly, cyanobacterial composition across sites within each biome differed substantially. Soil temperature and pH were identified as the main factors explaining such biotic structures. Caatinga sites, characterized by more arid environments, presented a higher abundance of N-fixing cyanobacteria, e.g. Scytonema. In contrast, Pampa, with higher rainfall regimes, showed a larger abundance of biocrust-forming bacteria such as Microcoleus and Leptolyngbya. The outcomes of this research are expected to provide a basis to enhance biocrusts and conservation efforts and promote the use of biocrust cyanobacteria as global change indicators.

J	Jose, S; Nameer, PO				Jose, Sanjo; Nameer, P. O.			The expanding distribution of the Indian Peafowl (<i>Pavo cristatus</i>) as an indicator of changing climate in Kerala, southern India: A modelling study using MaxEnt	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Avian species can be regarded as a bioindicator of environmental change. However, limited analysis are available on the effect of climate change on the distribution of birds in India. During recent years the distribution of the Indian Peafowl, (Pavo cristatus), a dryland species was observed to be expanding in Kerala, southern India, a region falling under the humid tropics. A study was conducted to understand the reasons for this expanding distribution, the influence of climatic variables and the future extent of distribution using MaxEnt. A Mean ensemble of five CMIP5 models were used to predict the potential distribution for the period 2050s (2041-2060) and 2070s (2061-2080) under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. The study identified that seasonality of temperature and precipitation during the driest quarter will be the major factors which determine the distribution of P. cristatus. The model showed that in current conditions 19.15% of the study area provides a suitable habitat for P. cristatus, whilst future predictions suggest that there may be a range expansion of 41.44% and 55.33% during the 2050s under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. In the 2070s, area of habitat range may decline to 22.09% and 32.22% under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. Comparison of various RCP scenarios showed high habitat suitability under RCP 8.5. Central Kerala is found to be the hotspot for the Indian Peafowl population expansion and the distribution may be prominent towards southeast and northwest during the 2050s and 2070s respectively. The study reveals that the Indian Peafowl acts as a bioindicator of the changing climate in Kerala.

J	Nery, T; Polyakov, M; Sadler, R; White, B				Nery, Thayse; Polyakov, Maksym; Sadler, Rohan; White, Ben			Spatial patterns of boom and bust forestry investment development: A case study from Western Australia	LAND USE POLICY												Land use policies interact with biophysical and socioeconomic characteristics to determine land use and land cover (LULC) changes. This paper presents a method for assessing the determinants of plantation land use transitions from 1979 to 2014 from Landsat data for the Warren River Catchment (4,416 km(2)) in Western Australia. This catchment is intrinsically interesting because it is a frontier between agriculture, high biodiversity native forests and commercial forest plantations. Further land use policies have had a strong bearing on LULC. Initial forest clearing in the catchment was the result of agricultural development policy. It was followed by the ban on clearing native vegetation on private land in 1978. The Management Investment Scheme introduced in the 1990s led to a rapid increase in the area of plantation forest on agricultural land. The catchment has two significant environmental problems: first dryland salinity leading to land degradation and the salinization of rivers and streams; and second the protection of high levels of endemic biodiversity. LULC changes from 1979 to 2014 reveal that soil depth, distance to urban centres, surrounding land use, and private land are positively correlated with transitions to plantation forest. The Management Investment Scheme brought the largest changes in LULC as land transitioned into Eucalyptus plantations in the 1990s when the tax incentives were introduced and then gradually out of plantations by clear-felling and conversion to agriculture as tax benefits for the scheme were reformulated and uncertainty about the policy increased. Other evidence on policy effects are that the Forest Management Plans have sustained the area of native forest and the ban on clearing has been effective.

Aims We investigated the effects of reduced nitrogen application with simultaneous full straw return on carbon input, aggregate size distribution, aggregate-associated organic carbon and total nitrogen (TN), soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, SOC fractions, and crop yield. Methods A long-term field experiment was performed in the dryland region of Guanzhong. The study involved three nitrogen fertilizer (NF) amounts: 337.5 (conventional NF, CNF), 286.4 (15%NF reduction, 15%RNF), and 236.3 (30%NF reduction, 30%RNF) kg N ha(-1) y(-1) with full straw return. Results Compared with CNF, 30%RNF increased the content of soil organic carbon by 5.7% and increased maize yield by 13.1%, under straw return conditions. The 30%RNF + straw application treatment promoted the formation of large macro-aggregates more effectively than CNF application. The 30%RNF + straw treatment significantly increased SOC by 10.6% and 4.7%, respectively, in large and small macroaggregates relative to conventional NF. Moreover, the 30%RNF + straw treatment resulted in a significant increase in the SOC content in the density fractions of mineral soil organic matter (mSOM) for both small and large macro-aggregates. This treatment also resulted in a significant increase in the content of TN in the mSOM and density fractions of particulate matter that had coarse and fine intra-aggregates of the large macro-aggregates. Conclusion Full straw return with reduced nitrogen (N) application could be a promising option to improve the structure of soil aggregates, soil organic carbon, and nitrogen sequestration.																			1436-8730	1522-2624				FEB	2022	185	1					87	97		10.1002/jpln.202100062	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.202100062		NOV 2021											WOS:000720780100001
J	Li, JG; Tooth, S; Zhang, K; Zhao, Y				Li, Jiaguang; Tooth, Stephen; Zhang, Kun; Zhao, Yang			Visualisation of flooding along an unvegetated, ephemeral river using Google Earth Engine: Implications for assessment of channel-floodplain dynamics in a time of rapid environmental change	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Given rapid environmental change, the development of new, data-driven, interdisciplinary approaches is essential for improving assessment and management of river systems, especially with respect to flooding. In the world's extensive drylands, difficulties in obtaining field observations of major hydrological events mean that remote sensing techniques are commonly used to map river floods and assess flood impacts. Such techniques, however, are dependent on available cloud-free imagery during or immediately after peak discharge, and single images may omit important flood-related hydrogeomorphological events. Here, we combine multiple Landsat images from Google Earth Engine (GEE) with precipitation datasets and high-resolution (<0.65 m) satellite imagery to visualise flooding and assess the associated channel-floodplain dynamics along a 25 km reach of the unvegetated, ephemeral Rio Colorado, Bolivia. After cloud and shadow removal, Landsat surface reflectance data were used to calculate the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and map flood extents and patterns. From 2004 through 2016, annual flooding area along the narrow (<30 m), shallow (<1.7 m), finegrained (dominantly silt/clay) channels was positively correlated (R-2 = 0.83) with 2-day maximum precipitation totals. Rapid meander bend migration, bank erosion, and frequent overbank flooding was associated with formation of crevasse channels, splays, and headward-eroding channels, and with avulsion (shifting of flow from one channel to another). These processes demonstrate ongoing, widespread channel-floodplain dynamics despite low stream powers and cohesive sediments.

Soil water-stable aggregates, microbial biomass and enzyme activity play key roles in soil fertility and quality. However, the impact of plant structure on soil water-stable aggregates, microbial biomass and enzyme activity remain unclear despite their importance for sustainable ecological agriculture. In this study, the effects of three traditional plant types (Triticum aestivum (TA), Zea mays (ZM) and Solanum tuberosum (ST)) and two novel economic plant types (Malus domestica (MD) and intercropped field (Solarium tuberosum and Malus domestica, SM)) were evaluated on similar terraces of the Loess Plateau. We investigated the water-stable soil aggregation, microbial biomass and enzyme activity and attempted to determine their contributions to the quality of terraced soils, examined the links on Loess Plateau terraces. Our results showed that the different plant types had significant effects on soil quality. The total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) contents, mean weight diameter (MWD) and geometric mean diameter (GMD) values, and invertase, urease and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) levels were highest in the SM samples and were lowest in the ST samples. Growing apples instead of traditional crops significantly improved the availability of soil nutrients, soil water-stable aggregates, microbial biomass and enzyme activity. Soil organic carbon (SOC), soil moisture, ammonium nitrogen and pH were identified as the primary factors affecting the water-stable soil aggregate and microbial activity characteristics across all plant types in the dryland terraces of Loess Plateau. These observations indicate that scientifically-driven land management could be used to increase soil structural stability and could have a distinct impact on the soil nutrients and biological characteristics.					wu, jialin/JPY-4408-2023; Abbas, Fakher/HLW-6894-2023; LI, SHA/JNR-9956-2023; LI, XIAO/JCE-6169-2023	ABBAS, FAKHER/0000-0002-1989-2067													0929-1393	1873-0272				MAR	2021	159								103819	10.1016/j.apsoil.2020.103819	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2020.103819		JAN 2021											WOS:000609456600014

Streamflow partitioning using the Budyko framework in a northern glaciated watershed under drought to deluge conditions	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												We use the Budyko framework to examine streamflow changes due to climate variation and human activities in the Mauvais Coulee Basin, a 1002 km(2) sub-basin that contributes streamflow to Devils Lake, a terminal lake that has experienced catastrophic flooding over the past three decades. The basin lies within the northern glaciated prairies, contains innumerable wetland complexes that follow fill-spill hydrological principles, has undergone extensive land use change to support dryland farming, and has experienced a drought to deluge hydroclimatic transition over the last century. We implement the Budyko framework to partition the runoff increase to the lake between its climatic or human components. Initial results attribute 45% of the streamflow increase to climate factors, and 55% to human activities. Implementation of the Budyko framework to examine streamflow partitioning, however, rests upon a series of assumptions that are usually not directly verified. We then examine each Budyko framework assumption to determine its suitability for our study site and study period. None of the required assumptions are fully satisfied. Our study site and study period encompass two distinct hydroclimatic modes, contain no clear single inflection point separating baseline and altered periods, experience root zone soil moisture storage changes during the study period, and exhibit a non-stationary precipitation-streamflow relationship during the transitional period between the two hydroclimatic modes. Streamflow attribution produced by the standard application of the Budyko framework is not applicable to our study site or study period. We recommend that local-scale investigations of streamflow partitioning based upon the Budyko framework be more intentional in verifying model assumptions as a standard practice in implementing the method.

Assessing the Adaptability of Quinoa and Millet in Two Agroecological Zones of Rwanda	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS												Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) and millet species (including Eleusine coracana, Panicum miliaceum, and Setaria italica) are nutritionally valuable seed crops with versatile applications in food production and consumption. Both quinoa and millet have the potential to provide drought-tolerant, nutritious complementary crops to maize that is predominantly cultivated in Rwanda. This study evaluated quinoa and millet genotypes and assessed their agronomic performance in two agroecological zones of Rwanda. Twenty quinoa and fourteen millet cultivars were evaluated for grain yield, emergence, days to heading, flowering, and maturity, and plant height in 2016 and 2017 in Musanze, a highland region (2,254 m above sea level), and Kirehe, in the Eastern lowlands of Rwanda (1,478 m above sea level). Quinoa yield ranged from 189 to 1,855 kg/ha in Musanze and from 140 to 1,259 kg/ha in Kirehe. Millet yield ranged from 16 to 1,536 kg/ha in Musanze and from 21 to 159 kg/ha in Kirehe. Mean cultivar plant height was shorter in Kirehe (mu = 73 and 58 cm for quinoa and millets, respectively), than Musanze (mu = 93 and 76 cm for quinoa and millets, respectively). There was a genotype x environment interaction for maturity in quinoa and millet in both years. Across locations, "Titicaca" and "Earlybird" (Panicum miliaceum) were the earliest maturing quinoa and millet varieties, respectively, both with an average of 91 days to maturity. The results suggest that quinoa and millet have potential as regional crops for inclusion in the traditional dryland cropping rotations in Rwanda, thereby contributing to increased cropping system diversity and food security.

J	You, Y; Zhou, N; Wang, YD				You, Yuan; Zhou, Na; Wang, Yongdong			Comparative study of desertification control policies and regulations in representative countries of the Belt and Road Initiative	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Desertification threatens land integrity, hinders the improvement of livelihoods, restricts global economic development, and affects social stability. The countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road Initiative have long suffered from varying degrees of desertification, land degradation and drought, and experience the most severe desertification of anywhere on the planet. Existing research on desertification has mainly focused on technical aspects of this problem and on sand control and management. Most studies have covered topics such as dryland, forestry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and water and soil conservation. However, few studies have been conducted from the perspective of public policy. In particular, policies and regulations for the prevention and control of desertification in countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative remain poorly understood and undervalued. This study therefore examined policies and regulations for preventing and controlling desertification in re-presentative Belt and Road countries. The developmental context, formulation of measures to safeguard the environment, modes and effects of their implementation, and the overall management systems in these countries were analyzed, and their similarities, differences, and correlations were explored in depth. The findings of the study will provide inputs for promoting cooperation among industries, enterprises, and institutions in typical desertified countries, whose collaborative efforts will contribute to promoting green development within the Belt and Road Initiative. Moreover, they will provide a reference for researchers, policy makers, and environmental regulators to shape the next generation of desertification control policies and regulations and to support environmentally sustainable implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative.(c) 2021 The Author(s).

J	Dial, RJ; Schulz, B; Lewis-Clark, E; Martin, K; Andersen, HE				Dial, Roman J.; Schulz, Bethany; Lewis-Clark, Eric; Martin, Kaili; Andersen, Hans-Erik			Using fractal self-similarity to increase precision of shrub biomass estimates	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												We show that aerial tips are self-similar fractals of whole shrubs and present a field method that applies this fact to improves accuracy and precision of biomass estimates of tall-shrubs, defined here as those with diameter at root collar (DRC) >= 2.5 cm. Power function allometry of biomass to stem diameter generates a disproportionate prediction error that increases rapidly with diameter. Thus, biomass should be modeled as a single measure of stem diameter only if stem diameter is less than a threshold D-max. When stem diameter exceeds D-max, then the stem internode should be treated as a conic frustrum requiring two additional measures: a second, node-adjacent diameter and a length. If the second diameter is less than D-max, then the power function allometry can be applied to the aerial tip; otherwise an additional internode is measured. This "two-component" allometry-internodes as frustra and aerial tips as shrubs-can reduce estimated biomass error propagated to the plot-level by as much as 50% or more where very large shrubs are present D-max is any diameter such that the ratio of single-component to two-component uncertainty exceeds the ratio of two-component to single-component measurement time. Guidelines for estimating D-max based on pilot field data are provided. Tall shrubs are increasing in abundance and distribution across Arctic, alpine, boreal, and dryland ecosystems. Estimating their biomass is important for both ecological studies and carbon accounting. Reducing field-sample prediction error increases precision in multi-stage modeling because additional measures efficiently improve plot-level biomass precision, reducing uncertainty for shrub biomass estimates.

J	Li, MX; Wu, PL; Sexton, DMH; Ma, ZG				Li, Mingxing; Wu, Peili; Sexton, David M. H.; Ma, Zhuguo			Potential shifts in climate zones under a future global warming scenario using soil moisture classification	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Climate zones fundamentally shape the patterns of the terrestrial environment and human habitation. How global warming alters their current distribution is an important question that has yet to be properly addressed. Using root-layer soil moisture as an indicator, this study investigates potential future changes in climate zones with the perturbed parameter ensemble of climate projections by the HadGEM3-GC3.05 model under the CMIP5 RCP8.5 scenario. The total area of global drylands (including arid, semiarid, and subhumid zones) can potentially expand by 10.5% (ensemble range is 0.6-19.0%) relative to the historical period of 1976-2005 by the end of the 21st century. This global rate of dryland expansion is smaller than the estimate using the ratio between annual precipitation total and potential evapotranspiration (19.2%, with an ensemble range of 6.7-33.1%). However, regional expansion rates over the mid-high latitudes can be much greater using soil moisture than using atmospheric indicators alone. This result is mainly because of frozen soil thawing and accelerated evapotranspiration with Arctic greening and polar warming, which can be detected in soil moisture but not from atmosphere-only indices. The areal expansion consists of 7.7% (-8.3 to 23.6%) semiarid zone growth and 9.5% (3.1-20.0%) subhumid growth at the expense of the 2.3% (-10.4 to 7.4%) and 12.6% (-29.5 to 2.0%) contraction of arid and humid zones. Climate risks appear in the peripheries of subtype zones across drylands. Potential alteration of the traditional humid zone, such as those in the mid-high latitudes and the Amazon region, highlights the accompanying vulnerability for local ecosystems.

We examined long-term patterns in soil organic matter (SOM) against both climate and prescribed fire in a Chihuahuan Desert grassland in central New Mexico, USA. SOM concentration was estimated by loss-on-ignition from soils at 0-20 cm depth each spring and fall for 25 years (1989-2014) in unburned desert grassland and from 2003 to 2014 following a prescribed fire. SOM concentration did not have a long-term trend but fluctuated seasonally at both burned and unburned sites, ranging from a minimum of 0.9% to a maximum of 3.3%. SOM concentration declined nonlinearly in wet seasons and peaked in dry seasons. These long-term results contrast not only with the positive relationships between aboveground net primary production and precipitation for this region, but also with previous reports that wetter sites have more SOM across drylands globally, suggesting that space is not a good substitute for time in predicting dryland SOM dynamics. We suggest that declines in SOM in wet periods are caused by increased soil respiration, runoff, leaching, and/or soil erosion. In addition to tracking natural variability in climate, SOM concentration also decreased 14% following prescribed fire, a response that magnified over time and has persisted for nearly a decade due to the slow recovery of primary production. Our results document the surprisingly dynamic nature of soil organic matter and its high sensitivity to climate and fire in a dry grassland ecosystem characteristic of the southwestern USA.

Climate and land-cover dynamics upstream are, however, threatening runoff response reaching these spate systems. The objective of this study was thus to analyse the hydrological response of dryland catchments to changing climate and land cover in Guguf spate systems. Thirty-six years of climate data were analysed using Mann-Kendall, Pettitt's test and linear regression methods, and time-series land-cover information extracted from Landsat satellite images in a remote-sensing interface. The Soil Conservation Systems curve number method was then employed to formulate the likely impact of climate and land-cover changes on runoff response, and trends analysed. Results showed that temperature, evapotranspiration and rainfall varied at least by 0.11 degrees C, 15.2 mm and -5.1 mm yr(-1) respectively, intensifying moisture stress. Moreover, improving vegetation cover in the highlands enhanced the water-abstraction capacity of the soil, impeding the runoff curve number by 9.2%. Thus, the combined effects of climate induced moisture stress and land cover led water abstraction upstream has threatened runoff response at a rate of 0.23 x 10(6) m(3) yr(-1). In other words, the runoff response reaching Guguf spate systems degenerated by 7.96 x 10(6) m(3) over 36 years. Such unusual highland-lowland hydrological linkage has therefore endangered the availability of surplus water to irrigate spate-based farms downstream. Appropriate policies and strategies would therefore be desirable to address conflicting interests in scarce water resources in the face of climate change. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Inoculant, nitrogen and phosphorus improves photosynthesis and water-use efficiency in soybean production	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE												Soybean yield within the Southern Africa falls below its potential despite similar climatic conditions across some agroecologies, replicable agronomic management practices and introduced improved varieties. Understanding physiological processes and water-use efficiency (WUE) of soybean offer information on bridging this yield gap. A field study was conducted in 2017 and 2018 seasons in two agroecologies (Angonia and Ruace) in Mozambique to evaluate the effects of Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens strain USDA110 formerly known as Bradyrhizobium japonicum inoculant, nitrogen and phosphorus on nodulation, physiology and yield of non-promiscuous (Safari) and promiscuous (TGx 1740-2F) soybean varieties. Data on transpiration, photosynthesis, leaf area index, radiation interception and WUE from the beginning of flowering to maturity were collected. Transpiration rate varied considerably with interaction between locations, growth stages, varieties and treatments. At podding, phosphorus-treated soybean at Angonia transpired less (6.3 mmol/m(2)/s) than check plants (6.6 mmol/m(2)/s). Photosynthesis rate and WUE were distinct with variety, growth stages and inputs within agroecologies. For instance, in Angonia 2018 season, phosphorus fertilized TGx 1740-2F photosynthesized more at flowering (25.3 mu mol/m(2)/s) while the lowest was phosphorus-treated Safari at podding with 17.2 mu mol/m(2)/s. At the same site in 2017, inoculated soybean photosynthesized more at 22.8 mu mol/m(2)/s leading to better WUE of 3.6 that corresponded to 2894 kg/ha yield. Overall, soybean WUE was higher when inoculated than N-treated, while P application yielded better. Results from this study will complement breeders' effort in developing phosphorus efficient varieties suited for a wide range of changing climatical conditions.

SCIENCE BULLETIN												The Loess Plateau of China (LP) has the largest and thickest loess deposits in the world. Quantifying the amount of loess in the LP is crucial for investigating the accumulation and erosion of loess, and determining the regional soil and water resource capacity. We used loess thickness data, a pedotransfer function for bulk density (BD), and the clay content data observed in 242 sites across the LP to derive the BD of loess and then estimate the loess mass and its distribution across the LP. The results indicated that the average BD of loess between the surface and bedrock is 1.58 g cm(-3), varying from 1.18 to 1.87 g cm(-3). The total loess mass is approximately 5.45 x 10(13) t, and the average loess mass over an area of 1 m(2) is 169 t, ranging from 1.36 to 585 t. The greatest mass of loess is in the south-central of the LP while the lowest mass of loess is in the northwest and river valley areas. Our estimate of loess mass provides key data for calculating water, carbon, and nutrient storages in the LP, which improves our understanding of soil-water processes and ecohydrological systems in this landscape.

Increasing wheat proteins sustainably by rotation with forage legumes	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												Wheat proteins provide around 20% of all human dietary protein, but their end-use qualities are determined by the form and quantity of nitrogen in the endosperm. In the developed world, there is a heavy reliance in grain production on nitrogen supplied from synthetic fertilisers, and this fertiliser can contribute up to 50% of the on-farm emissions of greenhouse gasses in agriculture. However, despite increasing rates of application of synthetic nitrogen to cereals, wheat grain protein levels, in developed nations, have been frequently failing to reach the premium grade required by the bread-making market. Here, for the first time, we report that biological nitrogen fixation from a new generation of hardseeded annual forage legumes, when grown in rotation with cereal crops, can replace fertiliser N without compromising grain protein. The forage legumes were grown in rotation with Triticum aestivum, and compared with rotations that included a fallow, or a cereal crop at three rainfed sites in Western Australia with differing soil types for 2-4 years. The wheat received low, medium and high rates of urea to indicate if forage legumes can provide sufficient nitrogen for sustainable wheat production. At all sites and years studied, we discovered that cereal grains produced following a year of forage legumes had significantly higher protein levels than when grown as part of a continuous cereal rotation. These results were achieved in combination with a reduction in on-farm emissions (by over 200 kg/ha of CO2) without compromising yield as indicated by emissions accounting. Including appropriate forage legumes in farming systems allows production of low emission intensity grain proteins in dryland farming.

Intercropping	AGRICULTURE-BASEL												The soil microbial community is not only driven by plant composition but is also disturbed by the soil environment. Intercropping affects the soil microenvironment through plant interaction, but the understanding of the relationship between soil microbial community and environment in intercropping is still weak. In this study, milk vetch intercropping with rapeseed was used to explore the interaction between soil microorganisms and environment. The results showed that the soil moisture content of intercropping was higher than that of monoculture during the reproductive period of rapeseed growth (flowering and podding stages). The contents of soil total nitrogen and alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen in intercropping were higher than those in monoculture. The dominant soil microbial communities in intercropping were the same as in monoculture and included Chloroflexi, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Gemmatimonates and Bacteroidetes. However, intercropping increased the Shannon index and decreased the Simpson's index of the soil microbial community. The changes in the soil microbial community were mainly related to soil temperature, moisture, pH, total nitrogen, alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen and available potassium. Moreover, there was a negative correlation between soil moisture and microorganisms and a positive correlation between nitrogen and microorganisms. Thus, milk vetch-rapeseed intercropping could not only improve soil nitrogen content, but also change soil microbial community diversity. In dryland red soil, the effect of milk vetch-rapeseed intercropping on soil moisture and nitrogen was the key factor contributing to the changes in the soil microbial community. When planting rapeseed in the future, we could consider the application of intercropping with milk vetch, which can contribute to regulating the soil nitrogen pool and improving microbial diversity.																				2077-0472				OCT	2022	12	10							1538	10.3390/agriculture12101538	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12101538													WOS:000872025100001

However, effects of biochar application on soil nitrogen balance under dryland conditions have not been assessed. In this study, we applied biochar at four rates [no biochar (B0), 5 t ha(-1) (B5), 10 t ha(-1 )(B10), and 20 t ha(-1) (B20)] to a rainfed winter-wheat agroecosystem on the Loess Plateau in China in October 2011 and 2016. Biochar application at the low and medium rates (5 and 10 t ha(-1)) reduced nitrogen losses through NH3 volatilization and N2O emissions by 9.23-15.41 % and 2.77-10.44 %, respectively, in all the three experimental study seasons from 2016 to 2019. In addition, biochar application reduced soil NO3-N leaching by 14.71-37.96 % within 100 cm soil depth in a dose-dependent manner. The reduced nitrogen losses increased the retention of soil total nitrogen in the 0-60 cm soil layer (particularly in the 0-20 cm layer). Biochar application increased the crop and grain nitrogen uptake by 5.07-17.77 % and 1.73-21.74 %, respectively, and this effect was more pronounced at higher biochar application rates (10 and 20 t ha(-1)). Estimation of N inputs and outputs indicated that biochar application significantly (P < 0.05) increased the mean soil nitrogen balance by 52.09-116.84 % through decreased nitrogen losses and increased soil nitrogen retention. The results indicate that biochar application at 10 t ha(-1) could be recommended as the optimal dose for sustainable nitrogen management in rainfed wheat cropping ecosystems on the Loess Plateau.

Low nitrogen use efficiency of dual-purpose crops: Causes and cures	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Dual-purpose crops are grazed during the vegetative phase by cattle, goats and sheep in many dryland farming systems. After grazing, these crops continue to grow until maturity when they are harvested for grain. The process of grazing depletes crop nitrogen (N) content. Yield and grain protein concentration may therefore be more N-limited in grazed than in grain-only crops. This paper reviews 14 field experiments in south-eastern Australia, 12 of which were on farms, to measure the responses to N fertilizer by wheat, barley or canola crops defoliated by mowing or grazing with sheep. In five experimental comparisons of defoliated and grain-only crops, the average nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of fertilizer N applied soon after defoliation, as is typically practiced, was 18 %, while NUE of grain-only crops fertilized at the same time and N-rate was 41 %. Applying N fertilizer to defoliated crops at this stage was usually unprofitable. In one experiment comparing responses of grazed and grain-only crops to time of N application post-grazing, a delay of two weeks after grazing increased yield of grain-only crops and NUE of both grazed and grain-only crops, compared with application soon after grazing. Our explanation of these results is the low N demand by small, defoliated crops and increased N demand as they regrew after defoliation. Additional evidence for the N-demand explanation came from a positive relationship between NUE of grazed crops and the yield of grain-only crops. The results suggest that delaying N application for two weeks after grazing and retaining more biomass after grazing can increase N demand, yield and NUE of grazed crops.

Variable soil water, precocious germination and emergence, and the presence of soil fungal pathogens often reduce plant establishment. Novel restoration treatments that increase soil water during early forb life stages, delay germination and emergence to coincide with favorable spring conditions, and reduce mortality from soil fungal pathogens may benefit native forb restoration. We compared the efficacy of three novel treatments-snow fencing, plant protection fabric, and seed coatings-to improve establishment of a forb species native to the Great Basin, basalt milkvetch (Astragalus filipes Torr. ex A. Gray). We replicated treatments plus a notreatment control at three sites in the Great Basin in a randomized complete block design over 2 yr. To evaluate the efficacy of our restoration treatments, we measured germination, seedling emergence, establishment, and second-yr survival. The effects of snow fencing and plant protection fabric varied by site and life stage and were likely influenced by thewet spring conditions across sites, particularly the two northern sites. Snow fencing increased establishment and second-yr survival at one site. Plant protection fabric did not benefit any life stage at any site. Seed coatings increased seedling emergence at all sites but did not affect establishment or survival. Overall, second-yr survival remained low across all sites and treatments. Our study indicates that our treatments can positively affect basalt milkvetchemergence, establishment, and survival, but additional management actions are needed to improve long-term restoration success of native forbs.

Assessment of aquifer recharge and groundwater availability in a semiarid region of Brazil in the context of an interbasin water transfer scheme	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Particularly in arid and semiarid areas, more and more populations rely almost entirely on imported water. However, the extent to which intentional discharge into transiting river systems and unintentional leakage may be augmenting water resources for communities along and down gradient of the water transfer scheme has not previously been subject to research. The objective of this study was to assess both the potential of a large-scale water transfer (WT) scheme to increase groundwater availability by channel transmission losses in a large dryland aquifer system (2,166 km(2)) in Brazil, and the capability of the receiving streams to transport water downstream under a prolonged drought. An integrated surface-water/groundwater model was developed to improve the estimation of the groundwater resources, considering the spatio-temporal variability of infiltrated rainfall for aquifer recharge. Aquifer recharge from the WT scheme was simulated under prolonged drought conditions, applying an uncertainty analysis of the most influential fluxes and parameters. The annual recharge (66 mm/year) was approximately twice the amount of water abstracted (1990-2016); however, the annual recharge dropped to 13.9 mm/year from 2012 to 2016, a drought period. Under similar drought conditions, the additional recharge (6.89 x 106 m(3)/year) from the WT scheme did not compensate for the decrease in groundwater head in areas that do not surround the receiving streams. Actually, the additional recharge is counteracted by a decrease of 25% of natural groundwater recharge or an increase of 50% in pumping rate; therefore, WT transmission losses alone would not solve the issue of the unsustainable management of groundwater resources.

J	Guillen-Cruz, G; Flores-Renteria, D				Guillen-Cruz, Gabriela; Flores-Renteria, Dulce			Slight Temperature Increases Affect Soil Respiration Under Short-Term Incubation: a Study Case from Agricultural Fields from Cuatro Cienegas, Mexico	JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION												By the end of this century, climate change is forecast to increase the average global temperature by between 1.4 and 5.8 degrees C. The effects of climate change on dryland farming systems are complex and time-varying. There is no consensus on how temperature increase will affect soil functioning and carbon dynamics. Therefore, we want to know to what extent a slight increase in temperature influences the respiration rate of the agricultural soils of Cuatro Cienegas Basin (CCB). Soils from six agricultural fields in the CCB, northeastern Mexico, were incubated for 17 days at the mean growing season temperature (36.4 degrees C) and under two climate change scenarios (temperature increased by 1.5 and 3 degrees C), with temperature and relative humidity set for each scenario. Soil respiration, moisture, and temperature were determined every 3 days. Soil physicochemical properties were determined for each agricultural plot. The results show that for the 1.5 degrees C scenario, an increase in soil respiration (R-S) at the beginning of incubation attributed to a higher microbial community activity, thus resulting in a higher decomposition of organic matter rate. During the following incubation days, this activity decreased due to substrate depletion or microbial thermal adaptation. R-S also followed the same pattern of increase and decrease throughout the incubation period of the 3 degrees C scenario. The total release of CO2 from the soil increased in both climate change scenarios, especially at 1.5 degrees C. Under a global warming scenario, agricultural soils in the CCB are expected to lose more labile carbon (potentially 50-66% more C release), with a possible response of microbial acclimation.

These systems differ from agricultural irrigation methods since they only pursue the establishment of the planted seedlings instead of achieving good agricultural yields. They, therefore, involve very low irrigation doses compared to the usual irrigation doses found in the agricultural sector. These approaches are nonconventional localized irrigation systems with high efficiency in water application. Based on the water discharge equations they use, these methods can be classified into four groups: direct deep irrigation, irrigation through porous walls, irrigation with wicks, and irrigation with solar distillers. This paper describes a total of sixteen different systems suitable for afforestation. All the systems are compared with each other. To make the comparisons, four key parameters are considered: the cost of acquiring and installing the system, the water application efficiency, the maintenance of the system, and the possibility of irrigating several plants at the same time. The irrigation systems described in this review represent an important technical advance not only for dryland forestry but also for rainfed arboriculture, xeriscaping, and xerogardening. These systems make it possible to widely extend the planting period to almost throughout the year, not only in arid regions but also in less dry or even humid climates, especially when critical areas have to be afforested, including shallow, sandy, saline, or gypseous soils, suntraps, windy and desertified areas, open pit mines, and other areas. Seedling microirrigation is an emerging sector of the irrigation industry that is rapidly developing with new devices and patents. Two foreseeable future trends can be identified: the growing use of new permeable materials and the possibility of connecting individual emitters to irrigation lines.

Seedling defoliation may enhance survival of dominant wheatgrasses but not <i>Poa secunda</i> seeded for restoration in the sagebrush steppe of the Northern Great Basin	AOB PLANTS												Restoration of dryland ecosystems is often limited by low seedling establishment and survival. Defoliation caused by insects and small mammals could be an overlooked cause of seedling mortality. In the sagebrush steppe, we examined the effect of seedling defoliation on the survival of perennial grasses commonly used as restoration materials. Under field conditions, seedlings of three perennial bunchgrass species (non-native Agropyron cristatum, and native grasses Poe secunda and Pseudoroegneria spicata) were defoliated at two intensities (30 % and 70 % leaf length removal) and frequencies (one or two clippings) and compared to a non-defoliated control. Following emergence the first year, clippings occurred at the two-leaf stage; a second clipping occurred 1 month later for repeated defoliation treatments. We monitored seedling survival and tillering for 2 years. We expected higher defoliation intensity and frequency to reduce survival for all species, but only a few treatments reduced Po. secunda survival. Conversely, larger-statured Triticeae (wheatgrasses) benefited from some defoliation treatments. In both years, A. cristatum survival increased with repeated defoliation at both intensities. Defoliation did not affect Ps. spicata survival in the first year, but a single defoliation in the second year resulted in increased survival. In both A. cristatum and Ps. spicata, higher-intensity defoliation reduced the boost to survival resulting from defoliation frequency. Seedlings with more tillers had greater survival probabilities, but tiller number was unaffected by defoliation. Further research may elucidate mechanisms seedlings use to compensate for or benefit from defoliation. In the meantime, managers should aim to select defoliation-tolerant species if they anticipate herbivory will be problematic for restoration sites.

Microclimate-forage growth linkages across two strongly contrasting precipitation years in a Mediterranean catchment	ECOHYDROLOGY												Given the complex topography of California rangelands, contrasting microclimates affect forage growth at catchment scales. However, documentation of microclimate-forage growth associations is limited, especially in Mediterranean regions experiencing pronounced climate change impacts. To better understand microclimate-forage growth linkages, we monitored forage productivity and root-zone soil temperature and moisture (0-15 and 15-30 cm) in 16 topographic positions in a 10-ha annual grassland catchment in California's Central Coast Range. Data were collected through two strongly contrasting growing seasons, a wet year (2016-17) with 287-mm precipitation and a dry year (2017-18) with 123-mm precipitation. Plant-available soil water storage (0-30 cm) was more than half full for most of the wet year; mean peak standing forage was 2790 kg ha(-1) (range: 1597-4570 kg ha(-1)). The dry year had restricted plant-available water and mean peak standing forage was reduced to 970 kg ha(-1) (range: 462-1496 kg ha(-1)). In the wet year, forage growth appeared energy limited (light and temperature): warmer sites produced more forage across a 3-4 degrees C soil temperature gradient but late season growth was associated with moister sites spanning this energy gradient. In the dry year, the warmest topographic positions produced limited forage across a 10 degrees C soil temperature gradient until late season rainfall in March. Linear models accounting for interactions between soil moisture and temperature explained about half of rapid, springtime forage growth variance. These findings reveal dynamic but clear microclimate-forage growth linkages in complex terrain, and thus, have implications for rangeland drought monitoring and dryland ecosystems modeling under climate change.

This study provides a basinattempts to compare the formation's depositional model to those developed for distributive fluvial system (DFS) successions. This time interval is significant because it was a period of intense tectonic activity related to the Parana acute accent - dataset of 64 locations (comprising a total of 1070 m of stratigraphy). Four facies associations were identified: perennial fluvial channel fills, ephemeral fluvial channel fills, floodplain deposits, and aeolian deposits, indicating a dryland climate. Spatial trends were analyzed along a downstream-oriented transect (NNE-SSW) across the system. Grain size, channel-body thickness, number of stories, and bar thickness decrease downstream, indicating a reduction in channel depth, flow capacity, and channelization of the fluvial system, interpreted to be associated with facies associations, the deposits are interpreted to have been accumulated from a large DFS which can be divided into four zones, from proximal to distal: Zone 1, dominated by perennial fluvial channels; Zone 2, a mixture of perennial and ephemeral channels; Zones 3 and 4, deposits situated externally of the fluvial channel belts dominated by aeolian and floodplain deposits prevailing in each zone, respectively. The Guara acute accent Formation likely records the stratigraphic signature of the largest distributive fluvial systems reconstructed from both modern and ancient datasets, and one of the first where fluvio-aeolian interaction is quantified. The Guara acute accent Formation DFS model presented herein is key to understanding paleoenvironmental, paleoclimatic, and geotectonic changes related to Gondwanan fragmentation.

Native shrubland and managed buffelgrass savanna in drylands: Implications for ecosystem carbon and water fluxes	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Land cover and land-use change (LCLUC) between woody- and grass-dominated ecosystems in drylands comprise one of the largest uncertainties in the land CO2 sink. This is especially true for the widespread transition from shrublands to grasslands/savannas caused by the establishment of exotic C-4 grass species for grazing or through biological invasion of these species, where information about its impacts on ecosystem CO2 fluxes is limited. For studying this, we used three years of eddy covariance measurements of net ecosystem production (NEP), gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and evapotranspiration (ET) over a Sonoran Desert shrubland and an adjacent grazing savanna of buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.), established 35 years ago. At monthly, seasonal and annual time scales, we assessed whether between-site differences in CO2 fluxes were related to differences in ecosystem water use, measured as the fraction ET to precipitation, water use efficiency (WUE, i.e. the ratio between GPP and ET) and/or to the relation between R-eco, and GPP. Although the savanna had higher WUE than the shrubland, its summer NEP was limited by water use, due to limitations in leaf area index and likely rooting patterns. Conversely, the savanna had higher NEP than the shrubland during fall to spring due to increased WUE; possibly due to activity of buffelgrass and remaining woody species using (summer) water from deeper soil layers. However, differences across these seasons compensated each other at the inter-annual scale, and both sites had comparable net carbon sinks over the three-year study period. Further studies are needed to understand and reduce the uncertainty associated with carbon and water fluxes associated with LCLUC in dryland ecosystems.

The objective of this study is to test tillage with residue management under sequential and intercropping systems for carbon sequestration in semi-arid tropical drylands of India. We report the findings from a long-term field experiment (9 years) used to simu-late the effect of residue and tillage management in Maize-chickpea sequential and Maize-Pigeonpea inter -cropping systems for the four possible future climate projections using APSIM model. These findings demonstrate a sustainable route with inclusive growth, as pledged at the UN climate change summit. A comparison of results under SSP 2.6 and 4.5 Wm-2 with SSP 8.5 shows that demand pressure from competitive marketplaces inhibits the establishment of soil carbon sinks and significantly reduces crop yields, likely due to indiscriminate chemical fertilizer use. We observed that a better decision in selecting cropping system might improve soil organic carbon content (SOC). SOC content ranging from 0.9 to 1.2% in Maize-pigeonpea intercropping and 0.85-1.1% in maize -chickpea sequential cropping systems, demonstrate good potential in the climate change mitigation exertions. Early SOC saturation (20 years) led to a decreased carbon stock in topsoil without residue addition practises. The addition of crop residues significantly increased SOC levels under both conventional and minimum tillage and created additional income for farmers. Simulation analysis showed impact of SOC changes on crop yield which remained nearly stable for 85 years. Therefore, hardy straw biomass of crops covering a large tract in dryland tropics, can be a scalable and sustainable solution to yield losses, while mitigating climate change through carbon sequestration.

Results showed that the above two populations were notably different in three out of five biological parameters recorded. The response of these two populations to climate variables, viz. elevated temperature and increased levels of CO2 was assessed. These conditions prolonged the nymphal duration (14.2 days) and lowered female longevity (9.6 days), fecundity (155.5 eggs/female) and nymphal feeding rate (14.3 mm(2)) compared to ambient CO2 and temperature across the populations. Honeydew excretion by adults was significantly higher at elevated CO2 than at ambient level. At elevated CO2 and higher temperature, the Ludhiana population recorded significantly longer nymphal duration (15.9 days) and decreased amount of honeydew excretion by nymphs (13.8 mm(2)) compared to the parameters recorded at elevated CO2 and ambient temperature (12.8 days and 32.8 mm(2) respectively). In contrast, West Godavari population recorded significantly reduced female longevity and fecundity under elevated CO2 and higher temperature. Elevated CO2 per se did not adversely affect BPH biology across populations but with the concomitant increase in temperature, populations showed varying response. Location-specific mitigation strategies for management of hoppers will be required to address the varying responses of populations to climate variables.																			0011-3891					MAR 25	2019	116	6					988	996		10.18520/cs/v116/i6/988-996	http://dx.doi.org/10.18520/cs/v116/i6/988-996													WOS:000462088300030

Soil porosity changes associated with pig slurry fertilisation	ITEA-INFORMACION TECNICA ECONOMICA AGRARIA												In dryland Mediterranean areas, the usage of slurries and no-till are encouraged to reduce costs. Implementation of these practices is a challenge since they may make soil susceptible to a reduction in its physical quality (particularly through compaction). This paper aims to evaluate the effect of pig slurry fertilisation on superficial soil porosity when no-tillage is used in silty-loam soil. Winter cereal was fertilised with pig slurry at six rates. There was also a non-nitrogen treatment (control). The soil was classified as a Typic Xerofluvent. Soil porosity was studied within unaltered soil samples with a micromorphological approach. Soil samples were collected in May. From undisturbed soil samples (0-0.06 m depth), twenty-one thin sections (5 cm x 13 cm x 30 mu m) were obtained and photographed into two areas of 3.15 cm x 4.20 cm. Pores were studied using image analysis and they were classified at different intervals of apparent pore diameter (APD) from >15 mu m up to 400 mu m. Photography analysis showed porosity changes at 200-400 mu m of APD. In this interval, there was a quadratic relationship between nitrogen rate and percentage of pores (from 3.4 % to 5.2 % of total porosity). Even though the soil was compacted and had a laminar structure, these porosity changes were associated with an improvement of the soil structure. This positive consequence could be caused by the activity of the macrofauna. This effect was only detected when pig slurry was applied at agronomic rates and it was not observed in slurry treatments below 100 kg N.ha(-1) nor close to 300 kg N.ha(-1).

A film-mulched drip irrigation and subsurface pipe drainage (MDI-SPD) system has been proved to be highly efficient at mitigating salination globally. However, the soil salt balance in time and spatial dimension is unclear in this system. A MDI-SPD experiment was conducted for 4 yr (2015-2019) in a field in Manas River Basin, western China. The subsurface drainage pipes were installed at a depth of 1 m with a space of 15 m. Three long-term observation points were set at 0, 5, and 7.5 m horizontal from the subsurface pipe and served as long-term observation points in 0-to-20-, 60-to-80-, and 180-to-200-cm soil layers. Results after 4 yr indicated that the total salt output in the irrigated area was 260 t, with 103 t of salt drained by the subsurface pipe (40% of the total salt output in the irrigation area), and the seed cotton yield increased by 52%. Soil salt balance indicated desalination. The electrical conductivity (EC) of subsurface pipe drainage was positively correlated with drainage flow and salt discharge and negatively correlated with drainage discharge and time (P < .05). If salt leaching stops, soil EC at the 0-to-200-cm depth could reach 15 dS m(-1) in 8 yr. Thus, two or three uses of MDI-SPD measures in the next 8 yr should suffice to maintain the soil salt at a low concentration. An increase in shaft drainage would also reduce the deep seepage of salt.																			0002-1962	1435-0645				NOV	2021	113	6					4875	4888		10.1002/agj2.20899	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.20899		NOV 2021											WOS:000721783900001

Soil water availability directly influences plant water uptake and thus may assist with the improvement of plant trait-water relationships. However, this promise remains poorly realized due to rare tests. Here, we provide the first study that attempts to link climate factors, vertical soil water availability, and community composition at a regional scale. Our study paired field-measured vertical soil available water (0-300 cm) and community functional composition at 46 herbaceous grassland sites along a steep hydrothermal gradient in the Loess Plateau of Central China. Community functional composition was expressed via community-weighted means of eight traits. Structural equation modeling was employed to evaluate the role of vertical soil available water content, controlled by precipitation and air temperature, in affecting plant community-weighted traits. We found that soil available water content at depths of 20-100 cm was typically responsible for mediating the effects of precipitation and air temperature on plant community composition. This emerged as the predominant factor to explain variations in grassland response traits, including leaf area, specific leaf area, and leaf dry matter content. These traits exhibited clear drought-induced shifts along soil desiccation gradients and responded to drier conditions by reducing leaf area/specific leaf area and increasing leaf dry matter content. Our findings rehighlighted soil water availability as the core driver that needs to be considered in the restoration and management of dryland ecosystems. (C) 2019 The Society for Range Management.

However, the off-site impact of erosion on the soil physical and hydraulic properties of deposited sediments remains unclear, especially at catchment or larger scales. Here, we measured soil physical and hydraulic properties in erosion topography (hillslopes) and deposition topography (check dams) at 0-2 m depth in five eroding catchments across China's Loess Plateau. Results indicated that the deposition zone exhibited a higher clay content (+13%) at the southern sites with a finer texture and a higher erosion modulus, while the same zone exhibited a higher sand content (+25%) at the northern sites with a coarser texture and a higher extreme rainfall erosivity. The deposition zone exhibited a higher bulk density (+9%) and a lower saturated hydraulic conductivity (-13%), field capacity (-9%), and porosity (-5%) than those of the erosion zone, which was strengthened by a higher mean annual precipitation. Soil macroaggregate proportion and mean weight diameter of aggregates were significantly lower in the deposition zone (14.36% and 0.69 mm, respec-tively) than those in the erosion zone (15.71% and 0.75 mm, respectively), and the differences were larger at sites with higher rainfall erosivity levels and in surface 20 cm soils. However, sediment reaggregation occurred due to the accumulation of binding agents such as clay and organic carbon at sites with lower rainfall erosivity levels. The spatial heterogeneities of sediment physical and hydraulic properties were greater than or similar to those of soils in the erosion zone. Results of our study highlight the dependence of variations in soil physical and hydraulic properties driven by erosion and deposition on erosion factors, which contributes to a better under-standing of the hydrology cycle and carbon stability in erosion and deposition topographies.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				MAR	2023	222								106891	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106891	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106891		DEC 2022											WOS:000954323500001

The resulting lack of objective norms for CES may lead to the loss of the multiple non-material factors that contribute to how a landscape is valued and experienced. This is especially true under ecological restoration, which could sharply change how people experience landscapes. Therefore, our aim in this study was to identify and analyze the CES that arise from people's interaction with their landscape, focusing specifically on the influences of different ecological restoration strategies. We carried out semi-structured interviews with the residents of villages in the Xilin Gol League, Inner Mongolia, China. Regarding the implementation of ecological restoration measures, the people living in typical pastoral zones would be most affected by these measures because their main livelihood (animal husbandry) depends strongly on grasslands. Our results demonstrated that human perception of the CES provided by landscapes is affected not only by the factors related to an individual's cultural worldview (e.g., ethnicity, age, education) but also by the utility of landscape features, which are reflected in the individual's landscape dependence (occupation). Our research provides a cultural perspective for aspects of local well-being in addition to ecological and economic targets. Understanding these other aspects is critical for implementing sustainable ecological restoration.

A complex of soilborne pathogens is responsible for damping-off and root rot in the Northern Great Plains. Species within this complex include Fusarium spp., Pythium spp., and Rhizoctonia solani. Currently, partially resistant cultivars and fungicide seed treatments are the most effective for control of damping-off and root mt. This study examined 25 chickpea cultivars and breeding lines with and without a fungicide seed treatment (fluxapyroxad, pyraclostrobin, and metalaxyl) for stand establishment and grain yield in field conditions. Experimental plots were located in dryland and irrigated fields at the Eastern Agriculture Research Center (EARC) in Sidney MT in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Stand counts were recorded three times to calculate area under disease progress curve (AUDPC). Yield, and protein content (only in 2021) was assessed after harvest. In 2021, pathogens were isolated from chickpea roots showing signs of root rot and identified as Fusarium solani. The results showed that the seed treatments effectively decreased soilborne disease development (75%-84%) and improved chickpea yield (11%-14%) in 2020 and 2021, and increased protein content (0.6%) in 2021. Different cultivars did not have a consistent impact on disease development and yield protection. NDC160166 and NDC160236 displayed consistently lower disease and higher yield and might be a future source of disease resistance. Yield of untreated seeds decreased and AUDPC increased for all cultivars/lines in both years. A negative correlation was also observed between protein content and chickpea yield in 2021.

Spatially, we selected a transect that cuts across the eastern edge of the Mu Us Sandy Land, sand sheets distributed loess hills (sand-loess hills), loess hills, and adjacent rocky mountains to collect surface sediment samples. Temporally, we selected a site on a sampling sand-loess hill to collected depth incremental samples in a 320 cm depth soil profile to analyze sediment sources using the multiple composite fingerprinting approach. We screened out a group of optimal composite fingerprints that correctly classified sediment sources at 100%. Greater than half of all sediment on sand-loess hills originated from the sandy land area on the sampling transect, and roughly half from the sandy land in the soil profile, while the remaining sediment all originated from the loess hills, and rocky mountains had no contributing effect. Coarse particles (> 100 mu m) on sand-loess hills were mainly transported from the Mu Us Sandy Land, while fine particles were mainly from loess hills, indicating the importance of aeolian activity in the transport of sand from the Mu Us Sandy Land to loess hills. Environmental changes chronicled by sediment deposition at approximately 12.85 ka BP in the soil profile were primarily attributed to climate change. This study confirms that the composite fingerprinting approach is a feasible method for future studies on sediment sources in areas influenced by complex erosion agencies, landforms and soil types.					li, yuanyuan/GZA-4435-2022														0016-7061	1872-6259				MAR 1	2019	337						649	663		10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.10.024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.10.024													WOS:000456761500064

However, few studies have considered the anisotropy, and the scale-location dependence relationship may not be fully characterized. In this study, transects with dominant directions of SOM variability in the dryland farming regions of Songliao Plain, China were extracted by anisotropy analysis. The scale-location specific multivariate relationships between SOM and environmental factors along the two transects were examined using multiple wavelet coherence. Results indicated that the scale and location-specific variations in SOM and environmental factors were direction-specific. The major direction with the most significant SOM variations was 56 degrees east by north, while the minor direction was perpendicular to the major direction. The strongest single factor for explaining SOM variations differed between two dominant directions, sand along the major direction (average wavelet coherence (AWC) = 0.57, percentage area of significant coherence (PASC) = 40.32% at all scales) and bulk density (BD) along the minor direction (AWC = 0.66, PASC = 50.16% at all scales). The combination of mean annual temperature (MAT) and BD was the best to explain SOM variations along the major direction (AWC = 0.78, PASC = 46.23% at all scales). A two-factor combination is adequate to explain SOM variability along the major direction, whereas a single factor is sufficient for the explanation along the minor direction. More factors did not evidently increase or even decrease the percentage of scale-location domains where SOM variations were significantly explained. This work has important implications for developing future sampling strategies and preparing detailed digital soil maps.

The experimental design was a factorial arrangement of control, B+Com, cover crop, and combination of cover crop and B+Com (cover crop/B+Com) treatments in alleys with four replications. The B+Com comprised a 1:1 ratio of biochar and compost and was applied at a rate of 22 Mg ha-1 dry weight basis in May 2017 and 2019. The cover crop consisted of a dryland forage mixture and bird's-foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.). B+Com treatment did not affect cover crop biomass or tissue C and N concentrations except for a 12% reduction in 2019 biomass. B+Com and cover crop/B+Com increased soil C content averaged across sampling dates by 11% and 17% (P < 0.05), respectively, only at the 0-15 cm soil depth compared with the control. Cover crop treatment did not affect (P < 0.05) soil C content at two soil depths in all sampling dates. Soil N content was not affected by B+Com, decreased by an average of 12.5% at both soil depths with cover crop, and increased with cover crop/B+Com by 4% only at the 0-15 cm soil depth averaged across sampling dates (P < 0.05). Grape yield was increased by 32% by cover crop/B+Com relative to control only in 2020. The cover crop reduced petiole N and pruning weights in one or two years out of three.

However, little is known about how different rhizosphere microbiota respond to the growth stages of drought-resistant crops under different irrigation regimes. To address these issues, we investigated the effects of irrigation regimes on the rhizosphere prokaryotic and fungal communities at the pre-and post-anthesis stages of oats in a semi-arid region of northeastern China. The prokaryotic and fungal community traits of the oat rhizosphere were characterized by Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The results revealed that the pro-karyotic diversity was primarily regulated by oat growth stage, while the fungal diversity was mainly increased by irrigation regimes. Similarly, all prokaryotic phyla responded significantly to oat growth stages rather than irrigation regimes, while the composition of the fungal taxa was largely regulated by irrigation regimes. Approximately 2-3-fold higher proportions of the predominating pathogenic Fusarium genus were identified under dryland farming conditions than under irrigation treatment. In addition, functional predictions suggested that the contrasting responsive traits of prokaryotes and fungi were attributed to their functional guilds, which were related to oat growth stages and soil water conditions. However, the properties of the prokaryotic networks mainly responded to irrigation regimes while the fungal networks were regulated by oat growth, implying distinct determination mechanisms for microbial diversity and community stability. Our results indicate that rhizosphere prokaryotic and fungal communities differentially responded to oat growth stages and soil water history, highlighting the significance of irrigation in manipulating rhizosphere microbes in semi-arid regions.

Invasion of an exotic annual forb affects grass-feeding termites in a semi-arid woodland	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Invasive plants are known to have dramatic and generally negative effects on ecosystems. The rapid spread and naturalization of Carrichtera annua (wards weed) across large areas of southern Australia has been widely reported, but its effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functions are poorly known. We examined the effects of Carrichtera on grass-feeding termites Drepanotermes spp. and hypothesized that increasing cover of Carrichtera would reduce termite abundance, which we assessed using the density of their above-ground pavements as a proxy for density. Our study was conducted at two spatial scales to explore (i) potential effects of Carrichtera invasion under variable intensities of grazing and (ii) differences between invaded and uninvaded sites at a long-ungrazed conservation reserve. Increasing cover of Carrichtera was associated with a greater density of pavements, both under grazed conditions and within the conservation reserve. However, increasing grazing intensity tended to be associated with reduced pavement density and size, through indirect reductions in plant biomass. Greater cover of Carrichtera was associated with declines in the cover of native plants and biocrusts, but not native plant richness. Pavement size tended to decline with increasing pavement density. Under conservation, Carrichtera sites supported more pavements, but densities declined markedly in drought years. The lower resilience to droughts and the fact that pavements in Carrichtera-invaded sites tended to be less cemented and contain more ants, suggest that invasion by Carrichtera may have long-term functional implications for processes mediated by termites. Increasingly, drier climates in southern Australia may exacerbate reductions in ecosystem functions given the pivotal role played by termites in dryland food webs and ecosystem functions.

Their natural vegetation cover is affected by both abiotic stresses and human activities and, therefore, suitable managements are needed for their sustainability. This study was carried out in the mountain rangeland chain of Matmata (southern dryland of Tunisia) during the springs of 2 rainy yr, 2019 and 2020. Our aims were to evaluate the impact of three grazing regimes (grazing exclusion [over 42 ys; 1978-2020]; seasonal [protected in spring and summer and grazed in autumn and winter, since the 1960s]; and continuous grazing [control; grazed over time]) on the cover of some plant life forms (Raunkiaer, Noy-Meir, and Grime types), under various conditions (sites, aspects, and elevations). To achieve this goal, the pseudoreplicated-nested design was applied, taking into account the site locations (grazing regimes), aspects (exposure to sunlight), and elevations. The cover of the retained plant life forms was measured using the quadrat point method. The main results showed that plant life forms are strongly affected by the grazing regime since the chamephytes (Ch_R), arido-active (AA_NM), and competitive stress-tolerant species (CS_G) are higher under seasonal grazing than control. All these species are qualified as less resistant to grazing. However, arido-passive (AP_NM), ruderal stress-tolerant (RS_G), and therophytes (Th_R) seem to be more resistant to grazing. Studying the impact of grazing management on the plant life form types provides useful information to find the most adapted species for rangeland sustainability all around the world.

Surface drip fertigation (SDF) and subsurface drip fertigation (SSDF) enables the combined application of fertilizer and irrigation for improving the input use efficiency in Cotton-Wheat cropping system (CWCS) over the SF. Though, both SDF and SSDF perform better than SF, but their suitability in reducing the water footprint (WF) of CWCS has been least assessed. Therefore, a 2 yr field study at two distinct agro-climatic zones has been conducted to quantify and compare the WF of SDF and SSDF in comparison to SF for CWCS under semi-arid environments. Results revealed that under SSDF, cotton and wheat crops consumed 32 and 37% lower water than respective SF, indicative of huge water saving over the prevalent practice. Contribution of green, blue and grey components towards total WF under SF was 42, 48 and 10% respectively for cotton, and 24, 59 and 18% for wheat. SSDF application at 80% crop evapotranspiration (ETc) along with 100% recommended dose of nitrogen remarkably reduced the WF without any yield loss for CWCS. Higher total WF for CWCS under SF (5.30 m3 kg-1) revealed it to be inferior as compared to SDF (3.71 m3 kg-1) and SSDF (3.52 m3 kg-1). Cotton alone consumed 65-78% of WFtotal of the CWCS, while the remaining 22-35% was attributed to wheat. A lowered WFtotal for CWCS under SDF and SSDF over that of SF elucidated them to be immensely helpful to conserve limited water resources under semi arid climates. A cropping system based assessment was much reliable option to obtain a clear indicator about the annual WF as compared to single crop based estimation.

However, the change of soil structure and hydraulic conductivity over time after applying biochar to expansive clayey soil under field conditions are unclear. Materials and methods In this study, biochar was applied to soil at the rates of 0% (CK), 1% (BC1), and 3% (BC3) (w/w) to assess the variation in soil physical properties after day 10, day 193, and day 375, respectively. Results and discussion The results showed that the total soil porosity estimated based on bulk density and the average particle density of 2.65 g cm(-3) was significantly higher than the total porosity as measured by water retention curve (P < 0.05). Compared with day 10, the measured total porosity at days 193 and 375 significantly decreased by 5.09% and 7.38%, respectively, under CK; however, that significantly increased by 2.14%/2.60% and 1.85%/3.60%, respectively, under BC1/BC3 (P < 0.05). The average bulk density in 1 year was significantly lower 3.30%/6.99% under BC1/BC3 than CK (P < 0.05). Compared with CK, soil pores (5-30 mu m) significantly increased by 12.71% under BC3 and soil pores (> 300 mu m) significantly increased by 114.25%/164.58% under BC1/BC3 after 375 days (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the saturated hydraulic conductivity among all treatments after 1 year (P < 0.05). Conclusions Our findings indicate that the estimated total porosity is not suitable for evaluating the change of soil porosity over time after biochar application. Biochar in size less than 2 mm can improve soil structure in expansive clayey soil under field conditions. However, these positive changes may be insufficient to facilitate the improvement of saturated hydraulic conductivity after 1 year at the biochar application rates of 1% and 3%. Our findings provide insights into the application of biochar as a soil amendment for management practices in expansive clayey soil.

Weather based forecasting of sterility mosaic disease in pigeonpea (<i>Cajanu cajan</i>) using machine learning techniques and hybrid models	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES												Modelling incidence of sterility mosaic disease (SMD) on pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] for four locations [S K Nagar (Gujarat), Gulbarga (Karnataka), Rahuri (Maharashtra) and Vamban (Tamil Nadu)] was carried out based on field data sets generated during six kharif seasons [2011-16]. Mean seasonal incidence amongst all locations was on the decline during recent periods (0.5-5.3%) over past decades (9.8-12.8%). Correlation analyses of SMD incidence with weather parameters lagged one and two weeks indicated spatial differences for the variables besides their significance. While Max T (degrees C) lagged by one week alone was significantly positive with SMD at Gulbarga (KA), Vamban (TN) had negative significance of rainfall (mm/week) and rainy days. S K Nagar (GJ) and Rahuri (MH) had shown opposite effects of both morning and evening RH (%) of both one and two lagged weeks. Support vector regression (SVR), artificial neural network (ANN) models and their combination with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models applied for prediction of SMD incidence across locations revealed performance of hybrid models in general to be better based on the evaluation criteria of root mean square error (RMSE). ARIMA-SVR>ARIMA-ANN>SVR>ANN was the order of prediction accuracies at S K Nagar (GJ), Gulbarga (KA), and Vamban (TN). At Rahuri (MH), individual models performed better over their hybrids withARIMA. While application of hybrid model of SVR-ARIMA is applicable under situations of SMD seasonal mean severity exceeding 1%, SVR model proves better for mean seasonal disease incidence in decimal values less than one.

However, how to scientifically assess and zoning management of CLC in dryland oases remains an open question. In this study, a comprehensive analytical framework was established to assess the characteristics of land-use transformation and the potential for CLC using remotely sensed and geospatial data and spatial analysis methods, a multi-objective territorial differentiation model, and collaborative path for CLC in oasis villages was proposed. The following key results were obtained. (1) From 2009 to 2018, urban and rural settlements in the hinterland of the Weiku Oasis expanded by 40 km(2), and shrub forests and grasslands in the oasis-desert transition zone shrank substantially by 21.13 km(2). The newly cultivated farmland in the oasis-desert transition zone only offset 62.9% of the occupied farmland in the hinterland of the oasis. (2) The pattern of comprehensive rural land consolidation potential in the Weiku Oasis was consistent with territorial differentiation, with a gradient decrease from the hinterland of the oasis to the desert. The average potential for Comprehensive land consolidation (PCLC) index was 0.31. (3) Three consolidation priorities and six consolidation types were identified for the proposal of 14 combined modes of CLC. Territorial differentiation with respect to the combined modes was discussed. Overall, this study provides useful insights for promoting efficient and sustainable utilization of oasis land resources and implementing zoning management.

Specifically, pollution index (Pi), Nemerow composite pollution index (Pn), and geo-accumulation index (Igeo) were used to understand the spatial distribution of six elements; while correlation, principal component, and cluster analysis to evaluate the health risk. Results show the average concentrations (mg & BULL;kg-1) of six elements in the cultivated layer: Zn (71.09), Cr (52.24), Cu (24.74), Pb (15.57), As (11.67), and Cd (0.15), among which As, Cr, Cd, and Zn were higher than the background value of Xinjiang soils by 1.04, 1.06, 1.25, and 1.03 times, respectively. Such pollution mainly troubles the eastern and northeastern parts, i.e., around the city of Kuqa, and the pollution indices from large to small were Cd, Cr, As, Zn, Cu, and Pb. Besides, despite the absence of non-carcinogenic risk, cancer risk is above the acceptable level, with children being the more vulnerable group. The non-carcinogenic risk can be largely explained by Zn and the carcinogenic risk by Cr, so the toxic element pollution mostly results from the petroleum processing industry and vehicular traffic, followed by input from other anthropogenic sources and natural soil formation.																			1230-1485	2083-5906					2023	32	4					3501	3514		10.15244/pjoes/166167	http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/166167													WOS:001038462200005

This study examined the magnitude, large-scale spatial patterns in WUE, and underlying drivers by examining published data from 31 eddy-covariance (EC) towers and remote sensing based assessments of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) along a southwest-to-northeast aridity gradient in China. Average growing-season WUE at the 31 sites was 1.67 +/- 0.98 g C kg(-1) H2O. Water use efficiencies among vegetation types were significantly higher for cropland and forest, and lower for shrubland and grassland ecosystems (all p-values < 0.01). Together, meteoric water and elevation explained 73% of the cross-gradient variation in WUE. Water use efficiency was shown to increase in direct association with increasing precipitation (PPT) and indirectly through PPT's effect on NDVI. Among ecosystem types, WUE for cropland was most sensitive to PPT and NDVI, whereas shrubland WUE was the least sensitive to these factors. Water use efficiency in the semi-arid zone was more sensitive to the PPT and NDVI, unlike the other climatic zones. Although growing-season PPT was important to WUE for the drier parts of China, it was less important for the dry sub-humid, moderately wetter parts of the country. The present findings showed WUE in dryland ecosystems in China to be firmly controlled by PPT. This suggests that future climate change may have differential outcomes on ecosystem carbon and water cycling along an aridity gradient, leading to the observed cross-gradient differences in ecosystem WUE's.					bai, yu/HLW-5287-2023														1470-160X	1872-7034				MAR	2020	110								105932	10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105932	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105932													WOS:000507381800082

A two-year study was conducted in the Southern Great Plains, USA, semi-arid region, to determine optimum levels of irrigation, row spacing, and tillage to maximize WUE and maintain forage production in pearl millet. Pearl millet was planted in a strip-split-plot factorial design at two row widths, 76 and 19 cm, in tilled and no-till soil under three irrigation levels (high, moderate, and limited). The results were consistent between production years. Both WUE and forage yield were impacted by tillage; however, irrigation level had the greatest effect on forage production. Row spacing had no effect on either WUE or forage yield. The pearl millet water use-yield production function was y = 6.68 x x (mm) - 837 kg ha(-1); however, a low coefficient of determination (r(2) = 0.31) suggests that factors other than water use (WU), such as a low leaf area index (LAI), had greater influence on dry matter (DM) production. Highest WUE (6.13 Mg ha(-1) mm(-1)) was achieved in tilled soil due to greater LAI and DM production than in no-till.

Integrating ontogeny and ontogenetic dependency into community assembly	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1.Many studies of community assembly focus on a single ontogenetic stage (typically adults) when trying to infer assembly processes from patterns of biodiversity. This focus ignores the finding that assembly mechanisms may strongly differ between life--stages, and the role of ontogenetic dependency: the mechanisms by which one life stage directly affects the composition of another life stage. 2. Within a 4--ha forest dynamics plot in California USA, we explored how the relative importance of multiple assembly processes shifts across life stages and assessed ontogenetic dependency of seedlings on adults in woody plant communities. To assess variation in assembly processes across life stages, we examined how ss--diversity of adult and seedling communities were each influenced by space and 13 environmental variables (soils, topography) using distance--based redundancy analysis and variation partitioning. We then assessed the ontogenetic dependency of seedlings on adults by including adult composition as a predictor in the seedling community variation partitioning. 3. We found differences between adult and seedling composition. For the adults, we found 18 species including pines, oaks and manzanitas characteristic of this mid--elevation forest. For seedlings, we found 11 species, and that oaks made up 75% of all seedlings while only making up 45% of all adults. Adult ss--diversity was primarily explained by space (44.0%) with environment only explaining 18.6% and 37.4% unexplained. In contrast, most of the explained variation in seedling ss--diversity was due to ontogenetic dependency alone (13.6% explained by adult composition) with 1.6% explained by space and the environment jointly, and 62.8% unexplained. 4. Synthesis: Here, we describe a conceptual framework for integrating ontogeny more explicitly into community assembly research and demonstrate how different assembly processes structured adult and seedling ss--diversity in a temperate dry forest. While adult ss- -diversity was largely driven by spatial processes, seedling ss--diversity was largely unexplained, with ontogenetic dependency comprising most of the explained variation. These patterns suggest that future assemblyresearch should consider how assembly processes and their underlying mechanisms may shift with ontogeny, and that interactions between ontogenetic stages (ontogenetic dependency) are critical to consider when assessing variation in -assembly processes.

Few of these systems are organic, however, and no relevant research had been conducted on this topic. A large-scale (41 ha) systems research study was conducted for 3 yr (2018-2021) to compare a transitional organic dual-purpose wheat system with a conventional one, with system management components customized to the ecological region. Organic wheat yield was 20% lower than conventional in the first season of organic transition, but there was no yield difference by the third year. The yield improvement in the organic system may be attributed to N fixation by a legume-based cash crop the previous winter season, exogenous nutrients from application of composted manure, and appropriate wheat cultivar selection. Because of limited moisture, relying on annual establishment of summer cover crops to fix N and deliver other ecosystem services in the organic system was not feasible in most years. Grain protein concentration (GPC) of the transitional organic wheat ranged from 91 to 103 g kg(-1), below the 120 g kg(-1) threshold for a food market organic price premium. More intensive N management, including in-season application of a more available form of N that is organic approved, could be an effective strategy to increase GPC. This proof-of-concept study shows that organic dual-purpose wheat systems can be a viable enterprise in the SGP, though additional research is needed to address challenges identified herein.

However, operationalising the concept requires practitioners to understand the likelihood of different E outcomes and GxM combinations that would maximise yields while managing risks. Here we propose and demonstrate an analysis framework to inform crop designs (GxM) at the time of sowing of a dryland maize crop, that combines data sets from multi-environment field experimentation and crop simulation modelling, and that accounts for risk preference. A network of replicated, G by M on-farm and on-research station trials (n = 10), conducted across New South Wales and Queensland, Australia, over three seasons (2014-2016) was collected. The trials consisted of combinations of commercial maize hybrids, sown at a range of plant densities and row configurations producing site average yields (Environment-yield) that varied between 1576 and 7914 kg ha(-1). Experimental data were used to test the capacity of APSIM-Maize 7.10 to simulate the experimental results, and to in-silico create a large synthetic data set of multi-E (sites x seasons) factorial combination of crop designs. Data mining techniques were applied on the synthetic data set, to derive a probabilistic model to predict the likely Environment-yield and associated risk from variables known at sowing, and to derive simple "rules of thumb" for farmers that discriminate high and low yielding crop designs across the lower, middle and upper tercile of the predicted Environment-yields. Four risk profiles are described, a "Dynamic" (i.e. each year the farmer would adopt a crop design based on the predicted Environment-yield tercile and corresponding "rules of thumb"), "High rewards seeker" (i.e. each year the farmer would adopt the crop design that optimises yield for the higher tercile of Environment-yields), "Middle'er" (i.e. each year the farmer would adopt the crop design that optimises yield for the middle tercile of Environment-yields), and "Risk averse" (i.e. each year the farmer would adopt the crop design that optimises yield for the lower tercile of Environment-yields). The difference in yield between the lowest and highest performing crop design was ca. 50 % which translates into a ca. 2-fold change in water use efficiency, i.e. from 8 to 15 kg grain mm(-1) rainfall. APSIM-Maize explained 88 % of the variability in the experimental data set. The validated model was used to extend the number of E sampled by adding additional sites within the same region and using historical climate records for the period 1950-2018. Crop available water at the time of sowing was a good predictor for the likelihood of the season falling within each of the three Environment-yield terciles. Recursive partitioning trees showed that plant density and hybrid were the main variables discriminating crop performance within the upper, middle and lower terciles of Environment-yields. The probability distribution functions for yield resulting from the alternative risk management strategies were tested in terms of changes in the mean yield, an index of yield stability, and down-side risk i.e. the likelihood of achieving a non-economic yield. We conclude that (i) for dryland maize cropping, the crop water availability at the time of sowing can be used to inform optimum crop designs, increase yields and yield stability and reduce down-side risks; and (ii) the proposed framework is useful to untangle complex GxExM interactions in field experimentation that provide a transferable platform to develop simple rules to identify optimum crop designs early in the season.

Long-term cover crop effects on biomass, soil nitrate, soil water, and wheat	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Cover crops during summer fallow have been rarely researched in the semiarid northern Great Plains. This study was conducted during 2012-2019 at four Montana locations and included four functional groups (Brassica family, fibrous-rooted crops, legumes, and tap-rooted crops). Eleven treatments included sole functional groups, a Full Mix, the Full Mix minus each functional group, pea, and chemical fallow. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was grown after each cover crop year with three nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates. Cover crops were terminated with herbicide at first flower stage of pea (Pisum sativum L.) 57 to 66 days after planting. Shoot biomass averaged 2.0 Mg ha(-1) over eight site-years representative of dryland farming in Montana. Using equal overall plant densities, treatments with six species averaged 13% greater biomass than two species. Measured at termination to a 0.9-m depth, Fallow held greater soil water than cover crop treatments, with Fallow averaging 57 mm greater than the Full Mix. Soil nitrate averaged 49 kg N ha(-1) greater after Fallow than the Full Mix; the Legume treatment averaged 26 kg N ha(-1) greater than the Minus Legume treatment. Wheat yield on Fallow averaged 0.85 Mg ha(-1) greater than the Full Mix in 5 of 10 site-years, mainly at the driest site-years. The Legume treatment elevated wheat protein over the Minus Legume treatment by an average of 15 g kg(-1). Cover crops grown during summer fallow reduced soil nitrate-N, soil water, and wheat yields compared with chemical fallow, especially in the major wheat growing region of north central Montana.																			0002-1962	1435-0645				JUL	2023	115	4					1705	1722		10.1002/agj2.21336	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.21336		MAY 2023											WOS:000994741300001

The widespread land degradation caused by soil wind erosion in these areas is the main reason for the low quality of life of the local people. Therefore, soil wind erosion control has become an urgent task for governments. As is well known, understanding the dynamic process of soil wind erosion is the premise on which effective measures of soil wind erosion control are developed. However, the spatial heterogeneity of shear-stress generated by wind on the soil of rough surfaces and its driving mechanism on soil wind erosion have not been fully understood. Based on a series of wind tunnel experiments, the distribution of wind-caused shear-stress on the exposed soil surface (tau s) of rough surfaces with plants, gravels, and ridges was calculated, and the probability density function of tau s on these rough surfaces followed the pattern of the logistic function. The location parameter and scale parameter in the logistic function were correlated with the lateral coverage, ridge index and friction wind velocity on rough surfaces. Subsequently, a soil wind erosion rate model with the characteristics of an upscaling point-scale process was established. Tested by multi-source experimental data, the model has a satisfactory prediction ability. These findings greatly improved the understanding of the spatial heterogeneity of tau s and the driving mechanism of tau s in soil wind erosion, which will help establish a dynamic-based wind erosion rate model in the future.					贾, 文茹/IST-8607-2023; Zhang, Junjie/IUO-4126-2023	Zhang, Junjie/0000-0002-4299-6112; Li, Huiru/0000-0001-7334-569X													0341-8162	1872-6887				DEC	2022	219								106633	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106633	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106633		SEP 2022											WOS:000864646700001

The sequence is well known for the occurrence of an early land plant Cooksonia flora. The spore assemblages are dominated by cryptospores (67%), particularly laevigate monads and dyads. Trilete spores are less abundant but are diverse in composition and provide the principal means of accurately dating the sequence. Eleven cryptospore taxa and 31 trilete taxa are identified. Two new species, Cymbohilates richardsonii and Velamisporites edwardsae, are erected. The Freshwater East microflora contains a distinctive complex of Chelinospora taxa, here named the Chelinospora lavidensis assemblage. It represents a previously unrecognised assemblage within the Pridoli succession of the Anglo-Welsh Basin. An accurate age for this assemblage has been determined by correlation with the Upper Silurian succession of the Cantabrian Mountains in north-west Spain, where a continuous spore succession through the Pridoli Series has independent biostratigraphical age control from chitinozoans. The Freshwater East assemblages are correlated with the upper part of the Chelinospora hemiesferica (H) Biozone, which is dated by the chitinozoans Margachitina elegans and Pseudoclathrochitina carmenchui as early mid Pridoli in age. Rare occurrences of small spiny acritarchs, sphaeromorph acritarchs and prasinophyte phycomata in two of the Freshwater East assemblages support the sedimentological data that indicate the grey-green heterolithic beds were deposited in tidally influenced fluvial and estuarine environments.																			0191-6122	1558-9188				OCT 2	2022	46	4							2070785	10.1080/01916122.2022.2070785	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01916122.2022.2070785		MAY 2022											WOS:000808201600001

However, information on the various methods of residue management on micronutrients in soil and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) over time is limited. A long-term (84-year) agroecosystem experiment was assessed to determine the impact of fertilizer type and methods of crop residue management on micronutrients over time under dryland winter wheat-fallow rotation. The treatments were: no N application with residue burning in fall (FB), spring (SB), and no residue burn (NB); 45 kg N ha(-1) with SB and NB; 90 kg N ha(-1) with SB and NB; pea vines; and farmyard manure (FYM) and a nearby undisturbed grass pasture (GP). Wheat grain, straw, and soil samples from 1995, 2005, and 2015 were used to determine tissue total and soil Mehlich III extractable Mn, Cu, B, Fe, and Zn, and soil pH. After 84 years, extractable Mn and B in the top 10 cm of soil decreased in all plots, except for B in FYM and SB. The FYM plots had the highest extractable Mn (114 mg kg(-1)) in the top 10 cm soil; however, it declined by 33% compared to the GP (171 mg kg(-1)). Extractable Zn in the top 10 cm of soil increased with FYM while it decreased with inorganic N application in 2015; however, total Zn in grain increased by 7% with inorganic N (90 kg ha(-1)) application compared to FYM application. The results suggest that residue management had similar impact on soil micronutrients. Inorganic N and FYM application can be integrated to reduce micronutrient losses from cultivation.

Modeled El Nino-Southern Oscillation Effects on Grain Sorghum under Varying Irrigation Strategies and Cultural Practices	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Equatorial sea surface temperatures vary systematically to cause the El Nino southern oscillation (ENSO) that produces predictable weather patterns in North America and may permit long-range climate predictions and eventual proactive summer crop irrigation management. The declining Ogallala Aquifer in the Southern High Plains and consequently limited well capacities challenge producers to adapt cropping practices for irrigation that doesn't meet crop water demand. Our objective was to evaluate sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] yield response to ENSO climate-informed management of cultural practices and irrigation strategies on a Pullman soil (fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Torrertic Paleustoll). We used the simulation model SORKAM and long-term (1961-2000) weather records from Bushland, TX, classified by ENSO phase to calculate sorghum grain yields for all combinations of irrigation levels (0.0, 2.5, 3.75, or 5.0 mm d(-1)), planting day of year (DOY = 135, 156, 176), and cultivar maturity (early, 95 d; medium, 105 d; late, 120 d). Using the September-November Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) to identify ENSO phase, La Nina years had 50 mm less precipitation and a corresponding 14.5% reduction in overall yield to 4550 kg ha(-1) for sorghum planted at 16 plants m(-2) population. Late maturing cultivars and late planting led to sorghum freeze injury and reduced yields regardless of ENSO phase. While yields consistently increased with irrigation, we conclude that concentrating water to irrigate an area partitioned 2:1 or 1:1 at 3.75- or 5.0-mm d(-1) with complementary dryland produced >30% more grain, overall, than uniformly irrigating an area at 2.5 mm d(-1).

Deep N application is often suggested to ensure effectively use of water stored in the subsoil. This experiment was carried out in two different fields with different soils at Transitional Zone Agricultural Research Institute (TZARI) between 2012-2015 in the fallow-wheat rotation system. Efficiency of six different applications (1- deep Autumn 40 kg N ha(-1)(A40), 2- deep Autumn 20 kg N ha(-1) (A20), 3-deep Spring 40 kg N ha(-1)(S40), 4- deep Spring 20 kg N ha(-1)(S20), 5- Traditional (T), 6- Control (C)) was investigated in Mufitbey and Bezostaja1 cultivars. The highest grain yield (4861 kg ha(-1)) was obtained in deep application of 20 kg N ha(-1) in autumn, and the lowest grain yield (3969 kg ha(-1)) was obtained in control. Also, the highest protein content of 12.65% was obtained with deep N applications of 20 kg N ha(-1) in autumn, while the lowest GPC (11.37%) was found in the control. Significant and high correlations occurred between nitrate content at 60 cm soil depth in the grain filling period and spike N uptake (r = 0.85, P < .001), GPC (r = 0.84 P < .001), farinograph number (r = 0.85, P < .05), development time (r = 0.83 P < .05) and yield (r = 0.96, P < .001). Significant occurred between Bezostaja1 and Mufitbey in rheological (dough) properties. The data showed that climate and soil conditions should be taken into account in deep N application in dryland wheat farming.					karaduman, Yaşar/AAJ-6853-2020; Savasli, Erdinc/AAI-2572-2019	karaduman, Yaşar/0000-0003-1306-3572; Savasli, Erdinc/0000-0001-5326-4710													0010-3624	1532-2416				SEP 25	2023	54	17					2412	2424		10.1080/00103624.2023.2223639	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2023.2223639		JUN 2023											WOS:001004234800001

H.			Association of canopy temperature with agronomic traits in spring wheat inbred populations	EUPHYTICA												Canopy temperature (CT) is considered a reliable proxy for stomatal conductance. Low CT values of plant canopies under water-limited conditions are associated with high transpiration indicating plants' drought tolerance. Many U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW) adapted wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars lack stress-adaptive traits resulting in poor performance in drought environments. This study aims to identify the stress-adaptive traits by evaluating the CT in spring wheat populations across different soil moisture conditions in the PNW. An infrared thermometer was used to estimate the CT in two families of recombinant inbred lines, 'Alpowa' x 'Express' (AE population) and 'Hollis' x 'Drysdale' (HD population), in rainfed and irrigated environments of the dryland PNW in 2011 to 2013. Higher reductions in grain yield up to 170%, spike length up to 25%, and spikelets spike(-1) up to 19% were observed in a rainfed environment compared to the reductions in an irrigated environment. A significant variation in CT was observed in both AE and HD populations. With 1 & DEG;C increase in CT at the anthesis stage, grain yield was lowered up to 38 g m(-2). Low CT was associated with high grain yield and agronomic traits in both wheat populations (r = - 0.18 to - 0.55, P & LE; 0.05). The highest association between CT and grain yield was observed at anthesis (r = - 0.47) and milking (r = - 0.38) stages (P & LE; 0.001). Our results show that screening for low CT during terminal wheat growth stage is an effective strategy for improving the selection of new drought-tolerant wheat varieties in the PNW.

METHODS: This study investigated the validity of differentiated ratings of perceived exertion (dRPE) recorded from the chest (RPE-chest) and legs (RPE-legs) during aquatic cycling and aimed to determine a simple and accurate estimate of dRPE to regulate aquabiking. Twelve active young subjects performed a pedaling task on an immersed ergocycle using randomly imposed cycling cadences ranging from 50 to 100 rpm in 3-minute steps interspersed by 3-minute active recovery periods. dRPE and cardiorespiratory responses (heart rate [HR]; percentage of heart rate peak value [%HRpeak]; oxygen uptake [(V)over dot O-2]; and percentage of peak oxygen uptake [%(V)over dotO(2peak)]) were measured during the last minute of each level. RESULTS: The data described three-step relationships between dRPE and rpm. RPE-chest and RPE-legs increased linearly only for cadences between 60 and 90 rpm (r=0.81 and r=0.88, respectively; P<0.001). At these cadences, significant relationships were also observed between dRPE and all the physiological data (highest Pearson product moment for %(V)over dot O-2peak: 0.81 for RPE-chest and 0.88 for RPE-legs, P<0.0001). Last, the classic signal dominance from the legs was observed (RPE-legs>RPE-chest, P<0.0001) but was reduced compared with data obtained during dryland cycling, suggesting a modulating effect of the aquatic medium. CONCLUSIONS: Cycling cadence was the better estimator of RPE-legs, which seemed to be the more appropriate dRPE to regulate the intensity of aquabiking in a safe range of pedaling rates.

Hydraulic redistribution buffers climate variability and regulates grass-tree interactions in a semiarid riparian savanna	ECOHYDROLOGY												Anticipating the ability of ecosystems to maintain functional integrity across predicted altered precipitation regimes remains a grand ecohydrological challenge. Overstory trees and understory grasses within semiarid savannas vary in their structure and sensitivity to environmental pressures, underscoring the need to examine the ecohydrological implications of this climatic variability. Whereas precipitation has long been recognized as a key driver of landscape ecohydrology, understanding a site's hydraulic redistribution regime (the balance in downward and upward movement of water and the seasonality of these bidirectional flows) may be equally important to understanding moisture availability to vegetation in these dryland ecosystems. As a result, we linked measures of ecosystem-scale carbon exchange, overstory tree sap flux and leaf-level gas exchange to understory whole-plot and leaf-level carbon and water exchange within intact and trenched plots (isolating trees from grasses) in a riparian savanna ecosystem. We maintained measurements across 2 years with distinct precipitation regimes. We found that interannual precipitation variability yielded a categorical shift in the directionality and magnitude of the hydraulic redistribution regime-even within this single site. Additionally, we found that connectivity between overstory trees and understory grasses through hydraulic redistribution created a short period of competition within an average rain year but that facilitation of understory function by overstory trees was much greater and lasted longer during drier years. Together, these findings suggest that hydraulic redistribution can serve as a hydrologic buffer against interannual precipitation variability. Given current climate projections of more variable precipitation within and across years, understanding how hydraulic redistribution regimes vary through time will greatly enhance our capacity to anticipate future ecohydrological function.

This paper aims to address the challenges of studying this highly gradient landscape with a grass-shrub-tree continuum. This study takes place in South Luangwa National Park (SLNP) in eastern Zambia. Discretely classifying land cover in savannas is notoriously difficult because vegetation species and structural groups may be very similar, giving off nearly indistinguishable spectral signatures. A support vector machine classification was tested and it produced an accuracy of only 34.48%. Therefore, we took a novel continuous approach in evaluating this change by coupling in situ data with Landsat-level normalized difference vegetation index data (NDVI, as a proxy for vegetation abundance) and blackbody surface temperature (BBST) data into a rule-based classification for November 2015 (wet season) that was 79.31% accurate. The resultant rule-based classification was used to extract mean Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI values by season over time from 2000 to 2016. This showed a distinct separation between each of the classes consistently over time, with woodland having the highest NDVI, followed by shrubland and then grassland, but an overall decrease in NDVI over time in all three classes. These changes may be due to a combination of precipitation, herbivory, fire, and humans. This study highlights the usefulness of a continuous time-series-based approach, which specifically integrates surface temperature and vegetation abundance-based NDVI data into a study of land cover and vegetation health for savanna landscapes, which will be useful for park managers and conservationists globally.

Split N application seeks to improve nitrogen use efficiency in both small-holdings and large-scale mechanized farms, but lack of conclusive evidence on its benefits restricts the adoption of this practice. Here we report a global meta-analysis of split N application in wheat using 129 studies with 2661 comparisons. Split N in 3-4 applications improved yield by 7.0 % and grain protein by 5.2 % in relation to single application. The effect of split N on yield was larger for winter wheat than for spring wheat, while split N improved grain protein in both winter and spring wheat. Its effects on both yield and grain protein were larger under conventional tillage, in humid climate especially for winter wheat, in coarse textured soils, on less fertile soils, and at high N rate. Splitting N in 3-4 applications would increase annual production of winter wheat by 12.9 M t grain and 1.3 M t protein globally. By identifying the conditions where split N application is more likely to deliver agronomic benefits, our study would contribute to the targeted adoption of this practice.					王, 娅冰/JGE-0541-2023														0167-1987	1879-3444				SEP	2021	213								105111	10.1016/j.still.2021.105111	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2021.105111		JUN 2021											WOS:000687292800004

The impact of agricultural management on soil aggregation and carbon storage is regulated by climatic thresholds across a 3000 km European gradient	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Organic carbon and aggregate stability are key features of soil quality and are important to consider when evaluating the potential of agricultural soils as carbon sinks. However, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how soil organic carbon (SOC) and aggregate stability respond to agricultural management across wide environmental gradients. Here, we assessed the impact of climatic factors, soil properties and agricultural management (including land use, crop cover, crop diversity, organic fertilization, and management intensity) on SOC and the mean weight diameter of soil aggregates, commonly used as an indicator for soil aggregate stability, across a 3000 km European gradient. Soil aggregate stability (-56%) and SOC stocks (-35%) in the topsoil (20 cm) were lower in croplands compared with neighboring grassland sites (uncropped sites with perennial vegetation and little or no external inputs). Land use and aridity were strong drivers of soil aggregation explaining 33% and 20% of the variation, respectively. SOC stocks were best explained by calcium content (20% of explained variation) followed by aridity (15%) and mean annual temperature (10%). We also found a threshold-like pattern for SOC stocks and aggregate stability in response to aridity, with lower values at sites with higher aridity. The impact of crop management on aggregate stability and SOC stocks appeared to be regulated by these thresholds, with more pronounced positive effects of crop diversity and more severe negative effects of crop management intensity in nondryland compared with dryland regions. We link the higher sensitivity of SOC stocks and aggregate stability in nondryland regions to a higher climatic potential for aggregate-mediated SOC stabilization. The presented findings are relevant for improving predictions of management effects on soil structure and C storage and highlight the need for site-specific agri-environmental policies to improve soil quality and C sequestration.

Research findings show that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can reduce the negative effects of salinization and facilitate the revegetation of salinized dryland soils. The application of halophytes in the vegetation restoration of salinized soils has received increasing attention. However, limited studies are available concerning whether AM fungi are effective in improving wetland halophyte performance in salinized wetland soils. A pot experiment was conducted to quantitatively analyze the potential role of 3 AM fungal species (Funneliformis mosseae, Rhizophagus intraradices, and Diversispora tortuosa) on the growth, nutritional status, salt uptake, ionic homeostasis, osmotic substance synthesis, and antioxidant enzyme activities of Suaeda glauca (Bunge) grown in salinized wetland soils. The rhizosphere soil properties (i.e., extractable glomalin protein content and pH) were also analyzed after harvest. The results showed that mycorrhizal symbiosis significantly increased the S. glauca biomass and shoot Na+ accumulation by 28.6%-73.8% and 28.1%-135%, respectively, with D. tortuosa being more effective than F. mosseae or R. intraradices. Mycorrhizal symbiosis substantially increased the nutrient uptake, soluble protein and proline content, and SOD and CAT activity while significantly decreasing the MDA content, effects that can help S. glauca resist and adapt to salinized conditions. Counterintuitively, mycorrhizal symbiosis had marginal (even significantly negative) effects on the mitigation of the ionic ratios (e.g., K+/Na+ and P/Na+), which may be attributed to the increase in Na+ accumulation and translocation from roots to shoots. Mycorrhizal symbiosis significantly increased the rhizosphere soil TEG content and decreased the soil pH. These results enhance our understanding of the functional importance of AM fungi in improving halophyte performance and suggest the potential use of AM fungi in the revegetation of salinized wetland soils.																			0929-1393	1873-0272				OCT	2021	166								104065	10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.104065	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.104065		MAY 2021											WOS:000679311300011

Understanding energy system utilization for the classification of a competitive swimmer (sprint or distance) may be useful for both training prescription and event specialization. The relationship between anaerobic swim ergometer testing and adolescent sprint swimming performance has not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance and physiological responses during a maximal all-out ergometer test as well as the maximal anaerobic lactate test in a group of sprint vs. middle-distance specialized swimmers. Sixteen (n = 16) competitive swimmers (mean +/- standard deviation (SD), age 16.8 +/- 0.7 year; body mass 67.3 +/- 9.8 kg) were categorized into two gender matched groups: sprint (n = 8) and middle-distance (n = 8). Each athlete performed (1) a 45 s swim ergometer maximal test to determine peak and mean power output (Watts (W)), (2) a MANLT test to determine peak and average velocity as well as the post-exercise lactate response, and (3) a 50 m swim time trial. The sprint group showed a higher mean (p = 0.026) and peak (p = 0.031) velocity during the MANLT. In addition, blood lactate concentration was significantly (p < 0.01) higher in the sprint vs. middle-distance trained group at 3 and 12 min after completion of the MANLT (3-min post 11.29 +/- 2.32 vs. 9.55 +/- 3.48 mmol/L; 12-min post 8.23 +/- 2.28 vs. 7.05 +/- 2.47 mmol/L). The power output during the 45 s all-out swimming ergometer test was higher in the sprint trained group. The results of this study demonstrate the anaerobic contribution to sprint swimming measured during an all-out dryland ergometer test.

Attenuation of these connectivity feedbacks would ostensibly be required to restore transitioned ecosystems to their former state. We compared structural, hydrologic, and sediment connectivity on a shrub-encroached semi-arid grassland in south-eastern Arizona, USA, to that of a nearby site experiencing an increase in non-native perennial grass (Lehmann lovegrass) abundance 5-year following treating shrubs with tebuthiuron herbicide. Soil/vegetation attributes were quantified and paired with hydrologic experiments at fine (0.5 m(2)) to hillslope (50 m(2)) scales. Fine-scale rainfall simulations (120 mm.h(-1) rainfall intensity; 45 min) showed interspaces between shrubs were hydrologically similar on the treated and control sites, whereas herbicided shrub patches were more resource conserving than those within the control (terminal infiltration rates of 105 and 71 mm.h(-1), respectively). High structural connectivity of bare ground (basal gap lengths >200 cm) was correlated with increased concentrated flow run-off and accompanied by greater sediment yields within the untreated site at a coarse scale (similar to 9 m(2)). Hillslope-scale modelling suggested a divergence between hydrologic and sediment connectivity: run-off from high intensity rainfall was similar between sites, while predicted sediment yield was 44% less within the tebuthiuron-treated site. Our results indicate (i) hydraulic properties of soils between shrubs are unresponsive to herbicide treatment, (ii) disruption of structural connectivity of these interspaces associated with grass cover increases subsequent to herbicide application attenuated run-off and the energy needed for sediment transport, and (iii) sediment connectivity is reduced by conversion to a novel grassland ecological state.

The present study was conducted to identify the defense proteins in seed extrudes of 25 biofortified (Fe and Zn) inbred lines, and investigate their efficacy against blast (isolates Pg 45, Pg 138, and Pg 186) and downy mildew (isolates Sg 409, Sg 445, and Sg 576) diseases. The study revealed the presence of cysteine protease inhibitors (4.3-58.5 units/mg) as well as pathogenesis-related (PR) hydrolases including chitinases (5.3-16.3 units/ml), beta-1,3-glucanases (7.3-32.9 units/mg), and cellulases (0.19-4.11 units/mg) in the test lines. The activity levels of cystatins and PR hydrolases in the pearl millet lines were in relative consistency with the resistance levels observed in the greenhouse screenings against blast and downy mildew diseases. Furthermore, antifungal screenings of seed proteins against blast pathogen exhibited a significant reduction in radial growth of Pg 138 (57%) followed by Pg 186 (13%) and Pg 45 (10%). Spectrophotometric assays (A(595)) exhibited significant retardation in spore germination and initial growth (48 h) of Pg 45 (53.8-87.3%) followed by Pg 186 (19.2-61.3%) and Pg 138 (1.5-36.7%). Furthermore, seed proteins of biofortified lines efficiently reduced the downy mildew disease incidence in greenhouse screenings by seed treatments of susceptible pearl millet lines ICMP 451 (0.6-36% against Sg 409; 32-61% against Sg 576) and 7042R (14-80% against Sg 445). The results of this study will provide insight into the biochemical basis of resistance in pearl millet against foliar blast and downy mildew diseases, and to exploit novel strategies for breeding for disease resistance.

Currently, there are two major approaches to quantify the watershed exposure: monitoring and modeling. Watershed monitoring is expensive, and short-term monitoring is difficult to be used to address potential long-term exposure variability. Model simulation is widely used because not only can it save time and efforts, but it can also simulate the environmental transport process of pesticide over a long time frame to better understand temporal variability. Research on application of commonly used pesticide exposure assessment models such as PRZM, RICEWQ on watershed scale has found that those models need to be coupled together with waterbody models to assess pesticide exposure at the watershed level, and they are applied on a single crop in targeted area within a watershed, failing to consider the diversity of regional and watershed cropping conditions. To address pesticide exposure assessment in different waterbodies after application on multiple crops within a watershed, this study coupled PRZM, RICEWQ, and SWAT models simultaneously in North Tiaoxi watershed. PRZM model and RICEWQ model were used to simulate the exposure of pesticides in dryland and rice paddies separately, and the pesticide masses through runoff, overflow, spray drift, and other routes simulated by the above two models were set as the input of SWAT model which could simulate hydrology and pollutant transport at watershed scale. Pesticide use, cropping, hydrology, and watershed data were collected, and parameterized for exposure modeling of carbaryl in the North Tiaoxi River after uses on orchard, corn, and rice within the watershed. Model predictions showed high degree of agreement between the simulated results and the field monitoring data. The coupled PRZM, RICEWQ, and SWAT model could simulate reasonably well pesticide exposures in waterbodies with applications on multiple crops within a watershed.

The adoption of lentil in production systems and in plant-based diets is a food system solution that can support the environmental, socio-economic, and human health dimensions of sustainability. The purpose of this study is to evaluate producer and consumer perceptions of the sustainability profile of the lentil system in Montana (USA), and the surrounding region that includes Idaho (USA), North Dakota (USA), Washington (USA), and Canada, in the context of global change. Surveys were conducted with lentil producers (n = 63; conventional n = 42, organic n = 15, and mixed management n = 6) and consumers (n = 138) in the rural state of Montana (USA). The most prevalent agronomic reason for including lentil in production systems reported by producers is to diversify crop rotation (92%). The most prevalent economic reasons for including lentil in rotation reported by producers is to capitalize on dryland production (95%) and to serve as a cash crop (87%). With respect to lentil consumption, the most prevalent health-related perceptions were that eating lentils helps to improve nutrition (88%), feel satiated or full (85%), and support a plant-based diet (81%). Consumers and non-consumers of lentils alike reported they would increase lentil consumption based on environmental (78%), economic (75%), and health and nutrition (72%) information contrasting lentils and animal-based protein sources. Overall, findings highlight how the lentil system supports multiple dimensions of sustainability based on the perspectives of study informants. Additionally, findings elucidate barriers and opportunities for promoting lentil in agricultural systems and diets. Impacts of market, policy, and climate change on lentil production, and lack of consumer knowledge on benefits of lentils to help meet food security through a sustainable diet, challenge sustainability dimensions of lentil in the food system.

The interplay between facilitation and habitat type drives spatial vegetation patterns in global drylands	ECOGRAPHY												The spatial configuration of vascular vegetation has been linked to variations in land degradation and ecosystem functioning in drylands. However, most studies on spatial patterns conducted to date have focused on a single or a few study sites within a particular region, specific vegetation types, or in landscapes characterized by a certain type of spatial patterns. Therefore, little is known on the general typology and distribution of plant spatial patterns in drylands worldwide, and on the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors as predictors of their variations across geographical regions and habitat types. We analyzed 115 dryland plant communities from all continents except Antarctica to: 1) investigate the general typology of spatial patterns, and 2) assess the relative importance of biotic (plant cover, frequency of facilitation, soil amelioration, height of the dominant species) and abiotic (aridity, rainfall seasonality and sand content) factors as predictors of spatial patterns (median patch size, shape of patch-size distribution and regularity) across contrasting habitat types (shrublands and grasslands). Precipitation during the warmest period and sand content were particularly strong predictors of plant spatial patterns in grasslands and shrublands, respectively. Facilitation associated with power-law like and irregular spatial patterns in both shrublands and grasslands, although it was mediated by different mechanisms (respectively soil ammelioration and percentage of facilitated species). The importance of biotic attributes as predictors of the shape of patch-size distributions declined with aridity in both habitats, leading to the emergence of more regular patterns under the most arid conditions. Our results expand our knowledge about patch formation in drylands and the habitat-dependency of their drivers. They also highlight different ways in which facilitation affects ecosystem structure through the formation of plant spatial patterns.

Vegetation and precipitation shifts interact to alter organic and inorganic carbon storage in cold desert soils	ECOSPHERE												Dryland ecosystems are experiencing shifts in rainfall and plant community composition, which are expected to alter cycling and storage of soil carbon (C). Few experiments have been conducted to examine long-term effects on (1) soil organic C (SOC) pools throughout the soil profile, and (2) soil inorganic C (SIC) pools as they relate to dynamic changes in C storage and climate change. We measured SOC and SIC from 0 to 1 m beneath plants and in adjacent interplant microsites following nearly 20 yr of experimental manipulations of plant community (native sagebrush steppe or monoculture of exotic crested wheatgrass) and the amount and timing of water availability (ambient, or doubling of annual rainfall in the dormant, DORM, or growing, GROW, season). Under sagebrush plants, GROW increased both SOC and SIC pools, resulting in total carbon (TC) pools 15% greater than plots receiving ambient precipitation, while DORM decreased SOC and SIC pools, decreasing TC pools 20% from ambient. Under crested wheatgrass plants, GROW increased SOC by 73% but decreased SIC by 11% relative to ambient, netting no change in TC pools, while DORM SIC pools were 5% greater than ambient, with no significant increase in either SOC or TC pools. GROW significantly increased TC pools for interplant microsites, regardless of vegetation treatment. At the community scale and summing C pools weighted by percent patch cover, patterns of TC pool were similar to plot measurements. Our findings suggest that sagebrush communities can become a net C source to the atmosphere with increases in dormant season rainfall rather than a C sink as previously predicted. We also provide evidence of SIC as an important and dynamic C sequestration mechanism in drylands. Consideration of vegetation type, all or most of the soil profile, and both organic and inorganic C pools are all important to accurately predict C sequestration with changing climate and disturbance in drylands.

Loss can be reduced by separating processes and providing a suitable mathematical model for each of them by examining and measuring the factors influencing loss and optimizing their function. This model is then to be used for the purposes of controlling the system. An important process that has a significant impact on combine loss is the cleaning system. This study modelled and optimized the function of a cleaning system using response surface methodology (RSM). Feed rate, fan speed, and upper sieve opening were considered independent variables; the percentage of grain passage, content of materials-other-than-grains (MOG), and semi threshed cluster (s.t.c.) passing through the upper sieve were viewed as dependent variables. The results showed a significant effect of all three independent variables on the percentage of free grains with a probability level of 0.01. However, not all interactions were significant. Moreover, it was found that only mechanical factors had a significant effect on the percentage of s.t.c. passing, while fan speed and all interactions showed no significant effect. All three independent variables significantly affected the MOG content passing. An appropriate exponential model was found for all three dependent variables. Subsequently, the optimal conditions were determined for the maximum passage of free grains through the upper sieve and the minimum MOG at 3.33 kg.s(-1) feed rate, 742 rpm fan speed, and an upper sieve with 10 mm openings with a desirability of 0.84, based on RSM modelling.																			1335-2555	1338-5267				MAR 1	2022	25	1					20	26		10.2478/ata-2022-0004	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/ata-2022-0004													WOS:000771656500004
J	Murali, G; Iwamura, T; Meiri, S; Roll, U				Murali, Gopal; Iwamura, Takuya; Meiri, Shai; Roll, Uri			Future temperature extremes threaten land vertebrates	NATURE												The frequency, duration, and intensity of extreme thermal events are increasing and are projected to further increase by the end of the century(1,2). Despite the considerable consequences of temperature extremes on biological systems(3-8), we do not know which species and locations are most exposed worldwide. Here we provide a global assessment of land vertebrates' exposures to future extreme thermal events. We use daily maximum temperature data from 1950 to 2099 to quantify future exposure to high frequency, duration, and intensity of extreme thermal events to land vertebrates. Under a high greenhouse gas emission scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5 (SSP5-8.5); 4.4 degrees C warmer world), 41.0% of all land vertebrates (31.1% mammals, 25.8% birds, 55.5% amphibians and 51.0% reptiles) will be exposed to extreme thermal events beyond their historical levels in at least half their distribution by 2099. Under intermediate-high (SSP3-7.0; 3.6 degrees C warmer world) and intermediate (SSP2-4.5; 2.7 degrees C warmer world) emission scenarios, estimates for all vertebrates are 28.8% and 15.1%, respectively. Importantly, a low-emission future (SSP1-2.6, 1.8 degrees C warmer world) will greatly reduce the overall exposure of vertebrates (6.1% of species) and can fully prevent exposure in many species assemblages. Mid-latitude assemblages (desert, shrubland, and grassland biomes), rather than tropics(9,10), will face the most severe exposure to future extreme thermal events. By 2099, under SSP5-8.5, on average 3,773 species of land vertebrates (11.2%) will face extreme thermal events for more than half a year period. Overall, future extreme thermal events will force many species and assemblages into constant severe thermal stress. Deep greenhouse gas emissions cuts are urgently needed to limit species' exposure to thermal extremes.

Modeling the influence of daily temperature and precipitation extreme indices on vegetation dynamics in Katsina State using statistical downscaling model (SDM)	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Climate change significantly impacts local, regional, and global vegetation changes. These changes have continued to threaten ecosystems, especially in dryland areas where moisture is scarce, and the livelihoods of rural communities are at risk because of such changes, as well as their capacity to provide outputs and sustain the livelihoods of rural communities. This study aims to derive a simulation model of vegetation conditions concerning daily temperature and extreme precipitation indices in Katsina State, Nigeria. This study uses remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS)-based analysis, time series analysis of precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, and twenty-four indices defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection to evaluate the influence of Temp and precipitation extreme indices on vegetation dynamics/NDVI. The results indicate that the statistical downscaling model (SDSM) is performing satisfactorily in predicting maximum and minimum temperatures, along with precipitation, for the time horizon of the simulation. Mean precipitation of 1.98 mm (RCP2.6), 2.03 mm (RCP4.5), and 2.07 mm (RCP8.5) was revealed in the study area. Tmax and Tmin were projected under low emissions at 20.1 0C and 14.25 0C (RCP2.6), 20.13 degrees C and 14.26 0C (RCP4.5), and 20.15 0C and 14.27 0C (RCP8.5) respectively. All the scenarios present increasing minimum and maximum temperatures and decreasing precipitation, except for RCP8.5, which predicted a more adverse trend. However, in Katsina State, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), precipitation, Tmax, and Tmin, extreme temperature and precipitation indices, and drought indices successfully demonstrated spatial and temporal variability.

Bacteria living at this interface participate in almost all biogeochemical cycling processes that may profoundly alter soil and ecosystem multifunctionality and speed up ecosystem restoration. However, the successional dynamics of bacterial communities in both biocrusts and subsoil remain largely unclear.MethodsThis study used alpha and beta diversity assessments and molecular ecological networks to reveal the bacterial community succession in biocrusts and subsoil along a 65-year succession sequence (a succession of biocrust types ranging from cyanobacteria to lichens to mosses) on the southeastern edge of the Tengger Desert.ResultsOur results showed that the bacterial alpha and beta diversity and network complexity in the biocrusts and subsoil increased with succession. In the process of succession, there were distinct differences observed in bacterial community diversity and network complexity and stability between biocrusts and subsoil. In particular, the subsoil bacterial network properties, including nodes, links, average links per node, average clustering coefficient, connectance and relative modularity, were significantly higher than those of biocrust in late succession. Based on piecewise SEM, we also found that succession, soil physicochemical conditions, and biocrust bacterial community composition were the strongest direct drivers of subsoil bacterial community composition. The plant communities and biocrust bacterial community composition directly drove the network complexity and stability of the subsoil bacterial community.ConclusionOur findings indicate that under the cover and protection of the biocrust layer, the diversity of the bacterial community in the subsoil layer increased more obviously, and the network was more complex and stable. This may emphasize the important roles of biocrusts as mediators of soil microbial communities.																			0032-079X	1573-5036				2023 MAY 18	2023										10.1007/s11104-023-06071-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-023-06071-x		MAY 2023											WOS:000991713900001

It is crucial for understanding biodiversity maintenance mechanisms and for prescribing conservation measures. In this study, we aimed to reveal the drivers of beta diversity patterns in desert hinterland oasis communities by establishing three types of surface water disturbance and groundwater depth gradients. The results indicated that the dominant factor driving the beta diversity pattern within the same gradient shifted from soil organic matter to pH, as groundwater depth became shallower and surface water disturbance increased. Among the different gradients, surface water disturbance can have important effects on communities where original water resource conditions are extremely scarce. Under the premise that all habitats are disturbed by low surface water, differences in groundwater depth dominated the shifts in the community species composition. However, when groundwater depth in each habitat was shallow, surface water disturbance had little effect on the change in species composition. For the two components of beta diversity, the main drivers of species turnover pattern was the unique effects of surface water disturbance and soil environmental differences, and the main driver of species nestedness pattern was the common effect of multiple environmental pressures. The results of this study suggest that increasing the disturbance of surface water in dry areas with the help of river flooding will help in promoting vegetation restoration and alleviating the degradation of oases. They also confirm that surface water and groundwater mutually drive the establishment of desert oasis communities. Equal focus on both factors can contribute to the rational ecological recovery of dryland oases and prevent biodiversity loss.

However, little is known about how habitat degradation will impact multiple facets of biocrust diversity and measurable functional traits. We evaluated changes in taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of biocrust-forming lichens along a habitat degradation gradient related to the presence of linear infrastructure (i.e., a road) and a profound agricultural driven transformation. To do so, we selected 50 remnants of a Mediterranean shrubland. We considered several surrogates of habitat quality and causal disturbance on the various diversity facets of biocrusts by using structural equation modeling, hypothesizing that habitat degradation primarily affects functional diversity, which in turn regulates changes in taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities, and also that taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities are coupled. Fragment connectivity, distance to linear infrastructure (i.e., a road) and, particularly, soil fertility (i.e., soil P concentration), had mostly negative effects on biocrust functional diversity, which in turn affected both taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities. However, we found no direct effects of habitat degradation variables on the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities. We also found that increases in phylogenetic diversity had a positive effect on taxonomic diversity along the habitat degradation gradient. Our results indicate that functional diversity of biocrusts is strongly affected by habitat degradation, which may profoundly alter their contribution to ecosystem functioning and services. Furthermore, functional diversity regulates the response of biocrust taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity to habitat degradation. These findings indicate that habitat degradation alters and simplifies the diversity of functional traits of biocrust-forming lichens, leading to biodiversity loss, with important consequences for the conservation of global drylands biodiversity.

However, agricultural programming continues to rely on single point interventions framed by earlier development paradigms at odds with the systemic change goals of the SDGs. The implications of these colliding paradigms are explored using an agri-food systems lens to highlight trade-offs in interventions for pro-poor value chains, nutrition-sensitive value chains and greening of value chains. Analysis reveals problematic assumptions and limited supporting evidence and points to conflicting logics and targets that require societal negotiations about goals and priorities. Steps are outlined to embed a 'do no harm' principle in intervention design and evaluation.

Maesen, an annual wild relative belonging to the tertiary genepool of pigeonpea, possesses many useful traits such as early maturity, high protein content, photoperiod insensitivity, and pod borer tolerance for the genetic improvement of cultivated pigeonpea. Using this cross incompatible wildCajanusspecies, an advanced backcross population was developed following the embryo rescue technique. In the present study, a pre-breeding population consisting of 136 introgression lines (ILs) along with five popular varieties (used as checks) was evaluated for important agronomic traits during 2016 and 2017 rainy seasons and for grain nutrient content during 2016, 2017, and 2018 rainy seasons. Large genetic variation was observed for agronomic traits such as days to 50% flowering, number of pods per plant, pod weight per plant, grain yield per plant, and grain nutrients [protein content, grain iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg)] in the pre-breeding population. Significant genotype x environment interaction was also observed for agronomic traits as well as grain nutrients indicating the sensitivity of these traits to the environments. No significant correlations were observed between grain yield and grain nutrients except grain Zn content which was negatively correlated with grain yield. Overall, 28 promising high-yielding ILs with high grain nutrient content were identified. These ILs, in particular, ICPP # 171012, 171004, 171102, 171087, 171006, and 171050 flowered significantly earlier than the popular mega variety, ICPL 87119 (Asha) and thus hold potential in developing new short-duration cultivars. The comprehensive multi-site assessment of these high-yielding, nutrient-rich accessions would be useful in identifying region-specific promising lines for direct release as cultivars. Moreover, these ILs are expected to replace the popular existing cultivars or for use as new and diverse sources of variations in hybridization programs for pigeonpea improvement.																			1664-462X					JUL 23	2020	11								1055	10.3389/fpls.2020.01055	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2020.01055								32793254					WOS:000560138500001

They offer millions of women in the Global South the opportunity to provide protein-rich foods for home consumption and sale. Livestock provide women with income and opportunities to expand their livelihood portfolios and can strengthen women's decision-making power. Fully realizing livestock's empowerment potential for women is necessary for sustainable livestock development. It requires, though, that gender-equitable dynamics and norms are supported in rural communities. We draw on 73 village cases from 13 countries to explore women's experiences with livestock-based livelihoods and technological innovations. Our analysis follows a gender empowerment framework comprised of four interdependent domains-recognition of women as livestock keepers, access to resources, access to opportunities, and decision making as a cross-cutting domain-which must come together if women are to become empowered through livestock. We find improved livestock breeds and associated innovations, such as fodder choppers or training, to provide significant benefits to women who can access these. This, nonetheless, has accentuated women's double burdens. Another challenge is that even as women may be recognized in their community as livestock keepers, this recognition is much less common among external institutions. We present a case where this institutional recognition is forthcoming and illuminate the synergetic and empowering pathways unleashed by this as well as the barriers that remain.

Environmental Factors Influencing the Sustenance of the Camel Milk Value Chain in Isiolo County, Northern Kenya	RESOURCES-BASEL												Dryland areas in northern Kenya experience challenges due to various factors, including environmental degradation associated with unstable weather conditions and climate change. These and related risks and stressors are threats to the sustenance of camel milk production for many of Kenya's northern communities. We conducted a study among the pastoral communities in Isiolo County whose principal source of livelihood is dependent on camel production. In this paper, we discuss the drivers of the environmental factors influencing the resilience and sustainability of the camel milk value chain in Isiolo County, northern Kenya. We analyzed (i) the internal factors that influence the system, which includes: the categories and economic contributions of livestock-based value chains, the occupation of the camel milk value chain micro players, and land-use practices in Isiolo County, and (ii) the external factors influencing the system: the climatic variability (2014-2017) and its effect on the camel milk value chain, and the vegetation condition index (VCI) indicating drought trends for Isiolo County (2002-2020). The study adopted a field survey through interviews with randomly selected households involved in the camel milk value chain by using a survey questionnaire and a survey guide for focus group discussions (FGD) and key informant interviews (KII). The results from the study showed camel milk as a dominant value chain among the livestock-based value chain products in Isiolo County, the variations in quantities of camel milk supplied due to changes in seasonality, and we show that the current system is not sustainable. We conclude with recommendations to establish a modernized camel milk value chain based on improved natural resources management for a resilient and sustainable system.

E.; Lang, Simon C.; Werner, Mario			The interplay of fluvial, lacustrine and aeolian deposition and erosion along the Neales Cliffs and its relevance to the evolution of Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre, central Australia, during the Quaternary	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA												A high-resolution record of fluvial, aeolian and lacustrine deposits of Late Pleistocene age is exposed along the Neales Cliff in the lower reaches of the Nappamurra-Neales River, western Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre (KT-LE). Five major stratigraphic units reflect a variety of changes in sedimentary processes, depositional environments and hence palaeo-lake level fluctuations. This detailed record of a dryland terrestrial sedimentary succession in the northern part of KT-LE enables comparison to contemporaneous sequences in the southern part of KT-LE. The sedimentary record from the Neales Cliff area is placed into a continental stratigraphic framework, in which changes in sediment accumulation and depositional style are linked to climatically driven palaeo-lake level fluctuations independent of eustatic sea-level changes. Following the similar to 200 ka interglacial maximum, a drying-up systems tract is represented by a fluvial fining-upward trend, capped by palaeosols. A wettening-up systems tract followed, when lake level rose to +10 m AHD during the last interglacial, resulting in a lacustrine succession but punctuated by regular desiccation events. During the following drying-up systems tract, progressive lake-level fall resulted in deep incision around 100 ka, followed by enhanced fluvial deposition of fine-grained sediments. A brief rise in base level resulted in a wettening-up systems tract comprising a thin veneer of fluvial/alluvial sediments followed by extensive dune build-up and desert pavement development during the Last Glacial Maximum. Subsequent lake level fall to the present lake level of -15 m AHD, resulted in deep incision of up to 10 m by the modern day Nappamurra-Neales River.

The paper used data collected through a series of participatory methods including focus group discussions, questionnaire surveys and key informant interviews in 4 farming communities with different socioeconomic backgrounds in the Bongo and Talensi-Nabdam Districts of the Upper East Region. Results showed that farmers' adaptation to climate change and variability may be categorized under agricultural, water management, communal pooling and livelihood diversification techniques. Specific livelihood diversification adaptation practices identified in the study communities include charcoal or fuel wood sales, temporal and permanent migration to urban areas in search of non-existing jobs. Communal pooling, involving joint ownership and sharing of wealth, labor or incomes across households, is not widely practiced and should be enhanced. The findings showed that male and female farmers may engage in different set of adaptation practices to cope with climate change. Further, the results showed that farmers, especially female farmers, were constrained by a lack of property rights of farmlands, lack of credit facilities and lack of access to irrigation facilities, inadequate climate change information and inadequate seeds for planting. The paper recommends that farmers should be encouraged to form farmer-based associations to network socially, access credit facilities, land, insurance products, extension services and training to empower communities and women. Fostering peer exchange of information between communities will ensure best practices, and lessons learnt are shared and scaled-up. This paper contributes to the literature on mechanisms employed by farmers in dryland farming systems to cope with climate change and variability.

This research field provides scientific evidence and policy recommendations to improve land use quality and distribution. However, contemporary studies solely focus on construction land versus non-construction land competition, ignoring potential constraints from agriculture and ecology on parcel development. Using the land use situation of Zhengzhou City, this study comprehensively evaluated urban development suitability through hierarchical analysis, Delphi method, and eight-direction analysis. A multi-attribute overlay was applied with spatial restrictions from ecological protection and agricultural production, combined with urban expansion and development conditions. The results indicated that: (1) Ecological protection was critical for sustainable urban development, and areas like the Yellow River coast, northwest wetland, and southwest woodland were significant for ecological protection. High suitability areas for agricultural production were primarily located within the existing cultivated land. (2) Regarding urban expansion, the southeast of the city center was identified as the most suitable area, mainly covered by dryland. (3) Overall, the unsuitable, basically unsuitable, medium, suitable, and highly suitable areas for urban development covered 244, 921, 3024, 2224, and 944 km2, respectively. (4) The southeast-northwest direction showed prominent spatial characteristics for urban development suitability, while intensive development mode dominated the east-west direction of the city center. These findings provide significant guidance for land development and utilization, optimizing the spatial pattern, and formulating policies in Zhengzhou. Nevertheless, the weight calculation process presents a subjective factor that needs to be addressed in future research. More objective weight calculation results are necessary to achieve a more scientifically rigorous evaluation of urban development suitability.

However, few studies have considered improving the method of straw returning to balance soil and crops. A field experiment was conducted to investigate the dynamic changes in soil fertility and crop growth in winter wheat fields under different straw returning conditions. The experiment was conducted using a randomized block design with three replications. It spanned 3 years and five straw application treatments: no straw return (NS), half straw return (HS), full straw return (FS), full straw return + full film mulching (FFS), and full straw return + half film mulching (RPS) in a winter wheat single-cropping system. Straw returning increased the soil total nitrogen and soil organic carbon (SOC) contents in the topsoil. Compared with NS treatment, SOC content of FFS and RPS treatments increased by 15.57% and 13.06% on average, respectively, in the last 2 years of the study, with no significant difference between FS and HS treatments. Moreover, FFS treatment significantly increased the number of tillers and the aboveground biomass accumulation in the stems. Compared with NS, FFS treatments increased yield by 7.35-18.54% over 3 years by increasing spike number. In addition, FFS treatments increased water use efficiency by 1.89 mm kg ha(-1) in an average of 3 years compared with NS. Full straw return with full film mulching significantly increased the aboveground biomass accumulation and yield of winter wheat by improving soil moisture and nutrient content. Overall, these results provide valuable insights for improving straw management strategies to enhance nitrogen use efficiency and yield in dryland agricultural soils.

The scope of this research was to evaluate the maize hybrid yield, water productivity (WP; i.e. grain yield produced per unit of water consumed), and irrigation water productivity (IWP; i.e. increase in grain yield per unit of irrigation water applied) across a range of semiarid climatic conditions (i.e. drought, normal, and wet) and irrigation treatments. Total of 13 maize hybrids were evaluated under full irrigation (FI), deficit irrigation (DI, receiving similar to 50% less irrigation water than FI), and dryland (DRY; rainfall only) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Brule Water Laboratory near Brule, Nebraska, in 2011 and 2012 and Bayer's Gothenburg Water Utilization Learning Center near Gothenburg, Nebraska, in 2010 and 2011 (i.e. four site-years). Compared to FI, DI caused yield reduction of as much as 33% in a dry, 11% in a normal, and 2% in a wet year, resulting in consequently 22-47% improvement in IWP. Depending on site year and irrigation level, a difference of up to 7.2 t ha(-1), 3.6 kg m(-3), and 5.9 kg m(-3) was observed in yield, WP, and IWP, respectively, as a consequence of hybrid selection, with few top-performing hybrids yielding similarly under DI and FI in a normal and/or wet year. This study highlights the impact hybrid selection and DI have on crop water productivity (WP) and IWP as well as provides insight into strategies that can maintain productivity and profitability in water limited environments.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				FEB 1	2021	244								106610	10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106610	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106610													WOS:000603303900005

Drylands are one of the most abundant biomes on Earth, but extreme cases, such as deserts, are considered very rare in Europe. The so-called Tabernas Desert is one of the few examples of a desert area in continental Europe, and although some microbial studies have been performed on this region, a comprehensive strategy to maximize the isolation of environmental bacteria has not been conducted to date. We report here a culturomics approach to study the bacterial diversity of this dryland by using a simple strategy consisting of combining different media, using serial dilutions of the nutrients, and using extended incubation times. With this strategy, we were able to set a large (254 strains) collection of bacteria, the majority of which (93%) were identified through 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplification and sequencing. A significant fraction of the collection consisted of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, as well as Firmicutes strains. Among the 254 isolates, 37 different genera were represented, and a high number of possible new taxa were identified (31%), of which, three new Kineococcus species. Moreover, 5 out of the 13 genera represented by one isolate were also possible new species. Specifically, the sequences of 80 isolates held a percentage of identity below the 98.7% threshold considered for potentially new species. These strains belonged to 20 genera. Our results reveal a clear link between medium dilution and isolation of new species, highlight the unexploited bacterial biodiversity of the Tabernas Desert, and evidence the potential of simple strategies to yield surprisingly large numbers of diverse, previously unreported, bacterial strains and species.

Crop RS-Met: A biophysical evapotranspiration and root-zone soil water content model for crops based on proximal sensing and meteorological data	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Assessing crops water use is essential for agricultural water management and planning, particularly in water-limited regions. Here, we present a biophysical model to estimate crop actual evapotranspiration and root-zone soil water content using proximal sensing and meteorological data (Crop RS-Met). The model, which is based on the dual FAO56 formulation, uses a water deficit factor calculated from rainfall and atmospheric demand information to constrain actual evapotranspiration and soil water content in crops growing under dry conditions. We tested the Crop RS-Met model in a dryland experimental field comprising a variety of wheat (Tridcum aestivum L. and T. durum) cultivars with diverse phenology. Crop RS-Met was shown to accurately capture seasonal changes in wheat water use during the growing season. The average R-2 of modeled vs. observed soil water content for all cultivars (N = 11) was 0.92 0.02 with average relative RMSE and bias of 9.29 1.30% and 0.13 0.03%, respectively. We found that changing the integration time period of the water deficit factor in Crop RS-Met affects the accuracy of the model implying that this factor has a vital role in modeling crop water use under dry conditions. Currently, Crop RS-Met has a simple representation of surface runoff and does not take into consideration heterogeneity in the soil profile. Thus, efforts to combine numerical models that simulate soil water dynamics with a Crop RS-Met model driven by high-resolution remote sensing data may be needed for a spatially continuous assessment of crop water use in fields with more complex edaphic characteristics.

J	Liu, CG; Jia, XX; Bai, X; Shao, MA				Liu, Chenggong; Jia, Xiaoxu; Bai, Xiao; Shao, Ming'an			Analysis of soil water use by exotic and native vegetation in a semi-arid area and their associated interspecific competition	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The exotic vegetation used in dryland vegetation restoration projects is characterized by its fast-growing and deep-rooted system, which enables it to expedite the restoration of ecosystem functions and enhance biodiversity. However, the interspecific relationship between exotic and native vegetation and soil water uptake in these restored ecosystems remains unclear, limiting our ability to evaluate the succession process and sustainability of restored ecosystems. In this study, stable isotope techniques and a proportional similarity index were used to investigate soil water use strategies and interspecific relationships between exotic and native vegetation. The results showed significant differences between the soil water use strategies of both exotic and native vegetation between seasons and species, where the proportions of deep soil water (30-100 cm) used by exotic shrubs (Caragana korshinskii) and exotic grass (Medicago sativa) were significantly higher than those used by the cooccurring native grass (Stipa bungeana) (p < 0.05). As soil water storage declined, exotic vegetation increased its utilization of deep soil water, whereas native grasses relied more on surface water (0-10 cm). This suggests that deep-rooted exotic vegetation has greater adaptability and access to water resources than shallow-rooted native vegetation. However, a prolonged decline in soil water storage led to increased competition for surface soil water (0-30 cm) between the exotic and native vegetation. This may increase the risk of degradation of exotic vegetation, particularly in situations with lower soil water content in the deep layers. Overall, this study highlights the variation in water-use strategies and interspecies relationships between exotic and native vegetation and their implications for ecosystem succession, which provides valuable insights for developing future vegetation restoration strategies and managing restored ecosystems.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				DEC 20	2023	905								167066	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167066		SEP 2023						37709068					WOS:001079626500001
J	Obour, AK; Holman, JD; Assefa, Y				Obour, Augustine K.; Holman, Johnathon D.; Assefa, Yared			Grain sorghum productivity as affected by nitrogen rates and available soil water	CROP SCIENCE												Despite greater drought tolerance, soil water stress and low soil nitrogen (N) are major factors that affect sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) productivity and profitability in dryland environments. The main objective of this study was to determine the effects of available soil water at planting and N fertilizer on grain sorghum yield and net return. The study was conducted near Hays, KS, from Summer 1971 to Fall 2002. Treatments were four N rates (0, 22, 45 and 67 kg N ha(-1)) and depth of moist soil determined prior to sorghum planting each year. Results showed a -0.96, 14.4, 29.3, and 36.5 kg ha(-1) yield change per kg N applied for very low yielding (yield < 1,269 kg ha(-1)), low yielding (1,269< yield <2,611), high yielding (2,611< yield <3,986), and very high yielding (yield > 3,986 kg ha(-1)) environments, respectively. Sorghum yield increased by rates of 9.6 and 20.4 kg ha(-1) per mm increase in available soil water (ASW) at planting for 0 and 67 kg N ha(-1), respectively. A multilinear function showed that grain yield increased by 20 kg ha(-1) for each kg N ha(-1) applied, by 15 kg ha(-1) for each mm increase in ASW, and by 0.67 kg ha(-1) for each mm increase of in-season precipitation (ISP). Net return was negative for all environments when depth of moist soil at planting was <= 76 cm. We concluded that ASW prior to planting is critical for sorghum production and can be used to adjust sorghum N fertilizer rates early in the season.

M.			Phenology determines water use strategies of three economic tree species in the semi-arid Loess Plateau of China	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Economic tree species growing in the semi-arid Loess Plateau of China are important for maintaining sound economic viability and protecting the fragile hydro-ecological environment. However, their water use strategies and ecological adaptation to dryland environments remain poorly understood. In this study, we measured variations in soil water content, root distribution, water isotopic signature for hydrogen (delta H-2) and oxygen (delta O-18) in xylem and soil water of peach (Prunus persica), walnut (Juglans regia L.), and apple (Mattis pumila) trees, as well as carbon isotopic signature (delta C-13) in their leaves during two consecutive growing seasons-2018 (normal year) and 2019 (wet year). The results showed all species consumed less deep soil water in 2019 than in 2018 due to the increased precipitation. Peach trees used more shallow soil water compared to walnut and apple trees that used more deep soil water during high water-demanding periods. Walnut trees depended more on deep soil water throughout the growing season, contributing 46.2% in 2018, compared to 26.0% for peach trees and 24.0% for apple trees. Moreover, walnut trees had lower deep soil water and leaf delta C-13 than peach and apple trees. The findings suggest differences in phenology periods of the three rainfed economic tree species to affect the water source used. The three tree species differed in their water use strategies: walnut trees had ecological plasticity for reducing water stress by absorbing deep soil water, and peach and apple trees had higher water use efficiencies. This study has significance for evaluating water use characteristics and drought stress responses of economic trees in water-limited environments.					wu, wenjie/HKM-3623-2023; Si, Bing Cheng/H-8745-2012; wu, wenjie/IUN-9258-2023; Siddique, Kadambot H.M./B-3462-2011; Andersen, Mathias Neumann/A-7658-2008; Manevski, Kiril/N-3534-2013	Si, Bing Cheng/0000-0002-7497-5033; Siddique, Kadambot H.M./0000-0001-6097-4235; Andersen, Mathias Neumann/0000-0003-3845-4465; Manevski, Kiril/0000-0003-2068-3040; Li, Yue/0000-0002-9358-8178; Chen, Guangjie/0000-0002-4518-7038													0168-1923	1873-2240				JAN 15	2022	312								108716	10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108716	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108716		NOV 2021											WOS:000724254300002
J	Garibotti, IA; Polo, MG				Garibotti, Irene A.; Gonzalez Polo, Marina			Divergence among biological soil crust communities developing under different environmental conditions	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question The distribution of biological soil crusts (BSCs) is critical for the functioning of dryland ecosystems. Recent studies have proposed alternative successional pathways to explain the spatial variability in BSCs. However, the influence of environmental filtering structuring BSC communities remains unclear. We asked how early BSC assembly varies in response to different abiotic selective factors and whether communities converge or diverge toward the structure of natural communities that develop in different microsites. Location Semiarid shrubland in Argentina. Methods We used experimental community assembly, starting with a diverse inoculum containing species pools from different microhabitats (vegetated and interspaces), and examined how single-factor manipulations (water, light and nitrogen) affect community structure under otherwise natural conditions. We repeated the experiment in consecutive years, and evaluated the similarities between the assembled communities and the natural ones from which the inoculum was derived. Results Frequent watering was essential for promoting BSC growth, and shading and N fertilization led to divergent community structures formed by BSC groups with different functional strategies. Cyanobacteria and cyanolichens dominated the N fertilizer treatment, while mosses and green algae thrived under shade conditions. These communities were similar to natural communities in interspaces and subcanopy microsites respectively. Differences between treatments in species richness and abundance were consistent across years. Conclusions The research presented here represents the first attempt to assemble multispecies BSC communities for testing ecological hypotheses. The results suggest the relevance of environmental filtering determining alternative BSC community configurations, probably related to physiology-based selection of the BSC components. The existence of divergent assembly patterns does not support the deterministic facilitative model of BSC development that has been widely applied across environments, advancing our previous understanding about BSC dynamics.																			1100-9233	1654-1103				JAN	2021	32	1							e12987	10.1111/jvs.12987	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvs.12987													WOS:000624605000002
J	Feng, Y; Hao, WP; Gao, LL; Li, HR; Gong, DZ; Cui, NB				Feng, Yu; Hao, Weiping; Gao, Lili; Li, Haoru; Gong, Daozhi; Cui, Ningbo			Comparison of maize water consumption at different scales between mulched and non-mulched croplands	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Plastic mulch can significantly improve soil water and temperature conditions in croplands, altering ecohydrological processes in agroecosystems. Therefore, analysis of maize water consumption in response to plastic mulch is of importance to agricultural water management. A field experiment was conducted in non-mulched (CK) and mulched (PM) maize fields of eastern Loess Plateau to monitor maize evapotranspiration at different scales. Portable photosynthesis system, sap flow system and eddy covariance systems were utilized to measure transpiration rate at leaf scale, sap flow at plant scale and evapotranspiration (ET) at field scale, respectively. The results indicated PM provided a wetter condition (+2.8% and +4.2% in soil water content for two growing seasons respectively) for maize, leading to higher leaf area index, plant height and aboveground biomass under PM treatment. PM increased leaf transpiration by 9.8%(similar to)33.3% and sap flow by 1.4%(similar to)-34.5% under different weather conditions. However, seasonal ET and the ratio of soil evaporation to ET decreased from 326.3(similar to)341.1 mm and 39.9%(similar to)42.8% under CK to 305.0(similar to)313.9 mm and 23.8%(similar to)34.9% under PM respectively, indicating PM declined seasonal ET and altered ET components, as evaporation decreased while crop transpiration increased. Thus, more water was used for maize growth, finally resulted in significantly higher yield and water use efficiency (p < 0.05). Our results shed light on how plastic mulch saves water and improves water use efficiency, which can provide important information for crop production modeling, water balance evaluation and sustainable management of dryland farming in this area.						hao, weiping/0000-0003-1102-9119; Feng, Yu/0000-0001-6433-5035; Cui, Ningbo/0000-0002-9437-7284; gong, daozhi/0000-0002-3198-9929													0378-3774	1873-2283				MAY 1	2019	216						315	324		10.1016/j.agwat.2019.02.016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.02.016													WOS:000461262400029

Change in soil bacterial community during secondary succession depend on plant and soil characteristics	CATENA												Secondary succession has great impact on plant and soil characteristics, however, the trends of microbial patterns and the influencing factors during grassland succession without human disturbance remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the changes of bacterial community in sloped farmlands abandoned for 0, 20, 30, and 40 years (GL-0 yr, GL-20 yr, GL-30 yr, and GL-40 yr). Additionally, plant traits (coverage, diversity, richness, evenness, biomass, and biomass carbon) and soil nutrients were also determined. The results showed that soil bacterial alpha diversity was positively and significantly correlated with the succession time, and the secondary succession greatly affected soil bacterial beta diversity, in contrast, the effects on soil bacterial beta diversity at the late succession time (GL40 and GL30) were larger than that at the early succession time (GL20). For the bacterial taxa, the dominant phyla including Actinobacteria (34.8%), Proteobacteria (26.0%), Acidobacteria (15.0%), Chloroflexi (7.5%), Gemmatimonadetes (8.7%), Nitrospirae (1.6%), Bacteroidetes (2.1%), Verrucomicrobia (1.1%), and Planctomycetes (1.0%) were found. Particularly, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was higher at the late time (RP40), while the Actinobacteria was higher at the early time (RP20). Such different responses of bacterial diversity and taxa were largely explained by plant traits and soil nutrients, especially for TOC and TN. Collectively, our results indicate that plant secondary succession shifts the bacterial community structure, largely driven by changes in soil nutrients and plant diversity and composition, and also supported the growing view that soil bacterial community are the key determinants of aboveground and belowground linkages that functionally control terrestrial ecosystems.

J	Monjardino, M; Hochman, Z; Horan, H				Monjardino, Marta; Hochman, Zvi; Horan, Heidi			Yield potential determines Australian wheat growers' capacity to close yield gaps while mitigating economic risk	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												Australia's farmers are among the most efficient in the world, despite a relatively large gap between potential and achieved water-limited grain yield. With wheat yield gaps typically > 1.7 t/ha or 50% of the water-limited yield, it is important to investigate the degree to which this gap may be attributable to (rational) subprofit-maximising input levels in response to risk and risk aversion in many major grain-growing regions, particularly those with lower and more variable rainfall. Here, we use a set of 14 case study sites across the Australian wheatbelt to examine the risk-return profile of several agronomic management practices and show the extent to which the farmers' risk attitude determines their decision-making. Using a novel profit-risk-utility framework that incorporates crop simulation, probability theory, finance techniques and risk-aversion analysis, we were able to better demonstrate how farmers might select practices that manage economic risk across sites ranging from low to high rainfall. Results varied with risk preference and yield potential. However, there are real opportunities to close the yield gap by adopting non-limiting or near non-limiting nitrogen fertiliser practices and controlling fallow weeds. We show for the first time that yields associated with current best practice can be surpassed for most levels of risk aversion by adopting an emergent practice of optimising the site-specific time of sowing and matching variety to time of sowing. For some sites and risk profiles, the emerging best practice package which includes additional N fertiliser is also profitable under risk. We also propose a modified integrated framework for yield gaps. Here, we distinguish allocative input constrains due to risk aversion from those due to access to resources, and we account for an innovation gap where the current agronomic frontier is shifted upwards by growers successfully, implementing new technologies that are not yet part of current best practice.

Assessing plant production responses to climate across water-limited regions using Google Earth Engine	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Climate variability and change acting at broad scales can lead to divergent changes in plant production at local scales. Quantifying how production responds to variation in climate at local scales is essential to understand underlying ecological processes and inform land management decision-making, but has historically been limited in spatiotemporal scale based on the use of discrete ground-based measurements or coarse resolution satellite observations. With the advent of cloud-based computing through Google Earth Engine (GEE), production responses to climate can be evaluated across broad landscapes though time at a resolution useful for ecological and land management applications. Here, GEE was employed to synthesize a multi-platform Landsat time series (1988-2014) and evaluate relationships between the soil-adjusted vegetation index (a proxy for plant production) and climate across deserts and plant communities of the southwestern U.S. A "climate pivot point" approach was adopted in GEE to assess the trade-off between production responses to increasing wetness and resistances to drought at 30-m resolution. Consistent with a long-term seasonal climate gradient, production was most related to climate variance during the cool-season in the western deserts, during the warm-season in the eastern deserts, and equally related to both seasons within several desert areas. Communities dominated by grasses and deciduous trees displayed large production responses to an increase in wetness and low resistances to water deficit, while shrublands and evergreen woodlands had variable responses and high drought resistances. Production in plant communities that spanned multiple deserts responded differently to seasonal climate variability in each desert. Defining these plant production sensitivities to climate at 30-m resolution in GEE advances forecasts of how long-term climate trajectories may affect carbon storage, wildlife habitat, and the vulnerability of water-limited ecosystems.

A Global Meta-analysis Reveals that Nitrogen Addition Alters Plant Nutrient Concentration and Resorption in Grassland Ecosystems	JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION												Knowledge of plant nutrient strategies is crucial for defining and predicting the patterns and mechanisms resulting from nitrogen (N) deposition. However, the impacts of N enrichment on plant nutrient strategies are unclear in global grasslands. We conducted a meta-analysis of 127 publications to synthesize the pathways underlying the responses of plant nutrient concentration and resorption to N addition across global grassland ecosystems. Our analysis indicated that N addition increased the N concentration in green and senesced leaves, the phosphorus (P) concentration in senesced leaves, and aboveground and belowground biomass by about 32%, 50%, 7%, 74%, and 19%, respectively. Meanwhile, it reduced N resorption efficiency (NRE) and P resorption efficiency (PRE) by about 9% and 6%, respectively. Nitrogen addition did not significantly affect green leaf P concentration. These responses were modulated by N application rates and humidity, and they differed among grassland types, plant groups, fertilizer types, and experimental durations. Nitrogen addition changed the relationship between N and P in green leaves and between NRE and PRE, but it did not alter the N:P ratio in senesced leaves. Our results suggest that N addition affects leaf nutrient concentrations and resorption in global grassland ecosystems, although such effects vary among grassland types and among plant functional groups. Nutrient resorption may be a critical pathway that mediates plant regulation of the coupled N:P balance. Changes in humidity due to climate change also mediate the response of plant nutrients to N addition and thereby affect the soil-plant nutrient cycles of grassland ecosystems under future N enrichment.																			0718-9508	0718-9516				DEC	2022	22	4					4960	4971		10.1007/s42729-022-00973-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42729-022-00973-y		AUG 2022											WOS:000840057300001

Critical levels and nitrogen fertilizer equivalencies for grain protein in winter wheat	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Precision nitrogen (N) application methods have been developed for dryland wheat that utilize site-specific measurements of grain protein concentration (GPC) to determine N fertilizer recommendations for the next season. The objectives of this study were to determine the critical protein level and N equivalent to a unit change in GPC from relationships between GPC, and grain yield or plant-available N in soft white winter wheat (SWW, Triticum aestivum L.), and assess the consistency of these relationships across SWW cultivars grown under a wide range of precipitation. A 3-year study was undertaken near two sites: Lexington (225 mm of mean annual precipitation) and Adams (450 mm) in Oregon. Differences in precipitation and N fertilization rates between sites were used to induce variability in grain yield and GPC of four cultivars. A critical protein concentration of 117.5 g kg-1 was defined by Cate-Nelson analysis of scatter plots of relative yield versus GPC. Critical protein among cultivars ranged between 105 and 118 g kg-1 suggesting that 117.5 g kg-1 might be used as a general indicator of N sufficiency. Slopes of the regression of available N on GPC were consistent across cultivars and revealed that 4.2-8.4 kg N ha-1 is equivalent to a unit change protein (1 g kg-1) in lower precipitation areas of the region where SWW is under water stress during grain filling. This information is useful in calculating the N to apply from the GPC in the previous season to meet crop requirements in the next season. A critical grain protein level can indicate N sufficiency for yield of winter wheat under water stress.The N equivalent to a unit change in protein concentration is generalizable across winter wheat cultivars.Critical protein level and N equivalent to unit change in protein are useful for precision N management.																			0002-1962	1435-0645				2023 NOV 28	2023										10.1002/agj2.21499	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.21499		NOV 2023											WOS:001110680800001

However, changes in agricultural production conditions lead to strong uncertainties in agricultural GWF. Therefore, advanced methods to deal with these uncertainties for improving the accuracy of regional WPR assessment are required. By combining min-max/max-max programming models with a GWF assessment framework, an integrated uncertainty analysis method for agricultural GWF affected by production conditions was proposed in this study. Based on the method, extreme scenarios of GWF evaluation were established to obtain lower and upper bounds of agricultural GWF. The proposed method was applied in the Guangdong Province in South China, and the following results were obtained. Agricultural GWFs in the Guangdong Province were [124.67, 237.37], [110.63, 204.90], and [104.04, 178.01] Gm3 in 2005, 2010, and 2015, respectively. Different contributing factors of agricultural GWF were shown in the minimum and maximum GWF scenarios. For crop planting, the contribution of dryland and paddy fields to GWF was larger than that of garden land in the minimum GWF scenario, whereas the contribution of garden land was greatest in the maximum GWF scenario. For livestock and poultry breeding, the contribution of livestock raised under dry cleaning condition to the GWF was larger than that under flushing condition in the minimum GWF scenario, whereas the opposite situation was observed in the maximum GWF scenario. Based on the interval values of agricultural GWF, the WPR of the cities of Zhanjiang, Maoming, Yunfu, Chaozhou, Foshan, and Dongguan were identified as unacceptable. By identifying the uncertainties within agricultural GWF evaluation induced by the variability of production conditions, the proposed method can provide helpful information for agricultural planning in the context of sustainable agricultural development.

The potential of groundwater-dependent ecosystems to enhance soil biological activity and soil fertility in drylands	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Water availability controls the functioning of dryland ecosystems, driving a patchy vegetation distribution, unequal nutrient availability, soil respiration in pulses, and limited productivity. Groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) are acknowledged to be decoupled from precipitation, since their vegetation relies on groundwater sources. Despite their relevance to enhance productivity in drylands, our understanding of how different components of GDEs interconnect (i.e., soil, vegetation, water) remains limited. We studied the GDE dominated by the deep-rooted phreatophyte Ziziphus lotus, a winter-deciduous shrub adapted to arid conditions along the Mediterranean basin. We aimed to disentangle whether the groundwater connection established by Z. lotus will foster soil biological activity and therefore soil fertility in drylands. We assessed (1) soil and vegetation dynamics over seasons (soil CO2 efflux and plant activity), (2) the effect of the patchy distribution on soil quality (properties and nutrient availability), and soil biological activity (microbial biomass and mineralization rates) as essential elements of biogeochemical cycles, and (3) the implications for preserving GDEs and their biogeochemical processes under climate change effects. We found that soil and vegetation dynamics respond to water availability. Whereas soil biological activity promptly responded to precipitation events, vegetation functioning relies on less superficial water and responded on different time scales. Soil quality was higher under the vegetation patches, as was soil biological activity. Our findings highlight the importance of groundwater connections and phreatophytic vegetation to increase litter inputs and organic matter into the soils, which in turn enhances soil quality and decomposition processes in drylands. However, biogeochemical processes are jeopardized in GDEs by climate change effects and land degradation due to the dependence of soil activity on: specialIntscript precipitation for activation, and specialIntscript phreatophytic vegetation for substrate accumulation. Therefore, desertification might modify biogeochemical cycles by disrupting key ecosystem processes such as soil microbial activity, organic matter mineralization, and plant productivity.

Although numerous individual studies had been conducted, the global patterns of the changes in SOC concentration following BSCs establishment remain unclear. In this study, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of 184 independent observations at 47 sites to quantify the responses of SOC and other soil variables to BSCs establishment and identify the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that BSCs generally increased SOC by 70.9% compared to the controls (uncrusted soil), and the positive effects of BSCs on SOC in deserts (120.3%) were stronger than those in grasslands (32.7%). Mosses and lichens had a stronger positive effect on SOC than algae crusts (67.5%, 82.8%, and 58.2% respectively). Mixed crusts accumulated more SOC (181.6%) than single (moss, lichen and algae) crusts. The presence of BSCs considerably increased total nitrogen (TN) (+80.7%), total phosphorus (TP) (+20.3%), available N (+62.7%), and available P (+14.3%). Significant relationships were observed among the effect size of SOC and climate and soil N and Pin both desert and grassland. The random forest analysis showed that TN could be considered as a determinant of the concentration of SOC, followed by climate (P < 0.01). Our study shows that the capacity of the BSCs to fix and store C could be regulated by soil N and P dynamics, indicating a major finding opening new ways to promote soil recovery and formation. Our findings highlight the remarkable contribution of mixed crusts to soil C pools; this contribution needs to be incorporated into regional and global models to predict the effects of human disturbance on drylands worldwide and for assessing the soil C budget.

This study aimed to reveal genetic control of yield and yield components in the two cultivars under both dryland and irrigated conditions. A mapping population containing 124 F-5:7 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed from the cross of TAM 112/TAM 111. A set of 5,948 SNPs from the wheat 90K iSelect array and double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing was used to construct high-density genetic maps. Data for yield and yield components were obtained from 11 environments. QTL analyses were performed based on 11 individual environments, across all environments, within and across mega-environments. Thirty-six unique consistent QTL regions were distributed on 13 chromosomes including 1A, 1B, 1D, 2A, 2D, 3D, 4B, 4D, 6A, 6B, 6D, 7B, and 7D. Ten unique QTL with pleiotropic effects were identified on four chromosomes and eight were in common with the consistent QTL. These QTL increased dry biomass grain yield by 16.3 g m(-2), plot yield by 28.1 g m(-2), kernels spike(-1) by 0.7, spikes m(-2) by 14.8, thousand kernel weight by 0.9 g with favorable alleles from either parent. TAM 112 alleles mainly increased spikes m(-2) and thousand kernel weight while TMA 111 alleles increased kernels spike(-1), harvest index and grain yield. The saturated genetic map and markers linked to significant QTL from this study will be very useful in developing high throughput genotyping markers for tracking the desirable haplotypes of these important yield-related traits in popular parental cultivars.

However, the effect of different farmland mulching on soil bacterial communities is not clear. Therefore, the impact of a 5-year field management practice (surface mulching) on the soil bacterial communities was studied in dryland farmland of the Loess Plateau by using Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The following treatments were investigated: (1) ridge-furrow mulching pattern; (2) flat plastic film mulching; (3) flat biodegradable film mulching; (4) flat straw mulching; and (5) control (CK), conventional flat planting without mulch. All farmland mulching increased the diversity of soil bacteria and the diversity was greatest under the plastic film treatment. The dominant phyla across all soil samples were Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Cluster analyses showed that bacterial communities under mulching treatments were different from that of CK. The bacterial community composition of plastic film and straw mulching treatments, biodegradable film and ridge-furrow mulching treatments were similar at the phylum level. Spearman correlation analysis indicated that the response of bacterial alpha-diversity was mainly negatively associated with the soil organic carbon and total nitrogen. The Mantel test showed that the beta-diversity depended primarily on the soil total nitrogen and soil temperature. The changes of the bacterial community distribution were significantly related to the soil moisture, which varied significantly with a range of 9.8-17.3 between treatments. These results indicated that soil properties changed after long-term farmland mulching, and these changes were related to soil bacterial diversity and community structure. According to this study, flat plastic firm mulching was found to being a good option for increasing soil bacterial diversity and richness and thereby potentially stabilize functional stability of soil biological processes.

Prospects for improving perennial legume persistence in mixed grazed pastures of south-eastern Australia, with particular reference to white clover	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE					Australian-Grassland-Association (AGA) Research Symposium on Soil Constraints on Pasture Productivity	FEB 12-14, 2019	Launceston, AUSTRALIA	Australian Grassland Assoc				This review examines the prospect of improving perennial legume adaptation to grazed mixed pasture swards across the higher-altitude regions of south-eastern Australia through improved management, particularly as it relates to soil fertility. The range of adapted perennial species available to farmers often remains limited to only one perennial forage legume species, white clover (Trifolium repens L.). Despite recent advances in cultivars for increased persistence in dryland environments, white clover remains sensitive to drought with its inherently shallow root system and limited capacity to restrict water loss from herbage. With few alternative species likely to become widely available in the foreseeable future, prospects for extending the boundaries of perennial legume adaptation likely rely on a dual approach of improving soil fertility and further genetic improvement in white clover. Improved soil fertility would focus on overcoming soil acidity and addressing nutrient deficiencies, particularly of phosphorus, potassium, boron and molybdenum, which tend to be more widespread in the target region. Addressing these soil constraints would alleviate periodic moisture stress by: (1) increased water availability through improved infiltration and soil hydraulic properties; (2) increased root growth to maximise exploration of the soil volume; and (3) better maintenance of plant cell structures to foster improved osmotic regulation. However, the extent to which white clover adaption may be extended remains an issue of further research. This review highlights an opportunity for further genetic improvement of white clover by focusing on improving the capacity to recover from periodic droughts through seedling regeneration. Further breeding efforts in white clover should examine the feasibility of selecting for hard seed characteristics more similar to the best-adapted subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) cultivars across this region to promote ongoing seedling regeneration.

However, the effects of vegetation coverage on the overland flow resistance mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to examine the impact of grass and shrub cover on the resistance to overland flow concerning a random patch distribution pattern. This was achieved through a series of simulated rainfall experiments. Thirty slope surfaces with different vegetation coverages, consisting of complete combinations of five grass and six shrub coverages, were tested under five rainfall intensities (60-120 mm h(-1)) and three slope gradients (8.75%-26.79%). The results indicated that the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor (f) values on unvegetated slopes ranged from 0.455 to 1.385, whereas those on vegetated slopes ranged from 0.500 to 5.624. Vegetation coverage increased flow resistance on hillslopes, and the relationship between f and the Reynolds number (Re) was influenced by vegetation cover and the slope gradient; thus, it showed a positive correlation when vegetation form resistance was dominant. In contrast, a negative correlation was observed. According to the t-test results, the linear superposition method had limitations in calculating overland flow resistance and was only applicable when the grass coverage was 10%. Moreover, as the coverage increased, significant differences (p < 0.05) emerged between the total resistance and the linear summation of the individual resistance components. Additional vegetation resistance plays a significant role in impeding the water flow, contributing up to 50% of the total resistance. Finally, an equation for calculating additional vegetation resistance was developed using dimensional analysis and multiple nonlinear regression. The accuracy of the equation was validated by comparing it with experimental results (NSE = 0.918, RMSE = 0.144). These findings emphasize the effectiveness of constructing grass-shrub communities and increasing vegetation coverage as measures for soil and water conservation.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2023	626		B						130285	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.130285	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.130285													WOS:001107419800001

Ryan; Kallenbach, Robert L.; Yuan, Zhiyou			Changes in grassland phenology and growth rate, rather than diversity, drive biomass production after fire	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Plant phenology and growth rate are sensitive bio-indicators of climate change and anthropogenic disturbances. Fire is widespread in many ecosystems worldwide. Understanding how plant growth varies in its response to fire disturbance is critical for fire management. Despite the effects of fire on various aspects of plant ecology, such as the composition and growth of vegetation, little is known about the impact of fire on biomass production resulting from changes in functional group composition, plant phenology, and growth rate. Prescribed-burning of three types of grassland along an aridity gradient in Inner Mongolia, China, did not significantly affect species richness or the relative abundance of various functional groups across the three grasslands. Fire-induced advancement (-3 weeks) and elongation (-2 weeks) of growing periods increased perennial grass and community production in the low aridity grassland (aridity index, AI = 0.38). In contrast, marginal changes in phenology did not influence production in the moderate aridity grassland (AI = 0.27). Post-fire delayed and shortened growing period by -5 and 4 weeks respectively and thus reduced community production in the high aridity grassland (AI = 0.20). Post-fire plant growth rate was reduced by -44% in the low aridity grassland but was enhanced by 20-100% in the moderate and high aridity grasslands. The opposing effects of fire on growth rate vs. phenological responses largely negated any overall effect on community production. Our results indicate that phenology and growth rate rather than diversity were the primary contributors to the variation in production after fire. We provide new empirical evidence that prescribed-burning would not be a suitable management tool in extremely arid grasslands because it delays growing period and reduces production, both of which may influence grazing time and intensity. Our findings highlight the compensatory effects of plant phenology and growth rate on the regulation of biomass production.

Loessial soil from the Loess Plateau was tested to produce different antecedent crusts under simulated rainfall intensities (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 mm/min, typical storm intensity in the area), and then the effects of antecedent crusts on sheet erosion processes were quantified at a rainfall intensity of 1.5 mm/min. The results showed that the bulk density and hardness of antecedent crusts were higher than those of soil. Particle sizes of crusts were smaller than those of soil at light rain intensity but larger under heavy rain intensity. The bulk density, hardness, and particle size D-50 of the antecedent crust were all positively correlated with rainfall intensity, being well described by linear equations (R-2 > 0.87), while the thickness was negatively linearly correlated with rainfall intensity (R-2 = 0.88). Although the existence of antecedent crusts could decrease the infiltration and increase the runoff, resulting in the high flow velocity and stream power, antecedent crusts could still effectively reduce sheet erosion. The reductions in the average infiltration rate and average erosion rate and the increases of average flow velocity and stream power all increased with the increment of bulk density of antecedent crust. Relationships could be all well described by linear positive correlations (R-2 > 0.79). When the bulk density of crust was enhanced by 27 similar to 29%, the flow velocity and stream power could be increased by 8 similar to 29% and 15 similar to 70%, and the sheet erosion could be reduced by 61 similar to 73%. The existence of crust could effectively reduce sheet erosion. These results could help understand the mechanism of the erosion process in the presence of physical crusts.																				2296-665X				JUL 5	2022	10								905045	10.3389/fenvs.2022.905045	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.905045													WOS:000828764900001

EUPHYTICA												Multi-environment testing at five locations for rust and late leaf spot (LLS) resistance with 41 introgressed lines (ILs) bred using marker-assisted backcross breeding in the genetic background Spanish-type groundnut varieties identified significant genotype, and genotype x environment interactions (GEI) for LLS disease resistance and yield parameters. Significant GEI effects suggest the need to identify location specific breeding lines to achieve gains in pod yield and LLS resistance. The observed variable LLS disease reaction among the ILs in part suggests influence of background genotype on the level of resistance. A breeding scheme with early generation selection using molecular markers followed by phenotyping for LLS, and multi-location testing of fixed breeding lines was optimized to enhance selection intensity and accuracy in groundnut breeding. The ILs, ICGVs 14431, 14436 and 14438 with pooled LLS score at 90 DAS of 3.5-3.7 were superior to respective recurrent parent for pod yield, with early maturing similar to recurrent parents. The pod yield advantage in ILs is attributed by more number of pods, besides resistance to LLS that contributes to better filling.

The widespread soil-inhabiting mole cricket on the northern Loess Plateau creates subterranean tunnels, damages topsoil structures, and likely alters soil infiltration, erosion, and evaporation. In this study, we assessed the effect of adult and immature mole crickets (Gryllotalpa unispina Saussure; Orthoptera: Gryllotalpidae) on soil water evaporation in loam soil. A series of simulation experiments was conducted in iron buckets (20 cm in diameter and 20 cm high) filled with disturbed soil at the Shenmu Erosion and Environment Research Station. The soil was saturated and drained until the water content approached the field moisture capacity (25.3%), and then the soil was subjected to evaporation for 58 days. Evaporation was found to occur in two stages. In the first 18 days, daily evaporation in soil with adult and immature mole crickets was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than that in soil without mole cricket. Compared with bare soil treatment, the cumulative evaporation of soil treated with adult and immature mole crickets decreased by 24.6% and 13.9%, respectively. In the second stage, daily evaporation in soil treated with mole cricket was greater than that in bare soil due to the higher soil moisture in treatments with mole cricket in the first stage. Under the condition of continuous drought, mole cricket activity had a lag effect on soil water evaporation. The effects of mole cricket activity on soil evaporation depended on the soil-surface disturbance area, i.e., a larger disturbance area corresponded to more greatly reduced soil-evaporation function. These results can help elucidate the effects of soil-inhabiting insects on water movement in semiarid areas.

R. Br.]	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Forty-five African or Asian origin pearl millet populations bred either in Africa or Asia were investigated to generate information on heterotic pools. They were clustered into seven groups (G1 to G7) when genotyped, using 29 highly polymorphic SSRs. Fourteen parental populations representing these seven marker-based groups were crossed in diallel mating design to generate 91 population hybrids. The hybrids evaluated at three locations in India showed mean panmictic mid-parent heterosis (PMPH) and better-parent heterosis (PBPH) for grain yield ranging from -21.7 to 62.08% and -32.51 to 42.99%, respectively. Higher grain yield and heterosis were observed in G2xG6 (2462 kg ha(-1), 43.2%) and G2xG5 (2455 kg ha(-1), 42.8%) marker group crosses compared to the most popular Indian open-pollinated variety (OPV) ICTP 8203. Two heterotic groups, Pearl millet Population Heterotic Pool-1 (PMPHP-1) comprising G2 populations and Pearl millet Population Heterotic Pool-2 (PMPHP-2) comprising G5 and G6 populations, were identified based on hybrid performance, heterosis and combining ability among marker group crosses. Population hybrids from two heterotic groups, PMPHP-1xPMPHP-2 demonstrated PMPH of 14.75% and PBPH of 6.8%. Populations of PMPHP-1 had linkages with either African or Asian origin populations, whereas PMPHP-2 composed of populations originating in Africa and later bred for Asian environments. Results indicated that parental populations from the two opposite heterotic groups can be used as base populations to derive superior inbred lines to develop high yielding hybrids/cultivars.

However, regular N application decreases N use efficiency (NUE, the ratio of grain dry matter yield to N supply from soil and fertilizer). Various practices have been implemented to maintain high crop yield and improve NUE. Nowadays, the enhanced sowing method, i.e., wide space sowing (WS), has improved the productivity of wheat crops. However, how the sowing method and N application rate affect N use and yield productivity has not been fully elucidated. Field experiments with treatments using two sowing methods (WS, and drill sowing, DS) and four N application rates (0, 180, 240, and 300 kg ha-1, represented as N0, N180, N240, and N300, respectively) were conducted from 2017 to 2019. The results showed that grain yield under WS was 13.57-16.38% higher than that under DS. The yield advantage under WS was attributed to an increased ear number. Both the higher stem and productive stem percentage accounted for the increased ear number under WS. Higher total N quantity and larger leaf area index at anthesis under WS contributed to higher dry matter production, resulting in higher grain yield. Higher dry matter production was due to pre-anthesis dry weight and post-anthesis dry weight. The wheat crop under WS had a 12.44-15.00% higher NUE than that under DS. The increased NUE under WS was attributed to higher N uptake efficiency (the ratio of total N quantity at maturity to N supply from soil and fertilizer), which was the result of greater total N quantity. The higher total N quantity under WS was due to both higher pre-anthesis N uptake and post-anthesis N uptake. Remarkably, compared to DS with 240 kg N ha-1, WS with 180 kg N ha-1 had almost equal grain yield, dry matter, and total N quantity. Therefore, wheat crops under WS could achieve both high NUE and grain yield simultaneously with only moderate N fertilizer in South Shanxi, China.

J	Carrick, PJ				Carrick, Peter J.			Lessons from patch dynamics for ecology and restoration: The succulent Karoo, Sandveld example	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												A series of long-term field and glasshouse experiments were conducted in the semi-arid Sandveld Bioregion of southern Africa, across a wide range of post-mining site and soil conditions, on the two major plant groups, leafsucculent shrubs (LSS, which establish in open micro-habitats) and non-succulent shrubs (NSS, which establish in sheltered micro-habitats). Seeding experiments applied a sequential ecological framework intended to reduce the impact of impeding natural ecological processes whilst incorporating processes that facilitate plant establishment. Experimental plots were scaled to naturally operating ecological dynamics at the patch scale, and various potentially facilitative types of shelter and soil amelioration, tested separately. Results are reported over three or six year periods and from four or seven field sites. Shelter generally had a greater effect on plant establishment than soil ameliorants, but this could be either positive or negative, and varied for the two plant groups: LSS establishment was inhibited or neutral under all forms of shelter, NSS were facilitated by types of artificial shelter that could be removed or biodegraded without impacting young plants. Both groups were strongly inhibited under transplanted nurse plants. Water absorbing gels improved LSS establishment but other soil ameliorants had no effect, while milled kelp or nutrients improved NSS establishment (measured as a biomass index or plant abundance, respectively). Finally, site had a greater effect than either shelter or soil ameliorants, and could not be related to any soil or other factors measured, supporting recent studies that explicitly quantify the substantial unknown effects of site and year. Specific recommendations are made for comprehensive, seed-based, nucleated restoration designs for the Sandveld and similar bioregions, while the over-arching results are of universal import to dryland restoration and ecology.																			0140-1963	1095-922X				DEC	2023	219								105055	10.1016/j.jaridenv.2023.105055	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2023.105055		OCT 2023											WOS:001092975700001

This will undoubtedly have impacts on the biota of Australian dryland systems. However, accurate modelling of these impacts is presently impeded by a lack of empirical research on drought/heatwave effects on native arid flora and fauna. During the 2018-2021 Australian drought, many parts of the continent's inland experienced their hottest, driest period on record. Here, we present the results of a field survey in 2021 involving indigenous rangers, scientists and national parks staff who assessed plant dieback during this drought at Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park (UKTNP), central Australia. Spatially randomized quadrat sampling of eight common and culturally important plants indicated the following plant death rates across UKTNP (in order of drought susceptibility): desert myrtle (Aluta maisonneuvei subsp. maisonneuvei) (91%), yellow flame grevillea (Grevillea eriostachya) (79%), Maitland's wattle (Acacia maitlandii) (67%), waxy wattle (A. melleodora) (65%), soft spinifex grass (Triodia pungens) (53%), mulga (A. aneura) (42%), desert oak (Allocasuarina decaisneana) (22%) and quandong (Santalum acuminatum) (0%). The sampling also detected that seedling recruitment was absent or minimal for all plants except soft spinifex, while a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) indicated two-way interactions among species, plant size and stand density as important predictors of drought survival of adult plants. A substantial loss of biodiversity has occurred at UKTNP during the recent drought, with likely drivers of widespread plant mortality being extreme multi-year rainfall deficit (2019 recorded the lowest-ever annual rainfall at UKTNP [27 mm]) and record high summer temperatures (December 2019 recorded the highest-ever temperature [47.1 & DEG;C]). Our findings indicate that widespread plant death and extensive vegetation restructuring will occur across arid Australia if the severity and frequency of droughts increase under climate change.

This would allow them to use increased rainfall predicted by climate change, but might challenge the drought resistance of irrigated nursery-produced plants for revegetation. Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of a given genotype to produce different phenotypes in response to changing environmental conditions. Despite its high adaptive value, it may have a high cost in resource-poor ecosystems, restricting the ability of plants to take advantage of surplus resources, e.g., increased levels of precipitation. We aimed to determine the phenotypic plasticity to water availability of four woody species from a hot desert of South America. We carried out a pot experiment with two levels of irrigation in a glasshouse, where performance (biomass production, stem growth, survival) and functional traits (biomass allocation, total leaf area, leaf size, specific leaf area; stomata size, density and index; photoprotective and antioxidant compounds) were measured. The plasticity patterns differed between species, with the highest plasticity in leaf traits (around 80% change between treatments), and the lowest in biochemical traits (no significant variation between treatments). All four species increased their performance under high-water supply, with different magnitudes (the two phreatophytes > the two xerophytes). However, some of them showed increased allocation to stem biomass, increased total leaf area and leaf size, increased stomata size, and reduced root growth, potentially allowing them to use water for growth when it is available, although hampering their drought resistance, based on classic interpretation of traits' adaptive value. These changes promoted in irrigated nursery-produced seedlings should be considered in dryland revegetation plans. Moreover, our results suggest that the patterns of phenotypic plasticity would not be associated with the functional group of the species in relation to access of the water table in the field, but this issue needs to be explored further.

Seedlings of Acacia nilotica, Azadirachta indica, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Prosopis cineraria, P. juliflora, Tamarix aphylla, Salvadora persica, S. oleoides and Tecomella undulata were planted and irrigated with bore-well (BW) and treated wastewater (WW) at 1/2ET (Evaporation-transpiration) and 3/4ET. Plants irrigated at BW1/2 attained less height and collar diameter, and showed low growth increments and dry biomass. These variables increased by 1.2-2.0-fold at WW3/4 irrigation. Plants produced 1.4-fold higher biomass with WW over BW, whereas it was 1.5-fold higher at 3/4ET over 1/2ET. Responses of species to BW/WW irrigation differed in biomass allocation to roots and other parts as a mechanism to uptake water and nutrients. Conclusively, A. nilotica, A. indica, P. juliflora and T. aphylla had stronger preference to increased irrigation level, whereas E. camaldulensis, S. persica, S. oleoides and T. undulata had preferred nutrients added through treated wastewater. A. nilotica, E. camaldulensis, P. juliflora and A. indica were best species in growth and biomass production and wastewater utilization. These can be replicated in urban afforestation to enhance bio-product and reduce degradation in environmental quality. Novelty statement Wastewater (WW) is an alternative source of water in dryland afforestation. Wastewater was characterized and utilized in growing tree plantation in Indian arid zone. Plant growth and biomass increased with treated wastewater irrigation. Responses of different species to wastewater differed depending on their phytoremediation ability by nutrient uptake and biomass distribution. Tree species differed in their preferences to increased quantity of irrigation water and nutrients added through wastewater application.																			1522-6514	1549-7879				AUG 24	2022	24	10					1014	1024		10.1080/15226514.2021.1993784	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2021.1993784		OCT 2021						34694940					WOS:000710762700001

Therefore, a three-year field trial was conducted to compare two maize-soybean strip-intercropping planting patterns (two-rows of maize intercropped with two-rows of soybean [2M2S] or -three rows of soybean [2M3S]) were studied with sole maize (SM) and sole soybean (SS) systems. Our results showed that wider-strips of soybean grown as 2M3S had significantly higher leaf area index (LAI; 19%), total dry matter accumulation (TDM; 15%), and grain yield (21%) than the narrower 2M2S strips; this is likely related to the reduced effects of maize shading on soybean. Slightly decreased LAI (4%), TDM (8%), and grain yield (5%) of maize were found in 2M3S. On average, intercropped maize and soybean produced 80% and 52% in 2M2S and 76% and 63% in 2M3S compared to SM and SS yields, respectively, demonstrating the dominance of maize over soybean when intercropped. Similarly, maize was a stronger competitor for water than soybean, with partial water equivalent ratio of 0.81 in 2M2S and 0.78 in 2M3S, while that of soybean was 0.54 in 2M2S and 0.66 in 2M3S. In the intercropping systems, the land equivalent ratio ranged from 1.31 to 1.45, and the water equivalent ratio ranged from 1.32 to 1.49, exhibiting that maize-soybean strip-intercropping is a productive strategy to maximize water use efficiency. The results suggest that the maize-soybean strip-intercropping system may be a productive and sustainable strategy to improve the water use efficiency and land productivity under irrigated conditions. This strategy could benefit agriculture with cleaner, and more efficient production under a global scenario of constrained land and water resources. However, more studies are needed to evaluate the feasibility of intercropping systems in various growing conditions.

Farmland management regulates ecosystem services in Mediterranean drylands: Assessing the sustainability of agri-environmental payments for bird conservation	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												Agri-environment schemes directly focused on bird conservation have been implemented in agropastoral Mediterranean drylands aiming to guide the design of agricultural landscapes to enhance biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. In this study, by linking agricultural intensification indicators with the richness of grassland specialist birds (RGSB), we aimed to perform a preliminary assessment on the sustainability of the agrienvironmental measure "Maintenance of the cereal-fallow dryland rotation" evaluating for potential ecosystem service trade-offs resulting from the application of this measure in Southern Portugal. Our approach is novel by considering simultaneously three major drivers of farmland management ecology (grazing, cropping and haying) in an assessment performed at field level. During the 2012 to 2016 breeding seasons, bird and vegetation samplings were carried to obtain RGSB, and above-ground biomass and crude protein content, which were analysed using Linear Mixed Models (LMM) in relation to grazing, cultivation and haying intensity. Further, a cost-benefit analysis for farmers of the agrienvironmental measure was performed. Mixed models indicated a decrease on RGSB when increasing stocking rates and, in a lesser extent, cropping intensity or haying frequency. Vegetation biomass and RGSB (as an indicator of grassland management) were non-linearly associated indicating that the peak of biomass production does not correspond to the peak of bird richness. Crude protein content was negatively associated with RGSB. Cost-benefit analysis showed that agrienviroment payments can hardly return profit for farmers when contracted areas are higher than 250 ha. Farmers' profits can be maximized by increasing the contracted crop area. We conclude that the management of drylands to maintain these biodiversity-rich Iberian cultural landscapes can be adjusted to favour both bird conservation and farmers and therefore, cultural services linked to species richness such as the potential for ornithological tourism.

Establishment of a desert foundation species is limited by exotic plants and light but not herbivory or water	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions The biodiversity of deserts is becoming increasingly threatened due to global change including the introduction of invasive species. Desert shrubs are foundational species that can facilitate native plant communities but can also benefit exotic species. The influence of exotic plants on the establishment of benefactors from seeds or seedlings is a critical knowledge gap. We tested if the establishment, survival, or growth of seedlings for a benefactor shrub species in California was reduced by the invasive grasses that they facilitate in the field. Location San Joaquin Desert, California, USA. Methods We conducted a field survey to determine if a native shrub,Ephedra californica, facilitated the invasive grassBromus madritensis. Using seed collected from the field, we conducted a competition experiment onEphedra californica, using a densities series ofBromus madritensisand under manipulated conditions of light, water, and simulated herbivory. We measured seedling establishment, survival, and biomass ofEphedra californicaandBromus madritensis. Results In the field,Ephedra californicafacilitatedBromus madritensiswithin the shrub canopy. In the competition experiment,Bromus madritensishad consistent negative effects onEphedra californicaemergence and seedling survival at all resource and herbivory levels. The emergence and survival ofEphedra californicawas reduced in low light, but none of the manipulated conditions increased the competitive effect ofBromus madritensis. Conclusions Reciprocal costs of facilitation by shrubs were evident in emergence and seedling survival but not in growth once established. Water, herbivory, and shade did not mitigate these costs, but also did not exacerbate competition from exotics. Direct competition with exotic plant species is the most significant impact tested here on dryland shrub species and manipulations of resources or herbivory may not effectively promote shrub recruitment. Native shrubs are well adapted to variable desert conditions and could be effective foundational species if invasive grasses are reduced.

Consequently, the necessity of accurate LUCC mapping has become increasingly apparent. Over the past decades, although a large number of machine learning algorithms have been developed to improve the accuracy and reliability of remote sensing image classification, especially for LUCC classification, there is a lack of studies that assess the performance of machine learning algorithms in arid desert-oasis mosaic landscapes. In this study, the main objective is to provide a reference for the extraction of LUCC information in dryland regions with oasis-desert mosaic landscapes by comparing the performances of the k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) for the LUCC classification of the Dengkou Oasis, China. Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image data were used with spectral indices and auxiliary variables that were derived from a digital terrain model to classify 7 different land cover categories. The highest overall accuracy was produced by the ANN (97.16%), which was closely followed by the RF (96.92%), SVM (96.20%), and finally KNN (93.98%); statistically similar accuracies were obtained for the ANN, SVM and RF. The RF algorithm performed well across several aspects, such as stability, ease of use and processing time during the parameter tuning. Overall, the random forest algorithm is a good first choice method for land-cover classification in this study area, and the elevation and some spectral indices, such as the NDVI, MSAVI2 and MNDWI, should be used as variables to improve the overall accuracy.

Characterisation of the soil pore system in relation to its hydraulic functions in two South African aeolian soil groups	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PLANT AND SOIL												The characterisation of soil pores has a prime importance in soil hydrology particularly for soil water management in both irrigated and dryland agriculture. Hence, this study describes the soil pore system in the Clovelly and Hutton soil forms and its roles in soil hydrology by quantifying the different functional pore classes. The soil pore size-pore volume (PS-PV) response curve, which shows the relationship between cumulative pore volume to the corresponding pore sizes, was estimated from the soil water retention curve (SWRC) by applying the capillary theory. The SWRC was measured in the laboratory using a hanging water column and pressure plate apparatus. Saturated hydraulic conductivity was determined in situ with a constant head permeameter, whereas unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K-L) and diffusivity (D-f) were estimated from the SWRC by the van Genuchten conductivity model. The classification of soil pore sizes given in the literature was modified based on the concept of field water capacity. Therefore, pore sizes greater than the drained upper limit (DUL) were classified as transmission pores. Similarly, the pore size between the DUL and the lower limit (LL) were classified as storage pores, and pore sizes smaller than the LL were residuals and bonding pores collectively. Soil water retention increased non-linearly as pore sizes decreased and the opposite was true for K-L and D-f. Generally, macropores were important for water movement, whereas micropores were responsible for water retention. The findings are important for soil water management of cultivated aeolian soils in semi-arid and arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa. The proposed method to classify soil pores on the basis of their function also gives a consistent and realistic value compared with the fixed boundary classes, although the method requires further development.						van rensburg, leon/0000-0001-9936-0003; Mengistu, Achamyeleh/0000-0002-2860-5699													0257-1862	2167-034X				MAR 15	2019	36	2					107	116		10.1080/02571862.2018.1487594	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02571862.2018.1487594													WOS:000461494600005

Management of Iron and Manganese Toxicities of Lentil Crops Grown in Central Chile	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) toxicity is a widespread problem in lentil production in the coastal dryland of Chile. Increasing the soil pH by liming with CaCO3 or incrementing grain yields through nitrogen fertilization can help the plants to reduce metal concentration. Thus, the main objective of this work was to evaluate two different fertilization strategies (lime (CaCO3) and nitrogen (N) additions) to reduce Fe and Mn toxicities in lentils. Lentils grown under field conditions with the highest Fe and Mn concentrations showed toxicity symptoms, but without grain yield reductions. In a pot experiment using the same soil as in the field with toxicity symptoms, the dry matter (DM) produced at the end of the trial was higher in the plants that received N while the lowest DM production was recorded in those plants treated with lime. In particular, higher root DM sustained the growth of the N-fertilized shoots, which also positively affected the grain yields being 33% higher than the control treatment (no fertilization addition). In the plants fertilized with N, the Fe and Mn levels in the shoots were lower than the control plants and those grown in soils treated with lime, but showed higher concentrations of Fe and Mn in roots. In parallel, roots exhibited high concentrations of Fe and Mn that were 13- and 9-fold higher than in the shoots. Additionally, a significant decrease of 29% in Mn concentration in the grains of plants treated with N was reported. Overall, our results suggest that an increase in DM of lentils by the addition of N can reduce the Mn concentration on leaves to a level that is likely under the threshold that causes toxicity in plant tissues. Finally, we conclude that the increase of Fe and Mn in the roots may be connected to the reduction of these metals on leaves.

We study the onset of abrupt changes in Mediterranean holm oak (Quercus ilex) woodlands, by analyzing the combined effect of past human disturbance (mainly deforestation) and aridity on the functional state of these ecosystems. We determine ecosystem state in terms of herbaceous/woody species ratio, species richness and soil properties related to carbon and nitrogen cycling and microbial activity. The influence of both drivers was determined along spatial gradients of past human disturbance (from lightly to highly disturbed areas) and aridity (three levels: sub-humid, dry-transition, semi-arid). Our results show a strong interaction between aridity and past human disturbance on soil and vegetation properties. As disturbance increased, soil function decreased linearly in semi-arid and dry-transition conditions, but the trend was non-linear in sub-humid conditions. The latter showed a sharp decline at low-to-moderate disturbance intensity followed by a gentle recovery at higher intensities. These patterns were consistent for all soil properties. Structural changes in vegetation along the disturbance gradient, from open woodlands to shrublands in semi-arid and dry-transition conditions and from dense woodlands to grasslands in sub-humid conditions accompanied the linear vs non-linear patterns in soil function, respectively. Our results evidenced the existence of a critical climatic threshold in the boundary between sub-humid and dry-transition conditions, where the ecosystem switched from a fertile grassland to a highly degraded shrubland at moderate-to-high levels of disturbance (shrub encroachment), losing its capacity to buffer the effects of increasing disturbance. We propose a conceptual model illustrating the ecological mechanisms that may be underlying the onset of such abrupt shift.

Integrated pigweed (<i>Amaranthus</i> spp.) management in glufosinate-resistant soybean with a cover crop, narrow row widths, row-crop cultivation, and herbicide program	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Successful pigweed management requires an integrated strategy to delay the development of resistance to any single control tactic. Field trials were implemented during 2017 and 2018 in three counties in Kansas on dryland (limited rainfall, nonirrigated), glufosinate-resistant soybean. The objective was to assess pigweed control with combinations of a winter wheat cover crop (CC), three soybean row widths (76, 38, and 19 cm), row-crop cultivation 2.5 weeks after planting (WAP), and an herbicide program to develop integrated pigweed management recommendations. All combinations of the four components were assessed by 16 treatments. All treatments with the herbicide program resulted in excellent (>97%) pigweed control and were analyzed separately from the other components. Treatments containing row-crop cultivation reduced pigweed density and biomass 3 and 8 WAP in all locations compared with the 76-cm row width plus no CC treatment. CC impacts were mixed. In Riley County, Palmer amaranth density and biomass were reduced; in Reno County, no additional Palmer amaranth control was observed; in Franklin County, the CC had greater waterhemp density and biomass compared with the treatments containing no CC. Narrow row widths achieved the most consistent results of all cultural components when data were pooled across locations: Decreasing row widths from 76 to 38 cm resulted in a 23% reduction in pigweed biomass 8 WAP and decreasing row width from 38 to 19 cm achieved a 15% reduction. Row-crop cultivation should be incorporated where possible as a mechanical option to manage pigweed, and narrow row widths should be used to suppress late-season pigweed growth when feasible. Inconsistent pigweed control from CC was achieved and should be given special consideration before implementation. The integral use of these components with an herbicide program as a system should be recommended to achieve the best pigweed control and reduce the risk of developing herbicide resistance.																			0890-037X	1550-2740				OCT	2019	33	5					710	719		10.1017/wet.2019.62	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/wet.2019.62													WOS:000491469400009

Nevertheless, little is understood about their community assembly and the major factors regulating stochastic and deterministic pro-cesses, particularly with respect to the comparison of abundant and rare bacterial subcommunities in agricultural sys-tems. Here, we investigated the assembly of abundant and rare bacterial subcommunities in fields with different crops (maize and wheat) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer input at three different growth stages on the Loess Plateau. The high -throughput sequencing dataset was assessed using null and neutral community models. We found that abundant bac-teria was governed by the stochastic process of homogenizing dispersal, but rare bacterial subcommunity was predom-inant by deterministic processes in maize and wheat fields due to broader niche breadths of abundant species. Soil nitrogen (N) and P also determined the assembly of abundant and rare soil subcommunities. The relative abundance and composition of the abundant and rare bacterial subcommunities were also influenced by soil nutrients (soil avail-able P (AP) and NO3--N) and agricultural practices (P fertilization and crop cultivation). In addition, the abundant bac-terial community was more susceptible to P fertilizer input than that of the rare bacteria, and a higher relative abundance of abundant bacteria was observed in the P70 treatment both in maize and wheat soils. The microbial co-occurrence network analysis indicated that the maize field and low nutrient treatment exhibited stronger associa-tions and that the abundant bacteria showed fewer interconnections. This study provides new insights toward under-standing the mechanisms for the assembly of abundant and rare bacterial taxa in dryland cropping systems, enhancing our understanding of ecosystem diversity theory in microbial ecology.

The results show that: 1. The improvement of ecosystem and service is more obvious in the areas with a better ecological background in the East. The supply and regulation services of the ecosystem are synergetic. 2. In the past 2 decades, the ecological conditions of the Hexi corridor have improved as a whole, and the hot spots for improving ecosystem quality and services have gradually moved eastward. 3. Ecosystem changes have significantly changed the quantity and relationship of ecosystem services, showing strong spatial heterogeneity. For example, the loss of natural vegetation in the central and eastern regions with good ecological backgrounds has improved the water conservation service and also enhanced the synergy between it and the supply service. From the perspective of the relationship between ecosystem regulation services and supply services, the coordination characteristics are weakened, but the performance of regions with a poor ecological background in the west is just the opposite. In short, the typical climate characteristics of dry land with little rain and the spatial pattern of water resource shortage not only jointly determine the ecosystem background of the region, but also bring significant spatial differences and greater uncertainties to the relationship between ecosystem transformation and ecosystem services. Therefore, dryland ecosystem management and protection should be based on detailed and differentiated ecosystem assessment, taking into account regional natural resource endowment, giving priority to improving the stability of the regional ecosystem and gradually increasing regional ecosystem services.

Response of soil carbon dioxide efflux to temporal repackaging of rainfall into fewer, larger events in a semiarid grassland	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Changing rainfall patterns will alter soil water availability to plants and microbes and likely impact soil CO2 efflux (F-s) in semiarid ecosystems. However, our understanding of the response of F-s to compound changes in rainfall event size and frequency remains relatively limited. To address this knowledge gap, we examined how compound changes in rainfall size and frequency impact F-s in a semiarid grassland by deploying automated soil chambers at a rainfall manipulation experiment. All plots within the experiment received equal total summer growing season precipitation that was temporally repackaged into regular events of inversely varied size and frequency, with event sizes ranging from 5 to 50 mm and dry intervals ranging from 3.5 to 21 days. We found that repackaging rainfall into few/large events with long dry intervals decreased seasonal cumulative F-s. Repackaging influenced key aspects of pulses including mean, maximum, and antecedent (day before irrigation) values of soil moisture and F-s and their rate of decline during drying intervals. Soil moisture explained substantial variation in F-s (R-2 > 0.84) for all treatments; however, the sensitivity of F-s to soil moisture decreased in the few/large regime compared to the reference and many/small regimes. Dynamics in plant phenology (quantified by plot greenness) and soil temperature interacted with soil moisture to influence the seasonal evolution of F-s pulses and cumulative efflux. Our findings demonstrate that soil moisture and vegetation responses to changes in rainfall size and frequency impact soil CO2 efflux pulses and seasonal emissions in semiarid grasslands. These results, coupled with the knowledge that CO2 efflux pulses play an outsized role in dryland carbon exchange, indicate the possibility of future climate-mediated shifts in the carbon cycling of semiarid ecosystems.																				2296-665X				SEP 21	2022	10								940943	10.3389/fenvs.2022.940943	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.940943													WOS:000869725300001

Holman; Assefa, Yared			Single and multispecies dual-purpose cover crop productivity, nutritive value, and profitability	AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES & ENVIRONMENT												Replacing long fallow periods with dual-purpose forage cover crops increases productivity and profitability of dryland crop rotations. However, little information is available on specific forage cover crops mixtures that optimizes productivity, nutritive value, and profitability. The objective of this research was to quantify forage productivity, nutritive value, and profitability of spring-planted single or mixed species cover crops in a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]-fallow (WSF) crop rotation. This study was conducted from 2015 to 2017 at the Kansas State University Hearting Beason Ranch near Brownell, KS. The experimental design was a split-plot randomized complete block with four replications. The main plots were three crop phases of the WSF rotation (wheat-sorghum-fallow, sorghum-fallow-wheat, and fallow-wheat-sorghum), and subplots were five spring-planted cover crop treatments: (a) spring oat (Avena sativa L.), (b) spring triticale [xTriticosecale Wittm. ex A. Camus (Secale x Triticum)], (c) oat and triticale mixture (OT, two-species mixture), (d) oat, triticale, and pea (Pisum sativum L.) (OTP, three-species mixture), and (e) oat, triticale, pea, radish (Raphanus sativus L.), turnips (Brassica campestris L.), and buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) (six-species mixture). Results showed that cover crop forage accumulation was 33-35% greater in sole triticale and OT mixture compared with sole spring oat or cocktail treatments. Multispecies mixtures, cocktail and OTP cover crops, had significantly greater available energy, digestibility, and dry matter intake based on measured crude protein, acid and netural detergent fiber, and in vitro dry matter digestibility compared with single species (oat or triticale). Net return was US$100 ha(-1) greater for the OT treatment compared with the multispecies mixtures. We concluded that greater productivity and net return, along with adequate nutritive value, from sole triticale and OT mixture made them better dual-purpose forage cover crop alternatives.

However, temporary streamflow regimes, especially ephemeral flow, remain poorly quantified. We use electrical resistance sensors and USGS stream gauge data in 15 southern Arizona streams spanning a climate gradient (mean annual precipitation from 160 to 750 mm) to quantify temporary streamflow as streamflow presence and water presence, which includes streamflow, ponding and soil moisture. We use stream channel sediment data to estimate saturated hydraulic conductivity and potential annual infiltration. Annual streamflow ranged 0.6-82.4% or 2-301 days; while water presence ranged from 2.6 to 82.4% or 10 to over 301 days, or 4-33 times longer than streamflow. We identified 5 statistically distinct flow regimes based on the annual percent streamflow and water presence: (1) dry-ephemeral, (2) wet-ephemeral, (3) dry-intermittent, (4) wet-intermittent, and (5) seasonally-intermittent. In contrast to our expectations, stream channel density was a better predictor of annual streamflow and water presence than annual rainfall alone. Whereas, the dry-ephemeral and wet-ephemeral flow regimes varied with seasonal precipitation, the dry-intermittent, wet intermittent and seasonally-intermittent flow regimes did not. These results coupled with the potential infiltration estimates indicate that streamflow at the driest sites occurs in response to rainfall and overland flow while groundwater discharge and vadose zone contributions enhance streamflow at the wetter sites. We suggest that on a short temporal scale, and with respect to water presence, wetter sites might be buffered better against shifts in the timing and distribution of precipitation in response to climate change. Flow regime classifications that include both stream flow and water presence, rather than on stream flow alone, may be important for predicting thresholds in ecological functions and refugia in these dryland systems.																				2624-9375				NOV 27	2020	2								572950	10.3389/frwa.2020.572950	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2020.572950													WOS:000659473000001

Therefore, it is of great significance to investigate the influencing factors and mechanisms of SAP effects on soil environments and crop growth for the precise management of agricultural water-saving irrigation. In this study, we adopted SAP as a soil conditioner and monitored changes in soil temperature, photosynthetic rate, leaf transpiration rate, chlorophyll, crop growth indexes (plant height, stem diameter, leaf area index, dry matter accumulation), and yield under different SAP doses during the growth stage of maize, on the basis of which the improvement mechanism of SAP in arid and semi-arid soil was analyzed. The results demonstrated the following: (1) 45 kg/hm(2) of SAP application could increase the temperature of the soil layer, effectively reduce the diurnal temperature variation of the soil surface, and promote the stable growth of maize; (2) when different SAP doses were applied, the leaf surface temperature of maize increased by 0.95 degrees C on average. In particular, when 135 kg/hm(2) of SAP was applied, the leaf surface temperature increased by 1.55 degrees C; (3) SAP could promote the photosynthetic rate of maize. In addition, the plant height, leaf area index, and dry matter accumulation of maize gradually increased with an increasing amount of SAP; (4) the application of SAP not only increased the grain row number, ear row number, and average 100-seed weight, but also increased the crop yield by nearly 6%. The application of SAP demonstrated a comprehensive utility (redistribution of soil water and temperature, synergy between SAPs and plants), which suggests that the most basic goal, to ensure socio-economic and ecological sustainability in dryland systems, was obtained.

Current rehabilitation practices, at times, utilise inorganic soil amendments to improve the physicochemical and biological characteristics of reconstructed soil profiles. These approaches may be appropriate for dryland rehabilitation, but there is limited research available regarding the benefits of using these amendments. Here, we present a study in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, an arid landscape subject to intensive mining that currently uses inorganic soil amendments (gypsum and urea) in post-mining rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of these amendments to (1) promote seed germination, seedling emergence and seedling growth across five plant species and, (2) re-instate soil quality in mine waste substrates. A series of glasshouse experiments assessed eight application combinations of these amendments in two alternative substrates and compared these to unamended substrates and topsoil. Soil amendments had a limited influence on seed germination, were detrimental to seedling emergence and resulted in increased seedling mortality. Mortality in the waste ranged from 2 to 61% but increased to 7-92% in amended waste. Seedling growth improved with high doses of amendments in waste, with a 1.3-5.6-fold increase across all plant species. Soil quality was relatively unaffected by amendments with soil nitrogen ranging from 0.01 to 0.08%, organic carbon from 0.01 to 0.12% and soil microbial activity from 2.3 to 2.4 ppm-CO2 in the amended and unamended waste. The use of soil amendments in mine rehabilitation requires consideration of the trade-off between initial reductions in seedling recruitment and enhanced seedling development at later stages. Future rehabilitation should consider the timing of amendment application to avoid detrimental impacts on seedling recruitment and maximise the benefits to seedling growth.

In this study, a cross was made between two self-sterile isolates (Sg 019, Mat-2, G(2) x Sg 445-1, Mat-1, G(1)) of S. graminicola and a total of 39 F-1 progenies were established. The study on sexual compatibility types in F-1 progenies was conducted by crossing each F-1 progeny with both the parents (Sg 445-1, Mat-1, G(1); and Sg 019, Mat-2, G(2)). The results revealed the presence of four sexual compatibility types, viz. G(1), G(2), G(1)G(2) and G(0) (neuter) in the progenies. The G(1)G(2) progenies that produced oospores with both the parents were found as self-fertile (homothallic) and self-sterile (heterothallic) types. Similarly, self-fertile parental type G(1) and G(2) progenies were designated as secondary homothallic, whereas self-sterile parental type G(1) and G(2) progenies were of heterothallic type. The result of the present study revealed Mendelian segregation of mating type locus in S. graminicola which indicates that sexual reproduction plays an important role in the evolution of new genetic recombinants in the pathogen. The study also helps in understanding the genetic structure of S. graminicola populations and potential for possible evolution of new virulences in the pathogen.

However, the impact of microbial related metabolism on soil organic carbon (SOC) is not fully understood. Amino sugar analysis, high-throughput sequencing, and high-throughput qPCR approaches are combined to investigate this topic, based on a long-term experiment. Treatments include flat planting without mulching (FP), ridge-furrow without mulching (RF), and RFPM. RFPM significantly decreases rhizoplane SOC contents, while bulk SOC contents change insignifi-cantly across treatments. In terms of microbial metabolic pathways, RFPM decreases indicators of the in vivo metabolic pathway, whereas those of the ex vivo pathway are increased. In terms of microbial community features, core taxa module #1 is dominated by Sphingomonadaceae. These are putative high yield (Y) strategists, according to the microbial life-history strategy framework. They are closely related to the in vivo pathway and are most predictive for SOC; their abundance is highest under FP and lowest under RFPM. Core taxa module #2 is dominated by Chitinophagaceae, putative resource acquisition (A) strategists, that are closely related to the ex vivo pathway. Their abundance in the rhizoplane is highest under RFPM and lowest under FP. The RFPM-induced decline in SOC occurs simultaneously with the abundance of A-strategists with in vivo pathway but not the Y-strategists with ex vivo pathway. Overall, the result of this study shows a trade-off. In RFPM practice, the ex vivo microbial pathway is enhanced along with the abundance of A-strategists. This is not the case for the in vivo pathway and associated abundance of Y-strategists, which are closely associated with SOC. Our findings underlined the impact of rhizoplane microbial metabolic pathways on SOC status is key to agricultural practices in drylands such as RFPM, and advanced our under-standing of how microbes affect the carbon cycling in dryland farming.					yang, yun/IZE-1092-2023; Wang, Ziting/AEV-9358-2022; LIU, HAO/JBI-9623-2023; wang, qiang/IZW-1751-2023; Zhang, Yusi/JNS-2335-2023; zhang, shuai/IVU-7877-2023; Lu, Jianhong/IYT-3322-2023; Wang, lili/IXD-9828-2023; Hou, Yuting/HPG-7699-2023														0048-9697	1879-1026				APR 10	2023	868								161713	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161713	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161713		JAN 2023						36682553					WOS:000924529600001

To restore these degraded ecosystems, governments have implemented projects that often include revegetation, but we still lack an understanding of how soil food webs and ecosystem functions are affected by revegetation. By conducting a large-scale revegetation experiment under two degradation intensities (low and high) on the Inner Mongolian degraded grassland, we tested the effects of revegetation on primary producers (plants), key components of soil food webs (bacteria, fungi and nematodes) and ecosystem functions (soil C and N mineralization). After 4 years, revegetation greatly increased the biomass of plants and soil bacteria and fungi but had less effects on soil nematode functional groups. Revegetation increased vegetation and bacterial diversity and soil C and N mineralization rates, altered the structures of vegetation and soil microbial communities, but did not affect soil fungal or nematode diversity. The stronger effects of revegetation on plants, soil bacteria, soil fungi and soil nematodes in plots with low degradation intensity than in plots with high degradation intensity indicated that future revegetation efforts should consider the degree of degradation. Revegetation also increased the interactions among plants, soil food webs and ecosystem functions, indicating that the revegetation-induced changes in soil food webs could facilitate the recovery of soil nutrients and vegetation productivity in degraded grasslands. Synthesis and applications. The effects of revegetation were stronger on plants (primary producers) and soil micro-organisms (intermediate trophic levels) than on soil nematodes (higher trophic levels), and even short-term revegetation increased the complexity of soil food webs and strengthened their relationships with soil functions in degraded grasslands. These results highlight the effects of restoration on multiple trophic levels in degraded drylands, and suggest that some aspects of plant-soil interactions in global drylands could be rapidly improved by appropriate restoration.					wang, jing/GVT-8700-2022; Liu, Shengen/K-1553-2019; Chen, Dima/H-4060-2013; Liu, Shengen/AFB-6585-2022	Liu, Shengen/0000-0002-4730-5202; Chen, Dima/0000-0002-1687-0401; Wang, Bing/0000-0002-7308-1759													0021-8901	1365-2664				JUL	2022	59	7					1721	1733		10.1111/1365-2664.14180	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.14180		APR 2022											WOS:000789533200001

To study the characteristics and occurrence and development of drought events in Northern Shaanxi is beneficial to the prevention and control of drought disasters. Based on the monthly rainfall data of 10 meteorological stations in Northern Shaanxi from 1960 to 2019, the characteristic variables of drought events at each meteorological station in Northern Shaanxi were extracted by using run theory and copula function. The joint probability distribution and recurrence period were obtained by combining the duration and intensity of drought, and the relationship between drought characteristics and crop drought affected area was studied. The results show that (1) from 1960 to 2019, drought events mainly occurred in Northern Shaanxi with long duration and low severity, short duration and high severity, or short duration and low severity, among which the frequency of drought events that occurred in Yuyang and Baota districts was higher. The frequency of light drought and extreme drought was more in the south and less in the north, while the frequency of moderate drought and severe drought was more in the north and less in the south. (2) The optimal edge distribution of drought intensity and drought duration in Northern Shaanxi is generalized Pareto distribution, and the optimal fitting function is Frank copula function. The greater the duration and intensity of drought, the greater the cumulative probability and return period. (3) The actual recurrence interval and the theoretical recurrence interval of drought events in Northern Shaanxi were close, and the error was only 0.1-0.3a. The results of the joint return period can accurately reflect the actual situation, and this study can provide effective guidance for the prevention and management of agricultural dryland in Northern Shaanxi.

The results of this study show the practical interest of spectrometry and of remote sensing as expeditious tools for monitoring pasture quality and support farm management decisions in terms of animal supplementation needs in the critical periods. Pasture quality monitoring is a key element in the decision making process of a farm manager. Laboratory reference methods for assessing quality parameters such as crude protein (CP) or fibers (neutral detergent fiber: NDF) require collection and analytical procedures involving technicians, time, and reagents, making them laborious and expensive. The objective of this work was to evaluate two technological and expeditious approaches for estimating and monitoring the evolution of the quality parameters in biodiverse Mediterranean pastures: (i) near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined with multivariate data analysis and (ii) remote sensing (RS) based on Sentinel-2 imagery to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference water index (NDWI). Between February 2018 and March 2019, 21 sampling processes were carried out in nine fields, totaling 398 pasture samples, of which 315 were used during the calibration phase and 83 were used during the validation phase of the NIRS approach. The average reference values of pasture moisture content (PMC), CP, and NDF, obtained in 24 tests carried out between January and May 2019 in eight fields, were used to evaluate the RS accuracy. The results of this study showed significant correlation between NIRS calibration models or spectral indices obtained by remote sensing (NDVI(RS)and NDWIRS) and reference methods for quantifying pasture quality parameters, both of which open up good prospects for technological-based service providers to develop applications that enable the dynamic management of animal grazing.

To reduce this pollution risk, the following four research questions needed to be addressed: What are the main influencing factors of soil pollution? What is the degree of influence? Do factors operate independently or are they interconnected? Which regions have high pollution risk and should be paid more attention? The study area was in Huanjiang County, with 273 km(2), and geographical detector proved to be a useful tool to solve these four problems. We found that mine activity and pH value were the primary influencing factors for total and water-soluble heavy metals. The interaction effects of mine activity and soil type, pH values, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for total heavy metals, as well as pH value and mine activity for water-soluble heavy metals, were greater than the sum effect of two factors. Zones with a high concentration of heavy metals were closer to the road and farther from the mine area, which had low NDVI, large slope, high terrain, and large pH values. Concentrations of total heavy metals were higher in calcareous soils and in dryland and forests. Zones with a higher concentration of water-soluble heavy metals were closer to the mine and river, which had lower DEM and pH values The uncertainty of geographical detector was also analyzed on the basis of their interpolation accuracy and the stratification number of influencing factors, and we found that the existing sample numbers and the stratification number of influencing factors met the needs of geographical detector calculation. This study's conclusions are useful for soil pollution control and restoration. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here we report three platinum grade de-novo, near gap-free, chromosome-level reference genome assemblies from the active breeding germplasm in pearl millet with a high degree of contiguity, completeness, and accuracy. An improved Tift genome (Tift23D(2)B(1)-P1-P5) assembly has a contig N50 similar to 7,000-fold (126 Mb) compared to the previous version and better alignment in centromeric regions. Comparative genome analyses of these three lines clearly demonstrate a high level of collinearity and multiple structural variations, including inversions greater than 1 Mb. Differential genes in improved Tift genome are enriched for serine O-acetyltransferase and glycerol-3-phosphate metabolic process which play an important role in improving the nutritional quality of seed protein and disease resistance in plants, respectively. Multiple marker-trait associations are identified for a range of agronomic traits, including grain yield through genome-wide association study. Improved genome assemblies and marker resources developed in this study provide a comprehensive framework/platform for future applications such as marker-assisted selection of mono/oligogenic traits as well as whole-genome prediction and haplotype-based breeding of complex traits.

In the present study, we investigated the transport of glyphosate and its main metabolite, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) via earthworms in the presence of different concentrations of light density polyethylene microplastics in the litter layer during a 14-day mesocosm experiment. The results showed earthworm gallery weight was negatively affected by the combination of glyphosate and microplastics. Glyphosate and AMPA concentrated in the first centimetre of the top soil layer and the downward transport of glyphosate and AMPA was only detected in the earthworm burrows, ranging from 0.04 to 4.25 mu g g(-1) for glyphosate and from 0.01 (less than limit of detection) to 0.76 mu g g(-1) for AMPA. The transport rate of glyphosate (including AMPA) from the litter layer into earthworm burrows ranged from 6.6 +/- 4.6% to 183 +/- 2.4%, depending on synergetic effects of microplastics and glyphosate application. The findings imply that earthworm activities strongly influence pollutant movement into the soil, which potentially affects soil ecosystems. Further studies focused on the fate of pollutants in the microenvironment of earthworm burrows are needed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Lakshmi Aruna			Long Term Effects of Conjunctive Nutrient Management Practices on Soil Quality in Maize (<i>Zea</i> m<i>ays</i>) -Mustard (<i>Brassica compestris</i> var. <i>sarson</i>) Rotation under Rainfed Hill Inceptisol Soils	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS												The decline in the yields of most of the crops grown in the hill Inceptisol soils of Jammu region of India , is largely attributed to the gradual decrease in soil quality, owing to the poor soil-nutrient management practices. The indicators and the overall indices of the soil quality can be improved to a greater extent through the conjunctive use of organic and inorganic sources of nutrients, instead solely depending upon the inorganic sources. Therefore, a long-term study was conducted with the prime objective to assess the long-term effect of different conjunctive nutrient management practices on soil quality indicators and indices in hill Inceptisol soils of Jammu region of India. The results of the study revealed that after 11 years the order of superiority of the treatments in terms of maize grain yield was 100% NPK (60:40:20 kg ha(-1)) (T2) (2186 kg ha(-1)) > 50% NPK + 50% N (FYM) (1961 kg ha(-1)) (T7) > 50% NPK + 50% N (crop residue) (1789 kg ha(-1)) (T6) > 50% N (FYM) (1510 kg ha(-1)) (T5) > 50% NPK (1436 kg ha(-1)) (T3) > 50% N (crop residue) (1426 kg ha(-1)) (T4) > control (1183 kg ha(-1)) (T1). In case of mustard crop, the order of superiority was T7 (1157 kg ha(-1)) > T5 (960 kg ha(-1)) > T6 (903 kg ha(-1)) > T2 (874 kg ha(-1)) > T3 (783 kg ha(-1) > T4 (710 kg ha(-1)) > T1 (541 kg ha(-1)). The percent contribution of key indicators toward soil quality index was in the order of available sulfur (S) (31.9%) > microbial biomass carbon (MBC) (31.8) > dehydrogenase assay (DHA) (8.36%) > pH (8.05%) > electrical conductivity (EC) (6.01%) > organic carbon (OC) (4.87%) > available zinc (Zn) (4.56%) > available phosphorus (P) (4.45%). The relative order of performance of treatments in terms of soil quality indices was T5 (1.52) >= T7 (1.52) > T6 (1.46) > T2 (1.38) > T3 (1.33) > T4 (1.25) > T1 (control) (0.97). Our study has clearly indicated that after 11 years, the conjunctive use of organic sources of N such as FYM and crop residues in combination with inorganic sources (@ 50:50 on the basis of N equivalents) proved very effective in improving the soil quality indicators and indices under maize (Zea mays) - mustard (Brassica campestris var. Sarson) crop rotation in rainfed hill Inceptisol soils.																			0010-3624	1532-2416				FEB 21	2022	53	4					439	452		10.1080/00103624.2021.2017448	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2021.2017448		DEC 2021											WOS:000735810100001
J	Schillinger, WF; Wuest, SB				Schillinger, William F.; Wuest, Stewart B.			Wheat stubble height effects on soil water capture and retention during long fallow	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												A 4-yr study was conducted in a dry Mediterranean region of the Inland Pacific Northwest USA (PNW) to measure winter wheat (WW) (Triticum aestivum L.) stubble height and orientation effects on overwinter precipitation capture in the soil and subsequent water retention during ensuing dry summer months. The stubble was left standing and undisturbed during the 13-mo fallow periods. Stubble-height treatments were:(i) short (8 cm), (ii) medium (25 cm), and (iii) tall (75 cm). An additional treatment: (iv) mow tall stubble in mid-June, was included in the final two years. Soil water measurements were obtained at the beginning, middle, and end of fallow in 15-cm increments to a depth of 180 cm. Additionally, seed-zone water content was measured at the end of fallow in 2-cm increments to a depth of 26 cm. Near-surface soil temperature was measured from June-August. On average, tall- and medium-height stubble captured 34 and 32 mm (p = 0.002) more overwinter precipitation, respectively, than short stubble and these values were particularly pronounced (91 and 79 mm greater than short stubble) during a winter of heavy snow drifting. However, from mid-April until late August, the tall stubble lost an average of 91 mm of soil water compared to 70 and 59 mm in the medium and short stubble treatments (p 0.001). Mowing tall stubble in mid-June before the hot, dry summer did not improved water retention. Continuous soil temperatures at 3, 7, 15, 25, and 40-cm depths measured electronically from June-August were coolest with the short, mowed, medium, and tall stubble, respectively, with frequent significant differences of 1 degrees C among treatments. We speculate that soil in the tall treatment was warmest and lost the most over-summer water because all stubble was standing and offered less soil shading than the other treatments. At the end of fallow, medium and tall stubble averaged 14 and 8 mm greater soil water, respectively, than the short treatment (p = 0.027). Short stubble was a disadvantage for overwinter precipitation capture but was equal or better than the other treatments for retaining soil water from April to late August; presumably because this treatment had the most residue lying flat on the soil surface for shading. These findings offer opportunity to improve current models for soil water dynamics during fallow by incorporating stubble height. For combined soil water retention and farm management factors, medium-height WW stubble is the best fallow option for farmers in the PNW drylands.

However, little is known regarding the degree of soil water depletion and its effects on orchard productivity in rainfed apple orchards. We used a combination of field sampling and modeling to understand the impact of apple orchards on soil water availability and changes in orchard productivity over a long-term time series. A total of 51 soil profiles from eight experimental sites in the Loess Plateau, were collected in 2010 and 2016 and modeling was used to evaluate the long-term effects of apple plantations on soil water depletion and orchard productivity. A process-based model, the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC), was calibrated and validated using survey data from field experiments. The calibrated EPIC model could well simulate soil moisture and orchard productivity with relative root mean square errors (RRMSE) of 11.12 % and 2.71 %, respectively. Field sampling and modeling showed that conversion from farmlands to orchards decreased soil moisture, leading to severe soil water depletion (SWD) in the 0-15.0 m soil profiles. Stand age was the main factor influencing soil moisture, and SWD gradually increased with increasing stand age. Depleted soil water led to land degradation and decreased orchard productivity, especially in water-limited regions. Simulation results suggested that the optimal planting density and fertilizer application rates were often related to variability in climatic conditions; therefore, appropriate management practices need to be adapted to local natural conditions. Although SWD in apple or-chards is inevitable, the detrimental effects could be minimized during orchard development, provided that appropriate management measures are selected based on precipitation and soil water conditions. These findings may provide a basis for evaluating the extent of SWD and its effect on orchard productivity in dryland apple orchards.					wang, yu/IUQ-6654-2023; Liu, Yujie/IWU-6535-2023; yuan, liping/JPK-7584-2023; LI, XIAO/JCE-6169-2023; yang, zhuo/JPK-3133-2023; Peng, Xingxing/AGY-1355-2022; zhang, chen/JES-0371-2023; wang, xiaoyu/HJP-6901-2023; liu, jiaming/IWE-3196-2023; liu, junyang/IXD-1252-2023; Wang, lili/IXD-9828-2023; wang, wei/JBS-7400-2023; liu, junyang/IXD-1201-2023; lu, yang/IWE-3635-2023	Liu, Yujie/0000-0002-1153-6156; 													0378-3774	1873-2283				NOV 1	2022	273								107883	10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107883	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107883		AUG 2022											WOS:000856028700005

When priorities are placed on ecological integrity, remotely sensed estimates of fractional vegetation components (FVCs) are useful for measuring landscape-level habitat structure and function. In this study, we address whether FVC estimates, stratified by dominant vegetation type, vary with different classification approaches applied to very-high-resolution small unoccupied aerial system (UAS)-derived imagery. Using Parrot Sequoia imagery, flown on a DJI Mavic Pro micro-quadcopter, we compare pixel- and segment-based random forest classifiers alongside a vegetation height-threshold model for characterizing the FVC in a southern African dryland savanna. Results show differences in agreement between each classification method, with the most disagreement in shrub-dominated sites. When compared to vegetation classes chosen by visual identification, the pixel-based random forest classifier had the highest overall agreement and was the only classifier not to differ significantly from the hand-delineated FVC estimation. However, when separating out woody biomass components of tree and shrub, the vegetation height-threshold performed better than both random-forest approaches. These findings underscore the utility and challenges represented by very-high-resolution multispectral UAS-derived data (~10 cm ground resolution) and their uses to estimate FVC. Semi-automated approaches statistically differ from by-hand estimation in most cases; however, we present insights for approaches that are applicable across varying vegetation types and structural conditions. Importantly, characterization of savanna land function cannot rely only on a "greenness" measure but also requires a structural vegetation component. Underscoring these insights is that the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation structure on the landscape broadly informs land management, from land allocation, wildlife habitat use, natural resource collection, and as an indicator of overall ecosystem function.

However, few studies have uncoupled the effects of drought severity from the degree to which the soil is saturated. In this study, we conducted three aerobic incubation experiments to investigate the effects of soil rewetting on N2O emissions from a dryland soil. The results showed that, at constant soil moisture, total N2O emissions in soil with 90% water-holding capacity (WHC) were significantly higher than those in 30%, 45%, 60% and 75% WHC treatments. In the dry-wet group, the soil moisture content was adjusted from 30%, 45% and 60% WHC to the end content of 75% and 90% WHC, respectively; the cumulative N2O emissions in the 30-90%, 45-90% and 60-90% WHC nitrogen (N) treatments were significantly higher than those in the 30-75%, 45-75% and 60-75% WHC N treatments. Regarding fertilizer N types, there was no significant difference in N2O emissions from soil at 90% WHC when (NH4)(2)SO4 or urea was applied. Nitrification inhibitor significantly reduced N2O emissions in soil applied with NH4+-N fertilizer, indicating that nitrification played a major role in N2O emissions from soils. The contribution of denitrification was negligible, according to the low emission rate of soils with only NO3- additions. High N2O emissions occurred in soil treated with NO2, accounting for about 83.6% of those of the NH4+ treatment. Therefore, in this study we concluded that the end water content of soil was more important than the role of drought severity in the dry-wet process and that nitrifier denitrification was probably the main pathway of N2O production under the condition of 90% WHC moisture after rewetting soil.

Nematode populations as affected by residue and water management in a long-term wheat-soybean double-crop system in eastern Arkansas	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												Soybeans (Glycine max L.) are one of the major row crops in the United States, particularly in Arkansas. The soybean cyst nematode (SCN, Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) is one of the most damaging pests that can cause major economic losses in soybeans. Little is known concerning the combined effects of tillage [conventional tillage (CT) and no tillage (NT)], water management (irrigation and non-irrigation), residue burning (burn and no burn), and wheat residue level (high and low) on nematodes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the combination of agronomic practices (tillage, water management, burning, and residue level) on natural nematode population densities and change over the growing season in a long-term wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-soybean rotation on a silt-loam soil in Arkansas. A suite of 10 nematode genera were measured in the top 10 cm in July, August, and October in 2017 and 2018. Averaged across all other treatment factors, SCN egg concentration was 17.9 times greater at the end of the growing season in October than in July and August. The SCN second-stage juvenile (J2) population densities were 3.4 times greater in the CT-burn than in the CT-noburn and NT-burn treatment combinations. In contrast to under CT, SCN J2 population densities were 3.8 times greater in the NT-no-burn than under the NT-burn treatment combinations. Lance, lesion, spiral, and stunt nematode population densities were also affected by various field treatment combinations. Traditional (i.e., tillage, residue burning, and irrigation) and alternative (i.e., non-tillage, no burning, and dryland) wheat-soybean management practices can influence nematode population densities even in non-problematic fields, thus potentially affecting long-term strategies to maximize soybean profitability.

J	de Oliveira, ACP; Nunes, A; Rodrigues, RG; Branquinho, C				Pereira de Oliveira, Ana Claudia; Nunes, Alice; Rodrigues, Renato Garcia; Branquinho, Cristina			The response of plant functional traits to aridity in a tropical dry forest	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Drylands are experiencing an overall increase in aridity that is predicted to intensify in the future due to climate change. This may cause changes in the structure and functioning of dryland ecosystems, affecting ecosystem services and human well-being. Therefore, detecting early signs of ecosystem change before irreversible damage takes place is important. Thus, here we used a space-for-time substitution approach to study the response of the plant community to aridity in a Tropical dry forest (Caatinga, Brazil), and infer potential consequences of climate change. We assessed plant functional structure using the community weighted mean (CWM) and functional diversity, measured through functional dispersion (FDis), along a 700 km climatic gradient. We studied 13 functional traits, reflecting strategies associated with establishment, defense, regeneration, and dispersal of the most abundant 48 plant species in 113 sampling sites. Spearman correlations were used to test the relation between aridity and single-trait functional metrics. Aridity was a major environmental filter of the plant community functional structure. We found a higher abundance of species with deciduous leaves, zoochorous dispersal, fleshy fruits, chemical defense exudation and spinescence, and crassulacean acid metabolism towards more arid sites, at the expense of species with evergreen and thicker leaves, autochory dispersal, and shrub growth-form. The FDis of leaf type and thickness decreased with aridity, whereas FDis of fruit type, photosynthetic pathway, and defense strategies increased.

Based on this review, it is argued that recent theoretical advances in the global production network (GPN) approach can help to achieve a more holistic view of agricultural development policies than the more linear value chain research. In particular, three key concepts from the GPN approach are highlighted: mobilisation of regional assets, strategic coupling and territorial embeddedness. These key concepts are used to propose a framework called 'insight-out strategic coupling for smallholder integration', which builds on the concept of strategic coupling in GPN research and applies it as a development tool to agricultural production. Using an in-depth case study approach, the usefulness of this framework is tested by examining the experience of Malawi Mangoes, a company established to promote smallholder exports. Malawi Mangoes was initially funded by private equity, but despite a number of challenges along the way, was soon able to attract development funding and integrate smallholders from surrounding villages throughout-grower schemes. Analysis of the case shows both the usefulness of the framework and the lost potential in implementing agricultural development policy. The authors conclude that the framework is useful for linking current debates on agricultural development interventions, but that the findings of critical GPN research need to be taken into account when developing agricultural development interventions in order to respect the 'do no harm' principle.

Phosphorus sorption characteristics and interactions with leaf litter-derived dissolved organic matter leachate in iron-rich sediments of a sub-tropical ephemeral stream	AQUATIC SCIENCES												This study investigated the influence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) additions on phosphate sorption kinetics of iron-rich sediments (39-50% hematite and goethite) from an ephemeral stream in the arid Pilbara region of sub-tropical northwest Australia. While phosphate sorption in stream sediments is known to be strongly influenced by sediment mineralogy as well as interactions with DOM, the mechanisms and significance of DOM on P-release from sediments with high sorption capacities, are largely undescribed. We assessed phosphorus (P) sorption behaviours by adding a range of solutions of known inorganic P concentrations that were amended with variable loadings of DOM derived from leachates of leaf litter to sediments from stream pools during the non-flowing phase. We compared the sorption capacity of the sediments and concurrent changes in DOM composition measured using fluorescence spectroscopy. We show that the low-dose DOM addition (similar to 4 mg L-1 DOC) had the effect of reducing sediment P adsorption capacity, while for the high-dose DOM addition (similar to 45 mg L-1 DOC), it was increased. The high-dose DOM was similar to pore water DOC and likely saturated sediment surface adsorption sites and produced P-OM-Fe complexes. This resulted in increased removal of P from solution. Sediment P sorption characteristics were well fitted to both Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models regardless of DOC concentration. Langmuir P sorption maxima ranged from 0.106 to 0.152 mg g(-1). General P sorption characteristics of these iron-rich sediments did not differ among pools of contrasting hydrological connectivity. Our results show how humic-rich DOM can modulate the sediment P availability in dryland streams. Unravelling the complexities of P availability is of particular significance to further our understanding of biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems where P often acts as a limiting nutrient.

Priming effect in semi-arid soils of northern Ethiopia under different land use types	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Input of organic carbon (C) to the soil stimulates soil microbial activity leading to changes in turnover of soil organic matter, a phenomenon referred to as priming effect (PE). However, contribution of various management forms in tropical drylands, the role of land use conversion and the soil depth at which such management induces altered PEs remain largely unclear. In this study, we quantified respiration and PE in semi-arid soils of northern Ethiopia. Soils from three depths (0-30, 30-60 and 60-90 cm) in forest, croplands, exclosure and grazing land use types were sampled. The soil samples were incubated for 23 days and PE and respiration quantified after addition of C-14 labeled glucose corresponding to 50% of initial microbial biomass carbon (MBC). Generally, CO2 respired was 30-63% lower in sub than in topsoil with most expressed depth gradients in croplands. The weak negative PEs in subsoil is an indication of highly stabilized C. Contrary, glucose addition induced stronger positive PEs in topsoils collected from forest, exclosure and grazing land. The temporal dynamics of PEs involved a strong positive peak for the first five days after glucose addition and a second smaller peak 10 days after glucose addition in natural ecosystem, corresponding to apparent and real PE, respectively. Lack of positive correlation between PEs and C/N ratio ruled out the N-mining hypothesis, but a positive correlation between PE and MBC suggests co-metabolism as possible mechanism behind the real PE. Higher priming in natural ecosystem compared to cropland is an indication that conversion of natural ecosystem to continuous cropping system leads to depletion of the "primable" C pool in dryland soils. Additionally, this land use conversion negatively affects biogeochemical C cycling by an altered response of soil microbes to C input.

Water vapor adsorption by dry soils: A potential link between the water and carbon cycles	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Water vapor adsorption (WVA) by soil is a potential contributor to the water cycle in drylands. However, continuous in-situ estimates of WVA are still scarce and the understanding of its coupling with carbon cycle and ecosystem processes remains at an incipient stage. Here we aimed to (1) identify periods of WVA and improve the understanding of the underlying processes involved in its temporal patterns by using the gradient method; (2) characterize a potential coupling between water vapor and CO2 fluxes, and (3) explore the effect of soil properties and biocrusts ecological succession on fluxes. We assumed that the nocturnal soil CO2 uptake increasingly reported in those environments could come from WVA enhancing geochemical reactions involving calcite. We measured continuously during ca. 2 years the relative humidity and CO2 molar fraction in soil and atmosphere, in association with below- and aboveground variables, over the biocrusts ecological succession. We estimated water vapor and CO2 fluxes with the gradient method, and cumulative fluxes over the study. Then, we used statistical modelling to explore relationships between variables. Our main findings are (1) WVA fluxes during hot and dry periods, and new insights on their underlying mechanisms; (2) a diel coupling between water vapor and CO2 fluxes and between cumulative fluxes, well predicted by our models; and (3) cumulative CO2 influxes increasing with specific surface area in early succession stages, thus mitigating CO2 emissions. During summer drought, as WVA was the main water source, it probably maintained ecosystem processes such as microbial activity and mineral reactions in this dryland. We suggest that WVA could drive the nocturnal CO2 uptake in those moments and discuss biogeochemical mechanisms potentially involved. Additional research is needed to monitor soil water vapor and CO2 uptake and separate their biotic and abiotic components as those sinks could grow with climate change.

Developing an environmental research platform in the Karoo at the Square Kilometre Array	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												A part of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will be constructed in the northern Karoo of South Africa on approximately 135 000 ha of land. This land is formerly privately owned rangelands (farms) that were Astronomy Observatory, as part of the global SKA project, will erect the SKA infrastructure. Additionally, a long-term environmental research programme will be established to investigate various dryland ecosystem components at a landscape scale. Livestock has been removed from the farms, and the area is now land cover changes present an unprecedented opportunity to study ecosystem dynamics. The property will be established as an NRF science park, incorporating an SKA research platform for radio astronomy and an environmental research platform of the South African Environmental Observation Network, with additional environmental research conducted by SANParks and their collaborators. We briefly describe current knowledge of the area's environment, and report on past and contemporary changes in this part of the Karoo. We present a conceptual model for the larger landscape which considers possible future land-use scenarios, the projected trajectories of change under these scenarios, and factors influencing these trajectories. These deliberations represent the foundation for future research in this landscape and the development of an environmental observation research platform in the Karoo at SKA. center dot We summarise an extensive environmental baseline report on the SKA property and surrounding areas. center dot Withdrawal of livestock and other changes - such as clearing of alien invasive plants, reduced predator control and reduction in water-point maintenance - are expected to bring about changes in ecological processes and plant and animal communities. center dot We present a conceptual model of scenarios to test possible future trajectories as a first step towards an earth system science research platform in the NRF science park.						van der Merwe, Helga/0000-0002-7677-5123; Milton, Suzanne Jane/0000-0003-4390-6040; Henschel, Joh/0000-0001-7122-2768; Dean, W.R.J./0000-0002-6541-3565													0038-2353	1996-7489				NOV-DEC	2021	117	11-12							10511	10.17159/sajs.2021/10511	http://dx.doi.org/10.17159/sajs.2021/10511													WOS:000739008100005

Fish and flows: Abiotic drivers influence the recruitment response of a freshwater fish community throughout a regulated lotic system of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												Fish assemblages in dryland rivers have life-history strategies that have evolved in response to environmental conditions and triggers, particularly water temperatures and flow regimes. The regulation of rivers through the construction of dams, weirs and other water diversion structures has altered natural flow regimes and the associated ecological processes of river systems worldwide. Over a 3-year period, using standardized fish sampling and daily otolith ageing, the recruitment of eight freshwater fish species was monitored in response to various abiotic drivers, including hydrology and water temperatures, throughout the Macquarie River, a large regulated river system of the Australian Murray-Darling Basin. A data-driven statistical classification system is provided that groups species into reproductive guilds, based on their recruitment response to hydrology and water temperature, specifically designed for use in environmental flow management. The eight species were grouped into three distinct reproductive guilds that showed similar recruitment responses to the abiotic drivers. Murray-Darling rainbowfish, Murray cod, and eel-tailed catfish were considered as a single guild, characterized by seasonal recruitment during a relatively narrow thermal window under low to moderate stable discharges. The second group included common carp, bony herring, and golden perch, which recruited primarily in association with larger flow events. Un-specked hardyhead and Australian smelt formed a more differentiated guild, recruiting over a broad range of temperatures and discharges. Limitations associated with using a reproductive guild approach to simplify water management are discussed. This study highlighted important relationships among hydrology, water temperatures, and successful recruitment that can, in turn, be used to inform development of adaptive flow management plans and effective use of environmental water for the conservation management of native fish communities. Important considerations in the design of studies that aim to examine relationships between recruitment and abiotic drivers are also discussed.

Estimation of grain protein content in commercial bread and durum wheat fields via traits inverted by radiative transfer modelling from Sentinel-2 timeseries	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Wheat (Triticum spp.) is crucial to food security. Grain protein content (GPC) is key to its nutritional and economic value and is controlled by genetic and agronomic factors, soil properties and weather. GPC prediction from remote sensing could reduce nitrogen (N) losses, help management decisions, and improve profit. However, GPC prediction is complex because multiple plant traits influence GPC and their effects change through the growing season. Traits with known physiological links to GPC, which can be retrieved from imaging spectroscopy, include leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll (Ca+b), and stress indicators. Further inspection of these and other traits retrieved from satellite data can advance research relevant to precision agriculture. Sentinel-2 (S2) timeseries (TS) were acquired for 6,355 ha of commercial dryland bread (T. aestivum) and durum (T. durum) wheat fields in south-east Australia through two consecutive years with dissimilar rainfall. Wheat growers provided similar to 92,000 GPC data points from harvester-mounted protein monitors. For each, Ca+b, leaf dry matter, leaf water content (C-w) and LAI were retrieved from the S2 images by radiative transfer model inversion. A gradient boosted machine learning algorithm was applied to analyse these traits' importance to GPC and to predict GPC in 30% of samples unseen by the algorithm in training. The strongest relationships between predicted and observed GPC (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.56 %), in a model built from five S2 images across a season, were better than those from single-date hyperspectral (HS). In severe water stress, LAI was the main predictor of GPC early in the season, but this switched to C-w later. Trait importance was more evenly distributed in milder conditions. S2 TS had a clear accuracy advantage over single-date S2 and HS, especially in benign conditions, emphasising the potential of S2 TS for large-scale GPC monitoring.

The objective of this study was to explore whether the effects of land use on SOC stock differed with soil type and, particularly, with soil hydraulic properties. For this purpose, 90 sites from the Canterbury Plains, New Zealand, were sampled to a depth of 30 cm. The sampled sites consisted of long-term (>20 years) dryland pasture [DP], irrigated pasture [IP], and irrigated cropping [IC] covering three contrasting soil types with different soil drainage levels, including well drained Lismore (LIS) soil, imperfectly drained Templeton (TEM) soil, and poorly drained Waterton/Temuka (WAT) soil. On average, compared with DP, IP increased SOC and hot water extractable carbon (HWEC) stock at all depths; IC decreased SOC and HWEC at 0-15 cm. The results highlighted that the effects of land use change from DP to IP and IC on total SOC and HWEC stock significantly differed between soil types. The greatest gains in SOC and HWEC stocks following change from DP to IP were found in LIS soil; the greatest losses in SOC and HWEC stocks following change from DP to IC were found in WAT soil; and no significant differences in SOC stocks with land use changes were found in TEM soil. The results implied that the interaction between land use and soil type on SOC and HWEC stocks was associated with soil hydraulic properties (e.g. available water capacity and field capacity) that regulate the response of C inputs (net primary productivity) and outputs (microbial decomposition) to land use and management practices (e.g. irrigation and cultivation). Therefore, soil hydraulic properties should be taken into account in designing land use for the purpose of SOC sequestration.																			0167-1987	1879-3444				SEP	2023	233								105793	10.1016/j.still.2023.105793	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2023.105793		JUN 2023											WOS:001035408200001

However, these models behave as a 'black box', meaning that the relationships between the input and predicted variables are hard to interpret. Recent regression models that downscale sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) with MODIS and weather variables are an example. The impact of weather variables on the predicted SIF in these models is unknown. The explanation of such weather-SIF relationships would aid in the understanding of climate-related constraints on photosynthesis phenology since SIF is a proxy of gross primary productivity. Here, we used SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) - a novel technique based on game theory - for explaining the contribution of input variables to the individual predictions in a machine learning model. We explored the capabilities of this technique with a weather-SIF model. The regression model predicted ESA-TROPOSIF measurements from ERA5-Land air temperature, shortwave radiation, and vapour-pressure-deficit (VPD) data. The SHAP values of the model were estimated at the start and end of the growing season for the entire globe. These values depicted the global constraints of the three climate variables on the photosynthetically active season and confirmed existing knowledge on the limiting factors of terrestrial photosynthesis with unprecedented spatial detail. Radiation was the limiting factor in tropical rainforest and VPD constrained the start and end of the growing season in tropical dryland ecosystems. In extra-tropical regions, temperature was the main limiting factor during the start of the growing season, but both temperature and radiation constrained photosynthesis at the end of the growing season. This technique may help future remote sensing studies that require the use of non-interpretable machine-learning regression models and explain how input variables contribute to the model prediction in a spatiotemporally explicit manner.

The study answers the following questions: (i) what are the typologies of CSA practices available to smallholder farmers in rural Ghana?, (ii) what is the adoption rate of CSA practices among smallholder farmers? and, (iii) what are the socioeconomic predictors of the adoption of CSA practices in rural Ghana? This paper employed mixed-method participatory approaches including surveys of 1061 households, and 15 key informant interviews supplemented with 2 regional stakeholder workshops. The study used a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to examine the climate smart agriculture typologies adopted among the smallholder farmers. To investigate the drivers of adoption, the multinomial ordered probit model was applied. The PCA results suggested that, there were seven (7) uncorrelated dimensions involving 23 CSA practices that were generally employed - water smart practices, energy smart practices, nutrient smart practices, carbon smart practices, weather smart practices, planting smart practices, and knowledge smart practices. These 7 typologies explained 63.91% of the total variance. The PCA results indicated that smallholder farmers do not necessarily rely on a single CSA practice to cope with climate change; but utilise a combination of practices. The results of the ordered probit model suggested that the factors driving the adoption of CSA practices are mixed nuanced on the adoption typology and farmers' location and institutional factors. The paper contributes to an understanding of the different typologies for CSA practices and highlights the various socioeconomic factors driving the adoption rates of CSA practices by smallholders' farmers. This is crucial for the upscale of CSA practices in the face of climate change in Ghana and West Africa more widely.																			2666-0490						2023	5								100223	10.1016/j.crsust.2023.100223	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crsust.2023.100223		MAY 2023											WOS:001009038600001

Economic and management value of weed maps at harvest in semi-arid cropping systems of the US Pacific Northwest	PRECISION AGRICULTURE												Weed maps created late in the growing season are potentially useful in regions where late maturing weeds are problematic and need to be controlled before they produce seed. The objectives of this study were to (1) spatially characterize the population dynamics of predominant weed species and apply this information into quantifying the effect of treated and untreated weed infestations on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields and (2) evaluate potential herbicide savings with post-harvest site-specific treatments. Multi-year grain yield and weed data were acquired at harvest in each of four years (2015-18) within a dryland production field (9.2 ha) in eastern Oregon. Abundance of weed species (2015) and percent cover of weed species (2016, 2017 and 2018) were visually estimated on a square grid based on dividing the field into 7-m(2) cells. Spatial patterns in the weed community were subject to rapid change and depended on year, crop and weed control strategy. While tumble mustard (Sisymbrium altissimum) was the most predominant and competitive species, the spatial distribution of this weed and that of other species varied each year. Tumble mustard and prickly lettuce (Lactuca serriola) were equally problematic in spring wheat and winter wheat whereas Russian thistle (Salsola tragus) was problematic in spring wheat and downy brome (Bromus tectorum) in winter wheat. Potential savings from site-specific herbicide application varied from 10 to 95% based on percentage of field infested. Weed maps at harvest are useful for studying weed dynamics, identifying potentially herbicide-resistant weeds and planning site-specific weed management. Combined with yield maps, weed maps at harvest are also useful for explaining crop yield variability that is associated with weed competition and weed control in furtherance of integrated weed management strategies.					, Judit/C-4507-2015	, Judit/0000-0002-4453-275X													1385-2256	1573-1618				DEC	2021	22	6					1936	1951		10.1007/s11119-021-09819-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11119-021-09819-6		JUN 2021											WOS:000658631800001
J	Souther, S; Loeser, M; Crews, TE; Sisk, T				Souther, Sara; Loeser, Matthew; Crews, Timothy E.; Sisk, Thomas			Drought exacerbates negative consequences of high-intensity cattle grazing in a semiarid grassland	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Grasslands managed for grazing are the largest land-use category globally, with a significant proportion of these grasslands occurring in semiarid and arid regions. In such dryland systems, the effect of grazing on native plant diversity has been equivocal, some studies suggesting that grazing reduces native plant diversity, others that grazing increases or has little impact on diversity. One impediment toward generalizing grazing effects on diversity in this region is that high levels of interannual variation in precipitation may obfuscate vegetative response patterns. By analyzing a long-term data set collected over a 20-yr period in a semiarid grassland, we explicitly evaluated the role of climate in regulating the effect of cattle grazing on plant communities, finding that climate interacted with grazing intensity to shape grassland communities. Community composition of plots that were intensively grazed varied considerably in response to climatic variation and native species richness was low relative to ungrazed and moderately grazed plots. Following a severe drought in 2002, exotic species richness rapidly increased in the high-intensity grazing plots. While this pattern was mirrored in the other treatments, exotic species richness increased to a greater extent and was slower to return to pre-drought levels in the high-intensity grazing plots. Overall, moderate grazing, even compared to grazing cessation, stabilized grassland communities through time, increased resilience to drought, and maintained the highest levels of native plant diversity and lowest levels of exotic diversity. These findings suggest that grazing, at moderate levels, may support grassland resilience to climate change in semiarid regions. However, grazing that exceeds tolerances, particularly in combination with extreme climatic events, like drought, can alter plant composition over relatively long timescales and possibly increase invasibility by nonnative species.

J	Wei, S; Zhang, KD; Liu, CL; Cen, YD; Xia, JQ				Wei, Shue; Zhang, Kuandi; Liu, Chenglong; Cen, Youdong; Xia, Junqiang			Effects of different vegetation components on soil erosion and response to rainfall intensity under simulated rainfall	CATENA												Vegetation effectively prevents soil erosion, however, the reductions in runoff and erosion caused by the different components of vegetation are unclear. Under simulated rainfall intensities (60, 90, and 120 mm h-1) and litter amount (5, 15, and 25 g m- 2), five different treatments were established: intact grass (IG), litter and roots (LR), canopy and roots (CR), only litter (OL), only roots (OR), and a control bare plot (CK). The effects of the canopy, roots, and litter on erosion were quantitatively analysed. (1) The runoff rate and erosion rate were reduced by different treatments, and the IG treatment most effectively reduced runoff and sediment, followed by the LR, OL, CR, and OR treatments. (2) The velocity, runoff, and sediment reductions by litter were optimal. The velocity and runoff reduction effects of the roots were stronger than those of the canopy, reducing the sediment reduction more than the litter at 5 g m- 2. The velocity, runoff, and sediment reductions produced by the canopy were weak, providing average contributions of 11.40%, 8.01%, and 7.34%, respectively. The vegetation more strongly affected sediment than runoff reduction. (3) Different treatments most effectively reduced runoff and sediment under a 60 mm h-1 rainfall. The contributions of the canopy, roots, and litter to reducing runoff and sediment decreased with increasing rainfall intensity. (4) Erosion rate and shear stress showed a linear relationship. The soil erodibility Kr and critical runoff shear stress tau c of the IG plot were lowest and highest, respectively. Litter and roots decreased Kr and increased tau c, respectively. Compared with the bare plot, Kr decreased by 44.44%-61.54% and 15.38%-40.74% and tau c increased by 3.85%-7.44% and -1.65% to 7.69% in litter and roots, respectively. This study provides insights regarding the mechanism through which vegetation controls erosion and effective scientific basis for rational vegetation allocation.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				FEB	2024	235								107652	10.1016/j.catena.2023.107652	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.107652		NOV 2023											WOS:001115804300001

However, the effects of multiple anthropogenic stressors on seasonal community stability have not been clearly elucidated, especially for vulnerable semi-arid grasslands. During the growing season in the 5th year of the experiment, we determined how nitrogen (N) addition, water addition and shrub removal altered seasonal community stability in a semi-arid grassland dominated by the shrub Caragana microphylla on the Mongolian Plateau. We found that shrub removal, N addition and water addition had different effects on the stability of community and plant functional groups (PFGs). Shrub removal increased seasonal community stability mostly via increases in the stability of perennial forbs and C-4 plants, and shrub removal did not alter the effects of N addition or water addition on seasonal community stability or PFG stability. N addition decreased seasonal community stability mostly via decreases in the stability of perennial rhizome grasses and C-4 plants. Water addition increased seasonal community stability mostly via increases in the stability of annuals and biennials, perennial forbs, perennial rhizome grasses, dominant species and C-4 plants. Species asynchrony and PFG stability but not species richness or soil abiotic or biotic variables helped to maintain seasonal community stability under N addition or water addition. Our findings indicate that future scenarios of increases in N deposition and shrub encroachment will strongly reduce community stability in drylands, and that future scenarios of increases in precipitation together with shrub removal might help to maintain the stability of this and other dryland ecosystems.

Effect of Post-Warm-Up Three Different Duration Self-Selected Active Rests on 100 Meter Swimming Performance: Preliminary Findings	MONTENEGRIN JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCE AND MEDICINE												The question of when the optimal effect of warm-up is reached after the warm-up phase in swimming competitions is still not fully elucidated. The purpose of this study was to see how self-selected active rest in three different duration periods affected 100-m maximum swimming performance. Eight well-trained elite swimmers (6 males and 2 females, mean age: 17.2 +/- 3, mean 616 FINA points) were included in the study. After the participants completed a standard warm-up consisting of dryland-based dynamic warm-up (10-min) and in-water warm-up protocols (1200-m / similar to 25-min) in 3 different sessions, they observed different transition phase periods (15, 30 and 45-min) with standard clothes in their maximum heart rate of 30% and self-selected movement forms (stretching, walking, etc.) completed by active rest. Subsequently, swimmers carried out the 100-m maximum time-trial swim test using their main stroke. Tympanic temperature (Ttympanic), forehead temperature ( Tforehead), heart rate (HR), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and maximal 100-m-time-trial ( TT) were recorded during all sessions. Measurements were evaluated in repeated measures ANOVA. Delta (.) calculation was used to score changes and strengthen the analysis. The 100-m time-trial demonstrated a trend of improvement in 30-min active rest (p=0.037). In addition, there was no difference between rest times in Tforehead, Ttympanic, HR, and RPE conditions (p>0.05). The 30-min active rest interval improved 100-m swimming performance by 1.6% and 0.8% compared to 15-min and 45-min active rest. The positive effect of pool warm-up can be maintained for up to 30 minutes with self-paced active rest.					gunay, erkan/V-7423-2017; Güdücü, Çağdaş/F-9649-2016	gunay, erkan/0000-0003-2199-9987; Güdücü, Çağdaş/0000-0002-7735-4048													1800-8755	1800-8763				SEP	2022	11	2					57	64		10.26773/mjssm.220907	http://dx.doi.org/10.26773/mjssm.220907		SEP 2022											WOS:000864704500001

Crop Wild Relatives Crosses: Multi-Location Assessment in Durum Wheat, Barley, and Lentil	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Crop wild relatives (CWR) are a good source of useful alleles for climate change adaptation. Here, 19 durum wheat, 24 barley, and 24 lentil elites incorporating CWR in their pedigrees were yield tested against commercial checks across 19 environments located in Morocco, Ethiopia, Lebanon, and Senegal. For each crop, the combined analysis of variance showed that genotype (G), environment (E), and genotype x environment (GxE) effects were significant for most of the traits. A selection index combining yield potential (G) and yield stability (GxE) was used to identify six CWR-derived elites for each crop matching or superior to the best check. A regression analysis using a climate matrix revealed that grain yield was mostly influenced by the maximum daily temperature and soil moisture level during the growing stages. These climatic factors were used to define five clusters (i.e., E1 to E5) of mega-environments. The CWR-derived elites significantly outperformed the checks in E1, E2, and E4 for durum wheat, and in E2 for both barley and lentil. The germplasm was also assessed for several food transformation characteristics. For durum wheat, one accession (Zeina) originating from T. araraticum was significantly superior in mixograph score to the best check, and three accessions originating from T. araraticum and T. urartu were superior for Zn concentration. For barley, 21 accessions originating from H. spontaneum were superior to the checks for protein content, six for Zn content, and eight for beta-glucan. For lentil, ten accessions originating from Lens orientalis were superior to the check for protein content, five for Zn, and ten for Fe concentration. Hence, the results presented here strongly support the use of CWR in breeding programs of these three dryland crops, both for adaptation to climatic stresses and for value addition for food transformation.

Based on a cold/hot spots analysis, this paper used grain yield, food prices, price index statistics, and a land use thematic map to study the impact of LUCC on four ecosystem services values (ESVs) in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration, and determine the spatial differences resulting from the rapid urbanization LUCC. The correlation between the four ecosystem services was then studied and sensitivity analyses conducted to investigate whether any changes in the ESVs could lead to unacceptable unit value transfer uncertainties. It was found that most urban land was converted from farmland, and that before 2000, the total ESVs and the regulating services values (RSVs) increased significantly, after which it declined, the provisioning services values (PSVs) declined year on year, the habitat services value (HSV) and cultural and amenity services value (CSV) declined sharply after 2000, and the spatial distribution of the four ESVs were significantly different. Over time, it was found that the hot spots were shrinking and the cold spots were spreading. The provisioning services were found to be negatively correlated with habitat services and cultural and amenity services, the regulating services were weakly positively correlated with the provisioning services and significantly positively correlated with the habitat services and cultural and amenity services, and the habitat services were significantly positively correlated with cultural and amenity services. In the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration, the water area is the most important for the total ESVs, followed by non-bush forest. Paddy field is ranked third. Dryland, bush, grassland, and wetland are less important. The importance of barren land is almost zero. This research provides the government with a scientific basis from which to formulate spatial planning and environmental protection policies for ecological sustainable development in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration.

Intransitivity increases plant functional diversity by limiting dominance in drylands worldwide	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. Biotic interactions are key determinants of plant community structure. Indirect interactions such as intransitivity (i.e., the absence of competitive hierarchies among species) have been hypothesized to benefit diversity within plant communities. However, their effect on functional diversity remains scarcely explored in real communities. Here, we develop a novel approach to infer intransitivity from plant spatial patterns and functional traits (height and specific leaf area) and quantify its effect on different components of plant diversity along environmental gradients in 100 drylands from all continents except Antarctica. 2. We first calculated the spatial association pattern for all perennials to infer competition between species. Trait values were used as a proxy of competitive hierarchies to infer the direction of these interactions. We used multiple regression models to evaluate how intransitivity responds to environmental variables (mean annual temperature and precipitation, precipitation seasonality, soil pH, sand content and woody cover). We also used confirmatory path analysis to evaluate the effects of intransitivity on species richness and evenness, trait dispersion and functional diversity. 3. Intransitivity mostly responded to climatic variables and significantly increased with precipitation scarcity and seasonality. We found that intransitivity had significant effects on functional diversity, mostly by promoting plant community evenness. However, the dominance of woody vegetation (steppes versus shrublands) modulated this effect. 4. Synthesis. Intransitivity increased the functional diversity of drylands, particularly under high rainfall seasonality, by limiting functionally dominant species. Our findings specify how intransitivity structures the functional diversity of dryland vegetation worldwide. Intransitivity may be particularly important in ecosystems where the availability of abiotic resources changes over time, thereby breaking down inherent competitive hierarchies between plant species. Neglecting intransitivity will bias our estimation of the impacts of biotic interactions on plant communities, a fundamental issue to fully understand how plant communities will respond to ongoing environmental changes.

How the effects of DW cycles on N turnover vary with the intensity and number of DW cycles and soil properties has not been clearly addressed, which hinders predicting soil biogeochemical cycles in a changing world. Herein, we examined the response of net N mineralization in agricultural soils measured at a standard temperature (25 degrees C) to DW cycles varying in intensity and number. A total of 25 soils differing in texture and organic matter content were collected to create a soil property gradient. We also established the relationships of DW cycle effects on net N mineralization to soil properties. The DW cydes significantly increased N mineralization by 11.05 +/- 0.66 mg kg(-1) (+81.7%), and the increase was consistent across DW intensities and numbers for most soils. The release of inorganic N was dependent on soil properties, while the regulation of soil properties on DW effects varied with DW intensity, with stronger regulation under intense DW cycles (60% to 0% field capacity) than under moderate DW cycles (100% to 20% field capacity). The effect of intense DW cydes on NH4+ increased with day content but decreased with soil pH and sand content. The effect on NO3- has opposite responses to these soil properties when compared with the effects on NH4+. The effect on total inorganic N increased with soil pH and inorganic N concentration. These results indicated that DW cycles have the potential to increase N availability in agricultural soils and highlighted the underestimation of N availability predicted with averaged soil moisture instead of real-time soil moisture under changing soil moisture conditions.

In this study, we analysed the herbaceous plant dynamics, measured by species diversity, composition, cover, and biomass in response to grazing pressure in the savannah ecosystems of Sahel. In Senegal, we selected four savannah sites represented with high, moderate, light and no grazing intensity levels. Transect survey methods were used for sampling the vegetation data within each of the sites. Species richness and composition were analysed using species accumulation curve and multivariate analyses. Furthermore, we used General Linear Models and a piecewise Structural Equation Model (pSEM) to examine the relationships between grazing intensity, vegetation cover, diversity and biomass.Results The herbaceous species diversity and composition varied significantly among the different grazing intensity levels (p <0.001). The plant species composition shifted from the dominance of grass cover to the dominance of forb cover with increasing grazing pressure. Moreover, the attributes of species diversity, herbaceous biomass, and ground cover were higher on sites with low grazing than sites with high and moderate grazing intensity. Across all sites, species diversity was positively related to total biomass. The pSEM explained 37% of the variance in total biomass and revealed that grazing intensity negatively influenced total biomass both directly and indirectly through its negative influence on species diversity.Conclusions Managing grazing intensity may lead to higher plant production and higher mixed forage establishment in the dryland savannah ecosystems. This information can be used to support land management strategies and promote sustainable grazing practices that balance the needs of livestock with the conservation of ecosystem health and biodiversity.

In the current study, a pot experiment was conducted to investigate the beneficial effects of dark septate endophyte (DSE) (Macrophomina pseudophaseolina, Paraphoma radicina) and Trichoderma (Trichoderma afroharzianum, Trichoderma longibrachiatum) inoculum on Astragalus mongholicus grown in sterile soil under drought stress, alone, or in combination. The addition of Trichoderma enhanced the DSE colonization in roots regardless of the water condition. Under well-watered conditions, M. pseudophaseolina inoculation significantly enhanced the biomass and root length of A. mongholicus. The two DSE and Trichoderma inoculum significantly improved calycosin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside content. However, M. pseudophaseolina + T. afroharzianum inoculation better promoted root growth, whereas co-inoculation had higher active ingredient contents compared with single inoculation, except for P. radicina + T. afroharzianum. Under drought stress, DSE and Trichoderma inoculum significantly improved root biomass, root length, calycosin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside content, and activities of nitrate reductase and soil urease. P. radicina + T. afroharzianum and P. radicina + T. longibrachiatum better increased root length, and all combinations of DSE and Trichoderma had a greater impact on the increase in formononetin content compared with the single treatments. Additionally, Trichoderma relies on antioxidant enzymes, growth hormones, and the redox system (ascorbic acid-glutathione) to resist drought, while DSE strains have an additional osmotic regulation system in addition to the drought resistance function possessed by Trichoderma, and the effect of co-inoculation (especially M. pseudophaseolina + T. longibrachiatum and P. radicina + T. afroharzianum) on plant physiological parameters was greater than that of single inoculation. This study provides a new research direction for the effects of DSE and Trichoderma on medicinal plant cultivated in dryland.

This paper studied the classification methods of irrigated drylands based on temperature, precipitation, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) from Landsat data in the one-harvest area of the northern Loess Plateau of China by using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. An extraction method was proposed for irrigated drylands in arid and semi-arid regions of northwest China. In addition, the change types of irrigated and rainfed drylands in the two periods were classified, and a method was also put forward to directly classify the change types by using the image differences between the two periods combined with the classification results of each period. It was found that combining the ratio of NDVI and NDWI with the accumulated values of temperature and precipitation of the 30 days before imaging could effectively improve the classification accuracy. Moreover, directly classifying the gaps of remote sensing factors in the time dimension before combining spatial clustering information could yield a more accurate type of change, because the accumulation of errors in the change maps obtained from the overlay analysis of distribution maps of the two periods could be avoided. The accuracy of classification could be improved by introducing the dynamic information of time dimension into the classification of historical periods. This study complements the extraction method for this type of irrigated dryland, and the classification results can improve the accuracy of existing products in terms of spatial resolution, which can fill the shortage of detailed distribution data for irrigated and rainfed drylands in this region.					zhang, xueying/JMB-7808-2023; Wang, Tianqi/JJD-7473-2023; wang, zhenhui/JMQ-0550-2023; wang, wenxin/JOZ-3291-2023; Xu, Jinyong/AAP-2479-2020; Li, Wen/JQI-4757-2023; liu, xiao/JLL-2119-2023	wang, xiao/0000-0002-8281-5224; Zhu, Zijuan/0000-0002-4314-1394; Zuo, Lijun/0000-0001-6554-0815														2072-4292				MAR	2022	14	5							1256	10.3390/rs14051256	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14051256													WOS:000769151400001

The changes of the quantity, quality, and spatial distribution of cropland will directly affect the crop potential yields, so it is very crucial to simulate future cropland distribution and predict crop potential yields to ensure the future food security. In the present study, the Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov model was employed to simulate land-use changes in Northeast China during 2015-2050. Then, the Global Agro-ecological Zones (GAEZ) model was used to predict maize potential yields in Northeast China in 2050, and the spatio-temporal changes of maize potential yields during 2015-2050 were explored. The results were the following. (1) The woodland and grassland decreased by 5.13 million ha and 1.74 million ha respectively in Northeast China from 2015 to 2050, which were mainly converted into unused land. Most of the dryland was converted to paddy field and built-up land. (2) In 2050, the total maize potential production and average potential yield in Northeast China were 218.09 million tonnes and 6880.59 kg/ha. Thirteen prefecture-level cities had maize potential production of more than 7 million tonnes, and 11 cities had maize potential yields of more than 8000 kg/ha. (3) During 2015-2050, the total maize potential production and average yield decreased by around 23 million tonnes and 700 kg/ha in Northeast China, respectively. (4) The maize potential production increased in 15 cities located in the plain areas over the 35 years. The potential yields increased in only nine cities, which were mainly located in the Sanjiang Plain and the southeastern regions. The results highlight the importance of coping with the future land-use changes actively, maintaining the balance of farmland occupation and compensation, improving the cropland quality, and ensuring food security in Northeast China.					蒲, 蒲罗曼/HHN-8497-2022	Yubo, Zhang/0000-0002-3531-9498; Yu, Lingxue/0000-0002-5565-535X; Pu, Luoman/0000-0001-9811-0272														1660-4601				FEB	2021	18	3							938	10.3390/ijerph18030938	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18030938								33499091					WOS:000615156300001
J	Fletcher, A				Fletcher, Andrew			Benchmarking break-crops with wheat reveals higher risk may limit on farm adoption	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												Typically dryland rain fed cropping systems in much of the world (Australia, North America, Europe and the Middle East) are dominated by cereals, such as wheat, even though the rotational benefits of other crops are well documented. Presumably farmers see an advantage to wheat and this paper tested the hypothesis that on-farm break-crop yields are lower compared to wheat, and more variable. Farm level yields for wheat, barley, hay, oats, triticale, canola, lupin, chickpea, and field pea were taken from a survey of Western Australian grain farms (180-302 farms per year). In general, the yield of broad leaf crops was less than cereals and more variable. Additional data were sourced from published experiments and then yields were compared with wheat using linear regression with wheat as the x-axis and break crop as the y-axis. All break-crops were more sensitive to low yielding environments than wheat, as indicated by a positive intercept with the x-axis. Barley and wheat yields were closely related (R-2 = 0.63), but in environments where yield was less than 1.25 t/ha wheat tended to yield more, while barley out yielded wheat when yields were greater than 1.25 t/ha. There was a poor relationship between either oat grain (R-2 = 0.26) or hay (R-2 = 0.10) yields and wheat indicating that these maybe potential income diversification options. Canola was the least variable (R-2 = 0.54) broadleaf crop compared to wheat, with an intercept of 0.15 t/ha and for every 1 t/ha increase in wheat yield, canola yield increased by 0.56 t/ha. If increased diversity of crop species on-farm is the objective, then varieties and management packages that increase the yield and reliability of broadleaf crops relative to wheat will need to be developed.

To investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of the carbon footprint for major crops in China, a life cycle-based carbon footprint approach was used to evaluate the carbon footprint per unit area (CFA) and per unit yield (CFY) of eight crops for the period of 1990 to 2019. Our results showed that the CFA for all major crops showed an increasing trend with time before 2016 but slowly decreased afterward, while the CFY decreased by 16-43% over the past 30 years due to the increase in crop yield. The three main grain crops, rice (4871 +/- 418 kg CO2-eq center dot ha(-1)), wheat (2766 +/- 552 kg CO2-eq center dot ha(-1)), and maize (2439 +/- 530 kg CO2-eq center dot ha(-1)), showed the highest carbon footprint and contribution to the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, mainly due to their larger cultivated areas and higher fertilizer application rates. CH4 emission was the major component of the carbon footprint for rice production, accounting for 66% and 48% of the CFA and CFY, respectively, while fertilizer production and usage were the largest components of carbon footprint for dryland crops, making up to 26-49% of the CFA and 26-50% of the CFY for different crops. The present study also highlighted the spatial and temporal patterns of the carbon footprint for major crops in China, which could serve as references for the development of best management practices for different crop production in China, to mitigate agricultural GHG emission and to pursue low-carbon agriculture.

Over 2 years, we examined how altered seasonal precipitation influenced annual plant biomass and species richness, Simpson's diversity, and community composition of annual plant communities in a dryland ecosystem that receives both winter and summer rainfall and has distinct annual plant communities in each season. Using a rainfall exclusion, collection, and distribution system, we excluded precipitation and added water during each season individually and compared responses to control plots which received ambient summer and winter precipitation. In control plots, we found five times greater annual plant biomass, twice as many species, and higher diversity in winter relative to summer. Adding water increased annual plant biomass in summer only, did not change richness or diversity in either summer or winter, and modestly shifted community composition. Excluding precipitation in either season reduced annual plant biomass, richness, and Simpson's diversity. However, in the second winter season, biomass was higher in the plots where precipitation was excluded in the previous summer seasons suggesting that reduced productivity in the summer may facilitate biomass in the winter. Our results suggest that increased precipitation in summer may have stronger short-term impacts on annual plant biodiversity and ecosystem function relative to increased winter precipitation. In contrast, decreasing precipitation may have ubiquitous negative effects on annual plants across both summer and winter but may lead to increased biomass in the following off-seasons. These patterns suggest that annual plant communities exhibit asymmetries in their community and ecosystem responses to altered seasonal precipitation and that considering the seasonality of precipitation is important for predicting the effects of altered precipitation regimes.

J	Chen, D; Wei, W; Chen, LD				Chen, Die; Wei, Wei; Chen, Liding			Effects of terracing on soil properties in three key mountainous regions of China	GEOGRAPHY AND SUSTAINABILITY												Terracing greatly affects soil properties, ecosystem services, human welfare and geographical sustainability. The purpose of this article is to determine the influence of terracing on soil properties across diverse regions in China. Three representative terrace types, including dryland loess terraces, dry-stone terraces, and paddy terraces, were selected as case study areas. Soil sampling was stratified according to thickness of soil layers in each terraced area. Based on field investigations and soil sampling, combined with the means of variance, correlation, redundancy and regression analysis, we analyzed the characteristics of soil properties in the terraces across three areas. Results showed that: (1) alterations of soil physicochemical properties mainly depend on differences between soil parent materials in such regions; (2) Due to the existence of "four-element isomorphism " in the ecosystem and reasonable human activities, paddy terraces had the greatest impact on soil properties which is mainly reflected in decreasing soil pH and increasing SOC, TN, and TIC; (3) The content of SOC and TN in different areas was higher in terraced fields than in the sloped lands and decreased with soil deepening; (4) To maintain sufficient supply of soil nutrients and support the sustainability of agricultural terraces, it is necessary to apply manure to improve soil fertility and accelerate its aggregation in the terraces. For example, an increase in the application of nitrogen fertilizer in terraced fields in Hebei and Gansu provinces, which have a serious deficiency in soil available phosphorus (AP), is necessary to get greater amounts of P fertilization. The present study offers a theoretical foundation for the sustainability of terraced ecosystems through efficient crop production, which is the basis for strengthening the ecological security of terraced areas and promoting regional sustainability in those fragile mountains.																			2096-7438	2666-6839				SEP	2021	2	3					195	206		10.1016/j.geosus.2021.08.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geosus.2021.08.002		SEP 2021											WOS:000710675400006

Rock removal associated with agricultural intensification will exacerbate the loss of reptile diversity	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												Rocky environments host rich levels of biodiversity and provide vital habitat for specialised organisms, range-restricted species and a broad range of ectotherms adapted to saxicoline environments. In Australia, rock habitat is being destroyed during soil amelioration practices associated with agricultural intensification. Advances in rock crushing technology, developed to expand or increase crop yields and efficiency, pose an undocumented threat to global biodiversity, especially reptiles dependent on non-renewable rock habitat in agricultural landscapes. Rock removal is a legislated key threatening process in parts of Australia and will accelerate biodiversity loss if not mitigated. We estimated reptile species' range overlap with dryland cropping and modified pastoral regions within the Australian wheat-sheep zone to assess the potential impacts of rock crushing practices. We examined species- and family-richness within the impact zone and across bioregions within the impact zone, to identify areas where rock removal has the greatest potential to impact terrestrial and fossorial squamates. Our analysis revealed that 159 potentially impacted reptile species occur within the study area, representing 16% of Australian terrestrial squamates. Fourteen of these species, including six threatened species, have more than 50% range overlap with areas of intensive agriculture, and include several endangered pygopodids, scincids and agamids. Bioregions rich in rock and burrow-dwelling reptiles include the Brigalow Belt South, Murray Darling Depression, Darling Riverine Plains, Eyre Yorke Block, Avon Wheatbelt, Nandewar, Flinders Lofty Block and New South Wales South Western Slopes. Synthesis and applications. The conservation of reptiles in agricultural landscapes requires appropriate management and retention of surface rocks. Potential yield increases from destroying rock habitat to intensify or expand cropland will not compensate for the net loss of reptile populations dependent on non-renewable resources. Financial incentives to prevent the expansion and transformation of non-arable landscapes to cropland are required to prevent the ongoing loss of biodiversity.

Impact of different destocking strategies on the resilience of dry rangelands	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Half of the world's livestock live in (semi-)arid regions, where a large proportion of people rely on animal husbandry for their survival. However, overgrazing can lead to land degradation and subsequent socio-economic crises. Sustainable management of dry rangeland requires suitable stocking strategies and has been the subject of intense debate in the last decades. Our goal is to understand how variations in stocking strategies affect the resilience of dry rangelands. We describe rangeland dynamics through a simple mathematical model consisting of a system of coupled differential equations. In our model, livestock density is limited only by forage availability, which is itself limited by water availability. We model processes typical of dryland vegetation as a strong Allee effect, leading to bistability between a vegetated and a degraded state, even in the absence of herbivores. We study analytically the impact of varying the stocking density and the destocking adaptivity on the resilience of the system to the effects of drought. By using dynamical systems theory, we look at how different measures of resilience are affected by variations in destocking strategies. We find that the following: (1) Increasing stocking density decreases resilience, giving rise to an expected trade-off between productivity and resilience. (2) There exists a maximal sustainable livestock density above which the system can only be degraded. This carrying capacity is common to all strategies. (3) Higher adaptivity of the destocking rate to available forage makes the system more resilient: the more adaptive a system is, the bigger the losses of vegetation it can recover from, without affecting the long-term level of productivity. The first two results emphasize the need for suitable dry rangeland management strategies, to prevent degradation resulting from the conflict between profitability and sustainability. The third point offers a theoretical suggestion for such a strategy.					G. Mayor, Angeles/U-4949-2017	G.

We hypothesized that vegetation trends were highly density-dependent with intensified browning in dense canopies and increased greening in sparse canopies. We exploited this insight by estimating vegetation trends in peak growth from dense to sparse canopies graded from 1 to 20 using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend test based on the 500 m 8-day composite MODIS Near Infrared Reflectance of terrestrial vegetation (NIRv) time series datasets in the past two decades (2001-2019) at the global scale. We found that global greening increased by 1.42% per grade with strong fit before grade 15 (R-2 = 0.95): net browning (11% browning vs 9% greening) exhibited in high-density canopies (NIRv > 0.39) in contrast to 32% greening in low-density canopies (NIRv asymptotic to 0.15). While the density-dependent greening was evidenced across different biomes and ecosystems, the steepest gradient (changes per grade) in cropland highlighted the increasingly intensified agricultural activities globally. Greening gradients declined in the dryland, but enhanced in the High-latitude ecosystems driven by warming, especially in the shrubland. Density-dependent vegetation trends were accounted for by the disproportionately impacts from climate changes and the un-equal contributions of Land Cover Changes (LCC) among dense and sparse canopies. Vegetation trends and greening gradients could be extensively facilitated by Wetting or Decreasing solar Radiation (WDR), especially in sparse grass -land and shrubland. Browning was dominant in dense canopies, which was further aggravated by Drying and Increasing solar Radiation (DIR), especially woody vegetation. This study implied the widespread degradation or mortality of highly productive vegetation hidden among global greening dominant in open ecosystems, which might be further exacerbated by the predicted increasing drought under global warming.

The objective of this study was to determine a suite of soil health indicators that were sensitive to cropping systems and N fertilization and relate to soil properties and dryland crop yield in a 14-yr-old cropping sequence and N fertilization study in eastern Montana, USA. Main-plot (cropping sequence) treatments were conventional till barley (Hordeum vulgaris L.)/spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow (CTWF), no-till continuous barley/spring wheat (NTCW), no-till barley/spring wheat-fallow (NTWF), and no-till barley/spring wheat-pea (Pisum sativum L.) (NTWP) and split-plot (N fertilization) treatments were 0 (N0) and 80/100 kg N ha(-1) (N1) applied to barley and spring wheat. Barley was grown for the first six years that was replaced by spring wheat for the last eight years. The NTCW increased aggregate stability, wet aggregate stability index, average slake aggregate, P concentration, KMNO4-extractableC, CO2 flush (1 d incubation), potentially mineralizable N, and N-acetyl beta-glucosaminidase (NAG), but reduced NO3-N concentration compared to other treatments. Water-stable aggregation, macro-porosity, volumetric water content at water saturation, and Mg concentration were greater with N0, but water-extractable total N and NO3-N concentration were greater with N1. Mean crop (barley/spring wheat) yield from 2006 to 2019 were greater in NTCW with N1 than other treatments. Multivariate analysis showed that phospholipid-derived fatty acid (PLFA) and CO2 flush at 4-d incubation were negatively related to Ca and Al concentrations, but positively to crop yield. Microbial abundance and activity can be used as important soil health indicators that were enhanced by no-tillage with increased cropping intensity and related to crop yield.

Improving our understanding of the rate, timing, and distribution of landscape change is needed to determine the impact on wildlife populations and biodiversity, ultimately leading to better-informed management regarding requirements for habitat amount and its connectedness. In this research, we assessed the viability of an approach to detect from-to class changes designed to be scalable to the prairie region with the capacity for local refinement. It employed a deep-learning convolutional neural network to model general land covers and examined class memberships to identify land-cover conversions. For this implementation, eight land-cover categories were derived from the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Annual Space-Based Crop Inventory. Change was assessed in three study areas that contained different mixes of grassland, pasture, and forest cover. Results showed that the deep-learning method produced the highest accuracy across all classes relative to an implementation of random forest that included some first-order texture measures. Overall accuracy was 4% greater with the deep-learning classifier and class accuracies were more balanced. Evaluation of change accuracy suggested good performance for many conversions such as grassland to crop, forest to crop, water to dryland covers, and most bare/developed-related changes. Changes involving pasture with grassland or cropland were more difficult to detect due to spectral confusion among classes. Similarly, conversion to forests in some cases was poorly detected due to gradual and subtle change characteristics combined with confusion between forest, shrub, and croplands. The proposed framework involved several processing steps that can be explored to enhance the thematic content and accuracy for large regional implementation. Evaluation for understanding connectivity in natural land covers and related declines in species at risk is planned for future research.																				2072-4292				FEB	2021	13	4							634	10.3390/rs13040634	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13040634													WOS:000624445200001

Drought responses of profile plant-available water and fine-root distributions in apple (<i>Malus pumila</i> Mill.) orchards in a loessial, semi-arid, hilly area of China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The number of apple (Malus pumila Mill.) orchards has increased substantially in hilly regions of the Loess Plateau of China, as a significant element of the large-scale 'Grain for Green' ecological rehabilitation program that aims to conserve soil and water while improving the regions economic prospects. However, the long-term effects of the orchard expansion and the adaptive responses of apple trees to drought are not known. Thus, using a space-for-time substitution approach, we investigated plant-available water and fine-root distribution in the 0-8 m soil profile in apple orchards of various ages in a dry year (2015,392 mm rainfall) and the following year with normal precipitation (2016,500 mm rainfall). We found that plant-available water gradually decreased with stand age in the dry year, but increased in the normal year, especially in the 0-2 m soil layer. Fine root (<2 mm diameter) distribution and biomass increased with stand age and decreased with increasing soil depth in all treatment plots, predominantly in the 0-2 m layer. In all treatment plots, most of the soil layers in the deep soil (>2 m) had soil moisture storage deficit. In the dry year (2015), the apple trees increased both the average depth (D-50 and D-95 values) and biomass of their fine-root systems in response to water stress, relative to the normal year (2016). Thus, the apple trees extracted water primarily from the shallow (<2 m) layers in the normal year, but from deeper soil layers in the dry year, to sustain growth. The results of this study will help to guide land and agricultural water management in rainfed apple orchards in hilly regions of the Loess Plateau and similar dryland regions.

Soil alkalinity can cause nutrient deficiencies and toxic effects, and inhibit rooting depth, which can have a detrimental impact on crop production. The depth at which a soil constraint is reached is important information for land managers, but it is difficult to measure or predict spatially. This study predicted the depth in which a pH (H2O) constraint (>9) was reached to a 1-cm vertical resolution to a 100-cm depth, on a 1070-hectare dryland cropping farm. Equal-area quadratic smoothing splines were used to resample vertical soil profile data, and a random forest (RF) model was used to produce the depth-to-soil pH constraint map. The RF model was accurate, with a Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficient (LCCC) of 0.63-0.66, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.47-0.51 when testing with leave-one-site-out cross-validation. Approximately 77% of the farm was found to be constrained by a strongly alkaline pH greater than 9 (H2O) somewhere within the top 100 cm of the soil profile. The relationship between the predicted depth-to-soil pH constraint map and cotton and grain (wheat, canola, and chickpea) yield monitor data was analyzed for individual fields. Results showed that yield increased when a soil pH constraint was deeper in the profile, with a good relationship for wheat, canola, and chickpea, and a weaker relationship for cotton. The overall results from this study suggest that the modelling approach is valuable in identifying the depth-to-soil pH constraint, and could be adopted for other important subsoil constraints, such as sodicity. The outputs are also a promising opportunity to understand crop yield variability, which could lead to improvements in management practices.

Unreasonable development and utilization of these heavy metals will cause severe pollution to the soils and consequently bring damage to human health. Therefore, recovering soils polluted by heavy metals is crucial. An indoor pot experiment was carried out involving seven treatments, namely, low-concentration Cu stress (Cu1), high-concentration Cu stress (Cu2), low-concentration Cd stress (Cd1), high-concentration Cd stress (Cd2), low-concentration Cu-Cd combined stress (Cu1Cd1), and high-concentration Cu-Cd combined stress (Cu2Cd2), and an uncontaminated soil as a control. Results demonstrated that the net photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content are approximately 8.36-72.51% and 7.22-36.50%, respectively, lower under the Cu, Cd, and Cu-Cd combined stresses than under the control. The net photosynthetic rates are higher under Cu2 and Cd2 than under Cu1 and Cd1; by contrast, the net photosynthetic rate of leaves is lower under Cu2Cd2 than under Cu1Cd1. The net photosynthesis rate of Cinnamomum camphora is significantly positively correlated with superoxide dismutase activity but is significantly negatively correlated with the total chlorophyll, malondialdehyde, soluble sugar, and proline contents. Young Cinnamomum camphora grows well under Cu, Cd, and Cu-Cd combined stresses and is applicable in ecologically restoring heavy metal-contaminated soils.

Based on the principle of niche competition, screening plants with strong competitiveness and managing vacant niches through natural alternative methods (replacement control) were expected to achieve sustainable ecological management of invasive species. To this end, two legumes, Desmodium heterocarpon and Senna tora, were selected to conduct field competition experiments with M. micrantha to investigate the interspecific competitiveness of these two legumes and M. micrantha from the aspects of adaptability to low light and response to drought stress. We found that the relative interaction indexes of D. heterocarpon and S. tora to M. micrantha were both negative and the competitive inhibition of S. tora on M. micrantha was higher than that of D. heterocarpon. Compared with M. micrantha, D. heterocarpon and S. tora have higher photosynthetic efficiency and lower dark respiration efficiency under low-light conditions, thus maintaining positive plant carbon balance capacity in the low-light understory and becoming more shade-tolerant. Besides, the water stress experiment found that M. micrantha had the lowest tolerance to drought stress, followed by S. tora, and D. heterocarpon was the most drought tolerant. These results showed that D. heterocarpon and S. tora can effectively prevent and control M. micrantha, mainly due to their higher competitiveness, shade tolerance, and drought tolerance. The control effect of D. heterocarpon is better than that of S. tora which is an alien species. Therefore, we believed that the replacement control of the invasive weed M. micrantha by D. heterocarpon is expected to be a sustainable ecological management strategy for M. micrantha biocontrol in the dryland orchard habitat. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the selection of species for alternative control in the future and provide new ideas for solving the problem of repeated regeneration in the existing M. micrantha control process.																			2296-701X					DEC 19	2022	10								1095946	10.3389/fevo.2022.1095946	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2022.1095946													WOS:000905569800001

Using sUAV imagery to map litter of invasive annual grass in dry environmental conditions	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Invasive annual grasses pose a severe threat to drylands of the United States by increasing habitat degradation and the occurrence and severity of wildfires, while simultaneously outcompeting native species. Advances in technology and accessibility of small uncrewed aerial vehicles (sUAV) provide the opportunity for small preserve managers to map and monitor plant invasions in critical habitats for rare and endemic plant species. Many remote sensing techniques rely on the invasive plants' different phenological signals to distinguish them from native plants and habitats. However, invasive annual grasses in the western United States have high variability of interannual productivity and may not green up each year. Therefore, our objective was to use an sUAV (quadcopter drone) to map invasive annual grass regardless of phenological stage in critical Mojave Desert habitat. The study locations were White Dome, a small habitat preserve, and Beehive Dome in Washington County UT, USA. These areas are critical habitats for several endangered and threatened plant species and are covered with sensitive biological soil crusts, making on-the-ground measurements destructive. Using imagery collected with an sUAV we created red, green, blue (RGB) orthomosaics and calculated the Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI) across these areas. We successfully mapped the litter of invasive annual grasses at one of the two sites. At White Dome, we attained 95.2 % and 84.3 % Producer's and User's Accuracy in mapping invasive annual grasses based on the RGB spectral signature of invasive grass litter. At Beehive Dome, the heterogeneous nature of the edaphic and topographical features made it difficult to accurately map (<20 %) using VARI and RGB alone. Here, we propose plans to increase accuracy in these dryland systems to be able to map invasive annual grasses regardless of year or environmental conditions.

These agricultural activities have profoundly impacted soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in global drylands. However, the effects of clearing natural ecosystems for cropland (CNEC) on SOC are uncertain. To improve our understanding of carbon emissions and sequestration under different land uses, it is necessary to characterize the response patterns of SOC stocks to different types of CNEC. We conducted a meta-analysis with mixed-effect model based on 873 paired observations of SOC in croplands and adjacent natural ecosystems from 159 individual studies in global drylands. Our results indicate that CNEC significantly (p < .05) affects SOC stocks, resulting from a combination of natural land clearing, cropland management practices (fertilizer application, crop species, cultivation duration) and the significant negative effects of initial SOC stocks. Increases in SOC stocks (in 1 m depth) were found in croplands which previously natural land (deserts and shrublands) had low SOC stocks, and the increases were 278.86% (95% confidence interval, 196.43%-361.29%) and 45.38% (26.53%-62.23%), respectively. In contrast, SOC stocks (in 1 m depth) decreased by 24.11% (18.38%-29.85%) and 10.70% (1.80%-19.59%) in clearing forests and grasslands for cropland, respectively. We also established the general response curves of SOC stocks change to increasing cultivation duration, which is crucial for accurately estimating regional carbon dynamics following CNEC. SOC stocks increased significantly (p < .05) with high long-term fertilizer consumption in cleared grasslands with low initial SOC stocks (about 27.2 Mg ha(-1)). The results derived from our meta-analysis could be used for refining the estimation of dryland carbon dynamics and developing SOC sequestration strategies to achieve the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere.

A case study of Ziwuling Mountain Region, China	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Ecological vulnerability assessment is an effective tool to aid decision-makers in understanding the impact of natural and anthropogenic variables on ecosystems. Yet, we know little about incorporating ecological vulner-ability into accurate decision-making for climate change adaptation and human activities governance. This study proposes a comprehensive framework to link the Vulnerability Scoping Diagram (VSD) model, Analytic Hier-archy Process-Entropy method, hot spot and cluster analysis into ecological vulnerability assessment and man-agement in the Ziwuling Mountain Region (ZMR), a typical loessial forest landscape in arid China. There were significant spatial and temporal changes in the exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity index in the ZMR from 1990 to 2017. The exposure and adaptive capacity index increased from 1990 to 2017. The subareas with a high exposure value were distributed in the north and south ZMR, and the subareas with a high adaptive capacity value were distributed in the east ZMR. The ecological vulnerability declined during the study period, with the smaller value subareas allocated in the middle and south ZMR and higher value in the north and southwest. Significant spatial clustering patterns on the hot and cold spots of ecological vulnerability existed in the ZMR. The clustering subareas of hot spots on ecological vulnerability were mainly characterized by dry steppe, less precipitation, and less vegetation coverage. The subareas of cold spots of ecological vulnerability were domi-nated by forestry and forestry-agricultural landscapes. Some suggestions and countermeasures were put forward for adaptive management and sustainability enhancement. Our results provide integrative methods linking the VSD model, AHP-entropy method, hot spot and cluster analysis to ecological vulnerability reduction and adaptive management for dryland sustainability, especially for the forest social-ecological systems in the Chinese Loess Plateau.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2022	143								109379	10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109379	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109379		SEP 2022											WOS:000862267300004

Differences in the metabolic and functional mechanisms used to tolerate flooding in Guazuma ulmifolia (Lam.) from flood-prone Amazonian and dry Cerrado savanna populations	TREE PHYSIOLOGY												Flood tolerance is crucial to the survival of tree species subject to long periods of flooding, such as those present in the Amazonian varzea. Tolerance can be mediated by adjustments of metabolism, physiology and morphology, reinforcing the need to investigate the physiological and biochemical mechanisms used by tropical tree species to survive this stress. Moreover, such mechanisms may vary between populations that are subjected to differences in the frequency of flooding events. Here, we aimed to identify the mechanisms used by two populations of the tropical tree Guazuma ulmifolia (Lam.) to tolerate flooding: an Amazonian population frequently exposed to flooding and a Cerrado population, adapted to a dry environment. Young plants were subjected to a flooding of the roots and lower stem for 32 days, followed by 17 days of recovery. Amazonian plants exhibited greater increases in shoot length and higher maximum photosynthetic rate (A(max)) compared with non-flooded plants from 7 days of flooding onwards, whereas increased A(max) occurred later in flooded Cerrado plants and was not accompanied by increased shoot length. Lactate accumulated in roots of Cerrado plants after 24 h flooding, together with transcripts coding for lactate dehydrogenase in roots of both Cerrado and Amazonian plants. After 7 days of flooding, lactate decreased and alcohol dehydrogenase activity increased transiently, together with concentrations of alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid and succinate, indicating activation of metabolic processes associated with low oxygen availability. Other amino acids also increased in flooded Cerrado plants, revealing more extensive metabolic changes than in Amazonian plants. Wetland and dryland populations of G. ulmifolia revealed the great capacity to tolerate flooding stress through a suite of alterations in photosynthetic gas exchange and metabolism. However, the integrated physiological, biochemical and molecular analyses realized here indicated that wetland plants acclimatized more efficiently with increased shoot elongation and more rapid restoration of normal metabolism.

Monitoring Irrigation Events and Crop Dynamics Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Time Series	REMOTE SENSING												Capturing and identifying field-based agricultural activities, such as the start, duration and end of irrigation, together with crop sowing/germination, growing period and time of harvest, offer informative metrics that can assist in precision agricultural activities in addition to broader water and food security monitoring efforts. While optically based band-ratios, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI), have been used as descriptors for monitoring crop dynamics, data are not always available due to the influence of clouds and other atmospheric effects on optical sensors. Satellite-based microwave systems, such as the synthetic aperture radar (SAR), offer an all-weather advantage in monitoring soil and crop conditions. In this paper, we leverage the relative strengths of both optical- and microwave-based approaches by combining high resolution Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical imagery to monitor irrigation events and crop dynamics in a dryland agricultural landscape. A microwave backscatter model was used to analyze the responses of simulated backscatters to soil moisture, NDVI and NDWI (both are correlated with vegetation water content and can be regarded as vegetation descriptors), allowing an empirical relationship between these two platforms. A correlation analysis was also performed using Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical data over crops of maize, alfalfa, carrot and Rhodes grass in Al Kharj farm of Saudi Arabia to identify an appropriate SAR-based vegetation descriptor. The results illustrate the relationship between SAR and both NDVI and NDWI and demonstrated the relationship between the cross-polarization ratio (VH/VV) and the two optical indices. We explore the capacity of this multi-platform and multi-sensor approach to inform on the spatio-temporal dynamics of a range of agricultural activities, which can be used to facilitate field-based management decisions.

T.; Assine, Mario L.; Wolski, Piotr; Coetzee, Grace			Significantly enhanced mid Holocene fluvial activity in a globally important, arid-zone wetland: The Okavango Delta, Botswana	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Information on past dryland environments is commonly derived from geomorphological landforms and sediments ('geoproxies'). The Okavango Delta in the middle Kalahari, Botswana, has been subject to a long history of arid-humid transitions but its potentially rich archive of fluvial geoproxies is largely untapped. Previous palaeoenvironmental studies in the Delta region have focused mainly on aeolian dunes, lacustrine beach ridges, and rare pollen sequences in surrounding locations, and the Delta's channel dynamics have remained poorly constrained, both chronologically and in quantitative palaeohydrological terms. Focusing on the Delta's Xugana region, we present the first optically stimulated luminescence ages for palaeochannel fills and scroll bars, revealing significantly enhanced fluvial activity in the similar to 7-4 ka interval. Along 120-150 m-wide, sand-bed, sinuous palaeochannels, lateral migration and bend cutoffs were driven by palaeodischarges up to similar to 350-450 m(3) s(-1), at least nine times those of the present-day channels. These palaeochannels represent the last major phase of meander activity in the middle and lower Delta. The palaeodischarges imply significantly higher rainfall over the catchment in the mid Holocene, possibly resulting from a southwards shift of the African tropical rainbelt. Over the last few thousand years, diminished fluvial activity in the Xugana region has continued; <20 m-wide channels with discharges typically <40 m(3) s(-1) have been more laterally stable, albeit subject to local avulsions. These findings provide the 'missing link' between evidence for past intervals of enhanced rainfall in the Delta's tributary catchments in the northwest and west and the filling of large lacustrine basins to the southeast and east. The findings contribute to improved understanding of changing Kalahari hydroclimates and support growing evidence indicating that the mid to late Holocene was a time of significant fluvial transformation across many of the world's drylands.

However, how community-level foliar stoichiometric characteristic variations respond to aridity and salinity is still not well-known. Methods We calculated community weighted means (CWMs) and non-weighted means (CMs) of foliar C, N, and P concentrations (and their ratios) in a dryland plant community respond to high (HSW) and low soil moisture and salinity (LSW). Based on a sum of squares decomposition method, we determined the relative contributions of intraspecific variation and species turnover in both HSW and LSW habitats. Results The CWMs of foliar C, C:N and C:P, and CM of N in the HSW habitat were significantly greater than those in the LSW habitat. The trait variations in two habitats were mainly driven by intraspecific variation, and its contribution to trait variation mostly declined with the decrease of soil moisture and salinity. The CWMs of foliar C-related stoichiometric characteristics were mainly dominated by species turnover in both habitats. Moreover, the contribution of species turnover to C and C:P variations showed an increasing trend in the LSW habitat. For CWMs, negative covariations between intraspecific variation and turnover occurred in HSW and positive covariations (except N:P) occurred in LSW; however, CMs were generally positively correlated in both habitats. Conclusions The intraspecific variation declined as drought stress intensified, which indicates that the adaptability of desert plants declined when the stress changed from salinity to aridity. The total variation of C-related traits in both habitats were mainly dominated by species turnover. These findings highlight the importance of intraspecific variation in driving desert plant response of community functional composition to salt stress, and the joint role of intraspecific variation and species turnover in resisting drought stress.																			1932-6203					FEB 17	2021	16	2							e0246672	10.1371/journal.pone.0246672	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246672								33596232					WOS:000620633200036

Previous studies showed that the functional role of AMF was frequently dependent on soil moisture and planting densities in the semiarid environment. However, a systematic quantitative analysis of the effects of AMF inoculation on crop productivity and soil quality needs to be investigated. Therefore, a 2-year field experiment was conducted to test the inoculation effects of AMF (Funneliformis mosseae) on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) productivity and soil quality in the semiarid Loess Plateau under two water regimes (irrigated and non-irrigated) with seven plant densities in year 2017 and 2018. Our results showed that in the non-irrigated treatment, inoculation with AMF greatly increased dryland wheat aboveground biomass, crop productivity, water use efficiency, rhizosphere soil organic carbon, soil organic carbon to total nitrogen ratio, microbial biomass carbon to nitrogen ratio, and microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen (P<0.05) compared to the non-inoculated treatment. For example, compared with non-inoculated plants, the grain yield in the non-irrigated but inoculated plants increased by 59<plus/minus>28% in 2017 and 36 +/- 2.8% in 2018, and the water use efficiency for grain increased by 53 +/- 26% and 25 +/- 12% in 2017 and 2018, respectively. However, the different results were observed under irrigated conditions. In the irrigated treatment, AMF inoculation had a slightly positive effect on grain yield and soil quality at low plant density but was negative at higher plant densities. Here we demonstrated for the first time that AMF inoculation significantly improved wheat productivity and soil quality, while its effects were conditionally density- and moisture-dependent. Therefore, optimizing AMF addition is an effective measure for sustainable agricultural development and provides a novel solution for the management of soil degradation management in the semiarid area of the Loess Plateau.

Ecology rather than people restrict gene flow in Okavango-Kalahari lions	ANIMAL CONSERVATION												Reduced gene exchange between animal populations may be an indicator of the effects of anthropogenic fragmentation or it may reflect natural gradients in the landscape that can also result in population fragmentation. It can be difficult, therefore, to disentangle the role of local ecology from anthropogenic factors, creating a risk of attributing a lack of gene flow as being due to human activities, leading to ill-informed management decisions. Here, we test the ecological and anthropogenic factors driving population differentiation and show how the relative influence of such effects can be identified. Using Bayesian clustering and a causal modelling approach, we combine genetic and remote sensing data to disentangle the confounding influences of ecological and anthropogenic fragmentation. We investigate a region where such confusion may arise; in and around the Okavango Delta in northern Botswana. Specifically, we used 20 microsatellites to investigate the genetic structuring of African lionsPanthera leooccupying a landscape dominated by two very different environments, the wetland Okavango and the surrounding Kalahari Desert. We find that differences in ecology, rather than anthropogenic barriers, are driving genetic differences in the population and that despite their ability to disperse long distances these lion populations are differentiated into two distinct genetic groups, one inhabiting the wetland Okavango Delta and the other one inhabiting the surrounding dryland Kalahari, divided by an apparently unobstructed boundary. The genetic structure observed could easily have been misinterpreted as a response to anthropogenic disturbance reducing gene flow. This reinforces the need to consider non-anthropogenic hypotheses, such as ecological differences between habitats, when assessing possible mechanisms of gene flow and their implications for population management. As anthropogenic pressure increases in this region, we recommend conservation managers consider the Okavango population as a separate conservation unit, but also recognize the importance of maintaining the current structural landscape connectivity.

The catchment experienced a rapid expansion of plantation forest in the late 1990s due to tax benefits for forestry Managed Investment Schemes. This paper assesses the landscape effect of incentive based policies by measuring the land use and land cover (LULC) response in the catchment, and forecasts LULC change. The paper applies a spatial modelling procedure that integrates Markov transition probabilities, multilayer perceptron neural network and cellular automata to provide an accurate forecast of LULC change over 35 years from 1979 to 2014. In the first stage, geospatial analysis determines the spatial drivers of LULC conversions. Second, Markov transition probability matrices are estimated, and the multilayer perceptron was trained to determine a model for every transition based on spatial drivers. Finally, a cellular automata model was applied to forecast spatially explicit changes in LULC to 2025 under the current policy regime. The predictive power of the model was validated with Kappa statistics, and vis-a-visa null model. The simulation forecasts an increase in the agricultural areas by 2025 compared to 2014; whereas harvested native forest areas were predicted to decrease, contributing to a slight increase of the native forest areas. Despite government efforts to increase the areas of plantations, the model predicts a decrease in this land use due to a progressive reduction in tax incentives provided to Managed Investment Schemes. These results will assist decision-makers in improving policy, by working through the long-term implications of policy incentives for forestry in terms of broader landscape objectives related to salinity and conservation.

First, the structure, technical parameters, and working principles of the machine were introduced; second, the theoretical analysis and optimization of key components were performed; and finally, with the advancing speed of the machine, the speed of the threshing drum, and the speed of the suction fan as independent variables and the rate of removal and the total loss rate as response values, a three-factor, three-level response surface analysis method was used. For each component and response value, a mathematical model was created, and the factors and their interactions were evaluated and confirmed. The results demonstrated that the three parameters impact the threshing drum speed, advancing speed, and centrifugal fan speed in that order of priority, as well as the total loss rate in that order of priority. The machine's optimal operating settings were 1.5 m center dot s(-1) advancing speed, 788.49 r center dot min(-1) threshing drum speed, and 885.34 r center dot min(-1) centrifugal fan speed, and the validation test results indicated that under the typical dryland dense flax cultivation mode, it had a 97.46% threshing rate and 2.99% total loss rate after the test. This demonstrated that optimizing operational parameters may decrease losses in the process of mechanical flax harvesting, enhance harvesting efficiency, and satisfy the marketable flax harvesting standards.																				2077-0472				FEB	2023	13	2							229	10.3390/agriculture13020229	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13020229													WOS:000937992000001

To understand the underlying genetic mechanisms, this study aimed to dissect the quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with yield components and kernel traits in two wheat cultivars `TAM 112' and `Duster' under both irrigated and dryland environments. A set of 182 recombined inbred lines (RIL) derived from the cross of TAM 112/Duster were planted in 13 diverse environments for evaluation of 18 yield and kernel related traits. High-density genetic linkage map was constructed using 5,081 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). QTL mapping analysis detected 134 QTL regions on all 21 wheat chromosomes, including 30 pleiotropic QTL regions and 21 consistent QTL regions, with 10 QTL regions in common. Three major pleiotropic QTL on the short arms of chromosomes 2B (57.5 - 61.6 Mbps), 2D (37.1 - 38.7 Mbps), and 7D (66.0 - 69.2 Mbps) colocalized with genes Ppd-B1, Ppd-D1, and FT-D1, respectively. And four consistent QTL associated with kernel length (KLEN), thousand kernel weight (TKW), plot grain yield (YLD), and kernel spike(-1) (KPS) (Qklen.tamu.1A.325, Qtkw.tamu.2B.137, Qyld.tamu.2D.3, and Qkps.tamu.6A.113) explained more than 5% of the phenotypic variation. QTL Qklen.tamu.1A.325 is a novel QTL with consistent effects under all tested environments. Marker haplotype analysis indicated the QTL combinations significantly increased yield and kernel traits. QTL and the linked markers identified in this study will facilitate future marker-assisted selection (MAS) for pyramiding the favorable alleles and QTL map-based cloning.

Thus in addition to nitrate, the absorption of ammonium can be an important strategy that promotes rapid plant growth at strong nitrogen demanding stages. The present study reports the functional characterization of three root-expressed ammonium transporters (AMTs), aiming at finding out functional and regulatory properties that correlate with efficient nitrogen acquisition of maize. Using a stable electrophysiological recording method we previously established inXenopus laevisoocytes that integrates the capture of currents in response to voltage ramps with onsite stability controls, we demonstrate that all three ZmAMT1s engage NH(4)(+)uniporting as ammonium uptake mechanisms. TheK(m)value for ZmAMT1.1a, 1.1b, or ZmAMT1.3 is, respectively, 9.9, 15.6, or 18.6 mu M, indicating a typical high-affinity transport of NH(4)(+)ions. Importantly, the uptake currents of these ZmAMT1s are markedly amplified upon extracellular acidification. A pH drop from 7.4 to 5.4 results in a 140.8%, 64.1% or a 120.7% increase of ammonium uptake activity through ZmAMT1.1a, 1.1b, or ZmAMT1.3. Since ammonium uptake by plant roots accompanies a spontaneous acidification to the root medium, the functional promotion of ZmAMT1.1a, 1.1b, and ZmAMT1.3 by low pH is in line with the facilitated ammonium uptake activity in maize roots. Furthermore, the expression of the threeZmAMT1genes is induced under ammonium-dominated conditions. Thus we describe a facilitated ammonium uptake strategy in maize roots by functional and expression regulations of ZmAMT1 transporters that may coordinate with efficient acquisition of this form of nitrogen source when available.					cheng, cheng/JBR-8359-2023; liang, liang/IAO-8518-2023														1664-462X					JUN 26	2020	11								884	10.3389/fpls.2020.00884	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2020.00884								32676086					WOS:000551799100001
J	Kirkegaard, JA				Kirkegaard, John A.			Incremental transformation: Success from farming system synergy	OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE												Those not immediately involved in managing a dryland farm sustainably in a risky water-limited environment such as Australia may think a comparison with rocket science a bit of a stretch. But if the level of challenge, the importance to humanity, the long-term multidisciplinary team approach and planning required, and the level of uncertainty inherent in the pursuit are measures, then I think the comparison is warranted. The importance of the farming systems agronomy research that has supported agriculture and food security in Australia and globally since William Farrer's time perhaps receives less public attention than some other science areas such as genetics, genomics, or digital agriculture-indeed, agriculture is now literally "rocket science" as satellite-guided machines and sensors gather volumes of data about the soils, plants, and weather on farms at scales and speeds hitherto impossible. Yet despite spectacular advances in individual genetic or management technologies, few have been singularly transformational. Rather significant productivity improvements generally arise when a combination of technologies, often old and new are integrated and synergize in specific ways within a system-a process here termed incremental transformation. William Farrer himself was clearly aware of this fact, as this article shows, he placed as much importance on maintaining the fertility of the soil in which he grew wheat as on improving the wheat plant itself. This article first provides some background to Farrer and on his interests in Genotype x Environment x Management (G x E x M) interactions (though he certainly did not use that terminology). It then describes some examples from my own research teams, to demonstrate the ongoing impact that arises from research to capture synergies from new genetics and improved management in the pursuit of incremental transformation.

J	Chen, J; Yin, S; Yang, XJ				Chen, Jia; Yin, Sha; Yang, Xinjun			The impact of adaptive management on community resilience in arid rural areas facing environmental change: An integrated analytical framework	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY												Environmental variability poses a major risk to rural communities and farmers, particularly in dryland regions. Effective adaptive strategies must be implemented to promote the transformation, adaptation, and sustainable development of rural areas located in arid regions worldwide. The adaptive management of rural transformation can influence community resilience by changing the elemental structures of social-ecological systems. However, few studies have reported an assessment framework between system resilience and adaptive management. We developed an integrated analytical framework to fully estimate the impact of adaptation strategy implementation on different levels of community resilience, considering the differences between spatial geographic units and measuring changes in different temporal scales. We applied this framework to a case study of China's Minqin Oasis, assessing the community resilience of rural areas facing environmental change. We found that (1) rural community resilience in Minqin Oasis has obvious spatial and temporal evolution characteristics, with the overall rural community resilience showing a decreasing trend over the past 30 years, while the spatial distribution of community resilience tended to be balanced for the period 2011-2017; (2) the main obstacles to the improvement of rural community resilience include wind and sand control, ecological water resources, economic levels, and the adjustment of the agricultural economic structure; and (3) Adaptation strategies based on the priority of ecological restoration and government-led mandatory policy are not conducive to the improvement of community resilience. This study provides a clear framework for linking adaptive management and community resilience assessment in the context of climate change or environmental risk. It also offers an effective means for policymakers to direct strategic resources to the geographic spaces where they are most required. Case-based research results provide an evaluation reference for the adaptive management of arid rural areas in the face of environmental change worldwide.																			1462-9011	1873-6416				DEC	2023	150								103589	10.1016/j.envsci.2023.103589	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2023.103589													WOS:001095508000001

However, appropriate crop management practices under limited water supply are still poorly documented. Quinoa, like other cultivated crops, needs optimum quantities of nutrients, especially nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), for better growth and high grain yield. To determine the adequate levels of nutrient requirements and their effect on quinoa growth and productivity, a field experiment was conducted during two growing seasons (2020-2021 and 2021-2022). The experiment was conducted in Ben Guerir region, north-central Morocco, and consisted of a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. The treatments studied consist of a combination of four N rates (0, 40, 80, and 120 kg ha(-1)), three P rates (0, 30, and 60 kg P2O5 ha(-1)), and three K rates (0, 60, and 120 kg K2O ha(-1)). The physiological, nutritional, and production parameters of quinoa were collected and analyzed. The results showed that the highest total biomass (3.9 t ha(-1)) and grain yield (0.8 t ha(-1)) under semi-arid conditions were obtained with 40 kg N ha(-1), 60 kg P2O5 ha(-1), and 120 kg K2O ha(-1). The application of 40-60-120 kg ha(-1) of N-P2O5-K2O increased plant height by 44%, chlorophyll content index by 96%, total biomass by 134%, grain yield by 112%, and seed weight by 118%. Among the three macronutrients, N was the most limiting factor, followed by K and P. Nutrients uptake data showed that quinoa needs 60 kg N, 26 kg P2O5, and 205 kg K2O to produce 1 t of grain yield. Our field results provide future recommendations for improving the agronomic and environmental sustainability of quinoa cultivation in dryland areas in Morocco.

Where can managers effectively resist climate-driven ecological transformation in pinyon-juniper woodlands of the US Southwest?	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Pinyon-juniper (PJ) woodlands are an important component of dryland ecosystems across the US West and are potentially susceptible to ecological transformation. However, predicting woodland futures is complicated by species-specific strategies for persisting and reproducing under drought conditions, uncertainty in future climate, and limitations to inferring demographic rates from forest inventory data. Here, we leverage new demographic models to quantify how climate change is expected to alter population demographics in five PJ tree species in the US West and place our results in the context of a climate adaptation framework to resist, accept, or direct ecological transformation. Two of five study species, Pinus edulis and Juniperus monosperma, are projected to experience population declines, driven by both rising mortality and decreasing recruitment rates. These declines are reasonably consistent across various climate futures, and the magnitude of uncertainty in population growth due to future climate is less than uncertainty due to how demographic rates will respond to changing climate. We assess the effectiveness of management to reduce tree density and mitigate competition, and use the results to classify southwest woodlands into areas where transformation is (a) unlikely and can be passively resisted, (b) likely but may be resisted by active management, and (c) likely unavoidable, requiring managers to accept or direct the trajectory. Population declines are projected to promote ecological transformation in the warmer and drier PJ communities of the southwest, encompassing 37.1%-81.1% of our sites, depending on future climate scenarios. Less than 20% of sites expected to transform away from PJ have potential to retain existing tree composition by density reduction. Our results inform where this adaptation strategy could successfully resist ecological transformation in coming decades and allow for a portfolio design approach across the geographic range of PJ woodlands.

Towards an understanding of future range shifts in lichens and mosses under climate change	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												AimLichens and mosses play important functional roles in all terrestrial ecosystems, particularly in tundra and drylands. As with all taxa, to maintain their current niche in a changing climate, lichens and mosses will have to migrate. However, there are no published estimates of future habitat suitability or necessary rates of migration for members of these groups at the global scale. TaxonLichens and mosses. LocationGlobal. MethodsUsing global occurrence data, we conducted ensemble distribution models in the 'biomod2' R package, parameterised with a range of climatic, land use and soil variables, to estimate current and future (2100) habitat suitability in 16 abundant species of lichen and moss. ResultsWithout considering dispersal limitation, suitable area was forecast to expand for eight species and decline for four species. For species with predominantly boreo-arctic distributions, suitable area typically declined at the temperate range edge and expanded across the High Arctic. Future suitable area available to dryland-adapted species generally declined overall, likely relating to the desiccation-tolerant physiology of lichens and mosses. The average migration rates required for species to disperse into new suitable habitat ranged from 1.7 (Placidium squamulosum) to 9.0 km year(-1) (Syntrichia ruralis), although most species will need to migrate >16 km year(-1) to completely fill their potential future suitable habitat. Main ConclusionsFor mosses and lichens, as with all species, migration will be an important part of the adjustment to a warmer climate, but realisation of these potential migrations will require both rare dispersal events and habitat that is suitable in non-climatic dimensions. Current evidence on dispersal in these groups suggests that these geographical shifts may be unlikely to be realised without intervention, especially in landscapes that are highly modified by humans.

The paper uses data from the field survey of 1,120 farmers in Hubei in 2018 and uses the Endogenous Transformation Regression Model (ESR) and generalized propensity score matching (GPSM) model to construct a counterfactual framework. The paper analyses the effect of multiple cropping on farmers' relative poverty and examines its mechanism. The result shows that: Multiple cropping of farmland can reduce the relative poverty of farmers through the mechanism of yield improvement path and factor intensification path. Under the counterfactual hypothesis, the relative poverty of farmers would increase by 28.43% if the farmers who participated in the multiple cropping did not; and that the relative poverty of the farmers would decrease by 29.57% if the farmers who did not participate in the multiple cropping participated. From the perspective of multiple cropping, the poverty reduction effect of multiple cropping in paddy fields is higher than that of dry land. From the perspective of the degree of multiple cropping, the poverty reduction effects of paddy fields and dryland will experience an increasing return to scale as the multiple cropping index increases. When the household equivalent scale adjustment coefficient is not used to eliminate the impact of family population structure on the "family per capita comparable income," the artificially high results estimated by the model cannot truly reflect the poverty-reducing effect of multi-cropping of farmland. This paper argues that the government can guide farmers to choose the suitable mode of multiple cropping to reduce farmers' vulnerability to relative poverty.																			2296-701X					SEP 29	2022	10								988757	10.3389/fevo.2022.988757	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2022.988757													WOS:000867864000001

Genetic variation in wood properties of A-rotation age <i>Eucalyptus globoidea</i>	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF FORESTRY SCIENCE												Background; Eucalyptus globoidea Blakely produces ground-durable (Class 2) and stiff wood and has the potential to be grown in New Zealand to supply high-value environmentally-friendly timber for use as posts in the agricultural sector and stiff veneers for the LVL industry. The New Zealand Dryland Forests Initiative (NZDFI) has established a breeding programme for this species. The objective of this study was to identify trees with superior wood properties for commercial propagation enabling the establishment of a domestic plantation resource of ground-durable timber. Methods: The genetic variation in wood properties at mid-rotation age (8-year-old) of 141 E globoidea families was assessed for the following traits: heartwood diameter, diameter under bark at similar to 0.5 m height, combined sapwood diameter, heartwood collapse, sapwood collapse, standing tree acoustic velocity and extractive content in the heartwood. Families were ranked and genotypes with large heartwood diameter, high extractive content and stiffness as well as low collapse were identified. Results: Heartwood diameter (h(2) = 0.51) and extractive content (h(2) = 1.16) showed good heritability, which in combination with high variation are promising traits for a breeding programme. The high heritability for extractive content indicated a closer relatedness within the population than the assumption of unrelated families of half-siblings. The unfavourable correlation between the heartwood diameter and extractive content (genetic correlation (r(g)) = -0.45) indicated that a compromise is required for simultaneous improvement of both traits. Heritability estimates for heartwood collapse (h(2) = 0.30) and acoustic velocity (h(2) = 0.36) were moderate. Conclusions: Genetic selection for wood quality traits of E. globoidea is practically feasible. Superior individuals with above average performance for multiple traits were present in the breeding populations, however, this was dependent on the intended end use of the timber.

Hawaiian hoary bat responses to habitat, season, and non-native insectivore suppression	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Habitat loss and non-native species are 2 of the most important factors that influence native species persistence and behaviors globally. The insectivorous Hawaiian hoary bat (Lasiurus semotus) is the only extant terrestrial mammal native to the Hawaiian Islands. Non-native invasive insectivore species, which are potential competitors of bats for prey, may influence hoary bat behavior. The goal of this study was to determine how small-scale suppression of invasive insectivores (rodents, ants, and yellowjacket wasps [Vespula pensylvanica]) influenced bat activity in grasslands and woodlands. We measured bat activity as a function of the number of distinct minutes in a night containing bat echolocations (bat call minutes) at 20 experimental plots (each 2.25 ha) in a dryland ecosystem on HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai Island, November 2016-January 2018. We included 3 predictor variables: vegetation type (woodland, grassland), season (bat reproductive cycle periods: lactation, mating, pre-pregnancy, and pregnancy), and insectivore treatment type (ant suppressed, yellowjacket wasp suppressed, rodent suppressed, combined ant+wasp+rodent suppressed, and no treatment). Bat activity was associated with all 3 predictors using a negative binomial generalized linear model. Bat call minutes and feeding buzzes were twice as high in woodlands than in the grasslands (2.4 and 2.3 times as high, respectively). Bat activity was slightly lower (0.47 bat call min/night fewer) in plots receiving the combined ant + wasp + rodent treatment compared to all other treatment plots. Feeding buzzes did not differ significantly among treatments. Mean activity was lowest during lactation (mid-Jun-Aug). Although woodlands appear particularly important for the Hawaiian hoary bat, small-scale bat activity and foraging do not appear to be strongly affected by resource competition with the invasive insectivores in this study.																			0022-541X	1937-2817				FEB	2022	86	2								10.1002/jwmg.22164	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.22164		JAN 2022											WOS:000739910400001

In order to significantly reduce irrigation rate applied to fields, an 8-year (2012-2020) in-situ field experiment that RFRH combined with supplemental irrigation (RI) of winter wheat was conducted in the semiarid region of Northwest China. Border irrigation (BI) was used as the control. Under RI and BI, irrigation was applied only once (jointing-heading stage) or twice (jointing-heading and head-ing-flowering stage) in separate trials. Irrigation rates applied each time under RI and BI were 37.5 mm (50% of that under BI) and 75.0 mm, respectively. The results indicated that compared with BI, RI significantly increased the soil water storage in the early growth stage, net photosynthetic rate, water use efficiency (WUE), and irri-gation water use efficiency, and decreased the evapotranspiration in years with different precipitation distri-butions. When irrigation was applied once, RI increased WUE by 13.4%, 9.1%, and 8.7% compared with BI in dry, normal, and wet years, respectively. When irrigation was applied twice, RI increased WUE by 12.6%, 8.9%, and 5.1% compared with BI in dry, normal, and wet years, respectively. Compared with BI, RI required 50% less irrigation water but it increased the grain yield by 3.3%, 2.4%, and 2.8% with once application in dry, normal, and wet years, respectively, and decreased it by 6.3%, 4.1%, and 3.2% when applied twice (P > 0.05). RI effectively maintained the yield and there was no significant difference compared with the yield under BI. Therefore, RI could be applied as a technique for significantly reducing irrigation rate consumed in semiarid and semi-humid areas.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				JAN 1	2022	259								107239	10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107239	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107239		OCT 2021											WOS:000711647100003

Surprising responses of a semiarid grassland to increasing deluge size	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Climate change has intensified the hydrologic cycle globally, increasing the magnitude and frequency of large precipitation events, or deluges. Dryland ecosystems are expected to be particularly responsive to increases in deluge size, as their ecological processes are largely dependent on distinct soil moisture pulses. To better understand how increasing deluge size will affect ecosystem function, we conducted a field experiment in a native semiarid shortgrass steppe (Colorado, USA). We quantified ecological responses to a range of deluge sizes, from moderate to extreme, with the goal of identifying response patterns and thresholds beyond which ecological processes would not increase further (saturate). Using a replicated regression approach, we imposed single deluges that ranged in size from 20 to 120 mm (82.3rd to >99.9th percentile of historical event size) on undisturbed grassland plots. We quantified pre- and postdeluge responses in soil moisture, soil respiration, and canopy greenness, as well as leaf water potential, growth, and flowering of the dominant grass species (Bouteloua gracilis). We also measured end of season above- and belowground net primary production (ANPP, BNPP). As expected, this water-limited ecosystem responded strongly to the applied deluges, but surprisingly, most variables increased linearly with deluge size. We found little evidence for response thresholds within the range of deluge sizes imposed, at least during this dry year. Instead, response patterns reflected the linear increase in the duration of elevated soil moisture (2-22 days) with increasing event size. Flowering of B. gracilis and soil respiration responded particularly strongly to deluge size (14- and 4-fold increases, respectively), as did ANPP and BNPP (similar to 60% increase for both). Overall, our results suggest that this semiarid grassland will respond positively and linearly to predicted increases in deluge size, and that event sizes may need to exceed historical magnitudes, or occur during wet years, before responses saturate.

Global sensitivity analysis	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE												Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) is useful for evaluating the responsiveness of agroecosystem models to input parameter adjustments. Evaluations of model sensitivity for diverse water status conditions and evapotranspiration (ET) algorithms will facilitate better use of models to provide water management recommendations. The objective of this study was to conduct a GSA to identify influential parameters in the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) Cropping System Model (CSM), specifically using the CROPGRO-Cotton module with data from cotton field studies conducted in 2000, 2001, and 2008 at Bushland, Texas. The field studies tested fully-irrigated, deficit-irrigated, and dryland cotton production in a semi-arid environment. Using high performance computing resources, a GSA was conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of 24 model outputs with respect to 37 model input parameters. The GSA was conducted for six different ET methodologies available in the model. With first-order sensitivity indices <0.05, nearly half of the tested input parameters did not influence any model output for any of the tested simulation scenarios. Among the parameters with first-order sensitivity indices >0.05, eleven were cultivar parameters that controlled crop development and growth, and five were soil parameters that specified initial soil water conditions, soil water limits, drainage rate, and root growth characteristics. The influences of another soil parameter and one ET parameter were relevant only for the ET methods that required them. Large differences in sensitivity indices were found based on the choice between two soil water evaporation methods. In addition to providing insights for other applications of this model, the results specifically informed further efforts to evaluate the model using measured data from the Bushland cotton studies to compare performance among the six ET methods, as reported in a companion paper.

Plastic-covered ridge and furrow planting has been widely applied in dryland farming, as it markedly increases precipitation productivity and crop yields. However, whether this planting system can significantly increase irrigation water productivity and whether it can reduce the irrigation volume for high-yielding wheat production in irrigated regions of the Loess Plateau are unclear. In the present study, plastic-covered ridge and furrow planting and traditional flatbed planting were performed at four irrigation levels. The objective was to investigate whether applying plastic-covered ridge and furrow planting to an irrigated farmland system could reduce the irrigation water requirements and increase water productivity for high-yielding wheat production. The results suggested that plastic-covered ridge and furrow planting significantly increased soil moisture content and increased both grain yield and water productivity of wheat. At the 0, 400, 1200, and 2000 m(3) ha(-1) irrigation levels, compared with that resulting from traditional flatbed planting, the grain yield resulting from plastic-covered ridge and furrow planting was 51.7 %, 64.8 %, 25.5 %, and 5.84 % greater, respectively. At the high-grain-yield level (6-7 t ha(-1)), the plastic-covered ridge and furrow planting system at 1200 m(3) ha(-1) irrigation conserved 40 % of irrigation water during wheat production. And it coordinated the relationships among grain yield, quality, water protuctivity and for wheat production. These findings show that the plastic-covered ridge and furrow planting system with 1200 m(3) ha(-1) irrigation is suitable for sustainable high-yielding wheat production in the irrigated regions of the Loess Plateau of China.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				MAR 31	2020	231								105935	10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105935	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105935													WOS:000525285400001
J	Obour, AK; Holman, JD; Assefa, Y				Obour, Augustine K.; Holman, Johnathan D.; Assefa, Yared			Continuous no-tillage winter wheat response to nitrogen fertilizer by yield environment	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Maintaining crop residue through no-tillage (NT) has allowed increased water storage and continuous cropping in dryland wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-based systems. However, there is little information regarding nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates for a continuous NT wheat cropping system across various yield environments. The main objective of this study was to determine agronomic optimum N rates for a continuous NT wheat in different yield environments. The study was conducted from 1981 through 2003 at the Kansas State University Agricultural Research Center near Hays, with six N fertilizer rate treatments (0, 22, 45, 67, 90, and 112 kg N ha-1). Experimental years were divided into four yield environments: very low yielding (VLY), low yielding (LY), high yielding (HY), and very high yielding (VHY). Results showed that LY environments required a relatively greater N amount (79-98 kg N ha-1) than HY to VHY environments (72-73 kg N ha-1) to attain optimal yields. The optimal yields at low-yield environments were smaller (1184-1654 kg ha-1) than in high-yield environments (2181-2733 kg ha-1). Protein yield increased by 120 g for 1 kg increase in grain yield. We concluded that the optimum N fertilizer rates for continuous NT wheat ranged from 70 to 100 kg N ha-1, but these rates should be adjusted based on yield environments. Optimal N rate was greater in low-yield (79-98 kg N ha-1) than high-yield (72-73 kg N ha-1) environments.Yields at optimal N rate for low-yield (1184-1654 kg ha-1) were less than high-yield (2181-2733 kg ha-1) environments.Protein yield increased by 120 g for 1 kg increase in grain yield.No-tillage N rates should be adjusted based on yield environments.

The results showed that the dissipation rate of OCPs in contaminated soils with initial concentrations of 122.24 mu g/kg was 89.94% after the addition of 25 mg of immobilized microbial agents at the end of the 90 days of experiment, which was 6.1% higher than that of the compound microbial agents under the same environmental conditions, and the control group without the addition of microbial agents was only 1.18%, while the concentration of OCPs in contaminated soils with initial concentrations of 203.64 mu g/kg only decreased to 65.29 mu g/kg after the addition of 20 mg of compound microbial agents. In contrast, the soil concentration of immobilized microbial agent treatment group under the same conditions decreased to 52.15 mu g/kg. During the field experiment, the enhanced efficiency of immobilized microbial agents on the degradation of OCPs in different cultivation usage was evidently different, showed that the concentration of OCPs in paddy fields (18.60%) > tea gardens (12.17%) >= orchards (11.41%) > vegetable fields (6.21%) >= dryland (4.79%), which was especially significant in stress environment. Overall, the immobilization treatment obviously improved the degradation potential of OCPs-specific degrading microbe, and the degree of improvement was related to the metabolic activity of the degrading microbe, the addition amount, remediation time, and habitat conditions.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2023	195	11							1274	10.1007/s10661-023-11891-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11891-6								37801194					WOS:001082571900004

Jesus			Alder stands promote N-cycling but not leaf litter mass loss in Mediterranean streams flowing through pine plantations	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												During the last century, the abandonment of traditional dryland farming and pastures in the Mediterranean basin promoted the development of ambitious afforestation programs causing a drastic transformation of the land-scape. Afforestation programs were usually accomplished without considering the potential ecological impacts on the recipient ecosystems. Forest streams rely on terrestrial organic detritus, so their functioning and con-servation status can be altered by changes in riparian forest biodiversity and composition. However, the in-fluences of conifer plantations in particular on stream functioning are still unclear, possibly because the presence of multiple species in plantations or the presence of other species in the riparian zones of streams may act as buffers of such effects. Here, by means of a field experiment, we assessed whether the presence of black alder in the riparian zone and/or as leaf litter within the stream may mitigate the impacts exerted by pine plantations on stream ecosystem functioning. We found (i) that streams were functionally similar but differed in water N concentrations; (ii) no differences in litter mas loss between riparian types, but higher total litter mass loss of those mixtures containing alder leaf litter; and (iii) higher N losses (or lower N gains) for all litter types in streams without riparian alder. These results demonstrate that microbial decomposers can use either stream water N or litter N, and that detritivores can feed simultaneously on resources of contrasting quality to balance their diet. Our study underscores the effect of even low-density riparian cover of alder promoting microbial nutrient cycling by moderate increases of water N concentrations. We suggest thinning of pine plantations combined with planting of native deciduous species as alder to alleviate the effects of pine plantations on Mediterranean streams.

H.			Contrasting relationships between plant-soil microbial diversity are driven by geographic and experimental precipitation changes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Soil microbe diversity plays a key role in dryland ecosystem function under global climate change, yet little is known about how plant-soil microbe relationships respond to climate change. Altered precipitation patterns strongly shape plant community composition in deserts and steppes, but little research has demonstrated whether plant biodiversity attributes mediate the response of soil microbial diversity to long-and short-term precipitation changes. Here we used a comparative study to explore how altered precipitation along the natural and experimental gradients affected asso-ciations of soil bacterial and fungal diversity with plant biodiversity attributes (species, functional and phylogenetic diversity) and soil properties in desert-shrub and steppe-grass communities. We found that along both gradients, in-creasing precipitation increased soil bacterial and fungal richness in the desert and soil fungal richness in the steppe. Soil bacterial richness in the steppe was also increased by increasing precipitation in the experiment but was decreased along the natural gradient. Plant biodiversity and soil properties explained the variations in soil bacterial and fungal richness from 43 % to 96 % along the natural gradient and from 19 to 46 % in the experiment. Overall, precipitation effects on soil bacterial or fungal richness were mediated by plant biodiversity attributes (species richness and plant height) or soil properties (soil water content) along the natural gradient but were mediated by plant biodiversity attri-butes (functional or phylogenetic diversity) in the experiment. These results suggest that different mechanisms are re-sponsible for the responses of soil bacterial and fungal diversity to long-and short-term precipitation changes. Long- and short-term precipitation changes may modify plant biodiversity attribute effects on soil microbial diversity in de-serts and steppes, highlighting the importance of precipitation changes in shaping relationships between plant and soil microbial diversity in water-limited areas.					zhao, lin/JJF-0406-2023; Li, Wen/JQI-4757-2023; WANG, Bin/JGM-2639-2023; Li, Yan/JRW-0176-2023; Wang, yl/JNR-4963-2023; Wang, Jing/JRW-1512-2023; wang, yu/IUQ-6654-2023; Han, Jian/ABZ-1060-2022; YI, J/JJE-7713-2023; zhang, ying/JQX-1479-2023; yuanyuan, Li/JEZ-6497-2023; zheng, yan/JKJ-3632-2023; wang, xiaoxuan/JMP-6531-2023; guo, xinxin/JKI-1337-2023; Wang, Xuechun/JRX-6509-2023; Zhang, Yunyi/JHS-3626-2023; LI, SHA/JNR-9956-2023; li, yifan/JHU-9272-2023; Hu, Weigang/CAH-3530-2022; Zhou, Yue/JHS-8791-2023; Liu, Jie/JCP-1070-2023; zhao, yan/JNT-6961-2023; zhang, xiao/JCN-8822-2023; LI, WEI/JUE-9796-2023; yang, xiao/JLL-7721-2023; Yang, Lili/JTT-5215-2023	Han, Jian/0000-0002-0647-4050; Hu, Weigang/0000-0003-1422-3726; Yang, Lili/0009-0008-2926-484X													0048-9697	1879-1026				FEB 25	2023	861								160654	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160654	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160654								36473666					WOS:000992199700001

Thus, an alternative technology based on inoculating biocrust-forming cyanobacteria on degraded soils has emerged. Biocrusts are communities of mosses, lichens, cyanobacteria or fungi that colonize soil surface forming a stable and fertile layer. Previous studies have shown the benefits of inoculating cyanobacteria to restore soils at a small scale. However, to face field restoration projects, it is necessary to produce high quantities of biomass at an affordable cost. In this work, we analyze if the previously tested cyanobacteria Scytonema hyalinum, Tolypothrix distorta (heterocystous strains) and Trichocoleus desertorum (a bundle-forming one) can be produced with agricultural fertilizers. Different culture media were used: two containing pure chemicals (BG11 and BG110, this N-free medium was used just for heterocystous strains) and two containing fertilizers (BG11-F and MM-F). The performance of the cul-tures was monitored by measuring the biomass concentration and photosynthetic stress. Afterwards, we analyzed their capacity to induce biocrusts and improve soil properties by inoculating the biomass on a mine substrate indoors and measuring, three months later, the albedo, chlorophyll a and organic carbon content. Results show that the bundle -forming cyanobacterium was unable to grow in the media tested, whereas both heterocystous cyanobacteria grew in all of them and induced the formation of biocrusts improving the organic carbon substrate content. The best results for S. hyalinum were found using the MM-F medium, and for T. distorta using a medium containing pure chemicals (BG11). However, results were also positive when using a medium containing fertilizers (BG11-F). Thus, agricultural fertilizers can be used to undertake the production of heterocystous cyanobacteria for large scale restoration in drylands. On the other hand, more research is needed to find sustainable techniques to produce biomass of bundle -forming cyanobacteria.

Weed species occurrence, abundance, and densities differ due to spatial soil fertility variability, and management practices by farmers. Weed surveys are therefore vital for tracking such changes and in turn developing appropriate weed management strategies for farmers. A weed survey was carried out in Wedza, eastern Zimbabwe to assess farmer knowledge and perceptions of major weeds in maize fields across catena landscape positions. A multistage sampling procedure was used, involving random sampling of six villages within a 20 km radius, divided according to the catena position and economic status of the farmer. Two hundred and forty-nine (249) households were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. The data were coded and processed using the CSPro software package, and then analysed using the SPSS program. Factors that predicted the spatial distribution of weeds were determined using a binary logistic model. From the survey, 52.8% and 42.3% of farms are on the upper catena and lower catena, respectively, and only 4.8% are on the middle catena. Thirty-one weed species belonging to 15 families were listed by respondents and identified by enumerators in the study area and were categorised into three main groups (broadleaf, grasses, and sedges). Acanthospermum hispidum and Striga asiatica were considered as problem weeds in maize fields on the upper and lower catena, respectively. Xanthium strumarium was perceived as a new invasive weed in low-lying arable fields. The binary logistic model predicted farm location on the landscape and fertiliser use as the main factors affecting weed types, distribution, and abundance. Moreover, farms on lower catena had more Striga infestations compared to upper catena. The results suggested an integrated weed management approach to control A. hispidum, Striga species, and the invasive fast-spreading X. strumarium in the area.

Characterising biocrust microbial communities is an important step in understanding their functional traits. Our aims were to explore the composition, diversity, and ecological function of the microbial community in two types of biocrusts in the Mu Us Sandland, China. High-throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) and Functional Annotation of Prokaryotic Taxa (FAPROTAX) were used to analyze the soil bacterial and fungal communities in two types of biocrusts and their potential functions. In our study we showed that the richness and diversity of bacterial and fungal communities was significantly different between the lichen and moss biocrusts based on high-throughput sequencing. Dominant bacteria in lichen biocrusts (68.0%) were Actinomycetes, Cyanobacteria, and Proteobacteria, with 59.9% in moss biocrusts. In lichen crusts the dominant phylum of fungi was mainly Ascomycota. Microcoleus (11.1%) and Exophiala (7.4%) lichen crusts, while the dominant genus in moss crusts was RB41 (5.2%). The top three factors that were correlated with both bacterial and fungal community structures were pH, soil dissolved organic carbon, and soil organic carbon. Further analysis by FAPROTAX corroborated that the function of the bacterial community in two types of biocrusts was quite different. The relative abundances of metabolic functions in moss crusts, such as chemoheterotrophy, ureolysis, aromatic compound degradation, and nitrate reduction, were significantly higher than those in lichen crusts, however, the relative abundances of cyanobacteria, oxygenic photoautotrophy, photoautotrophy, and phototrophy were significantly lower (P < 0.05). Together, our results showed that the taxonomic and metabolic diversity, including specific species, have significant effects on the biocrusts types and their functional traits. This study provides a theoretical basis for elements of the soil microbiome restoration that may influence the establishment of plant communities.					sun, chen/JCP-0396-2023; Lin, Yanbin/AAR-3522-2021; 王, 春/HVI-8880-2023														1574-9541	1878-0512				DEC	2021	66								101441	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.101441	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.101441		OCT 2021											WOS:000710485400010

Merr] in lieu of summer fallow could provide nutritious summer forage for livestock, reduce requirements for inorganic N fertilizer for winter wheat, and ameliorate sustainability issues associated with summer fallow, such as soil erosion and low precipitation use efficiency (PUE). This modeling study utilized DSSAT-CSM to assess: the yield and water use of three cultivars of forage soybean of diverse maturity groups (MGs) harvested at three different dates [60, 90, and 120 days after planting (DAP)]; and their influence on performance and water productivity of subsequent winter wheat, and overall double-cropping systems in comparison to the fallow-wheat system. Crop yield and evapotranspiration (ET) data, collected from continuous field experiments at El Reno, Oklahoma (35.57 degrees N, 98.03 degrees W) during 2002-2006, were used for calibration and validation of soybean and wheat models. Long-term simulations conducted using historical weather data (1994-2019) suggested that mid-maturity group (MGV) soybean could provide greater forage yields and higher water use efficiency (WUEB) than later-maturing soybeans (MGVI & MGVII) when harvested at 90-120 days after planting (DAP). Double-cropping forage soybean and winter wheat caused a reduction of 1.4-2.1 Mg ha(-1) grain and 4.7-5.6 Mg ha(-1) and biomass by wheat, and higher seasonal ET losses of 77-132 mm than the fallow-wheat system. However, trade-offs in yields between forage soybean and winter wheat were effective when precipitation was >180 mm during the first 60 d of growth by soybean. Despite yield losses in winter wheat, double-cropped forage soybean-wheat systems could be a viable option based on its economic competitiveness and other ecological benefits.																			0378-4290	1872-6852				MAY 15	2021	265								108086	10.1016/j.fcr.2021.108086	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2021.108086		MAR 2021											WOS:000637747500004

For this purpose, we conducted a density-dependent yield-formation experiment in field-grown wheat with flat-planting (CK) and ridge-furrow with plastic-film mulch (RFM). The results indicated that increased population densities (i.e. seed rates of 60, 140, 220, 300, 380 and 460 kg ha(-1)) decreased the reproductive allocation at the individual level under both farming systems, but the maximum wheat yield was observed at medium densities (300 -380 kg ha(-1)). While there exists a selective conflict between individual survival and population yield, our experiments in dryland wheat showed that a moderate reproductive allocation at the level of the individual achieved better yield performance at the population level. However, the principal component analyses (PCA) showed that optimal individual and population performances were achieved synchronously at 220 kg ha(-1) under RFM treatment. We employed the law of constant final yield (CFY) to interpret the biomass-density relationships in the two farming systems. While the population grain yield started to decline from the peak values at medium density, total biomass continued to increase with density and then leveled off at 300, 380 and 460 kg ha(-1). Critically, the decrease in yield occurred at higher plant densities in the RFM system. Allometric relationships further showed that the RFM treatment led to significantly higher reproductive allocation than the CK treatment at the individual plant level. This is the first report supporting that the theory that reproductive allometry can be applied to interpret the tradeoff between population productivity and individual performance, and the mechanisms of yield-improvement of the RFM system.

J	Johnston, DB; Garbowski, M				Johnston, Danielle B.; Garbowski, Magda			Responses of Native Plants and Downy Brome to a Water-Conserving Soil Amendment	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Restoring native plants in rangelands threatened by downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.) presents a serious challenge to land managers. Higher, more consistent soil moisture, as well as slightly compacted soils, may reduce the competitive abilities of downy brome. We manipulated these factors with three treatments: superabsorbent polymer (SAP), a soil-binding agent, and roller compaction at two restoration sites, Wagon Road Ridge (WRR) and Sagebrush (SGE), in northwestern Colorado. SAPs absorb water when soils are wet and then gradually release it, often reducing plant water stress. The binding agent we used is purported to increase water infiltration while reducing soil movement. In Experiment 1, we crossed an SAP, a binding agent, and rolling and found that SAP benefitted perennial grass establishment at the WRR site only. SAP also decreased downy brome cover and biomass at WRR. The binding agent increased soil moisture at both sites, and the highest level of binding agent reduced downy brome cover in the absence of SAP at the SGE site. In Experiment 2, we examined only SAP, with larger plots and a more complex seed mix. Again, SAP benefitted perennial grass establishment at WRR only. SAP reduced initial perennial forb density at both sites but did not affect forb cover in subsequent years. SAP effects on downy brome were site-specific. There was a trend for reduced downy brome cover with SAP at WRR, but SAP caused a large increase in downy brome cover in yr 3 at SGE. Granulated SAP can be applied easily along with drill seeding, making it potentially applicable for dryland restoration. However, site specific factors may influence whether perennial grasses or downy brome most benefit from SAP application. (C) 2019 Colorado Parks and Wildlife.

To investigate the effects of fertilization, tillage, and their interaction on crop yield, WUE, and soil water content dynamics, a split-plot experiment {with conventional fertilization (255 kg N, 180 kg P2O5 ha(-1)), recommended fertilization (150 kg N, 120 kg P2O5, and 90 kg K2O ha(-1)), and low fertilization rate (75 kg N, 60 kg P2O5, and 45 kg K2O ha(-1)) as main plots; and conventional tillage (CT), no till (NT), and subsoiling tillage (ST) as subplots} was conducted on a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) system in the Loess Plateau from 2007 to 2017. We hypothesized that reasonable fertilization and tillage combinations can facilitate soil water storage and use, as well as crop yield improvement. Compared to conventional fertilization x CT, NT and ST improved average grain yield and water use efficiency (by 9.4% and 4.1%, and 14.4% and 9.2%, respectively) when combined with recommended fertilization, but reduced them when combined with low fertilization rate. NT and ST were more beneficial in the dry and wet seasons, respectively. The average soil water storage through fallow significantly improved by 28 mm and 15.9 mm under NT and ST, respectively, and the improvement was more significant under recommended fertilization and/or in dry fallows. From the tillering to grain filling stages, the average soil water content reduction in the 0-200 cm profile under recommended fertilization x ST was 16.4% greater than that under low fertilization x CT, and this increased water use was significantly correlated with the yield improvement. These results demonstrated that reasonable fertilization can facilitate the transformation of soil water benefit under conservation tillage to crop yield improvement.

Minimising soil organic carbon erosion by wind is critical for land degradation neutrality	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY												The Land Degradation-Neutrality (LDN) framework of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) is underpinned by three complementary interactive indicators (metrics: vegetation cover, net primary productivity; NPP and soil organic carbon; SOC) as proxies for change in land-based natural capital. The LDN framework assumes that SOC changes slowly, primarily by decomposition and respiration of CO2 to the atmosphere. However, there is growing evidence that soil erosion by wind, water and tillage also reduces SOC stocks rapidly after land use and cover change. Here, we modify a physically-based wind erosion sediment transport model to better represent the vegetation cover (using land surface aerodynamic roughness; that is the plant canopy coverage, stone cover, soil aggregates, etc. that protects the soil surface from wind erosion) and quantify the contribution of wind erosion to global SOC erosion (2001-2016). We use the wind erosion model to identify global dryland regions where SOC erosion by wind may be a significant problem for achieving LDN. Selected sites in global drylands also show SOC erosion by wind accelerating over time. Without targeting and reducing SOC erosion, management practices in these regions will fail to sequester SOC and reduce land degradation. We describe the interrelated nature of the LDN indicators, the importance of including SOC erosion by wind erosion and how by explicitly accounting for wind erosion processes, we can better represent the physical effects of changing land cover on land degradation. Our results for Earth's drylands show that modelling SOC stock reduction by wind erosion is better than using land cover and SOC independently. Furthermore, emphasising the role of wind erosion in UNCCD and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reporting will better support LDN and climate change mitigation and adaptation globally.

However, these variables, if simultaneously employed, may induce multicollinearity problems because of their potential interactions. Further, these interactions may vary with different time scales and subsequently result in the inaccurate estimation of to omega. As such, we investigated the interactions of vegetation, climate and topography and their corresponding effects on ET modelling at different time scales by employing vegetation coverage (M), an improved climate seasonality and asynchrony index (SAI), the fraction of precipitation falling as snow (f(s)) and relative basin relief (BR/(B) over barR), in 30 catchments in China's Loess Plateau. We found that, on annual scale, M and SAI were significantly related to omega, while being independent from each other; in consequence, both of them should be parameterized into the Budyko model on the annual scale for better ET modelling. However, the links between M and SAI became stronger with increased time scales, the parameterization of omega should thus be reformatted for longer periods. When extended to a 30-year period, omega was closely related to the above variables, but M was highly inter correlated with SAI and BR/(B) over barR, and f(s) was significantly related to BR/(B) over barR. The independent M and f(s) were finally selected to fit omega, which allowed mean annual ET to be accurately modelled on long-term scale. Identification of the dominant factors applicable at different time scales can simplify the empirical parameterization of the Budyko formula and thereby facilitate more accurate estimation of ET.

However, the effects of polyurethane (PU) controlled-release fertiliser coated MPs (PU MPs), which widely exist in rice systems, coupled with Cd on plant growth and Cd accumulation under flooding conditions are still unknown. Therefore, in the present study, in situ techniques were used to systematically study the effects of PU MPs and Cd coupling on the physiological and biochemical performance, metabolomics characteristics, rhizosphere bacterial community, and Cd bioavailability of rice in different soil types (red soil/cinnamon soil). The results showed that the effects of PU MPs on rice growth and Cd accumulation were concentration-dependent, especially in red soil. High PU concentration (1 %) inhibited rice root growth significantly (44 %). The addition of PU MPs inhibited photosynthetically active radiation, net photosynthesis, and transpiration rate of rice, mainly with low concentration (0.1 %) in red soil and high concentration (1 %) in cinnamon soil. PU MPs can enhance the expression of Cd resistance genes (cadC and copA) in soil, enhance the mobility of Cd, and affect the metabolic pathways of metabolites in the rhizosphere soil (red soil: fatty acid metabolism; cinnamon soil: amino acid degradation, heterobiodegradation, and nucleotide metabolism) to promote Cd absorption in rice. Especially in red soil, Cd accumulation in the root and aboveground parts of rice after the addition of high concentration PU (1 %) was 1.7 times and 1.3 times, respectively, that of the control (p < 0.05). Simultaneously, microorganisms can affect rice growth and Cd bioavailability by affecting functional bacteria related to carbon, iron, sulfur, and manganese.

It is expected that the risk of natural disasters related to excess or lack of water (flash floods and severe droughts) will continue increasing in the region until the end of the century. In this work, we study multifractal properties of the Standardized precipitation index (SPI) which is commonly used to evaluate the degree of severity of drought and humid conditions at different time scales and can be compared among regions with distinct climatic conditions. The method Multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) is used to analyze SPI for 1, 3, 6, and 12-month accumulation periods at 133 locations across the state of Pernambuco, with climate varying from tropical humid in the coastal area to semiarid in the deep inland region. The results show that all SPI series (independently of time scale and climatic conditions) display multifractal dynamics, which can be described by properties of the multifractal spectrum. It was found that SPI series exhibit long-term persistence and multifractality that becomes stronger as accumulation time increases. For all temporal scales, the values of Hurst exponent increase in the west-east direction indicating stronger persistence of dry/wet conditions in the coastal region Zona da Mata, with a tropical humid climate, than in the dry semiarid inland Serta & SIM;o region. For SPI-1, SPI-3, and SPI-6 which describe short and medium conditions the width of the multifractal spectrum (degree of multifractality) doesn't vary across the studied area, while for SPI-12 which describes long-term conditions the width of the multifractal spectrum decreases in a west-east direction, indicating stronger multifractality and higher complexity in long duration precipitation anomalies in the semiarid Serta & SIM;o region.

Soil health responses of circular grass buffer strips in center-pivot irrigated agriculture	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Decline in water table in the Ogallala Aquifer, along with soil degradation, has threatened the sustainability of agriculture in the US High Plains region. Circular grass buffers in center pivot irrigated cropping systems could support sustainable crop production by providing multiple ecosystem services. This study evaluated soil organic matter (SOM), nutrients, and other selected soil health indicators under circular buffer strip grasses (BSG), adjacent buffer strip corn (Zea mays L.) (BSC), and continuous conventional corn (CCC) in the 0-80 cm soil profile. Soil samples were collected from the center of corn and grass strips for 5 years (2017-2021) and analyzed for nitrate N (NO3--N), soil pH, electrical conductivity, cation exchange capacity, SOM, and soil nutrients. The NO3--N under CCC in 0-20 cm (18.4 mg kg(-1)) and 60-80 cm (4.97 mg kg(-1)) were 1.56 and 1.96 times higher than BSC. The NO3--N was significantly lower under BSG than other treatments in 0-20 cm, 20-40, and 40-60 cm depths. The SOM was similar among all treatments. Response of other nutrients varied among treatments and inter-annually. Soil pH in 0-20 cm depth was 0.1 and 0.3 units lower in CCC (pH = 7.7) than in BSC and BSG. Soil electrical conductivity was 37.5% and 25% greater in CCC than BSG (0.24 and 0.24 dS m(-1)) in 0-20 and 20-40 cm depths, respectively. Grass buffer strips maintaining SOM despite no irrigation, less residual N under corn with grass buffer, and less rapid changes in soil pH suggest the potential of grass buffer to maintain soil health in semi-arid cropping systems facing the transition to dryland.

Phosphorus fertilization, use of improved or high yield potential cultivars and appropriate cropping systems could increase soybean yields. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of tillage, cultivar and P fertilization levels on P uptake and P use efficiency, as well as plant growth, yield, grain protein and oil content, in a soybean based cropping system. The study was conducted under dryland conditions at Sheepmoor, Mpumalanga. A field experiment was established in a randomized complete block design. Treatments were arranged in a 2 x 3 x 3 strip-split-plot structure. There were two tillage systems [no-till (NT) and conventional tillage (CT)], three cultivars (PAN 1614R, PAN 1521R, and PAN 1532R), and three phosphorus rates (0, 30, and 60 kg/ha). All treatment combinations were replicated three times. P uptake improved with P application, although there were no differences between 30 and 60 kg/ha whilst PFP was significantly higher at 30 kg/ha P. Yield was significantly higher at 30 kg/ha P application under NT and varied with cultivars. P application at 30 and 60 kg/ha significantly reduced oil content by 11.3 and 7.16%, respectively, but had inverse effects on protein content. The activities of acid phosphatase (ACP) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) also increased with P application. Improvement of soybean yield and its attributes, grain quality, P uptake, PFP, soil physicochemical and microbial properties emphasize the importance of fertilizer application, sustainable cropping systems coupled with careful cultivar selection. Therefore, in order to improve soil fertility and soybean yield under small farm conditions, the application of no-till and optimum application of fertilizers should be prioritized.

However, the distribution patterns of water microbes across different basal water sources are still largely unknown. This study was conducted to compare microorganisms in the water bodies of different types of water sources in the Kalamaili Mountain Ungulate Nature Reserve in China. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the undirected microbial co-existence network consisted of 15 main modules referring to different water sources, which indicated specific molecular co-existence relationships. It was found that the most dominant phyla (namely Proteobacteria, Patescibacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidota, and Actinobacteriota) of the molecular ecological network shared the same structures as the microbial community, which justified the construction of the network via a random network formation. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on Bray-Curtis distances revealed that there were still considerable variations among different habitats, showing separate sample clusters. Additionally, the different topological roles of subnetworks trimmed to a uniform size indicated different co-existence patterns in the microbiome. The artificially recharged water from concrete pond substrate (ARC) subnetworks had a relatively discrete co-occurrence, while the natural water sources (NRE) and artificially recharged water from earthen pond substrate (ARE) groups were more compact with giant modules. The NRE and ARE groups were also richer in microbial composition and had a higher number of species with low abundance. Consequently, concrete substrates may contribute to dysfunction in water microbiomes. Moreover, the functional diversity of the NRE and ARE groups is due to more intra-module connections and more inter-module connections, indirectly leading to a stable function resilient to external environmental influences. In conclusion, the microecology of the NRE was more stable than that of the concrete substrate, and artificial transportation had less effect on the microbial community.

Simulation of regional groundwater levels in arid regions using interpretable machine learning models	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Regional groundwater level forecasting is critical to water resource management, especially for arid regions which require effective management of groundwater resources to meet human and ecosystem needs. In this study Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches - Support Vector Machine, Generalized Regression Neural Network, Decision Tree, Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network, Long Short Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Networkhave been used to simulate the groundwater levels in the lower Tarim River basin (LTRB) which is an extreme dryland. The results showed that models developed here with easily available input data such as relative humidity, flow volume and distance to the riverbank can fully utilize spatiotemporally inconsistent groundwater monitoring data to predict the spatiotemporal variation of the groundwater system in arid regions where exist intermittent flow. The shapely additive explanations method was used to interpret the RF model and discover the effect of meteorological, hydrological and environmental variables on the regional groundwater. These explanations showed that the flow volume, the distance to the river channel and reservoir have a critical impact on groundwater changes. Within 300 m distance to the riverbank, groundwater would mainly be influenced by the flow volume and the distance to the reservoir. While far from the riverbank, these effects decreased gradually further away from the river course. The RF prediction results showed that in the next three years (2021-2023), the groundwater level on average may decline to -6.4 m, and the suitable areas for natural vegetation growth would be limited to 39% if no water conveyance in the LTRB. To guarantee the stability of ecosystems in the LTRB, it is necessary to convey the water annually. These results can support spatiotemporal predictions of groundwater levels predominantly recharged by intermittent flow, and form a scientific basis for sustainable water resources management in arid regions.

Frost cycling is likely to be an important contributor to the deterioration of earthen heritage, with frost damage known to cause deterioration features such as flaking and granular disintegration. However, it is not clear how important a contribution frost cycling makes in comparison with other agents. Previous earthen heritage studies have focused on other agents of deterioration, such as wind and rain, or investigated the role of freeze-thaw cycles under conditions unrepresentative of many earthen sites. We investigate how density and moisture content affect the severity of frost damage on earthen heritage using materials and conditions informed by those found at earthen sites in NW China. We prepared rammed earth cubes (5 x 5 x 5 cm) at two densities (1.65 and 1.75 g cm(-3)) and with five moisture content levels between 0.46 and 8%. Samples were subjected to 80 freeze-thaw temperature cycles (+7 to-15 degrees C) in an environmental cabinet. Deterioration was recorded using visual assessment, measurements of surface roughness, ultrasonic pulse velocities, a Vicat needle test and mass loss. Results showed frost damage was dependent on moisture content and density of rammed earth samples. Samples with <2% moisture content showed no visible frost damage. Samples with higher moisture contents (>6%) and higher densities exhibited the greatest deterioration with surface granulation, salt efflorescence and flakes detaching from the parent cubes. This suggests that frost damage to rammed earth is likely to be focused in periods when rainfall or snowmelt is followed by freeze-thaw temperature cycling. In addition, results suggest that if higher density earthen materials are used for repairs or restoration for sites in dryland environments, these could be more vulnerable to frost damage than lower density materials.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				MAY 1	2022	819								153047	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153047		JAN 2022						35032524					WOS:000766803100008

The common irrigation methods in this area are traditional flood irrigation and drip irrigation. In this study, we investigated the effects of these two irrigation methods on the fungal diversity, community structures, and functions in alfalfa rhizosphere soil as well as the associated environmental factors in northern Tianshan Mountain (Xinjiang, China). Soil enzyme activities (urease and neutral phosphatase) were significantly higher in the drip-irrigated alfalfa rhizosphere soil than in the flood-irrigated alfalfa rhizosphere soil, whereas the fungal alpha diversity in the drip-irrigated alfalfa rhizosphere soil was significantly lower than that in the flood-irrigated alfalfa rhizosphere soil. Six dominant fungal phyla were identified (>0.1%), with Ascomycota being the most abundant in all soils, followed by Basidiomycota (5.47%), Mortierellomycota (1.07%), Glomeromycota (0.55%), Rozellomycota (0.27%), and Chytridiomycota (0.14%). Ascomycota and Glomeromycota species were significantly less abundant in drip-irrigated alfalfa rhizosphere soil than in flood-irrigated alfalfa rhizosphere soil. A LEFSe analysis identified Cladosporiaceae (20.8%) species as the most abundant marker fungi in drip-irrigated alfalfa rhizosphere soil. Of the 13 fungal functional groups identified on the basis of the functional annotation using the FUNGuild database, Ectomycorrhizal (22.29%) was the primary functional group. Compared with flood irrigation, drip irrigation significantly decreased the relative abundance of Ectomycorrhizal and Arbuscular_Mycorrhizal, while increasing the relative abundance of Plant_Pathogen, although not significantly (P = 0.19). Available potassium was revealed to be the main environmental factor influencing soil enzyme activities, fungal alpha diversity, fungal community structures, and fungal functions in response to the different irrigation methods. In conclusion, drip irrigation may be more appropriate than flood irrigation in the Tianshan dryland agricultural area for enhancing soil enzyme activities, but it may also increase the abundance of plant pathogenic fungi in the soil.					feng, yuanyuan/GRO-2896-2022; wu, yong/GRX-7621-2022	wu, yong/0000-0003-1956-663X													1932-6203						2022	17	6							e0268175	10.1371/journal.pone.0268175	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268175								35714153					WOS:000843613300030

Contrasting effects of local environment and grazing pressure on the genetic diversity and structure of <i>Artemisia frigida</i>	CONSERVATION GENETICS												Drylands count among the most globally extensive biomes, and while many desert and dry rangeland ecosystems are under threat, genetic structures of dryland species are still rarely studied. Artemisia frigida is one of the most widely distributed plant species in the temperate rangelands of Eurasia and North America, and it also dominates in many habitats of Mongolia due to its tolerance to low temperatures, drought and disturbance. Local environmental conditions and grazing pressure can influence species performance and affect spatial patterns of genetic diversity in contrasting ways, and our study set out to evaluate such effects on the genetic diversity and structure of A. frigida. We first developed new species-specific Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) markers using whole genome sequencing. We then analysed 11 populations of A. frigida that had been sampled along a large climatic gradient in Mongolia, which were sub-structured according to three levels of grazing intensity. Estimates of genetic diversity at the population level were high (H-O = 0.56, H-E = 0.73) and tended to increase with higher precipitation and soil nutrient availability. Grazing had no effect on genetic diversity, however, a high number of grazing-specific indicator alleles was found at grazed sites. Genetic differentiation among populations was extremely low (global G(ST) = 0.034). Analysis of Molecular Variance revealed 5% variance between populations along the climatic gradient, with 3% of the variance being partitioned among different grazing intensity levels. We found no relationship between geographic and genetic distances, and thus no isolation by distance in this widely distributed species. The relatively low genetic structuring suggests that considerable gene flow exists among A. frigida populations across the rangelands of Mongolia, in spite of the pervasive grazing in the region.

However, most studies focus on their effects on understorey plant communities, and the relative importance of shrubs in affecting plants vs soil biota communities is poorly known. Location Inner Mongolian Steppe, China. Methods We examined the effect of shrubs on multiple community attributes, including plants, soil biota (bacteria, fungi and nematodes), and soil fertility, and quantified how these effects changed from semi-arid to hyperarid conditions (from 281 mm to 110 mm of mean annual precipitation). In addition, we assessed whether the effects of shrubs on plant communities were directly mediated by biotic filtering in seed germination and establishment, or indirectly mediated by plant biomass or soil fertility in the case of soil organisms. Results The effect of shrubs on soil biota was generally more positive than on plants, and it increased with aridity. We found that a larger proportion of below-ground taxa depended on shrub presence (36%) than plants (20%). Soil nematodes and soil bacteria were directly influenced by shrub presence whereas soil fungi were indirectly influenced by enhanced soil fertility. Shrubs also increased plant biomass under all conditions but only increased plant species richness in the most arid conditions. Despite the generally positive effect of shrubs, and the fact that they weakened the filtering effects of aridity on seed germination, aridity was a stronger predictor of changes in species composition than shrub presence was, particularly for plants. Conclusions Our results illustrate the variety of positive effects of shrubs and show that they are particularly important in supporting biodiversity in the most arid conditions. These strong and positive effects could partially buffer the impacts of increasing aridity on dryland soil biodiversity, but our study suggests that facilitative interactions may not be able to completely mitigate the impacts of increasing aridity on drylands.

However, it can lead to low wheat yields and reduced nitrogen use efficiency compared with dryland wheat (DW). We evaluated wheat yield and nitrogen use efficiency for two rotations (summer rice-winter wheat and summer soybean-winter wheat) from 2017 to 2019 and applied the results to improve nitrogen management for planting wheat after rice in the Jianghan Plain. Field experiments were conducted over two years with two nitrogen treatments: traditional nitrogen management (M1: 90 kg N ha(-1) was applied at sowing and jointing, respectively) and optimized nitrogen management (M2: 60 kg N ha(-1) was applied at sowing, wintering and jointing, respectively). The highest total wheat production was achieved under M2 for both cropping systems and the two-year average yield was 6,128 kg ha in DW and 6,166 kg ha in RW. The spike number in DW was 15% higher than RW in M1 and 13% higher in M2, but the kernel per spike and 1,000-grain weight was lower than RW. The nitrogen accumulation of DW was 24% higher than RW in M1 and 33% in M2. Compared with RW, DW had higher NO3- content in the soil surface layer (0-20 cm) and a higher root length density (RLD) in the deeper layer (40-60 cm), which may account for the higher N uptake in DW. Our results show that the grain yield of RW was comparable to that of DW by optimum nitrogen management. The rice-wheat cropping system combined with optimum nitrogen management may be of economic and agronomic benefit to the wheatbelt in the Jianghan Plain in China.

Recent studies have shown that it comprises multiple cryptic species and the nominal species is now restricted to southern Africa. Newly collected mitochondrial data (16S rRNA) helped to resolve the status of the Kenyan populations, which revealed the presence of two distant related species. Pairwise distances show average 5.87% differences between the two Kenyan species, and 3.58-5.27% and 8.62-9.15% to nominal P. wahlbergi and P. maculicollis Jacobsen & Broadley, 2000 respectively. Ablepharus massaiensis Angel, 1924 was described from the Maasai plains near Nairobi, but has long been considered a junior synonym of P. wahlbergi. We herein resurrect Panaspis massaiensis comb. nov. as a valid species and describe a new species, Panaspis tsavoensis sp. nov. from the Tsavo Conservation Area in south-eastern Kenya. Morphological examinations of specimens reveal minor differences from each other as well as nominal forms of P. wahlbergi and P. maculicollis. Panaspis massaiensis comb. nov. shares with the P. wahlbergi group a white ventrolateral stripe but can be distinguished by the presence of 26 midbody scale rows versus 24. Panaspis tsavoensis sp. nov. on the other hand, lacks the white ventrolateral stripe, most similar to the P. maculicollis group but differs in that P. maculicollis breeding males have a black patch on the neck with diagonal rows of white spots. Panaspis massaiensis comb. nov. is widespread in the Kenyan and northern Tanzanian highlands, isolated dryland montane forests and rocky hills, while P. tsavoensis sp. nov. occur in the expansive arid lowlands of Tsavo Conservation Area and should be present in similar arid lowlands in northern Kenya as well as in adjacent Tanzania.

SUSTAINABILITY												Centella asiatica is an herbal plant with many health benefits due to the content of asiaticoside compounds. Factors affecting asiaticoside content are altitude, soil texture, and soil nutrient status. This research aimed to identify the effect of zeolite, P2O5 fertilizer, and soil media from different altitudes on C. asiatica. The research was conducted in a greenhouse from August 2017-June 2018. The experimental design was a factorial, completely randomized design with three factors and four replications. The first factor was soil media that originated from 100, 450, and 900 m above sea level (asl), the second factor was the dose of P2O5 fertilizer (0, 27, 54, and 81 kg ha(-1)), and the third was the dose of zeolite (0, 3, and 6 t ha(-1)). The results showed that applying zeolite minerals at all altitudes increased nutrient availability and soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) by up to 70%. The novelty of this study is that the soil from an altitude of 900 m asl, with a P2O5 fertilizer dose of 54 kg ha(-1), has a loamy sand soil texture and produces the highest asiaticoside content (3.61%) and the largest plant dry weight (19.24 g). These results did not significantly differ from those obtained from the soil 450 m asl with a sandy loam soil texture (the most suitable soil texture for C. asiatica), that is 3.37% asiaticoside and 19.87 g plant dry weight. This study concluded that C. asiatica could develop in loamy sand soil by giving it 54 kg ha(-1) P2O5 fertilizer.

Understanding socio-spatial perceptions and Badlands ecosystem services valuation. Is there any welfare in soil erosion?	LAND USE POLICY												Badlands are one of the dryland ecosystems where the absence of the regulating ecosystem service (ES) of erosion control enables the provision of cultural ESs, which include, among others, a singular landscape. The lack of consideration of the social value of these areas, due to their low productive value and low biodiversity, has led to their transformation and disappearance. At the same time, the scientific literature that deals with social pref-erences for the management of these ecosystems is scarce, despite the need to manage these spaces to face the future adverse effects of climate change. This gap can be reduced by establishing a framework for the socio-economic valuation of the Badlands. Therefore, these paper aims to evaluate the social demand for the imple-mentation of management measures to ensure Badlands protection, using as a case study the Region of Murcia Badlands (SE Spain). To this end, a survey was carried out among a representative sample of households in this region; the willingness to pay (WTP) to protect such singular ecosystems and the factors that influence their valuation were studied, especially the spatial component, analysing in detail the protest behaviour (PB). The results show a strong PB in the population (44.29 % of the sample), with a mean WTP of 15.93 euro/household/ year. Despite the population's preference for the promotion of regulating ESs in eroded areas in general, cultural ESs are more important in the case of Badlands, positively in terms of WTP and negatively for PB. Spatial factors were found to be of great importance in the valuation, showing the existence of local patterns. These results will help decision-makers to achieve more efficient and socially accepted spatial planning in the management of singular eroded areas.

The Palouse region of the Pacific Northwest in the US, a vast area of undulating fertile farmland, has relatively high in-field variation in water retention and crop yield due to regional topography and uneven soil erosion. The regional agricultural systems depend on the soil at or near field capacity towards the end of a wet spring to support crops throughout the summer drought period. Dryland agricultural systems and high in-field variation and changing climate make water retention management practices throughout the region critical. A finite element vadose zone transport model was developed and used to understand the benefits of the targeted application of biochar on water retention and water redistribution in a representative hillslope. The model utilizes measured soil hydraulic properties to predict soil moisture distribution over the dry season. A Redwood Sawdust and Wheat Straw biochar was amended at 4% and 7% concentrations by mass. Biochar amended soils showed an increase in water retention and apparent reduction in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity as the soil approached saturated conditions. After two months of bare field evaporation, the model showed that biochar impacts water redistribution in the soil profile, contributing to positive and negative changes and a net increase in water retention. Model outputs with biochar showed increased retention in and around the amendment area, although the magnitude between outputs varied, with some samples showing minimal effectiveness. Despite the differences in magnitude with targeted biochar amendment, these results indicate that biochar can change water redistribution (up to 0.5%) in a soil profile. Additionally, the developed model shows promise as a field and regional level management tool to determine the best return on investment from biochar application when applied in a targeted manner.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				MAR 1	2023	277								108026	10.1016/j.agwat.2022.108026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2022.108026		DEC 2022											WOS:000909885200001

The decline of soil water formed the dried soil layers (DSLs), which is particularly relevant for dryland ecosystems like the forests planted on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP), because there is an increased water demand for vegetation transpiration. To assess the impacts of precipitation changes on DSLs, we conducted a large throughfall manipulation experiment comprising seven precipitation gradients, ranging from 30%, 50%, and 65% precipitation interception treatments (PIT) to the ambient condition and then to 30%, 50% and 65% precipitation accession treatments (PAT), under a Robinia pseudoacacia planting forest on the CLP. We measured changes in soil water content (SWC) and examined the development of DSLs for over a year. We found that: (1) mean SWC in the 0-2100 cm soil profile and in DSLs decreased by 0.44%-0.77% and 0.13%-0.36% under the PIT, respectively, while increasing by 0.13%-0.36% and 0.16%-0.92% under the PAT, respectively; (2) DSLs were observed c. 100 cm and c. 100-180 cm below the soil surface under the PIT and PAT, respectively; (3) DSLs varied seasonally, with the largest reduction occurring during the transition period between the dry and rainy seasons, while the reduction developed more rapidly under the PAT than the PIT; (4) the incremental rate of SWC in DSLs increased linearly (p < 0.05) with increasing precipitation, while the in-crease was faster when precipitation was above (PAT) than below the ambient conditions (PIT), indicating greater precipitation sensitivity of DSLs under enriched than limited water supply. These changes in DSLs provide experimental evidence for the effects of climate change on soil water, and may have strong effect on the sustainable development management of drylands.

However, there is a lack of accurate data on the spatial distribution and change of BSCs. Here, two indices were developed to enhance BSC mapping, including the sandy land ratio crust index (SRCI) for sandy land with moss-dominated BSCs and the desert ratio crust index (DRCI) for desert with lichen-dominated BSCs. The SRCI combines the near infrared band in which moss-dominated BSCs and other surface components have significant spectral differences, and red edge bands in which such differences can be enhanced. Another index, the DRCI, highlights different spectral characteristics of lichen-dominated BSCs, gravel and sand in the shortwave infrared and red-edge bands. A random forest (RF) machine learning framework was developed to map the large-scale BSC distribution with 10 m resolution using Sentinel 2 satellite data. The results show that the BSC area in the Mu Us Sandy Land and Gurbantunggut Desert of China covers 10,647 km2 and 14,036 km2, accounting for 5.7% and 29.4% of the total area, respectively, indicating that BSC is one of the dominant land cover types in the Gurbantunggut Desert. Validations and comparisons demonstrate that the overall accuracy of BSC detection is 90% and 94% with kappa coefficients of 0.80 and 0.86 in sandy land and desert, respectively, and the proposed SRCI and DRCI increase the overall mapping accuracy by 6% for sandy land and desert compared to the non-index scheme. Therefore, indices can enhance the BSC mapping accuracy for sandy land and desert. Moreover, this work provides basic data for exploring the ecological effects of BSCs in arid areas.

Quantifying the influence of different biocrust community states and their responses to warming temperatures on soil biogeochemistry in field and mesocosm studies	GEODERMA												Biocrusts influence soil biogeochemistry by fixing carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) and through leachate inputs to soils. Functional rates can vary among biocrust community states and in response to edaphic properties, heterotrophic microbial activity, and global change. Using soils and biocrusts from the Colorado Plateau, Utah, USA, we aimed to quantify the influence of early-successional (ES) and late-successional (LS) biocrust community states on soil biogeochemistry. In a field setting, we found soil was less "fertile" under ES than LS biocrust, but ES biocrust had a relative influence 1.3 times greater than LS biocrust on soil fertility. Leachate collected from LS biocrust had, on average, 6 times more organic C and 1.7 times more dissolved N than ES biocrust, but concentrations of phosphorus (P) and inorganic N did not differ among the two biocrust types. To disentangle influences of biocrusts and soil properties on biogeochemical pools, we constructed mesocosms from homogenized soil and left the surface bare or covered with ES or LS biocrust, before assignment to ambient or warmed (+5 degrees C) temperature treatments for 3 months. Multivariate biogeochemical properties differed among cover types, yet all exhibited losses of P, N, and organic C and nearly half of the biogeochemical variables considered did not differ among cover types. Mesocosms with LS biocrust retained more dissolved N, supported 8 additional, significant correlations among biogeochemical pools of the biocrust and mineral soil layer on average, and lost fewer of these correlations under warming. Overall, while soils under LS biocrusts were more fertile (i.e., had higher nutrient concentrations) than under ES, we did not find evidence implicating leachate as the primary driver of this difference. Biocrust influences on soil fertility were greater when mineral soil nutrients were in lower concentrations, highlighting the value of even incipient biocrusts for dryland functioning.																			0016-7061	1872-6259				MAR 1	2022	409								115633	10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115633	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115633													WOS:000788128600006

Water-seeking behavior among terrestrial arthropods and mollusks in a cool mesic region: Spatial and temporal patterns	PLOS ONE												Dehydration can have negative effects on animal physiological performance, growth, reproduction, and survival, and most animals seek to minimize these effects by reducing water losses or seeking water sources. Much-but not all-of the research on animal water balance comes from dryland ecosystems. However, animals inhabiting mesic regions may also experience desiccating conditions, for example within urban heat islands or during heatwaves and droughts. Here we examined how spatial variation in impervious surface and spatial and temporal variation in microclimate impact water demand behavior of terrestrial arthropods and mollusks in three areas of mesic Northwest Ohio, with analysis of taxa that exhibited the greatest water demand behavior. Water demand behavior was measured as the frequency that individuals were observed at an artificial water source (a moistened pouch), relative to the frequency at a control (a dry pouch). Overall, terrestrial arthropods and mollusks were found about twice as often at the water source than at the control (equivalent to 86 more observations on the wet pouch than on dry at each site, on average), with ants accounting for over 50% of the overall response in urban areas. Daily fluctuations in vapor pressure deficit (VPD) best predicted daily variation in water demand behavior, with increased demand at higher VPD. Mean VPD was generally highest near urbanized areas, but effects of VPD on water demand behavior were generally lower in urbanized areas (possibly related to reductions in overall abundance reducing the potential response). On certain days, VPD was high in natural areas and greenspaces, and this coincided with the highest arthropod water demand behavior observed. Our results suggest that terrestrial arthropod communities do experience periods of water demand within mesic regions, including in greenspaces outside cities, where they appear to respond strongly to short periods of dry conditions-an observation with potential relevance for understanding the effects of climate change.

Vegetation responses to climatic and geologic controls on water availability in southeastern Arizona	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Vegetation distribution, composition and health in arid regions are largely dependent on water availability controlled by climate, local topography and geology. Despite a general understanding of climatic and geologic drivers in plant communities, trends in plant responses to water distribution and storage across areas under different local controls are poorly understood. Here we investigate the multi-decadal interactions between spatial heterogeneity of geologic controls and temporal variation of climate, and their impacts on water availability to vegetation and plant responses (via normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) in a monsoon-driven arid region of southeastern Arizona. We find that grasslands display low NDVI and respond directly to monsoonal rainfall. In the uplands, vegetation on west-facing slopes and in canyons share similar NDVI averages and variability, suggesting that they both use water from surface-groundwater flow paths through fractured rocks. Along the San Pedro River, streamflow, groundwater, and NDVI in deciduous riparian woodlands are strongly responsive to monsoonal rainfall, but water availability stratifies between wet (perennial), intermediate, and dry reaches, underlain by different local geologic controls that affect water table elevation. These controls interact with the driving climate to affect water availability in the shallow alluvial aquifer of the riparian zone, a primary water source to the gallery phreatophytes. A recent shift toward a strengthened monsoon in the region has led to an increase in water availability for grasslands and for dry reaches of the San Pedro, while the benefit is more muted along wetter reaches, where the riparian forest shows signs of having reached its maturity, with diminished trends in NDVI. These results have implications for the future vulnerability of dryland vegetation to climate change, which may be either dampened or intensified by local controls such as geology.

J	Zhao, Y; Wang, J				Zhao, Yang; Wang, Jin			Mechanical sand fixing is more beneficial than chemical sand fixing for artificial cyanobacteria crust colonization and development in a sand desert	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												The incubation of biological soil crusts (BSCs) can potentially determine a decrease in abiotic stress levels, which can then shift the state of the ecosystem and combat desertification due to their key ecological roles in drylands. Stabilized sand soil surface is the primary factor for natural and induced BSCs successful establishment in harsh dryland environments. Mechanical sand fixing, such as straw checkerboard barriers and chemical sand fixing are two effective ways to stabilized sandy soil surface. The impacts of these two sand fixing methods on artificial cyanobacteria colonization have not been frequently been compared in the field. In this study, five cyanobacteria, Anabaena sp., Nostoc sp., Phormidium sp., Scytonema sp. and Tolypothrix sp. were isolated and cultured. The straw checkerboard method was represented mechanical sand fixing and W-OH (modified water-borne polyurethane) method was used to test chemical sand fixing. Coverage, thickness and biomass of artificial cyanobacterial crust as well as wind erosion intensity and dust deposition were measured after 16 months of inoculation. Results show that the highest coverage, thickness and biomass of artificial cyanobacterial crust was in the straw checkerboard mechanical method, with cyanobacteria measuring higher than other treatments (p < 0.05) at 28.3%, 3.01 mm and 0.24 mg cm(-2), respectively, and showed both positive relationships with dust deposition and herb coverage, but negatively with wind erosion intensity (p < 0.05). Thus, mechanical sand fixing was more beneficial to artificial cyanobacterial crust incubation in field conditions rather than chemical sand fixing, due to sustaining increase in dust deposition to sand surface stability. In addition, mechanical sand fixing uses lessees water than chemical sand fixing. Our results also indicated that annual herb coverage should be closely managed during the artificial cyanobacterial crust incubation in field conditions.																			0929-1393	1873-0272				AUG	2019	140						115	120		10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.04.008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.04.008													WOS:000466929200014

Impacts of Intensified Cropping Systems on Soil Water Use by Spring Wheat	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												In semiarid dryland farming regions, No-till and intensified crop rotations may improve water use. Our objective was to determine water use efficiency (WUE) and precipitation use efficiency (PUE) for spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L; SW) grown in crop sequences representing different levels of intensification, under minimum (Min-till) or No-till. Root zone (0-122 cm) water at planting (SWP) was 2.76 cm higher for two- and three-phase sequences under Min-till than continuous spring wheat (CSW), and sequences with fallow averaged 2.65 cm higher than those without. Conversely, SWP was unaffected by sequence under No-till, with less effect of fallow. Root zone water at harvest was unaffected by the number of crop phases or fallow under Min-till. However, values for CSW exceeded the two- or three-phase sequences by 1.57 and 2.53 cm under No-till, and sequences without fallow averaged 1.52 cm more than those with fallow. The highest WUE (8.4 kg grain ha(-1) mm(-1) water) was observed when SW was grown in three-phase sequences compared with 7.7 kg grain ha(-1) mm(-1) water, for CSW and SW-fallow. Spring wheat under Min-till had higher WUE in sequences with fallow, but no effects of fallow occurred with No-till. The lowest PUE (near 3 kg grain ha(-1) mm(-1) precipitation) and no effects of tillage were found in sequences with fallow. However, SW in continuously cropped sequences had PUE between 5.5 and 6.4 kg grain ha(-1) mm(-1) precipitation and was higher under No-till. Both WUE and PUE are affected by intensification but may also be influenced by patterns of weather.

This study elaborated for isolation, morpho-physiological, biochemical characterization and molecular identification of indigenous soil microbes from Thal desert of Pakistan and their application to elucidate the efficacy of desert isolates on yield of chickpeas growing on three farmer fields (Kakri, Adhi Kot and Jara) of native area. Isolates were identified through 16sRNA sequencing and used to formulate eight consortia with different combination. Four isolates (Bacillus subtilis RP-01, Enterobacter cloacae RP-08, Bacillus mojavensis RS-14 and Providencia vermicola RS-15) have ability to produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), Protease, catalase, ACCdeaminase and EPS, among, the two strains RP-01 and RP-08 were found phosphate solubilizer and others two isolates Mesorhizobium ciceri RZ-11 and Mesorhizobium ciceri RZ-22 were appeared as ammonia producing. The consortia in T7 showed highest grain yield (1201kg ha-1) followed by T2 (1126kg ha-1) at same location (Kakri) comparatively to other consortia and control (557kg ha-1). Similarly, T2 found most promising consortia regarding grain yield (1072.1kg ha-1 and 961.8kg ha-1) at locations Adhi Kot and Jara, respectively during the 1st year. However, T4 also performed with par to T2 and T7 consortium and same trend was seen in the next year field experiments. The present study confirmed that T2 (Mesorhizobium ciceri RZ-11 + Bacillus subtilis RP-01 + Bacillus mojavensis RS-14), T4 (Mesorhizobium ciceri RZ-11 + Enterobacter cloacae RP-08 + Providencia vermicola RS-15) and T7 (Mesorhizobium ciceri RZ22 + Enterobacter cloacae RP-08 + Providencia vermicola RS-15) are promising consortia for chickpeas yield in Thal desert of Punjab, Pakistan.																			0379-3575	2357-0288				APR	2023	45	1					99	110		10.21608/AGRO.2023.159807.1336	http://dx.doi.org/10.21608/AGRO.2023.159807.1336													WOS:001037014700007

This study aimed to identify the QTL linked to yield, its components, end-use quality traits including kernel, flour, and dough rheology, and related agronomic traits under dryland and irrigated conditions. A mapping population of 179 F-2:6 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from 'TAM 111'/'TX05A001822' was evaluated for these traits to investigate their genetic stability and phenotypic plasticity using 2658 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with 35 linkage groups. Traits associated with chromosome regions were detected for individual and across-environment QTL by inclusive composite interval mapping. A total of 30 QTL regions were identified, including 14 consistent QTLs mapped on 11 chromosomes and six pleiotropic QTLs mapped on 5 chromosomes. Three consistent QTLs in chromosomes 1A, 3B, and 6D might be novel. Three major QTLs with both consistent and pleiotropic effects were co-localized with known genes. The first QTL for dough mixing properties was physically clustered around Glu-D1 and had an phenotypic variation explained (PVE) up to 31.3%. The second QTL for kernel-related traits was physically close to the TaCWI-4A (cell wall invertase) gene, which influences the thousand kernel weight, heading date, and harvest index, with a PVE of up to 12.3%. The third QTL, which was colocalized with the TaCWI-5D gene for kernel traits, was identified with a PVE of 6.7%. Epistasis was also detected, but major QTLs were not involved in significant epistasis or interactions with environmental effects. The current study provided new information that is useful for enhanced wheat breeding, which will benefit from the deployment of the favorable alleles for end-use quality, yield, and other agronomic traits in wheat-breeding programs through marker-assisted selection.

As a result, connectivity between river channels and floodplain wetlands has diminished. Wetland function is fundamentally linked to water availability: flooding exchanges water, nutrients, sediments and biota with the floodplain. Water allocation for environmental flows may mitigate wetland degradation following river regulation by improving hydrological connectivity between rivers and floodplain wetlands. We report the results (2014-15 to 2018-19) of a vegetation monitoring program in the Macquarie Marshes in north western New South Wales. As part of the long-term program, we monitored semi-permanent wetland (Water Couch (Paspalum distichum) grassland or sedgeland dominated) and River Red Gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) forest/woodland communities along with environmental and water resource availability predictors. During the five-year period, we found linear and nonlinear responses of functional group abundance and species richness to the water year and to time since last inundation. We also found differences in species assemblages in response to the flow and flooding regime, particularly water year and inundation duration. These results indicated that wetlands continued to express dry and wet phase responses. We also observed a depressed response to the large 2016-17 flood event by a subset of semi-permanent wetland sites that had not been inundated in 3 years, compared with sites that were more recently inundated. This result indicated that environmental water management, along with protection of natural inundation events, may improve the resilience of floodplain wetlands: increased hydrological connectivity may promote a stronger wetland response when floods occur. Our results indicate that inundation, in part comprised of managed environmental flows, is a primary driver of species assemblage and functional group representation in semi-arid floodplain wetlands.

Cropping systems alter plant volatile emissions in the field through soil legacy effects	RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS												Crops emit a variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that serve as attractants or repellents for pests and their natural enemies. Crop rotations, off-farm chemical inputs, and mechanical and cultural tactics - collectively called cropping systems - alter soil nutrients, moisture content, and microbial communities, all of which have the potential to alter crop VOC emissions. Soil legacy effects of diversified cropping systems have been shown to enhance crop VOC emissions in greenhouse studies, but how they influence emissions under field conditions remains virtually unknown. To determine the effect of cropping systems on plant VOC emissions in the field, air samples were collected from the headspace of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. Judee) grown in simplified wheat-fallow rotations or diversified wheat-cover crop rotations where cover crops were terminated by grazing cattle. Across two growing seasons, wheat grown in rotation with fallow emitted greater amounts of Z-3-hexenyl acetate and beta-ocimene, key attractants for wheat stem sawfly (Cephus cinctus Norton), a major pest of wheat. While overall VOC blends were relatively similar among cropping system during the first growing season, emissions varied substantially in the second year of this study where wheat grown in rotation with cover crops emitted substantially greater quantities of volatile compounds characteristic of abiotic stress. Below-average precipitation in the second growing season, in addition to reduced soil water content in cover crop rotations, suggests that cropping system effects on wheat VOCs may have been driven primarily by water availability, a major factor limiting crop growth in dryland agriculture. While the specific mechanisms driving changes in VOC emissions were not explicitly tested, this work shows that agricultural practices applied in one growing season can differentially influence crop VOC emissions in the next through soil legacy effects, illustrating additional avenues through which cropping systems may be leveraged to enhance pest management.

An important challenge of climate-oriented peatland management is an improved conservation of their huge carbon stocks. Paludiculture, the productive use of wet peatlands, is a promising land use alternative that reduces greenhouse gas emissions substantially since it requires rewetting of peatlands. As rewetting is accompanied by productive use, it offers a sustainability innovation for farmers and other land users. There is an emerging knowledge base on paludiculture but no empirical study of paludiculture and its diffusion as an international innovation. The paper closes this research gap presenting the results of a survey of paludiculture projects in a variety of global contexts. It shows paludiculture to be an emerging, science-driven and collaborative innovation that faces adverse pathdependency from drained peatland exploitation. There is a diversity of paludicultures for fuel, fodder, horticultural substrate and construction material, but these are rarely directly commercially viable. A third of initiatives see themselves in continuity with traditional but often marginalized uses of peatlands. Paludiculture is a complex, critical sustainability innovation mission calling for a multiple-objective strategy and a sustainability-oriented form of governance. As biomass from paludiculture per se can almost never compete with dryland alternatives, we recommend i) to initiate and sustain large-scale programmes to develop products that exploit the unique properties of wetland plants across market, public and communal uses, ii) to develop integrative concepts for payments for ecosystem services associated with wet peatlands, iii) a complementary focus on ending subsidies and policy support for drainage-based peatland use, as well as iv) inclusive stakeholder involvement from the start as well as sustained policy support to foster paludiculture as the productive niche within a culture of living sustainably with peatlands.

The 42 leading and modern cultivars released between 1991 and 2012 were subjected to drought (45% Field water-holding capacity), and well-watered (75% Field water-holding capacity) for 3 weeks to evaluate the genetic progress of wheat against drought stress. Seeds of the drought-sensitive cultivar (CM104) primed with ethephon were subjected to soil water deficit and well-watered to uncover ethephon-induced stress responses at organic, cellular, and molecular levels. Soil water deficit (45% FC) occurred at the tillering stage resulted in 3.2 to 67.4% yield loss, and genetic improvement of wheat against drought resulted in the yield loss decreased at a rate of 0.70% per year, which was determined mainly by fertile spike. Seed ethephon priming maintained leaf water under soil water deficit at the tillering stage by improving root volume and dry weight, which maintained leaf water and improved the drought avoidance capability of wheat. Seed ethephon priming decreased leaf malondialdehyde content by regulating root ERF, root to leaf ABA signaling, leaf ROS-scavenging capability, and leaf osmotic regulation, which improved the drought tolerance capability of dryland wheat. Comparative root tips transcriptome analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes and pathways involved in ethylene-induced drought tolerance are associated with carbon metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. At maturity, seed ethephon priming increased fertile spikes and reduced spikelets abortion, which provided extra 0.3 t ha(-1) of grain yield. These results suggested that seed ethephon priming allowed the recall of long-lasting stress defensive memory, increasing fertile spikes and grain yield by both drought avoidance and drought tolerance.

However, the mechanisms underlying these processes remain unclear. Location: The study took place at the Ebinur Lake Wetland Nature Reserve of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. Methods: This study integrated taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and environmental factors to evaluate ecosystem multifunctionality and the factors influencing nutrient cycling within 66 dryland communities with different vertical structures. Results: Both unweighted and weighted diversity had significant impacts on ecosystem multifunctionality and the cycling of C, N, and P. However, only weighted diversity had a significant impact on the woody and herb layers. The main factors influencing ecosystem multifunctionality at the community level were soil moisture and functional diversity, whereas those influencing the woody layer were soil moisture and plant functional traits, and those influencing the herb layer were phylogenetic diversity and taxonomic diversity. The multifunctionality of the woody layer and community showed a positive relationship with changes in soil moisture and salinity. Conclusions: The results of the study showed the existence of both mass ratio effects and richness effects of ecosystem multifunctionality at the community level, whereas the woody and herb layers were mainly affected by the complementary effects. Biotic and abiotic factors explained the multifunctionality and nutrient cycling of the ecosystem at the community level to a greater extent than those in the woody and herb layers separately. In addition, biotic and abiotic factors explain ecosystem multifunctionality more than nutrient cycling, and ecosystem multifunctionality was found to explain more than a single nutrient cycle. The multifunctionality of the ecosystem and the ability to restore specific nutrient cycles can be maximized through the hierarchical assessment of community diversity to prevent desertification in drylands.					wang, qiang/IZW-1751-2023; LI, QI/IUM-8577-2023; Li, Kun/JLL-6505-2023; Li, Ye/JBS-2949-2023; Li, bo/IWL-9318-2023; li, bai/JNE-1502-2023	Li, Kun/0000-0002-3638-2974; Yang, Xiao-Dong/0000-0002-3553-2125													1470-160X	1872-7034				SEP	2021	128								107830	10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107830	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107830		MAY 2021											WOS:000663325100001

Riparian plant species differ in sensitivity to both the mean and variance in groundwater stores	JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY												Aims Determining the ecological consequences of interactions between slow changes in long-term climate means and amplified variability in climate is an important research frontier in plant ecology. We combined the recent approach of climate sensitivity functions with a revised hydrological 'bucket model' to improve predictions on how plant species will respond to changes in the mean and variance of groundwater resources. Methods We leveraged spatiotemporal variation in long-term datasets of riparian vegetation cover and groundwater levels to build the first groundwater sensitivity functions for common plant species of dryland riparian corridors. Our results demonstrate the value of this approach to identifying which plant species will thrive (or fail) in an increasingly variable climate layered with declining groundwater stores. Important Findings Riparian plant species differed in sensitivity to both the mean and variance in groundwater levels. Rio Grande cottonwood (Populus deltoides ssp. wislizenii) cover was predicted to decline with greater inter-annual groundwater variance, while coyote willow (Salix exigua) and other native wetland species were predicted to benefit from greater year-to-year variance. No non-native species were sensitive to groundwater variance, but patterns for Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia) predict declines under deeper mean groundwater tables. Warm air temperatures modulated groundwater sensitivity for cottonwood, which was more sensitive to variability in groundwater in years/sites with warmer maximum temperatures than in cool sites/periods. Cottonwood cover declined most with greater intra-annual coefficients of variation (CV) in groundwater, but was not significantly correlated with inter-annual CV, perhaps due to the short time series (16 years) relative to cottonwood lifespan. In contrast, non-native tamarisk (Tamarix chinensis) cover increased with both intra-and inter-annual CV in groundwater. Altogether, our results predict that changes in groundwater variability and mean will affect riparian plant communities through the differential sensitivities of individual plant species to mean versus variance in groundwater stores.																			1752-9921	1752-993X				OCT	2020	13	5					621	632		10.1093/jpe/rtaa049	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jpe/rtaa049													WOS:000591564700012

However, it remains unclear how biochar regulates soil carbon (C) and N to mitigate N losses induced by straw mixing with N fertilizer in dryland soils. Therefore, we investigated the effects of straw mixing (S-1), S(1)with biochar (SB) and no straw inputs (S-0), and routine urea application rates (N-1) and 70% of routine rates (N-0.7) on yields and N losses, and identify the relationship between N losses and soil C and N compounds. Results showed that N(0.7)and N(1)were suitable for the maize and wheat seasons, respectively, contributing to mitigating N losses without reducing crop yields. Moreover, in the maize season, N-0.7-SB significantly mitigated the straw-induced NH3-N and N2O-N emissions by 106% and 81%, respectively. In the wheat season, N-1-SB reduced the straw-induced NH3-N and N2O-N emissions by 35% and 66%, respectively. In addition, N-0.7-SB sharply reduced soil inorganic N (SIN) storage in the maize season. Furthermore, the NH3-N and N2O-N emission rates were negatively correlated with dissolved organic carbon/SIN content (0-20 cm) (DOC/SIN0-20). N losses (N2O-N and NH3-N emissions and SIN storage) were positively correlated with SIN0-20, but negatively correlated with soil organic carbon / SIN0-20(SOC/ SIN0-20). This study provides further evidence that biochar with an appropriate N application rate decreased SIN(0-20)and increased DOC/SIN0-20, thus reducing SIN storage and the straw-induced gaseous N emissions without decreasing crop yields.

A growing body of evidence links climate-related risk to the extent and the persistence of rural poverty in these environments. Stochastic shocks erode smallholder farmers' long-term livelihood potential through loss of productive assets. The resulting uncertainty impedes progress out of poverty by acting as a disincentive to investment in agriculture - by farmers, rural financial services, value chain institutions and governments. We assess evidence published in the last ten years that a set of production technologies and institutional options for managing risk can stabilize production and incomes, protect assets in the face of shocks, enhance uptake of improved technologies and practices, improve farmer welfare, and contribute to poverty reduction in risk-prone smallholder agricultural systems. Production technologies and practices such as stress-adapted crop germplasm, conservation agriculture, and diversified production systems stabilize agricultural production and incomes and, hence, reduce the adverse impacts of climate-related risk under some circumstances. Institutional interventions such as index-based insurance and social protection through adaptive safety nets play a complementary role in enabling farmers to manage risk, overcome risk-related barriers to adoption of improved technologies and practices, and protect their assets against the impacts of extreme climatic events. While some research documents improvements in household welfare indicators, there is limited evidence that the risk-reduction benefits of the interventions reviewed have enabled significant numbers of very poor farmers to escape poverty. We discuss the roles that climate-risk management interventions can play in efforts to reduce rural poverty, and the need for further research on identifying and targeting environments and farming populations where improved climate risk management could accelerate efforts to reduce rural poverty.

How these fisheries may have functioned is still poorly known. Although many studies have drawn attention to how Pre-Hispanic inhabitants of these savannas managed to deal with excess water, little attention has been paid to understanding how large and permanent populations were sustained during long periods of drought. In the Llanos de Mojos, one of the largest savannas in South America, the landscape is greatly affected by the impacts of annual, seasonal flooding and inundations, alternating with a dry period that can last 4-6 months. The fishing practices in this area were studied on the basis of analysis of more than 17,000 fish remains recovered at Loma Salvatierra, a monumental mound located in an interfluvial area 50 km from the Mamore River and occupied between 500 and 1400 AD. In Loma Salvatierra, a network of circular walled ponds connected to a system of canals has been identified, raising questions about a possible use of these structures for fishing. The exceptional conservation of the bone material has enabled precise taxonomic identification of more than 35 taxa, the richest fish spectrum thus far documented in the Mojos region. The dominant fish, swamp-eels (Synbranchus spp.), armored catfishes (Hoplosternum spp.), lungfish (Lepidosiren paradoxa), and tiger-fish (Hoplias malabaricus) are characteristic of shallow and stagnant waters. Our work documents the first zooarchaeological evidence of a dryland, interfluvial fishing system in the Bolivian Amazon that incorporates distinct species and fishing practices, demonstrating that these regions contain year round resources. Research is taking its first steps toward understanding landscape modifications, fish environments, and specific cultural technologies employed on this and other lowland neotropical savannas that differ from those for fishing in open waters and rivers.

However, the interactive effects of cropping system and fertilisation on microbial residues and their contributions to SOC have not been addressed. Herein, we used amino sugars as tracers for microbial residues and analysed the dynamics of microbial residues in a 31-year-long experiment in a highland agroecosystem to understand how effects of fertilisation vary with cropping systems. The cropping systems included continuous alfalfa (AC, a pure legume system), continuous winter wheat (WC, a non-legume system) and grain-legume rotation (GLR) system. The fertilization treatments were the unfertilised control (CK), phosphorus (P), P and nitrogen (NP) and NP and manure (NPM). When averaged across the experimental periods, compared with the GLR and WC systems, the AC system increased microbial residues, the ratio of fungal-to-bacterial residues and the contribution of fungal residues to SOC. The NP and NPM increased microbial residues, and the effects of NPM were greater than those of NP. However, the contribution of microbial residues to SOC was lower in the NPM treatment than that in the NP treatment. The effects of NP or NPM on microbial residues were similar among cropping systems, while the effect of P was greater in the AC system but smaller in the WC system in comparison with those in the GLR system. Therefore, the pure legume cropping system was conducive to SOC accumulation mainly by increasing fungal residues in soils. Manure combined with chemical fertilisers was more beneficial to the accumulation of microbial residues, but SOC accumulation caused by it was less attributable to the increase in microbial-derived C. Moreover, P fertiliser was crucial for the accumulation of microbial residues in legume-included cropping systems. Highlights This study addresses effects of fertilization on microbial residues in three cropping systems. The effects of NP or NPM on microbial residues were similar among cropping systems. The effect of P fertilizer on microbial residues varied with cropping system. Legume cropping system was conducive to SOC accumulation mainly by increasing fungal residues.

Unfortunately, the impacts of microplastics (MPs) on agricultural soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics have not been sufficiently reported. In an attempt to remedy this, we conducted a 105-day out-door mesocosm experiment in a soil-plant system using sandy soils amended with two types of MPs, low-density polyethylene (LDPE-MPs) and biodegradable (Bio-MPs), at concentrations of 0.0% (control), 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0% and 2.5% (w/w, weight ratio of microplastics to air-dry soil). Soil organic matter (SOM), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC), available nitrogen (AN) of N-NH4+ and N-NO3-, and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) were measured on day 46 (D46) and 105 (D105) of the experiment. SOM was also measured after microplastics were mixed into soils (D0). For LDPE-MPs treatments, SOM on D0, D46 and D105 showed no significant differences, while for Bio-MPs treatments, SOM significantly (p <0.05) decreased from D0 to D46. Compared to the control, soil POXC was significantly (p = 0.001) lowered by 0.5%, 1.0% and 2.5% LDPE-MPs and >= 1.0% Bio-MPs on D105. LDPE-MPs showed no significant effects on soil DOC and nitrogen cycling. 2.0% and 2.5% Bio-MPs showed significantly higher (p < 0.001) DOC and DON (on D46 and D105) and >= 1.5% Bio-MPs showed significantly lower (p = 0.02) AN (on D46). Overall, Bio-MPs exerted stronger effects on the dynamics of soil carbon and nitrogen cycling. In conclusion, microplastics might pose serious threats to agroecosystems and further research is needed.

Ecosystem groundwater use enhances carbon assimilation and tree growth in a semi-arid Oak Savanna	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Ecosystem reliance on groundwater, defined here as water stored in the saturated zone deeper than one meter beneath the surface, has been documented in many semi-arid, arid, and seasonally-dry regions around the world. In California, groundwater sustains ecosystems and mitigates mortality during drought. However, the effect of groundwater on carbon cycling still remains largely unresolved. Here we use 20 years of eddy covariance, groundwater, and tree growth measurements to isolate the impact of groundwater on carbon cycling in a semiarid Mediterranean system in California during the summer dry season. We show that daily ecosystem groundwater use increases under positive groundwater anomalies and is associated with increased carbon assimilation and evapotranspiration rates. Negative groundwater anomalies result in significantly reduced ecosystem groundwater uptake, gross primary productivity, and evapotranspiration, with a simultaneous increase in water use efficiency. Three machine learning algorithms better predict gross primary productivity and tree growth anomalies when trained using groundwater data. These models suggest that groundwater has a unique effect on carbon assimilation and allocation to woody growth. After controlling for the effect of soil moisture, which is often decoupled from groundwater dynamics at the site, wet groundwater anomalies increase canopy carbon assimilation by 179.4 +/- 25.7 g C m-2 (17 % of annual gross primary productivity) over the course of the summer season relative to dry groundwater anomalies. Similarly, annual tree growth increases by 0.175 +/- 0.035 mm (17.7 % of annual growth) between dry and wet groundwater anomalies, independent of soil moisture dynamics. Our results demonstrate the importance of deep subsurface water resources to carbon assimilation and woody growth in dryland systems, as well as the benefits of collocated, long-term eddy covariance and ancillary datasets to improve understanding of complex ecosystem dynamics.

However, the advent of synthetic fibers has led to a decrease in research on Agave, resulting in the cessation of breeding programs in Brazil. With the rise of climate change, there is renewed interest in Agave for its potential as a biofuel feedstock in semiarid regions. Since 2016, we have been collecting Agave accessions throughout the country and retrieving what is left of Brazil's original breeding program to establish a new germplasm bank. Here, we evaluated 21 of those accessions growing in the field. We used molecular markers and morphophysiological traits to characterize the plants. Based on the Mayahuelin molecular marker, we were able to reconstruct a phylogeny for the Brazilian accessions. The morphophysiological traits explained 34.6% of the phenotypic variation in the dataset, with physiological traits such as leaf water content, effective quantum efficiency of photosystem II (phi PSII), and specific leaf mass (SLM) as the most significant traits. Specifically, we evaluated nine Agave species and found that the physiological traits, rather than the morphological ones, were the most significant. Leaf water content was negatively correlated with specific leaf mass, which could be used as a marker for selecting cultivars with higher biomass accumulation. Interestingly, phi PSII and chlorophyll content were negatively correlated, suggesting photochemical adaptations throughout the rosette. Molecular and phenotypic data suggest that A. amaniensis, which is frequently considered a synonym of A. sisalana, is effectively another species. Overall, this study provides valuable information on the physiological traits of Brazilian Agave accessions and is a starting point for selecting more productive and climate-resilient cultivars for biorenewables production.																				2673-2718				SEP 20	2023	5								1218668	10.3389/fceng.2023.1218668	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fceng.2023.1218668													WOS:001089172900001

To explore the effects of irrigation systems and levels on the mitigation of N2O and CO2 emissions from maize fields and to determine the balance among greenhouse gases (GHG) emission, water-saving and grain yield, a two-year field exper-iment was conducted in the North China Plain (NCP) during the growing seasons of 2018 and 2019. Two irrigation systems (i.e., flood irrigation, FI, and drip irrigation, DI) were adopted with four irrigation levels in each system, including 65 mm/event (sufficient irrigation, CK), 50 mm/event (decreased by 23 %), 35 mm/event (by 46 %) and 20 mm/event (by 69 %), respectively. The results showed that both irrigation systems and levels had significant effects on soil N2O and CO2 emissions (P < 0.05). Nitrous oxide (N2O) and CO2 emissions peaked following irrigation or irri-gation + fertilization events during sowing to early filling stage (R1), with the peak values increasing with irrigation levels. Meanwhile, peak values from FI were higher than those from DI at 50 mm and 65 mm irrigation levels. The average cumulative N2O and CO2 emissions of DI treatments were 14.9 % and 6.23 % lower than those of FI treatments (P < 0.05), respectively. Soil moisture was identified as one of the most crucial factors influencing N2O and CO2 fluxes. Deficit irrigation efficiently deceased cumulative N2O and CO2 emissions, but moderate to severe deficit irrigation brought significant reduction in grain yield. Drip irrigation with a slight deficit irrigation level (decreased by 23 %) obtained the best economic and environmental benefits, which achieved the dual goal of lower GHG emissions but higher WUE without sacrificing grain yield.

J	Ma, N; Zhang, YQ				Ma, Ning; Zhang, Yongqiang			Increasing Tibetan Plateau terrestrial evapotranspiration primarily driven by precipitation	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												While terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) from the Tibetan Plateau (TP) plays a key role in modulating water storage change in the Asian Water Tower, the magnitude, trend, and drivers of ET remain poorly understood in this region due partially to sparse ground measurements. This study used a water-carbon coupled biophysical model, Penman-Monteith-Leuning Version 2 (PML_V2), to characterize the variations in ET across TP during 1982-2016 and its drivers. Model parameters of PML_V2 were calibrated against ground-observed data from 14 eddy-covariance flux towers. Plot- and basin-scale validations demonstrate that the PML_V2 is robust enough in simulating both magnitude and trend in ET. The 35-year mean annual ET rates decrease from the southeastern to the northwestern TP, leading to a TP-averaged value of 353 +/- 24 mm yr(-1). Soil evaporation is the main component (64%) of ET, followed by plant transpiration (31%) and canopy evaporation (5%). From 1982 to 2016, TP-averaged ET increased significantly with a rate of 1.87 +/- 0.25 mm yr(-2) (p < 0.001) due primarily to precipitation enhancement. Spatially, precipitation is the dominant driver that controls ET trend over most parts of TP except certain regions in the southeastern and eastern TP, where net radiation and temperature do so instead, respectively. This is because 68% of the TP area is dryland with the aridity index < 0.65. While LAI appears less important than climate factors over much of TP, its relative contribution to ET trend exceeds 20% in many parts of eastern TP, indicating that vegetation change played a nonnegligible role in regulating annual ET variations over certain regions where LAI varied substantially. Our results are of vital importance for facilitating the understanding of hydrological processes over the Asian Water Tower.

Various datasets have been applied from local to global scale to study vegetation dynamics and there is a lack of solid comparison among multiple datasets. Note that vegetation growth might shift over time and the greening and browning components over a long-time span might be masked by a linear trend. Here, we aim to monitor the long-term and nonlinear dynamics in vegetation greenness for Inner Mongolia (an important part of dryland Asia). As a useful tool that indicates vegetation greenness, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and LAI (Leaf Area Index) integrals derived from the GIMMS (Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies) NDVI3g and the GIMMS LAI3g products are applied. During the period of 1982-2016, NDVI/LAI integrals have an overall acceptable consistency in characterizing the trends of vegetation greenness, with NDVI large/small integrals and LAI large/small integrals increase at a rate of 0.96, 1.72, 2.23, and 3.13 per decade, respectively. Inner Mongolia experienced a noticeable greening process (71% and 82% greening area in NDVI large/small integrals, 67% and 73% greening area in LAI large/small integrals), despite the fragmentally distributed browning trends in eastern and partial northern Inner Mongolia. As inferred from nonlinear trend analysis, we found the greening process is still prevalent. The browning of eastern Inner Mongolia under the linear analysis was actually transferring from browning to greening, while the greening trend in northern Inner Mongolia was changing to browning. Increased occurrences in the frequency of breakpoints after 1999 suggest that previously stable vegetation ecology is more sensitive to external disturbances such as altered climatic impact and anthropogenic intervention.					, IAMO/G-2328-2012; Kattel, Giri/AAV-3298-2020; Darabi, Hamid/ADV-9381-2022; Change, Structural/W-8306-2019	Kattel, Giri/0000-0002-8348-6477; Darabi, Hamid/0000-0001-7411-1561; Change, Structural/0000-0002-2459-4646; zhang, xin/0000-0003-0394-7972														2072-4292				JUL	2021	13	13							2446	10.3390/rs13132446	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13132446													WOS:000671615400001

Due to population growth, economic development and urbanization, the demand for water in these areas is increasing day by day and with all available resources, water management becomes more and more crucial. Therefore, rain probability analysis is needed to address a number of water management issues and to prevent crop damage due to deficits or excess rainfall. Scientific rainfall forecasting and crop planning can prove to be an important tool in the hands of farmers for better economic returns. An attempt was made to analyze the frequency of different rainfall data. Frequency analysis helps in determining the expected rainfall. An important step in analyzing the frequency of rainfall is selecting a suitable distribution to represent the depth of the rainfall to investigate the precipitation. The distributions namely, Gumbel, Log Normal, Log Pearson Type III and Van Te Chow were used for the prediction of the maximum annual rainfall. Annual rainfall data for 20 years (1991-2010) were collected from the National Institute of Hydrology (NIH), Roorkee, India. This research attempts to fit several theoretical probability distributions to the maximum annual rainfall for daily, two consecutive days, three consecutive days; and to select the best probability distribution for the prediction of maximum annual rainfall for daily, two consecutive days, three consecutive days.For determination of goodness of fit chi-square, percentage absolute deviation, integral square errorwere carried out by comparing the expected values with the observed values. The results found showed that the Gumbel distribution emerged to be the best fit for the prediction of annual maximum rainfall values of Roorkee for one, two and three consecutive days. The second best fit was Ven Te Chow distribution for one, two and three consecutive days.

We converted a long-term alfalfa pasture into RC in 2010, and studied the effects of fertilization on soil moisture, crop productivity, and SOC in the RC and in continuous cropland (CC), both under plastic film mulching, from 2010 to 2018. Before the conversion, alfalfa pasture had a higher SOC (12.3%) and total N (7.7%) than CC. However, not only severe soil desiccation occurred, but the available P and inorganic-N were only about 39.4 and 25.1% of levels for CC. After the conversion, soil moisture in RC (measured at 0-0.6 m depth) was up to CC levels only after 1 year, and was restored to 95.3 and 69.2% of CC levels at 0.6-2 and 2-5 m depths only after 9 years. Crop yield and biomass in RCF (RC with fertilization) were comparable to those for CCF (CC with fertilization) after two years from conversion due to the increased available P and inorganic-N, and sufficient soil moisture restoration at 0-0.6 m depath. SOC in RC decreased by 8.1% over the 9 years, while RCF consistently kept SOC levels up to those of pre-conversion alfalfa pasture. These findings help to eliminate concerns about the continuously low production and rapid decline of SOC in croplands converted from alfalfa and suggest ways to support sustainable high-productivity and high SOC sequestration in dryland farming.

J	Wang, J; Xie, YW; Wang, XY; Guo, KM				Wang, Ju; Xie, Yaowen; Wang, Xiaoyun; Guo, Kunming			Driving Factors of Recent Vegetation Changes in Hexi Region, Northwest China Based on a New Classification Framework	REMOTE SENSING												Since other factors (soil properties, topography, etc.) under natural conditions are relatively invariant over one or two decades, climate variables (precipitation and temperature) and human activities are the two fundamental factors driving vegetation changes in global or large-scale areas. However, the combined effects of either single climatic factor and human activities on vegetation changes and the role of human activities itself in a specific region has not been fully discussed. In this study, the Hexi region, a typical dryland consisting of three inland river basins in northwest China was selected as a case area. A new classification framework combining Pearson correlation analysis and residual trend approach was proposed to assess their individual and conjoint contributions of climate variables and human activities in areas of significant vegetation changes. Our results indicated that most of vegetation covered areas in the Hexi region experienced significant changes during the period 2001-2017, and vegetation improvements were widespread except the interior of oases; significant changes in vegetation caused by human activities, precipitation, the interactions of precipitation and human activities, temperature, the interactions of temperature and human activities, the interactions of temperature and precipitation, and the interactions of the three factors accounted for 50.46%, 16.39%, 19.90%, 4.33%, 2.32%, 2.11%, and 4.49% of the total change areas, respectively. Generally, the influence of temperature was relatively weaker than that of precipitation, and the contributions of the interactions of climate variables and human activities on vegetation changes were greater than that of climate contributions alone. Moreover, the results of various investigations, according to the trends and the time of vegetation changes, indicate that decreasing trends of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the Hexi region were chiefly attributed to the adjustments of agricultural planting structure while the comprehensive treatment programs implemented in river basins supported a large proportion of vegetation improvements.

Photodegradation influences litter decomposition rate in a humid tropical ecosystem, Brazil	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Solar radiation in general and UV radiation in particular have been recognized to stimulate plant litter decomposition through photochemical mineralization of organic molecules such as lignin and through facilitation of microbial decomposition in dryland ecosystems. However, little is known about how photodegradation may influence decomposition in other ecosystems not subject to moisture limitations and under what conditions photodegradation may be favored. Decomposition in humid tropical ecosystems is a complex process, and it can be influenced by a number of environmental factors that are distinct from arid and semi-arid ecosystems. To assess the mechanisms underlying photodegradation by ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation in a humid tropical ecosystem, we designed a 300-day field experiment in a tropical site in Brazil with high levels of annual precipitation, compared to arid ecosystems, and exposed litter to three levels of radiation (full sun, UV-B removed, and shade) combined with a biocide treatment. Results show that after nearly one year of exposure, the microbial biomass was not affected by UV-B incidence, and this effect has not yet been fully understood for tropical ecosystems. Modeled using an exponential deceleration equation, the removal of UV-B radiation decelerated the plant litter decomposition rate for the control conditions by 21% compared to litter exposed to full sun. Interestingly, shaded litter exhibited similar mass loss compared to litter exposed to full sun. Furthermore, differences in the decay constant among radiation treatments due to the UV-B effect were independent of lignin loss. Overall, our study suggests that UV-B radiation contributed to plant litter decomposition through carbon losses but had no discernible effect on nitrogen, lignin, or cellulose loss specifically. Importantly, our results demonstrate that photodegradation occurs under humid tropical conditions, and further studies are necessary to examine the mechanisms of carbon loss.

Potential climate change adaptation strategies for winter wheat production in the Texas High Plains	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Winter wheat is one of the major crops in the Texas High Plains (THP) region, which is facing challenges from climate change (CC) and exhausting irrigation water supplies from the Ogallala Aquifer. The goal of this study was to assess the impacts of CC on winter wheat production in the THP and evaluate potential adaptation strategies using the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) CERES-Wheat model. A thorough calibration of the model against field data resulted in a satisfactory simulation of phenology, leaf area index, grain yield (percent error, |PE| < 4.7%), biomass (|PE| < 7.1%), and evapotranspiration (|PE| < 11.9%). The evaluated model was then used for: (i) predicting winter wheat yield and irrigation water use, and (ii) evaluating six potential winter wheat cultivars under CC at three sites in the THP. Mixed trends were found for irrigated yield in the future across the study sites due to differences in climate and soils. Irrigation water use of winter wheat is expected to decrease in the future due to improved water use efficiency at elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and reduced growing season length due to temperature rise. Dryland yield is expected to increase due to improved crop water use efficiency. Among the virtual cultivars tested for CC adaptation, increasing potential number of grains and vigorous root system were found to be the most desirable traits, since these cultivars had higher yield and lower or comparable irrigation water use than the reference cultivar. Long-maturity and stay-green cultivars were found to be not advisable due to significantly higher irrigation water use than the reference cultivar. Overall, the results showed that winter wheat production in the THP could benefit from CC under milder climatic conditions (mean growing season temperature < 13 degrees C). Enhancing yield potential traits and root architecture should be considered for screening cultivars for CC adaptation.

Influence of climate, post-treatment weather extremes, and soil factors on vegetation recovery after restoration treatments in the southwestern US	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Aims Understanding the conditions associated with dryland vegetation recovery after restoration treatments is challenging due to a lack of monitoring data and high environmental variability over time and space. Tracking recovery trajectories with satellite-based vegetation indices can strengthen predictions of restoration outcomes across broad areas with varying environmental conditions. Location Southwestern United States. Methods We quantified the recovery trajectories of spring and summer soil-adjusted total vegetation index (SATVI) for 5-10 year periods following post-wildfire seeding or prescribed burns for 241 treatment sites and related SATVI to ground-based vegetation cover. We modeled SATVI based on time since treatment, yearly temperature and precipitation, weather extremes following treatment, soil available water capacity, invasive species presence, and treatment type. We also tested for the effects of environmental variables on trajectories, by examining interactions with years post-treatment. Results Ground-based vegetation cover and SATVI were highly correlated. Most treatment sites had positive recovery rates for spring (82%) and summer (85%) SATVI. Several environmental variables affected vegetation recovery trajectories as indicated by interactions with time since treatment. Yearly warm season precipitation had a positive effect on SATVI recovery that increased over time, whereas the positive effect of extreme high warm season precipitation following treatment decreased over time for both seasons of vegetation measurements. For spring SATVI, the positive effect of cool season yearly precipitation increased over time while the negative effect of extreme high temperatures following treatment became more negative over time. Invasive species presence led to higher spring, but not summer, SATVI. Conclusions Satellite-based remote sensing is a promising tool to assess vegetation recovery following restoration treatments, particularly when it is combined with ground-based monitoring. Our results suggest that weather extremes following restoration treatments can affect vegetation recovery trajectories and may be considered in management decisions such as the timing of restoration treatments.

J	Mesfin, S; Haileselassie, H				Mesfin, Shimbahri; Haileselassie, Hailay			Evaluation of soil physico-chemical properties as affected by canopies of scattered agroforestry trees on croplands	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PLANT AND SOIL												Agroforestry tree species play an important role in improving soil fertility. Though studies have confirmed that different species show different potentials to improve soil fertility, it is difficult to compare them as the studies were conducted in different areas. The potential for different tree species to improve soil fertility on croplands in northern Ethiopia is not known. The objectives of this paper are to determine the effects of presence or absence of agroforestry tree species on soil physico-chemical properties and the effect of distance from the tree trunk on the same soil physico-chemical properties. Sixty composite and undisturbed soil samples from beneath canopies and outside canopies and 90 composite and undisturbed soil samples from three different distances from tree trunks were collected. The results revealed that soil bulk density, soil moisture, soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (Av.P), exchangeable potassium (Exch.K) and soil organic carbon stock (SOCS) were significantly (p < 0.05) different between soils beneath canopies and outside canopies as well as at different distances from the tree trunk. Soils around these agroforestry tree species have increased SOC, TN, Av.P, Exch.K and SOCS by 11.9 to 91.5%, 22.2 to 125.0%, 31 to 71%, 32 to 151.6% and 15.2 to 90.9%, respectively, compared to soils outside tree canopies. Faidherbia albida (Delile) A.Chev. has the highest potential for soil fertility compared to Balanites aegyptiaca (L.) Delile, Cordia africana Lam., Ziziphus spina-christi (L.) Desf., Acacia sieberiana DC and Croton macrostachyus Hochst. ex Delile. This study could provide useful information for soil fertility management and farmers' decision-making when selecting tree species. The findings of this study imply that scattered trees on croplands significantly improve soil fertility and reduce the need for external fertiliser inputs.

The TR response to transiently increasing VPD (0.9-4.1 kPa) and the transpiration and leaf area expansion response to progressive soil drying were measured in controlled conditions at early vegetative stage in 10-16 genotypes of each species grown in moderate or high vapor pressure deficit (VPD) conditions. Maize grown under moderate VPD conditions restricted TR under high VPD, but not sorghum and pearl millet. By contrast, when grown under high VPD, all species increased TR upon increasing VPD, suggesting a loss of TR responsiveness. Sorghum and pearl-millet grown under high VPD reduced leaf area, but not maize. Upon progressive soil drying, maize reduced transpiration at higher soil moisture than sorghum and pearl millet, especially under high VPD, and leaf area expansion declined at similar or lower soil moisture than transpiration in maize and sorghum. It is concluded that maize conserves water by restricting transpiration upon increasing VPD and under higher soil moisture than sorghum and millet, giving maize significantly higher TE, whereas sorghum and pearl millet rely mostly on reduced leaf area and somewhat on transpiration restriction.

J	Qiu, RA; Han, G; Li, SW; Tian, F; Ma, X; Gong, W				Qiu, Ruonan; Han, Ge; Li, Siwei; Tian, Feng; Ma, Xin; Gong, Wei			Soil moisture dominates the variation of gross primary productivity during hot drought in drylands	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The frequency and severity of hot drought will increase in the future due to impact of climate change and human activities, threatening the sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems and human societies. Hot drought is a typical type of drought event, high vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and low soil moisture (SM) are its main characteristics of hot drought, with increasing water stress on vegetation and exacerbating hydrological drought and ecosystem risks. However, our understanding of the effects of high VPD and low SM on vegetation productivity is limited, because these two variables are strongly coupled and influenced by other climatic drivers. The southwestern United States experienced one of the most severe hot drought events on record in 2020. In this study, we used SM and gross primary productivity (GPP) datasets from Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP), as well as VPD and other meteorological datasets from gridMET. We decoupled the effects of different meteorological factors on GPP at monthly and daily scales using partial correlation analysis, partial least squares regression, and binning methods. We found that SM anomalies contribute more to GPP anomalies than VPD anomalies at monthly and daily scales. Especially at the daily scale, as the decoupled SM anomalies increased, the GPP anomalies increased. However, there is no significant change in GPP anomalies as VPD increases. For all the vegetation types and arid zones, SM dominated the variation in GPP, followed by VPD or maximum temperature. At the flux tower scale, decoupled soil water content (SWC) also dominated changes in GPP, compared to VPD. In the next century, hot drought will occur frequently in dryland regions, where GPP is one of the highest uncertainties in terrestrial ecosystems. Our study has important implications for identifying the strong coupling of meteorological factors and their impact on vegetation under climate change.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				NOV 15	2023	899								165686	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165686	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165686		JUL 2023						37482354					WOS:001050175600001

At the xeric timberline, we observed the tree-to-shrub shift of the Quercus mongolica Fisch. ex Ledeb.. Few studies have explored the underlined mechanism of this morphological transition of tree-to-shrub in arid regions. To examine whether the tree-to-shrub shift affects carbohydrate allocation and to verify the effect of life stage on non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) storage, we measured the concentration of soluble sugar and starch of Q. mongolica in the seedlings, saplings, and adult trees by selecting two sites with either tree or shrub growth forms of Q. mongolica at the driest area of its distribution. Accordingly, there was no significant difference in the radial growth with different growth forms (p > 0.05). The results showed that the effects of growth form on NSC concentrations are significant in the seedling and sapling stages, but become less pronounced as Q. mongolica grows. The results of the linear mixed model showed that life stage has a significant effect on soluble sugar concentration of tree-form (p < 0.05), starch and TNC concentration of shrub-form (p < 0.05). Compared with a shrub form without seedling stage, a tree form needs to accumulate more soluble sugar from seedling stage to adapt to arid environment. Saplings and adult shrubs store more starch, especially in thick roots, in preparation for sprout regeneration. Our study shows that the same species with tree and shrub forms embody differentiated carbohydrate allocation strategies, suggesting that shrub form can better adapt to a drier habitat, and the tree-to-shrub shift can benefit the expansion of woody species distribution in dryland.					li, xiang/JCN-9316-2023	Liu, Hongyan/0000-0002-6721-4439														1999-4907				NOV	2022	13	11							1745	10.3390/f13111745	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f13111745													WOS:000882648900001

However, the consistent or opposite effects on NH3 and N2O emissions caused by adding exogenous urea in this process have not been fully considered. Here, we controlled the initial (slow drying) and final (adding water) water-filled pore space (WFPS) at 70%, 60%, or 50% through microculture experiment to simulate a process of slow drying-fertilization and rapid wetting of the soil from rice harvest to dryland crop fertilization. Through measuring soil chemical properties and the abundance and composition of related microbial communities during drying process, we studied the pathways of influence of drying and rewetting on the emission of N2O and NH3 after urea application. During the progressive drying process (WFPS decreasing from 70% to 60% and 50%), soil N2O and NH3 emissions decreased by 49.77%-72.13% and 17.89%-42.19%, respectively. After rapid rewetting (WFPS increasing from 60% to 70%, 50%-60% and 70%), N2O emissions showed a slight increase, while NH3 volatilization continued to decrease. Soil NH+4 - N and DOC contents both decreased during progressive drying, while the soil NO-3 - N content was enhanced. The drying process changed the community structure of ureC and amoA-b and reduced their abundance but had no effect on amoA-a, nirK or nirS. Correlation analysis indicated that the reductions in NH+4 - N content and the abundances of ureC and amoA-b were the main factors suppressing N2O and NH3 emissions. We believe that drying process limits the related microbial activity and substrate supply during ammonia oxidation process in terms of N2O emissions, while in terms of NH3 volatilization, it reduces the related microbial activity of urea hydrolysis process and increases the ammonium adsorption to the soil.

To determine the optimum dose of N for maize planting system, we analysed the relationship between yield and emissions of GHGs at seven levels of N, namely 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, and 350 kg ha(-1), using the DNDC (denitrification decomposition) model and maize grown with and without mulching. The model simulated the following variables: maize production; emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4); global warming potential (GWP); and GHG intensity (GHGI). We used data from 1980 to 2013 for a rain-fed region of the Loess Plateau in north-western China and validated the DNDC model against data from field experiments. The model performed well in simulating yield and GHG emissions (Adj.R-2 > 0.61). Under mulching, the average yield of maize was 3.6-12.2 t ha(-1) and the partial factor productivity was 73.1-35.0 kg kg(-1); and both of these were significantly higher 78%-236% than those in the crop without mulching. The emissions of CO2, N2O, and the GWP increased with the increase in the dose of N whereas CH4 emissions remained unaffected by the dose. Mulching increased yields significantly in the north-western region, and the GWP and GHGI were higher mainly in the central and north-western regions. The optimum dose of N for maize grown with mulching ranged between 150 kg ha(-1) and 200 kg ha(-1) and offers the best balance between higher yield and lower emissions. The optimum dose may promote the development of mulched maize and provide a reference standard for dryland agriculture in zones with similar climates elsewhere in the world.

Mangrove Forest Cover and Phenology with Landsat Dense Time Series in Central Queensland, Australia	REMOTE SENSING												Wetlands are one of the most biologically productive ecosystems. Wetland ecosystem services, ranging from provision of food security to climate change mitigation, are enormous, far outweighing those of dryland ecosystems per hectare. However, land use change and water regulation infrastructure have reduced connectivity in many river systems and with floodplain and estuarine wetlands. Mangrove forests are critical communities for carbon uptake and storage, pollution control and detoxification, and regulation of natural hazards. Although the clearing of mangroves in Australia is strictly regulated, Great Barrier Reef catchments have suffered landscape modifications and hydrological alterations that can kill mangroves. We used remote sensing datasets to investigate land cover change and both intra- and inter-annual seasonality in mangrove forests in a large estuarine region of Central Queensland, Australia, which encompasses a national park and Ramsar Wetland, and is adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage site. We built a time series using spectral, auxiliary, and phenology variables with Landsat surface reflectance products, accessed in Google Earth Engine. Two land cover classes were generated (mangrove versus non-mangrove) in a Random Forest classification. Mangroves decreased by 1480 hectares (-2.31%) from 2009 to 2019. The overall classification accuracies and Kappa coefficient for 2008-2010 and 2018-2020 land cover maps were 95% and 95%, respectively. Using an NDVI-based time series we examined intra- and inter-annual seasonality with linear and harmonic regression models, and second with TIMESAT metrics of mangrove forests in three sections of our study region. Our findings suggest a relationship between mangrove growth phenology along with precipitation anomalies and severe tropical cyclone occurrence over the time series. The detection of responses to extreme events is important to improve understanding of the connections between climate, extreme weather events, and biodiversity in estuarine and mangrove ecosystems.

We tested the hypothesis that landscapes with intermediate structure complexity (i.e., those that combine natural vegetation and human-transformed ecosystems) are the most efficient to produce food, water and energy for local populations in Caatinga, South America's largest dryland. We used empirical data and computer simulations to simultaneously assess the trade-offs between the production of these three ecosystem services and the landscape structure. The results supported the hypothesis. Moreover, we found that increasing the percentage of natural lands in the landscape increased the production of biomass energy, water and food. However, water production stabilized when natural lands occupied more than 80 % of the landscape, and food production decreased when natural lands occupied more than 50 % of the landscape. Increasing the percentage of agricultural land in the landscape increased the production of all three ecosystem services, but biomass energy production and water production declined when agricultural lands reached 20 % and 35 % of the landscape, respectively. Finally, the production of all three ecosystem services declined when the percentage of degraded lands (i.e., lands that lost most of their natural productivity due to human-caused processes) in the landscape increased, but food production declined faster than the production of energy and water. To achieve groundwater, food, and long-term energy security, agricultural landscapes in tropical drylands require more conservation (including the restoration of degraded areas), more diversification of agriculture practices, and a better integration of individual initiatives at a larger spatial scale.y					Alvarado, Fredy/AAK-3434-2021; Vasconcellos, Alexandre/GNW-5099-2022; Araújo, Lenyneves Duarte Alvino/GLT-6657-2022; da Silva, José Maria Cardoso/K-3479-2016; Santos, Bráulio A./M-2582-2013; Vasconcellos, Alexandre/I-4115-2012; Araujo, Helder/I-1218-2012; M.

Numerical simulation of water- and heat-flow regimes of mulched soil in rain-fed soybean field in central Japan	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Numerical simulations for predicting soil-water and heat-flow regimes beneath mulched soils are important to increase the opportunity for efficient use of mulching in agriculture. This study simulated water and heat flows by HYDRUS-1D model under rice-straw mulching and bare soil treatments for rain-fed soybean (Glycine max) cultivation at Gifu Prefecture in central Japan. Soil hydraulic and thermal parameters with the straw mulching were optimized by adding a hypothetical 3-cm straw layer. The optimized parameters were validated with field-measured soil-moisture and temperature regimes of two consecutive soybean-growing seasons of 2015 and 2016. HYDRUS-1D model performed fairly well in simulating heat and water movements at 5, 15 and 25 cm soil depths under the two treatments. The model simulated soil moisture and temperature with small Root-Mean Square Error (RMSE): 0.016-0.044 cm(3) cm(-3) for soil moisture and 0.94-1.63 degrees C for soil temperature. The simulation results revealed that straw mulching increased soil moisture but reduced soil temperature at the three soil depths compared to the bare soil. The moisture content of the additional straw layer (3 cm) and heat flow through it showed a decreasing pattern compared to the soil layers. The straw mulching contributed 16-96% vapor to the total water flow and stored/released 0.0322 to 0.0295 MJ m(-2) heat per day at 0-3 cm straw layer. Water balance in the soybean field revealed that the straw layer enhanced rain water infiltration by limiting evaporation from the soil surface. The simulation results can be useful for better management of soil hydro-thermal regimes under straw-mulched fields in dryland cultivations.

Reducing the leakage of CO2 bundle sheath cells and improving the photosynthesis capacity and gas exchange characteristics of soybean leaves will contribute to increase yield under the dryland agricultural system and provide a scientific basis. Therefore, during 2019 and 2020, soybean exposed to different cultivation modes to analyze the response curves of photosynthesis and CO2 under different deficit irrigation strategies. In this study, we used two cultivation models: RB: ridge covered with biodegradable film and furrow area not covered; CF: conventional flat land planting under four deficit irrigation modes (R: rainwater irrigation; IB: branch stage irrigation (220 mm); IP: Irrigation during podding (220 mm); IBP: branch stage irrigation (110 mm), podding stage irrigation (110 mm). Compared with CF-IBP treatment, RB-IBP had significant effects on rainwater collection, SWS, and soybean yield. Photo-response curve analysis showed that RB-IBP treatment a significant increase in Pn, Gs, Ci, Tr, leaf WUE, and chlorophyll ab content. Under different irrigation strategies, maximum net photosynthetic rate (Pnmax), light saturation point (LSP), and apparent quantum efficiency under RB-IBP treatment (alpha), Pn under respiration rate and CO2 response curve were significantly higher than that under CF cultivation mode. Compared with RB culture mode under different irrigation strategies, CF cultivation mode significantly increases Delta C-13 and CO2 sheath cell leakage (phi); it also led to a significant decline in the ratio of Ci/Ca concentration. This study shows that RB-IBP treatment is the best water-saving strategy because it means reducing the leakage of CO2 from the bundle sheath, thus significantly increasing soil water storage, photosynthetic capacity, and soybean yield.

The effects of shrub encroachment on nitrogen cycling have been investigated at the site scale but seldomly conducted at the landscape scale. Here, we selected 43 shrubland sites distributing across 3000 km(2) area in temperate desert grassland in eastern Yanchi County of Ningxia Hui Autonomous. We investigated the spatial heterogeneity and driving factors of soil total nitrogen (STN) at the landscape scale by using geostatistical analysis and the geographical detector method. Our results showed that the average soil total nitrogen decreased in the order of 0-5 cm (0.21 g kg(-1)) > 5-15 cm (0.19 g kg(-1)) > 15-40 cm (0.18 g kg(-1)). Geostatistical analysis showed that soil total nitrogen exhibited the strong spatial autocorrelation in the 0-5 and 5-15 cm soil layers and the moderate spatial autocorrelation in the 15-40 cm soil layer. Furthermore, the geographic detector method indicated that soil physicochemical properties exhibited the stronger effects than these of topographic and vegetation biomass in determining the spatial distribution of soil total nitrogen. Specifically, soil water content in the 0-20 cm soil layer explained 35% of variation in soil total nitrogen spatial pattern in the 0-5 cm soil layer, while soil organic carbon content in the 15-40 cm soil layer explained 64% and 45% of variation in soil total nitrogen spatial patterns in the 5-15 cm and 15-40 cm soil layers, respectively. It was concluded that soil water content and organic carbon content primarily drove the formation of soil total nitrogen spatial heterogeneity in shrubland at the landscape scale, indicating that anthropogenic shrub encroachment evidently affected soil water content and redistribution in dryland.					wang, wenjuan/JGD-0428-2023; chen, yuying/JNS-9778-2023; Jiang, Yu/JEZ-9814-2023; 赵, 亚楠/HJA-9389-2022; wang, wei/JBS-7400-2023; Chen, Xin/JDN-2017-2023; liu, junyang/IXD-1252-2023; Zhang, Lijun/JEZ-7925-2023; Li, Fan/JRY-4017-2023; Zhang, Jing/HII-4294-2022; WANG, HUI/JFA-9683-2023; Liu, Yujie/IWU-6535-2023; wang, yu/IUQ-6654-2023; Yang, Jie/JDM-6213-2023; xuan, li/JNI-7432-2023; liu, junyang/IXD-1201-2023; Yang, Tian/JFB-1008-2023; Yan, Jing/JFA-6705-2023; Wu, Lijuan/JJG-0701-2023	赵, 亚楠/0000-0001-6095-1914; Liu, Yujie/0000-0002-1153-6156; Yang, Jie/0000-0002-3941-0053; 														2296-665X				JAN 4	2023	10								1058344	10.3389/fenvs.2022.1058344	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.1058344													WOS:000917159200001

Using three diverse cropping systems studies (Site 1, long-term cotton [Gossypium hirsutum L.]-cover crop systems; Site 2, short-term cotton-cover crop systems; and Site 3, transitional organic wheat [Triticum aestivum L.] system), our research objective was to quantify and compare BNF and associated parameters among four cool-season legumes (Austrian winter pea [Pisum sativum subsp. Arvense], hairy vetch [Vicia villosa], crimson clover [Trifolium incarnatum], and lentil [Lens culinaris]) in different settings. At Sites 1 and 2, winter pea had growth of 2.73 to 3.44 Mg ha(-1), the greatest percent N derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa; 57.2-72.6%) and, depending on site, the greatest level of BNF (67-74 kg N ha(-1)). Results from the organic system (Site 3) demonstrated winter pea was also productive in growth and BNF when intercropped with wheat in N-poor soil, with exceptionally high %Ndfa (92.7%). Hairy vetch and lentil differed in growth and %Ndfa, but had comparable BNF (46-51 kg N ha(-1)) at Sites 1 and 2. Growth of crimson clover was poor. This data provides insights on how cool-season legumes differ in BNF in the TRP in a year when legume growth was average for the region. The TRP has a volatile climate, however, indicating further study is needed to fully understand the BNF benefit cool-season legumes can provide in the region.

However, patterns of energy exchange and evapotranspiration (ET) are not well understood in the oasis-desert ecotone, which plays an important role in protecting oases against the threat of desertification in arid regions of northwestern China. Here, the continuous measurements of surface energy fluxes were made using eddy covariance in conjunction with auxiliary measurements for 2 years (2014-2015) in an oasis-desert ecotone mainly covered by phreatophyte shrubs Haloxylon ammodendron, Nitraria tangutorum/sphaerocarpa, and Calligonum mongolicum in arid northwestern China. Based on the collated data for 2 years, statistical analysis on a 30-min time scale indicated that approximately 50% of daytime net radiation (R-n) in the ecotone was dissipated as H on average, and one-third of R-n was consumed by soil heat flux (G). Only 9% of R-n was consumed for latent heat flux (lambda E), which peaked in summer (21% in 2014 and 16% in 2015), corresponding to the highest rainfall season. Daily mean ET was approximately 1 mm days(-1) during the growing season of the shrub species. Accumulated annual ET was 195 and 181 mm in 2014 and 2015, respectively, exceeding the corresponding precipitation (P) by approximately 87 and 77 mm, indicating that groundwater may be another important source of water for ET in the ecotone aside from rainfall. Results within provide valuable insights into the mechanisms responsible for sustaining energy and water balance in the ecotone, a potentially groundwater-dependent ecosystem. These results also offer a foremost ecohydrological implication for water and land resources management and ecotone conservation, such as avoiding heavy groundwater pumping for extensive agricultural irrigation use to sustain groundwater availability for these shrub species in the ecotone.

Land use transition forms a complex network comprised of different land use types which interact with each other and respond to external environment processes, resulting in dynamics. This study develops complex network approach with cascade failure model to quantitatively explore the effects of land use transition on ecological vulnerability from the holistic and dynamic perspective. The study analyzes the characteristics of land use transition, identifying key transition types and simulating their impact on ecological vulnerability in 16 poverty-stricken mountainous counties in western Hubei Province, China, with the following findings. (1) The heterogeneity of change in agricultural land and construction land is significant; from 1990 to 2015, a short-term increase in the amount of agricultural land is followed by a gradual reduction, while the amount of construction land increased continuously. (2) Agricultural land is the dominant output land type, exported mainly to construction land and water area, and construction land is the dominant input land type, imported mainly from agricultural land. Sparse woods, woods, and dryland are the key land use types in the study area. (3) the critical points for maintaining resilience of ecosystem are 80% or higher for cultivated land and 80% or higher for woodland. (4) For the tolerance parameter alpha, 20% increase in cultivated land and a 10% increase in woodland would enhance ecosystem resilience and reduce its damage degree to corresponding land use transition. These findings are important points of reference for the sustainable management of povertystricken mountainous counties in western Hubei Province and in China more generally. They also have policy implications for land resources, especially in terms of the alleviation of poverty and the coordination between ecological protection and economic development.					wang, ying/ABG-8215-2020; Xiao, Renbin/N-5136-2018	wang, ying/0000-0001-5868-5661; Xiao, Renbin/0000-0003-0951-2734													0301-4797	1095-8630				NOV 1	2021	297								113206	10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113206	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113206		JUL 2021						34325371					WOS:000691647700006

Effect of Nitrogen and Seeding Rate on β-Glucan, Protein, and Grain Yield of Naked Food Barley in No-Till Cropping Systems in the Palouse Region of the Pacific Northwest	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS												Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) has a storied history as a food crop, and it has long been a dietary staple of peoples in temperate climates. Contemporary research studies have focused mostly on hulled barley for malt and animal feed. As such, nitrogen (N) and seeding rate agronomic data for naked food barley are lacking. In this study, we evaluated the effects of N on ss-glucan and protein content, and N and seeding rate on phenotypic characteristics of naked food barley, including grain yield, emergence, plant height, days to heading, days to maturity, test weight, percent plump kernels, and percent thin kernels. Experiments were conducted at two no-till farms, located in Almota, WA, and Genesee, ID, in the Palouse region of the Pacific Northwest from 2016 to 2018. The experiment comprised two varieties ("Havener" and "Julie"), employed N rates of 0, 62, 95, 129, and 162 kg N ha(-1), and seeding rates of 250, 310, and 375 seeds/m(-2). Increased N fertilization rate was shown to significantly increase all response variables, except beta-glucan content of the variety Julie, days to heading, test weight, and percent plump and thin kernels. Increased N fertilization resulted in higher mean grain yield of Havener and Julie in both Almota and Genesee up to 95 kg N ha(-1). Havener had higher yields (3,908 kg N ha(-1)) than Julie (3,099 kg N ha(-1)) across locations and years. Julie had higher beta-glucan (8.2%) and protein (12.6%) content compared to Havener (beta-glucan = 6.6%; protein = 9.1%). Our results indicate that beta-glucan content is associated with genotype, environmental, and agronomic factors in dryland cropping systems of the Palouse.

Life under quartz: Hypolithic mosses in the Mojave Desert	PLOS ONE												Several species of dryland cyanobacteria are known to occur as hypoliths under semi-translucent rocks. In the Mojave Desert, these organisms find refuge from intense solar radiation under milky quartz where moisture persists for a longer period of time than in adjacent soil surface habitat. Desert mosses, which are extremely desiccation-tolerant, can also occur in these hypolithic spaces, though little is known about this unique moss microhabitat and how species composition compares to that of adjacent soil surface communities. To address this question, we deployed microclimate dataloggers and collected moss samples from under and adjacent to 18 milky quartz rocks (quartz mean center thickness 26 +/- 15 mm) in a western high elevation Mojave Desert site. Light transmission through Mojave quartz rocks may be as low as 1.2%, and data from microclimate loggers deployed for five months support the hypothesis that quartz provides thermal buffering and higher relative humidity compared to the soil surface. Of the 53 samples collected from hypolith and surface microhabitats, 68% wereSyntrichia caninervis, the dominant bryophyte of the Mojave Desert biological soil crust.Tortula inermisaccounted for 28% of the samples and 4% wereBryum argenteum. In a comparison of moss community composition, we found thatS.caninerviswas more likely to be on the soil surface, though it was abundant in both microhabitats, whileT.inermiswas more restricted to hypoliths, perhaps due to protection from temperature extremes. In our study site, the differences between hypolithic and surface microhabitats enable niche partitioning betweenT.inermisandS.caninervis, enhancing alpha diversity. This work points to the need to thoroughly consider microhabitats when assessing bryophyte species diversity and modelling species distributions. This focus is particularly important in extreme environments, where mosses may find refuge from the prevailing macroclimatic conditions in microhabitats such as hypoliths.

Introducing legumes into semi-arid agricultural systems as intercrops improves soil quality due to biological nitrogen fixation and reduced wind erosion as a result of better soil cover, but the consequences of introducing legumes for the water use efficiency of the crop system are less predictable. Here we carried out field experiments from 2014 to 2017 in Inner Mongolia, China. We compared a rotational intercropping system of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) and hairy vetch (Vida villosa) with monocultures of potato and hairy vetch and quantified crop yield, water use efficiency and land productivity. While the relative density (the ratio of plant density in intercrop and the density in sole stand) of both crops in the intercropping was 0.5, the average relative yield of the potato over four years was 0.43, but that of the vetch was 0.87, indicating dominance of the vetch in the intercropping system. Land and water equivalent ratios, defined as the area of land or amount of water that would be needed in single cropping to achieve the same yield as in intercropping, averaged to 1.30 and 1.29 over the years, respectively, indicating high relative land and water productivity of potato/hairy vetch intercropping compared to monocultures. Vetch was a stronger competitor for water than potato with a partial water equivalent ratio of 0.83. We conclude that the potato/vetch intercropping system improves land productivity and system level water use efficiency under the rain-fed semi-arid conditions of the study site. These results are useful to optimize cropping systems for regional sustainability with consideration of both arable crop production (potato) and provision of fodder for animal husbandry (vetch).					ren, jianhong/IUM-4351-2023; Zhang, Yanchao/JMB-7717-2023; wu, yi/JEP-1581-2023; van der Werf, Wopke/A-2557-2009	van der Werf, Wopke/0000-0002-5506-4699; Zhang, Lizhen/0000-0003-1606-6824; Ren, Jianhong/0009-0008-3202-3756; Evers, Jochem/0000-0002-3956-0190													0378-4290	1872-6852				JUL 1	2019	240						168	176		10.1016/j.fcr.2018.12.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2018.12.002													WOS:000483411700017

Agronomic Practices for Reducing Wheat Yield Gaps: A Quantitative Appraisal of Progressive Producers	CROP SCIENCE												There is limited information on agronomic practices affecting wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield in intensively managed dryland systems despite the opportunity to narrow the existing yield gap (Y-G). We used a unique database of 100 intensively managed field pp entered in the Kansas Wheat Yield Contest during the 2010 to 2017 harvest seasons to (i) quantify the Y-G, (ii) describe wheat management, and (iii) identify management opportunities and weather patterns associated with yield. We simulated wheat water-limited yield (Y-W) using Simple Simulation Modeling Wheat (SSM-Wheat) model for each field-year to estimate Y-G as the difference between Y and actual yield (Y-a) and used 11 statistical approaches to test the association of management practices and weather variables with Ya. Wheat Ya averaged 5.5 Mg ha(-1), and simulated Y-w averaged 6.4 Mg ha(-1), resulting in a Y-G of 0.9 Mg ha(-1) (15% of Y-W). High-yielding fields had lower maximum and minimum temperatures and greater cumulative solar radiation and precipitation during grain fill. Varieties susceptible to fungal diseases responded to foliar fungicide (0.8-1.4 Mg ha(-1)), whereas resistant varieties did not. Seeding rate was negatively associated with Ya, as yield quantile 0.99 was 7.5 Mg ha(-1) and decreased by 2.7 Mg ha(-1) for every 100-seed m(-2) increase in seeding rate above 305 seeds m(-2). In-furrow P fertilizer, previous crop, tillage practice, and N timing were also associated with Y-a. We conclude that fields entered in yield contests have closed the exploitable Y-G, and there are opportunities to improve Y-a through improved management in regions with stagnant wheat yield.

The spectral characteristics of organic matter replace the mineral elements as prominent features. In this case, the growth patterns and spectral characteristics of biological soil crusts (BSCs) can be observed. Satellite spectral data have been used for BSC spatial information extraction. However, the dynamic changes in BSCs can affect the spectra. Two aspects are involved here: moisture change and BSC growth. When these changes are superimposed with BSC succession, they lead to an increase in spectral complexity. This study explored three BSC types, including algal crust, lichen and moss, and discussed their spectra. By selecting BSC samples at different succession states and by combining coverage and simulated precipitation, the response of the spectra to BSC coverage and the spectral characteristics of BSCs under dry and wet conditions were measured and analysed. In addition, the spectral index variations caused by coverage and moisture of three types of BSCs were discussed, where the spectral indices include the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), brightness index (BI), crust index (CI), and biological soil crust index (BSCI). The results showed that the succession, moisture and growth of BSCs were the main factors affecting their spectra. BSC types can be distinguished in a particular climatic context to determine the degree of BSC succession. Precipitation in the monitoring areas needs to be considered to avoid the effects of dry and wet BSC variations on remote sensing monitoring. The coverage of different types of BSCs in mixed pixels can be determined by multiple indices. The results of this study will provide a basis for monitoring BSCs using satellite spectral information to guide regional ecological management.

J	Craw, D; Rufaut, C; Pillai, D				Craw, Dave; Rufaut, Cathy; Pillai, Dhana			Evolution of Alkaline Mine Drainage and Unique Biodiversity on Soil-Free Mine Substrates, Southern New Zealand	MINE WATER AND THE ENVIRONMENT												Relatively impermeable soil-free substrates (clay-rich outcrops and sediments) exposed at eight abandoned placer gold mines generate alkaline mine drainage through evaporation and minor interaction between water and rock in a semi-arid rain shadow climate. Original mine sluicing a century ago created drainage channels over the land surface that still control the flow of ephemeral surface waters, with localised construction of erosional outwash pans. Ephemeral surface waters and associated evaporitic salts are dominated by halite derived from marine aerosols in rain, yielding circumneutral pH and electrical conductivity (EC) values locally exceeding 50 mS/cm. Weakly altered schist basement rocks and Miocene mudstone exposed at the surface contain abundant calcite, and surface waters are supersaturated with respect to Ca-carbonate minerals with a pH of approximate to 8 and an EC of approximate to 1 mS/cm. Water interaction with albite increases the dissolved Na/Cl molar ratio to > 1, and evaporative formation of Na-carbonate precipitates can raise the pH to > 10. Pyrite oxidation does not offset the alkaline pH in any of these processes, although dissolved sulfate can rise to high levels (> 2000 mg/L; EC approximate to 5 mS/cm), forming evaporative sulfate minerals. Ephemeral waters drain down outcrops and the relatively impermeable erosional pans, leaving salt encrustations with variable mineralogy and associated waters with pH and EC values that are partially controlled by rates of dissolution and reprecipitation of the minerals in the salts. The saline alkaline chemistry of the pans excludes most vegetation and has allowed development of salt-tolerant ecosystems with rare endemic halophytic plants. Maintenance of soil-free halophytic surfaces has potential applications in dryland mine sites around the world, especially as climate change enhances and extends aridity.																			1025-9112	1616-1068				MAR	2023	42	1					3	23		10.1007/s10230-023-00913-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10230-023-00913-x		JAN 2023											WOS:000916611500002

Organic fertilizers can not only reduce the use of nitrogen (N) fertilizers by increasing soil organic matter but are also safe for the environment. The partial replacement of nitrogen (N) fertilizers with organic fertilizers can potentially reduce N2O emissions. To illuminate the best ratio for the nitrogen replacement of inorganic fertilizer, the present experiment was conducted in dryland areas of central Gansu Province and different portions of inorganic N fertilizers (200 kg ha(-1)); i.e., 0, 50, 37.5, 25, and 12.5% were replaced with commercial organic fertilizers to test their effects on soil physicochemical properties, the grain yield of maize, N2O emissions, and the diversity of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacterial (AOB) communities. Results showed that the maximum N2O emission was obtained by 100% inorganic fertilizers and the lowest was obtained at the control (no fertilizer). Substituting inorganic fertilizers with organic manure not only reduced N2O emissions but also improved soil organic carbon content and soil moisture and typically improves grain yield and biomass. The highest reduction in N2O emissions was recorded by 50% substitution. Furthermore, 37.5% and 12.5% substitutions did not reduce the grain yield and biomass compared to 100% inorganic fertilizer, and a 37.5% substitution performed better in improving soil fertility. Organic fertilizer increased the amoA copy number of AOA but decreased that of AOB. Nitrososphaera (AOA) and Nitrosospira (AOB) were the most dominant ammonia-oxidizing communities. Structural equation modeling indicated that AOB contributes more N2O emissions than AOA and is more sensitive to changes in pH, moisture, and NO3--N, and the input of organic fertilizers may affect AOB by influencing soil physicochemical traits. In summary, replacing a reasonable proportion (37.5%) of inorganic fertilizers with organic manure improves soil fertility, reduces N2O emissions, and stabilizes production.

J	Kadkol, G; Sissons, M; Lambert, N; Lisle, C				Kadkol, Gururaj; Sissons, Mike; Lambert, Nicholas; Lisle, Chris			Genetic improvement in grain yield and quality of Australian durum wheat over six decades of breeding	CEREAL CHEMISTRY												Background and Objectives Durum wheat breeding commenced in Australia in the 1930s by the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries (NSW DPI), Australia. Dural was developed in 1956 from a cross between North African landraces. Since then, another 20 varieties have been released in the following six decades by NSW DPI and the University of Adelaide. These were evaluated for agronomic and detailed quality traits including pasta-making quality over three seasons. This study aimed to quantify progress achieved in Australian durum breeding for yield, quality, and some agronomic traits since the release of Dural. Findings A demonstrated grain yield improvement at the rate of 27.8 kg ha(-1) year(-1) up to 2017 has been achieved when generally maintaining low screenings and high thousand grain weight. The recent varieties are medium early in their maturity relative to Dural and possess improved lodging tolerance which has resulted in better adaptation to seasonal conditions under dryland cultivation, and also, adaptation to high input irrigated cropping. Breeding has also resulted in higher technological quality, specifically, improved semolina yellow color, higher dough strength, improved pasta brightness and yellowness but with slightly declining grain protein content. Strong genetic gain was observed in semolina color traits, namely, reduction in a* and increase in b*. Conclusion The progress in Australian durum breeding over the last six decades compares well to the progress achieved in other countries for yield, agronomic, and quality traits. The improvements in yield and quality are expected to continue with future developments focussing on adaptation to meet the changing climate and improving tolerance to a major disease, crown rot, while maintaining high technological quality. Significance and Novelty This is the first study quantifying the progress made in Australian durum breeding efforts and the first study that includes pasta-making quality traits from an historical breeding perspective.					sissons, mike/AFP-1659-2022	sissons, mike/0000-0003-3396-2911; Lambert, Nicholas/0000-0001-8445-4728; Kadkol, Gururaj Pralhad/0000-0002-7042-498X; Lisle, Chris/0000-0002-7291-6187													0009-0352	1943-3638				JAN	2023	100	1					109	130		10.1002/cche.10562	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cche.10562		MAY 2022											WOS:000802906100001
J	Hewett, Z; de Gruchy, M; Hill, D; Lawrence, D				Hewett, Zarina; de Gruchy, Michelle; Hill, Daniel; Lawrence, Dan			Raincheck: A new diachronic series of rainfall maps for Southwest Asia over the Holocene	LEVANT												Fluctuations in climate have been associated with significant societal changes, both in the modern day and in the past. In dryland environments such as much of Southwest Asia, rainfall is often used as a proxy for soil moisture available for crop production, and in pre-industrial societies this is assumed to directly relate to food production capacity and security. However, rainfall values are commonly quoted in archaeological literature without further context. Variability between values arising from different methods and timescales are rarely considered. This is important as small changes in rainfall can have profound effects on the interpretation of sites and landscapes. Here, we present a novel set of snapshot precipitation maps for Southwest Asia between the years 10,240 BP and 300 BP, based on previously published natural archive data by Bar-Matthews and Ayalon (2004) from Soreq Cave, and a newly derived modern rainfall map. The modern map was created using station data from the years 1960-1990 and a geostatistical interpolation technique applied across 14 separate zones. We outline the steps involved in the creation of the maps and provide access to, and clear explanations of, the data and methods used. Using the hindcasted maps, two case studies to highlight why a nuanced approach to rainfall is required in the study of ancient societies are examined. Changes to the spatial extent of the so-called 'Zone of Uncertainty' through time, as well as land suitable for rainfed agriculture throughout time using a simple model are calculated. It is demonstrated that relatively small fluctuations in rainfall can have a significant impact on the distribution of moisture availability for the region. It is argued that archaeologists need to be aware of the sources and limitations of the rainfall data used in their interpretations, and our map series is offered as a baseline dataset.

This study selected different land use patterns developed in purple paddy soil on a decadal time scale, examined the changing rate of soil carbon and nitrogen of the purple paddy soil after abandonment, dry-farming, and fish-farming, and revealed the impact of land use changes on the balance of soil carbon and nitrogen. Results showed that the loss rates of soil organic carbon, readily oxidizable organic carbon and total nitrogen at the initial stage of dry-farming were most considerable, followed by abandonment and fish farming. An average of 11.95-13.94 g kg(-1) soil organic carbon loss and 0.90-1.03 g kg(-1) total nitrogen loss of the cultivation horizon were observed when purple paddy soil was abandoned and dry farmed. In comparison, the net release of soil organic carbon and total nitrogen after fish-farming were 6.64 and-0.23 g kg( 1). The changes of land use of rural area driven by rising labor cost and market demand have been inducing a continuous decline in soil C:N and significantly reducing the purple paddy soil's carbon sequestration ability. The promotion of no-tillage management, increase of organic manure application, and avoidance of over-use of nitrogen fertilizer in dryland farming need to be further considered to meet the dual pressures of China's resource constraints and carbon neutrality goals. A regression model may predict the changes in soil carbon after the change of paddy soil utilization, which provides a pathway for predicting changes in farmland carbon sequestration potential and carbon storage caused by changes in paddy soil utilization in the future.					王, 娅冰/JGE-0541-2023; 郭, 青霞/GZH-2618-2022; li, xiu/GXV-1745-2022	Han, Bangshuai/0000-0003-4510-9993													0301-4797	1095-8630				JUL 15	2022	314								115122	10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115122	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115122		APR 2022						35472841					WOS:000797966500003

In this paper, we present a framework consisting of nine steps to analyze, quantify and, where possible, monetize and capture the effects of changes in land use and man-agement on the true costs and benefits. To illustrate this framework we applied it to large scale landscape restoration in a dryland region in SE Spain that is facing serious land degradation. Based on fieldwork involving several farms and expert interviews between 2017 and 2019, and additional literature review, we compared the costs and benefits, using the so-called Social-or Integrated Cost-Benefit Analyses (i-CBA) approach, of three land use systems: a multi-functional sustainable land use system (MFU) with those of almond monoculture under conventional management (CM) and under sustainable land management (SLM). Our study demonstrates that conventional financial CBA favors short-term, usually non-sustainable, land use. Using i-CBA gives a more realistic insight in the true welfare effects of landscape restoration. Our analysis also shows that a transition from conventional monoculture to multi-functional sustainable land use at the farm-level is only financially feasible when all externalities are accounted for and compensated. Our integrated approach enables the identification of opportunities and mechanisms to optimize multifunctional land use and capture the 'full value' of landscape restoration through so-called blended financing mechanisms. Eventually, sustainable land management can then become the norm rather than the exception because it is both financially more profitable for the private land owner and economically, environmentally and socially more beneficial to the community and society as a whole.

Production Potential of Pigeon Pea Based Intercropping Systems under Various Land Configurations in Marathwada Region of Maharashtra	LEGUME RESEARCH												Backround: Pigeon pea is suitable for intercropping with different crops like soybean, green gram, black gram and cowpea for increasing production, proper land utilization and maintaining soil fertility. The initial slow growth rate and deep root system of pigeon pea offers a good scope for intercropping with fast growing early maturing and shallow rooted crops. Abiotic stresses of dry land farming can be alleviated by effective moisture conservation practices. Considering these points an experiment was conducted to evaluate comparative performance of the pigeon pea based intercropping system with short durational legumes like soybean, green gram, black gram and cowpea under different land configurations. Methods: A field experiment was conducted at experimental farm of AICRP for Dryland Agriculture, V.N.M.KV, Parbhani during kharif season of 2015-16 and 2016-17 to study the production potential of pigeon pea based intercropping systems under various land configurations. The present investigation consisted of 12 treatment combinations comprising of three land configurations in main plot and four intercropping systems in sub plots. Result: Yield attributes and yield of intercrops was influenced significantly by different land configurations. In case of intercrops mean seed yield, mean number of pods plant(-1), weight of pods plant(-1), weight of seed plant(-1), number seeds pod(-1) and number of seeds plant(-1) found to be higher in broad bed furrow than ridges furrow and flatbed method. Similarly, higher seed yield, straw yield, biological yield, harvest index of pigeon pea and pigeon pea equivalent yield was recorded with Broad bed furrows followed ridges and furrow system. Among the intercropping systems, pigeon pea + green gram intercropping systems recorded maximum seed yield, straw yield, biological yield, harvest index of pigeon pea and pigeon pea equivalent yield than other intercropping systems.																			0250-5371					AUG	2021	44	8					947	951		10.18805/LR-4398	http://dx.doi.org/10.18805/LR-4398													WOS:000685660100014

To explore the influences of human activities on the lake's water quality, an improved Water Quality Index (WQI) method and multivariate statistical techniques were adopted to assess the temporal and spatial variations of the lake's water quality and explore the dominant factors of these variations. Datasets for 11 water quality parameters from six monitoring stations were used to evaluate the period spanning from 2006 to 2016. Assessment of the annual WQI showed that the water quality of the lake has generally improved over the past decade. Cluster analysis divided 12 months into the dry and wet periods and the six monitoring stations into those located in the western and eastern parts of the lake. Discriminant analysis demonstrated that with only two parameters (water temperature and fluoride) and six parameters (dissolved oxygen, ammonia nitrogen, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, anionic surfactant, and fecal coliform), 96.0% and 93.8% of the water quality data can be classified into the correct spatial and temporal clusters, respectively. For the principal component analysis and factor analysis, the varifactors detected for the two temporal clusters were similar, and varifactors related to pollution explained more variance in the water quality variation than the ones representing natural factors. For the two spatial clusters, the varifactors were different, indicating they are influenced by different types of anthropogenic activities. Correlation analysis between lake water level and water quality indicated that environmental water allocation to the lake generally improve water quality. These findings provide a more thorough understanding of driving mechanism of water quality and may be helpful for making environmental management decisions in Baiyangdian Lake and other large, shallow lakes in highly populated dryland regions.

J	Baghi, NG; Oldeland, J				Baghi, Naghmeh Gholami; Oldeland, Jens			Do soil-adjusted or standard vegetation indices better predict above ground biomass of semi-arid, saline rangelands in North-East Iran?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Satellite remote sensing has greatly facilitated the assessment of aboveground biomass in rangelands. Soil-adjusted vegetation indices have been developed to provide better predictions of aboveground biomass, especially for dryland regions. Semi-arid rangelands often complicate a remote sensing based assessment of aboveground biomass due to bright reflecting soils combined with sparse vegetation cover. We aim at evaluating whether soil-adjusted vegetation indices perform better than standard, i.e. unadjusted, vegetation indices in predicting dry aboveground biomass of a saline and semi-arid rangeland in NE-Iran. 672 biomass plots of 2 x 2 m were gathered and aggregated into 13 sites. Generalized Linear Regression Models (GLM) were compared for six different vegetation indices, three standard and three soil-adjusted vegetation indices. Vegetation indices were calculated from the MODIS MCD43A4 product. Model comparison was done using Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), Akaike weights and pseudo R-2. Model fits for dry biomass showed that transformed NDVI and NDVI fitted best with R-2 = 0.47 and R-2 = 0.33, respectively. The optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) behaved similar to NDVI but less precise. The soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), the modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI2) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) performed worse than a null model. Hence, soil-adjusted indices based on the soil-line concept performed worse than a simple square root transformation of the NDVI. However, more studies that compare MODIS based vegetation indices for rangeland biomass estimation are required to support our findings. We suggest applying a similar model comparison approach as performed in this study instead of relying on single vegetation indices in order to find optimal relationships with aboveground biomass estimation in rangelands.

However, forest water use for these benefits has become one of the critical concerns in dryland regions where water is limited. Negative forest water use impacts could be reduced by selecting tree species with low rates of transpiration. However, the possible changes of urban tree transpiration and its biophysical controls are still unclear. This study monitored the sap flow of a 58-year-old Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) plantation in a semiarid urban environment of northern China. Soil moisture played an important role in stand transpiration (E-c). E-c had a strong positive relationship with vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and solar radiation (R-s) when soil water was sufficient. In addition, the sensitivity of leaf stomata to VPD was not related to leaf and branch water potential. Under soil water stress, E-c was significantly reduced by 63.1% (p < 0.001) and was weakly related to VPD and R-s. Canopy conductance (g(c)) was reduced (p < 0.001) by 74.3% due to leaf stomatal closure, and the sensitivity of leaf stomata to VPD was significantly increased (p < 0.05) with increasing leaf and branch water potential. Wind speed had no significant effects on E-c. P. tabulaeformis tended to be isohydric with a relatively constant midday leaf water potential (i.e. -2.46 to -2.92 MPa) and strong stomatal regulation as a function of soil water stress. However, slopes (0.53-0.56) of the linear relationship between m (dg(c)/dlnVPD) and reference canopy conductance were significantly lower than the widely recognized 0.6 (p < 0.001). Therefore, urban tree transpiration drivers and forest impacts need to be clarified to better understand the proper tradeoff between water consumption and ecological services for urban areas.

Plant aggregation enhances microclimatic conditions and triggers abiotic and biotic processes, such as nutrient cycling and accumulation, and species interactions. However, vegetation patches may be modified by disturbances in unpredictable ways. We tested whether livestock grazing affects vegetation structure and plant spatial associations in a desert community, by considering the role of plant species in ecological succession. Location Patagonian Monte Desert, Argentina. Methods We used high-quality standardized photographs along transects to characterize plant community structure (i.e., cover, abundance, richness), spatial patterns (i.e. plant-plant associations), and classified species based on their successional role (i.e. early, intermediate and late species). We used regression models and network analysis to evaluate the effect of grazing on vegetation. Results In general, grazing modified community structure, reducing total cover, abundance and richness. Grazing modulated community spatial patterns, simplifying and removing vegetation patches. The impact of grazing depended on the species successional role. The abundance and cover of early species were less affected by grazing than intermediate and late species, the latter being the most affected. However, species richness significantly decreased with increasing stocking rates, regardless of their successional role. Late species were present in most plant spatial associations, indicating a major contribution to multi-specific vegetation patches formation. Conclusions The reduction in species richness and low abundance of late species highlights the need to prevent irreversible degradation caused by overgrazing. Late species emerge as key structures of vegetation in desert rangelands facilitating the establishment and protecting other plant species. Due to the critical role of vegetation patches in maintaining desert ecosystem functioning, conservation and management practices should focus on late species, while early species, responsible for vegetation patch formation in overgrazed situations, should be preferred for restoration practices.

To better understand the coexistence mechanisms of saltcedar (Tamarix mascatensis) and eshnan (Seidlitzia rosmarinus) in central deserts of Iran, we analysed the spatial distributions and soil chemical properties of their mixed stands. Methods We applied uni- and bivariate point process statistics together with mark correlation functions and soil information under the species canopy and in the interspaces to evaluate plant-to-plant interactions. Results Tamarix and Seidlitzia were both highly aggregated in conspecific clusters, and the species were significantly segregated at small spatial scales. Interestingly, we found that the density of conspecific neighbours in Tamarix clusters was higher than Seidlitzia (approximately 9 times more), although the mean density of Tamarix (29.4 shrubs ha(-1)) was lower than Seidlitzia (357.3 shrubs ha(-1)). For both species, intraspecific interactions had negative effects on their size, which was more evident in Tamarix. Our results showed that the size of Seidlitzia was strongly and negatively depended on the proximity of nearby Tamarix. Additionally, the two species improved soil chemical properties and moisture under their canopy compared to bare soil; however, soil salinity under Tamarix (24.29 dS m(-1)) was higher than Seidlitzia (1.68 dS m(-1)). Conclusions According to the segregated spatial pattern of the species and negative effects of Tamarix neighbourhood on Seidlitzia growth, we suggest that high soil salinity beneath Tamarix canopy likely reduces interspecific interactions between the two species and affects Seidlitzia growth. Furthermore, our results indicate no spatial mixture of Tamarix and Seidlitzia, contrary to our expectations, although we still encourage further research on the co-occurrence of the species in the region.

Here, we present results regarding soil C, N and related soil properties at 0-500 cm depth as affected by afforestation at two sites (Fufeng and Yongshou) with contrasting soil inorganic C (SIC) levels in China's Loess Plateau. The concentrations of SIC ranged from 12.94 to 20.17 g kg(-1) in Fufeng and from 0.18 to 0.36 g kg(-1) in Yongshou. The objectives of this study were to examine how soil C and N in deep soils are altered following afforestation and how these effects vary with soil depth and site. We found that the establishment of woodland on cropland increased soil porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity but decreased the bulk density in the topsoils (0-20 cm). The conversion of cropland to woodland resulted in an increase of soil electric conductivity in the topsoils and a decrease in the deep soils in Fufeng but had an opposite influence with soil depth in Yongshou. This land-use change increased organic C and total N concentrations along the 0-500 cm soils at both sites but had divergent effects on the concentrations of SIC and soil total C (STC) between the two sites. Overall, the concentrations of SIC and STC increased in Yongshou but decreased in Fufeng after woodland establishment. The results from this study indicated the determination of the initial SIC concentration on the response of C to afforestation in semiarid soils, and such determination should be considered in biogeochemical models.																			0016-7061	1872-6259				JAN 1	2020	357								113940	10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.113940	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.113940													WOS:000496837300005

Chinaos Loess Plateau (CLP), which has the worldos deepest loess deposit and has experienced long-term, intensive agricultural and revegetation activities, could contain large stores of OC. In this study, the distribution of OC concentration and stock across the entire loess profile from the ground surface down to the bedrock (56-205 m) was assessed at five sites (Yangling, YL; Changwu, CW; Fuxian, FX; Anosai, AS; and Shenmu, SM) under three land use types (farmland, grassland and shrubland). There was pronounced decrease in mean OC concentration with increasing depth along loess profiles at all the investigated sites. OC concentration in the topmost 20 m of the loess was much higher and fluctuated more significantly than that in the deeper layers at YL, CW, FX and AS, where mean annual precipitation was > 550 mm. In contrast, OC concentration was low and stable at SM with mean annual precipitation < 450 mm. The restoration of vegetation with deep roots following the abandonment of farmlands resulted in deep OC accumulation at YL and AS, whereas natural grassland recovery did not result in the accumulation of OC at SM. Our results suggested that land use change could alter OC distribution in deep soils, of which degree depended on climatic condition and vegetation type. The estimated OC storage varied significantly across the sites (859-5044 Mg ha(-1)), which mainly depended on the thickness of loess deposit. OC store on the CLP and other areas around the world with deep soils or sediments could be underestimated and need re-consideration in future C budget studies. This is the first estimate of regional OC stock across loess profile, spanning from the land surface down to the bedrock. The findings could have significant implications for biogeochemical cycling of C in surface and deep soil layers down to the bedrock.

Identification of genes controlling compatible and incompatible reactions of pearl millet (<i>Pennisetum glaucum</i>) against blast (<i>Magnaporthe grisea</i>) pathogen through RNA-Seq	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Blast [Magnaporthe grisea (Herbert) Barr] is an economically important disease in Asian pearl millet production ecologies. The recurrent occurrence of blast in the past one decade has caused enormous strain on grain and forage production. Identification of resistance genes is an important step to develop durable varieties. The present study is the first attempt to use RNA-Seq to investigate the transcript dynamics in a pearl millet inbred ICMB 93333, which had a unique differential reaction to two isolates-Pg 45 (avirulent) and Pg 174 (virulent) of M. grisea. The inbred was inoculated by both isolates and samples taken at six different time intervals for genome-wide RNA-Seq experiment. The transcriptome results revealed the differential expression of more than 2,300 genes. The time-specific comparison showed activation or repression of specific genes in various pathways. Genes and transcriptions factors related to pathogenesis-related proteins, reactive oxygen species generating and its scavenging genes, cell wall defense, primary and secondary metabolic pathways, and signaling pathways were identified by comparing the host-plant compatible and incompatible interactions. The genes identified from this experiment could be useful to understand the host-plant resistance and design novel strategies to manage blast disease in pearl millet.

It consumes soil water after wheat harvest, compromising the yield of the following crop. The objectives of this work were to determine the impact of post-wheat harvest herbicide application timing on Russian thistle control and of stubble height on Russian thistle postharvest control and plant dispersal. For the first objective, experiments were conducted at the Columbia Basin Agricultural Research Center, Adams, OR (CBARC), and the Lind Dryland Research Station, Lind, WA (LDRS), in 2020 and 2021. Herbicides evaluated included paraquat, glyphosate, and either bromoxynil + pyrasulfotole (CBARC) or bromoxynil + metribuzin (LDRS). The different post-wheat harvest application timings were 24 h and 1, 2, and 3 wk after harvest. For the second objective, two stubble heights (short and tall) were compared for their impact on control at CBARC and in a production field near Ione, OR. Paraquat provided the greatest control in all scenarios, with no differences in application timings or stubble height. Impacts of application timings were not clear for glyphosate or bromoxynil mixtures. For glyphosate treatments, control in short stubble was 11% greater than in tall stubble in both years. Control was also greater in short stubble for the bromoxynil + pyrasulfotole application in 2020. However, Russian thistle plant dispersal was greater in short stubble at both locations. At CBARC, plant dispersal in short stubble was 58%, compared to 18% in tall stubble. Near Ione, plant dispersal in flattened stubble was 88%, compared to 43% in nonflattened short stubble. Leaving tall stubble at harvest should be considered to reduce Russian thistle plant dispersal if the infestation is going to be left untreated after harvest; otherwise, short stubble might result in better Russian thistle control when using systemic herbicides, such as glyphosate.					; , Judit/C-4507-2015	Oreja, Fernando/0000-0002-2553-3802; , Judit/0000-0002-4453-275X													0890-037X	1550-2740				2023 SEP 4	2023										10.1017/wet.2023.58	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/wet.2023.58		SEP 2023											WOS:001084064600001

Soil-atmosphere fluxes of CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O across an experimentally-grown, successional gradient of biocrust community types	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are critical components of dryland and other ecosystems worldwide, and are increasingly recognized as novel model ecosystems from which more general principles of ecology can be elucidated. Biocrusts are often diverse communities, comprised of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms with a range of metabolic lifestyles that enable the fixation of atmospheric carbon and nitrogen. However, how the function of these biocrust communities varies with succession is incompletely characterized, especially in comparison to more familiar terrestrial ecosystem types such as forests. We conducted a greenhouse experiment to investigate how community composition and soil-atmosphere trace gas fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O varied from early-successional light cyanobacterial biocrusts to mid-successional dark cyanobacteria biocrusts and late-successional moss-lichen biocrusts and as biocrusts of each successional stage matured. Cover type richness increased as biocrusts developed, and richness was generally highest in the late-successional moss-lichen biocrusts. Microbial community composition varied in relation to successional stage, but microbial diversity did not differ significantly among stages. Net photosynthetic uptake of CO2 by each biocrust type also increased as biocrusts developed but tended to be moderately greater (by up to approximate to 25%) for the mid-successional dark cyanobacteria biocrusts than the light cyanobacterial biocrusts or the moss-lichen biocrusts. Rates of soil C accumulation were highest for the dark cyanobacteria biocrusts and light cyanobacteria biocrusts, and lowest for the moss-lichen biocrusts and bare soil controls. Biocrust CH4 and N2O fluxes were not consistently distinguishable from the same fluxes measured from bare soil controls; the measured rates were also substantially lower than have been reported in previous biocrust studies. Our experiment, which uniquely used greenhouse-grown biocrusts to manipulate community composition and accelerate biocrust development, shows how biocrust function varies along a dynamic gradient of biocrust successional stages.

Studies investigating the impacts of climate and human factors on inter-seasonal grassland dynamics have focused mostly on changes to vegetation structure. Yet, quantifying the impact of these on the inter-seasonal dynamics of specific grassland communities is not known. This study uses digital repeat photography to examine how intra-seasonal grassland dynamics of different grassland communities are affected by precipitation, temperature, and grazing in a heterogeneous semi-arid savannah in Kenya. A low-cost digital repeat camera network allowed for fine-scale temporal and spatial variability analysis of grassland dynamics and grazing intensity. Over all grass communities, our results show precipitation driving mainly early-season and in some cases mid-season flushing, temperature driving end-of-season senescence, and grazing influencing mid-season declines. Yet, our study quantifies how these three drivers do not uniformly impact grassland species communities. Specifically, Cynodon and Cynodon/Bothriochloa communities are rapidly and positively associated with precipitation, where mid-season declines in Cynodon communities are associated with grazing and late-season declines in Cynodon/Bothriochloa communities are associated with temperature increases. Setaria communities, on the other hand, have weaker associations with the drivers, with limited positive associations with precipitation and grazing. Kunthii/Digitaria diverse communities had no association with the three drivers. Highly diverse mixed communities were associated with increased precipitation and temperature, as well as lower intensity grazing. Our research sheds light on the complex interactions between plants, animals, and weather. Furthermore, this study also demonstrates the potential of digital repeated photography to inform about fine-scale spatial and temporal patterns of semi-arid grassland vegetation and grazing, with the goal of assisting in the formulations of management practises that better capture the intra-annual variability of highly heterogeneous dryland systems.

The growth of these forests under climate warming is strongly affected by local environmental factors. However, how environmental factors impact intra-annual stem growth dynamics across environmental gradients in these regions remains unclear. This work focused on assessing seasonal patterns of stem growth across different elevations and how environmental factors impact stem growth in the Qilian Mountains, northwestern China. The stem growth of 50 Qinghai spruce trees was monitored for two years across an elevation gradient from 2500 m to 3300 m above sea level (a.s.l.). We found that growth initiation occurred later as the elevation increased, and growth commenced when elevation-specific temperature thresholds were reached. However, growth cessation presented large elevational differences: cessation occurred much earlier at low elevations (2500 m and 2700 m a.s.l.). Exceptionally early growth cessation occurred predominantly at 2700 m a.s.l., which was correlated with seasonal drought/insufficient rainfall and low soil moisture occurring since mid-July 2015. Temperature and soil moisture were the key factors governing the daily rate of stem growth in the beginning, rapid growth, and end stages. Overall, due to effects of seasonal drought and low temperature on growth cessation and growth rate, the annual growth of Qinghai spruce was rather low at both low (2500-2700 m a.s.l.) and high (3100-3300 m a.s.l.) elevations; middle elevations (approximately 2900 m a.s.l.) might be the most favorable Qinghai spruce growth. Our results implied that tree growth will likely decline at low elevations and that the optimal elevation for Qinghai spruce growth in northwestern China is expected to shift upward under future climate warming.					wang, yanhui/HPG-3348-2023; wu, meng/JPK-1930-2023	Zhang, Lei/0000-0003-0235-4884														1999-4907				MAR	2022	13	3							388	10.3390/f13030388	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f13030388													WOS:000775737200001

Seeing the locust in the swarm: accounting for spatiotemporal hierarchy improves ecological models of insect populations	ECOGRAPHY												Ecological phenomena operate at different spatial scales and are not uniform across landscapes or through time. One ecological theory that attempts to account for scaling and spatiotemporal variances is hierarchical patch dynamics. It introduces a hierarchical patch network with smaller spatiotemporal scales being nested within larger scales. However, few studies have modeled its presence within animal population dynamics. Locusts are an excellent model for investigating the spatiotemporal hierarchy of animal population dynamics, due to their high migratory capacity, large geographic ranges that extend across widely differing environments, and available long-term data on distributions. Here, we investigated the influence of preceding vegetation growth on desert locust Schistocerca gregaria and Australian plague locust Chortoicetes terminifera outbreaks on three spatial levels (species range > geographic region > land unit) and between seasons. Both species are dryland herbivores with population dynamics linked to habitat productivity pulses after rain. We used NDVI data (MODIS imagery) as a measure of vegetation growth in hierarchical generalized additive models at different scales. Locust outbreaks were either preceded by vegetation growth between 78 and 32 days (Australian plague locusts) or 32 and 20 days before (desert locust) the observation. Although prior vegetation growth characterized outbreaks of both species, the temporal pattern of NDVI differed between spatiotemporal levels. All model selection criteria selected for a similar spatial hierarchy for both species: geographic region > land unit which supports the hierarchical patch dynamics paradigm. Further, it illuminates important timing differences between geographic regions and land units for preceding vegetation growth and locust outbreaks which can help locust managers identify when and where outbreaks occur. By acknowledging the spatiotemporal patterning of locust abundance, we account for heterogeneity of population dynamics throughout species ranges. Our findings demonstrate the importance of incorporating spatiotemporal variation in population models of insects and other animals.

Interpreting the sensitivity of ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE) to aridity could provide important environmental implications to water conservation and carbon budgets of drylands. The effects of temporal aridity changes on WUE in semi-arid ecosystems, particularly in meadow steppes, have been poorly investigated. In this study, we used eddy-covariance data from two representative temperate meadows on Mongolian Plateau, Changling (2007-2015, China) and Bayan (2014-2018, Mongolia), to understand the interand intra-annual changes of WUE by evaporative fraction (EF), as well as the climatic and biotic controls on gross ecosystem production (GEP), evapotranspiration (ET) and partitioned evaporation (T) and transpiration (E). Results showed that the response of annual WUE to EF was positive in Changling meadow with dry atmosphere but insignificant in Bayan with cold climate; the contrasting WUEs were driven by divergent GEP and ET responses to EF in two meadows. Monthly T/ET increased linearly with EF in both meadows, but logarithmically with leaf area index (LAI). Bayan and Changling meadows had a similar instantaneous WUE (WUEp, GEP/T) that were insensitive to EF change. We also found that the frequency of growing season precipitation affected WUE at both sites. We conclude that contrasting GEP responses to EF determined the meadow WUE variations. The magnitude and changes in transpiration and evaporation provide further insights on the biophysical regulations (i.e., LAI) of ecosystem water use and WUEp. This study indicated that differences in ecosystem water yield, soil water status and sensitivities of GEP and ET partitioning jointly contributed to the divergent WUE at the two meadow steppes in this semi-arid region.

However, the impact of the El Nino South Oscillation on these forests provides a unique set of conditions with high water availability that increase water consumption and plant growth. We studied the performance of seedlings of Prosopis pallida from different populations along an environmental gradient in North Peru. We wanted to know if the responses of growth and biomass allocation to water availability differ among the populations. For this, we grew seedlings from seven P. pallida populations, in a greenhouse experiment, with low or high water availability for 2 months. Our results show that P. pallida responds differently to water availability. Under high water availability, plant biomass was correlated positively to evapotranspiration and root mass allocation, and negatively to leaf mass per area and leaf gas exchange. However, at low water availability, plant biomass was also correlated positively to wood density and negatively to leaf water potential. The relative distance plasticity index showed that the populations responded differently to water availability, but it was not related to climatic factors. Only for a few traits (plant height, instantaneous water use efficiency, and water use efficiency), the phenotypic plasticity was negatively correlated with the mean annual temperature and rainfall at the site of the population ' s origin, showing that it was reduced under harsh climatic conditions. In summary, root mass allocation, water transport, and leaf structure play an important role in the growth response of plants of this species to extreme rainfall events.

THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS												Key messageThe identified 30 functional nucleotide polymorphisms or genic SNP markers would offer essential information for marker-assisted breeding in groundnut.A genome-wide association study (GWAS) on component traits of LLS resistance in an eight-way multiparent advance generation intercross (MAGIC) population of groundnut in the field and in a light chamber (controlled conditions) was performed via an Affymetrix 48 K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 'Axiom Arachis' array. Multiparental populations with high-density genotyping enable the detection of novel alleles. In total, five quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with marker - log10(p value) scores ranging from 4.25 to 13.77 for the incubation period (IP) and six QTLs with marker - log10(p value) scores ranging from 4.33 to 10.79 for the latent period (LP) were identified across the A- and B-subgenomes. A total of 62 markers-trait associations (MTAs) were identified across the A- and B-subgenomes. Markers for LLS scores and the area under the disease progression curve (AUDPC) recorded for plants in the light chamber and under field conditions presented - log10 (p value) scores ranging from 4.22 to 27.30. The highest number of MTAs (six) was identified on chromosomes A05, B07 and B09. Out of a total of 73 MTAs, 37 and 36 MTAs were detected in subgenomes A and B, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that both subgenomes have equal potential genomic regions contributing to LLS resistance. A total of 30 functional nucleotide polymorphisms or genic SNP markers were detected, among which eight genes were found to encode leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor-like protein kinases and putative disease resistance proteins. These important SNPs can be used in breeding programmes for the development of cultivars with improved disease resistance.																			0040-5752	1432-2242				MAR	2023	136	3							43	10.1007/s00122-023-04256-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-023-04256-7								36897383					WOS:000948578300001
J	Glover, D; Mausch, K; Conti, C; Hall, A				Glover, Dominic; Mausch, Kai; Conti, Costanza; Hall, Andy			Unplanned but well prepared: A reinterpreted success story of international agricultural research, and its implications	OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE												A recent study found that adoption rates of improved chickpea varieties were above 90 per cent in Andhra Pradesh, India. In this paper, we use a novel perspective to reconstruct and attribute how this outcome came about. The accepted success narrative is that the public international agricultural research system developed some excellent new chickpea varieties, which were well suited to local agro-ecologies, farming systems and cropping patterns, and highly appreciated by farmers. We argue that this narrative is incomplete, because it constitutes only a partial explanation of the confluence of factors that led to the outcome. We reconstruct the success story using a recent conceptual framework that decomposes the technological change process into four aspects: propositions, encounters, dispositions and responses (PEDR). We show that many of the factors which contributed to the spread of modern chickpea varieties in Andhra Pradesh lay beyond the control of the international agricultural research system, and operated across large spatial and temporal scales. In conclusion, we argue that the success of improved chickpeas in Andhra Pradesh underscores the value of basic plant breeding and research, which aim to produce public goods. We relate our analysis to current discussions about the future strategic direction of international agricultural research organisations and the CGIAR. Our argument implies a criticism of the drive to develop new varieties which conform to product profiles that are based on predictions of current and near-term demand. While that approach makes sense for product developers seeking to serve commercial markets, basic research is needed to create and diversify technical options, which anticipate a range of future needs that are hard to predict in the present.

Here, we estimate Indonesia's NCS mitigation opportunity for the first time using national datasets. We calculated the maximum NCS mitigation potential extent using datasets of annual national land cover, peat soil, and critical lands. We collated a national emissions factor database for each pathway, calculated from a meta-analysis, recent publications from our team, and available literature. The maximum NCS mitigation potential in 2030 is 1.3 +/- 0.04 GtCO(2)e yr(-1), based on the historical baseline period from 2009-2019. This maximum NCS potential is double Indonesia's nationally determined contribution (NDC) target from the forestry and other land use sector. Of this potential opportunity, 77% comes from wetland ecosystems. Peatlands have the largest NCS mitigation potential (960 +/- 15.4 MtCO(2)e yr(-1) or 71.5 MgCO(2)e ha(-1) yr(-1)) among all other ecosystems. Mangroves provide a smaller total potential (41.1 +/- 1.4 MtCO(2)e yr(-1)) but have a much higher mitigation density (12.2 MgCO(2)e ha(-1) yr(-1)) compared to dryland ecosystems (2.9 MgCO(2)e ha(-1) yr(-1)). Therefore, protecting, managing, and restoring Indonesia's wetlands is key to achieving the country's emissions reduction target by 2030. The results of this study can be used to inform conservation programs and national climate policy to prioritize wetlands and other land sector initiatives to fulfill Indonesia's NDC by 2030, while simultaneously providing additional co-benefits and contributing to COVID-19 recovery and economic sustainability.

The paddy fields have expanded approximately 14 times in the Sanjiang Plain since the 1990s. The main conversion sources for this expansion are dryland, wetland, and woodland. This expansion in paddy area induced by different sources has an integrated effect on regional climate that may produce warming or cooling effect, with different intensities in different zones. In this study, two numerical experiments (case A and case B) were designed to simulate the impacts of paddy expansion on temperature and energy flux by using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Irrigation cannot be ignored that it is considered a unique agricultural management measure for paddy field compared to other land covers. And considered to depict paddy expansion process accurately, multiple remote sensing-based vegetation indexes, such as green vegetation fraction (GVF) and surface albedo (ALB) were incorporated to specify the vegetation properties induced by paddy expansion. Hegang concentrated expansion zones (HGCE), Fuyuan concentrated expansion zones (FYCE), Tongjiang concentrated expansion zones (TICE), and Sanjiang Plain expansion zones (SJPE) were selected for this research. The results revealed that paddy expansion decreased the near-surface temperature. Cumulative temperature declined by 0.80 degrees C (HGCE), 0.61 degrees C (FYCE), 0.69 degrees C (TJCE), and 0.43 degrees C (SJPE) from June to September with more significant near-surface cooling in summer (July and August). In terms of energy balance, an increase in latent heat (LH) and ground heat flux (G) and a decrease in sensible heat (SH) were observed, but the impact of paddy expansion was more significant on LH, followed by SH and G, respectively. This study provides valuable information for future agricultural activities adjustment and mitigating climate change at the regional scale.																			0177-798X	1434-4483				OCT	2022	150	1-2					405	423		10.1007/s00704-022-04145-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-022-04145-x		AUG 2022											WOS:000839545700001
J	Nelson, C; Garcia-Pichel, F				Nelson, Corey; Garcia-Pichel, Ferran			Beneficial Cyanosphere Heterotrophs Accelerate Establishment of Cyanobacterial Biocrust	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are communities of microbes that inhabit the surface of and soils and provide essential services to dryland ecosystems. While resistant to extreme environmental conditions, biocrusts are susceptible to anthropogenic disturbances that can deprive ecosystems of these valuable services for decades. Until recently, culture-based efforts to produce inoculum for cyanobacterial biocrust restoration in the southwestern United States focused on producing and inoculating the most abundant primary producers and biocrust pioneers, Microcoleus vaginatus and members of the family Coleofasciculaceae (also called Microcoleus steenstrupii complex). The discovery that a unique microbial community characterized by diazotrophs, known as the cyanosphere, is intimately associated with M. vaginatus suggests a symbiotic division of labor in which nutrients are traded between phototrophs and heterotrophs. To probe the potential use of such cyanosphere members in the restoration of biocrusts, we performed coinoculations of soil substrates with cyanosphere constituents. This resulted in cyanobacterial growth that was more rapid than that seen for inoculations with the cyanobacterium alone. Additionally, we found that the mere addition of beneficial heterotrophs enhanced the formation of a cohesive biocrust without the need for additional phototrophic biomass within native soils that contain trace amounts of biocrust cyanobacteria. Our findings support the hitherto-unknown role of beneficial heterotrophic bacteria in the establishment and growth of biocrusts and allow us to make recommendations concerning biocrust restoration efforts based on the presence of remnant biocrust communities in disturbed areas. Future biocrust restoration efforts should consider cyanobacteria and their beneficial heterotrophic community as inoculants. IMPORTANCE The advancement of biocrust restoration methods for cyanobacterial biocrusts has been largely achieved through trial and error. Successes and failures could not always be traced back to particular factors. The investigation and application of foundational microbial interactions existing within biocrust communities constitute a crucial step toward informed and repeatable biocrust restoration methods.

Glenn (1947-2017): A legacy of scientific environmental assessment and applications in hydrological processes'	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												This special issue (SI) 'A Tribute to Edward P. Glenn (1947-2017): A legacy of Scientific Environmental Assessment and Applications in Hydrological Processes' is a celebration of the extensive work of Dr. Ed Glenn that was instrumental across multiple sub-disciplines of hydrology. The SI highlights four primary areas of hydrological processes that are cornerstones of Ed Glenn's over four decades of research. These contributions cover the following specialties: (i) Hydrology in the Colorado River Delta; (ii) Riparian ecosystem water use; (iii) Riparian Plant ecophysiology and ecohydrology; and (iv) Methods and models to characterize evapotranspiration. Since Ed was passionate about the dryland delta at the end of the Colorado River, we begin with four research studies that focus on this special region on the U.S.-Mexico border which encompasses four states (Baja and Sonora in Mexico and California and Arizona in United States) as well as tribal communities in the transboundary area. The Colorado River delta reaches the Northern Gulf of California in the Sea of Cortez which has been designated as a UNESCO international biosphere reserve ('Reserva de la Biosfera El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar'), which includes the Upper Gulf of California and Delta of the Colorado River ('Reserva de la Biosfera Alto Golfo de California y Delta del Rio Colorado'). Ed spent the majority of his last three decades on water balance studies and on ground-based transpiration quantification for validation of satellite and airborne remote sensing methods. We wrap up the special issue with contributions related to improving satellite and airborne remote sensing estimation of actual evapotranspiration. It is our pleasure to summarize the 16 research studies contributed to the special issue to honour Ed Glenn's research interests.

J	Chhogyel, N; Kumar, L; Bajgai, Y				Chhogyel, Ngawang; Kumar, Lalit; Bajgai, Yadunath			Invasion status and impacts of parthenium weed (<i>Parthenium hysterophorus</i>) in West-Central region of Bhutan	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Parthenium weed (Parthenium hysterophorus L.) is an invasive alien plant species that is spreading rapidly all over the world. With globalization and climate change, it will continue to spread, posing threats to agriculture, biodiversity and the environment. To determine its invasion and impacts in Bhutan, an investigation was undertaken in West-Central Bhutan using a questionnaire survey, complemented by MaxEnt modelling. Most farmers (19-30%) recall having seen parthenium for the last 11-15 years, or more. Infestations of parthenium differed significantly (P < 0.05) across three districts for dryland, orchards, fallow land and pastures, but not in rice fields and on roadsides. The most intensely invaded land types were fallow land, pastures, and roadsides, with farmers perceiving it as 'somewhat common'(score similar to 3) and 'common' (score similar to 4) weed. Farmers' perceptions of the invasiveness of parthenium weed were high at 77% (Wangdue), 80% (Punakha), and 88% (Tsirang), considering it as at least 'somewhat invasive', or higher. Only 13-25% of respondents scored the weed as 'highly invasive'. Parthenium invasion significantly (P < 0.01 to 0.001) escalated the cost of production, reduced fodder quality, supressed native species and caused allergies to the locals in the study districts. Further, MaxEnt modelling of parthenium distribution was undertaken, using the parthenium presence-only data and bioclimatic variables, under 2 CO2 emission scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), i.e. Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6 and 8.5). The projections showed discernible spatial changes in climate suitability over 2070, mostly in the mid- and high-altitude zones, indicating aggressive incursion into Bhutan's important agro-ecological landscapes. The findings, highlight the urgent need to initiate parthenium management strategies for food production and natural resources.

We measured community composition, abundance, richness and foraging attempts of insectivorous bats in the centre of dryland cotton crops using acoustic sampling. We examined how bat activity was related to woody vegetation in the surrounding landscape, prey insect abundance, distance to crop edge, size of field, proximity to water-bodies and moon illumination to better understand insectivorous bat diversity and foraging in crop interiors. We collected a total of 9467 acoustic files including 1198 foraging attempts (feeding buzzes) of at least 21 insectivorous bat species. The bat assemblage in cotton crop interiors (richness and diversity) was positively related to woody vegetation foliage cover within 5-10 km of the crop, as well as Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera abundance, but was negatively related to distance from the field edge into the crop and moon illumination. Increased feeding attempts were linked to increased Lepidoptera and Hemiptera on nights of high moon illumination ( > 75 %). Bat activity and foraging was also higher during nights of increased insect abundance, particularly Lepidoptera, indicating that bats track food resources. Our results highlight the importance of managing bat roosting habitat at different landscape scales to enhance bat diversity and foraging in crop interiors and thus insect consumption. Given the high bat feeding activity on nights of high moon illumination and increased Hemiptera abundance, the timing of insecticide sprays to target pests, such as Hemipteran sucking bugs, could be scheduled on nights of low moon illumination. Such information is useful in identifying conservation priorities for the management of bats in intensively farmed agroecosystems and should facilitate habitat management by growers to maximise crop pest protection services in crop interiors.

Crop type identification and spatial mapping using Sentinel-2 satellite data with focus on field-level information	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												Accurate monitoring of croplands helps in making decisions (for insurance claims, crop management and contingency plans) at the macro-level, especially in drylands where variability in cropping is very high owing to erratic weather conditions. Dryland cereals and grain legumes are key to ensuring the food and nutritional security of a large number of vulnerable populations living in the drylands. Reliable information on area cultivated to such crops forms part of the national accounting of food production and supply in many Asian countries, many of which are employing remote sensing tools to improve the accuracy of assessments of cultivated areas. This paper assesses the capabilities and limitations of mapping cultivated areas in the Rabi (winter) season and corresponding cropping patterns in three districts characterized by small-plot agriculture. The study used Sentinel-2 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 15-day time-series at 10 m resolution by employing a Spectral Matching Technique (SMT) approach. The use of SMT is based on the well-studied relationship between temporal NDVI signatures and crop phenology. The rabi season in India, dominated by non-rainy days, is best suited for the application of this method, as persistent cloud cover will hamper the availability of images necessary to generate clearly differentiating temporal signatures. Our study showed that the temporal signatures of wheat, chickpea and mustard are easily distinguishable, enabling an overall accuracy of 84%, with wheat and mustard achieving 86% and 94% accuracies, respectively. The most significant misclassifications were in irrigated areas for mustard and wheat, in small-plot mustard fields covered by trees and in fragmented chickpea areas. A comparison of district-wise national crop statistics and those obtained from this study revealed a correlation of 96%.

We examined grassland responses to a long-term drought on the Darling Downs, eastern Australia, using the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), a remotely sensed measure of primary productivity. This extreme drought period had rainfall deficits comparable to the hottest and driest projected climate change scenarios for 2030 and was followed by extreme rainfall. This juxtaposition allowed investigation of grassland dynamics (decline and recovery) under extreme climatic variability. Our aim was to determine whether factors associated with grassland decline during extreme drought are the same as those that drive recovery post drought. There is limited knowledge about whether the determinants of grassland decline and recovery are consistent, but this information is important for understanding how best to reduce grassland decline, without inhibiting recovery. We calculated EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) trends at 2549 grassland sites situated in an agricultural landscape and used boosted regression trees to model these against multiple hydro-climatic and land use factors. As anticipated, hydro-climatic variables were key drivers of EVI trends in both the drought and wet phases, with higher soil moisture corresponding to less decline in the drought phase and enhanced recovery in the wet phase; however, land use and plant trait variables were also important predictors of EVI trends. Higher proportions of dryland agriculture in the local landscape, high C3:C4 ratios and lower proportions of woody vegetation in the local landscape were associated with negative EVI trends (i.e. greater decline) during drought, but had inverse or negligible effects during the post drought recovery phase. Our results suggest that mitigating decline and fostering grassland recovery following drought requires considering multiple hydro-climatic, land use and plant trait drivers and how their importance changes under drought and wet phases.

J	Ghosh, A; Bera, B				Ghosh, Arijit; Bera, Biswajit			Hydrogeochemical assessment of groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation applying groundwater quality index (GWQI) and irrigation water quality index (IWQI)	GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												In recent times, the contamination of groundwater in the extended part of Chota Nagpur Plateau becomes a big concern. The demand of high-quality drinking and irrigation water has been significantly augmented. Conse-quently, productivity and fertility of soils are being reduced in the recent years due to use of low quality irri-gation water. Thus, it is crucial to know the groundwater quality for the appropriate planning and management of groundwater resources to determine its use for drinking and irrigation purposes. Therefore, the principal objectives of this study are (i) to evaluate the magnitude and spatial variations of groundwater quality using the Groundwater Quality Index (GWQI) for drinking and (ii) to examine the irrigation suitability of groundwater using irrigation water quality index (IWQI). Sodium absorption ratio (SAR), Soluble sodium percentage (SSP), Magnesium hazard (MH), Kelly's index (KI), Permeability Index (PI) have been applied for suitability of irri-gation water. Result showed that in 2021, GWQI values vary from 51.75 to 171.18 and seven blocks of the Purulia district among twenty blocks have poor drinking water quality while in 2022 it ranges from 70.27 to 178.45 and eight blocks stand poor water quality. In terms of irrigation water quality, Purulia II and Hura blocks come under the 'doubtful' or 'poor 'categories in pre and post-monsoon seasons for both the years. Hydro-chemical facies through Piper, USSL and Durov's diagram showed medium to high salinity and low to me-dium sodium hazards in this region. Feldspar and biotite minerals of granite and gneiss accelerate the bicar-bonate and chloride ions in groundwater. Non point sources are also responsible for water quality deterioration in this agricultural dominated region. These research findings will help to policy makers and administrators for the management of groundwater resources and agricultural sustainability particularly in the dryland region.																			2352-801X					AUG	2023	22								100958	10.1016/j.gsd.2023.100958	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gsd.2023.100958		MAY 2023											WOS:001002498500001

Regional-Scale Wilting Point Estimation Using Satellite SIF, Radiative-Transfer Inversion, and Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer Simulation: A Grassland Study	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Although water availability strongly controls gross primary production (GPP), the impact of soil moisture content (SMC) (wilting point) is poorly quantified on regional and global scales. In this study, we used 10 years of observations of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from the Greenhouse gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) satellite to estimate the wilting point of a semiarid grassland on the Mongolian Plateau. Radiative-transfer model inversion and soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer simulation were sequentially conducted to distinguish the drought impacts on plant physiology from the changes in the leaf-canopy optical properties. We modified an existing inversion algorithm and the widely used Soil-Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes model to adequately evaluate dryland features, for example, sparse canopy and strong convection. The modified model, with retrieved parameters and calibration to GOSAT SIF, predicted realistic GPP values. We found that (a) the SIF yield estimated from GOSAT showed a clear sigmoidal pattern in relation to drought, and the estimated wilting point matched ground-based observations in the literature within similar to 0.01 m(3) m(-3) for the SMC, (b) tuning the maximum carboxylation rate improved the SIF prediction after considering the changes in the leaf-canopy optical properties, implying that GOSAT detected drought stress in leaf-level photosynthesis, and (c) the surface energy balance significantly impacted the grassland's SIF; the modified model reproduced observed SIF well (mean bias = 0.004 mW m(-2) nm(-1) sr(-1) in summer), whereas the original model predicted substantially low values under weak horizontal wind conditions. Some model-observation mismatches in the SIF suggest that more research is needed for fluorescence parametrization (e.g., photoinhibition) and for additional observation constraints.

J	Yang, L; Zhang, FH; Luo, YQ				Yang, Lei; Zhang, Fenghua; Luo, Yanqin			A Soil Nematode Community Response to Reclamation of Salinized Abandoned Farmland	ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES												Development from abandoned land to farmland after vegetation reestablishment for reclamation is an important salinization rehabilitation process in dryland ecosystems. While subsequent soil abiotic changes have been reported, few studies have focused on how reclamation affects the soil biota. Understanding the response of soil biota to reclamation is useful for evaluating the effect of agricultural management. We investigated soil physiochemical properties, the composition and structure of nematode communities, and nematode metabolic footprints in control and reclaimed farmland. The results showed that soil properties were significantly altered by reclamation. In particular, reclamation significantly increased pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, and microbial biomass carbon. Conversely, electrical conductivity was significantly decreased. Shannon and Simpson indices were affected by reclamation. Reclamation significantly increased the Shannon index in the 10-20 cm soil layer. Reclamation significantly increased the Simpson index in the 0-10 cm soil layer, while the opposite was observed in the 10-20 cm soil layer. High basal index and fungal-based channel were found in the control. Total nematode abundance increased due to reclamation, which included fungivores, herbivores, and omnivores-predators. More nematodes could store more biomass carbon in the reclaimed farmland. Reclamation had an effect on the structure and function of soil food web, and increased the metabolic footprints of various trophic groups of nematodes. Nematode faunal analysis revealed that exogenous substances input led to the high level of communities structure, and the soil food web matured in the reclaimed farmland. The nematode communities were affected by reclamation. Furthermore, pH, EC, SOC, TN, and MBC were key driving factors affecting the nematode communities. Therefore, reclamation could effectively enhance the structure and function of soil food web through bottom-up effects in the cotton fields in Xinjiang, China.																			1021-5506	1810-522X				DEC 7	2021	60								72	10.6620/ZS.2021.60-72	http://dx.doi.org/10.6620/ZS.2021.60-72								35665088					WOS:000729614300001

Polyphenols leaching and seed dormancy in carob (<i>Ceratonia siliqua</i> L.) in relation to hot water treatment	ACTA PHYSIOLOGIAE PLANTARUM												Carob (Ceratonia siliqua L.) is a relevant element of the Mediterranean spontaneous vegetation. Moreover, it is useful in reforestation, and it is currently re-valued for sustainable agriculture in dryland areas. However, the difficulties tied to carob propagation (mainly seed dormancy) hamper its large-scale cultivation. In this paper, the effects of four seed treatments (no treatment [control], soaking at 70 degrees C and 90 degrees C in water, or in 96% sulphuric acid) on five carob genotypes germination were studied. As compared to the very low germination of untreated seeds (0-13% germination), sulphuric acid (93-100% germination) and 90 degrees C water soaking (from 72 to > 90% germination in four out the five genotypes) were effective in promoting germination. Soaking at 90 degrees C resulted in the leaching of a higher amount of total polyphenols from the genotypes seed coat as compared to soaking at 70 degrees C. A significant correlation (0.75**) was ascertained between polyphenol leaching of the different genotypes and germination. These results suggest that dormancy in this species is not primarily associated with seed coat hardness, as it is generally thought, but also with the release of polyphenols. Polyphenols determination of the dormant and the few non-dormant seeds of the different genotypes also seem to confirm this hypothesis since these last showed an almost halved total polyphenols content (on average 17.0) as compared to dormant ones (34.8 mg g(-1) of seed FW). Further studies may determine the polyphenols involved, but also assess new, easier to carry out, seed treatments. The important role of the galactomannans on seed germination of carob is also discussed. Finally, similar studies may enhance the knowledge of dormancy processes in other Fabaceae species whose germination is positively affected by hot water treatments.																			0137-5881	1861-1664				NOV	2021	43	11							141	10.1007/s11738-021-03308-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-021-03308-z													WOS:000706130000001

Further examination included the influence of all gathered anaerobic strength indices on the results of 100-m front crawl race. Methods: The study involved 26 male swimmers (age: 19.8 +/- 2.48 years). Fat-free mass, total body water and muscle mass of arms, legs, and trunk were measured. Dry-land average work, maximal power generated in 40-second arm-cranking test, and work generated in 20 countermovement jumps were evaluated. The forces generated separately by arms and legs were assessed during 40-second tethered swimming All indices of body composition were found strongly correlated with indices of average work and maximal power generated by arms and legs in dryland tests. Results: Muscle mass of arms and trunk moderately and strongly (r = 0.44-0.64) influenced the force generated by arms in tethered swimming There was no significance in the relationship of leg muscle mass and force generated by legs in tethered swimming Significant relationships were observed between the results of the 100-m front crawl and the muscle mass of the arms, trunk, legs, as well as the average work and maximal power in the arm-cranking test (r: 0.39-0.54). The average impulse of arm force and maximal leg force in tethered swimming moderately and significantly correlated with 100-m swimming results. Conclusions: The study concludes the relevance of developing muscle mass balanced to the body size, which is involved in propulsion force production in sprint front crawl swimming.

The effect of tillage on nitrogen use efficiency in maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.) in a ridge-furrow plastic film mulch system	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												The widely adopted maize planting pattern of ridge-furrow plastic film mulch (RFPM) in rainfed agricultural areas of the Loess Plateau has resulted in water-saving and increased yields. However, tillage practices used before RFPM may have had varying effects on the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface fertilizers and soil nutrients. To date, no studies have investigated the combined effects of tillage type and RFPM on crop performance. A two-year trial incorporated three treatments-conventional flat planting (CK), rotary tillage before RFPM (MR), and plow tillage before RFPM (MP). Within each treatment plot, a micro-plot was established to trace the fate of urea-N (only 15N labeled in 2017 and 2018). This study aimed to explore the effects of two tillage practices before RFPM on urea-N recovery by crops, crop growth, and water use efficiency. The RFPM significantly improved soil hydrothermal conditions during maize growth-the ridges had lower surface soil moisture contents than the furrows, with more moisture accumulation in the furrows-but water use efficiency did not differ between MR and MP. The spatial distribution of nutrients under RFPM differed between the two tillage practices. The ridges under RFPM had significantly higher soil organic matter (SOM) and total nitrogen (TN) than the furrows, more so in the MP furrows than the MR furrows. Soil NO3--N did not significantly differ between ridges and furrows, but MP improved nitrogen use efficiency and significantly reduced N2O emissions, relative to MR At harvest, MP had significantly higher yields than MR and CK, and the highest net income of the three treatments. In conclusion, plow tillage before RFPM had better economic and ecological benefits than rotary tillage and has the potential to help establish sustainable agricultural systems in dryland China.

J	Zhang, L; Liu, YF; Yin, CJ; Xue, DP; Gui, DW; Qi, ZM				Zhang, Lei; Liu, Yunfei; Yin, Changjun; Xue, Dongping; Gui, Dongwei; Qi, Zhiming			Effects of Farmland Landscape Fragmentation on Agricultural Irrigation in Hotan Oasis	AGRICULTURE-BASEL												Farmland landscape fragmentation is an important problem affecting the agricultural modernization process in China. However, farmland landscape fragmentation leads to land being wasted and increases management costs, particularly in the dryland's oasis regions. Therefore, investigating the impact of farmland landscape fragmentation on agricultural irrigation is of great significance in developing oasis agriculture. This paper used the landscape quantitative index (DIVISION), the moving window method, and gradient analysis methods to study the temporal and spatial pattern changes in farmland fragmentation in the Hotan Oasis. Additionally, the impact of fragmentation on irrigation in the oasis was elaborated upon by exploring the relationship between evapotranspiration and its components in farmland fragmentation. The results showed that the farmland area of the Hotan Oasis increased from 1546.19 km(2) in 2000 to 2068.23 km(2) in 2020, and farmland landscape fragmentation increased with the expansion of the Hotan Oasis. In addition, a significant relationship between farmland fragmentation and evapotranspiration and its components was evident. A lower DIVISION value corresponded to a higher ET value, a lower ETs/ETc ratio, and a higher water use efficiency. When the total farmland area is assumed to remain unchanged, the irrigation water consumption is reduced by 4.82 x 10(8) m(3) according to the size and proportion of arable land with the lowest degree of fragmentation (L1, division value of 0.46). In addition, with the increase in the proportion of farmland, the scale of oasis decreases by 2431.56 km(2) for the reduction in field roads, shelterbelt, and bare land. These findings suggest that solving the problem of farmland fragmentation can effectively reduce irrigation water consumption, realize the internal expansion of the oasis through intensive land use, and relieve the pressure of the external expansion of the oasis.

Ecosystem CO<sub>2</sub> release driven by wind occurs in drylands at global scale	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Subterranean ventilation is a non-diffusive transport process that provokes the abrupt transfer of CO2-rich air (previously stored) through water-free soil pores and cracks from the vadose zone to the atmosphere, under high-turbulence conditions. In dryland ecosystems, whose biological carbon exchanges are poorly characterized, it can strongly determine eddy-covariance CO2 fluxes that are used to validate remote sensing products and constrain models of gross primary productivity. Although subterranean ventilation episodes (VE) may occur in arid and semi-arid regions, which are unsung players in the global carbon cycle, little research has focused on the role of VE CO2 emissions in land-atmosphere CO2 exchange. This study shows clear empirical evidence of globally occurring VE. To identify VE, we used in situ quality-controlled eddy-covariance open data of carbon fluxes and ancillary variables from 145 sites in different open land covers (grassland, cropland, shrubland, savanna, and barren) across the globe. We selected the analyzed database from the FLUXNET2015, AmeriFlux, OzFlux, and AsiaFlux networks. To standardize the analysis, we designed an algorithm to detect CO2 emissions produced by VE at all sites considered in this study. Its main requirement is the presence of considerable and non-spurious correlation between the friction velocity (i.e., turbulence) and CO2 emissions. Of the sites analyzed, 34% exhibited the occurrence of VE. This vented CO2 emerged mainly from arid ecosystems (84%) and sites with hot and dry periods. Despite some limitations in data availability, this research demonstrates that VE-driven CO2 emissions occur globally. Future research should seek a better understanding of its drivers and the improvement of partitioning models, to reduce uncertainties in estimated biological CO2 exchanges and infer their contribution to the global net ecosystem carbon balance.

Post-fledging survival, movements, and habitat associations of Gray Vireos in New Mexico	AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY												Annual population growth in songbirds can be particularly sensitive to post-fledging survival, but research and management are frequently biased toward the nesting stage. Post-fledging information is particularly scarce for species breeding in desert bird communities, many of which have collapsed in recent decades. During 2017-2019 at Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico, USA, we used radio telemetry to monitor survival, movements, and habitat associations of 90 fledgling Gray Vireos (Vireo vicinior), a desert-dwelling species of conservation concern. We used logistic exposure models to investigate the relationship between fledgling survival and habitat features at two spatial scales. Overall, we estimated that 51 +/- 8% of fledglings survived the monitoring period. All mortalities occurred during the first 12 days post-fledging and were attributed to predation and environmental exposure. In daily survival models focused on predation mortalities, age was the strongest predictor of survival. Daily survival rate was not related to any habitat variables we measured. Percent tree cover used by birds during the first 12 days post-fledging was similar to that of nesting sites and greater than that of random locations. Similarly, fledglings occupied individual trees and shrubs with lateral vegetation cover similar to that of nest locations. Minimum daily distance traveled, distance from nests, and variance associated with these measures, all increased with age. Except for the use of a larger area, habitats used by Gray Vireos during the post-fledging period were similar to those used for nesting in our study population, indicating that maintenance of large patches of moderately dense juniper is desirable for this species. More study is needed from populations in less pristine and more heterogeneous landscapes. More broadly, given the importance of first-year survival in demographic models and the declines of dryland birds, information is needed on the postfledging period of many desert songbirds.

J	Mandishona, E; Knight, J				Mandishona, Emmah; Knight, Jasper			Feedbacks and Trade-Offs in the Use of Wetland Ecosystem Services by Local Communities in Rural Zimbabwe	SUSTAINABILITY												Rural wetlands, especially in developing countries, have been exploited for different ecosystem services because they are considered safety nets for food production and are important for livelihood strategies and human wellbeing. However, there are gaps in knowledge of the ecosystem services provided by small, valley bottom wetlands, especially in dryland areas and how these services are used and managed by local communities. This study focuses on the ecosystem services of valley bottom wetlands in Zindi, the Honde Valley, in rural eastern Zimbabwe. Ethnographic observations of wetland users' activities and individual interviews with local residents and village heads were undertaken in this study, focusing on how people make use of the different ecosystem services that are derived from these wetlands. Results show that the wetlands are mainly utilised for provisioning services, but that these are related to the availability and properties of supporting and regulatory services in the wetland environment. All of these services are also strongly mediated by the traditional cultural contexts and values held by local communities. The results show that the exploitation of some ecosystem services leads to negative impacts on the availability or properties of others, and this means that there are trade-offs in the uses and management by individuals and communities as a whole. These feedbacks and trade-offs are not well explored in most studies but are critical in considering community responses to changing wetland resources, in particular under climate change. This study recommends that policymakers should include small and often hitherto overlooked wetlands in their management plans, since they are critical for supporting rural livelihoods. It is also important that wetland management plans aim to improve the range and sustainability of ecosystem services available and avoid the need for unnecessary trade-offs in their use by local communities.

Life cycle assessment of the Spanish virgin olive oil production: A case study for Andalusian region	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Spain is the first olive oil producer worldwide (representing around 45%), with more than 80% of its agricultural area dedicated to this crop. The goal of this study is to assess the environmental impact of the Spanish virgin olive oil production, attending to the farming and industrial phases. A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is conducted for 5 harvests in approximately 4.000 ha of olive grove in Jaen, the largest producer region of Spain. The type of farming is the most representative in Spain: conventional (non-organic), with a medium-low slope, extensive (100-150 trees per ha) and around 60% dryland orchards. The industrial phase is based on 2-phase extraction process and olive pomace valorization. The functional unit (FU) chosen for the comparative analysis is 1 kg of unpacked virgin olive oil under a perspective from "cradle to gate". One of the most representative categories, climate change, places the average environmental impact in 2.43 kg CO2 eq/kg, while the range is between 1.93 and 3.00 kg CO2 eq/kg depending on the harvest. Huge differences between values are observed in the farming phase and they are mostly caused by the virgin olive oil yield of every harvest. The carbon sequestration analyses and the impact produced per FU ranges from 43.78% (for 15/16 harvest) to 46.36% (for 17/18). The impact hotspots detected in the farming phase, in terms of climate change potential, are the categories of plant protection products and herbicides (24.11% of the average value) and fertilizers (20.01%). However, the environmental impact of the industrial phase is relatively constant, with a value of 0.547-0.554 kg of CO2 equivalent. The 80.74% is caused by pomace valorization, which translated to the average whole value, represents the 18.56%. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Swimmers were asked to swim 50 m and 100 m freestyle to evaluate their swimming performances. Swimming performance data were measured in the form of swimming performances separately for 50 m and 100 m, 50 m freestyle kicking time (KT), stroke count (SC), stroke time (ST), distance per stroke (DPS), stroke length (SL), stroke rate (SR), heart rate (HR). Spearman correlation test was applied in order to determine the relationship between maximal strength and swimming performance (p<0.05). Significant and positive relationship was determined between butterfly & lat pull down maximal strength and HR of the female swimmers after the 100 m freestyle swimming (100 m HR & butterfly r= 0.818, p= 0.015; 100 m HR & lat pull down r= 0.754, p= 0.038); and between 100 m swimming time and maximal push-ups of the male swimmers (r= -0.707, p= 0.037). However a significant negative relationship was found between 1RM lat pull down and 50 m SC (r= -.710, p= .037), and a significant positive relationship was found between 1RM lat pull down and 50 m SL (r= .710, p= .037). No significant relationship was found between any other swimming performance and maximal strength in male and female swimmers. As a result, it is possible to suggest that lat pull down is a determining element for swimming performance. However, in dryland strength workouts (ground workout), it may be suggested that action plans may be transferred into the water.																			2322-3537					MAR	2020	9	3					89	97																WOS:000520847700010

Experiments carried out with lichen- and moss-dominated biocrusts indicate that climate change may dramatically reduce their cover and diversity. Therefore, the development of reproducible methods to monitor changes in biocrust diversity and abundance across multiple spatio-temporal scales is key for evaluating how climate change may impact biocrust communities and the myriad of ecosystem functions and services that rely on them. In this study, we collected lichen-dominated biocrust samples from a semi-arid ecosystem in central Spain. Their alpha-diversity was then evaluated using very high spatial resolution hyperspectral images (pixel size of 0.091 mm) measured in laboratory under controlled conditions. Support vector machines were used to map the biocrust composition. Traditional alpha-diversity metrics (i.e., species richness, Shannon's, Simpson's, and Pielou's indices) were calculated using lichen fractional cover data derived from their classifications in the hyperspectral imagery. Spectral diversity was calculated at different wavelength ranges as the coefficient of variation of different regions of the reflectance spectra of lichens and as the standard deviation of the continuum removal algorithm (SD_CR). The accuracy of the classifications of the images obtained was close to 100%. The results showed the best coefficient of determination (r(2) = 0.47) between SD_CR calculated at 680 nm and the alpha-diversity calculated as the Simpson's index, which includes species richness and their evenness. These findings indicate that this spectral diversity index could be used to track spatio-temporal changes in lichen-dominated biocrust communities. Thus, they are the first step to monitor alpha-diversity of biocrust-forming lichens at the ecosystem and regional levels, a key task for any program aiming to evaluate changes in biodiversity and associated ecosystem services in drylands.					de Guevara Sáez de Eguílaz, Mónica/AAQ-6778-2020; Maestre, Fernando T./A-6825-2008	de Guevara Sáez de Eguílaz, Mónica/0000-0003-2849-1801; Maestre, Fernando T./0000-0002-7434-4856														2072-4292				DEC 2	2019	11	24							2942	10.3390/rs11242942	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11242942													WOS:000507333400058

Fusarium acuminatum and F. solani are known to be major pathogens causing root rot of A. membranaceus in Shanxi Province, China. It is well-known that accurate identification of the pathogen and early diagnosis of the symptoms play a significantly important role to control this disease in the early or mid-term stage. Here, two new loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays were developed to detect F. acuminatum and F. solani based on the partial translation elongation factor-1 alpha (TEF-1 alpha) gene region. The LAMP products were successfully assessed by visual assessment using SYBR Green I, as well as electrophoresis on 2.0% agarose gel. The LAMP reactions for F. acuminatum and F. solani were performed under the optimized conditions of 63 degrees C and 62 degrees C for 60 min, respectively. The detection limit of LAMP assay was 100 fg/mu L for F. acuminatum and 1 pg/mu L for F. solani. Additionally, the two LAMP assays are highly specific to target Fusarium species, and could differentiate F. acuminatum and F. solani from other Fusarium species. In the field, the suspected diseased samples were used to verify the feasibility of the developed assays. As a result, the two rapid and specific LAMP assays could be applied for direct detection of F. acuminatum and F. solani on A. membranaceus, and precise diagnosis of A. membranaceus root rot caused by F. acuminatum and F. solani.																			0929-1873	1573-8469				JUN	2022	163	2					305	320		10.1007/s10658-022-02478-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-022-02478-x		APR 2022											WOS:000781776900001
J	Yao, YF; Shao, MA; Fu, XL; Wang, X; Wei, XR				Yao, Yufei; Shao, Mingan; Fu, Xiaoli; Wang, Xiang; Wei, Xiaorong			Effect of grassland afforestation on soil N mineralization and its response to soil texture and slope position	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Grassland afforestation, which is a major form of land-use change, has expanded considerably in the last few decades. However, the effect of conversion from grassland to shrubland on soil nitrogen (N) cycling and availability with regard to soil textures and slope positions is unclear. This lack of clarity has hindered our understanding of how grassland afforestation influences soil N availability and transformation on a larger spatial scale. In this study, we compared the net N mineralization rates and mineral N concentrations in soils from native grassland and under legume shrub (Caragana korshinskii Kom.) with contrasting soil textures (sandy-loam vs. loamy-sand) and slope positions (upper vs. lower) in the northern region of China's Loess Plateau. The objective of this study is to understand how soil texture and slope position regulate the response of soil N cycling to grassland afforestation. The results showed that the concentrations of soil nitrate and total mineral N and the rates of net nitrification and mineralization were higher in soils under shrub (0.64 +/- 0.10 g N m(-2), 1.01 +/- 0.11 g N m(-2), 23.19 +/- 5.22 mg N m(-2) d(-1) and 22.07 +/- 5.44 mg(-2) N m(-2) d(-1)) than in grassland (0.22 +/- 0.03 g N m(-2), 0.56 +/- 0.04 g N m(-2), 1.48 +/- 1.51 mg N m(-2) and 1.36 +/- 1.96 mg N m(-2) d(-1)). However, soil ammonium concentration and net ammonification rate were not affected by grassland afforestation. The effect of afforestation on nitrate and total mineral N concentrations was greater in the lower slope than in the upper slope but was similar between the sandy-loam and loamy-sand soils. The effect of this land-use change on net nitrification and mineralization rates varied with soil texture and slope position, with greater effects in the upper slope than in the lower slope in more clayey soils, but with the opposite influencing pattern in more sandy soils. These results suggested that planting G. korshinskii in grassland ecosystems increased soil N mineralization and availability. More importantly, soil texture and slope position should be considered when assessing the effects of grassland afforestation in complex landscape conditions.

This study assessed spatio-temporal changes of gully length and density in watershed pairs in Guder, Aba Gerima, and Dibatie sites, which are representative highland, midland, and lowland agro-ecologies in the Upper Blue Nile basin of Ethiopia. Aerial photographs (1957, 1982) and very high resolution satellite images (QuickBird, IKONOS, Worldview-2, SPOT-7, and Pleiades) of the six watersheds, along with field survey results, were used in the analyses. The aerial photographs were scanned and orthorectified using ENVI 4.3 image analysis software, and gullies were mapped by visual image interpretation in the ArcGIS environment. Rates of increase in gully length in Guder (36.9 m yr(-1)) and Aba Gerima (33.6 m yr(-1)) were almost double the rate in Dibatie (17.8 m yr(-1)) from 1957 to 2016 or 2017, and over the same period, gully density similarly increased by 5.9, 5.4, and 3.7 m ha(-1) in Guder, Aba Gerima, and Dibatie, respectively. The higher rates in Guder and Aba Gerima reflect the long history of cultivation and human settlement in those sites, whereas agricultural activity became widespread in Dibatie only after implementation of the national resettlement program in the 1980s. Moreover, although gully density tended to increase over time in all six watersheds, in the three watersheds (one in each paired watershed) where soil and water conservation measures had been introduced, the rate of increase was lower than in those where no such measures were implemented. In addition, gully distribution was linked to land use and landscape position; gully density was higher in cultivated areas and where slope gradients were gentle. The results of this study indicate that careful site-specific identification of factors controlling gully initiation and development is crucial so that appropriate management strategies can be developed for these three sites and for other areas with similar agro-ecologies in the Upper Blue Nile basin.

Intra-household roles and explanatory models for sourcing soybean seed from the formal sector in Malawi	OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE												This study asks whether there is utility in knowing who sources soybean seed within the household and why when explaining variation in seed obtained from the formal versus informal sector. Survey data collected in Malawi in 2018 were used to explore the question. Results suggest that the identity of the person who sources seed has little to do with whether the seed was obtained from the formal sector. Instead, why the person sources soybean seed is the better predictor. As formal seed system actors mobilize to persuade more smallholder farmers to adopt improved varieties, understanding why people source seed may be key for targeting and when designing agricultural development interventions.

However, a knowledge gap exists on the spatial variability of root-zone soil moisture at the regional scale in arid and hyperarid regions. Thus, soil moisture measurements at 142 sites were taken in Xinjiang (northwest China), and the relationships between soil moisture and 19 environmental factors were analyzed. The results showed that both absolute gravitational soil water content (SWC) and relative extractable water (REW) increased with increasing soil depth in the 0-100 cm soil profile. It generally decreased in the order of cropland > forestland > grassland > shrubland > bare land. Semivariograms suggested that SWC had moderate spatial dependence over a large range of 473-558 km, and REW was more randomly distributed at the regional scale in Xinjiang. Redundancy analysis suggested that environmental factors could explain 47.5%-50.9% of the variability of soil moisture, which was more strongly driven by land surface factors (p < 0.01) than by climatic factors (p > 0.05). Soil properties and other local variables explained, respectively, 40.7% and 32.3% of the variability of soil moisture in the 0-100 cm soil profile. Soil properties independently accounted for 12.8% and 28.1% of the variability in soil moisture in the 0-50 and 50-100 cm soil layers, respectively. Soil texture, field capacity, wilting point, organic carbon, bulk density, land use, and normalized difference vegetation index were the dominant factors influencing soil moisture variations.																			0008-4271	1918-1841				SEP	2019	99	3					277	291		10.1139/cjss-2019-0006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjss-2019-0006													WOS:000484119400005

However, the effects of ongoing climate warming and N deposition on grassland spring phenology and how abiotic and biotic factors modulate such effects remain unclear. Here, we conducted a factorial field experiment of warming and N addition in three types of grasslands with varying aridity indices (0.20-0.39) in Inner Mongolia, China. Our results showed that warming and the combination of warming plus N addition had similar effects on start of season (SOS). These treatments delayed SOS by 3-5 weeks in low-, moderate and high-aridity grasslands in both wet (2018) and dry (2019) years, except that they advanced SOS by -1 week in low-aridity grassland in the wet year. N addition alone slightly advanced or delayed SOS by 2-5 days depending on the grassland type. The magnitude and direction of SOS response to warming and warming plus N addition were closely and linearly correlated to grassland soil moisture, but not to air temperature or soil N availability. Warming-induced reduction in soil moisture drove SOS by affecting species richness and/or functional group composition. By contrast, N addition-induced changes in species richness and functional group composition did not alter the SOS. These combined results indicate that temperature and soil water availability are primary factors regulating SOS in semiarid grasslands. Our findings suggest that annual variation and spatial distribution in soil moisture should be considered in future studies of climate warming and environmental effects on grassland phenology.

Many nutrient addition and warming experiments have been conducted in grasslands; however, the global pattern of nutrient addition and experimental warming impacts on soil P cycle is unclear. Methods We conducted a meta-analysis of 68 publications to synthesize the mechanisms underlying global grassland ecosystem responses to nutrient addition and experimental warming. Results Our analysis indicated that nitrogen (N) addition reduced microbial biomass P (- 11.2%) but increased litter P concentration (+ 15.5%) and available P (+ 14.2%). Experimental warming reduced microbial biomass P (- 10.5%) and available P (- 6.7%) but increased litter P concentration (+ 46.2%). P addition increased available P (+ 222.3%) and microbial biomass P (+ 98.1%). The available P response to nutrient addition and experimental warming was more sensitive in temperate grasslands than in alpine grasslands. The responses of soil total and available P to nutrient addition depended on environmental conditions such as air temperature and soil pH. Conclusion Our results suggest that N addition may promote P mineralization and possibly stimulate the transformation of refractory or resistant forms of soil inorganic P, whereas experimental warming accelerates the P cycle by regulating plant acquisition and enzyme activity. Environmental factors (e.g., temperature, precipitation, pH) affect the soil P response to nutrient addition by altering microbial and enzymatic activities. It is crucial to understand the dynamic changes in soil microbial and enzyme activities to predict the P cycle in grassland soils in the future.																			1439-0108	1614-7480				OCT	2022	22	10					2608	2619		10.1007/s11368-022-03276-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-022-03276-y		JUL 2022											WOS:000823335000001

Using Narratives to Understand Farming Households' Aspirations in Meru, Kenya	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH												In the limited research on farming aspirations, little attention has been paid to the narratives which frame and shape them, and the ways in which the aspirations of those who farm intersect with the goals of extension services. Drawing on multimethod research conducted in Meru County, Kenya, we demonstrate how aspirations are not only situated within a consideration of personal circumstances, but are shaped in crucial ways by networks of relations and by the perceived possibilities afforded by material and cultural resources. We further highlight the accounts of state extension agents that link a lack of engagement with the desires and needs of those who farm to the failure of agricultural development initiatives. We argue that an engagement with aspirations opens up a route to understanding the obstacles and potentialities that matter to those who farm and, as such, might enable more responsive development initiatives centred on the perceptions and desires of those who farm.

Understanding the genetic basis of these traits could accelerate the breeding of high yield wheat varieties. In this study, we constructed a doubled haploid (DH) population and analyzed flag-leaf-related traits in five experimental locations/years using the wheat 90K single-nucleotide polymorphism array. It's worth noting that a novel method was used to measure FLT and FLV easily. Leaf thickness at two-thirds of the leaf length from tip to collar represented the average leaf thickness as measured with freehand sections and was used to calculate the leaf volume. In addition, flag-leaf-related traits showed positive correlations with yield related traits under two different water regimes. A total of 79 quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling the five traits were detected among all chromosomes except 4D and 5A, explaining 3.09-14.52% of the phenotypic variation. Among them, 15 stable QTL were identified in more than three environments, including two major QTL for FLT, six for FLW, three for FLA, two for FLT and two for FLV. DH lines with positive alleles at both QTL regions had an average FLL (9.90%), FLW (32.87%), FLT (6.62%), FLA (18.47%), and FLV (20.87%) greater than lines with contrasting alleles. QFLT-2B, QFLV-2A, and QFLV-7D were co-located with yield-related traits. The 15 QTL were validated by tightly linked kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASP) markers in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a different cross. QFLL-4A, QFLW-4B, QFLA-5D.1, QFLA-7A, QFLA-7D.1, QFLT-2B, QFLT-6A, QFLV-2A, and QFLV-7D are likely novel loci. These results provide a better understanding of the genetic basis underlying flag-leaf-related traits. Also, target regions for fine mapping and marker-assisted selection were identified and these will be valuable for breeding high yielding bread wheat.					li, pengbo/HJZ-5072-2023														1664-462X					SEP 8	2022	13								990287	10.3389/fpls.2022.990287	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.990287								36160981					WOS:000859758500001

Herein, a low-cost adsorbent (calcium-rich biochar) was developed, which was directly pyrolyzed from spent mushroom substate without any modification. This study evaluated the potential application of two calcium-rich biochars (GSBC and LSBC) derived from spent substrates of Ganoderma lucidum and Lentinus edodes, respectively. The effects of pyrolysis temperature on the calcium-rich biochars characteristics and their adsorption mechanism for cationic dyes (Malachite Green oxalate (MG) and Safranine T (ST)) were studied systematically. The increase in pyrolysis temperature from 350 to 750 & DEG;C led to an increase in both biochar ash, Ca content, and specific surface area, which made high-temperature biochars (GS750 and LS750) the superior adsorbents for cationic dyes. Batch adsorption results showed LS750 was more efficient to adsorb dyes than GS750 attributed to its higher Ca content and larger specific surface area. According to the Langmuir model, LS750 had high adsorption capacities of 9,388.04 and 3,871.48 mg g(-1) for Malachite green and ST, respectively. The adsorption mechanism of dye MG could be attributed to pore filling, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interaction, ion exchange, and pi-pi stacking, while ST adsorption mainly involved pore filling, electrostatic interaction, ion exchange, and pi-pi stacking. Attributed to their excellent adsorption performance, cheap source, and good reusability, biochars obtained from SMSs were very promising in dyeing wastewater treatment.

FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Foliar fungal diseases especially late leaf spot (LLS) and rust are the important production constraints across the peanut growing regions of the world. A set of 340 diverse peanut genotypes that includes accessions from gene bank of International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), elite breeding lines from the breeding program, and popular cultivars were screened for LLS and rust resistance and yield traits across three locations in India under natural and artificial disease epiphytotic conditions. The study revealed significant variation among the genotypes for LLS and rust resistance at different environments. Combined analysis of variance revealed significant environment (E) and genotype x environment (GxE) interactions for both the diseases indicating differential response of genotypes in different environments. The present study reported 31 genotypes as resistant to LLS and 66 to rust across the locations at 90 DAS with maturity duration 103 to 128 days. Twenty-eight genotypes showed resistance to both the diseases across the locations, of which 19 derived from A. cardenasii, five from A. hypogaea, and four from A. villosa. Site regression and Genotype by Genotype x Environment (GGE) biplot analysis identified eight genotypes as stable for LLS, 24 for rust and 14 for pod yield under disease pressure across the environments. Best performing environment specific genotypes were also identified. Nine genotypes resistant to LLS and rust showed 77% to 120% increase in pod yield over control under disease pressure with acceptable pod and kernel features that can be used as potential parents in LLS and rust resistance breeding. Pod yield increase as a consequence of resistance offered to foliar fungal diseases suggests the possibility of considering 'foliar fungal disease resistance' as a must-have trait in all the peanut cultivars that will be released for cultivation in rainfed ecologies in Asia and Africa. The phenotypic data of the present study will be used for designing genomic selection prediction models in peanut.

Pathogenic variability amongst Indian isolates of <i>Magnaporthe grisea</i> causing blast in pearl millet	CROP PROTECTION												Blast disease caused by Magnaporthe grisea is a major biotic constraint to the production of pearl millet in India. The pathogen is highly variable in nature, but isolates are mostly specific in their host range. Pathogenic variation among 80 M. grisea isolates collected from major pearl millet growing states in India was studied on pearl millet host differentials (ICMB 93333-P1, ICMB 95444, ICMB 97222-P1, ICMB 01333, ICMB 02444, ICMR 06444, 863B-P2, ICMR 06222, ICMR 11003 and IP 21187-P1) under greenhouse conditions. Based on reaction of isolates on host differentials (virulent = score >= 4 and avirulent = score <= 3 on a 1-to-9 scale), 80 isolates were clustered into 14 pathogenic groups. Based on the virulence profiling, isolates Pg 138, Pg 186, Pg 204, and Pg 232 representing different pathogenic groups, and collected from different states have been selected for greenhouse screening of pearl millet lines for blast resistance.																			0261-2194	1873-6904				JAN	2021	139								105372	10.1016/j.cropro.2020.105372	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2020.105372													WOS:000582806100025

While lipids may be involved in plant tolerance/sensitivity to Al, the role of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) in Al response remains unknown. In this study, Arabidopsis MGDG synthase (AtMGD) mutants (mgd1, mgd2 and mgd3) and wild-type (Col-0) plants were treated with AlCl3; the effect of aluminium on root growth, aluminium distribution, plasma membrane integrity, lipid peroxidation, hydrogen peroxide content and membrane lipid compositions were analysed. Under Al stress, mgd mutants exhibited a more severe root growth inhibition, plasma membrane integrity damage and lipid peroxidation compared to Col-0. Al accumulation in root tips showed no difference between Col-0 and mutants under Al stress. Lipid analysis demonstrated that under Al treatment the MGDG content in all plants and MGDG/DGDG (digalactosyldiacylglycerol) remarkably reduced, especially in mutants impairing the stability and permeability of the plasma membrane. These results indicate that the Arabidopsis mgd mutants are hypersensitive to Al stress due to the reduction in MGDG content, and this is of great significance in the discovery of effective measures for plants to inhibit aluminium toxicity.

Hermetic bags, being promoted in Ethiopia, could be viable alternatives to traditional methods and insecticides that are commonly used by farmers to store grain. However, the economics and determinants behind farmers' decisions to use different storage methods are poorly understood. This study sought to ascertain the economics of hermetic grain storage technology among 450 representative small-scale maize farmers in northwestern Ethiopia. Gross margin (GM), and the marginal rate of return (MRR) were employed to estimate the economic costs and benefits of storage methods, while a multivariate probit regression model was employed to analyze the determinants of farmers' decision to store maize with a given storage method. The results show that farmers used a combination of different storage techniques: 19.6% did not store grain, 87.8% used traditional methods with pesticide, and 66.7% used Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) hermetic bags. Farmers who used hermetic bags also used other mentioned storage techniques. PICS had the highest GM (US$21.77 100 kg(-1)) and MRR (3.196), indicating that they were the most profitable. Moreover, a household could obtain an additional net cash flow of US$5.02 100 kg(-1) PICS bag per season after 9.6 months of storage. Farmers' decisions to use PICS bags were influenced by several factors including access to information, the initial cost, and storage capacity of the technology. Thus, increasing awareness and improving supply chain efficiency to reduce the cost of the PICS bags would improve adoption rates.

Of 13 elements analyzed, Ba ranged from 0.2 to 8.9 mg kg(-1), Ca from 186.4 to 977.5 mg kg(-1), Cu from 1.5 to 9.8 mg kg(-1), K from 353.2 to 7721.5 mg kg(-1), Mg from 1049.8 to 2024.2 mg kg(-1), Mn from 8.1 to 22.9 mg kg(-1), Na from 55.9 to 627.9 mg kg(-1), P from 2272.9 to 5428.8 mg kg(-1), S from 880.7 to 1898.0 mg kg(-1), Si from 19.1 to 663.2 mg kg(-1), and Sr from 0.35 to 2.62 mg kg(-1) in the barley grain. The least square means showed high Zn, Fe, Mg, P, and S concentration in AM-64 and AM-228 genotypes. The principal component analysis of element concentration showed four PCs explained 64.3% total variance. Strong positive correlations (p < 0.001) of Fe-Mn, Fe-S, S-Mn, Zn-P, Zn-Mg, Mg-P, Mg-Mn, and Ca-Sr were found.

By examining how earthworms regulate plants' effects on microbial nutrient limitations under contrasting soil types and moisture conditions, we showed that plant presence reduced microbial carbon (C) limitation and such reduction was enhanced by earthworm. Plant presence increased soil microbial phosphorus (P) limitation in soils with earthworms in most cases. Additionally, the effects of plants on microbial nutrient limitations and their responses to earthworms were dependent on soil type (or soil nutrients) and moisture. These results suggested that earthworms have the po-tential to reduce soil microbial C limitation but enhance P limitation and highlighted the importance of nutrients and moisture in influencing the effects of earthworms and plants on microbial nutrient limitations.																			0301-4797	1095-8630				MAR 1	2023	329								117061	10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.117061	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.117061		DEC 2022						36563447					WOS:000921044700001

Effects of plastic and straw mulching on soil microbial P limitations in maize fields: Dependency on soil organic carbon demonstrated by ecoenzymatic stoichiometry	GEODERMA												Mulching rain-fed farmland ecosystems changes the soil physicochemical properties, especially soil organic carbon (SOC), but the metabolic limitations of soil microorganisms after these changes are unclear. We established a long-term experiment in 2012 with three treatments: no mulch (CK), straw mulch (SM), and plastic film mulch (FM). In 2019 the soil enzyme activities were measured in five maize growing periods: planting time, six-leaf period, silking period, milk period, and physiological maturity. Extracellular enzymatic stoichiometry models were used to examine microbial metabolic limitations. The vector length and angle were employed to determine the C and N/P limitations of soil microorganisms. Compared with CK, the average SOC and total nitrogen (TN) contents were 9.7% and 7.8% higher under SM, respectively, in each period. The SOC, TN, and total phosphorus (TP) contents were 5.6%, 4.8%, and 2.8% lower under FM, respectively. Compared with CK, the C- and N-acquiring enzyme activities were 20.5% and 5.2% lower under FM, respectively. The alkaline phosphatase enzyme activities were 2.7% and 13.5% higher under SM and FM, respectively, than CK. Soil nutrients, pH, and temperature influenced the C and P limitations of soil microorganisms. The different P limitation responses under SM and FM were mainly due to SOM. The decomposition of SOC was a key source of soil available P. The soil hydrothermal conditions under FM accelerated the decomposition of SOC in the early years, thereby increasing the P limitation. However, long-term SM increased the SOC due to the annual input of straw and its decomposition released available P to alleviate the P limitation for microorganisms. Thus, the temperature, water, pH, and SOC affect the P limitation for microbes under mulching conditions, but the SOC content of alkaline soil in arid farmland is the main factor that leads to microbial P limitation.

Modeling Planting-Date Effects on Intermediate-Maturing Maize in Contrasting Environments in the Nigerian Savanna: An Application of DSSAT Model	AGRONOMY-BASEL												The Crop Environment Resource Synthesis (CERES)-Maize model in Decision Support System for Agricultural Technology Transfer (DSSAT) was calibrated and evaluated with experimental data for simulation of response of two intermediate-maturing maize varieties to different sowing dates in the Nigerian savannas. The calibration experiments involved 14 consecutive field trials conducted in the rainy and dry seasons in Bayero University Kano (BUK), Dambatta, and Zaria between 2014-2019. Two sets of field experiments were conducted simultaneously for model evaluation in Iburu in the southern Guinea savanna zone and Zaria in the northern Guinea savanna zone during 2015 and 2016 cropping seasons. The experiments for calibration had two maize (SAMMAZ-15 and SAMMAZ-16) varieties planted under optimum conditions with no water and nutrients stresses. The trials for model evaluation were conducted using the same varieties under four different nitrogen (N) rates (0, 60, 120 and 180 kg N ha(-1)). A 30-year (1985-2014) term simulation was performed to determine effect of varying sowing dates on yields of two maize varieties (SAMMAZ-15 and SAMMAZ-16) in the Sudan savanna (SS), northern Guinea savanna (NGS), and southern Guinea savanna (SGS) zones. The calibration results showed that the cultivar coefficients of the two maize varieties resulted in simulated growth and development parameters that were in good agreement with observed parameters. Model evaluation showed a good agreement between simulated and observed data for phenology and growth of maize. This demonstrated the potential of the CERES-Maize model to simulate growth and yield of maize in the Nigeria savannas. Results of 30-year sensitivity analysis with 9 different sowing windows showed that in SS, sowing the intermediate maize varieties from early to mid-June produced the highest grain yields. In NGS, the optimum sowing windows were found between late June and late July for the both varieties. In SGS, the optimum sowing window is from early June to late July for SAMMAZ-15 and mid-June to late July for SAMMAZ-16. These planting windows gave the highest long-term average yields for each variety. The variety SAMMAZ-15 was found to be best performing across the three agro-ecologies. Maize performance was generally higher in NGS than in SGS. SS in the Sudan savanna recorded the lowest yield compared with other locations.

Why invest in Research & Development for sorghum and millets? The business case for East and Southern Africa	GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY-AGRICULTURE POLICY ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT												This article synthesizes recent research by ICRISAT and its partners to analyse the business case for sorghum and millets in ESA and the wider strategy of commercialization on which this is based. The business case is stronger for sorghum because of its greater impact on poverty and food security, but millets are better suited to a strategy of commercialization. Commercial demand for millets is primarily driven by specialty markets for flour while that for sorghum is limited to beer. Demand for improved varieties is driven primarily by the need for early - maturity that shortens the hungry period. Future growth in production depends on increased opportunities for inter-regional trade.

PLANTS-BASEL												Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a critical superfamily of multifunctional enzymes in plants. As a ligand or binding protein, GSTs regulate plant growth and development and detoxification. Foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv) could respond to abiotic stresses through a highly complex multi-gene regulatory network in which the GST family is also involved. However, GST genes have been scarcely studied in foxtail millet. Genome-wide identification and expression characteristics analysis of the foxtail millet GST gene family were conducted by biological information technology. The results showed that 73 GST genes (SiGSTs) were identified in the foxtail millet genome and were divided into seven classes. The chromosome localization results showed uneven distribution of GSTs on the seven chromosomes. There were 30 tandem duplication gene pairs belonging to 11 clusters. Only one pair of SiGSTU1 and SiGSTU23 were identified as fragment duplication genes. A total of ten conserved motifs were identified in the GST family of foxtail millet. The gene structure of SiGSTs is relatively conservative, but the number and length of exons of each gene are still different. The cis-acting elements in the promoter region of 73 SiGST genes showed that 94.5% of SiGST genes possessed defense and stress-responsive elements. The expression profiles of 37 SiGST genes covering 21 tissues suggested that most SiGST genes were expressed in multiple organs and were highly expressed in roots and leaves. By qPCR analysis, we found that 21 SiGST genes were responsive to abiotic stresses and abscisic acid (ABA). Taken together, this study provides a theoretical basis for identifying foxtail millet GST family information and improving their responses to different stresses.

RIL Mapping Population from TAM 113 x Gallagher	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Understanding genetic architectures of yield and yield-related traits of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown under dryland or irrigated conditions is pivotal for developing modern high-yielding germplasm and cultivars. The objectives of this study were to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) linked to yield and yield components using a mapping population derived from 'TAM 113'/'Gallagher', including 191 recombinant inbred lines (RILs). The population was grown in McGregor, College Station, and Bushland, Texas, for three consecutive years from 2019 to 2021. A high-density genetic map covering all 21 chromosomes was constructed using a set of 8,075 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). A total of 147 QTLs for 16 yield-related traits were identified, which included 16 QTLs consistently detected in multiple experiments and 8 QTLs that showed pleiotropic effects. Of them, five pleiotropic QTLs overlapped with the consistent QTL. They increased grain yield (YLD) up to 37.64 g m(-2), thousand kernel weight (TKW) up to 1.33 g, harvest (HI) up to 0.97%, kernel length up to 0.08 mm, and kernel width up to 0.04 mm with Gallagher alleles and increased YLD up to 22.21 g m(-2), kernels spike(-1) up to 1.77, TKW up to 1.14 g, and HI up to 3.72% with TAM 113 alleles. One major and consistent QTL on chromosome 2D at 34.4 Mbp overlapped with the major photoperiod gene Ppd-D1 and was affected by multiple traits, including kernel diameter (DIAM), TKW, kernel hardness index (KHI), heading date (HD), and plant height (PH). Another QTL cluster region on 7D between 52 and 66 Mbp, encompassing one consistent and three pleiotropic QTLs. One of the pleiotropic QTLs at 52 Mbp increased YLD up to 24.16 g m(-2), HI up to 1%, and DIAM up to 0.03 mm. This study dissected genetic loci associated with yield and yield-related traits, providing valuable information on wheat improvement using marker-assisted selection (MAS).						chu, chenggen/0000-0001-6189-5985; Yu, Shuhao/0000-0003-2955-1503; DOGAN, Mehmet/0000-0003-4786-2196														2073-4395				SEP	2023	13	9							2402	10.3390/agronomy13092402	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13092402													WOS:001079876000001
J	Yang, R; Harrison, MT; Wang, XY				Yang, Rui; Harrison, Matthew Tom; Wang, Xiaoyan			Current State and Limiting Factors of Wheat Yield at the Farm Level in Hubei Province	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Longitudinal wheat yields in China have declined in recent times due to climate change, more frequent natural disasters, and suboptimal agronomic management. To date, it has been unclear which factors have predominated yield penalties realised hitherto in Hubei Province. This study aimed to identify key factors limiting wheat production across systems and agroecological regions, and provide a basis for increasing crop production while engendering food security. Survey data from 791 households in Hubei Province were analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression. Significant spatial heterogeneity in average wheat yields was observed, with the Jianghan Plain region having significantly lower yields compared with the northwest region (yield gap: 1125 kg.hm(-2)). Dryland wheat had higher average yields than rice-rotation wheat (yield gap: 134 to 575 kg.hm(-2)). Socioeconomic factors, cultivation management measures, and environmental factors contributed differently to yield differences. Input costs and economic benefits were key social factors influencing wheat production. Variation in management were mainly attributed to planting methods, while soil fertility and climatic factors limited yields in some regions. In the northwest, low soil fertility and susceptibility to drought and high temperatures had greater influence on yields. In the Jianghan Plain, soil waterlogging and erosion were key challenges. Waterlogging increased the probability of low yields by 8.6 times, while severe soil erosion increased probability of yield loss by a factor of almost five. Low-yield farms in the Jianghan Plain were 21% higher than those in the northwest. Extreme weather events also contributed to low yields in the Jianghan Plain. We note significant potential for increasing farm-level wheat production in Hubei Province, with large existing differences across agro-ecological regions and planting modes. Differences in cultivation practices was a major driving factor of yield gaps between planting modes, while soil fertility and meteorological disasters drive regional yield differences. These results have implications for those aspiring to narrow the yield gap across regions and increase production of cereal crops.																				2073-4395				AUG	2023	13	8							2043	10.3390/agronomy13082043	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13082043													WOS:001056757900001

Beauv.) landraces revealed remarkable variability of morpho-physiological, yield, and yield-related traits	FRONTIERS IN GENETICS												Foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv.) is highly valued for nutritional traits, stress tolerance and sustainability in resource-poor dryland agriculture. However, the low productivity of this crop in semi-arid regions of Southern India, is further threatened by climate stress. Landraces are valuable genetic resources, regionally adapted in form of novel alleles that are responsible for cope up the adverse conditions used by local farmers. In recent years, there is an erosion of genetic diversity. We have hypothesized that plant genetic resources collected from the semi-arid climatic zone would serve as a source of novel alleles for the development of climate resilience foxtail millet lines with enhanced yield. Keeping in view, there is an urgent need for conservation of genetic resources. To explore the genetic diversity, to identify superior genotypes and novel alleles, we collected a heterogeneous mixture of foxtail millet landraces from farmer fields. In an extensive multi-year study, we developed twenty genetically fixed foxtail millet landraces by single seed descent method. These landraces characterized along with four released cultivars with agro-morphological, physiological, yield and yield-related traits assessed genetic diversity and population structure. The landraces showed significant diversity in all the studied traits. We identified landraces S3G5, Red, Black and S1C1 that showed outstanding grain yield with earlier flowering, and maturity as compared to released cultivars. Diversity analysis using 67 simple sequence repeat microsatellite and other markers detected 127 alleles including 11 rare alleles, averaging 1.89 alleles per locus, expected heterozygosity of 0.26 and an average polymorphism information content of 0.23, collectively indicating a moderate genetic diversity in the landrace populations. Euclidean Ward's clustering, based on the molecular markers, principal coordinate analysis and structure analysis concordantly distinguished the genotypes into two to three sub-populations. A significant phenotypic and genotypic diversity observed in the landraces indicates a diverse gene pool that can be utilized for sustainable foxtail millet crop improvement.

Targeting largely marginalized rural women with bio-reclamation of degraded land (BDL) technologies restores their rights to earn a livelihood through agriculture. This study examines the determinants and impacts of land-enhancing technology on women farmers in Niger. Data were collected from 1,205 randomly selected women farmers in the Maradi and Zinder regions. The sample included 69% of participants into BDL program and 31% of non-participants. To account for selection bias from observable and unobservable factors, an endogenous switching regression (ESR) model was used to estimate the impact of BDL technology on women's household income. A simple probit model was used to analyze the determinants of participation. The results show that key determinants of participation in BDL include income level before participation in BDL, household size, age of participants, number of women in the household, number of children under 5 years old, sex of household head, age of household head, and institutional support. Participation in BDL positively influences participants' income (+14%); non-participants may not benefit from participating as they would probably lose 31% of their income, and the impact of participation in BDL varies widely across regions. Before the advent of BDL, the income of non-participants was higher than that of participants by 25%. It can be inferred that BDL is a pro-poor technology that is not beneficial to all women farmers. This study makes a critical contribution to the literature on land-enhancing technologies. It suggests that the impact of land-enhancing technologies, such as BDL, is closely linked to spatial, economic, environmental, temporal, and cultural contexts. Accordingly, land-enhancing technologies should target locations with large percentages of degraded farmlands and the poorest farmers. These results contribute to food security and poverty alleviation policies in rural dryland areas.

Due to global climate change, rising temperatures are causing changes in global air circulation patterns. Therefore, more extreme drought and flood events will happen in the future. Xerophytic shrubs are the main vegetation types of dryland ecosystems and are expected to be sensitive to changes in rainfall, which would inevitably affect the stability of the ecosystem. We conducted field experiments to simulate the effects of rainfall on Artemisia ordosica Krasch annual net primary productivity (ANPP) and allocation in the Mu Us Desert in northern China. This study examined six different rainfall levels: natural rainfall level (control); natural rainfall level reduced by 30%, 50%, and 70% (-30%, -50%, -70% treatment); and natural rainfall level increased by 30% and 50% (+30%, +50% treatment). The plant height, cover/volume, size/number of vegetative and reproductive twigs, and dry weight of vegetative and reproductive twigs were measured. The results showed the following: (1) Twig size and number are more sensitive to rainfall changes than the cover/volume of this species. (2) Rainfall has a significant influence on shrub ANPP (maximum ANPP was reached at + 30% treatment, and the minimum value was reached at -70% treatment). (3) With the increase or decrease of rainfall, A. ordosica number of twigs increased, and the length became shorter. (4) Rainfall had a significant effect on ANPP allocation (vegetative growth and reproductive growth). With the increase or decrease of rainfall, vegetative growth and reproductive growth of A. ordosica showed a trade-off strategy. Under the condition of adding rainfall, vegetative twig ANPP increased significantly. Under severe drought stress (-70% treatment), ANPP decreased significantly. Adding or subtracting rainfall caused a significant decrease in the vegetative twig ANPP ratio and a significant increase in the reproduction twig ANPP ratio. Our results highlight the sensitivity of twig size and number as indicators of shrub production estimation and the mechanism underpinning desert shrub ANPP response to global environmental changes.

The three ET models were the Simple Terrestrial Hydrosphere model (SiTH) developed by our team, the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory model (PT-JPL), and the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ET algorithm (MOD16). Comparing the observed with simulated monthly ET by the three models over 43 Fluxnet sites, we found that SiTH overestimated ET for forests with mean slope from 1.25 to 1.67, but it performed better than the other two models over short vegetation. MOD16 and PT-JPL models simulated well for forests but poorly in dryland biomes (slope = 0.25 similar to 0.55; R-2 = 0.02 similar to 0.46). At the catchment scale, all models performed well, except for some tropical and high latitudinal catchments, with NSE values lower than 0 and RMSE and MAE values far beyond their mean values. At the global scale, SiTH highly overestimated ET in tropics, while PT-JPL slightly underestimated ET between 30 degrees N and 60 degrees N and MOD16 underestimated ET between 15 degrees S and 30 degrees S. Generally, the PT-JPL provided the better performance than SiTH and MOD16 models. This study also revealed that the estimated ET by SiTH and especially PT-JPL model were influenced by the uncertainty in meteorological data, and the estimated ET was performed better using MERRA-2 datasets for PT-JPL and using ERA5 datasets for SiTH. While the estimated ET by MOD16 were relatively sensitive to LAI data. In addition, our results suggested that the GLOBMAP and GIMMS datasets were more suitable for long-term ET simulations than the GLASS dataset.					chen, hui/HDO-2955-2022	Zhu, Gaofeng/0000-0002-3533-9106; Zhang, Kun/0000-0002-3682-8382; Chen, Huiling/0000-0003-4709-0851														2072-4292				AUG	2020	12	15							2473	10.3390/rs12152473	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12152473													WOS:000559525100001
J	Liu, Y; Li, Y				Liu, Yu; Li, Ya			Synergy and trade-off between carbon sequestration and soil water balance: impact of revegetation choices	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Revegetation is an effective measure for preventing land degradation and for mitigating climate change by reducing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. However, vegetation cover is also generally considered to be a cause of a dried soil layer in drylands. The trade-off between soil water storage and soil carbon sequestration along a precipitation gradient in dryland ecosystems is well known, but the contributions of revegetation measures on the variations in the trade-off between carbon sequestration and soil water resource maintenance in soil profiles are often ignored. In this study, the trade-off and synergy between soil moisture content (SMC) maintenance and soil organic carbon (SOC) improvement in soil profiles on a semiarid hillslope are investigated in the context of revegetation choices. Three revegetation choices were selected for the comparative analysis: (a) afforestation using single tree species (Robinia pseudoacacia); (b) mixed tree species (R. pseudoacacia and Hippophae rhamnoides Linn); and (c) a mosaic of single tree bands (R. pseudoacacia, Armeniaca vulgaris, and H. rhamnoides Linn). Our results reveal a shift of synergy to trade-off at a depth of around 10-30 cm and a weakened trade-off between the middle (30-40 cm) and deep soil layers. For afforestation using a single tree species, there is a trade-off between SOC improvement and SMC promotion, as indicated by a negative correlation between the relative benefit of SOC and the relative benefit of SMC. For revegetation using mixed tree species and a mosaic of tree bands, positive correlations appeared. We draw two conclusions from these results: first, a shift in the trade-off and synergy between SMC maintenance and SOC improvement exists in soil profiles after revegetation on this semiarid hillslope; second, revegetation choices matter when reconciling the trade-off between SMC maintenance and SOC improvement. Revegetation with a single tree species (R. pseudoacacia) is not a good choice. When discussing the trade-off between carbon sequestration and soil water resource conservation in water-limited regions, more attention should be paid to site-level mechanisms and revegetation choices.

J	Zhou, Y; Zhang, L; Xiao, JF; Williams, CA; Vitkovskaya, I; Bao, AM				Zhou, Yu; Zhang, Li; Xiao, Jingfeng; Williams, Christopher A.; Vitkovskaya, Irina; Bao, Anming			Spatiotemporal transition of institutional and socioeconomic impacts on vegetation productivity in Central Asia over last three decades	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Central Asia experienced substantial institutional and socioeconomic changes during the last few decades, especially the Soviet Union collapse in 1991. It remains unclear how these profound changes impacted vegetation productivity across space and time. This study used the satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and gridded climate data to examine the institutional and socioeconomic impacts on vegetation productivity in Central Asia in 1982-2015. The improved Residual Trend (ResTREND) algorithm was used to calculate NDVI residuals (NDV1,) that reflect the impacts of human factors by excluding the influences of multiple climate factors. Our results showed that 45.7% of the vegetated areas experienced significant transitions (p < 0.05) in NDV1, with turning point (TP), of which 83.8% occurred after 1992 except for the Aral Sea Basin. During the pre-TP period, positive NDVIres (i.e., positive impact) and increasing trends (i.e., positive tendency) were predominant, accounting for 31.6% and 165% of the vegetated land, respectively. This was attribute to the expanded cultivation due to Virgin Lands Campaign in North Kazakhstan region and the Amu Darya and Syr Darya Basins. However, the institutional and socioeconomic changes largely suppressed vegetation productivity. In the post-TP period, only 7.0% of the vegetated lands experienced an increasing trend in NDVIres while NDVIres decline accounted for 20.1% of the vegetated areas (p < 0.05), mainly distributed in northern Kazakhstan and large areas in the Amu Darya and Syr Darya Basins. Positive transitions resulted from the changes in crop types, decreases in grazing pressure, and increases in water resources, whereas negative transitions were coincident with areas that saw land abandonment, water resource shortages, and soil salinization due to former intensive cultivation. These findings highlight the spatiotemporal changes of institutional and socioeconomic impacts on vegetation productivity in Central Asian dryland and provide implications for future dtyland management and restoration efforts.

However, quantitative impacts of soil and water conservation (SWC) measures on conservation practice factor (P) of the RUSLE remain largely unclear, especially for the mountainous and hilly areas. In this study, we improved the RUSLE by considering quantitative impacts of different SWC measures on the P factor value. The improved RUSLE was validated against the long-term (2000-2015) soil erosion monitoring data obtained from 96 runoff plots (15-35 degrees) in mountainous and hilly areas of Hubei Province, China; the result presented a high accuracy with the determination coefficient of 0.89. Based on the erosion monitoring data of 2018 and 2019, the Root Mean Square Error of the result by the improved RUSLE was 28.0% smaller than that by the original RUSLE with decrement of 19.6%-24.0% in the average P factor values, indicating that the soil erosion modelling accuracy was significantly enhanced by the improved RUSLE. Relatively low P factor values appeared for farmlands with tillage measures (P < 0.53), grasslands with engineering measures (P < 0.23), woodlands with biological measures (P < 0.28), and other land use types with biological measures (P < 0.51). The soil erosion modulus showed a downward trend with the corresponding values of 1681.21, 1673.14, 1594.70, 1482.40 and 1437.50 t km(-2) a(-1) in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2019, respectively. The applicability of the improved RUSLE was verified by the measurements in typical mountainous and hilly areas of Hubei Province, China, and arrangements of SWC measures of this area were proposed.

J	Orr, A; Weltzien, E; Rattunde, F				Orr, Alastair; Weltzien, Eva; Rattunde, Fred			Research and development for sorghum and millets in Sub-Saharan Africa: What have we learned?	OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE												The past two decades of R & D for sorghum and millets in SSA have generated a wealth of new evidence. A synthesis of this evidence identified six strategic lessons. These were that demand is not being driven by 'new uses', that plant breeding programmes need to respond to African farmer's contexts and objectives to increase impact, that availability is a bigger constraint on the supply of certified seed than physical or economic access, that higher adoption of improved varieties does not generally result in higher yields, that technology and varietal diversity can compensate for climate change, and that commercialisation can be gender - and socially inclusive. R & D in Africa differs from the Indian model because of the low level of commercialisation and the continued dominance of own consumption. Consequently R & D gives a dominant role to the public sector in plant breeding, to farmer organisations and groups in seed supply, and to prioritising household food security over commercial uses.

In this study, we coupled the independent automatic parameter optimization tool PEST (Parameter ESTimation) with the crop growth model of DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) using the R programming language. A new DSSAT-PEST package was developed to perform automatic optimization of the crop genetic parameters. In addition, the PEST tool was modified to reduce problems associated with local optima and model runtime. The DSSAT-PEST package was used to estimate the genetic coefficients for five crops (i.e., maize (Zea mays L.), soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)) based on existing experiments in the DSSAT database. Three parameter optimization methods were compared based on their efficiency and accuracy for estimating crop genetic parameters: 1) the traditional trial-and-error method (default crop genetic parameters in the DSSAT database); 2) DSSAT-GLUE (general likelihood uncertainty estimation, an existing parameter estimation package in DSSAT), and 3) DSSAT-PEST. The DSSAT-PEST optimization method produced reasonably accurate optimization results and improved optimization efficiency compared with the other two methods. For example, the average absolute relative error (AREs) between relevant field observations and model simulations obtained with DSSAT-PEST were 12 %, 7 %, 18 %, 4 %, and 19 % for the five crops, respectively, which were similar to or better than the results with DSSAT-GLUE and the default method. Additionally, average runtime for DSSAT-PEST was about 65 % of the runtime for DSSAT-GLUE. In general, the DSSAT-PEST package performed similarly to or better than the traditional trial-and-error method and DSSAT-GLUE in terms of both optimization efficiency and accuracy, which should promote wider application of the DSSAT model in agricultural and environmental research.

S.; Sharma, Mamta			Temperature and Soil Moisture Stress Modulate the Host Defense Response in Chickpea During Dry Root Rot Incidence	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Dry root rot caused by the necrotrophic phytopathogenic fungus Rhizoctonia bataticola is an emerging threat to chickpea production in India. In the near future, the expected increase in average temperature and inconsistent rainfall patterns resultant of changing climatic scenarios are strongly believed to exacerbate the disease to epidemic proportions. The present study aims to quantify the collective role of temperature and soil moisture content (SMC) on disease progression in chickpea under controlled environmental conditions. In our study, we could find that both temperature and soil moisture played a decisive role in influencing the dry root rot disease scenario. As per the disease susceptibility index (DSI), a combination of high temperature (35 degrees C) and low SMC (60%) was found to elicit the highest disease susceptibility in chickpea. High pathogen colonization was realized in chickpea root tissue at all time-points irrespective of genotype, temperature, and SMC. Interestingly, this was in contrast to the DSI where no visible symptoms were recorded in the roots or foliage during the initial time-points. For each time-point, the colonization was slightly higher at 35 degrees C than 25 degrees C, while the same did not vary significantly with respect to SMC. Furthermore, the differential expression study revealed the involvement of host defense-related genes like endochitinase and PR-3-type chitinase (CHI III) genes in delaying the dry root rot (DRR) disease progression in chickpea. Such genes were found to be highly active during the early stages of infection especially under low SMC.

However, large uncertainties remain regarding the controlling factors that regulate GEP and ET in semiarid grasslands, especially during periods of vegetation re-establishment and succession. Using the eddy-covariance technique, we assessed the interannual variability and key biophysical controls of carbon (C) and water vapor (H2O) fluxes in a semiarid grassland ecosystem in northern China from 2012 to 2020. After years of being subjected to heavy grazing and with a recent ban, the shrub-to-herb ratio at the site increased from 0.5 in 2014 to 0.63 in 2020. Associated with decreasing soil water availability (similar to 4.0% year(-1)), canopy transpiration and light use efficiency also decreased at rates of about 3.3% and 6.2% year(-1), respectively. Multi-year means of GEP and ET were 166.6 +/- 20.1 g C m(-2) (mean +/- SD) and 190.2 +/- 21.8 mm, respectively. Interannual variability in GEP was mostly driven by variation in summer GEP, which for the most part was limited by mid-summer air temperature (T-a), particularly when exceeding the plants' optimal temperature for photosynthesis. Interannual variability in ET was predominantly caused by variation in spring ET, which was mostly affected by spring vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and associated reductions in canopy stomatal conductance. Synchronous changes in GEP and ET resulted in a relatively stable annual water use efficiency (WUE) of 0.97 +/- 0.13 g C kg(-1) H2O. This stability is indicative of the shrubs' capabilities to acclimate to arid conditions. Our results suggest that temperature and atmospheric aridity have important roles in regulating C gains and H2O losses in recovering dryland vegetation, respectively. Future increases in climatic variability anticipated with global climate change may augment the regional transition from grass to shrub cover.																			0168-1923	1873-2240				OCT 15	2023	341								109672	10.1016/j.agrformet.2023.109672	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2023.109672													WOS:001091305100001

The Three-North region (TNR) in China experiences diverse climate conditions, from arid to humid zones. In this region, substantial LCC has occurred over the past decades due to ecological restoration programs and urban expansion. At a regional scale, the hydrological effects of LCC have been demonstrated to be less observable than the effects of climate change, but it is unclear whether or not the effects of LCC may be intensified by future climate conditions. In this study, we employed remote sensing datasets and a macro-scale hydrological modeling to identify the dependence of the future hydrological regime of the TNR on past LCC. The hydrological effects over the period from 2020-2099 were evaluated based on a Representative Concentration Pathway climate scenario. The results indicated that the forest area increased in the northwest (11,691 km(2)) and the north (69 km(2)) of China but declined in the northeast (30,042 km(2)) over the past three decades. Moreover, the urban area has expanded by 1.3% in the TNR. Under the future climate condition, the hydrological regime will be influenced significantly by LCC. Those changes from 1986 to 2015 may alter the future hydrological cycle mainly by promoting runoff (3.24 mm/year) and decreasing evapotranspiration (3.23 mm/year) over the whole region. The spatial distribution of the effects may be extremely uneven: the effects in humid areas would be stronger than those in other areas. Besides, with rising temperatures and precipitation from 2020 to 2099, the LCC may heighten the risk of dryland expansion and flooding more than climate change alone. Despite uncertainties in the datasets and methods, the regional-scale hydrological model provides new insights into the extended impacts of ecological restoration and urbanization on the hydrological regime of the TNR.

To understand how soil organic carbon (OC) and nutrients will respond to re-vegetation practices in such an ecotone zone, we present the response of OC, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in both bulk soils and water-stable aggregates to typical re-vegetation patterns in an agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China. Three re-vegetation patterns, i.e., cropland converted to natural grassland, woodland and artificial grassland at different times (6 to 40 years), were selected. The paired croplands were also selected as the control for each re-vegetation pattern. The measured soil metrics include the proportions of each type of water-stable aggregate, the mean weight diameter and geometric mean diameter of the aggregates, and the concentrations of OC, N and P in bulk soils and each aggregate fraction. The results showed that the three re-vegetation patterns significantly increased the mass proportion of macro-aggregates, the values of mean weight diameter and geometric mean diameter, and the concentrations of OC and N in topsoils (0-10 cm). The accumulation of OC and N in bulk soils was mainly due to the accumulation in macro-aggregates. Furthermore, increases in OC and N were greater after conversion to legume vegetation than to non-legume vegetation, and were highest at approximately 20 years after the conversion. However, concentrations of P in bulk soils and aggregates were similar among the three re-vegetation patterns and the three aggregate fractions, and were minimally affected by the conversion. These results highlighted the potential of legume vegetation to increase OC and N in surface soils and aggregates, and indicated no response of soil P to re-vegetation in an agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China.

This study focused on five local varieties of carrots from irrigated regions of southern Tunisia (Sidi Sallem, Sagui, Arram, ElGrine and Boughrara) with different root pigmentation. The carrots were evaluated for their morphological, physicochemical, biochemical, and organoleptic charac-teristics. Morphological characterization showed significant differences (p<0.01) in length, weight, and diameter of the root part and aerial part among the five landraces. The pH, titratable acidity, and Brix values were also different for each landrace, ranging from 6.18 (Sagui) to 6.27 (Arram), 0.016 (Boughrara) to 0.045 mg.g -1 citric acid (Arram), and 5.60 (Arram) to 7.80% (Sidi Sallem), respectively. The study also identified 10 phenolic acids through LC-ESI/MS analysis, with quinic acid, protocachuic acid, and chlorogenic acid being the most abundant compounds. The HPLC method was used to analyze the sugar and & beta;-carotene contents of the landraces. Results showed that the Sidi Sallem landrace had the highest fructose (625 mg.kg- 1 DM), glucose (1000 mg.kg- 1 DM), and & beta;-carotene (2551.808 mg. kg- 1 DM) contents. Sagui had the highest levels of & alpha;-tocopherol (vitamin E) (236 & mu;g. L -1) and vitamin K2 (6.5 & mu;g. L -1). Sensory analysis of the juices and pureed salads prepared from the five carrot landraces confirmed the findings of the morphological and nutritional evaluations. This research suggests that a participatory breeding program should be considered to preserve genetic resources and improve them in terms of nutritional quality criteria. The work highlights the nutritional value of carrot as a source of natural antioxidant compounds, which may be beneficial in the food and pharmaceutical industries.

The RNA-Seq has generated >450 million high-quality reads (HQRs) and nearly 96.97% were properly aligned to the reference genome. Very high similarity in FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped fragments) values (R > 0.9) among biological replicates showed the consistency of the RNA-Seq results. The study revealed various DEGs (differentially expressed genes) that were associated with changes in phenolic compounds, transcription factors (TFs), antioxidants, receptor kinases, hormone signals which corresponded to the cell wall modification enzymes, defense-related metabolites, and jasmonic acid (JA)/ethylene (ET) pathways. Gene ontology (GO) categorization also showed similar kinds of significantly enriched similar GO terms. Interestingly, of the total unigenes (42,606), 12,648 got assembled and showed significant hit with Rhizoctonia species. String analysis also revealed the role of various disease responsive proteins viz., LRR family proteins, LRR-RLKs, protein kinases, etc. in the host-pathogen interaction. Insilico validation analysis was performed using Genevestigator(R) and DEGs belonging to six major defense-response groups viz., defense-related enzymes, disease responsive genes, hormones, kinases, PR (pathogenesis related) proteins, and TFs were validated. For the first time some key miRNA targets viz. miR156, miR159, miR167, miR169, and miR482 were identified from the studied transcriptome, which may have some vital role in Rhizoctonia-based responses in lentils. The study has revealed the molecular mechanisms of the lentil/R. bataticola interactions and also provided a theoretical approach for the development of lentil genotypes resistant to R. bataticola.

PLANTS-BASEL												A total of 14 Rhizobium strains were isolated from lentil accessions grown at the ICARDA experimental research station at Marchouch in Morocco and used for molecular characterization and symbiotic efficiency assessment. Individual phylogenetic analysis using the 16S rRNA gene, house-keeping genes rpoB, recA, and gyrB, and symbiotic genes nodD and nodA along with Multilocus Sequence Analysis (MLSA) of the concatenated genes (16S rRNA-rpoB-recA-gyrB) was carried out for the identification and clustering of the isolates. The symbiotic efficiency of the strains was assessed on three Moroccan lentil cultivars (Bakria, Chakkouf, and Zaria) based on the number of nodules, plant height, plant dry weight, and total nitrogen content in leaves. The results showed that the individual phylogenetic analysis clustered all the strains into Rhizobium laguerreae and Rhizobium leguminosarum with sequence similarity ranging from 94 to 100%, except one strain which clustered with Mesorhizobium huakuii with sequence similarity of 100%. The MLSA of the concatenated genes and the related percentages of similarity clustered these strains into two groups of Rhizobium species, with one strain as a new genospecies when applying the threshold of 96%. For symbiotic efficiency, the Bakria variety showed the best association with 10 strains compared to its non-inoculated control (p-value <= 0.05), followed by Chakkouf and Zaria. The present study concluded that the genetic diversity and the symbiotic efficiency of Rhizobium strains appeared to be mainly under the control of the lentil genotypes.					sijilmassi, Badreddine/AAZ-4894-2020; Kumar, Shiv/AAV-9958-2020; Udupa, Sripada M./E-8297-2011; Filali-Maltouf, Abdelkarim/AAD-3681-2022	sijilmassi, Badreddine/0000-0002-7642-8201; Kumar, Shiv/0000-0001-8407-3562; Filali-Maltouf, Abdelkarim/0000-0002-2727-3389; KRICHA, AYMANE/0000-0001-6713-7077; BOULAHYAOUI, Hassan/0000-0001-5668-397X														2223-7747				JAN	2021	10	1							15	10.3390/plants10010015	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants10010015								33374129					WOS:000610714600001

Optimizing tillage practices is an important measure to save energy, protect the environment and increase productivity. Based on this concept, a field experiment of two years duration (2019-2021) was performed to assess the impacts of various tillage techniques on grain yield, energy balance, carbon footprint (CF), and economic benefits of a winter wheat-summer maize rotation system in the Loess Plateau of China. The treatments included conventional tillage (CT), no-tillage (NT), ridge cultivation with no-tillage (RNT), and occasional tillage (OT). This study is the first to evaluates the economic and environmental benefits of OT and RNT in dry farming. The total annual average greenhouse gas emissions calculated through the life cycle assessment are 2869.2-3407.6 kg CO2eqmiddotha-1, and the energy consumption and output are 28.2-37.7 GJ ha-1 and 575.2-659.0 GJ ha-1, respectively. The net ecosystem economic benefit is 26,206.6-34,787.4 CNY ha-1. Compared with CT, annual crop yields of RNT, OT and NT have increased by 13.5%,15.4% and 4.0%, respectively, energy utilization efficiency has increased by 47.8%, 31.2% and 35.3%,and carbon footprint has been reduced by 79.3%, 46.2% and 73.2%, economic efficiency has increased by 32.7%, 29.8% and 19.6%, respectively. Despite reducing energy consumption and carbon footprint, NT has no significant impact on annual crop yields. Optimizing tillage practices (RNT and OT) can achieve higher economic and environmental benefits. The Z-score shows that RNT in dryland agroecosystems can be used as a promising tillage practice to boost crop productivity, energy efficiency and economic efficiency, reduce CF, and achieve sustain -ability. RNT can be selected as the recommended agricultural management measure suitable for areas with similar cli-matic patterns in the Loess Plateau.

Supporting Beneficial Insects for Agricultural Sustainability: The Role of Livestock-Integrated Organic and Cover Cropping to Enhance Ground Beetle (Carabidae) Communities	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Ground beetles (Carabidae) are beneficial insects providing ecosystem services by regulating insect pests and weed seeds. Despite several studies conducted on ground beetles worldwide, there is a lack of knowledge on how these insects are affected by differently managed organic systems (e.g., tillage-based versus grazed-based) compared to that of chemical-based no-tillage conventional cropping systems. In a 5-year (2013-2017) study, we assessed the ground beetle communities in cover crops and winter wheat (Triticum aestiviumL.) in Montana, USA, with three contrasting cropping systems: a chemically managed no-tillage, a tillage-based organic, and a livestock-integrated organic with reduced tillage. The first three years (i.e., 2013-2015) corresponded to the transition to organic period, while the last two (i.e., 2016-2017) were conducted in United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) organic-certified tillage-based and livestock-integrated organic systems. The experiment was designed with three management systems across three blocks as the whole plot variable and 5-year rotation of crop phases as the subplot variable. Using pitfall traps, we sampled ground beetles across all cover crop and winter wheat subplots for five years (n= 450). The data were analyzed using mixed effects models and PERMANOVA and visualized with non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination. Our study indicated that organically managed farms, whether tilled or grazed, enhance activity density, species richness, diversity, and evenness of ground beetles in the dryland row crop productions. Also, irrespective of farming system, cover crops supported higher species richness, diversity, and evenness of ground beetles than winter wheat. The ground beetle communities were mostly similar during the transition to organic period. However, during the established organic phase, cropping systems acted as contrasting ecological filters and beetle communities became dissimilar. Cover cropping affected ground beetle communities positively not only in organically managed systems but also in chemical-based conventional systems. Our study provides evidence supporting the adoption of ecologically-based cropping systems such as crop-livestock integration, organic farming, and cover cropping to enhance beneficial insects and their pest-regulation services.

J	Mallawaarachchi, T; Auricht, C; Loch, A; Adamson, D; Quiggin, J				Mallawaarachchi, Thilak; Auricht, Christopher; Loch, Adam; Adamson, David; Quiggin, John			Water allocation in Australia's Murray-Darling Basin: Managing change under heightened uncertainty	ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND POLICY												Historically, water resource policy in the Murray-Darling Basin (Basin) has taken a pro-farmer orientation leaving the environment to become the residual claimant. Around 1990, the attention was focused on minimising overuse that led to on-farm productivity losses and developing a market for water to help define opportunity costs of water in irrigation. More recently, the scope has been extended to include explicit allocations for the environment. However, the failure to agree on policies for recovering water for the environment in the implementation of the Basin Plan has extended avenues for rent seeking and cost shifting, thereby raising the total costs of reform. A focus on water use per se, rather than system productivity, and sidelining of market-based approaches in preference for government investment in water recovery and water use efficiency has complicated risk assignment amongst different users. Recurring droughts and resultant scarcity of water has made negotiations further complicated and controversial, broadening the gulf between environmentalists seeking public good outcomes and irrigators seeking private profit. Despite these, the MDB system as a whole, including dryland and irrigated farming, environmental uses and other industries, has adjusted to chanding conditions, drawing on new knowledge and technology and emerging market opportunities. Irrigators have shown an ability to diversify into new commodities with better prospects for managing risks. However, declining farm numbers, a changing demography and accelerating climate change point to general failure risks if the reform process were to halt and governments disregarded the gains through a rebalancing of consumption possibilities from the full complement of Basin's resources - not just irrigation. This paper, examines the sources of social costs in water resource allocation, including pros and cons of water trading with respect to agricultural production and externalities. The aim is to canvass possible reform alternatives which might help governments to become a catalyst in fostering collaboration for efficient adaptation.

However, how soil carbon dynamics respond to different straw retention practices remains unclear. In this study, we investigated soil respiration and soil carbon sequestration at depths of 0-100 cm. We conducted a two-year field experiment with three crop rotation treatments and three straw retention treatments in northwest China. The straw retention treatments included no straw retention (NS), retention of half the straw (HS), and retention of the total amount of straw (TS). The crop rotations treatments included winter wheat plus summer soybean (WS), winter wheat plus summer maize (WM), and winter wheat plus summer fallow (WF). Mean soil respiration rates under WS, WM, and WF treatments were 5.14, 6.53, and 5.49 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1); and 5.67, 5.47, and 6.03 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) under TS, HS, and NS treatments. The mean soil water content were 15.50%, 15.57%, and 15.74% under WS, WM, and WF rotations, and 15.81%, 15.41%, and 15.50% under TS, HS, and NS treatments. The soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration was higher with increased straw retention, and lower at deeper soil depths. Mean SOC concentrations under different rotations and straw treatments of TS, HS, and NS, respectively were as follows: WS: 6.91, 6.63, 6.39 g/kg; WM: 6.90, 6.72, 6.57 g/kg; and WF: 6.49, 6.52, 6.37 g/kg. Soil temperature was the main determinant of soil respiration rates. We conclude that WS rotation resulted in lower soil respiration, WM rotation resulted in a higher soil carbon sequestration potential, and WF rotation resulted in higher soil water content. However, continued, long-term monitoring is needed to confirm the effect of rotations and straw retention on soil respiration and carbon sequestration in dryland cropping systems in northern China.					德杰, 孔/GRR-8605-2022	德杰, 孔/0000-0001-5749-5890													1932-6203					SEP 23	2019	14	9							e0219253	10.1371/journal.pone.0219253	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219253								31545801					WOS:000532303200009

Z.; Rolando, Jose L.; Kalu, Subin; Biasi, Christina; Karhu, Kristiina			Priming effect depending on land use and soil types in a typical semi-arid landscape in Kenya	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Addition of labile carbon (C) inputs to soil can accelerate or slow down the decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM), a phenomenon known as priming effect (PE). However, the magnitude and direction of PE is often difficult to predict, consequently making its relationship with labile C inputs and nutrient availability elusive. To assess this relationship, we added C-13 labelled glucose (corresponding to 50% of initial soil microbial biomass C) to two soil types (Vertisol and Acrisol) with different concentrations of available N and from four land use systems (agricultural, pasture, grassland and shrubland). Parallel laboratory incubations i.e. short-term (6 days) and long-term (6 months), were set up to determine the effect of land use and soil type (N availability) on PE. Addition of labelled glucose in solution led to the retardation of SOM mineralization (negative PE) in both soil types and across all land use systems. This is attributed to preferential substrate utilization characterized by the higher mineralization of added glucose. Land use systems and soil types with higher N-availability displayed weaker negative PE, which is in line with the stoichiometric decomposition theory. In conclusion, our study demonstrate that N-availability plays a major role in determining mineralization of labile C inputs, magnitude and direction of PE in the studied dryland soils and land use systems. The fact that 15-27% of the added C-13 remained in the soil at the end of the 6 months incubation and PE was negative, indicates that continuous labile C inputs could contribute to C immobilization and stabilization in these semiarid soils. Moreover, C-13 glucose remaining in soils after 6 months in semi-natural pastures was comparable to those under natural grassland and shrubland systems especially in Acrisols. This demonstrates that incorporation and maintaining a perennial cover of native pastures has the potential to increase C sequestration in African semi-arid agricultural soils and landscapes.					; Biasi, Christina/E-1130-2013	Kalu, Subin/0000-0003-4221-3701; Biasi, Christina/0000-0002-7413-3354; Mganga, Kevin/0000-0002-7908-7561; Rolando, Jose/0000-0002-4138-2100													0168-2563	1573-515X				MAR	2023	163	1					49	63		10.1007/s10533-023-01016-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-023-01016-z		JAN 2023											WOS:000919953500002

Conventional straw mulching has low productivity in areas with relatively low temperatures. Meanwhile, the responses of soil respiration to mulching practices and the relationship between changes in environmental factors caused by mulching and carbon (C) components are not clear in dryland agroecosystem. In this study, we monitored seasonal changes in soil respiration flux and heterotrophic respiration flux of winter wheat fields under different mulching practices in a semiarid rainfed agroecosystem of northern China. The fields were designed for the following three treatments: straw strip mulching (SSM), plastic film mulching (PFM), and non-mulching (CK). Compared to CK, SSM decreased cumulative soil respiration and heterotrophic respiration by 11.6% and 13.3%, whereas PFM increased these values by 12.8% and 8.5%, respectively. SSM significantly decreased soil temperature but increased soil water-filled pore space (WFPS), while PFM significantly increased soil WFPS without affecting soil temperature. Respiration flux was more highly correlated with soil temperature and air temperature than with WFPS and rainfall. SSM and PFM respectively increased by 5.7-9.1% and 10.8-35.5% for grain yield, by 8.1-45.6% and 16.2-69.5% for straw yield, by 8.6-28.6% and 15.1-36.4% for net primary production, and by 23.1-80.6% and 20.3-95.2% for net ecosystem production. Furthermore, mulching practices had a great potential of soil C sequestration and SSM significantly increased soil organic carbon. Changes in ecosystem C components were primarily driven by biomass, followed by soil temperature and air temperature rather than WFPS and rainfall. Based on the sustainability of agroecosystems, SSM increased grain yield of winter wheat while reduced carbon emissions, which showed great potential for C sequestration and may create an environmentally friendly C sink system in a semiarid rainfed agroecosystem of northern China.																			0167-8809	1873-2305				AUG 15	2022	334								107990	10.1016/j.agee.2022.107990	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2022.107990		APR 2022											WOS:000795766100002

Use of Plant Growth Regulators to Expand Sagebrush Germination Rates for Restoration Efforts	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Seed germination during unhospitable environmental conditions can be a major barrier to direct seeding efforts in dryland systems. In the sagebrush steppe, Wyoming big sagebrush and low sagebrush are important shrub species used in restoration; however, seeding success is highly sporadic due to interannual and intraseasonal weather variability. It may be possible to improve restoration success by expanding the period of seed germination to increase the chances some seeds will germinate within a window that is favorable for plant establishment. Our objective was to determine if we could expand the period of germination using plant growth regulators (PGRs) applied in a conglomerated seed coating to Wyoming big sagebrush and low sagebrush. The seed of each species was 1) left untreated; 2) conglomerated; 3) conglomerated and treated with two concentrations of a germination inhibitor, abscisic acid (ABA); or 4) conglomerated and treated with two different germination promoters, gibberellic acid (GA(3)) and 1-aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid (ACC) (6 treatments total). Seeds were incubated in a loam soil at five constant temperatures (5-25 degrees C) for approximately 3 mo. Results indicate that seed treatments with PGRs can delay or accelerate germination. For example, at 5 degrees C, which is the temperature most similar to when the seeds germinate in the field, ABA delayed the time for 50% of the seeds to germinate by a maximum of 28 d and 38 d and the germination promoters decreased this time by 9 d and 11 d for Wyoming big sagebrush and low sagebrush, respectively. Field studies are now needed to determine if the bet-hedging strategy developed in this study will increase the likelihood of seeding success. Although our study focused on sagebrush, there is merit to evaluate the use of PGRs on other species, particularly where seed is being sown in highly variable environments.

However, their long-term effects on soil physicochemical properties, extracellular enzyme activities, microbial community structure, and therefore soil quality via developing a soil quality index (SQI) remain largely unexplored. Hence, we analyzed soils after 14 years of mulching (CT, no mulch; RF, plastic film-mulched ridges and straw mulched-furrows; SM, straw mulching) and N fertilization (0, 120 and 240 kg ha(-1)) treatments in a maize-wheat rotation on China's Loess Plateau. Compared with CT, RF and SM significantly increased soil moisture content (SMC), organic carbon (SOC), phosphatase, and total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). Compared with RF, SM increased SOC, total N, available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK), beta-glucosidase, N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG), peroxidase, and cellobiohydrolase, gram-negative bacteria (G(-)), and fungi. Consequently, the SQI was highest in SM (0.698), followed by RF (0.642) and CT (0.620). Nitrogen fertilization significantly increased total N, NO3-, microbial biomass N, alpha-glucosidase, NAG, total PLFAs, and G(-), but caused a significant decline in pH, AP, AK, and the G(+):G(-) ratio. Averaged across N-fertilizations, the SQI was ranked N240 (0.680) > N120 (0.650) > N0 (0.630). Redundancy analysis showed that SOC was closely associated with enzyme activities, whereas NO3-, SOC, and SMC were the key variables regulating microbial community composition. Structural equation model indicated that mulching and N fertilization strongly and positively affected SQI by regulating soil available N, P, and K, enzyme activities, and microbial communities, and the total effect of mulching (0.62) on SQI was greater than that of N addition (0.34). Collectively, the highest SQI observed in the SM + N240 treatment suggested that straw mulch, rather than plastic-film mulch, combined with high N addition could be a sustainable land management practice that improves soil quality in semiarid dryland farming systems.

In the Atlantic and Mediterranean biogeographic regions, coastal dunes are priority conservation areas highly sensitive to aridification where plants and biological soil crusts may play a key role maintaining ecosystem services. However, we still need further insights into the balance between the effects of increasing aridity and the influence of local vegetation on the soil attributes and functioning of these systems, particularly in transitional areas between humid and arid climatic zones. We sampled 24 dune systems distributed along a natural climate gradient including humid, dry-subhumid and arid environments in the Atlantic coastline of the Iberian Peninsula and investigated (i) how aridity drives the vegetation community structure, soil biotic and abiotic properties and functions in dune ecosystems at a regional scale; and (ii) to what extent soil attributes differ locally under diverse surface microsites (i.e. plants, biocrust and bare soil). Increasing aridity in coastal dunes decreased total biotic cover and favoured the formation of shrub-dominated patches. Vegetation shifts were accompanied by declines in soil microbial diversity, organic matter, nutrient contents and reduced rates of N mineralization. Soil bacterial communities were more sensitive to aridity than fungal communities. Microsites were essential regulators of soil attributes, and their effects were dependent on the degree of aridity. In drylands, shrub microsites were associated to higher soil organic C, microbial (bacterial and fungal) abundance, fungal diversity and potential heterotrophic respiration than bare microsites, likely due to enhanced litter and sediment redistribution. However, at humid and transition systems, microsites controlled soil N pools and microbial diversity, suggesting tight linkages between vegetation patches and soil microorganisms responsible for N availability. These findings provide evidence of the strong negative impacts of aridification on vegetation attributes and nutrient cycling in coastal dunes and highlight the role of the biotic cover in preserving soil fertility, microbial diversity and functioning, particularly in the most arid sites.

Sulfur and nitrogen responses by barley and wheat on a sandy soil in a semi-arid environment	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE												Soil testing guidelines for sulfur (S) under dryland cropping in south-eastern Australia are not well developed. Our objective was to assess the value of soil and tissue tests for S and nitrogen (N), because the two minerals frequently interact), in predicting S-deficient sites and hence increasing the probability of response to application of S (and N). Here, we report three proximal experiments in 2014-16 for barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) on a sandy soil in a semi-arid environment near Merriwagga in western New South Wales. The trials contained a factorial combination of four rates of each of applied N as urea and S as high-grade gypsum. Responses to S were obtained for dry matter (DM) quantity and nutrient content at flowering in 2014, but no grain-yield response was obtained in any year. DM response to applied S was obtained when the concentration of S in the DM was increased from 0.08% in barley and 0.09% in wheat without S application to 0.10-0.11% in both crops with S applied as gypsum. Because we obtained no grain-yield responses to applied S, the 0.10% S in grain was likely to have been adequate for both crops in these experiments. A pool of subsoil S was accessed during each season and this compensated for any DM deficiencies of S by the time of grainfill. Shallow soil tests (0-10 cm) for S can therefore indicate sufficiency but not necessarily deficiency; therefore, in grain-cropping areas, we recommend soil S tests on the same samples as used for deep N testing (to 60 cm) and that an S-budgeting approach be used following the soil tests. Furthermore, for marginal nutritional circumstances such as occurred in this study, the supporting use of N : S ratio is recommended, with values >17 in DM or grain likely to indicate S deficiency for both barley and wheat.

J	Helman, D; Mussery, A				Helman, David; Mussery, Amir			Using Landsat satellites to assess the impact of check dams built across erosive gullies on vegetation rehabilitation	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Gully erosion, a process of soil removal due to water accumulation and runoff, is a worldwide problem affecting agricultural lands. Building check dams perpendicular to the flow direction is one of the suggested control practices to stabilize this process. Though there are many studies on the effect of erosive controls on land stabilization, few examine its effect on the rehabilitation of vegetation. Here we use information from the satellites Landsat-7 (1999-2018) and Landsat-8 (2013-2018) to assess the effect of soil check dams built during 2012 across three gullies with distinct structures in a dryland area on vegetative cover andwater status. We use a time series analysis technique to decompose Landsat-derived soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) intowoody (SAVIW) and herbaceous (iSAVIH) contributions. The integral over the seasonal signal of the normalized difference water index (iNDWI) was used to assess changes in water status in the gully. We used herbaceous biomass collected in the field in 2014-2017 to validate iSAVIH as a proxy of herbaceous biomass. Our results show that following the construction of the check dams, the change inwoody vegetation cover is best described by a sigmoid model with an increase of similar to 57% (95% CI: 39%-76%; p < 0.0001), while the herbaceous vegetation increases linearly at a rate of similar to 71% per year (95% CI: 48%-93% y(-1); p < 0.0001). The correlation between iSAVIH and herbaceous biomass (R-2= 0.56; n= 16; p < 0.001) corroborates this increase. We found higher herbaceous productivity in the deeper gully compared to the shallower gullies but not statistically different increase rates. An increase in iNDWI of similar to 68% (95% CI: 43%-95%; p < 0.0001) likely implies an improved water infiltration rate that favored the vegetation expansion. Our satellite-based approach can be used to assess the impact of erosive control practices on vegetation rehabilitation in heterogeneous gullies. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Determinants of contract farming in barley production - Regression tree approach	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES												Barley, a nutri-rich cereal is gaining momentum among stakeholders owing to multiple health benefits but the concern is its declining area, possibly attributed to lack of market and competitive pricing strategy. Amongst alternatives, contract farming is widely suggested for better price realisation and assured market. In the context, the present study was carried out during 2013-15 in four major barley growing states in India, viz. Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh for identifying the determinants of contract farming from a sample of 400 randomly selected farmers using regression tree approach. Findings indicated that the average yield of farmers enrolled in contract farming was 4791 kg/ha (n=90) against non-contractors with an estimated yield of 3549 kg/ha (n=310), implying a yield advantage of 35%. The practice of enrollment into contracts was popular in Rajasthan as corroborated by regression tree. The analysis also indicated that farm size, seed replacement behaviour, source of seed and area under barley were turned as deciding factors in contract enrollment. Overall, the study indicated that region plays a prominent role in enrollment into contracts despite multiple benefits availed. The study advocates barley growers to take advantage of contract farming, especially small-holders to enroll into contracts for mitigating price risk apart from self-empowerment in barley production.

The objective of this experiment was to explore the effects of the synthetic auxin naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) on the physiological processes of foxtail millet, and to provide a theoretical basis and technical approaches for its efficient use in millet cultivation. Two foxtail millet varieties ('Jingu 21' and 'Zhangzagu 5') were treated with six concentrations of NAA from 0-144 mg L-1 at the grain-filling stage in field experiments. The photosynthetic pigment contents, gas exchange parameters, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, and grain yield were measured in foxtail millet. The results showed that low concentrations of NAA (18-36 mg L-1) increased the contents of photosynthetic pigments, and increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes, the photosynthetic rate, and the activity of photosystem system II (PS II). At higher NAA concentrations, the facilitation effect of the treatments diminished, showing a clear concentration effect. In this study, yield was significantly and positively correlated with PS II effective quantum yield (Y(II)) and the PSII electron transport rate (ETR), and the net photosynthetic rate (Pn) was significantly and positively correlated with chlorophyll content, stomatal conductance (Gs), Y(II), and ETR. These results also indicated that exogenous NAA application promotes the production of ATP and NADPH by increasing the efficiency of electron transfer within the photosystems and also improved photochemical utilization, which facilitates the fixation and reduction of carbon, ultimately leading to an increase in Pn and increasing grain yield in foxtail millet.					chen, Chen/JKJ-2122-2023; chen, chen/JGD-3057-2023; cheng, chen/JHS-9462-2023; Wang, Yuchen/JPW-9345-2023; zhang, luyu/JJC-4227-2023; Wang, Yiping/IZQ-2052-2023; FENG, ZHIWEI/L-5072-2014; zhang, xue/JJE-9257-2023; Lu, Lu/JPE-5187-2023; Chen, Chao/JHS-6563-2023; Zhang, Chi/JSK-0744-2023; zhou, yang/JED-3951-2023; wang, yingying/JSK-6741-2023; cheng, cheng/JBR-8359-2023; WANG, YANG/JFA-8821-2023; li, qing/JEF-9044-2023														1664-462X					JAN 4	2023	13								1019152	10.3389/fpls.2022.1019152	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.1019152								36684766					WOS:000913989100001

A two year field experiment was conducted at Tuzuo Banner modern agricultural Park in Inner Mongolia, China. Two phosphorus levels, including P0 (no fertilizer) and P45 (45 kg center dot ha(-1) P), were performed in common vetch and rape either grown alone or intercropped. We analyzed the changes of the physicochemical properties and phosphorus fractions in the rhizosphere soil. Intercropping enhanced the common vetch and rape yield by 42.05% and 24.91%, on average, compared with corresponding sole cropping on an equivalent area basis. The average land equivalent ratio (LER) was 1.34. Intercropping had a significant AP concentration, of 65.32% and 33.99% at the P0 level, and 62.83% and 36.19% at the P45 level, respectively, compared to that of the sole common vetch and rape. With the application of P, intercropping improved the Resin-Pi and NaHCO3-Pi fraction (61.17%, 87.03% at the P0 level and 96.50%, 41.85% at the P45 level, compared to monocropped common vetch and rape in 2019). The changes in NaOH-Pi and NaOH-Po (except for NaOH-Pi in 2019) showed no significant difference between cropping systems. Intercropping significantly accumulated concentrations of HCl-P, while depleting Residual-P, in 2020. In conclusion, common vetch/rape with the addition of P polyculture stimulated rhizosphere soil P mobilization and had a yield advantage over sole cropping.

The re-used mulching of plastic film (directly cropping on the already used plastic film) was tested compared to no-mulch and new mulching (mulching new film each year), in the grain maize, forage maize, and faba bean cropping systems. The new mulch significantly increased topsoil temperature (18.4% above average), upper 2 m soil moisture (20.2%), crop yield (85.8%), above-ground biomass (63.4%), net revenue (68.4%), proportion of macroaggregates (> 0.25 mm) (35.7%), mean weight diameter (MWD) (78.4%), soil organic carbon (7.0%), and heavy fraction organic carbon (10.3%) in all three crop systems compared to no-mulch. Re-used mulch significantly increased topsoil temperature (11.4% above average), moisture (13.4%), and MWD after final crop harvest (19.1%) in all three crop systems; and significantly increased crop yield (61.8%) and above-ground biomass (50.3%) in the faba bean system. However, re-used mulch had no significant effect for the grain and forage maize systems compared to no-mulch. The 2-years reused mulch (3-years continuously mulch) had significantly lower plastic film residue (57.1% below average) after final crop harvest in all three crop systems. Re-used mulch also produced significantly higher net revenue (13.2%) in the faba bean system compared to new mulch. In summary, cropping faba bean, under re-used mulch, instead of new mulch, significantly reduce the usage and residue of plastic film and resulted in similar high productivity, and may become a willingly adopted practice for farmers due to the higher net revenue. This work can serve as a reference for sustainable use of plastic film mulch and has potential applications to effectively reduce plastic film usage and residue in cropland and develop sustainable agriculture, especially for cultivating faba bean and other temperature-insensitive crops in developing countries.					zhang, xintan/IXD-8050-2023; Li, Feng-Min/K-8740-2012; Bajwa, Muhammad Naseer/AAK-5770-2020	zhang, xintan/0000-0002-2543-0256; Li, Feng-Min/0000-0002-2144-3498; Bajwa, Muhammad Naseer/0000-0002-4821-1056													0167-1987	1879-3444				FEB	2022	216								105256	10.1016/j.still.2021.105256	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2021.105256		NOV 2021											WOS:000720832700002
J	MacMillan, J; Shrestha, R; Adams, CB; Hinson, PO; Trostle, C				MacMillan, Jennifer; Shrestha, Rajan; Adams, Curtis B.; Hinson, Philip O.; Trostle, Calvin			The root system of guar: Spatial and temporal analysis of root and nodule development	ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY												Guar (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba [L.] Taub.) is a leguminous crop plant produced in semi-arid regions worldwide, primarily for industrial uses of guar gum. Little research has been conducted on critical belowground traits of the plant, particularly on spatial and temporal development of the root system, including nodules. Providing such analysis was the objective of this research. We observed root and nodule character traits at regular time intervals in 130-cm-tall soil columns sectioned by depth in 2 years. In this tap-rooted plant, root weight was greatest at the soil surface (0-15 cm) and decreased with depth. Root length density (RLD) from 0 to 15 cm and 15 to 30 cm soil depths was similar. The RLD and root weight were generally minimal in deeper soil layers, although deeper roots seem to play an important role in water uptake for guar, especially in drought conditions. Compared to most crops, guar has fine rooting and a small root-to-shoot ratio. At all soil depths analysed, >= 86% of root length was comprised of roots <1 mm in diameter, although most were very fine roots <0.5 mm. The root-to-shoot ratio ranged from 0.055 to 0.17 g g(-1) over the growing seasons. Significant accumulation of nodule weight occurred by 60 days, as did the first observations of nodule senescence, but nodule growth continued after this time. Most nodules and nodule weight were concentrated near the soil surface and the average weight per nodule decreased with depth, although smaller nodules were present at all depths. Because guar is typically grown in dryland conditions in hot semi-arid regions, nodules near the soil surface may often be susceptible to shedding or loss of function due to dehydration and/or heat stress and the plant may rely on deeper nodules for N fixation. The basic biological information provided in this report is needed to hasten progress in guar genetic improvement and management.

In this context, species selection strategies should enhance long-term functional resilience in the face of novel environmental scenarios. The use of plant functional traits for selecting species under climate change might be advantageous over more traditional taxon-based criteria as an adaptive forestry management strategy. In this work, we studied which functional traits (across species) have played a relevant role on field performance and fitness in a mull-species reforestation trial in a Mediterranean dryland affected by an extreme drought event. Different traits both from the individual plant and from the species were studied in seven species both at the short and the mid-term (10 years). The relative importance (RI) or contribution of the different traits to plantation performance was assessed through boosted regression tree models. The results showed that, under favorable climatic conditions, mean survival was above 70% and individual plant functional traits held up to 60% of importance on such value. The impact of species functional traits was low in this case (less than 18%) pointing out that all the species were performing within their niche at this point. However, after the driest year on record, the role of the latter on survival rose up to 53% of RI and survival sharply decreased to 33%, with some species showing negligible survival rate (< 10%). The dynamic response of stomata and xylem resistance to cavitation, together with roofing depth, were the main traits (species traits) identified in successful performance facing the extreme environmental factors.

J	Sacande, M; Muir, G				Sacande, Moctar; Muir, Giulia			Restoring Food Systems with Nutritious Native Plants: Experiences from the African Drylands	FOOD AND NUTRITION BULLETIN												Background: Twenty-seven African countries have committed to restore more than 100 million hectares of degraded land by 2030 as part of the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative (AFR100). In addition, for the same period of time, the African-led Great Green Wall initiative seeks to restore 100 million hectares of degraded agro-sylvo-pastoral lands in the Sahel. The current UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030) moreover marks an unprecedented opportunity to shape future landscapes, and forge more biodiverse and nutritious food systems. Yet most large-scale restoration actions continue to be largely isolated from socioeconomic challenges facing dryland communities, not least food security and acute malnutrition. Such isolations contribute to low restoration successes and outcomes in Africa's drylands. At the same time, international interventions aimed at improving acute malnutrition in the drylands have not adequately considered the agriculture-nutrition linkages, particularly "pre-farm gate"-including consumption pathways which optimize the use of native plant diversity.Objectives: This article identifies priority action areas emerging from experiences over 5 years of restoration activities carried out in the Sahel through Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) Action Against Desertification Programme supporting the implementation of Africa's Great Green Wall. These actions aim to inform development and humanitarian interventions on the ground to render restoration interventions nutrition-sensitive and hence more effective in practice.Results: Recognizing the symbiotic relationship between landscapes and livelihoods, FAO developed a blueprint for large-scale restoration that combines biophysical and socioeconomic aspects for the benefit of rural communities. The approach builds climate and nutritional resilience into its restoration interventions as a preventative approach to reverse land degradation and ultimately improve livelihoods, food security, and nutrition.Conclusions: FAO's experience demonstrated that what is planted and when has the potential to not only significantly improve biodiversity and reverse land degradation, but also positively influence nutrition outcomes. Future interventions in the drylands must involve joint efforts between nutritionists and natural resource managem prove both human and planetary health.

Recently, Iran's dryland fig orchards have been severely damaged due to prolonged severe and consecutive drought periods. As emphasized in many studies, ploidy manipulated plants have a significantly enhanced drought tolerance. In the current study, we compared the induced autotetraploid explants of two fig cultivars ('Sabz' and 'Torsh') with their diploid control plants for their water stress tolerance under in vitro conditions using different polyethylene glycol (PEG) concentrations (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25%). After 14 days of implementing water stress treatments, the results revealed that both tetraploid genotypes survived at 20% PEG treatments. Only 'Sabz' tetraploid explants survived at 25% PEG treatment, while both diploid control genotypes could tolerate water stress intensity only until 15% PEG treatment. The results also demonstrated that the tetraploid explants significantly had a higher growth rate, more leaf numbers, and greater fresh and dry weights than their diploid control plants. Under 15% PEG treatment, both tetraploid genotypes could maintain their relative water content (RWC) at a low-risk level (80-85%), while the RWC of both diploid genotypes drastically declined to 55-62%. The ion leakage percentage also was significantly lower in tetraploid explants at 15% PEG treatment. According to the results, these superiorities could be attributed to higher levels of stress response hormones including abscisic acid, salicylic acid, and jasmonic acid at different PEG treatments, the robust osmotic adjustment by significantly increased total soluble sugar (TSS), proline, and glycine betaine contents, and augmented enzymatic defense system including significantly increased superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities in tetraploid genotypes, compared to their diploid control genotypes. Consequently, the current study results demonstrated that the 'Sabz' tetraploid genotype had a significantly higher water stress tolerance than other tested genotypes.

J	Qi, YL; Wei, W; Li, JR; Chen, CG; Huang, YY				Qi, Yulin; Wei, Wei; Li, Junran; Chen, Cungen; Huang, Yuanyuan			Effects of terracing on root distribution of <i>Pinus tabulaeformis</i> Carr. forest and soil properties in the Loess Plateau of China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Terracing is one of the most effective ecological engineering practices that improve soil anti-erosivity properties and support plant growth in the dryland loess hilly area and other similar regions. The objective of the study was to understand the vertical distribution of root in different terraces and their relationships with soil environmental factors in the Loess Plateau of China. The vertical root distribution in the 0-400 cm soil profile, fine root distribution and soil moisture, soil nutrients (soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus) and soil anti-erosivity in 0-160 cmsoil profiles (every 20 cm for one layer) were investigated using the ground-penetrating radar and soil coring methods in a Pinus tabulaeformis Carr. forest under three terrace types during the growing season of 2018. We highlight several key findings here. First, level benches had the highest root density (18.14 kg m(-2)), followed by fish-scale pits (13.95 kg m(-2)) and reverse-slope terraces (9.84 kg m(-2)), as well as the highest soilwater content, nutrients and soil stability. Second, terracing caused significant differences in root distribution (P < 0.05), leading to the variation of soilmoisture, nutrients, anti-erosivity (explained over 80% variation) and reduced spatial heterogeneities of soil water content and nutrients. Third, fine root density parameters attained the highest values in the topsoil (0-40 cm soil layer) and decreased with increasing soil depth in all the three terrace types (P < 0.05). Finally, fine roots contributed to soilwater improvement, nutrient promotion and soil stabilization, while higher density of coarse rootsmight consume soil nutrients and reduce soil anti-erosivity. We thus suggest that level benches could be a more suitable terracing measure for plantation of P. tabulaeformis Carr., and to achieve soil melioration and fixation during the ecosystem restoration process in the Loess Plateau and other arid and semiarid regions.

J	Yao, YF; Song, JX; Wei, XR				Yao, Yufei; Song, Jinxi; Wei, Xiaorong			The fate of carbon in check dam sediments	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Check dams are small engineering structures. They are used worldwide for soil and water conservation, gully rehabilitation, hydrological regulation, and food supply. Eroded materials trapped and buried in check dams constitute an important carbon (C) sink. However, as a typical deposition site, systematic information about C cycling processes in check dams is relatively unknown, despite its crucial role in estimating the fate of buried C and elucidating the ongoing C sink/source debate on soil erosion. This study reviewed the stock, source, enrichment, distribution, stability, and underlying mechanisms of sediment C in check dams. Current studies have found a large amount of C stored in check dams (approximately 1-30 Mg C km-2 yr? 1), and have demonstrated that C retention ability relied more on factors governing sediment production and trapping at larger scales than on check dam trapping efficiency at smaller scales. Stable isotopes, radiocarbon, geochemical properties, biomarkers, and spectroscopy methods have proven to be practical in identifying the sources of sediment C but can only be used in certain situations because of their intrinsic limitations. Both enrichment and impoverishment of sediment C compared with source soils have been reported, and have depended on soil erosion type, land-use type, sediment connectivity, and the loss of C during transportation. Sediment C generally increases from the back of the check dam to the front along the flow pathway and fluctuates vertically, depending on the clay and sand layers of the deposition couplets. Information about C mineralization and sequestration is relatively limited, and the existing studies have shown reduced C mineralization and promoted C-fixing potential in check dam sediments. Given the specific benefits of deposition couplets in reflecting information about burial period, erosion intensity, and historical land use, further studies should integrate C stability with soil erosion and deposition information for the deposit profiles. The responses of C cycling to climate change and human disturbances, such as warming, dam-break, tillage, and fertilization for check dam sediments require further research.

We examined the interacting effects of clipping and topography (slope aspect and slope position) on the aboveground biomass and carbon (C) and nutrient concentration of graminoid and forb, as well as on soil organic carbon (OC) and nutrient content in a restored grassland under long-term grazing exclusion. Clipping increased the aboveground biomass of forb and total community, and decreased most C and nutrient concentration in aboveground biomass, but did not influence the aboveground biomass of graminoid or the content of soil OC and nutrient. Slope aspect did not change the effects of clipping on most plant aboveground biomass, or soil OC and nutrients. However, slope position altered the effects of clipping on soil inorganic nitrogen, total phosphorus, and available potassium, with lower nutrient levels on the upper slope but higher nutrient levels on the middle and lower slopes. The results demonstrate that slope position should be considered in predicting the response of soil biogeochemical processes to clipping in hilly semiarid restored grasslands.

The study evaluated the effects of sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.) intercropping time and stand density on radiation interception and radiation use efficiency (RUE) in a maizebased system. Field experiments were conducted under the in-field rainwater harvesting (IRWH) technique for two consecutive growing seasons, 2019/20 and 2020/21. Radiation interception and productivity were measured and calculated for maize and sunn hemp, sole and intercrops. The intercrops were identified by the sunn hemp intercropping times [simultaneous with maize planting (P1), at V15 maize growth stage (P2), at R1 maize growth stage (P3)] and stand densities [16 plants m-2 (D1-low), 32 plants m-2 (D2-medium), 48 plants m-2 (D3-high)]. Total radiation interception was calculated using a row-crop radiation transmission (RCRT) model from strip width of component crops, extinction coefficient (k), plant height, and leaf area index (LAI) measurements taken throughout the growing season. The results showed that the LAI of sunn hemp was high when intercrop was planted simultaneous with maize planting and at 48 plants m-2. The overall k for the sole sunn hemp (SSH) cropping system was 0.37. The correlations (r2) between the modelled and measured fractions of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) in simultaneous maize planting, V15 maize growth stage, and R1 maize growth stage intercropping treatments were 0.87, 0.97 and 0.93, respectively. Simultaneous planting of sunn hemp intercrop with maize captured the most growing season PAR of 798.70 MJ m-2 and had the highest RUE of 1.42 g MJ-1. These results suggest that intercropped sunn hemp planted simultaneously with maize would help to increase production through the more efficient use of solar radiation. Optimising planting time and density can help plan the planting time to increase radiation utilisation in maize/sunn hemp intercropping systems.

J	Huang, ZJ; Xu, JH; Zheng, LL				Huang, Zijin; Xu, Jianhua; Zheng, Lilin			Long-Term Change of Lake Water Storage and Its Response to Climate Change for Typical Lakes in Arid Xinjiang, China	WATER												Lakes play a role as the sentinel of climate change. Surrounded by vast expanses of barren land with limited infrastructure, there is also a lack of knowledge about the dynamics of dryland lakes. The change of lake area can be effectively monitored by remote sensing, and multi-source satellite altimetry datasets provide the possibility to obtain long-term lake water level data. Using the Global Surface Water Monthly Historical dataset and altimetry water level dataset (Hydroweb), we reconstructed a time series of lake water storage changes in Xinjiang, Northwestern China, by establishing the empirical models based on the statistical relationship between the surface area and water level of each lake. We further explored lake response to climate change. The results show that the storage of water at Ayakkum Lake, Aqqikkol Lake and Aksayquin Lake have been undergoing an obvious expanding trend from 2000 to 2020, at a rate of 3.59x10(8)m(3)/a, 9.43x10(8)m(3)/a and 0.44x10(8)m(3)/a, respectively. In the plain and transition zone, Ulungur Lake showed an upward tendency (0.413x10(8)m(3)/a) in water storage, while Manas Lake and Bosten Lake experienced shrinkage with descending rates of -0.1x10(8)m(3)/a and -0.86x10(8)m(3)/a. Temperature changes significantly affect the lake water storage on plateaus, especially those lakes supplied with a large proportion of glacial meltwater. Precipitation is a key factor for changes of lake storage in the plain and transition zones. Meanwhile, extreme weather and man-made factors also play crucial roles. To reduce the risk of flood and drought disasters, rational regulation of water resources is required, and a large-scale integrated catchment management plan can avoid inadvertent trade-offs. This research provides a new perspective for lake water storage inversion, as well as data support for water resources management in arid areas including Xinjiang.

Constraining organic matter composition and dynamics as a dominant driver of hypoxic blackwater risk during river Murray floodplain inundation	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The ecology of floodplain ecosystems evolved according to the historical frequency and extent of inundation. In many dryland rivers, inundation frequency has reduced due to regulation, competition for water resources and climate change. In some rivers infrastructure has been constructed to enable temporary rises in water level and more frequent floodplain inundation, delivering environmental water to ecosystems that are dependent on surface water. During such events, the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from inundated plant material may result in depletion of dissolved oxygen (DO). If the rate of DO depletion exceeds re-aeration, hypoxic conditions can occur. Models have been developed to represent these processes, however, there is a wide range of chemical and biological interactions, and hence model parameters, involved. The aim of this research was: (1) identify the dominant parameters through sensitivity analysis, (2) design and implement a field monitoring program to quantify the inherent variability in those parameters, and (3) translate that input variability into the modelled DO, ultimately to support risk management decisions when planning delivery of environmental water. The results indicated that the mass of organic matter on a floodplain had the greatest impact on the modelled DO concentrations. Based on the field monitoring results, the steady state load of organic matter, that is, when the accumulation and decay rates are equal, was estimated, and vegetation mapping used to apply the field monitoring results across the floodplain for a 206 km reach of river of the River Murray, Australia. The model results from multiple, cumulative, operations identified one particular high-risk operational site. The results are useful to prioritize monitoring effort to focus on the most sensitive model parameters and indicate that the likelihood of hypoxic conditions can be reduced through slower rates of inundation and timing events to coincide with periods with lower water temperature. The methodology developed can be transferred to other sites where hypoxic conditions are a potential outcome associated with delivery of environmental water.

Generation Mean Analysis Reveals the Predominant Gene Effects for Grain Iron and Zinc Contents in Pearl Millet	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.] is a climate-resilient dryland cereal that has been identified as a potential staple food crop that can contribute to alleviating micronutrient malnutrition, particularly with respect to grain iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) contents, in Sub-Saharan Africa and India. In this regard, an understanding of the inheritance pattern of genes involved in Fe and Zn contents is vital for devising appropriate breeding methods to genetically enhance their levels in grains. In this study, we aimed to determine the genetic effects underlying such inheritance and their interactions based on the generation mean analyses. Four experimental crosses and their six generations (P-1, P-2, F-1, BCP1, BCP2, and F-2) were independently evaluated in a compact family block design in 2017 rainy and 2018 summer seasons. ANOVA revealed highly significant mean squares (p < 0.01) among different generations for grain Fe and Zn contents. Six-parameter generation mean analyses revealed a predominance of additive genetic effect and a significant (p < 0.05) additive x dominant interaction for the grain Fe content. The additive genetic effect for the grain Zn content was also highly significant (p < 0.01). However, interaction effects contributed minimally with respect to most of the crosses for the grain Zn content and hence we assume that a simple digenic inheritance pattern holds true for it. Furthermore, we established that narrow-sense heritability was high for the grain Fe content (>61.78%), whereas it was low to moderate for the grain Zn content (30.60-59.04%). The lack of superior parent heterosis coupled with non-significant inbreeding depression for Fe and Zn contents in grains further confirmed the predominance of an additive genetic effect. These findings will contribute to strategizing a comprehensive breeding method to exploit the available variability of grain Fe and Zn contents for the development of biofortified hybrids of pearl millet.																			1664-462X					JAN 28	2022	12								693680	10.3389/fpls.2021.693680	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.693680								35154168					WOS:000760259900001

In this paper, we focused on a loess section at Xiazhupan (XZP) Village, Penglai City in Shandong Peninsula, the only known coastal loess bluffs preserved in China. The coastal loess here not only has characteristics that are common to loess terrains such as being composed of predominantly silt-sized particles and the tendency to stand in vertical exposures, but it also reportedly preserves planktonic foraminifera, sizable pebbles and volcanic glass. In addition to its peculiar near-shore locality, these features make it more unusual compared to other loess deposits. Systematic optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL and pIRIR) and radiocarbon dating reveal it was deposited mostly during 60-20 ka, Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 4-2, which correlates to the deposition of the Malan loess (L1) in the Chinese Loess Plateau. High-resolution grain size data indicate that the coastal loess is relatively coarse-grained, suggesting a source terrain that is at least partially proximal. Given its proximal source and the geochronological evidence, this coastal loess was sourced from the exposed continental shelf during the sea-level lowstand of the last glacial period, and this hypothesis is further supported by a core collected from the Bohai Sea in which silt was present and would have been subaerially exposed during MIS 4-2. In addition, this source area of exposed continental shelf is comparable to coastal loess in Europe. The coastal loess in Shandong can be regarded as a special type of desert or dryland loess, rather than glacial loess. Finally, future sea level rise will likely increase the erosion potential of these vulnerable coastal loess bluffs, making it urgent to study this special landform.

Spatial and temporal analysis of the mid-summer dry spells for the summer rainfall region of South Africa	WATER SA												South Africa is frequently subjected to severe droughts and dry spells during the rainy season. As such, rainfall is one of the most significant factors limiting dryland crop production in South Africa. The mid-summer period is particularly important for agriculture since a lack of rain during this period negatively affects crop yields. Dry spell frequency analyses are used to investigate the impacts of sub-seasonal rainfall variability on crop yield, since seasonal rainfall totals alone do not explain the relationship between rainfall and crop yields. This study investigated the spatial and temporal occurrences of the mid-summer dry spells based on magnitude, length and time of occurrence in the major maize growing areas of the summer rainfall region of South Africa. Three thresholds of 5 mm, 10 mm, and 15 mm total rainfall for a pentad were used for the analysis of dry spells. Dry spell analysis showed that dry pentads occur during mid-summer with differing intensity, duration and frequency across the summer rainfall region. Annual frequency of dry pentads for the mid-summer period ranged between 0 and 4 pentads for the 5 mm threshold and 1 to 7 for the 10 mm and 15 mm thresholds. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend analysis of the dry pentads indicates that there is no significant trend in the frequency of dry spells at a 95% confidence level. The initial and conditional probabilities of getting a dry spell using the Markov chain model also showed that there is a 32% to 80% probability that a single pentad will be dry using the 15 mm threshold. There is a 5% to 48% probability of experiencing two consecutive dry pentads and 1% to 29% probability of getting three consecutive dry pentads. The duration and intensity of dry spells, as well as the Markov chain probabilities, showed a decrease in dry spells from west to east of the maize-growing areas of the summer rainfall region of South Africa.

Soil variability affects confidence in the use of common agroecosystem soil indicators	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												There is a need for accurate and easily-measured indicators suitable for characterising and monitoring agroecosystem multi-functionality. This is particularly true in intensively-farmed landscapes where it is of interest to quantify the role of small, woody vegetation features in providing ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration. However, soil variability introduced by natural and management processes can interact with sampling designs to result in inappropriate sampling intensities and high levels of uncertainty in measured indicators. This can have consequences for upscaling of ecosystem quantities and decision making. Here, we present results from a pilot study aimed at quantifying and understanding variation in ten common indicators of soil condition and function, within shelterbelt and adjacent field soils, at four dryland sheep farms in Canterbury, New Zealand. Our results demonstrate a high level of spatially-structured soil variability, driven by (1) the effects of woody vegetation on shelterbelt soils relative to field soils, (2) differences in underlying soil types among sites, and (3) possible effects of grazing animals within fields. This soil variability had clear knock-on impacts for appropriate sampling effort, depending on the soil indicator in question, the original soil sampling density, and whether the aim was to estimate population mean values or to detect differences among sites with confidence. On the whole, confidence in soil indicator estimates was highest for soil condition indicators (pH, soil moisture, bulk density), variable for carbon quantities, depending on the measure used, and lowest for soil biological process indicators (tea bag index decomposition rate, bait lamina probe micro-invertebrate activity, and dehydrogenase enzyme activity); estimation confidence was also mostly lower for shelterbelt soils due to the effect of woody roots and inputs on soil variability. Based on our results, we present indicative sample size requirements to estimate population means for these different soil indicators. Ultimately, we advocate for the use of pilot studies, such as the one presented here, to facilitate understanding of variability in soil function indicators within different agroecosystems, and how this variability is partitioned spatially within and among vegetated features.

BIOLOGY-BASEL												Simple Summary The most harmful storage pest of pulses is known to be the bruchid or pulse beetle, especially in the tropics and subtropics. Chemical insecticides work well to reduce bruchid infestation; however, they have negative effects on the health of food consumers. One of the best mitigating methods among efficient, safe and sustainable strategies to lessen crop losses during storage is the development of pulse-beetle-resistant cultivars. Unfortunately, the majority of pulses lack resistance to the pulse beetle. Consequently, it is necessary to look for pulse beetle resistance in wild and exotic germplasms. Identifying potential donors for pulse beetle resistance and examining their characters in bruchid-susceptible and -resistant genotypes were the goals of the present investigation. Among the tested genotypes, two genotypes, i.e., PRR 2008-2 and PRR 2008-2-sel, were found to be highly resistant, and one accession, TCR-93, was found to be resistant to the pulse beetle. The biochemical basis of resistance modulated by the basal expression of antioxidants in highly resistant genotypes has also been studied. Currently, a quicker option for generating substantial genetic gain for desired trait improvement is molecular breeding. In the present investigation, start codon targets (SCoT) markers were used to analyse the genetic differences. Pulses are a key source of dietary proteins in human nutrition. Despite several efforts to increase the production, various constraints, such as biotic and abiotic factors, threaten pulse production by various means. Bruchids (Callosobruchus spp.) are the serious issue of concern, particularly in storage conditions. Understanding host-plant resistance at morphological, biochemical and molecular levels is the best way to minimize yield losses. The 117 mungbean (Vigna radiata L. Wilczek) genotypes, including endemic wild relatives, were screened for resistance against Callosobruchus chinensis; among them, two genotypes, PRR 2008-2 and PRR 2008-2-sel, which belong to V. umbellata (Thumb.), were identified as highly resistant. The expression of antioxidants in susceptible and resistant genotypes revealed that the activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) was upregulated in the highly resistant wild Vigna species and lower in the cultivated susceptible genotypes, along with other biomarkers. Further, the SCoT-based genotyping revealed SCoT-30 (200 bp), SCoT-31 (1200 bp) and SCoT-32 (300 bp) as unique amplicons, which might be useful for developing the novel ricebean-based SCAR markers to accelerate the molecular breeding programme.

The scarcity of water and feed for sheep is a characteristic feature in the dryland areas of South Africa, and adversely affects meat production and quality. To address this challenge, breeds with high water, feed and production efficiencies must be used to produce meat of desirable quality. Aim. The study aimed to compare physicochemical, volatile compounds, oxidative and sensory profiles of the Longissimus muscle from selected South African sheep breeds raised under intensive feeding conditions. Methods. Physicochemical, oxidative, volatile compounds and sensory profiles of the Longissimus muscle from lambs of indigenous (Damara, n = 10; Pedi, n = 8), indigenous composite (Dorper, n = 10; Meatmaster, n = 9) and exotic composite (Dohne Merino, n = 10; South African Merino, n = 10) breeds that were penned individually and fed a lamb -finishing diet ad libitum over a 42-day test period were evaluated. Results. Dohne Merino had the highest intramuscular fat content, whereas Damara and Pedi had the lowest (P <= 0.05). Meat lightness increased over time, with Pedi having the highest values on Day 7 of retail display at 4 degrees C, followed by the Merinos (P <= 0.05). On Day 7, meat from the Merinos had the highest lipid oxidation values, whereas Damara and Pedi had the lowest (P <= 0.05). The lowest meat protein oxidation values on Day 7 were recorded for the Meatmaster, followed by Dohne Merino (P <= 0.05). Relative to the other breeds, Dohne Merino had the greatest concentrations of alcohols, aldehydes and acidic volatile compounds, and the lowest concentrations of esters (P <= 0.05). In addition, the Merinos had meat that was slightly more tender and juicy (P <= 0.05) than that of Damara and Dorper. Conclusions. Even though indigenous breeds produced meat with comparable oxidative shelf-life and sensory quality attributes to composite breeds under intensive feeding conditions, they had leaner meat than the later breeds. Implications. The observed variations in meat physicochemical and oxidative shelf-life parameters allow producers to select breeds that are best suited to their production systems, resources and market requirements.

Dryland vegetation is more sensitive to climate change and human activities. China's drylands are among the largest in extent worldwide, and large-scale ecological restoration of these areas has been implemented since the late 1970s, which has resulted in more complicated but still poorly quantified vegetation dynamics. To figure out the vegetation dynamics and associated driving forces, we provide an assessment of the vegetation dynamics from 1982 to 2015 using the CO2 fertilization effect function, principal component regression, Residual Trend analysis, and Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend methods based on the ERA5 climate factors and GIMMS 3.1 normalized difference vegetation index datasets. This study shows that anthropogenic impacts and CO2 fertilization have jointly led to vegetation greening in China's drylands since the 1980s, and ecological restoration has accelerated this greening since the 2000s. The results show that the vegetation greening in China's drylands (41.51% of the study area, +0.60 x 10(-3) yr(-1)) is mainly driven by CO2 fertilization (+0.55 x 10(-3) yr(-1)) and anthropogenic activities (+0.12 x 10(-3) yr(-1)). The anthropogenic effects are especially higher on the Loess Plateau (+1.01 x 10(-3) yr(-1)) and the Three-North region (+0.23 x 10(-3) yr(-1)). The vegetation dynamics shifts in 6.73% (31.64 Mha) of China's drylands were directly attributed to anthropogenic impacts around the 2000s. When the anthropogenic effect was intensified, the vegetation dynamics shifted from no change to greening and vice versa, which significantly intensified the vegetation greening since the 1980s. These results capture the processes of ecological programs and provide an assessment of the effects of ecological restoration. This work provides a credible attribution of the vegetation greenness dynamics and trend shifts in China's drylands, thus facilitating a better understanding of regional environmental change and management.

Orchard after Long-Term Flood Irrigation	AGRICULTURE-BASEL												Jujube tree yields in dryland saline soils are restricted by water shortages and soil salinity. Converting traditional flood irrigation to drip irrigation would solve water deficit and salt stress. The root distribution reacts primarily to the availability of water and nutrients. However, there is little information about the response of jujube roots to the change from flood irrigation to drip irrigation. In this context, a two-year experiment was carried out to reveal the effects of the change from long-term flood irrigation to drip irrigation on soil water, root distribution, fruit yield, and water use efficiency (WUE) of jujube trees. In this study, drip irrigation amounts were designed with three levels, i.e., 880 mm (W1), 660 mm (W2), 440 mm (W3), and the flood irrigation of 1100 mm was designed as the control (CK). The results showed that replacing flood irrigation with drip irrigation significantly altered soil water distribution and increased soil moisture in the topsoil (0-40 cm). In the drip irrigation treatments with high levels, soil water storage in the 0-60 cm soil layer at the flowering and fruit setting, and fruit swelling stages of jujube trees increased significantly compared with the flood irrigation. After two consecutive years of drip irrigation, the treatments with higher irrigation levels increased root length density (RLD) in 0-60 cm soil depth but decreased that in the 60-100 cm depth. In the horizontal direction, higher irrigation levels increased RLD in the distance of 0-50 cm, while reducing RLD in the distance of 50-100 cm. However, the opposite conclusion was obtained in W3 treatment. Additionally, in the second year of drip irrigation, W2 treatment (660 mm) significantly improved yield and WUE, with an increasing of 7.6% for yield and 60.3% for WUE compared to the flood irrigation. In summary, converting flood irrigation to drip irrigation is useful in regulating root distribution and improving WUE, which would be a promising method in jujube cultivation in arid regions.																				2077-0472				DEC	2021	11	12							1184	10.3390/agriculture11121184	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11121184													WOS:000735369400001

However, the responses of soil microbial survival strategies to wet and dry events are poorly understood. In this study, soil physicochemical properties, enzyme activity, and high-throughput sequencing results were comprehensively anal0079zed in the irrigated cropland ecological zone of the northern plains of the Yellow River floodplain of China, where Oryza sativa was grown for a long period of time, converted to Zea mays after a year, and then Glycine max was planted. The results showed that different plant cultivations in a paddy-dryland rotation system affected soil physicochemical properties and enzyme activity, and G. max field cultivation resulted in higher total carbon, total nitrogen, soil total organic carbon, and available nitrogen content while significantly increasing alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucosidase, and alkaline phosphatase activities in the soil. In addition, crop rotation altered the r/K-strategist bacteria, and the soil environment was the main factor affecting the community structure of r/K-strategist bacteria. The co-occurrence network revealed the inter-relationship between r/K-strategist bacteria and fungi, and with the succession of land rotation, the G. max sample plot exhibited more stable network relationships. Random forest analysis further indicated the importance of soil electrical conductivity, total carbon, total nitrogen, soil total organic carbon, available nitrogen, and alpha-glucosidase in the composition of soil microbial communities under wet-dry events and revealed significant correlations with r/K-strategist bacteria. Based on the functional predictions of microorganisms, wet-dry conversion altered the functions of bacteria and fungi and led to a more significant correlation between soil nutrient cycling taxa and environmental changes. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of microbial functional groups while helping to further our understanding of the potential functions of soil microbial functional groups in soil ecosystems.

Exploring the benefits and dis-benefits of climate migration as an adaptive strategy along the rural-peri-urban continuum in Namibia	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												The scale of climate migration across the Global South is expected to increase during this century. By 2050, millions of Africans are likely to consider, or be pushed into, migration because of climate hazards contributing to agricultural disruption, water and food scarcity, desertification, flooding, drought, coastal erosion, and heat waves. However, the migration-climate nexus is complex, as is the question of whether migration can be considered a climate change adaptation strategy across both the rural and urban space. Combining data from household surveys, key informant interviews, and secondary sources related to regional disaster, demographic, resource, and economic trends between 1990 and 2020 from north central and central dryland Namibia, we investigate (i) human migration flows and the influence of climate hazards on these flows and (ii) the benefits and dis-benefits of migration in supporting climate change adaptation, from the perspective of migrants (personal factors and intervening obstacles), areas of origin, and areas of destination. Our analysis suggests an increase in climate-related push factors that could be driving rural out-migration from the north central region to peri-urban settlements in the central region of the country. While push factors play a role in rural-urban migration, there are also several pull factors (many of which have been long-term drivers of urban migration) such as perceived higher wages, diversity of livelihoods, water, health and energy provisioning, remittances, better education opportunities, and the exchange of non-marketed products. Migration to peri-urban settlements can reduce some risks (e.g. loss of crops and income due to climate extremes) but amplify others (e.g. heat stress and insecure land tenure). Adaptation at both ends of the rural-urban continuum is supported by deeply embedded linkages in a model of circular rural-urban-rural migration and interdependencies. Results empirically inform current and future policy debates around climate mobilities in Namibia, with wider implications across Africa.

So far, few studies have analyzed the macromolecular and chemical characteristics of the polysaccharidic matrix in induced cyanobacterial biocrusts and the scarce existing studies have mainly focused on sandy soil textures. However, the characteristics of the cyanobacterial polysaccharidic matrix may greatly depend on soil type. The objective of this study was to examine the macromolecular distribution and monosaccharidic composition of the polysaccharidic matrix induced by inoculation of two cyanobacterial species common in arid environments, Phormidium ambiguum (non N-fixing) and Scytonema javanicum (N-fixing) in different soil types. S. javanicum promoted a higher release in the soil of the more soluble and less condensed EPS fraction (i.e., the loosely bound EPS fraction, LB-EPS), while P. ambiguum showed a higher release of the less soluble and more condensed EPS fraction (i.e., the tightly bound EPS fraction, TB-EPS). LB-EPSs were mainly composed of low MW molecules (<50kDa), while TB-EPSs were mainly composed of high MW molecules (1100-2000kDa). The two EPS fractions showed a complex monosaccharidic composition (from 11 to 12 different types of monosaccharides), with glucose as the most abundant monosaccharide, in particular in the poorer soils characterized by lower organic C contents. In more C-rich soils, high abundances of galactose, mannose, and xylose were also found. Low abundance of uronic acids and hydrophobic monosaccharides, such as fucose and rhamnose, was found in the EPS extracted from the inoculated soils. Our results point to the influence of soil type on the macromolecular distribution and monosaccharide composition of the polysaccharidic matrix in induced biocrusts, which is likely to affect biocrust development and their role in soil structure and nutrient cycling in restored dryland soils.

Results In order to develop means of biological control appropriate to the conditions of southern Tunisia, the efficacy of the native strain of the predator Nesidiocoris tenuis Reuter (Hemiptera: Miridae) and two entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) Beauveria bassiana and Lecanicillium muscarium was tested against Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius). Indeed, the introduction of N. tenuis in doses of 1, 2, 3, or 4 nymphs per tobacco plant infested by the whitefly led to highly significant reduction in the population of B. tabaci, than the control devoid of predator. The efficacy of N. tenuis was very high against nymphs and adults of B. tabaci at all doses per plant with a rate of 98%. Likewise, B. bassiana and L. muscarium, compared to an untreated control, showed a very significant efficacy against larvae and adults of B. tabaci. In addition, the number of live nymphs of N. tenuis treated directly or introduced on nymphs of B. tabaci treated with the EPF remained relatively high, exceeding 24.8 nymphs per cage compared to the control (28.6). Conclusions It can be concluded that the native strain of N. tenuis and the EPF tested separately were effective against B. tabaci. Their combined use appears to be possible.																			1110-1768	2536-9342				MAR 8	2021	31	1							47	10.1186/s41938-021-00395-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s41938-021-00395-5													WOS:000627379300001

Climate change and large-scale ecological restoration have led to significant vegetation greening and soil moisture (SM) variations in the drylands. However, the influencing mechanisms of climate change and vege-tation greening on SM variability were not well understood. In this study, the spatiotemporal variations of climate variables, vegetation cover, surface SM (SM_surf) and root-zone SM (SM_root) along aridity gradient in the drylands of northern China during 1981-2018 were investigated. The random forest model and partial least-squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) analysis were employed to quantify the contributions of climate change and vegetation greening to SM variability and identify the influencing pathways. The climate change showed temporal trends of wetting to drying before 2000 and drying to more wetting in 2000-2018, and vegetation greening was significant in 2000-2018. The variations of SM displayed obvious east-negative and west-positive trends. The temporal trend of SM deficit decreased during 1981-2018 in most regions, and SM showed a significant increasing trend in all regions of different aridity gradient after 2000. The correlations of climate factors and vegetation cover with SM became stronger in the area with lower aridity. The vegetation greening-induced SM change was limited compared to climate change. The climate factors can directly impact SM availability, and also indirectly influence SM availability through vegetation (e.g., precip-itation-*LAI-*SM_surf). The SM_surf had positive responses to vegetation greening, especially in semiarid sub-area. In contrast, vegetation greening exacerbated SM_root consumption in semiarid and dry subhumid subareas, which became intensive after 2000. This study fills the knowledge gap in the underlying reasons for the vari-ations of both surface and root zone SM in water-limited areas and reveals the potential risks of SM depletion, particularly in dry subhumid areas.						gao, guang yao/0000-0001-7021-8652													0168-1923	1873-2240				DEC 15	2023	343								109786	10.1016/j.agrformet.2023.109786	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2023.109786													WOS:001102369100001

However, information on nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates for RT systems is limited. The objectives of this long-term study were to determine agronomic and economical optimal N rates for a continuous winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) system under RT at different yield environments. This study was conducted at Kansas State University Agricultural Research Center near Hays, KS, from 1971 through 2003. There were six N fertilizer rate treatments (0, 22, 45, 67, 90, and 112 kg N ha-1) arranged in a randomized complete block design with six replications. Over the 33 years, winter wheat yields ranged from a minimum of 370 kg ha-1 to a maximum of 3948 kg ha-1 with mean yield of 2015 kg ha-1 and standard deviation of 669 kg ha-1. Agronomic optimal N rates for wheat varied from 70 in very low yield (VLY) to 79 kg N ha-1 in very high yield (VHY) environment. The economic optimal N rates estimated for continuous wheat ranged from 59 in VLY to 71 kg N ha-1 in VHY environments. However, net profits from fertilizer application ranged from $63 in VLY to $443 ha-1 in VHY environment. We concluded that applying 60-70 kg N ha-1 would optimize dryland continuous RT wheat yields and profitability, but N removal and recovery efficiency (grain N [applied N]-1) are less in lower yielding environments. Agronomic optimal N rates ranged from 70 to 79 kg N ha-1 across yield environments.Yield at agronomic optimal rate significantly varied across yield environments and ranged from 1246 to 3332 kg ha-1.The estimated economic optimal N rates ranged from 59 to 71 kg N ha-1 across environments.Revenue at economic optimal N rate varied by yield environments and ranged from $63 to $443 ha-1.

Doubled Haploid Population Derived from Tugela-DN x Elands	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Grain yield is a quantitatively inherited complex trait that is strongly influenced by interacting genetic and environmental factors. The identification of major quantitative trait loci (QTL) for plant height (PH) and yield component traits (YCT) is important for improving yield potential through wheat breeding. We performed a QTL analysis for PH and YCT in the Tugela-DN x Elands doubled haploid (DH) population using a genotype-by-sequence single nucleotide polymorphism and a silicoDArT-based genetic map. Field trials were conducted under rain-fed conditions across five environments in the Free State Province of South Africa during the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 cropping seasons. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences (p < 0.001) among DH lines and the environments. However, for G x E interactions, significant differences (p < 0.05) were only observed for spikelet number per spike. Broad-sense heritability estimates of all traits ranged between 0.44 and 0.81. Nine QTL, viz. QPh.sgi-6A.2 and QPh.sgi-4D for PH, QSl.sgi-6A.2 and QSl.sgi-7A for spike length, QGns.sgi-3B for grain number per spike (GNS), QGwps.sgi-7B for grain weight per spike (GWPS), QGw.sgi-2A and QGw.sgi-7A for grain width, and QGl.sgi-3B for grain length (GL), were identified on chromosomes 2A, 3B, 4D, 6A, 7A, and 7B, in two or more environments. Some of these QTL exhibited pleiotropic effects. The QPh.sgi-6A.2 QTL for PH and QGwps.sgi-7B for GWPS appear to be novel QTL, while the rest of the reported QTL validated previously identified QTL for PH and YCT. The study also reported a trade-off between GL and GNS. The findings of this study will be useful in elucidating the genetic architecture of yield component traits contributing to the development of new dryland wheat varieties with high and stable yield.

A field study in the 2016/17 and 2017/18 seasons was conducted at Luancheng station in the North China Plain (NCP) to investigate winter wheat cultivars with high-yielding characteristics under water deficit conditions. The experiment contained two parts, with part one involving 10 cultivars of winter wheat grown under I0 (rainfed), I1 (one irrigation) and I2 (two irrigations) treatments and part two involving 32 cultivars grown under I1 treatment. The three irrigation regimes I0, I1, and I2 provided approximately 60 %, 70 % and 80 % of the seasonal potential evapotranspiration, respectively. Yield variations were up to 47 % among the 10 cultivars in the two seasons, and several cultivars could produce continuously higher yields than those of other cultivars under the different treatments. High-yielding cultivars produced higher water productivity than that of other cultivars. No single agronomic or physiological characteristics, except for biomass, could explain the yield differences among cultivars. However, canopy temperature (CT) during the grain filling stage had a continuous negative linear correlation with grain yield under limited water supply conditions in a high-yielding environment. The results indicated that the genetic variation in grain yield might be attributed to the ability to withdraw soil water, especially the deeper soil water, during the grain filling stage, which would result in a cooler canopy. CT as an indicator of high-yielding cultivars was further confirmed among the 32 cultivars under I1 treatment in the 2016/17. A relative adequate water supply during the grain filling stage also prolonged leaf greenness which was beneficial to dry matter production and grain yield. Therefore, the ability to efficiently utilize soil water and maintain dry matter production during the grain filling stage are two important characteristics for maintaining the high yield of winter wheat under water deficit conditions in the NCP.					zongzheng, Yan/AAV-1389-2020; LI, Jing/HNB-5575-2023; li, xiao/GSN-6181-2022	zongzheng, Yan/0000-0002-4848-4089; 													0378-3774	1873-2283				DEC 1	2020	242								106410	10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106410	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106410													WOS:000571378500002

Strategy of Technical Support of Grain Harvesting Operations in Republic of Kazakhstan	AMA-AGRICULTURAL MECHANIZATION IN ASIA AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA												The regions of Kazakhstan are characterized by a sharply continental climate with a lack of moisture. Grain yield is low and is about of 0.7-2.5 tons per hectare. In the South, East and West there is a number of small farms. In the North, where large agricultural enterprises are placed, there is a shortage of mechanization personnel. Sixty percent of combine harvesters are older than 10 years. The research purpose is determining the optimal strategy of technical support of grain harvesting in different regions of Kazakhstan in accordance with agro-climatic and production conditions. Authors used analytical methods for calculating optimal variants and experimental studies. It was found that in the conditions of dryland agriculture of the South, West and East regions of the Republic it is necessary to use mainly combines of the 3rd class. In the conditions of irrigated agriculture of the South region, it is more expedient to use more productive combines of 5th and 6th classes. In the North region, the most effective are harvesters of 4th, 5th and 6th classes with wide reapers. The authors have found that the strategy of technical support of harvesting work in the Republic of Kazakhstan consists of a combination of the following technological decisions: integration of self-propelled combine harvesters of 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th classes with a dominant share of combines of 3rd and 4th classes in the park; rigging of combines of 3rd and 4th classes with the headers of width of 6-9 meters, and harvesters of 5th and 6th classes with the header of width of 9-12 meters; use of combines of 3rd and 4th classes on grain harvesting on farms, and harvesters of 5th and 6th classes in the areas of irrigated agriculture in large farms; the combination of three harvesting technologies: direct harvesting, separate harvesting, combing ears out on the root; the use of grain storage bins for reloading and heavy-duty vehicles for transporting grain from combines reduces the required number of machines by 25-30%.

J	Fan, X; Zhang, W; Chen, WW; Chen, B				Fan, Xing; Zhang, Wen; Chen, Weiwei; Chen, Bin			Land-water-energy nexus in agricultural management for greenhouse gas mitigation	APPLIED ENERGY												Agriculture plays an important role in global climate change. The interaction and efficiency of use of land, water, and energy in agricultural activities are the principal factors affecting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and food production. However, comprehensive analysis exploring the mechanism of the land-water-energy system in agricultural production remains lacking. This study developed such a framework based on regional agricultural GHG emissions by combining top-down analysis that considered cross-sectoral interactions with bottom-up analysis that addressed the context-specific conditions of resources and technology. We employed the proposed framework to analyze the interaction of land-water-energy and factors influencing agricultural GHG emissions and to explore mitigation measures based on a case study of the Sanjiang Plain (China). Results showed cropland on the Sanjiang Plain produced 1.8 million tonnes of protein and released 10.9 million tonnes of CO(2)eq in 2015 using 3.0 million ha of arable land, 12.1 billion m(3) of water, and 100.4 PJ of energy. Owing to their high input of resources and flooded cultivation, rice fields produced 29% of total crop protein but consumed 51% of total crop water use, 43% of total crop energy use, and emitted 54% of total crop GHG (CO(2)eq). Structural adjustment through conversion of half the paddy fields into dryland crops (e.g., wheat) could mitigate GHG emissions by 18.8% in 2020 compared with the baseline scenario. However, such change would be almost impossible given the Sanjiang Plain is one of China's most important rice-producing areas. If integrated technology improvements were adopted, e.g., advanced crop-soil nutrition management, groundwater protection measures, water-saving irrigation technology, and low-carbon energy technology, GHG emissions could be reduced by 23.9% without sacrificing food production. This study used the nexus approach to analyze agricultural GHG emissions, providing a framework for sustainable agricultural management and a reference for understanding the land-water-energy nexus.

J	Gao, YQ; Chen, JH; Luo, H; Wang, HZ				Gao, Yuqin; Chen, Jiahui; Luo, Hao; Wang, Huaizhi			Prediction of hydrological responses to land use change	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The change of land use and land coverage (LULC) has a direct impact on the underlying surface of the drainage basin, hence alters the rainfall-runoff processes. This study described the procedure to use the CA-Markov model to predict the future distributed land use in the Qinhuai River basin in 2028 based on the historical evolution. The hydrological model HEC-HMS was then utilized to examine the impact of land use change on the hydrological responses of the drainage basin. The major findings were as follows: (1) from 2001 to 2010, major changes detected in land use were substantial conversion of paddy fields, forest land and dryland into urban land (increased by 56.81%), following the trend recognized by CA-Markov model, urban land and dry land were predicted to increase by 17.47% and 14.05% by 2028. (2) the projected land use in 2028 resulted in various degrees of increase in flood peak and volume according to the severity of the floods characterized by flood volumes, the smaller floods were predicted to result in more significant increase with 3.5% increase in flood peak and 2.9% increase in flood volume while these values decreased to 0.4% and 1.1% for a big scale flood; (3) greater increase in urbanization leads to greater change of the flood peak and volume change. For small scale floods, when the proportion of urban land use increases by 30% to 60% hypothetically, the relative increment in flood peaks increase from 4.7% to 8.1% with 4% to 6.6% increase in the flood volume; (4) on the sub-basin scale, the trend of change in urban land use and the flood peak and volume were consistent. The methods and conclusions may shed light on urban land development and management and design of flood control measures in a large river basin. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Few studies have examined the ecological relevance of dew/hoar frost to drought. We conducted an observational experiment regarding the frequency, duration, and amount of dew/hoar frost on both canopies and underlying surfaces of the Artemisia ordosica (AO) and Salix psammophila (SP)-two common species in northern China-using leaf wetness sensor (LWS) in a desert shrubland in Northwest China from May to December 2015. Potential dew/hoar frost was estimated using the Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation, while measuring meteorological parameters. Results showed that dew/hoar frost exhibited a significant diurnal variation that occurred mainly between 20:00 and 09:00 the following day, while peaking at about 04:00-06:00 (i.e., before dawn). The monthly mean duration of dew/hoar frost was longer in November and December, and shorter in May and June. Eighty percent of daily dew values were within 0-0.4 mm d-1. For SP, the durations of dew and hoar frost were both longer on the canopy than on the underlying surface. For AO, however, the duration of dew was longer and that of hoar frost was shorter on the canopy than on the underlying surface. The P-M equation may underestimate dew/hoar frost during cold times with higher wind speed. Dew may be an important water supply, especially during two periods of sharp declines of soil water during the long (the period > one month) and short term (the period < one month) droughts (equal to 63.77 and 96.18% of rainfall, respectively). Our findings suggest that AO is more conducive to the formation of dew/hoar frost than SP, and dew/hoar frost can serve as a sustainable significant water resource during periods of drought, especially in desert areas.

This cropping system has experienced a decreased crop yield and soil quality and the limiting factors are poorly known. The goal of this study was to conduct a systematic evaluation of wheat yield and soil quality from 132 fields along a regional scale in China. The specific objectives were (i) to establish a minimum data set (MDS) in wheat phase under the wheat-maize cropping system (ii) to evaluate soil quality of the wheat field and determine the factors limiting wheat productivity. The wheat-maize cropping system was partitioned into three productivity levels (high, medium and low) according to the wheat yield. Twenty-six soil indicators, including soil microbiological, chemical and physical factors were measured and analyzed. Using Pearson correlation analysis we identified eight key soil indicators that determine wheat yield. We then used principal component analysis to determine an MDS, which included soil organic matter, alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen, the ratio of microbial biomass nitrogen to total nitrogen, and available zinc. One-way analysis of variance based on the individual contribution of each MDS indicators under three productivity, revealed available nitrogen, soil organic matter and the ratio of microbial biomass nitrogen to total nitrogen was the most important indicators on limiting wheat yield. A soil quality index (SQI) based on scoring and weighting of MDS indicators was integrated as a tool for assessing farmland soil quality. Based on the MDS, high (HP), medium (MP) and low (LP) productivity received mean SQI of 0.55, 0.48 and 0.39, respectively. The significant positive correlation between SQI and wheat yield suggests that this is a good representative of the MDS for the wheat-maize cropping system in China. We conclude that our SQI may be an effective and practical tool to guide a strategic, regional goal with respect to sustainable high yields.

Controls on the presence and storage of soil inorganic carbon in a semi-arid watershed	CATENA												Soil inorganic carbon (SIC) constitutes-40-50% of the terrestrial soil carbon and is an integral part of the global carbon cycle. Rainfall is a primary factor controlling SIC accumulation; however, the distribution and hierarchy of controls on SIC development in arid and semi-arid regions is poorly understood. The Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW) in southwestern Idaho is an ideal location to study factors influencing SIC because it spans a wide mean annual precipitation range (235 mm to 900 mm) along a 1,425 to 2,111 m elevation gradient and has soils derived from a wide variety of parent materials (granite, basalt, dust, and al-luvium). We collected soil samples along this elevational gradient to understand local controls on SIC distri-butions. SIC content was quantified at 71 soil pits and/or augered cores collected between approximately 0-1 m depth or until refusal. Consistent with previous studies, we found variations in precipitation governed the presence or absence of SIC; field measurements of the top 1 m of soils confirm little or no SIC in soils receiving > 500 mm in mean annual precipitation. Below this 500 mm threshold, SIC pools varied substantially and significantly between sites. Results showed that 90% of sites (64 sites) contained less than 10 kg m- 2 SIC, 7% (5 sites) contained 10-20 kg m- 2, and 3% (2 sites) contain between 24 and 29 kg m- 2 SIC. The total SIC within RCEW was estimated at-5.17 x 105 Mg. After precipitation, slope consistently ranked as the second most important predictor of SIC accumulation in random forest analysis. Wind-blown dust likely contributed to SIC accumulation; prior work indicates an average dust flux rate in RCEW of about 11 +/- 4.9 g m- 2 year -1. This study provides an initial model predicting SIC distribution and accumulation in a shrub-dominated dryland watershed.

Surface indicators are correlated with soil multifunctionality in global drylands	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												Multiple ecosystem functions need to be considered simultaneously to manage and protect the several ecosystem services that are essential to people and their environments. Despite this, cost effective, tangible, relatively simple and globally relevant methodologies to monitor in situ soil multifunctionality, that is, the provision of multiple ecosystem functions by soils, have not been tested at the global scale. We combined correlation analysis and structural equation modelling to explore whether we could find easily measured, field-based indicators of soil multifunctionality (measured using functions linked to the cycling and storage of soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus). To do this, we gathered soil data from 120 dryland ecosystems from five continents. Two soil surface attributes measured in situ (litter incorporation and surface aggregate stability) were the most strongly associated with soil multifunctionality, even after accounting for geographic location and other drivers such as climate, woody cover, soil pH and soil electric conductivity. The positive relationships between surface stability and litter incorporation on soil multifunctionality were greater beneath the canopy of perennial vegetation than in adjacent, open areas devoid of vascular plants. The positive associations between surface aggregate stability and soil functions increased with increasing mean annual temperature. Synthesis and applications. Our findings demonstrate that a reduced suite of easily measured in situ soil surface attributes can be used as potential indicators of soil multifunctionality in drylands world-wide. These attributes, which relate to plant litter (origin, incorporation, cover), and surface stability, are relatively cheap and easy to assess with minimal training, allowing operators to sample many sites across widely varying climatic areas and soil types. The correlations of these variables are comparable to the influence of climate or soil, and would allow cost-effective monitoring of soil multifunctionality under changing land-use and environmental conditions. This would provide important information for evaluating the ecological impacts of land degradation, desertification and climate change in drylands world-wide.

Grazing-Induced Changes to Biological Soil Crust Cover Mediate Hillslope Erosion in Long-Term Exclosure Experiment	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Dryland ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to erosion generated by livestock grazing. Quantifying this risk across a variety of landscape settings is essential for successful adaptive management, particularly in light of a changing climate. In the Upper Colorado River Basin, there are nearly 25 000 km(2) of rangelands with underlying soils derived from Mancos Shale, an erodible and saline geologic parent material. Salinity is a major concern within the Colorado River watershed, much of which is attributed to runoff and leaching from Mancos Shale deposits. In a 60-yr paired-watershed experiment in western Colorado, we used silt fences to measure differences in saline hillslope erosion, including both total sediment yield and concentrations of primary saline constituents (Na and Se), in watersheds that were either exposed to grazing or where livestock was excluded. After accounting for the strong effects of soil type, slope, and antecedent precipitation, we found that grazing increased sediment loss byz50% across our 8-yr time series (0.1-1.5 tn ha(-1)), consistent with levels reported at the watershed scale in early published work from studies at the same location. Eroded sediment Se levels were low and unaffected by grazing history, but Na concentrations were significantly reduced on grazed hillslopes, likely due to depletion of surface Na in soils exposed to chronic soil disturbance by livestock. Variable selection and path analysis identified that biological soil crust (BSC) cover, more than any other variable, explained the differences in sediment yields between grazed and ungrazed watersheds, partially through the enhancement of soil aggregate stability. Our results suggest that BSC cover should be granted heightened consideration in rangeland decision support tools (e.g., state-and-transition models) and that measures to reduce surface disturbance from livestock such as altering the timing or intensity of grazing may be effective for reducing downstream impacts.

Modelling maize grain yield and nitrate leaching from sludge-amended soils across agro-ecological zones: A case study from South Africa	WATER SA												When applying municipal sludge according to crop N requirements, the primary aim should be optimizing sludge application rates in order to maximize crop yield and minimize environmental impacts through nitrate leaching. Nitrate leaching and subsequent groundwater contamination is potentially one of the most important factors limiting the long-term viability of sludge application to agricultural soils. This study assessed maize grain yield and potential nitrate leaching from sludge-amended soils, using the SWB-Sci model, based on crop nitrogen requirements and inorganic fertilizer. The following hypotheses were tested using the SWB-Sci model and 20 years of measured weather data for 4 of the 6 South African agro-ecological zones. Under dryland maize cropping, grain yield and nitrate leaching from sludge-amended soils compared to inorganic fertilizer: (1) will remain the same across agro-ecological zones and sites, (2) will not vary across seasons at a specific site, and (3) will not vary across soil textures. Model simulations showed that annual maize grain yield and nitrate leaching varied significantly (P > 0.05) across the four agro-ecological zones, both for sludge-amended and inorganic fertilizer amended soils. The annual maize grain yield and nitrate leaching from sludge-amended soils were 12.6 t.ha(-1) and 32.7 kgNO(3)-N.ha(-1) compared to 10.2 t.ha(-1) and 43.2kgNO(3)-N.ha(-1) for inorganic fertilizer in the super-humid zone. Similarly, maize grain yield and nitrate leaching varied significantly across seasons and soil textures for both sludge and inorganic fertilizer amended soils. However, nitrate losses were lower from sludge-amended soils (2.3-8.2%) compared to inorganic fertilizer (11.1-26.7%) across all zones in South Africa. Therefore, sludge applied according to crop N requirements has a lower environmental impact from nitrate leaching than commercial inorganic fertilizer. Further validation of these findings is recommended, using field studies, and monitoring potential P accumulation for soils that received sludge according to crop N requirements.

In the present study, a pot experiment was conducted to investigate the beneficial effects of dark septate endophytes (DSE) (Acrocalymma aquatica and Alternaria alstroemeriae) combine with organic residues from sterilized or nonsterilized fermented corn straw by Trichoderma afroharzianum on the growth and drought resistance of Isatis indigotica. Drought stress (30% field water capacity) reduced the shoot biomass, root biomass, and epigoitrin content of I. indigotica by 34.30%, 80.85%, and 16.51%, respectively. The DSE inoculation alone increased shoot biomass and epigoitrin content under well-watered condition (70% field water capacity) by 13.75%- 65.98% and 52.33%- 67.59%, respectively, and shoot biomass under drought stress by 37.27%- 84.91%. The organic residues application alone increased root biomass under well-watered condition and drought stress by 71.88%107.06% and 463.61%- 678.69%, respectively. The mixed application of DSE and organic residues increased root biomass and epigoitrin content under well-watered condition by 66.79%- 144.66% and 89.02%- 136.63%, respectively, and under drought stress by 410.66%- 580.49% and 28.26%- 88.37%, respectively. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that DSE inoculation, organic residue application, and the mixed application improved the growth of I. indigotica under drought stress through different direct and indirect pathways. Variation partitioning showed that DSE was the primary factor improving the epigoitrin content, and organic residue was the primary factor influencing plant biomass and morphological parameters. The mixed application of DSE and organic residue had further synergistic effects on soil enzyme activities, soil organic matter, root biomass, and epigoitrin content, especially the mixed application of A. aquatica and sterilized organic residue. These results contribute to a further understanding of the ecological function of DSE in dryland soils and reveal the synergistic application value of DSE and organic residue for medicinal plant cultivation.																			0926-6690	1872-633X				NOV 1	2023	203								117147	10.1016/j.indcrop.2023.117147	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2023.117147		JUL 2023											WOS:001048672000001

However, long-term tillage and N management interaction effects on winter wheat nutrient uptake are not well known. The objective of this study was to quantify winter wheat grain yield, macronutrient removal, and utilization responses to N fertilizer application and tillage intensity. The study was conducted in 2019 and 2020 at Hays, Kansas after 45 years of tillage and N fertility experiment. Treatments were a combination of two tillage practices (CT, conventional tillage; NT) and four rates of N (0, 45, 90, and 134 kg ha(-1)). Results showed a significant tillage and N fertilizer interaction effect on wheat grain yield, nutrient removal (NR) (grain-N, -P, -K, -Mg; stover-K, and total P), and nutrient concentration (stover-K and -S). Two different quadratic models fit the N rate-to-yield relation for CT and NT with yields of 4.3 and 5.2 Mg ha(-1) at agronomic optimal N rates of 119 and 199 kg N ha(-1), respectively. This suggests that the N rates were not high enough to predict optimum N rate for NT in this environment. With an average yield of 3.30 Mg ha(-1), wheat removed about 113 kg N ha(-1), 17 kg P ha(-1), 56 kg K ha(-1), 7 kg Ca ha(-1), 8 kg Mg ha(-1), and 8 kg S ha(-1), irrespective of tillage practice. Grain yields and NR were greater for CT at smaller N rates (<90 kg N ha(-1)) and for NT at greater N rates (>90 kg ha(-1)). Findings of the study suggest that adequate N fertility (>90 kg ha(-1)) should be maintained to improve grain yield, nutrient uptake, and utilization efficiency in dryland NT wheat production systems.

J	Bai, R; Shi, Y; Pan, Y				Bai, Rui; Shi, Ying; Pan, Ying			Land-Use Classifying and Identification of the Production-Living-Ecological Space of Island Villages-A Case Study of Islands in the Western Sea Area of Guangdong Province	LAND												Accurately identifying the rural production-living-ecological space (PLES) of different islands can help reveal their distinct natural resources and land-use situations, which is significant for the sorted management, subarea utilization, and protection of islands. At present, studies on the PLES of island villages are deficient. For instance, the existing land-use classification system is incomplete; the PLES is poorly identified; and the dominant function of multiple land-use types based on different island geomorphology types is insufficiently investigated. Therefore, a case study was conducted on the island villages of the western sea area of Guangdong Province, based on remote sensing, spatial analysis, and land classification, with field research and the relevant data. In this study, before establishing the PLES system, the islands were classified, including six bedrock islands, 10 sedimentary islands, and one volcanic island. When the PLES system of the island villages was classified, the ecological and utilized areas of the intertidal zone and neritic region should be combined with the island-continent part, and the distinct industrial types should be emphasized, before forming 22 secondary types of PLES. Furthermore, it is found that each island generally has its own dominant space and land-use type. Ecological space (ES) dominates the bedrock islands, and production space (PS) is prominent for sedimentary islands and volcanic islands. Forestland, aquaculture pond, and dryland are the prominent land-use types for bedrock islands, sedimentary islands, and volcanic islands, respectively. The rural residential lands are the main component of living space (LS) in all islands, and the most urban residential lands are distributed on the bedrock islands. The main driving factors for the formation and distribution of island rural PLES are the altitudinal gradient and geomorphic characteristics. The research shows that the main problems of PLES are that the intertidal zones are threatened by aquaculture ponds at various levels, and the development of LS in these islands is generally backward.																				2073-445X				MAY	2022	11	5							705	10.3390/land11050705	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11050705													WOS:000803572200001

Louis			The synergy between water conservation and economic profitability of adopting alternative irrigation systems for cotton production in the Texas High Plains	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Declining water levels of the Ogallala Aquifer challenge economic availability of the groundwater and necessitate adoption of advanced irrigation systems with efficient irrigation strategies. Irrigation methods and application levels affect water productivity and farm profitability. This study evaluated the synergy between water conservation through a deficit irrigation strategy and economic profitability of agricultural production. The economic feasibility of cotton production was compared using field data for mid-and low-elevation spray application (MESA and LESA, respectively), low-energy precision application (LEPA), and subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) systems in the Texas High Plains (THP) region. Treatments included irrigated cotton with water application at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% evapotranspiration (ET) replacement levels and near-dryland cotton production. Both field-level data and well-calibrated model simulation data were used to assess cotton profitability at varying risk attitudes of producers. Results showed that more irrigation water consistently increased average net return of cotton production for all irrigation systems, except for SDI, which produced a similar net return at both 75% and 100% ET replacement levels. A larger chance of getting a net return greater than $380 ha-1 was observed for MESA, LESA and LEPA systems with the full irrigation at the 100% ET replacement level as well as for SDI with 75% ET replacement. Economic risk analysis showed that LEPA had a higher net return than other systems at each of the four irrigation levels and it would be preferred by risk-neutral, somewhat risk averse, and rather risk-averse cotton producers. For each irrigation system, full irrigation was most preferred by risk-neutral producers and only minor differences were observed in the expected returns between 75% and 100% ET replacements as the producers became somewhat or more risk-averse. Groundwater conservation can be achieved with SDI without compromising crop yield or farm income, while government policies and financial incentives can help motivate producers to save irrigation water and maintain a high farm profit under spray and LEPA systems.

However, it can also have negative effects on the hydrological cycle and water budget, and thus on water security in dryland regions depending on the afforestation strategy used. Currently, the effects of different afforestation strategies on soil moisture dynamics, evapotranspiration (ET), and water budget at the stand scale are unclear. In this study, we investigated the water budget in two poplar stands, one planted using a low-coverage-mode shelterbelt (LCMS) strategy and the other planted using a conventional strategy (control). Deep drainage (DP), as an indicator of water budget, was estimated using a Hydrus-1D model calibrated with the observed soil moisture at different soil depths (across 0-200 cm) during the growing seasons in 2016, 2017, and 2019. The average DP in the LCMS stand was 107.0-149.6 mm, accounting for 36.5-42.4% of the rainfall occurring during the growing seasons, which was slightly higher than that in the control stand containing younger trees at a higher density. However, DP was more spatially heterogenous in the LCMS stand compared with in the control stand. Specifically, in the LCMS stand, the inter-canopy DP was 195.3-237.5 mm, accounting for 66.6-69.7% of the rainfall, whereas the under-canopy DP was only 18.7-65.0 mm, accounting for 6.4-18.4% of the rainfall during the corresponding period. Structural equation modeling indicated that, on a daily scale, soil moisture had the greatest effect on DP, followed by precipitation and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity. Other climate factors (global radiation, air temperature, vapor pressure deficit and wind speed) and vegetation structure parameters (leaf area index and rooting depth) affected ET, which had a significantly negative relationship with DP. These results help explain the effects of plantation strategy on the water budget, with important implications for artificial forest management, ecological restoration, and protection of local water resources in water-limited environments.

Given the increasing availability of time-series remotely sensed data for earth monitoring, there has been increased recognition of the importance of accounting for both LCC and LCM to study annual land-cover changes. In this study, we integrated 1,513 time-series Landsat images and a change-updating method to identify annual LCC and LCM during 1986-2015 in the coastal area of Zhejiang Province, China. The purpose was to quantify their contributions to land-cover changes and impacts on the amount of vegetation. The results show that LCC and LCM can be successfully distinguished with an overall accuracy of 90.0%. LCM accounted for 22% and 40.5% of the detected land-cover changes in reclaimed and inland areas, respectively, during 1986-2015. In the reclaimed area, LCC occurred mostly in muddy tidal flats, construction land, aquaculture ponds, and freshwater herbaceous land, whereas LCM occurred mostly in freshwater herbaceous land, Spartina alterniflora, and muddy tidal flats. In the inland area, both LCC and LCM were concentrated in forest and dryland. Overall, LCC had a mean magnitude of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) change similar to that of LCM. However, LCC had a positive effect and LCM had a negative effect on NDVI change in the reclaimed area. Both LCC and LCM in the inland area had negative impacts on vegetation greenness, but LCC resulted in larger NDVI change magnitude. Impacts of LCC and LCM on vegetation greenness were quantified for each land-cover type. This study provided a methodological framework to take both LCC and LCM into account when analyzing land-cover changes and quantified their effects on coastal ecosystem vegetation.

Early exposure to UV radiation overshadowed by precipitation and litter quality as drivers of decomposition in the northern Chihuahuan Desert	PLOS ONE												Dryland ecosystems cover nearly 45% of the Earth's land area and account for large proportions of terrestrial net primary production and carbon pools. However, predicting rates of plant litter decomposition in these vast ecosystems has proven challenging due to their distinctly dry and often hot climate regimes, and potentially unique physical drivers of decomposition. In this study, we elucidated the role of photopriming, i.e. exposure of standing dead leaf litter to solar radiation prior to litter drop that would chemically change litter and enhance biotic decay of fallen litter. We exposed litter substrates to three different UV radiation treatments simulating three-months of UV radiation exposure in southern New Mexico: no light, UVA+UVB+Visible, and UVA+Visible. There were three litter types: mesquite leaflets (Prosopis glandulosa, litter with high nitrogen (N) concentration), filter paper (pure cellulose), and basswood (Tilia spp, high lignin concentration). We deployed the photoprimed litter in the field within a large scale precipitation manipulation experiment: similar to 50% precipitation reduction, similar to 150% precipitation addition, and ambient control. Our results revealed the importance of litter substrate, particularly N content, for overall decomposition in drylands, as neither filter paper nor basswood exhibited measurable mass loss over the course of the year-long study, while high N-containing mesquite litter exhibited potential mass loss. We saw no effect of photopriming on subsequent microbial decay. We did observe a precipitation effect on mesquite where the rate of decay was more rapid in ambient and precipitation addition treatments than in the drought treatment. Overall, we found that precipitation and N played a critical role in litter mass loss. In contrast, photopriming had no detected effects on mass loss over the course of our year-long study. These results underpin the importance of biotic-driven decomposition, even in the presence of photopriming, for understanding litter decomposition and biogeochemical cycles in drylands.

J	Zhou, H; Li, L; Liu, YX				Zhou, Hong; Li, Lun; Liu, Yunxiang			Biological soil crust development affects bacterial communities in the <i>Caragana microphylla</i> community in alpine sandy areas	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												IntroductionBiological soil crusts (BSCs) constitute a substantial portion of primary production in dryland ecosystems. They successionally mature to deliver a series of ecosystem services. Bacteria, as an important community in BSCs, play critical roles in maintaining the structure and functions of BSCs. However, the process by which bacterial diversity and community are altered with BSC development is not fully understood. MethodsIn this study, amplicons sequencing was used to investigate bacterial diversity and community compositions across five developmental stages of BSCs (bare sand, microbial crusts, algae crusts, lichen crusts, and moss crusts) and their relationship with environmental variables in the Gonghe basin sandy land in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, northwestern China. ResultsThe results showed that Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes were predominant in different developmental stages of BSCs, accounting for more than 77% of the total relative abundance. The phyla of Acidobacteria and Bacteroidetes were abundant in this region. With BSC development, bacterial diversity significantly increased, and the taxonomic community composition significantly altered. The relative abundance of copiotrophic bacteria, such as Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Planctomycetes, and Gemmatimonadetes significantly increased, whereas the relative abundance of oligotrophic bacteria, such as Proteobacteria and Firmicutes significantly decreased. The relative abundance of Cyanobacteria in the algae crusts was significantly higher than that in the other developmental stages (p < 0.05). ConclusionVariations in bacterial composition suggested that the potential ecological functions of the bacterial community were altered with BSC development. The functions varied from enhancing soil surface stability by promoting soil particle cementation in the early stages to promoting material circulation of the ecosystem by fixing carbon and nitrogen and decomposing litter in the later stages of BSC development. Bacterial community is a sensitive index of water and nutrient alterations during BSC development. SWC, pH value, TC, TOC, TN, NO3-, TP and soil texture were the primary environmental variables that promoted changes in the bacterial community composition of BSCs.																				1664-302X				MAR 15	2023	14								1106739	10.3389/fmicb.2023.1106739	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1106739								37007529					WOS:000955005300001

In the present investigation, A.formosense and Bacillus spp. strains showing diverse PGP traits (IAA production, nitrogenase activity, phosphate, zinc and potassium solubilization, siderophores, antagonism against phytopathogens, osmotic stress tolerance, etc.) were assessed for compatibility by cross-streaking and co-culturing. Under co-culture (Azospirillum + Bacillus), a significant increase in the expression of PGP traits, nitrogenase activity (up to 89%), phosphate solubilization (upto 236%), siderophore production (upto 20%) was observed as compared to individual Azospirillum culture, indicating synergistic effect of co-culture. IAA production was higher in Azospirillum sp. strains as compared to Bacillus spp. strains, when cultured individually; however, when co-cultured, the IAA levels were in the mid-range indicating the contributory effects of compatible strains. The effect of individual Azospirillum and Bacillus strains and their co-inoculation was also assessed on the growth of pearl millet at early stages under moisture-deficit stress imposed using PEG6000 (0, 10, and 20%). Co-inoculation enhanced seed germination (up to 10, 3, and 6% increase under 0, 10, and 20% PEG, respectively, over individual Azospirillum treatment), root traits (increased root hair density and lateral branches), and seedling vigor indices (up to 22, 32, 43% increase in seed vigor index I and 8, 14, and 10% increase in seed vigor index II under 0, 10, 20% PEG, respectively, over individual Azospirillum treatment) under normal as well as moisture-deficit conditions suggesting the role of Bacillus spp. strains in better adaptation of the plants to stress and higher yield potential. The synergistic effect of co-cultured Azospirillum and Bacillus strains on PGP traits indicated metabolic interplay between the two strains which needs to be further understood. The positive effect of co-inoculation on plant growth under moisture-deficit stress indicated the promise of Azospirillum and Bacillus as a synergistic bioformulation for combating nutrient and drought stress in pearl millet, particularly in nutrient-poor dryland agricultural systems.

Remote-sensing technology provides a rapid and accurate assessment for soil salinity monitoring, but there is a lack of high-resolution remote-sensing spatial salinity estimations. The PlanetScope satellite array provides high-precision mapping for land surface monitoring through its 3-m spatial resolution and near-daily revisiting frequency. This study's use of the PlanetScope satellite array is a new attempt to estimate soil salinity in inland drylands. We hypothesized that field observations, PlanetScope data, and spectral indices derived from the PlanetScope data using the partial least-squares regression (PLSR) method would produce reasonably accurate regional salinity maps based on 84 ground-truth soil salinity data and various spectral parameters, like satellite band reflectance, and published satellite salinity indices. The results showed that using the newly constructed red-edge salinity and yellow band salinity indices, we were able to develop several inversion models to produce regional salinity maps. Different algorithms, including Boruta feature preference, Random Forest algorithm (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGBoost), were applied for variable selection. The newly constructed yellow salinity indices (YRNDSI and YRNDVI) had the best Pearson correlations of 0.78 and -0.78. We also found that the proportions of the newly constructed yellow and red-edge bands accounted for a large proportion of the essential strategies of the three algorithms, with Boruta feature preference at 80%, RF at 80%, and XGBoost at 60%, indicating that these two band indices contributed more to the soil salinity estimation results. The best PLSR model estimation for different strategies is the XGBoost-PLSR model with coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) values of 0.832, 12.050, and 2.442, respectively. These results suggest that PlanetScope data has the potential to significantly advance the field of soil salinity research by providing a wealth of fine-scale salinity information.

Fertilizer application and straw management affect crop K uptake and soil K changes, but their effects and mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Three long-term site-fixed field experiments were conducted in K-rich soils to understand crop yield, plant K utilization, and soil K changes in response to N fertilizer rates, P fertilizer rates, and straw management in dryland winter wheat mono-cropping systems. Results showed that grain yield and grain K uptake increased by 28-43% and 17-28% at different N rates, increased by 38-64% and 35-80% at different P rates, but decreased by 17% and 16% with straw return, respectively. Grain K concentration decreased by 9-15% in applying N fertilizers, increased by 6-9% in applying P fertilizers, and showed no difference between control (straw removal) and straw return. Although straw was returned to the field in all three experiments, soil K depletion was observed with annual decline rate and deficit index of 0.8-1.8 mg kg yr(-1) and 0.5-0.8 kg K t(-1) for soil available K, and 9.7-16.9 mg kg yr(-1) and 5.0-12.6 kg K t(-1) for slowly available K, respectively. This means that straw return is insufficient to prevent soil K depletion, and supplying K fertilizer is needed. Farmer's survey findings showed that the mean K fertilizer rate in the experimental area was 31-34 kg K2O ha(-1). The current K fertilizer rate could maintain an apparent K balance if all wheat straws were returned to the field, but here the straw-returning rate was only 20-25%. Improving the straw-returning rate and managing K fertilizer rationally will be a crucial strategy for sustainable wheat production.																			1161-0301	1873-7331				FEB	2023	143								126728	10.1016/j.eja.2022.126728	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2022.126728		DEC 2022											WOS:000907027700001

L.; Leal, Inara R.; Tabarelli, Marcelo			Cross-scale drivers of woody plant species commonness and rarity in the Brazilian drylands	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim Locally abundant species are typically widespread, while locally scarce species are geographically restricted-the so-called abundance-occupancy relationships (AORs). AORs help explain the drivers of species rarity and community assembly, but little is known about how variation around such relationship is driven by species traits and niche-based processes, particularly in tropical woody plants. We tested the hypothesis that AORs in tropical dryland woody plants are positive and mediated by niche and functional traits along environmental gradients. Location The Caatinga dry forest and Cerrado savannah, Brazil. Methods We aggregated abundance and occurrence data into grid-cells representing local (10-km) to landscape scales (50-km). We calculated species mean relative abundance at occupied grid-cells (local abundance) and the proportion of grid-cells occupied (occupancy), and estimated their niche breadth and marginality along multivariate environmental gradients. Results AORs were positive but weak at different scales in both regions due to some locally abundant but geographically restricted species, with most species being both locally and geographically rare. Cross-species variation in local abundance was largely unpredictable, but occupancy was strongly driven by niche and functional traits, with a prominent negative effect of niche marginality. Geographically restricted species were associated with rare habitats, such as wetter and less intensively used habitats. Large seeds and abiotic dispersal favoured occupancy in Caatinga at small and large spatial scales, respectively, whereas species with conservative leaves were more widespread across scales in Cerrado. Main conclusions Woody plants in dry tropical biotas exhibit weak AORs, a pattern likely related to low habitat availability and dispersal limitation. Caatinga and Cerrado biotas emerge as environmentally structured at multiple spatial scales, with several habitat-specialist rare species bearing specific regenerative and resource-use traits and relying on conditions threatened by climate change and land-use intensification. Examining AORs through the lens of niche, functional traits and spatial scales enables mapping patterns and drivers of species commonness and rarity, enhancing understanding of species assembly and providing tools for biodiversity conservation.

FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Understanding the genetics of metribuzin (a group C herbicide) tolerance in wheat is vital in developing tolerant cultivars to improve wheat productivity in dryland farming systems. This study investigated metribuzin tolerance in wheat by conducting a Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) with a panel of 150 wheat genotypes of diverse genetic backgrounds and genotyped them with the wheat 90 K SNP genotyping assay. The phenotyping was conducted in a temperature-controlled glasshouse at the University of Western Australia (UWA). Genotypes were sprayed with a metribuzin dose of 400 grams of active ingredient (g. a.i.) ha(-1) as pre-emergent in a specialized spraying cabinet and transferred to the glasshouse where the tolerance level of the genotypes was assessed by measuring the relative reduction in chlorophyll content of the leaves. The decrease in chlorophyll content of the treated plants compared to the control was regarded as the phytotoxic effects of metribuzin. GWAS analysis following a mixed linear model revealed 19 genomic regions with significant marker-trait associations (MTAs), including ten on chromosome 6A, three on chromosome 2B, and one on chromosomes 3A, 5B, 6B 6D, 7A, and 7B, respectively. Sequences of the significant markers were blasted against the wheat genome, IWGSC RefSeq V1.0, and candidate genes having annotations related to herbicide tolerance in wheat, especially in pathways reported to be involved in metribuzin tolerance, such as cytochrome P450 pathways and ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamilies, were identified in these genomic regions. These included TraesCS6A01G028800, TraesCS6A02G353700, TraesCS6A01G326200, TraesCS7A02G331000, and TraesCS2B01G465200. These genomic regions were validated on 30 top tolerant and 30 most susceptible genotypes using the five closest SSR makers to the flanked SNPs. Sufficient polymorphism was detected on two markers (wms193 and barc1036) that were found to differentiate between the susceptible and tolerant alleles and a t-test analysis of the phenotypic data shows a significant (value of p < 0.001) difference suggesting that these markers can be used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in metribuzin studies and wheat breeding programs.

J	Song, XT; Wei, HN; Rees, RM; Ju, XT				Song, Xiaotong; Wei, Huanhuan; Rees, Robert M.; Ju, Xiaotang			Soil oxygen depletion and corresponding nitrous oxide production at hot moments in an agricultural soil	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Hot moments of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions induced by interactions between weather and management make a major contribution to annual N2O budgets in agricultural soils. The causes of N2O production during hot moments are not well understood under field conditions, but emerging evidence suggests that short-term fluctuations in soil oxygen (O-2) concentration can be critically important. We conducted high time-resolution field observations of O-2 and N2O concentrations during hot moments in a dryland agricultural soil in Northern China. Three typical management and weather events, including irrigation (Irr.), fertilization coupled with irrigation (Fer.+Irr.) or with extreme precipitation (Fer.+Pre.), were observed. Soil O-2 and N2O concentrations were measured hourly for 24 h immediately following events and measured daily for at least one week before and after the events. Soil moisture, temperature, and mineral N were simultaneously measured. Soil O-2 concentrations decreased rapidly within 4 h following irrigation in both the Irr. and Fer.+Irr. events. In the Fer.+Pre. event, soil O-2 depletion did not occur immediately following fertilization but began following subsequent continuous rainfall. The soil O-2 concentration dropped to as low as 0.2% (with the highest soil N2O concentration of up to 180 ppmv) following the Fer.+Pre. event, but only fell to 11.7% and 13.6% after the Fer.+Irr. and Irr. events, which were associated with soil N2O concentrations of 27 ppmv and 3 ppmv, respectively. During the hot moments of all three events, soil N2O concentrations were negatively correlated with soil O-2 concentrations (r = -0.5, P < 0.01), showing a quadratic increase as soil O-2 concentrations declined. Our results provide new understanding of the rapid short response of N2O production to O-2 dynamics driven by changes in soil environmental factors during hot moments. Such understanding helps improve soil management to avoid transitory O-2 depletion and reduce the risk of N2O production.

The East Nusa Tenggara itself is an eastern region of Indonesia with a unique climate condition called semi-arid. The high rainfall intensity occurring in short duration results in large surface runoff and erosion. Floods and erosion in semi-arid areas due to sensitive soils to drought and heavy rainfall extremely. This paper presents the application of the Soil Conservation Services-Curve Number (SCS-CN) real-flood flows through a digital map of soil type, land use, topography, and the heterogeneity of physical condition, especially for ungauged watersheds. The method used is an approach empirical to estimate runoff from the relationship between rainfall, land use, and soil hydrology groups. This watershed has a large area that must analyze every sub-watershed. The land-use of the Benanain watershed is secondary dryland forest by 44.26% and the hydrological soil group on the B group classification with medium to high absorption potential by 46.502% from the total area. The curve number value of the Benanain Watershed ranges from 56.54 to 73.90, where the mean CN value of 65.32. The rainfall (mm) for the 29 sub-watersheds in the Benanain Watershed has decreased by about 74.65% when being surface runoff or only 25.35% of water becomes surface runoff. The relationship between rainfall depth and CN is classified as standard response and trend line (flat slope) equilibrium occurs when rainfall depth value of 56.71 mm and CN is close to 66.30. The high variability of intense rainfall between the rainy season and the dry season had a significant influence on the curve number value in a large watershed area. Further analysis will be more accurate if it is supported by long rainfall data and observation runoff data as a control.

J	Hou, XQ; Li, R; He, WS; Ma, K				Hou, Xianqing; Li, Rong; He, Wenshou; Ma, Kun			Effects of planting density on potato growth, yield, and water use efficiency during years with variable rainfall on the Loess Plateau, China	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												A 3-yr field study was conducted in semiarid areas of the Loess Plateau to investigate the effects of different planting densities on the soil water, potato growth, yield, and WUE during the normal year (2015), relatively dry year (2016), and relatively wet year (2017). The five potato planting densities were 3.75 x 10(4) (A, traditional local planting density as a control), 4.50 x 10(4) (B), 5.25 x 10(4) (C), 6.00 x 10(4) (D), and 6.75 x 10(4) plants ha(-1) (E). During the three years, the differences in soil water storage among the five planting densities were significant in the early and middle potato growth stages, when the soil water storage levels in treatments B and C were 8.8 % and 10.8 % higher (P < 0.05) than those in A. Treatments B and C significantly (P < 0.05) increased the potato emergence rate by 12.5 % and 7.5 % to promote growth in the early and middle stages. The planting density had a decreasing parabolic relationship with the potato yield. After fitting a function to the three years of data, the highest tuber potato yield varied with the amount of rainfall and the optimum level was 5.12-5.58 x 10(4) plants ha(-1). The WUE and rainwater use efficiency (RWUE) were significantly higher under B and C compared with A in the normal and relatively dry years. WUE and RWUE were significantly higher in B, C, and D compared with A in the relatively wet year. The optimum planting density with treatments B and C obtained higher net profits. Thus, the recommended optimum planting density should be 4.50-5.12 x 10(4) plants ha(-1) in relatively dry years and 5.13-5.58 x 10(4) plants ha(-1) in normal and relatively wet years to increase dryland potato production and water use efficiency in the semiarid regions of the Loess Plateau, China.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				MAR 1	2020	230								105982	10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105982	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105982													WOS:000525283000024
J	Simtowe, F; Mausch, K				Simtowe, Franklin; Mausch, Kai			Who is quitting? An analysis of the dis-adoption of climate smart sorghum varieties in Tanzania	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT												Purpose - New agricultural technologies are continuously generated and promoted for adoption by farmers with the expectation that they bring about higher benefits than older technologies. Yet, depending on the perceived benefits, the user of the technology may choose to stop using it. This paper aims to analyze what drives farmers to dis-adopt climate smart sorghum varieties in Tanzania. Design/methodology/approach - The study uses cross-sectional farm household level data collected in Tanzania from a sample of 767 households. The determinants of dis-adoption are explored using a bivariate probit with sample selection model. Findings - The authors find that while farmers switch between different sorghum varieties, most farmers actually quit sorghum production. Older farmers and those facing biotic stresses such attacks by birds are more likely to dis-adopt sorghum. Practical implications - These findings suggest that there is scope for improving and sustaining the adoption of sorghum varieties in Tanzania once extension services are strengthened. The findings also point to a well-founded theory on the role of markets in enhancing the overall sustainability of food systems. Social implications - The study findings have broader implications for understanding the sustainability of improved technology adoption Originality/value - Dis-adoption is also positively associated with the lack of access to markets underscoring the role of markets in enhancing the overall sustainability of technology adoption and food systems.

J	Edet, OU; Ishii, T				Edet, Offiong Ukpong; Ishii, Takayoshi			Cowpea speed breeding using regulated growth chamber conditions and seeds of oven-dried immature pods potentially accommodates eight generations per year	PLANT METHODS												Background Cowpea is a dryland crop with potential to improve food security in sub-Saharan Africa, where it is mostly produced and consumed. Contemporary plant improvement technologies, including genome editing, marker-assisted selection, and optimized transformation protocols, are being deployed to improve cowpea characteristics. Integrating speed breeding with these technologies would accelerate genetic gain in cowpea breeding. There are established speed breeding protocols for other important legumes, such as soybean, peanut, and chickpea, but none has been previously reported for cowpea. Results With the aid of regulated growth conditions in two different chamber types, as well as the cultivation of new plant generations from seeds of oven-dried immature pods, we developed and validated, for the first time, an efficient speed breeding protocol that accommodates approximately seven to eight breeding generations per year for 3 cowpea genotypes. The 3 cowpea genotypes were evaluated under controlled growth conditions in light-emitting diode and metal halide lamp chambers to determine the effect of CO2 supplementation on flowering and maturation durations, optimum conditions for plant growth, cross pollination, and pod development. Elevated CO2 concentration had no influence on either flowering time or pod development. Adequate temperature, relative humidity and light intensity improved plant development and the rate of successful hand pollination, and cultivating seeds of 11-day-old immature pods oven-dried at 39 degrees C for 2 days resulted in at least a 62% reduction in the time between pollination and sowing of the next plant generation. The plants cultivated from seeds of the oven-dried immature pods showed no defect at any stage of development. Conclusions Using the speed breeding protocol developed in this study, cowpea breeding cycles can be increased from the traditional one cycle per year in the field to as many as 8 generations per year in regulated growth chamber conditions. This protocol has no special technical requirements; hence, it can be implemented in any standard growth chamber. This would fast-track development, testing, validation, and utilization of improved cowpea cultivars.					; Ishii, Takayoshi/C-4038-2019	Edet, Offiong/0000-0001-7824-4898; Ishii, Takayoshi/0000-0001-6370-3289														1746-4811				AUG 29	2022	18	1							106	10.1186/s13007-022-00938-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13007-022-00938-3								36031612					WOS:000846781700001

Based on the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), this study presents a framework to quantify drought changes in an attribution study, and quantifies the effects of climate factors, LUCC, and other human activities on drought in a typical basin (Yihe River) in eastern China from 1980 to 2019. (1) The SWAT-PDSI results revealed a slight decreasing trend from 1980 to 2019, indicating that the degree of drought increased-especially in the middle of the basin. (2) The precipitation in the basin exhibited a downward trend (-2.7 mm/10 a), while the temperature exhibited a significant increasing trend (0.13 degrees C/10 a, p < 0.05). Over the past 40 years, LUCC in the Yihe River Basin was mainly characterized by a reduction in the dryland area (149 km(2)) and an increase in the built-up area (135 km(2)), which changed by -1.77% and 18.96%, respectively. (3) Climate fluctuation was the main driving factor of drought change, with a contribution rate ranging from 68 to 84%, and the contribution to drought gradually increased. Among the various factors, the contribution of temperature exceeded that of precipitation from 2010 to 2019, suggesting that temperature has become the most important climate factor affecting drought. The contribution rates of LUCC to drought changes over the periods 1990-1999, 2000-2009, and 2010-2019 were 7.8%, 18%, and 12.6%, respectively. This indicates that the relative contributions of other human activities to drought changes gradually decreased. This study refines the drought attribution framework, which could provide scientific support for the quantitative attribution of drought and the formulation of disaster prevention and reduction strategies.

Stratigraphic and palaeoclimatic studies of this area are difficult due to the influence of several factors, such as a complex history of regional tectonic activities, as well as climatic changes coupled with dryland diagenetic processes. This lake, in the central Kalahari, is the key to understanding the climatic variability in the southern part of Africa in the Quaternary and has played an important role in the evolution of numerous taxa, including our own. In this study, detailed sedimentological analyses (grain size and major elements distribution) of shallow sediments from the Makgadikgadi Pans were combined with the first comprehensive study of the encountered ostracod fauna to establish trends in the environmental changes in the area from the late Quaternary. Ostracod fossil assemblages from the cores of the Makgadikgadi Pans are dominated by the Limnocythere ssp., an opportunistic taxa commonly colonizing the littoral areas of shallow evaporative, ephemeral lakes, together with the subordinate occurrences of Sarcypridopsis ochracea, Sclerocypris cf. bicornis, Candonopsis spp., and Ilyocypris spp. The sediments from the pans show fluctuations in the Cl/K and Ca/Cl ratios, often in phase with the relative abundance of Limnocythere suggesting a cyclicity induced by changes of salinity and alkalinity in the water. This multi-proxy study of the cores collected from the pans suggests a Late Pleistocene shallow, playa lake environment with strongly alkaline water, interrupted by a prolonged drought with sustained aeolian conditions between similar to 16 and 2 ka BP. Increasing diversity of ostracod fauna in the top 20-30 cm of the cores indicates that a temporary shift toward higher humidity occurred around 2-1.5 ka BP and lasted through the Medieval Warm Period. This humid period was followed by an overall desiccation trend that started with the Little Ice Age and continues until the present day.

Benefits and Limitations to Plastic Mulching and Nitrogen Fertilization on Grain Yield and Sulfur Nutrition: Multi-Site Field Trials in the Semiarid Area of China	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Plastic mulching (PM) is widely used to improve crop water use efficiency and grain yield, but few studies have reported the effects of PM on cereal crop quality, especially sulfur (S) nutrition of wheat, which has significant effects on grain protein content, dough rheology, baking quality and human health. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a multi-site field experiment on the Loess Plateau from 2014 to 2016 to study the effects of PM combined with nitrogen (N) fertilizer on grain yield, shoot S accumulation, and grain S concentration of winter wheat in dryland. Compared with no mulching (NM), PM increased grain yield by 13.7% but decreased grain S concentration, S requirement for 1,000 kg(-1) grain, soil available S concentration, and post-anthesis S uptake by 9.0, 9.7, 24.4, and 51.8%, respectively. Plastic mulching significantly increased shoot S accumulation at anthesis by 19.2%, but there was no significant difference at maturity. Additionally, grain S concentration and S requirement had a linear-plateau relationship with N fertilization amount, reaching maximum values at 110 and 127 kg N ha(-1) under PM, 37.5 and 27.0% higher than those under NM. Furthermore, shoot S accumulation and N application rates well-fitted the linear-plateau model at anthesis and maturity. At maturity, straw, grain, and shoots accumulated the most S at threshold N rates of 120, 85 and 110 kg N ha(-1), respectively. Crucially, stem + leaf S concentration at anthesis had a significant linear relationship with grain S concentration under PM; a 1 g kg(-1) increase in stem leaf concentration corresponded with a 0.24 g kg(-1) increase in grain S concentration. This study's findings suggest that combining soil S supplementation with optimal N fertilizer under PM in northwest China and other regions with similar cropping systems increases grain S concentration and improves nutritional and processing qualities.

BMC PLANT BIOLOGY												Background: Herbicide tolerance is an important trait that allows effective weed management in wheat crops in dryland farming. Genetic knowledge of metribuzin tolerance in wheat is needed to develop new cultivars for the industry. Here, we investigated gene effects for metribuzin tolerance in nine crosses of wheat by partitioning the means and variances of six basic generations from each cross into their genetic components to assess the gene action governing the inheritance of this trait. Metribuzin tolerance was measured by a visual senescence score 21 days after treatment. The wheat 90 K iSelect SNP genotyping assay was used to identify the distribution of alleles at SNP sites in tolerant and susceptible groups. Results: The scaling and joint-scaling tests indicated that the inheritance of metribuzin tolerance in wheat was adequately described by the additive-dominance model, with additive gene action the most significant factor for tolerance. The potence ratio for all the crosses ranged between - 1 and + 1 for senescence under metribuzin-treated conditions indicating a semi-dominant gene action in the inheritance of metribuzin tolerance in wheat. The number of segregating genes governing metribuzin tolerance was estimated between 3 and 15. The consistent high heritability range (0.82 to 0.92) in F5-7 generations of Chuan Mai 25 (tolerant) x Ritchie (susceptible) cross indicated a significant contribution of additive genetic effects to metribuzin tolerance in wheat. Several genes related to photosynthesis (e.g. photosynthesis system II assembly factor YCF48), metabolic detoxification of xenobiotics and cell growth and development (cytochrome P450, glutathione S-transferase, glycosyltransferase, ATP-binding cassette transporters and glutathione peroxidase) were identified on different chromosomes (2A, 2D, 3B, 4A, 4B, 7A, 7B, 7D) governing metribuzin tolerance. Conclusions: The simple additive-dominance gene effects for metribuzin tolerance will help breeders to select tolerant lines in early generations and the identified genes may guide the development of functional markers for metribuzin tolerance.

J	Le Maitre, D; Görgens, A; Howard, G; Walker, N				Le Maitre, David; Gorgens, Andre; Howard, Gerald; Walker, Nick			Impacts of alien plant invasions on water resources and yields from the Western Cape Water Supply System (WCWSS)	WATER SA												A key motivation for managing invasive alien plant (IAP) species is their impacts on streamflows, which, tor the wetter half of South Africa, are about 970 m(3).ha(-1).a(-1) or 1 444 mill.m(3).a(-1) (2.9% of naturalised mean annual runoff), comparable to forest plantations. However, the implications of these reductions for the reliability of yields from large water supply systems are less well known. The impacts on yields from the WCWSS were modelled under three invasion scenarios: 'Baseline' invasions; increased invasions by 2045 under 'No management; and under 'Effective control' (i.e. minimal invasions). Monthly streamflow reductions (SFRs) by invasions were simulated using the Pitman rainfall-runoff catchment model, with taxonspeci tic mean annual and low-flow SFR factors for dryland (upland) invasions and crop factors for riparian invasions. These streamflow reduction sequences were input into the WCWSS yield model and the model was run in stochastic mode for the three scenarios. The 98% assured total system yields were predicted to be +/- 580 million m(3).a(-1) under 'Effective control', compared with +/- 542 million niLa under 'Baseline' invasions and +/- 450 mill. m(3).a(-1) in 45 years' time with 'No management'. The 'Baseline' invasions already reduce the yield by 38 mill.m(3).a(-1) (two thirds of the capacity of the Wemmershoek Dam) and, in 45 years' time with no clearing, the reductions would increase to 130 mill. m(3).a(-1) (capacity of the Berg River Dam). Therefore I A P-related SFRs can have significant impacts on the yields of large, complex water supply systems. A key reason for this substantial impact on yields is that all the catchments in the WCWSS are invaded, and the invasions are increasing. Invasions also will cost more to clear in the future. So, the best option for all the water-users in the WCWSS is a combined effort to clear the catchments and protect their least expensive source of water.

However, how these inputs impact soil greenhouse gas emissions is unknown. This study aimed to measure the amount of greenhouse gas emissions and pH after the application of various doses of elemental sulfur (ES) and sulfuric acid (SA). Using static chambers, this study quantifies soil greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, N2O, and CH4) for 12 months after the application of ES (200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 kg ha(-1)) and SA (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 kg ha(-1)) to a calcareous soil (pH 8.1) in Zanjan, Iran. Also, in order to simulate rainfed and dryland farming which are common practices in this area, this study was conducted with and without sprinkler irrigation. Application of ES slowly decreased soil pH (more than half a unit) over the year whereas application of SA temporarily reduced the pH (less than a half unit) for a few weeks. CO2 and N2O emissions and CH4 uptake were maximum during summer and lowest in winter. Cumulative CO2 fluxes ranged from 1859.2 kg(-1) CO2-C ha(-1) year(-1) in the control treatment to 2269.6 kg CO2-C ha(-1) year(-1) in the 1000 kg ha(-1) ES treatment. Cumulative fluxes for N2O-N were 2.5 and 3.7 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1) and cumulative CH4 uptakes were 0.2 and 2.3 kg CH4-C ha(-1) year(-1) in the same treatments. Irrigation significantly increased CO2 and N2O emissions and, depending on the amount of ES applied, decreased or increased CH4 uptake. SA application had a negligible effect on GHGs emissions in this experiment and only the highest amount of SA altered GHGs emissions.

Gray) Cultivars	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												Tepary bean is gaining interest around the world as a dryland field crop. A two-year field experiment was conducted to determine the effect of plant spacing on the agronomic performance and fodder quality of the crop. A split-plot design was used with three replications, four cultivars (GK010, GK011, GK012, and Motsumi) were assigned to main plots, while subplots were three intrarow plant spacing (10 cm, 20 cm, and 30 cm). Four agronomic variables and eight chemical compositions, including in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) of husk, stem, and leaf, were measured. Spacing significantly (P < 0.05) influenced plant biomass, pod yield, harvest index, and seed yield, while cultivar affected only pod yield and seed yield. Plant biomass increased with plant spacing where 10 cm produced 936 kg/ha; 20 cm, 750 kg/ha; and 30 cm, 611 kg/ha for 2015-2016 while 10, 20, and 30 cm were observed for 1568 kg/ha, 1135 kg/ha, and 889 kg/ha, respectively, in 2016-2017 season. These trends are attributed to the higher plant population in the narrow row spacing. GK012 consistently outperformed other cultivars for plant biomass, pod yield, and seed yield and has a potential for further selection. Fodder nutritive qualities were not affected by cultivar, while spacing only influenced IVDMD. The three plant parts were significantly (P < 0.05) different for all the nutritive qualities. Leaves had significantly (P < 0.05) lower values of ADF, CF, and NDF compared to those of stem and husk an indication of relatively higher digestibility of the leaf. Acid detergent fiber (40%), neutral detergent fiber (53.65%), crude fiber (35.45%), ash content (12.29%), dry matter (93.09%), and IVDMD (70.66%) were recorded. This study revealed that tepary bean forage has good nutritional content, except for the low phosphorus level. For higher agronomic performance, tepary cultivars should be planted at a spacing of 10 cm without compromising forage quality.																			1687-8159	1687-8167				JAN 19	2022	2022								6590608	10.1155/2022/6590608	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/6590608													WOS:000767522900001
J	Adeleye, MA; Haberle, SG; McWethy, D; Connor, SE; Stevenson, J				Adeleye, Matthew Adesanya; Haberle, Simon Graeme; McWethy, David; Connor, Simon Edward; Stevenson, Janelle			Environmental change during the last glacial on an ancient land bridge of southeast Australia	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim: The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) remains an enigmatic period in southeast Australia due to the limited spatial and temporal resolution of its palaeoclimatic records. A major feature of the LGM landscape was the existence of the Bassian Land Bridge, joining Tasmania with the mainland of Australia during periods of low sea level, and potentially facilitating increased biotic movement between these regions. To better understand biogeographical changes on the land bridge and in southeast Australia generally during the LGM, we present a 35 ka-year palaeoecological record from one of the larger islands of Bass Strait. Location: Bass Strait, southeast Australia. Taxon: Eucalyptus, Poaceae, Monotoca, Myriophyllum, Zygnemataceae, Botryococcus, Pediastrum. Methods: Pollen, charcoal, and non-pollen palynomorphs were analysed in a 1.75-m sediment core from truwana/Cape Barren Island, Bass Strait, to reconstruct changes in vegetation, fire regimes and lake levels on the Bassian Land Bridge. Results were then compared to existing palaeoenvironmental studies in the region to develop a broader context of the prevailing land bridge environment and the potential influence on biotic dispersals in Australia during the last glacial period. Results: Results suggest a major vegetation shift on the Bassian Land Bridge in response to the establishment of the LGM climate, with grassland expansion at the expense of woodland from similar to 29-11 ka. Floristic richness, biomass burned and lake levels also markedly decreased through this period, with the driest interval being similar to 25-18 ka. Dryland herbaceous taxa dispersed between the mainland and Tasmania when the landbridge was fully exposed. Main conclusions: In agreement with previous studies, our results show that the dry grassland that dominated southeast Australia (and Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude areas) during the LGM also extended across the Bassian Land Bridge. The prevailing environment on the land bridge is likely to have exerted a selective influence on biotic dispersals in Australia during glacial periods.

DSE may provide nutrients to their plant hosts and help them adapt to various abiotic and biotic stresses. However, their effects on the microbiome composition in plant rhizosphere need further clarification. Here, we conducted a pot experiment to establish whether the responses of licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis) to DSE (Acrocalymma vagum, Paraboeremia putaminum) inoculation under different water treatments are caused by changes in the rhizosphere microbiome. Rhizosphere microbiome compositions were measured by Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 16S and ITS2 rRNA genes. The inoculation with DSE strains had a positive effect on plant growth of licorice depending on DSE species and water treatments. Subsequently, a total of 1278 fungal and 1583 bacterial operational taxonomic units (OUTs) were obtained at a 97% sequence similarity level. Ascomycota were the predominant fungi and Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and Firmicutes were the predominant bacteria. DSE inoculation and water regime significantly influenced the microbiome composition. However, the effects of DSE on the fungal community were greater than those on the bacterial community. P. putaminum exerted a stronger impact on the licorice rhizosphere microbiome than A. vagum under drought stress. The observed changes in edaphic factors (water condition, soil organic matter, available nitrogen, available phosphorus, and available potassium) caused by DSE inoculation could be explained by the variations in microbiome composition. A network analysis indicated that DSE inoculation augmented the relative abundance of beneficial symbiotrophic fungi and growth-promoting bacteria but diminished the relative abundance of pathogens in the licorice rhizosphere. The present study showed that the licorice rhizosphere microbial community differed between the DSE-inoculated and uninoculated plants. DSE had a stronger influence on the fungal than on the bacterial rhizosphere community under drought stress. These give us the guidance to develop biofertilizers with DSE consortia to enhance the cultivation of medicinal plants by shaping soil microbial community structure and soil nutrient status in dryland agriculture.																			0929-1393	1873-0272				OCT	2021	166								103993	10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.103993	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.103993		MAR 2021											WOS:000679312200018
J	Sternberg, T; McCarthy, C; Hoshino, B				Sternberg, Troy; McCarthy, Chris; Hoshino, Buho			Does China's Belt and Road Initiative Threaten Food Security in Central Asia?	WATER												China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) needs little introduction; the infrastructure investment will reconfigure development in Central Asia. As its origin story and initial encounter, Central Asia offers a prismatic lens to delve into the vital impacts and significant changes wrought by the BRI. In the dryland region, the BRI impact on watersheds and agriculture is a critical challenge with direct implications for food security. Framed by diverse research sources, we utilized spatial datasets from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative and the World Bank to explore the intersection of food production, water and development. Investigation evaluates the possible trade-offs that Chinese infrastructure investment can have on the communities and environment of Central Asia. The findings identify more than 15,000 km of rail and 20,000 km of roads linked to the BRI crisscrossing the region in 2018. Whilst these transport corridors have improved connectivity, many of these rails and roads traverse important agricultural and water zones, creating undetermined risks and opportunities. Land use change was examined within a 10-km buffer around BRI roads and rails from 2008 to 2018. Railways increased by 23% during this time, yet irrigated and rainfed agriculture decreased whilst urban areas markedly expanded. Contextual research identifies how Chinese policies may encourage agribusiness investment for food exports as possible disruptions to national and regional food supply. However, to date Central Asia provides <1% of Chinese agricultural imports. In fact, Afghanistan is the region's dominant export market, tripling agricultural imports >300% in this time. Similarly, five times more livestock are traded within the region than to China. Evaluating infrastructure change is essential to understand BRI impacts on environments and societies, with the food-water nexus a particular concern in Central Asia. Limited Chinese imports of Central Asian agriculture suggests the region's food security will not be significantly altered by the Belt and Road Initiative.

J	Wu, RY; Lawes, R; Oliver, Y; Fletcher, A; Chen, C				Wu, Renye; Lawes, Roger; Oliver, Yvette; Fletcher, Andrew; Chen, Chao			How well do we need to estimate plant-available water capacity to simulate water-limited yield potential?	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												A key determinant of water-limited yield potential in dryland agriculture is the soil's plant available water capacity (PAWC), the difference between drained upper limit and crop lower limit over the rooting depth. To simulate water-limited yield potential (Yw), a crop model must be parameterised for the local edaphic conditions, which require a quantitative description of drained upper limit, crop lower limit and rooting depth. Often, these soil properties have to be estimated from existing soil surveys, which creates uncertainty for drained upper limit, crop lower limit or rooting depth. The impact of uncertainty in these soil properties on the estimation of Yw has not previously been reported. Using the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM), a sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the effect of uncertainties in drained upper limit, crop lower limit and rooting depth on wheat Yw for two contrasting rainfall sites (high and low) with two typical soil types (shallow sandy duplex and clay) in Western Australia. Simulation results demonstrated that the resultant change in PAWC was the dominant driver of a change in the estimate of Yw, irrespective of whether such a change was caused by drained upper limit, crop lower limit or rooting depth. Estimated errors that underestimated or overestimated PAWC by up to 20 mm only had a marginal impact on Yw (less than 200 kg ha(-1)) in all environments (soil type x location). But when this error was more than 20 mm, an underestimation would cause more severe deviation of Yw of wheat than an overestimation. On average, 40 mm underestimation of PAWC resulted into 530 kg ha(-1) of Yw, while this amount of overestimation caused overestimation of Yw about 290 kg ha(-1). The bias of underestimated wheat Yw due to underestimation of PAWC was generally increased with rainfall up to 350 mm. We conclude that it is better to estimate soil hydrological parameters towards overestimating PAWC than to underestimate PAWC. However, where possible, all three soil hydrological parameters should be estimated as accurately as possible.

However, little work on the labile C fractions in South Africa has been documented. As such, this work focused on C fractions under different management systems. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of different tillage techniques and fertilizer application rates on soil C fractions along the soil profile. Samples from no-till (NT), conventional tillage after 5th season (CT-Y5), and annual conventional tillage, longer than 5 years (CT-ANNUAL) at 0, 60, 120, and 240 kg N ha(-1) were taken at 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm depths and analyzed for C fractions. The 30 cm depth was chosen as the sampling depth because of the 30 cm plough layer. At 0-10 cm, soil NT had higher total C, organic C, particulate organic C (POC), and permanganate oxidizable C (POxC) for all application rates, especially in the control treatment, compared to both the CT-Y5 and CT-ANNUAL treatments (p < 0.05). At the 10-20 cm soil depth, CT-Y5 had higher POC than both NT and CT-ANNUAL at 60 kg N ha(-1) (p < 0.05). Greater C fractions in the surface soil under NT, and at deeper depths under CT, was due to litter availability on the surface under NT and incorporation to the subsoil on CT. Higher C sequestration in NT than in CT-Y5 and CT-ANNUAL was observed because of slower organic matter (OM) turnover in NT leading to the formation and stabilization of C. A larger input over output of OM, through high crop residue accumulation over decomposition, is the reason for the increase of C fractions in the fertilized treatments. Therefore, using conservation agriculture, particular NT, with 0 kg N ha(-1) application rate in dryland agriculture is recommended.																				2073-4395				JUL	2022	12	7							1725	10.3390/agronomy12071725	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12071725													WOS:000831459500001
J	Grenfell, S; Grenfell, M				Grenfell, S.; Grenfell, M.			Characterising the late Quaternary facies stratigraphy of floodplains in South Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY												South African river floodplains and their alluvial deposits reflect a diversity of geological and geographical drivers. We use a genetic geomorphic classification system originally developed for dryland wetlands to characterise geomorphic processes and potential successions of sedimentary fill for South African floodplains. Using case studies from the literature, we consider differences between alluvial rivers and mixed bedrock-alluvial rivers in the context of macro-scale geomorphic setting, and evaluate the impact of the setting on floodplain persistence and potential as a palaeo-environmental archive. Sedimentary facies associations represented in South African floodplains, including lateral and oblique accretion, channel, channel infill, levee vertical accretion, floodplain vertical accretion and debris flow deposits, are also evaluated. Floodplains of South Africa's interior are typically mixed bedrock-alluvial as channel beds are set upon or close to bedrock and sediment thickness is limited. By contrast some floodplains in tectonic basin settings have sediment deposits exceeding 30 m in thickness. The resulting rivers are alluvial, and thus able to adjust their width, depth and slope to accommodate changes in discharge and sediment supply. Similarly, coastal floodplain rivers are alluvial due to downcutting during the last glacial maximum and subsequent sedimentary infilling as sea levels rose. When considering the potential of floodplains as palaeo archives of environmental change, two considerations emerge. First, floodplain stratigraphy is not a response to a single variable due to complex process-form feedbacks. Rather, floodplain stratigraphy is an outcome of both autogenic and allogenic processes. Second, most South African floodplains are zones of sediment recycling, and as such, preservation potential is typically low. Thus, although floodplain settings of the interior may be a few million years old, the sediment within them may be only thousands to tens of thousands of years old. Our review indicates that research has historically focused on meandering river and mixed bedrock-alluvial anabranching river floodplains, while understanding of other floodplain sub-types remains limited.

J	Wei, W; Pan, DL; Feng, J				Wei, Wei; Pan, Daili; Feng, Jing			Tradeoffs between soil conservation and soil-water retention: The role of vegetation pattern and density	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Balancing erosion control and the water conservation service is the primary goal of intensive revegetation in water-limited conditions. In this study, a field experiment was conducted in the dryland Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP), to investigate the role of vegetation pattern and density in their tradeoff between soil conservation (SC) and soil water retention (SWR). Five vegetation patterns (up-slope covered, downslope covered, low and high uniformly covered, no coverage) with three levels of grass density (220 g m(-2), 110 g m(-2), and 0) were designed and implemented. A novel indicator EEW (the exchange between erosion reduction and water consumption), as the cost of any extra depletion of soil water to improve each unit of soil conservation, was used to represent the tradeoff during a complete dry-wet-dry soil water convert cycle. The higher EEW, the poorer tradeoff between SC and SWR. It was illustrated that higher vegetation density could promote SC but not inevitably suppress EEW. The present typical grass density in CLP, round 220 g m(-2), was redundant in optimizing the SC-SWR tradeoff. A concentrated and centralized vegetation distribution mainly in the downslope obtained an EEW at 11.6 mm m(2) kg(-1) and was confirmed as a favoured vegetation pattern. The simulated typical density and spatial pattern in CLP (about 220 g m(-2) and uniformly distribution) had EEW at 20.5 mm m(2) kg(-1), by reducing the density to about 110 g m(-2) and a downslope centralized vegetation redistribution, the EEW was reduced by 43.4%. Under long-term drought conditions at dry-wet-dry cycles, soil water decreased more sharply in the Full-covered plots, due to more evapotranspiration and vertical water loss caused by higher plant density, compared with half-covered and bare soil plots.

Efficiency of the t-distribution stochastic neighbor embedding technique for detailed visualization and modeling interactions between agricultural soil quality indicators	BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING												Dimensionality reduction is important for revealing important details that may be useful in decision-making. Although different dimensionality reduction methods have been applied in several soil-based studies, Kohonen self-organizing map neural network (KSOM-NN) has attracted significant attention from researchers because of the quality of data visualization and interpretation. However, there is a dearth of studies that compare KSOM-NN and other robust data reduction techniques such as the t-distribution stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method to improve visualization and interpretation of the relationships between soil quality indicators in agricultural soil. This study compares the above-mentioned methods for characterizing soil quality indicators including particle size distribution, soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil reaction (pH), electrical conductivity (EC), zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), potassium (K) and phosphorus (P) in agricultural dryland. There were strongly positive associations identified between some of the variables studied for example, clay/Fe (r = 0.95), clay/SOM (r = 0.79) and Mn/Zn (r = 0.90) based on the correlation matrix output. According to the KSOM-NN, the best map size was a 4 by 7 with Quantization error (QE) = 0.108, Topographic error (TE) = 0.875 and KaskiLagus error (K-LE) = 9.104. This map only yielded 2 main clusters. As for the t-SNE, applying various perplexity values (i.e. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10) enabled better visualization of the soil quality indicators as observed from the cluster formations than the KSOM-NN. Ultimately, the t-SNE was considered a better and promising method for assessing the interactions of soil quality indicators and has the potential to appropriately visualise as well as improve the interpretability of soil results by identifying essential features and similarities. The results of this study have good implications for agricultural soil management and decision-making. Moreover, the results are preliminary findings that may be used in the future to verify detailed aspects of soil biogeochemistry within the study area. (c) 2021 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Trees can incorporate the isotopic signals into annual tree-ring cellulose records, permitting reconstruction of the temporal changes of hydroclimate over decades to millennia. This is especially valuable in the Himalayas where the understanding of monsoon dynamics is limited by the lack of a dense and representative observational network. We have analyzed tree ring delta O-18 records from two distinct physiographic sites along the upper Kali Gandaki valley in the central Nepal Himalayas, representing the wet High-Himalayas and the Trans-Himalayan dryland to the north. Empirical correlations and regression analyses were compared to an in-situ calibrated oxygen isotope fractionation model, exploring the relationships between tree ring delta O-18 and seasonal-mean variability of hydroclimatic forcing at the different locations. For this purpose, gridded precipitation data from the Asian rain gauge dataset APHRODITE, as well as high resolution onsite observations (relative humidity, air temperature, delta O-18 of precipitation and radial tree growth) were used. We found that two distinct sets of meteorological values, reflecting pre-monsoon and monsoon conditions, are needed to reproduce the measured tree ring delta O-18 values from the High-Himalayan site, but that a single set of monsoonal values performs best for the Trans-Himalayan site. We conclude that Trans-Himalayan trees capture long-term changes in strength of the Indian summer monsoon. In contrast, High-Himalayan tree ring delta(18)Orecords a more complex hydro-climatic signal reflecting both pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons with very contrasting isotopic signatures of precipitation. This difference in the two hydroclimatic proxy records offers an opportunity to reconstruct first-order hydroclimate conditions, such as local precipitation rates, and to gain new insights into monsoon timing and seasonal water source determination across the Himalayan orographic region.

Yet, commonly used strategies to reduce encroachment show a low medium-term success, calling for a better understanding of its causes. Previous works identified multiple drivers responsible for this phenomenon, including anthropogenic and environmental causes. However, the relative effect of climate, topography and edaphic factors on shrub encroachment is not fully understood nor has been properly quantified in Mediterranean Basin drylands. Also, understanding how these drivers lead to changes in plant communities functional traits associated to shrub encroachment is crucial, considering traits influence ecosystem processes and associated ecosystem services. Here, we studied the understory of a Mediterranean dryland ecosystem composed of savanna-like Holm-oak woodlands, along a regional climatic gradient. We specifically assessed (i) how climatic, topographic and edaphic factors influence understory relative shrub cover (RSC) and (ii) their direct and indirect effects (via RSC) on plant functional traits. We studied the mean and diversity of 12 functional traits related to plant regeneration, establishment, and dispersal, at the community-level. We found that, under similar low-intensity land use, topographic and edaphic factors, namely slope variations and soil C:N ratio, were the most important predictors of shrub encroachment, determining communities' functional characteristics. Climate, namely summer precipitation, had a much lesser influence. Our model explained 52% of the variation in relative shrub cover. Climate had a stronger effect on a set of functional traits weakly involved in shrub encroachment, related to flowering and dispersal strategies. We show that shrub encroachment is largely predicted by topo-edaphic factors in Mediterranean drylands subject to conventional low-intensity land use. Hence, management strategies to reduce encroachment need to take these drivers into account for effluent forecasting and higher cost-effectiveness. Our results suggest that climate change might not greatly impact shrub encroachment in the Mediterranean Basin, but may affect functional structure and reduce functional diversity of plant communities, thus affecting ecosystem functioning.

Artificially simulated rainfall experiments were carried out under three slope gradients (10 degrees, 15 degrees, and 20 degrees), three rainfall intensities (1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mm.min(-1)), and four dry-spreading rates of polysaccharides (0, 1, 3, and 5 g.m(-2)). The results showed that (1) four hydrodynamic parameters (flow velocity, shear stress, stream power, and unit stream power) all increased with both rainfall intensities and slope gradients at four rates of polysaccharides. (2) Polysaccharides could effectively reduce hydrodynamic parameters. In contrast to the bare slope, the average flow velocity, shear stress, stream power, and unit stream power diminished by 27.11 similar to 41.18%, 9.53 similar to 18.67%, 31.82 similar to 50.24%, and 27.11 similar to 41.18%, respectively. (3) Polysaccharides could effectively reduce the growth rate of the sheet erosion modulus with hydrodynamic parameters, and there were few differences among the different rates (1, 3, and 5 g.m(-2)). The increasing rates of the sheet erosion modulus with flow velocity, shear stress, stream power, and unit stream power were 14.0 similar to 65.7%, 14.8 similar to 33.9%, 7.8 similar to 23.7%, and 9.7 similar to 29.5%, respectively. (4) At different polysaccharides rates, the relationships between sheet erosion modulus and hydrodynamic parameters were all in logarithmic functions. Moreover, flow velocity (R-2 >= 0.920) and stream power (R-2 >= 0.876) were better hydrodynamic parameters than shear stress (R-2 >= 0.598) or unit stream power (R-2 >= 0.537). Polysaccharides decreased the hydrodynamic parameters and the response rates of sheet erosion to hydrodynamics.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2022	29	53			SI		80705	80715		10.1007/s11356-022-21481-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-21481-7		JUN 2022						35727511					WOS:000814042300012

Unfortunately, their sustainability is being compromised by different anthropogenic and natural factors. However, impacts of the on-going land-use and climate change on the population structure and distribution of the species are less explored. This study was carried out in the grazing lands and hillside areas of the Desa'a dry Afromontane-forest, northern Ethiopia, to characterize the population structure of the species and predict the impact of climate change on their potential distributions. In each land-use type, abundance, diameter and height of the trees were collected using 70 sampling plots distributed over seven transects spaced one km apart. The geographic coordinates of each individual tree were also recorded. The results showed that the species pop-ulations were characterized by low abundance and unstable population structure. The latter was evinced by a lack of seedlings and mature trees. The study also revealed that the total abundance and dendrometric traits of the trees were significantly different between the two land-uses. The hillside areas had denser abundance with bigger and taller trees than the grazing lands. Climate change predictions using the MaxEnt model highlighted that future temperature increases coupled with reduced precipitation would lead to significant reductions in the suitable habitats of the species in northern Ethiopia. The species suitable habitats were predicted to decline by 48-83% for D. ombet and 35-87% for D. glabra. Hence, to sustain the species populations, different strategies should be adopted, namely the introduction of alternative livelihoods (e.g., gathering NTFP) to reduce the overexploitation of the species for subsistence livelihood, and the protection of the current habitats of the species that will remain suitable in the future using community-based exclosures. Additionally, the preservation of the species' seeds in gene banks is crucial to ensure their long-term conservation.																			1617-1381	1618-1093				DEC	2023	76								126506	10.1016/j.jnc.2023.126506	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2023.126506													WOS:001105613300001

An open-source GIS approach to understanding dunefield morphologic variability at Kati Thanda (Lake Eyre), Central Australia	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Future climate projections indicate an expansion of the world's drylands, and with that a commensurate increase in the mobilization of unconsolidated desert sediments such as sand and dust. It is therefore increasingly important to investigate the large-scale formation of dryland landscapes such as dunefields in order to better understand the processes responsible for their genesis, evolution, and thresholds for mobilization. Assessing dunefield morphologic variability, including analysis of the morphologic relationship between aeolian bedforms and other landforms such as fluvial channels and bedrock uplands, underpins such investigations. So far, however, meaningful investigations of erg-scale geomorphic patterns have been limited. This is in part due to the technological limitations of geographic information system (GIS) tools, particularly in the case of open-source datasets and software, which has effectively hindered investigations by colleagues in drylands of the global south where many of the world's dunefields are located. Recent years have overseen the increasing availability of open-source remote sensing datasets, as well as the development of freely available software which can undertake geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA). These new tools facilitate cartography and statistical analysis of dunefields at large scales. In this study we make use of open-source GIS to characterise a morphologically diverse linear dunefield southwest of Kati Thanda (Lake Eyre) in central Australia. We focus on three parameters; dune orientation, spacing and Y-junctions using semi-automated GEOBIA, and investigate these in the context of local fluvial channels, depressions (pans) and uplands. Our results suggest a possible correlation between dune orientation, wind regime and the role of uplands as deflective barriers to longitudinal dune migration; dune spacing and sediment supply, likely relating to the location of both ephemeral and abandoned fluvial channels; and Y-junction frequency with underlying topography. Our study provides a framework for understanding process-based interactions between dunes and other landforms, as well as the first completely open-source approach which can be applied to linear dunefields worldwide.

J	Yue, XF; Zhang, TH; Li, YQ				Yue, Xiangfei; Zhang, Tonghui; Li, Yanqing			Effects of rainfall regime during the growing season on the annual plant communities in semiarid sandy land, northeast China	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Climate change is expected to result in more extreme rainfall regimes that are characterized by intensified rainfall events and prolonged dry intervals. However, to date, the response of the dryland ecosystems to changes in the rainfall regime has remained unresolved. To better understand the effects of individual dry intervals and extreme rainfall regimes on the aboveground/ belowground net primary productivity (ANPP/BNPP) and species diversity of semi-arid sandy grassland, this study aimed to assess the influence of the timing and frequency of prolonged dry intervals on the function of a degraded sandy grassland under a constant total growing-season rainfall. A field rainfall manipulation experiment was carried out in northeast China. The results showed that the 30 day dry interval caused a significant decrease in ANPP and plant cover, except for April. The 30 day dry interval substantially increased the allocation of total net primary productivity (NPP) to BNPP in July, while decreasing the species richness in May and June. The extreme rainfall regimes with lower frequency and longer dry intervals significantly decreased the ANPP, BNPP, plant cover, species richness and species diversity index, while increasing the allocation of the NPP to BNPP and plant density. The mean duration of the dry interval exhibited significant negative correlations with the ANPP, plant cover, species richness, and Simpson index. Variability in dry interval's mean length also had a negative correlation with ANPP, plant cover, and species richness. Our results suggest that annuals in the semiarid sandy land were highly responsive to changes in rainfall regime. Even if rainfall amount remained constant, increases in duration of the dry intervals and the frequency of extreme intervals were more likely to reduce net primary productivity and species diversity in semiarid sandy annual grasslands, and even contribute to desertification. The findings also provide new evidence for the vital roles of dry interval frequency, duration, and timing, as determinants of semiarid ecosystem function and structure.																				2351-9894				JUN	2023	43								e02456	10.1016/j.gecco.2023.e02456	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2023.e02456		APR 2023											WOS:001003418100001

Modulation of Wheat Yield Components in Response to Management Intensification to Reduce Yield Gaps	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Appropriate genotype selection and management can impact wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield in dryland environments, but their impact on yield components and their role in yield modulation are not well understood. Our objectives were to evaluate the yield response of commercial winter wheat genotypes to different management practices reflecting a stepwise increase in management intensity (including a reduction in crop density under high input), and to quantify how the different yield components modulate wheat yield. A factorial experiment evaluated six management (M) intensities ["farmer practice" (FP), "enhanced fertility" (EF), "ecological intensification" (EI), "increased foliar protection" (IFP), "water-limited yield" (Yw), and "increased plant productivity" (IPP)] and four winter wheat genotypes (G) in four Kansas environments (E). Average grain yield was 4.9 Mg ha(-1) and ranged from 2.0 to 7.4 Mg ha(-1), with significant two-way interactions (E x M and E x G). The EF usually maximized yields in dry environments, while EI, which consisted of EF plus one fungicide application, maximized yields in environments with greater water availability. Across all sources of variation, kernels m(-2) and aboveground biomass were the strongest modulators of yield as compared to kernel weight and harvest index, while spikes m(-2) and kernels spike(-1) modulated yields at a similar magnitude. Foliar fungicides improved yield through increased green canopy cover duration and greater radiation intercepted during grain filling. When crop density was reduced from 2.7 to 1.1 million plants per hectare in an otherwise high-input system, plants produced more productive tillers (with genotype-specific response); however, reduced green canopy cover at anthesis and reduced cumulative solar radiation intercepted during grain filling limited wheat yield-although large differences in canopy cover or intercepted radiation were needed to cause modest changes in yield. Treatments more intensive than EI were not warranted as EF or EI maximized yields at all environments, and practices that promote biomass and kernels m(-2) are to be targeted for future increases in wheat yield.																			1664-462X					MAY 2	2022	13								772232	10.3389/fpls.2022.772232	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.772232								35586210					WOS:000796942900001

Wild. in relation to origin and ploidy level: Implications for climatic adaptation	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Correct timing of phenology is crucial for the survival and growth of species in arid areas with long dry seasons. Nevertheless, knowledge on genetic variation and adaptive patterns in phenology in deciduous African dryland species is limited. Here we study the variation in phenology of diploid and polypoid A. senegal trees from rangewide populations growing in a common garden trial in Senegal and test correlations between population phenology and climate at the site of origin. The leafing, flowering and fruiting phenology was monitored during 17 months and compared to detailed observations of the rainfall in the common garden during the period. We found that A. senegal trees in general started development of leaves prior to the beginning of the rainy season with flowering and fruiting initiation occurring during the rainy season. The results lead us to conclude that is was not the rain per se that initiated leaf development. We also conclude that phenology in A. senegal is under genetic control, because significant differences could be observed among populations and ploidy levels when grown at the same site. In general, early leaf flushing trees had a longer growing period and performed better in terms of growth at the tested site and the results thus support that leaf phenology influence fitness. We further found that differences among trees in phenology seem to be associated with differences in climate at their site of origin, because the timing of leaf development in the common garden and the timing of the rainy season at the site of origin was significantly correlated for the diploid trees (not for tetraploids). However, it was diploid trees from sites with a late arriving rainy season that developed leaves earliest in the year. The environmental cues that control leafing phenology and the associated physiological mechanisms therefore still need to be identified in order to understand how the variation among populations has evolved, its relationship to local adaptation and the implication for smart transfer of seed sources as mean to mitigate changing growing conditions related to global warming.

Farmland mulching is often used to preserve the soil moisture and increase crop yields. However, the impacts of long-term farmland mulching practices on the soil fungal communities in the loessial soil in semiarid areas of China were less explored. Thus, we investigated the variations in the soil fungal communities under different mulching patterns using high-throughput sequencing to understand how different mulching practices affect these communities. The following treatments were investigated: ridge-furrow mulching pattern (R), flat plastic film mulching (P), flat biodegradable film mulching (B), flat straw mulching (S), and conventional flat planting without mulching as a control (CK). Farmland mulching practices significantly affected the soil fungal diversity and community structure by changing the soil properties. Compared with CK, the P and S treatments significantly increased the soil fungal diversity, thereby suggesting that these practices provided the most suitable growth environment for fungi. The soil moisture and nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) content were the most important factors that affected the fungal diversity. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination showed that the fungal communities in CK were separated from those in R and B treatments and closely clustered with the communities in the P and S treatments, thereby suggesting that the fungal community compositions differed slightly between the P and S treatments and the CK treatment, but the soil fungal community compositions in the R and B treatments differed significantly from that in CK. In addition, the fungal community composition depended primarily on the soil temperature and NO3-N. These results indicate that different farmland mulching practices affected the soil moisture, soil temperature, and NO3-N to change the soil fungal community distribution patterns in this region. Overall, the soil fungal diversity and abundance were both higher in the P treatment than the other treatments. Therefore, flat plastic film mulching is recommended for semiarid areas.

These responses are further influenced by the interactions between host plant and the associated rhizospheric and endophytic microorganisms. The endophytic microorganisms, due to their intimate proximity with the host plant, are considered to have major influence on plant's physiological responses. In the present study, three drought tolerant and plant growth promoting maize seed endophytic bacteria, Bacillus sp. MSEB 17, Bacillus sp. MSEB 72 and Bacillus sp. MSEB 78 were used as seed inoculants in maize (var Bioseed 9681) under drought stress conditions in a growth chamber pot study and their influence on four drought responsive genes (Zmdhnl, GRAIZA/I2G055844, GRAIZA/I2G467339 and GRAIZA/12G109448) in maize leaves was studied by real time PCR using specific primers. The influence of inoculation on host plant's response to drought was evident from altered expression of target genes when compared with uninoculated plants. Notably, inoculation with MSEB 17 increased the expression of three target genes, Zmdhnl (dehydrin) gene, GRAIZA/I2G467339 gene and GRAIZA/12G109448 gene by several folds. This study revealed the role of endophytic in alleviating the effect of drought stress in maize plants through regulating plant growth and physiological response.					bodhankar, shrey/ADK-8526-2022	bodhankar, shrey/0000-0002-7689-1781; Mohapatra, Sridev/0000-0002-8462-6902; Manjunath, M/0000-0003-4815-6074													1338-5178					OCT-NOV	2020	10	2					267	272		10.15414/jmbfs.2020.10.2.267-272	http://dx.doi.org/10.15414/jmbfs.2020.10.2.267-272													WOS:000577909700020

In order to solve this problem, combined with the interaction between the ejector rod and the bowl seedling, this paper analyzes the working principle of the ejector rod conveyor belt seedling harvesting mechanism, and optimizes the design of the ejector rod conveyor belt seedling harvesting mechanism. By using the method of EDEM simulation analysis and orthogonal experiment, taking the breaking rate and success rate of bowl seedling as the test response index, the effects of ejector rod end form, ejector rod diameter and seedling extraction speed were studied, and the results were analyzed by range analysis and variance analysis to analyze the influence law of the interaction of various factors on bowl seedling extraction. The simulation results show that the crushing rate of bowl seedlings increases with the increase of seedling speed and the decrease of ejector diameter. Among the three different types of ejectors, the effect of round head ejector is the best. The best parameter combination of the seedling mechanism is the diameter of the ejector rod 10mm, the seedling speed 2m/s, and the ejector rod in the form of round head ejector rod. The verification experiment shows that the seedling extraction effect of the optimized seedling extraction mechanism is better than that of the original seedling extraction mechanism. The results show that when the best combination of working parameters is used to collect seedlings, the qualified rate of seedlings is not less than 90%, the fragmentation rate is not higher than 20%, and the seedling performance is relatively stable. The optimized seedling extraction mechanism can be used in the automatic dryland bowl seedling transplanter to meet the operational requirements of the automatic transplanter.																			2068-4215	2068-2239				JAN-APR	2023	69	1					109	120		10.35633/inmateh-69-10	http://dx.doi.org/10.35633/inmateh-69-10													WOS:000996501400007

Scott; Anderson, Andrew; McCorriston, Joy			Human landscape modification and expansion of tropical woodland in southern Arabia during the mid-Holocene from rock hyrax middens	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Dryland ecosystems, such as those in southern Arabia, are particularly vulnerable to climate and land-use change. Aridification and human subsistence changes at the end of the Holocene Humid Period at 6-4 ka have been used as an iconic example for evaluating such impacts to resilience of arid systems. Although records of ancient environments can provide critical insight into the biotic and abiotic mechanisms that alter ecosystems, traditional archives, such as lake deposits, are not common in southern Arabia after 6 ka; thus, we must use alternative archives. Location Yemen. Taxon Plants; Rock Hyrax (Procavia capensis). Methods We use fossil pollen and stable isotopes (delta N-15; delta C-13) of rock hyrax (P. capensis) middens from Wadi Sana, Yemen, to look at changes in ecosystem structure and function across this key transition from 6 ka to the present. A total of 17 middens were radiocarbon-dated and stable isotopes were measured. Of these, pollen was extracted from hyraceum of 14 middens and identified using a light microscope. Fossil pollen assemblages were then compared to existing modern pollen samples from throughout Arabia. Results During the mid-Holocene from at least 6 to 4.7 ka, the pollen flora reflects a landscape with abundant tropical trees. These included foundational woody taxa, such as Terminalia and Boswellia sacra (frankincense), which had a strong positive influence on local hydrology and the economy, respectively. Increased charcoal abundances also suggest that wildfire occurred periodically. Main conclusions Connections with archaeological evidence suggest a strong link between human management and the presence of Terminalia woodland during the mid-Holocene. These may have promoted increased groundwater storage and ponding as regional rainfall was decreasing. The mid-Holocene expansion of Boswellia sacra (frankincense) may have helped support resin trade that became a critical export from the region. Fires were more common than today, suggesting semi-arid but continuous vegetation cover across what is now bare ground. Finally, after 1 ka, increased sedge abundances at the expense of grasses and trees suggest the development of desert conditions.

Local-regional similarity in drylands increases during multiyear wet and dry periods and in response to extreme events	ECOSPHERE												Climate change is predicted to impact ecosystems through altered precipitation (PPT) regimes. In the Chihuahuan Desert, multiyear wet and dry periods and extreme PPT pulses are the most influential climatic events for vegetation. Vegetation responses are most frequently studied locally, and regional responses are often unclear. We present an approach to quantify correlation of PPT and vegetation responses (as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI]) at the Jornada ARS-LTER site (JRN; 550 km(2) area) and the surrounding dryland region (from 0 to 500 km distance; 400,000 km(2) study area) as a way to understand regional similarity to locally observed patterns. We focused on fluctuating wet and dry years, multiyear wet or dry periods of 3-4 yr, and multiyear wet periods that contained one or more extreme high PPT pulses or extreme low rainfall. In all but extreme high PPT years, JRN PPT was highly correlated (r > 0.9) to PPT across the regional study area (0-500 km distance; high correlation from 25th to 75th percentiles) and was highly correlated across a greater PPT range subregionally (0-200 km distance; high correlation from 10th to 90th percentiles). In contrast, the statistical distribution of JRN NDVI was less similar to that of regional NDVI. Yet, local-regional NDVI similarity increased during multiyear periods to a maximum of >90% similarity for 10th-90th percentiles in a number of years. Thus, local-regional heterogeneity in PPT and vegetation responses is reduced in both multiyear wet and dry periods, with the largest changes in climatic forcing and responses during multiyear wet periods. These wet and dry events support greater similarity between local-regional PPT and vegetation response patterns. We conclude that site-based research on multiyear periods can be extended to anticipate larger regional responses, and illustrate the opportunity to enhance understanding of future PPT change through increased focus on multiyear periods.

Land Use and Seasonal Effects on the Soil Microbiome of a Brazilian Dry Forest	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Drylands occupy approximately 41% of the Earth's terrestrial surface. Climate change and land use practices are expected to affect biogeochemical cycling by the soil microbiome in these ecosystems. Understanding how soil microbial community might respond to these drivers is extremely important to mitigate the processes of land degradation and desertification. The Caatinga, an exclusively Brazilian biome composed of an extensive seasonal tropical dry forest, is exposed to variable spatiotemporal rainfall patterns as well as strong human-driven pressures. Herein, an integrated analysis of shotgun metagenomics approach coupled to meteorological data was employed to unravel the impact of seasonality and land use change on soil microbiome from preserved and agriculture-affected experimental fields in Caatinga drylands. Multivariate analysis suggested that microbial communities of preserved soils under seasonal changes were shaped primarily by water deficit, with a strong increase of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria members in the dry and rainy seasons, respectively. In contrast, nutrient availability notably played a critical role in driving the microbial community in agriculture-affected soils. The strong enrichment of bacterial genera belonging to the poorly-known phylum Acidobacteria ('Candidatus Solibacter' and 'Candidatus Koribacter') in soils from dry season affected by ferti-irrigation practices presupposes a contrasting copiotrophic lifestyle and ecological role in mitigating the impact of chemical fertilization. Functional analyses identify overrepresented genes related to osmotic stress response (synthesis of osmoprotectant compounds, accumulation of potassium ions) and preferential carbon and nitrogen utilization when comparing the microbiome of preserved soils under seasonal changes, reflecting differences in the genetic potential for nutrient cycling and C acquisition in the environment. However, the prevalence of nitrosative stress and denitrification functions in irrigation/fertilization-affected soils of the dry season clearly suggest that nutrient input and disruption of natural water regime may impact biogeochemical cycles linked to the microbial processes, with potential impacts on the ecosystem functionality. These findings help to better understand how natural seasonality and agricultural management differentially affect soil microbial ecology from dry forests, providing support for the development of more sustainable land management in dryland ecosystems.

Moench) accessions using single nucleotide polymorphism markers	PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES-CHARACTERIZATION AND UTILIZATION												Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is an important resource to the national economy and it is essential to assess the genetic diversity in existing sorghum germplasm for better conservation, utilization and crop improvement. The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of genetic diversity within and among sorghum germplasms collected from diverse institutes in Nigeria and Mali using Single Nucleotide Polymorphic markers. Genetic diversity among the germplasm was low with an average polymorphism information content value of 0.24. Analysis of Molecular Variation revealed 6% variation among germplasm and 94% within germplasms. Dendrogram revealed three groups of clustering which indicate variations within the germplasms. Private alleles identified in the sorghum accessions from National Center for Genetic Resources and Biotechnology, Ibadan, Nigeria and International Crop Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, Kano, Nigeria shows their prospect for sorghum improvement and discovery of new agronomic traits. The presence of private alleles and genetic variation within the germplasms indicates that the accessions are valuable resources for future breeding programs.

Spatial and temporal variation in the runoff potential and irrigation requirement of crops under changing climatic scenarios in the Western Vidarbha zone in Maharashtra	JOURNAL OF AGROMETEOROLOGY					3rd International Symposium on Advances in Agrometeorology for Managing Climatic Risks of Farmers (INAGMET)	FEB 11-13, 2019	New Delhi, INDIA	Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Indian Council Agr Res & Indian Agr Res Inst, India Meteorol Dept, Assoc Agrometeorologists, Delhi Chapter				The Western Vidarbha zone of Maharashtra has an average rainfall of 800 mm and dry spells are commonly experienced during July, August and September which coincides with the vegetative or reproductive stages of major rainfed crops. By providing one or two supplemental irrigation to these crops during critical growth stages can increase the yield considerably. Hence, estimation of runoff potential, its harvesting and optimal application is very important. In order to ensure long-term sustainability of crops, runoff potential and irrigation requirement of major crops were determined and analyzed for present and future scenarios. Higher rainfall was observed in few blocks of Amaravathi and Nagpur and lower in Buldana district. Considerable spatial variation in the irrigation requirement of major crops shows the need for site specific irrigation scheduling for this zone. A decreasing trend of rainfall in low rainfall areas and an increasing trend in high rainfall areas are predicted by 2050's. Under climate change scenarios, an increase in the irrigation requirement of crops is expected for Buldana, Akola and Washim whereas a decreasing trend is projected for Nagpur, Wardha and parts of Amaravati and Yavatmal districts. The irrigation requirement predicted for kharif maize, pigeon pea, soybean, kharif sorghum and chickpea are not varying substantially at Akola by 2050's. Hence, adoption of these crops in suitable soils could be one option for sustainable agriculture in future. In this region, runoff potential was relatively higher in Washim, Wardha and Nagpur districts and an increase in runoff potential predicted for major portion of the area by 2050's showed higher potential for rainwater harvesting in future.																			0972-1665					JUN	2020	22				SI		204	209																WOS:000595371800032

Reservoir quality and diagenesis of Triassic sandstones and siltstones from arid fluvial and playa margin environments: A study of one of the UK's earliest producing oilfields	MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												The Triassic stratigraphy of the UK contains many important reservoir rock units, present in all major offshore and onshore basins, that are rich in oil, gas and water resources. The Ormskirk Sandstone Formation (Sherwood Sandstone Group) and Tarporley Siltstone Formation (Mercia Mudstone Group) represent the main reservoirs found in one of the UK's earliest producing oilfields, at an unusually shallow depth of 30-90 m. In this study, environments of deposition, maximum burial depth, and reservoir quality have been evaluated from well Formby-7, drilled in 2012, using modern analytical techniques. Wireline data and core analysis data were made available by Aurora Energy Resources for the purposes of this study. Formby-7 was continuously cored so that the whole section was logged for sedimentary structures and grain size. Optical analysis of thin sections was conducted, along with SEM-EDS, using thin sections from core plugs. The Ormskirk Sandstone Formation was deposited in a proximal setting by a braided, dryland river with aeolian influence; the Tarporley Siltstone Formation was deposited in a more distal setting on the margins of a playa environment. The study found that the reservoir quality is excellent in the deeper Ormskirk sediments, but relatively poor in the overlying Tarporley sediments. Good reservoir quality present in the Ormskirk Sandstone Formation is linked to early depositional textures, grain size (medium sand) and general lack of pore-filling cements. In the Tarporley, reservoir quality is poor due to the grain size (very fine sand) and the variable presence of pore-filling gypsum associated with playa deposits. Minor feldspar diagenesis (both dissolution and precipitation) occurred in both the Sherwood and Mercia sediments. The small degree of mechanical compaction and lack of any signs of mesodiagenesis suggest that the clastic sediments in the Formby-7 well have not been buried deeper than about 1000 m. The findings reported here can be used to help the understanding of UK Triassic sedimentology and reservoir quality for oil and gas, geothermal energy, CCS (carbon capture storage) and water supply.					worden, Richard H/B-7779-2008														0264-8172	1873-4073				SEP	2021	131								105154	10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2021.105154	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2021.105154		JUN 2021											WOS:000672574200001

However, systematic investigations of the spatial associations between the potential, flow, and demand of the nutrient regulation service are still lacking. Therefore, we performed a case study comparing the total phosphorus (TP) retention in the Dianchi Lake (DL) watershed (human-dominated) with that in the Lower Reach of the Zi River (LRZR) watershed (nature-dominated). We used four indicators-TP retention potential, TP retention, TP load, and TP export-to represent the potential, flow, demand, and flow-demand budget of the TP retention service, respectively. We estimated the TP retention and export using the InVEST tool, mapped the four TP indicators and calculated their correlations, and estimated the contributions of different ecosystem types and terrain ranges to TP retention and export. We determined the following: (1) the incongruity between the spatial distribution of the TP retention potential and the other three TP indicators was smaller in the LRZR watershed than in the DL watershed; (2) the TP retention potentials generally increased-while the other three TP indicators decreased-with increases in the elevation gradient in the DL watershed and the slope gradients in both study areas; and (3) paddy fields exhibited the highest TP retention intensity and residential areas exhibited the highest TP export intensity among the major ecosystem types in both study areas. Moreover, the TP retention intensities of dryland crops and residential areas in the DL watershed were much higher than they were in the LRZR watershed. Our findings imply that the flow of the nutrient retention service is influenced more by the service demand than by the service potential and that it is influenced by both landscape composition and pattern. Because of the limitations and uncertainties in the modeling outputs, our results should be carefully used in other studies or in decision-making. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Still, the interactive effects between them on plant nutrients remain unclear, hindering the precise prediction of fire effects at larger spatial scales. Here, we examined the effects of fire on aboveground biomass, as well as on carbon and nutrient concentrations, in a semiarid restored grassland (under grazing exclusion) on the Loess Plateau. We compared these effects between graminoid and forb, as well as at the total community level. The influence of slope aspect and slope position on these effects were also examined. Fire significantly increased the aboveground biomass of graminoid but did not affect that of forb. Fire significantly decreased the concentrations of most nutrients in aboveground biomass. Graminoid on the north-facing slope had higher dominance and aboveground biomass but lower nutrient concentrations than that on the south-facing slope. Forb on the north slope had similar aboveground biomass and nutrient concentrations but lower dominance than that on the south slope. Furthermore, the effects of fire on nutrient concentrations in graminoid varied with slope aspect, with more fire-induced decrease in nitrogen and potassium but less decrease in carbon on the north slope than that on the south slope. However, the effects of fire on nutrients in forb and in total community were not varied with slope aspect. Slope position had minimal effect on aboveground biomass and nutrient concentrations and their responses to fire. These results indicate that slope aspect and fire have interaCtive effects on plant nutrient concentrations in semiarid restored grasslands on the Loess Plateau, and thus should be considered when predicting nutrients cycling in grasslands.

Restoring soil nutrient stocks using local inputs, tillage and sorghum-green gram intercropping strategies for drylands in Eastern Kenya	HELIYON												Soil macronutrient and micronutrient availability is particularly critical in semi-arid agroecological zones that are characterized by poor soil fertility and low rainfall regimes. An experiment was initiated in Siakago, Embu County to investigate the effects of tied-ridges, conventional tillage and input applications on soil nutrient fertility using a randomized complete block design with a split-split plot arrangement for 4 seasons (2018-2021). The treatments comprised of two main plot tillage systems, three cropping systems allocated to the sub-plots and four soil input management treatments assigned to sub-sub plots. ANOVA was used to test the effects of different treatments including tillage, crop system and soil fertility management using Genstat software. The data was also subjected to Principal Component Analysis procedures using R ("FactoMineR" and "factoextra") to examine the inter-relationship patterns between different soil fertility parameters and to reduce the data into independent soil fertility components. There were significant main effects due to crop system (Soil Mn), tillage and crop system interaction (SOC and TSN) and soil fertility management (TOC, TSN, Ca, Zn). Soil inputs significantly influenced soil carbon concentrations (p = 0.002), with the lowest values observed in the control (0.2 %), followed by sole fertilizer (0.35 %), manure + fertilizer (0.41 %) and the fully decomposed manure treatment (0.61 %). The soil-extracted manganese values recorded significant effects due to crop system, while soil-extracted Zn values were significant due to soil fertility management. Multivariate analysis results revealed the structure of soil nutrient distribution. Tied ridging can improve soil micronutrient availability through reduced soil erosion, conservation of soil organic matter, which can improve soil micronutrient availability. Soil conservation practices such as tied-ridging integrated with organic input applications can enhance multiple nutrient availability for improved crop performance and human nutrition in dryland farming systems where farmers lack soil moisture, technologies and resources to enhance crop nutrient availability.

This study integrated a dynamic CO2 input method and an alternative freeze-thaw cycle function into Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to create a SWAT-Black Soil Region (SWAT-BSR) model. The SWAT-BSR model was used to simulate extreme climate events in the Liao River Basin (LRB; 220,000 km2) and an R script was developed to extract days in which extreme climate events occurred along with corresponding hydrological variables. Extreme climate events included extreme heat, cold, precipitation, and drought events across seven zones in the LRB. Subsequently, we explored the changes in single and integrated extreme climate events during the historical period (1971-2000) and future periods (2041-2070 and 2071-2100) under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP58.5 scenarios. The results indicated that almost each hydrological variable was reduced under extreme cold and drought events compared to the normal conditions in the historical period. Canopy interception and percolation were decreased under extreme heat in the future periods while extreme cold was opposite with a pronounced negative impact on reference evapotranspiration and soil evaporation. In contrast, each hydrological variable under extreme precipitation increased relative to the normal conditions while hydrological variables were largely negatively affected under extreme drought. In addition, the integrated extreme climate index increased over time, with more pronounced changes under the SSP5-8.5 scenario than those of SSP2-4.5 scenario. Hydrological variables were most at risk in the dryland zones as compared to partially irrigated and irrigated zones. These findings indicated that more attention should be given to the impacts of extreme climate events on water losses from both historical and future perspectives. It is also necessary to develop mitigation strategies for water conservation in the LRB based on the extreme climate events projected to occur in different zones and periods in the future.

The results showed that the mean soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK), and pH values were averaged at 12.64 g<middle dot>kg(-1), 0.84 g<middle dot>kg(-1), 23.20 mg<middle dot>kg(-1), 188.87 mg<middle dot>kg(-1), and 8.60, respectively. The nugget-to-sill ratios for the semi-variograms of SOM, TN, AP, and AK varied from 25.84 to 49.93%, while the coefficients of variation varied from 24.53 to 69.44%, revealing that all four indicators exhibited considerable variability, and that the samples' geographical variability was produced by a combination of random and structural factors. Overall increasing trends were exhibited from the middle to the northeast and southwest in the distributions of SOM, TN, and AP. The spatial distribution of AK displayed the opposite trend, increasing from the southwest to north and southeast. The texture of the tillage layer was the main factor directly affecting SOM, and explained 8% of its variation. The distribution of TN was mainly influenced by the irrigation method and water source type. AP and AK contents differed significantly between the two parent materials, three textures, and three topography types at the level of p < 0.01. In conclusion, the regional soil fertility was poor, spatial heterogeneity was moderate, and influencing factors were complex, highlighting the need to adopt precise fertilization management and adopting land management measures according to the actual influencing factors of each nutrient, thereby contributing to the enhancement of regional fertility.																				2073-4395				OCT	2023	13	10							2589	10.3390/agronomy13102589	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13102589													WOS:001099727300001

ACTA PHYSIOLOGIAE PLANTARUM												A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of elevated CO2 on groundnut growth, yield, kernel and haulm nutritional quality in the Open Top Chambers (OTC). Three regimes of CO2, ambient (380 ppm) and two elevated CO2 levels (550 and 700 ppm) are maintained in three different OTCs. Compared to the ambient CO2 conditions, the kernel yield per plant declined by 32.28% and 28.40% at 550 and 700 ppm, respectively, although the pod yield remained unaffected under elevated CO2. Under elevated CO2, plant height, specific leaf area, root area and root volume are reduced, while specific leaf weight increased because of leaf thickening. Root dry weight increased due to allocation of extra fixed carbon to roots for greater support to growth under CO2 enriched conditions. Haulm quality is reduced under elevated CO2, observed as reduced metabolizing energy and in-vitro organic matter digestibility at 550 ppm, and low ash and nitrogen content at 700 ppm. Kernel oil (6.54% and 2.98%) and protein content (7.07% and 4.56%) declined at 550 and 700 ppm as compared to ambient conditions, while fatty acid content remained unaffected. Among minerals, kernel iron and manganese content remained unaffected, while copper (13.93% and 26.19%) and calcium (24.33% and 8.20%) content declined at both elevated CO2 levels. The genotype by trait biplot analysis revealed ICGV 03043 as the best performing genotype with a superior trait profile alongside high kernel yield and oil content across three CO2 levels, making it a candidate for future studies to understand the insensitivity to elevated CO2.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of integrated farming systems on daily milk yield and demographic traits of dairy cows in drylands. A study conducted on 447 dairy cows was carried out to compare their milk yield and demographic parameters under different small-scale agroforestry systems in drylands of Benin: traditional silvopasture (TSS); Improved silvopasture (ISS); Small Integrated Agrosilvopasture (SIAS) and Large Integrated Agrosilvopasture (LIAS). The type of cattle farms had a significant effect (p < 0.05) on daily milk yield and demographic traits. Dairy cattle from ISS farms had the highest daily milk yield regardless of the type of dairy cow breed. Demographic traits of herds were significantly (p < 0.05) influenced by the type of dairy cattle farms. The proportion of lactating cows was higher (p < 0.05) in herds of ISS (48.4%) followed by those in TSS and LIAS (36.1 and 25.0% respectively) while SIAS was the lowest in (14.4%). The pre-weaning mortality rate was higher (p < 0.05) in TSS and LIAS farms (18.3 and 17.6 % respectively) compared to SIAS and ISS farms (5.20 and 4.60 % respectively). The fertility rate was higher (p < 0.05) in ISS and SIAS farms (92.3 and 89.6% respectively) compared to TSS and LIAS farms (68.3 and 74.2% respectively). The weaning productivity was higher (p < 0.05) in ISS and SIAS (88.6 and 85.8 % respectively) than in TSS and LIAS farms (66.1 and 67.6 % respectively). This study showed that ISS farms are characterized by higher milk yield and demographic parameters. ISS systems can then be promoted in smallholder cattle farming to improve milk production and reproductive performance of dairy cows in drylands.																				2571-581X				NOV 3	2023	7								1236581	10.3389/fsufs.2023.1236581	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1236581													WOS:001105938100001

Tillage practices influence winter wheat grain yield prediction using seasonal precipitation	FRONTIERS IN AGRONOMY												Making the best use of limited precipitation in semi-arid dryland cropping systems is important for crop production. Tillage practices may influence how this precipitation is utilized to predict winter wheat grain yield (Triticum aestivum L.). This study examined how tillage practices influence winter wheat grain yield prediction accuracy using precipitation received at three different periods of the season. Data were obtained from the period of 1972 to 2010 from a long-term tillage experiment. The study was designed as a winter wheat-fallow experiment. Each phase of the winter wheat-fallow rotation was present each year. The trial was set up as a randomized complete block design with three replications. Tillage treatments included no-till (NT), stubble mulch (SM), and moldboard plow (MP). Feed-forward neural network and multiple linear regression (ordinary least squares) were used to fit models under each tillage practice. No-till had the highest yield prediction accuracy with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.53 Mg ha(-1) and accounted for 81% of the variability in grain yield. Stubble mulch had an RMSE of 0.55 Mg ha(-1) and explained 73% of the variability in yield. Stubble mulch and NT were more accurate in yield prediction than MP which had an RMSE of 0.77 Mg ha(-1) and accounted for 53% of the variability in yield. The multiple linear regression model was less accurate than the feed-forward neural network model since it had at least 0.30 Mg ha(-1) more RMSE and accounted for only 5-8% of the variability in yield. Relative RMSE classified all neural network models as fair (21.6-27.3%) while linear regression models for the different tillage practices was classified as poor (33.3-43.6%), an illustration that the neural network models improve yield prediction accuracy. This study demonstrated that a large proportion of the variability in grain yield may be accounted for under NT and SM systems when using precipitation as predictors with neural networks.																				2673-3218				FEB 6	2023	5								1067371	10.3389/fagro.2023.1067371	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fagro.2023.1067371													WOS:001005851900001

People in rainfed and dryland areas are the most vulnerable to the environmental and social impacts of degradation, yet opportunities to expand agricultural areas in order to meet the needs of an ever-growing population are limited and/or not feasible. On the bright side, there are opportunities to avoid, reduce and reverse land degradation (LD), however, it will require identifying areas that are suited to implement sustainable land management (SLM) practices and create an enabling environment that encourages such initiatives. In Morocco, latest available data from 2015 showed that 19 percent of its land over the total land area is degraded. In order to assess the level of degradation in rainfed landscapes of Morocco and identify the appropriate technological solutions in response to the driving forces and pressures, and to come up with a territorial planning strategy, analyses were carried out at different levels to identify the land degradation "hot spots" as well as the SLM "bright spots." This paper sheds light on the decision support framework, co-developed with partners and applied in Morocco, the findings from national and subnational assessments of LD, as well as the process of participatory planning in selected communities of the Souss-Massa region for evaluation and scaling up of SLM good practices. The process led to the development of a "Territorial Planning Pact" as a tool for land use planning and a 3-year action plan to help decision-makers implement and mainstream SLM in the selected communities and guide similar processes throughout the region. The "Territorial Planning Pact" forms a base for planning and implementing the development program in the region led by key stakeholders. The paper presents the actions taken and concludes by highlighting the importance of integrating both biophysical and socio-economic information in a multi-level participatory process to identify the actions and responsibilities of various stakeholders and ensure sustainable management of limited natural resources and improved livelihoods for all.																				2571-581X				AUG 18	2022	6								848043	10.3389/fsufs.2022.848043	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2022.848043													WOS:000849125900001
J	Pringle, S; Chiweshe, N; Dallimer, M				Pringle, Stephen; Chiweshe, Ngoni; Dallimer, Martin			Increases in subsistence farming due to land reform have negligible impact on bird communities in Zimbabwe	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Habitat alterations resulting from land-use change are major drivers of global biodiversity losses. In Africa, these threats are especially severe. For instance, demand to convert land into agricultural uses is leading to increasing areas of drylands in southern and central Africa being transformed for agriculture. In Zimbabwe, a land reform programme provided an opportunity to study the biodiversity response to abrupt habitat modification in part of a 91,000 ha dryland area of semi-natural savannah used since 1930 for low-level cattle ranching. Small-scale subsistence farms were created during 2001-2002 in 65,000 ha of this area, with ranching continuing in the remaining unchanged area. We measured the compositions of bird communities in farmed and ranched land over 8 years, commencing one decade after subsistence farms were established. Over the study period, repeated counts were made along the same 45 transects to assess species' population changes that may have resulted from trait-filtering responses to habitat disturbance. In 2012, avian species' richness was substantially higher (+8.8%) in the farmland bird community than in the unmodified ranched area. Temporal trends over the study period showed increased species' richness in the ranched area (+12.3%) and farmland (+6.8%). There were increased abundances in birds of most sizes, and in all feeding guilds. New species did not add new functional traits, and no species with distinctive traits were lost in either area. As a result, species' diversity reduced, and functional redundancy increased by 6.8% in ranched land. By 2020, two decades after part of the ranched savannah was converted into farmland, the compositions of the two bird communities had both changed and became more similar. The broadly benign impact on birds of land conversion into subsistence farms is attributed to the relatively low level of agricultural activity in the farmland and the large regional pool of nonspecialist bird species.

Knowledge of their reservoir controlling properties, which today are missing, is important in view of potential geological storage of CO2 or natural gas and geothermal reservoir potential within these sandstones. Therefore the effects of diagenesis were assessed based on petrography, stable isotope analyses, fluid inclusion microthermometry, X-ray diffraction, electron microprobe and porosity-permeability core analyses. These sandstones were deposited by a dryland river system, in a warm, mostly arid climate with episodic rainfall and high evaporation rates. During wetter periods especially feldspars were dissolved. Strong evaporation during dry periods led to reprecipitation of the dissolved species as K-feldspar and quartz overgrowths, smectite and calcite/dolomite. Sediment reworking resulted in framework grains becoming clay coated. The clay coats are better developed in finer than in coarser grained sediments. The original smectite composing the rims converted to illite during burial. The tangential orientation of the clay platelets in the rims led to illite-mica-induced dissolution of quartz during burial/compaction, which is manifested as bedding parallel dissolution seams that are filled with clays and micas, especially in the fine-grained sandstone/siltstone/claystone. These constitute important barriers to the vertical flow within the reservoir. The released silica did not really affect the red sandstones but was exported ( often on mm to cm scale) to nearby bleached horizons, where nucleation inhibiting clay rims are less well developed. The red colour of the sandstones arises from the presence of small amounts of Fe-oxides in the inherited clay rims. Migration of fluids enriched in organic acids, expelled from underlying Carboniferous coalbearing strata, resulted in local bleaching of coarser grained horizons. In the finer grained sediments, the red colour was mostly preserved, which suggests that the reductive capacity of the fluid was limited.

In recent years, the impact of elevated O-3 on crop development and yield loss has emerged as one of the most important environmental issues, particularly in rural and suburban areas of the lower Indo-Gangetic Plains of India. The impact of the current tropospheric ozone (O-3) on the crop yield, photosynthetic yield, and enzymatic antioxidants of six rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars (IR 36, MTU 1010, GB 3, Khitish, IET 4786, and Ganga Kaveri) was investigated with and without the application of ethylenediurea (EDU). The results revealed that O-3 stress significantly affected crop yield, photosynthetic yield, and antioxidant enzymes. The findings showed that O-3 toxicity induces oxidative stress biomarkers, i.e., malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and was manifested by increasing the enzymatic antioxidants, i.e., superoxidase dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in four rice cultivars (IR 36, GB 3, IET 4786, and Ganga Kaveri). At the same time, the results also illustrated that the rice cultivars MTU 1010 and Khitish are more tolerant to O-3 stress as they had less oxidative damage, greater photosynthetic SPAD value, SOD and CAT activities, and lower MDA activity. The results also elucidated that the application of EDU decreased O-3 toxicity in sensitive cultivars of rice by increasing antioxidant defense systems. The current O-3 level is likely to show an additional increase in the near future, and the use of tolerant genotypes of rice may reduce the negative impacts of O-3 on rice production.

Nitrogen Availability and Use Efficiency in Wheat Crop as Influenced by the Organic-Input Quality Under Major Integrated Nutrient Management Systems	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Purpose One of the serious constraints for the integration of organics in soil fertility plans is the release and availability of nitrogen (N) to match the critical growth stages of a crop. The interplay between organic amendment characteristics and soil moisture conditions can significantly affect the nutrient release and availability, especially for dryland crops like wheat. In this study, the effects of integrated nutrient management strategies using diverse qualities of organic amendments on daily N mineralization and its availability to plants during the full growing season of the wheat crop were analyzed in a 10-year experiment. Methods The management included (1) F, inorganic fertilizers at 100% rate, compared to a reduced rate of inorganic fertilizers (55% N) supplemented with organic inputs via (2) GM, green manuring, (3) LE, legume cropping and its biomass recycling, (4) WS, wheat stubble retention, (5) RS, rice stubble retention, and (6) FYM, farmyard manure application, during the preceding rice season. Ion exchange resin (IER) membrane strips were used as plant root simulators to determine daily NH4+-N and NO3--N availability in soil solution during the full wheat growing period. Results Total available N for the full season was in the following order: GM (962 mu g cm(-2)) > F (878 mu g cm(-2)) > LE (872 mu g cm(-2)) > FYM (865 mu g cm(-2)) > RS (687 mu g cm(-2)) > WS (649 mu g cm(-2)). No significant differences were observed in NH4+-N availability throughout the cropping period as compared to NO3--N which showed significant differences among management at critical crop growth stages. Conclusion Legume biomass incorporation (GM, LE) and farmyard manure (FYM) based management provided the most consistent supply equivalent to or even exceeding 100% inorganic fertilizers at several critical stages of growth, especially at tillering and stem elongation. Integration of organics in management increased nitrogen use efficiency 1.3-2.0 times, with cereal crop residue-based management having the highest efficiency followed by legume biomass incorporation.																			1664-462X					MAY 19	2021	12								634448	10.3389/fpls.2021.634448	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.634448								34093604					WOS:000656940200001
J	Patil, KS; Gupta, SK				Patil, K. Sudarshan; Gupta, Shashi Kumar			Geographic patterns of genetic diversity and fertility restoration ability of Asian and African origin pearl millet populations	CROP JOURNAL												A set of 45 diverse Asian and African origin/bred populations of pearl millet were investigated multi-locationally for morphological traits including grain yield and assessed for their fertility restoration ability on three cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) systems in two contrasting seasons. Significant genetic variation was found for all the yield linked traits. Multivariate analysis for grain yield and its component traits grouped these populations into five clusters. Most of the Asian origin populations grouped into single cluster (Cluster III) and separated from the rest of the African origin populations indicating the presence of correspondence between clustering pattern and geographical origin of the populations. Clusters dominated with Asian populations (As-As) had linkages with early flowering, short plant height, more number of tillers, small and thin panicles, small seeded and low grain yield compared to the clusters dominated by African populations (Af-Af) or African origin and Asian bred (Af-As) populations. Genetically related populations having common parentage were found grouped in same clusters. Fertility restoration/maintainer frequency of 45 populations on three diverse CMS systems revealed that overall fertility restoration frequency was highest for A(1) (86%) followed by A(4) (37%) and for A(5) (7%) CMS system. Five populations were identified as potential sources for developing maintainer lines for all three CMS systems and eight populations were identified specifically for A(4) and A(5) CMS systems. A set of 11 and four populations were identified for restorer line development exclusively for A(1) and A(5) CMS system, respectively. Six populations were identified for the development of dual restorers for both A(1) and A(4) CMS system. (C) 2021 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS.

Trends in soil microbial communities in afforestation ecosystem modulated by aggradation phase	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Afforestation may alter soil microbial community structure and function, but its effects on trends of microbial abundance and activities has not been analyzed globally. The objectives of this study was to investigate how soil microbial community abundance and activities change as stand age increases and illustrate the factors affecting these changes after afforestation. We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis from 45 articles to evaluate global patterns and controls of soil microbial change following afforestation. Our results showed that during aggradation, all microbial biomass carbon (C-mic), microbial biomass nitrogen (N-mic), bacterial, and fungal abundance significantly increased during the early stage (0-10 years) but decreased for late-stage sites ( > 30 years). Microbial activities were also changed with stand age. In particular, C-mic: N-mic and microbial respiration to biomass ratio (R-mic:C-mic) significantly decreased during the late stages, but N-mic: Nitrogen (N-soil), microbial respiration (Rmic), and R-mic:C-mic significantly increased during the early stage. These trends high-lighted the importance of stand age in regulating the response of soil microbial abundance and activities to change. In addition, we found soil microbial community abundance was positively correlated with soil water content (SWC), pH, Bulk density (BD), C-soil, N-soil, and C-soil:N-soil, but negatively correlated P-soil, which suggested that the trend in soil properties following afforestation should be considered when implementing soil microbes as proxies of soil nutrients cycling. More importantly, response ratio of soil bacterial, fungi, and microbial community abundance was negatively correlated with response ratio of aridity index. This correlation indicated that the sensitivity of response ratio of microbial abundance to increases in precipitation can be greater in arid areas relative to humid areas. Overall, our findings highlight a broad understanding of the responses of microbial community abundance and activities to afforestation, which provides the background needed to form novel methods that accurately model ecosystem functions.

Therefore, the main aim of the current study is to clarify how different geometrical characteristics of streams in floodplains and piedmonts influence riparian vegetation distribution in arid ecosystems.MethodsIn this study, along the 10-m length and uniform cross-sections of streams, streams were separated into three main sections: (a) the stream valley and (b) the cross-sectional channel for the measurement of geometric parameters, (c) the riparian vegetation zone for the measurement of vegetation cover (%) and soil sampling in four geomorphic units. Moreover, based on the depth and width of the valley, streams were classified into small, medium, and large sizes. Furthermore, in different stream sizes, vegetation canopy was measured and the soil in riparian zones for moisture determination (%) and sediment in channels for grain size analysis were sampled.ResultsOur study revealed significant differences among geometrical parameters, vegetation canopy, sediment grain size, soil moisture content, and other soil characteristics of the different stream sizes in the study units (p < 0.05). The results showed the highest positive correlation between vegetation canopy and channel width and valley depth (r = 0.69, p < 0.01 and r = 0.61, p < 0.01, respectively) at all study sites. In addition, our study found that vegetation canopy was mainly positively correlated with stream width, sand, gravel, soil moisture, and the large stream size in the fine-grained geomorphic unit, particularly in piedmont B. In contrast, in the coarse-grained piedmonts, vegetation was more dependent on the medium stream size and soil moisture.ConclusionThe current study found that stream geometric parameters control soil quality for vegetation growth and affect vegetation distribution in this arid area.

J	Ogbolumani, OA; Nwulu, NI				Ogbolumani, Omolola A.; Nwulu, Nnamdi, I			A food-energy-water nexus meta-model for food and energy security	SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION												Optimal allocation of the food, energy and water (FEW) resources is of emergent concern owing to depleting supply of the natural resources. Increasing demand for the FEW resources is attributable to growing population, migration, economic development, technological advancements and climate change. The FEW nexus (FEW-N) is an intricate system that requires robust quantitative decision-making tools to investigate the links between the various system components and sustainability. This study proposes a meta model-based FEW-N system for addressing the issue of natural resource allocation for food and energy security. It incorporated an integrated model consisting of the Techno-Economic and Input/Output models in an Optimisation framework with maximum economic benefit as its objective function. The COIN -OR Branch and Cut (CBC) and CPLEX solvers in the Advanced Interactive Multidimensional Modelling System (AIMMs) were used to formulate and solve the optimisation problems. To validate the developed framework, the scenario analysis was performed on three cases in South Africa. First, it was found that using FEW resources for food production in dryland open fields, undercover greenhouses, and irrigated open fields was more profitable than for production of electrical energy from bioenergy, solar/wind-based hybrid renewable energy, and hydropower production systems. Second, the revenue of the sub-sector determined the percentage use of the FEW resources and the percentage contribution of technology options to food and energy security. Third, open fields, greenhouses, and irrigated open fields contributed significantly to food security. The holistic framework developed provided enhanced understanding of the FEW-N system. Resource security has significantly improved due to the ability of various technologies in each subsector to meet the food and energy demands of the specific population. Besides providing scientific support for national decisions regarding food, energy, and water policy, the proposed framework will also contribute to sustainable development at the subnational level.(c) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

J	Ma, YJ; Shi, FZ; Hu, X; Li, XY				Ma, Yu-Jun; Shi, Fang-Zhong; Hu, Xia; Li, Xiao-Yan			Threshold Vegetation Greenness under Water Balance in Different Desert Areas over the Silk Road Economic Belt	REMOTE SENSING												The sustainability of dryland vegetation growth over the Silk Road Economic Belt is under threat of water shortage, and the determination of water carrying capacity for vegetation is critically essential to balance water supply and water demand for the maintenance of existing ecosystems. To better understand how and why vegetation growth varies in different desert areas, this study first analyzed the spatiotemporal variation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Then, we investigated the relationship between NDVI and climatic factors (precipitation, soil water content, air temperature, evapotranspiration), and estimated the threshold NDVI under water balance in different desert areas. Results showed that the higher NDVI was mainly distributed in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Azerbaijan, and it increased in approximately 53% of desert areas from 1982 to 2015 in the whole study region. The mean annual NDVI showed a simultaneous increasing trend in all desert areas from 1982 to 1994, and decreased significantly only in the cold arid desert area (p< 0.01, -0.0067 decade(-1)) or had no significant change in other desert areas after 1994 (p> 0.01). The climate condition generally appeared as a warming and drying trend in the past 34 years, with varied changing rates in different desert areas. NDVI presented a strong positive relationship with both precipitation and evapotranspiration in most desert areas. The threshold values of the mean annual NDVI under water balance between 1982 and 2015 were approximately 0.1041 (hot arid desert), 0.1337 (cold arid desert), 0.1346 (cold arid semi-desert), 0.0951 (hot arid desert semi-desert), 0.0776 (polar desert tundra), 0.1071 (hot arid desert shrub), 0.1377 (cold arid desert steppe), and 0.0701 (polar desert steppe), respectively. The responses of these threshold values to precipitation were all positive in different desert areas. These results provide an enhanced understanding of vegetation dynamics and ecological conservation, which are of great importance to implementing adaptation and mitigation measures for terrestrial ecosystems over the Silk Road Economic Belt.

Here, abrupt changes in ecosystem functioning [so-called turning points (TPs)] were detected using time series of Earth observation data. Hotspot areas of high TP occurrence were identified, observed changes characterized and insights gained on potential drivers for these changes. Location Arid and semi-arid regions. Time period 1982-2015. Methods We used a time series segmentation technique (breaks for additive season and trend) to detect breakpoints in rain-use efficiency as a means of analysing changes in ecosystem functioning. A new typology to characterize the detected changes was proposed and evaluated, at regional to local scales, for a set of case studies. Ancillary data on population and drought were used to provide insights on potential drivers of TP occurrence. Results Turning points in ecosystem functioning were found in 13.6% (c. 2.1 x 10(6) km(2)) of global drylands. Turning point hotspots were primarily observed in North America, the Sahel, Central Asia and Australia. In North America, the majority of TPs (62.6%) were characterized by a decreasing trend in ecosystem functioning, whereas for the other regions, a positive reversal in ecosystem functioning was prevalent. Further analysis showed that: (a) both climatic and anthropogenic pressure influenced the occurrence of TPs in North America; (b) Sahelian grasslands were primarily characterized by drought-induced TPs; and (c) high anthropogenic pressure coincided with the occurrence of TPs in Asia and Australia. Main conclusions By developing a new typology targeting the categorization of abrupt and gradual changes in ecosystem functioning, we detected and characterized TPs in global drylands. This TP characterization is a first crucial step towards understanding the drivers of change and supporting better decision-making for ecosystem conservation and management in drylands.

Disentangling the interplay between species-specific environmental preferences and micro- and macroscale determinants of species abundance within plant communities remains challenging. Most existing studies addressing this issue either lack empirical data regarding species interactions and local abundances or cover a narrow range of environmental conditions. 2. We merged species distribution models and local spatial patterns to investigate the relative importance of key macro- (aridity) and micro(facilitation and competition)scale determinants of plant species abundance along aridity gradients in drylands world-wide. We used information derived from the environmental niches of species to evaluate how species-specific aridity preferences modulate the importance of such factors to drive species relative abundance. 3. Facilitation and aridity preferences were more important than competition to explain species local abundances in global drylands. The specialization of communities (i.e. their compositional shifts from species with a large range of aridity preferences towards only aridity specialists) also modulated the effect of aridity and plant-plant interactions on species abundances. The importance of facilitation to drive species abundances decreased with aridity, as species preferred arid conditions and did not need neighbours to thrive. Instead, competition showed stronger relationships with species abundances under high levels of aridity. As composition became dominated by aridity specialists, the importance of aridity in shaping dryland plant communities did not increase further from moderate to high aridity levels. 4. Synthesis. Our results showed that: (a) the degree of community specialization to aridity mediates the relative importance of plant-plant interactions in determining species abundances and (b) facilitation and competition were more strongly related to species abundance in communities dominated by generalists and specialists, respectively. We observed a shift from facilitation to competition as drivers of species abundances as aridity increases in global drylands. Our findings also pave the way to develop more robust predictions about the consequences of ongoing climate change on the assemblage of plant communities in drylands, the largest terrestrial biome.

Methods We conducted a glasshouse experiment that compared the performance of maize inoculated with living or sterilized soil inocula collected from experimental field plots with cropping histories of 1 to 5 years of continuous maize monoculture, where the soil type is Nicollet clay loam with moderate fertility. We measured the biomass, yield, root traits and leaf nutrients of maize as well as eukaryotic soil organisms. Results Inoculation with living soil dramatically reduced maize biomass and yield compared to inoculation with sterilized soil, showing CM to have strong negative soil biotic legacy effects on maize. Nonetheless, the strength of soil biotic effects on most maize variables were relatively stable over time under CM. The response of maize total biomass to living soil inoculation correlated positively with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal abundance but negatively with soil fauna abundance, whereas it did not relate with the abundance of plant pathogenetic fungi or herbivorous nematodes. The roots showed acquisitive syndromes (high specific root length but low root diameter) in sterilized soil but conservative syndromes (opposite traits) in living soil. The responses in root system structure were tightly related with AM fungal diversity and community composition. Conclusions Our study shows strong and stable negative effects of soil biota on maize under CM. The complex effects of soil biota on maize performance highlight the need to explore the functions of different groups of soil organisms to better understand and control negative soil legacy effects in agroecosystems.

Five treatments were designed as follows: no fertilizer (CK); 135 kg ha(-1)N and 90 kg ha(-1)P under straw mulching (SM); plastic mulching (PM); ridge-furrow with plastic film mulching (RFPFM) and green manure (GM). The results revealed thatActinobacteria(24%-33%), Proteobacteria(23.6%-33.4%), Acidobacteria(12.8%-18%) andFirmicutes(0.6%-3%) were the dominant phyla in different soil layers. The relative abundance (RA) ofActinobacteriain the surface soil layer (0-20 cm) of CK and GM (33.48% and 32.08%) was higher than that in the other treatments.Proteobacteriawas richer at 0-20 cm than at 20-40 cm in all treatments. The RA ofProteobacteriain RFPFM (33.43%) was significantly (p < .05) greater than that in the other treatments, and the RA ofFirmicutes(3.0%) in the RFPFM treatment at 20-40 cm was significantly (p < .05) greater.Chryseobacterium, Lactobacillus, BacillusandAltererythrobacterwere the dominant genera in PM, SM, GM and RFPFM, respectively.Solirubrobacterpreferred soil with stable aggregates and was the dominant genus in the control treatment. The findings of this study demonstrated that changes in soil bacterial RA and community composition were significantly affected by mulching treatment.

J	Wang, C; Zhao, WZ; Zhang, YY				Wang, Chuan; Zhao, Wenzhi; Zhang, Yongyong			The Change in Net Ecosystem Productivity and its Driving Mechanism in a Mountain Ecosystem of Arid Regions, Northwest China	REMOTE SENSING												During the past several decades, the carbon budget in the dryland ecosystem has experienced great variation under the joint impact of climate change and anthropogenic interference. How the net ecosystem productivity (NEP) responds to climate change and human interference in the Qilian Mountains (QLM), Northwest China, remains unclear. To fill these gaps, we first estimated the NEP in the QLM and then quantified the independent and interactive influences of natural environment factors, climatic factors, and human activity intensity on the NEP change from 2000 to 2020 by linking the Geodetector and structural equation models. The NEP of the QLM showed a significant increase during the recent 20 years, and 78.93% of the QLM experienced a significant increase in NEP; while only 4.83% of the area in the QLM experienced a decreasing trend, which is dominantly located on the southeast edge, surrounding the Qinghai Lake, and the midland of the QLM. The area percentage of the carbon sink region increased from 47% in 2000 to 62% in 2020. The natural environment factors (e.g., altitude and soil type) and climate factors (e.g., temperature and precipitation) were the dominant factors that determine the spatial distribution of NEP. Compared with a single factor, the interaction of pairs of factors enhanced the influence strength on NEP. The natural environment factors indirectly affected NEP change through influencing human activities intensity and climatic factors. Human activities intensity played a medium indirectly negative effect on NEP, while climatic factors exerted strong direct and indirect positive influences on NEP. The contributions of human activity intensity, climatic factors, and natural environment on NEP change in the QLM were 33.5%, 62.3%, and 38.3%, respectively. Overall, warming and wetting shifts in meteorological conditions offset the negative impact of human activities on NEP in the QLM, and the QLM has acted as a growing carbon sink in the past 20 years.						wang, chuan/0000-0003-0960-855X; Zhang, Yongyong/0000-0002-2084-5647														2072-4292				AUG	2022	14	16							4046	10.3390/rs14164046	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14164046													WOS:000846607700001

Surveys were carried out in Akcahisar, Cakmak, Gelibolu, Comlekci, Akpinar, Golpinar, Akziyaret, Bahceli, Golgen, Kizlar, Kulafli, Sakca, Karatas and Asik villages located about 25 km away from city centre on north-east direction in 2002, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 years. Villages were selected through purposive sampling method. Farmers in such villages were selected randomly. Each farmer was asked a 23- questions. The results revealed that crop rotation of wheat or barley in first year and the lentil in the following year tend to turn to be barley in first year and the lentil in second year. Farmers adopted newly released varieties with high yielding ability rapidly. Sowing time shifted from mid-November to mid-December. There was no constrains for tillage and sowing. Farmers were found to be sufficient for agricultural machinery. Seeding, fertilizer and weed management practices were adopted by farmers with the near ratios of recommended rates. Yellow rust (Puccinia striiformis), smut, (Ustilago spp.)powdery mildew (Eryciphe graminis) and bund (Tilletia spp.)diseases were given priority. Rodents and sunn pest (Eurigaster integricieps)were found to be most important pests. Harvest was performed by combine harvester totally. Average barley yield for all survey years (243.7 kg/da) higher than that of wheat was (225.35 kg/da). Average sale price for wheat for all survey years was 111.79 Kr/kg and that of barley was 96.81 Kr/kg. Climatological factors (26, 83%), high fertilizer input prices (21.57%) and low marketing prices (15.16%) were found to be major constrains for cereal cultivation. It was predicted that temperate cereal cultivation for incoming years will seriously be under risk due to huge fluctuations in annual rainfall and barley acreage will increase in future due to early maturing ability and the ability to escape from terminal drought.

These local-scale differences in tree cover patterns may result from limitations occurring at different plant development stages, such as seed germination, seedling establishment, tree growth rate and survival, all crucial for the maintenance and expansion of plant populations through natural regeneration. Holm oak (Quercus rotundifolia Lam.) is a key tree species in Mediterranean drylands. We aim at measuring the impact of microclimatic conditions on holm oak trees regeneration success using traits as indicators of adult tree performance in an average climatic year and tree's distribution pattern at the landscape level as an indicator of tree establishment success. We hypothesize that under contrasting microclimatic conditions, seedlings performance is limiting the regeneration potential of holm oak trees rather than adult trees physiological performance. To quantify the microclimatic conditions originated by topography, two indicators were used: i) Potential Solar Radiation, as the amount of potential solar energy reaching the site above tree canopy; and ii) functional lichen diversity, as ecological indicators of microclimatic conditions under the tree canopy. The performance of holm oak was assessed on 40 adult trees growing in contrasting microclimatic conditions (high and low Potential Solar Radiation sites). Several indicators based on leaf, tree and stand response traits, frequently used as ecological indicators to evaluate tree performance and susceptibility to drought stress, were selected: specific leaf area, leaf reflectance indices, tree size, tree growth rate, tree age and tree density. We found that leaf physiological performance was similar under contrasting microclimatic conditions. However, in areas with higher Potential Solar Radiation tree age and density were significantly reduced. These results suggest that microclimatic differences located in southern slopes with high Potential Solar Radiation are limiting for germination and sapling establishment. Thus, forest regeneration, restoration and nature conservation practices aiming at increasing forests resilience in Mediterranean dryland climates should account for the importance of microclimate in defining the niche of seedlings and of adult trees.

Clinical bovine theileriosis is mainly caused by T. annulata or T. parva but the clinical disease due to T. orientalis is rare. T. orientalis mainly infect RBCs and causes "Oriental theileriosis" or Theileria-associated bovine anaemia in cattle and other livestock species. Two genotypes of T. orientalis (Chitose and Ikeda) are reported to cause severe disease in some countries. In this report, a spontaneous outbreak of Oriental theileriosis was studied in an organized Holstein-Friesian cattle breeding farm situated in the south-eastern Himalayan ranges of Himachal Pradesh State of India. Animal blood and tick samples were tested using cytological and PCR techniques. The disease episode occurred in a protracted manner spanning over 10 to 12 months and association of T. orientalis was confirmed in 93.3% of the blood and 21.7% of Rhipicephalus microplus (tick) samples. No other tick borne pathogen was detected except Anaplasma marginale in two blood samples. Haematological profiling of infected cattle showed characteristic indicators of anaemia like haemoblobin, RBC count, haematocrit value and mean corpuscular volume at either lower than normal or near the lower normal range. The prevailing persistent anaemic changes led to more severe clinical manifestations like abortion and joint inflammation. The detected T. orientalis strains and ticks species were further confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis of 18S rRNA and 16S rRNA genes. Phylogenetically, T. orientalis strains showed clustering with other reported strains of T. orientalis from the surrounding regions. This first report of clinical Oriental theileriosis from India emphasises the importance of T. orientalis as an emerging tick borne pathogen and role of widely prevalent ticks species in disease transmission and their impact on livestock production.

The impact of N rate on soil water balance, soil nitrate N residue, grain yield, WUE, crop N recovery efficiency (REN), agronomic use efficiency of N fertilizer (AE), and net economic return were examined on maize production on the rainfed Loess Plateau during 2011-2018. Field treatments included four N application rates (NO, no N fertilizer applied; N100, 100 kg N ha(-1); N200, 200 kg N ha(-1); N300, 300 kg N ha(-1)). Results showed that compared with NO, grain yield increased by 56, 110, and 115% under N100, N200, and N300, respectively, with corresponding improvements in net economic return of 5497,10,878, and 11,088 RMB ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively; no significant difference was detected between N200 and N300. Compared to NO, N fertilization significantly increased WUE through improving photosynthetic WUE (i.e., transpiration efficiency), but there was no significant difference between N200 and N300. Compared to N100, the RE N was gradually decreased as N rates increased, AE was not significantly changed under N200 and significantly decreased under N300 due to a decreased leaf photosynthetic NUE. Compared to original soil water storage at 0-300 cm soil depths, after seven years of continuous experiments, treatment of NO enhanced soil water storage by 52 mm and treatment of N100 had no effect on soil water storage, but treatments of N200 and N300 depleted soil water storage by 73 and 109 mm, respectively. Our findings showed that 200 kg N ha(-1) improves WUE and NUE with less environmental cost and should be regarded as the economically optimal N rate on the semiarid western Loess Plateau of China for sustainable maize production.					liu, junyang/IXD-1252-2023; Yang, Ying/ADL-4165-2022; Li, Tao/IWU-9607-2023; wei, xiao/ISB-6027-2023; Li, Li/IAQ-0885-2023; yang, zhuo/JPK-3133-2023; zhang, lin/IZQ-4870-2023; liu, junyang/IXD-1201-2023; Liu, Yujie/IWU-6535-2023; li, li/GPX-3938-2022; Anwar, Sumera/O-3018-2019	Yang, Ying/0000-0002-3469-7681; Liu, Yujie/0000-0002-1153-6156; Anwar, Sumera/0000-0001-8224-7370; Wang, Linlin/0000-0001-5981-8833; Li, Lingling/0000-0003-3158-2501														2077-0472				NOV	2022	12	11							1799	10.3390/agriculture12111799	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12111799													WOS:000880699800001

To reduce cost of mapping, a digital soil mapping (DSM) approach might be useful. The purpose of this study was seeing if we could create DSM of the AWC at the field scale. In the first instance, digital data in the form of proximal sensed electromagnetic (i.e EM) and gamma-ray (gamma-ray) spectrometry data were collected along with elevation. Using a grid-based sampling design, 52 soil sample locations were selected and sampled; topsoil (0-0.3 m), subsurface (0.3-0.6 m) and subsoil (0.6-0.9 m). In the laboratory, the field capacity (FC) and permanent wilting point (PWP) were determined using a pressure plate apparatus. The digital and soil (i.e. FC and PWP) data were then calibrated with multiple linear regression (MLR) and stepwise-MLR models compared for each depth (e.g. adjusted coefficient of determination [adj-R-2]). The stepwise-MLR were shown to be superior. Subsequently, the DSM of FC and PWP were examined in terms of prediction agreement (Lin's concordance). Leave-one-out cross validation results showed substantial 1:1 agreement between measured and predicted FC (0.80) and PWP (0.79) at all depths. The final DSMs of FC and PWP, and by difference AWC, were indicative of the two main geomorphological/geological units, with large AWC ( 0.3 m(3) m(-3)) associated with the clay rich Vertosols and small AWC (< 0.15 m(3) m(-3)) the loamy soil of the Pilliga Sandstone. Owing to the short scale variation and the fact that the local alluvium and Pilliga Sandstone were close together and the fact that the digital data varied in different ways, larger confidence interval (CI) values were evident where these areas were juxtaposed. Nevertheless, the final DSM allows the farmer to better manage AWC.

M.; Liu, Boyang			Spatial-temporal distribution of winter wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) roots and water use efficiency under ridge-furrow dual mulching	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												In dryland agricultural production areas, knowledge on the growth and variation of winter wheat root systems under different mulching methods is important for guiding winter wheat production. We conducted a two-year field trial to explore the effects of different mulching practices on the spatial-temporal distribution of root growth, soil water storage, and grain yield. Four cultivation practices were tested: (i) traditional flat planting (CK), (ii) flat planting with half-film mulching (M1), (iii) ridge-furrow planting with film mulching over ridges only (M2), and (iv) ridge-furrow planting with film mulching over ridges and wheat straw mulching in furrows (M3). The results showed that the root diameter (RD), root length density (RLD), and root surface area density (RSD) of wheat under the four treatments were mainly concentrated in the 0-40 cm soil layer. The mean RLD in the 0-40 cm soil layer accounted for 62.2 %, 61.0 %, 59.3 %, and 55.8 % of the total root length density under M3, M2, M1, and CK, respectively, at maturity in both years. The M3 cultivation method produced the maximum values for RD, RLD, and RSD among all cultivation practices and the highest water storage efficiency after the three precipitation events. The M3 treatment had 11.1 %, 15.4 %, and 38.4 % higher mean grain yields than M2, M1, and CK, respectively, over the two-year study. Soil water storage had positive correlations with RD, RLD, and RSD. The RD, RLD, and RSD in the 0-40 cm soil layer had strong positive correlations with yield components, yield, aboveground biomass, and water use efficiency (WUE). Based on this study, ridge-furrow planting with film mulching over ridges and wheat straw mulching in furrows is an effective, sustainable cultivation method for wheat production in rainfed regions, which can increase the spatial-temporal distribution of root systems and soil water content across the root zones to increase crop production and WUE.

Therefore, planning for agricultural crops development, specifically rice, corn and soybean, must match levels of land suitability. This research aims to evaluate land suitability for rice (Oryza sativa), corn (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max) as a basis for food crop cultivation. The research is represented by a field study in the Magetan district of East Java, consisting of four action stages: (1) formulation of land units; (2) designation of observation points for the stratified proportional sampling of each land unit; (3) field survey; and (4) laboratory analysis. Land evaluation was made in accordance with: Land Evaluation for Rainfed Agriculture Guidelines. Results show that land suitability for rice is classified into the following categories: 37.2% highly suitable (S-1), 58.0% as moderately suitable (S-2) with soil depth and organic carbon soil content as limiting factors, and 4.8% as marginally suitable (S-3), with altitude and low organic carbon as limiting factors. Organic fertilizer from livestock can be applied to maintain and increase soil fertility. Land suitability for corn is classified as highly suitable (S-1) - 28.5%, moderately suitable (S-2) - 20.0%, with coarse materials and rocky outcrops as limiting factors, and marginally suitable (S-3) - 51.5%, with drainage, coarse materials, and surface rocks as limiting factors. For soybean, land is classified as highly suitable (S-1) - 24.3%, moderately suitable (S-2) - 20.4%, with coarse materials, pH, soil depth, surface rocks, and rocky outcrops as limiting factors, and marginally suitable (S-3) - 55.2%, with drainage, coarse materials, soil depth, surface rocks, and rocky outcrops as limiting factors. Corn and soybean can be cultivated on wetlands in the third planting season with a duration of 3 months. Rice, corn, or soybean crops can be grown on rainfed land using multiple cropping, or agroforestry systems between perennial crops.

JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES												The transition of farmers from subsistence to market-oriented agriculture is meant to reduce hunger, increase wellbeing and accelerate rural economic progress. While an impressive extant literature has analysed agricultural commercialisation effects on welfare from an income, expenditure and consumption perspective, authors place less attention on the implications on asset holdings, which is a more robust long-term measure of welfare. Using chickpea production in Ethiopia as a case, we assess the effects of chickpea commercialisation on household asset ownership and livestock holdings of smallholder farmers. We employ a household fixed-effects estimator to control for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity and account for possible endogeneity using an instrumental variable approach. For comparison purposes, we also evaluate the income effects of chickpea and examine impact heterogeneity using quantile regressions. Our results indicate a positive impact of agricultural commercialisation on assets, livestock ownership and income. We found commercialisation to benefit all farmers in terms of impact heterogeneity, though with higher gains for asset-rich households. Despite this rising asset inequality, we conclude that increased agricultural commercialisation can contribute to economic development of households and reduce rural poverty.

However, response of SIC to afforestation has been studied rarely, which hinders any prediction about soil carbon dynamics. To determine the response of SIC and soil organic carbon (SOC) to afforestation in semiarid soils and whether such responses vary with soil aggregates, soil texture, and climatic conditions, we measured SIC and SOC in bulk soils and aggregate fractions under paired afforested lands and farmlands at five sites across the Loess Plateau. The relationship of these responses to soils and climatic variables was analyzed. Afforestation increased SOC at all sites, with accumulation rates of 0.21, 0.23, 0.34, and 0.09 g kg(-1) yr(-1) in bulk soils, macroaggregates (>0.25 mm), microaggregates (0.25-0.053 mm), and silt + clay fraction, respectively, when averaged across sites and soil depths. However, the response of SIC to afforestation varied with site, with increased SIC in drier sites and decreased SIC in wetter sites. Change in SIC was negatively correlated with change in SOC either across or within bulk soils and aggregate fractions. The SIC decreased and SOC increased with increasing soil clay content, precipitation, temperature, and site aridity index. These results indicated consistent increase in SOC but variable response of SIC to afforestation among sites in the Loess Plateau. Such variable response of SIC should be incorporated into carbon cycle models to reduce uncertainties when predicting sequestration dynamics of soil carbon.

Based on cotton phenology and meteorological data from 79 agricultural weather stations in China between 1981 and 2017, the Pearson correlation, multi-variate linear regression and path analysis are applied to investigate the spatial and temporal changes of cotton phenological indices and climate variables (precipitation (P-re), sunshine duration (S-un), average (T-ave), minimum (T-min) and maximum temperatures (T-max), influence degrees of Pre, Sun, and Tave on phenology, and isolated effects of climate change and crop management on cotton phenology. The results showed that: (1) Emergence (Eme), squaring (Squ), flowering (Flo), and boll opening (Bol) dates of cotton advanced by 0.026-0.351 days year(-1), respectively. The cotton sowing (Sow) and maturity (Mat) dates were delayed by 0.170 and 0.337 days year-(1.) The average phenological stages from Sow-Eme, Squ-Flo, and Flo -Bol were shortened about 0.19-0.30 days year-(1,) Eme-Squ, Bol -Mat and the Sow-Mat were delayed by 0.11, 0.77, and 0.082 days year-(1,) respectively. (2) Pre had a positive effect on most of the lengths phenological stages of cotton except during Bol -Mat. The effect of Sun on the length of the various phenological stages of cotton was the opposite of that of P-re. T-ave, T-min, and T-max on the general negative effects on the length of the cotton phenological stages. (3) P-re, S-un, and T(av)e had different influence degrees on the cotton phenological stages because of different regional climate characteristics. (4) The impact of climate change on cotton phenology was weaker than crop management or combined effects of climate change and crop man-agement. Under the combined impacts, and isolated impact of crop management, the lengths of the stages from Sow-Eme and Squ-Flo were shortened while other phenological stages were extended. The isolated impact of climate change shortened the lengths of stages from Sow-Eme, Eme-Squ, and Flo -Bol, extended Squ-Flo, Bol -Mat, and Sow-Mat, implying that the longer-duration cotton varieties in a changing climate might be a better choice for planting. This could be a viable strategy for adapting to climate change. In addition, the study found that Seed cotton yield (Scy) decreased with the delay of Sow, Eme, Squ, Flo and Bol dates, increased with the increase of the lengths of Sow-Eme, Flo -Bol, Bol -Mat and Sow- Mat. And the change trend of Scy affected by climate change was less than that affected by crop man-agement or combined effects. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

PHYTOPARASITICA												Increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration expected in the near and distant future climate change scenario because of increasing emissions will change the quality of plant foliage which in turn effect the growth and development of herbivore insects. Feeding trials of Spodoptera litura Hub. for four successive generations were conducted by using the foliage of sunflower crop plants grown at four CO2 concentrations, 550 +/- 25 ppm (eCO(2)I), 700 +/- 25 ppm CO2 (eCO(2)II) and ambient CO2 (aCO(2)C), along with open field considered as 380 +/- 25 ppm (aCO(2)O). CO2 enrichment altered the biochemical constituents in sunflower foliage at both 30 & 60 days after sowing (DAS) and had lower nitrogen (20-23 %), protein (12-13 %) and aminoacid contents (15-25 %) with increased carbon (18-21 %) C: N ratio (59-65 %), carbohydrates (16-18 %) and tannins (22-25 %) compared to ambient CO2. The total consumption of sunflower foliage by S. litura larvae was significantly higher (15-62 %) with increased larval weights (5-17 %), lower relative growth rate (12-18 %) and lower food conversion efficiencies (21-34 %) at both levels of eCO(2) over ambient during four successive generations. Biochemical midgut analysis of S. litura larvae fed on sunflower foliage of eCO(2) levels indicated the lower esterase activity, proteins and aminoacids over ambient. Strong association was noted between biochemical constituents of sunflower foliage and insect parameters at two levels of eCO(2). The findings corroborate the host-mediated effect of eCO(2) on growth and development of S. litura on sunflower and imply that the pest activity may likely increase in future climate change scenario.																			0334-2123	1876-7184				APR	2022	50	2					319	333		10.1007/s12600-021-00964-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12600-021-00964-2		JAN 2022											WOS:000745587700001

Conservation tillage is known to optimize soil structure, improve microbial community diversity and increase SOC storage. However, how soil aggregate distribution and microbial community structure and function within aggregates affect SOC transformation under long-term conservation tillage remains unclear. In this study, SOC mineralization dynamics were studied in situ and under laboratory conditions to examine the mechanisms by which C functional genes within soil aggregates of different sizes (i.e., mega-, macro-, and micro-aggregates) influence SOC mineralization under long-term tillage (i.e., zero, chisel, and plow tillage) in a dryland. The results indicated that in the winter wheat and summer maize rotation cropping system, SOC-derived CO2-C emissions were 143.99 and 133.29 g CO2-C m(-2) h(-1) lower under chisel and zero tillage than that under plow tillage, respectively. Moreover, after 180 days of laboratory incubation, SOC mineralization in micro- and macro-aggregates was 1.98 and 1.63 mg CO2-C g(-1) d(-1) higher than that in mega-aggregates, respectively. The aggregate-associated differential modules of bacterial co-occurring networks may be directly governed by bacterial community diversity and composition, which might play critical roles in driving SOC mineralization in response to different tillage intensities. Moreover, aggregate-associated functional genes involved in labile and recalcitrant C compositions, which were determined by shotgun metagenomic sequencing, were associated with SOC mineralization and were significantly affected by the legacy effect of tillage intensity and aggregate size. Particularly, partial least squares path modeling revealed that genes involved in simple sugar metabolism exerted significantly positive effects on SOC mineralization, except for the effects of tillage intensity and aggregate size. Overall, this study showed that decreased abundances of labile C decomposition-related functional genes within aggregates and community composition changes, as elucidated by the differences in bacterial network modules, under conservation tillage inhibit SOC mineralization. These findings may help in the development of adaptive soil tillage strategies for reducing carbon emissions in agroecosystems.

Though widely distributed historically, it has been sparsely reported from several regions of central and northern states in India till twentieth century. Later, the species distribution became confined only to the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, which have had reported sightings in the twenty-first century. In order to highlight the potentially suitable habitats for Asiatic caracals in India, we targeted forth-filtering of the spatial model ensemble by creating and utilizing the validated and spatially thinned species presence information (n =69) and related ecological variables (aridity, NDVI, precipitation seasonality, temperature seasonality, terrain ruggedness), filtered with anthropological variable (nightlight). Results: Out of eight spatial prediction models, the two most parsimonious models, Random Forest (AUC 0.91) and MaxEnt (AUC 0.89) were weighted and ensembled. The ensemble model indicated several clustered habitats, covering 1207.83 km(2) areas in Kachchh (Gujarat), Aravalli mountains (Rajasthan), Malwa plateau (Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh), and Bundelkhand region (Madhya Pradesh) as potentially suitable habitats for caracals. Output probabilities of pixels were further regressed with converted vegetation height data within selected highly potential habitats, i.e., Ranthambore Kuno Landscape (RKL) (suitability similar to 0.44 +/- 0.03(vegetation height)**, R-2 = 0.27). The regression model inferred a significant positive relation between vegetation height and habitat suitability, hence the lowest ordinal class out of three classes of converted vegetation height was masked out from the RKL, which yielded in an area of 567 km(2) as potentially highly suitable habitats for caracals, which can be further proposed as survey areas and conservation priority areas for caracals. Conclusion: The study charts out the small pockets of landscape in and around dryland protected areas, suitable for caracal in the Indian context, which need attention for landscape conservation.

J	Adhikari, B; Wang, LX				Adhikari, Bishwodeep; Wang, Lixin			The potential contribution of soil moisture to fog formation in the Namib Desert	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Fog is considered as an important source of water in many drylands, and the knowledge of possible sources of its formation is essential to make future predictions. Prior studies have suggested the presence of locally generated fog in drylands; however, its formation mechanism remains unclear. There have been studies on the effects of fog on soil moisture dynamics. On the contrary, no research has yet been conducted to understand the potential contribution of soil moisture to fog formation. This study, therefore, for the first time intends to examine such possibility in a fog-dominated dryland ecosystem, the Namib Desert. The study was conducted at two sites representing two different land forms (sand dunes and gravel plains) in the Namib Desert. We first examined evidence of fog formation through water vapor movement using field observations, and then simulated water vapor transport using HYDRUS-1D model. In the first part of the study, soil moisture, soil temperature and air temperature data were analyzed, and the relationships between these variables were taken as one of the key indicators for the linkage between soil water and fog formation. The analysis showed that increase in soil moisture generally corresponded to similar increase in air or soil temperature near the soil surface, which implied that variation in soil moisture might be the result of water vapor movement (evaporated soil moisture) from lower depths to the soil surface. In the second part of the study, surface fluxes of water vapor were simulated using the HYDRUS-1D model to explore whether the available surface flux was sufficient to support fog formation. The surface flux and cumulative evaporation obtained from the model showed positive surface fluxes of water vapor. Based on the field observations and the HYDRUS-1D model results, it can be concluded that water vapor from soil layers is transported through the vadose zone to the surface and this water vapor likely contributes to the fog formation in fog-dominated drylands, like the Namib Desert.

Subsoiling increases grain yield, water use efficiency, and economic return of maize under a fully mulched ridge-furrow system in a semiarid environment in China	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												After widespread application of the fully mulched ridge-furrow system, maize (Zea mays L.) has become a newly dominant crop in the semiarid Loess Plateau of China. Maximization of water use efficiency (WUE) through optimal farming practice are of great importance for sustainable intensification of maize production in this region. In this study, the impact of different tillage practices on soil quality, soil water, grain yield, WUE, and net economic return in a fully mulched ridge-furrow system were examined in a five-year field experiment, to optimize tillage practice for maize production in the area. Four tillage practices (CT, conventional tillage; NT, no-tillage; RT, rotary tillage; SS, subsoiling) were assessed. Compared to CT, SS reduced soil bulk density and penetration resistance, and increased saturated hydraulic conductivity and the percentage of macro-aggregates (>= 0.25 mm) in the 0-30 cm soil layers, but NT and RT had the opposite effects to above soil physical properties except for macro-aggregates. Tillage practice did not significantly affect soil water storage, evapotranspiration, but annual soil water balance was lowest under SS, followed by CT, NT, and RT. SS increased soil organic C, mineral N and available P at 0 - 30 cm soil layer compared to CT. Grain yield and WUE under SS were increased by 12 and 15 % compared to CT, NT and RT had no significant effect on grain yield and WUE. Net economic return under NT and SS were increased by 42 and 23 % respectively compare to CT. These results demonstrated that subsoiling could improve grain yield, WUE, and net economic return of dryland maize by improving soil quality and mitigating soil water depletion. In the long-run, although no-tillage increased net economic return, it may not be sufficient to maintain yield and WUE due to deteriorated soil properties and accelerated soil water depletion. Thereby, subsoiling is optimal tillage practice for sustainable intensification of maize production in the semiarid Loess Plateau of China.					li, li/GPX-3938-2022; li, li/HII-4157-2022; Li, Donglin/JEF-4284-2023; LI, LI/GVS-5344-2022; Li, Li/AEM-3636-2022	li, lin/0000-0002-8014-8296; Wang, Linlin/0000-0001-5981-8833													0167-1987	1879-3444				MAY	2020	199								104584	10.1016/j.still.2020.104584	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2020.104584													WOS:000521110000020

Adding biochar is a potential strategy to enhance root growth and consequently increase crop productivity. In this study, we investigated the effects of adding biochar at 0.0 t ha(-1 ), 4.5 t ha(-1 ), and 9.0 t ha(-1 ) on the growth and activity of roots, yield, and water and nitrogen use efficiency in spring maize under fiat planting without film and ridge-furrow planting with film mulching. Adding biochar increased the root length density in spring maize by 7.1-13.8 %, root dry weight density by 4.8-9.2 %, root surface area density by 6.7-13.8 %, and root sap bleeding rate by 7.1-18.9 %, where the effects increased as the biochar application rate increased. Compared with fiat planting without film mulching, the effect of adding biochar on the growth and activity of roots was more significant under ridge-furrow film mulching (P < 0.05), especially with biochar applied at 9.0 t ha(-1 ). Ridge-furrow planting with film mulching and adding biochar at 9.0 t ha(-1 ) increased the spring maize yield by 28.3 % and water use efficiency by 40.0 %. This method also increased the total nitrogen content of plants by 25.8 %, reduced the mineral nitrogen residue level in the 0-200 cm soil layer during the harvest period by 35.0 %, and increased the nitrogen use efficiency by 34.9 %. Therefore, the combination of ridge-furrow film mulching and adding biochar at 9.0 t ha(-1 )can be used as an efficient soil management practice for improving the utilization of water and nitrogen to possibly improve yields and facilitate the efficient utilization of resources in dry farmland areas of the Loess Plateau.

J	Chen, C; Fletcher, A; Ota, N; Oliver, Y; Lawes, R				Chen, Chao; Fletcher, Andrew; Ota, Noboru; Oliver, Yvette; Lawes, Roger			Integrating long fallow into wheat-based cropping systems in Western Australia: Spatial pattern of yield and economic responses	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												CONTEXT: Long fallow, once a common management practice in the low-rainfall of Mediterranean-type envi-ronments, may provide growers with an opportunity to switch cropping sequence and reduce the risk of yield and income losses during the recent drought period. However, such benefits are usually not uniform across a spatially variable environment. It is important to identify where long fallow would have a role in increasing crop yield and economic return. OBJECTIVE: To examine the spatial pattern of yield and economic performance of integrating long fallow into a wheat cropping system in dryland Mediterranean environments of Western Australia. METHODS: The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) driven by 0.05 degrees gridded climate over the dry period of 1990-2020 was used to simulate five rotations (fallow followed by one, two, three or four wheat crops, respectively) and continuous wheat. With offset simulations, simulated wheat yields, plant available water at sowing after a wheat crop or long fallow and N fertilizer requirement were compared and analysed for fallow -wheat and wheat-wheat. Wheat yields and economic returns were also calculated for each rotation and compared with continuous wheat.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Wheat yield and economic responses to long fallow showed clear geographic patterns that increased from the south-west to north-east across the wheatbelt, which could be explained by climate and soil conditions. Yield increase from fallow could be >6%, equivalent to 13% of economic increase, in the areas where growing season rainfall was <230 mm and the difference in plant available soil water at sowing between fallowed and continuously cropped soil was >30 mm. Although fallow resulted in overall reduction in crop production, integrating one fallow into a continuous wheat sequence every three or more years might achieve similar profit to continuous wheat for fields with weeds and diseases challenges in the north-eastern wheatbelt.SIGNIFICANCE: The results of yield and economic performance after fallow in the context of space and crop sequence provide a systematic analysis to map where and how fallow could be adopted into cropping systems.

It is an important grain after wheat, but little is known about its water requirements and, most importantly, how it responds to water stress. Determining when water stress sets in and how malt barley responds to water deficit during its growing season is crucial for improved management of crop water requirements. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the response of transpiration (T), stomatal conductance (SC), and leaf water potential (LWP) to water stress for different growth stages of malt barley and to characterise water stress to different levels (mild, moderate, and severe). This was achieved by monitoring the water stress indicators (soil- and plant based) under greenhouse conditions in well-watered and water-stressed lysimeters over two seasons. Water stress was characterised into different levels with the aid of soil water content 'breaking points' procedure. During the first season, at the end of tillering, flag leaf, and milk/dough growth stages, which represent severe water stress, plant available water (PAW) was below 35%, 56%, 14%, and 36%, respectively. LWP responded in accordance to depletion of soil water during the growing season, with the lowest recorded value to -5.5 MPa at the end of the milk/dough growth stage in the first season. Results also show that inducing water stress resulted in high variability of T and SC for both seasons. In the second season, plants severely stressed during the anthesis growth stage recorded the least total grains per pot (TGPP), with 29.86 g of grains. The study suggests that malt barley should be prevented from experiencing severe water stress during the anthesis and milk/dough stages for optimum malt barley production. Quantification of stress into different levels will enable the evaluation of the impact of different levels of stress on the development, growth, and yield of barley.

However, the spatial variation of soil physical properties and its relationship with plant productivity in degraded slopes is not yet fully understood. Materials and methods In this study, three parallel downslope transects were built on a typical degraded slope in the dry-hot valley of Jinsha River, and soil physical properties (including soil particle size, bulk density (BD), total porosity (TP), capillary porosity (CP), noncapillary porosity (NP), saturated water capacity (SWC), capillary water capacity (CWC), field water capacity (FWC), and hydraulic conductivity (Ks)) at two soil depths (0-10 cm and 10-20 cm) and plant biomass (reflected by aboveground biomass) were measured. Results and discussion The results indicated that the sand content, TP, NP, SWC, CWC, and Ks increased firstly and then decreased, while the silt content and BD decreased firstly and then increased from upper slope to lower slope. Plant biomass was only observed in middle and lower slopes, and that in the lower slope was decreased significantly to slope foot. Slope position and soil depth had significant effects (P < 0.05) on soil physical properties, indicating that topography and soil depth play a key role in driving the spatial variation in soil physical properties. Simple linear regression analysis showed that Ks, sand, and silt content are the key soil indicators affecting plant growth, and the soil layer differences in BD, CWC, and FWC are also the important factors affecting plant productivity. Conclusions Our findings highlight the spatial variation of soil physical properties, and plant biomass is attributed to the interactions of topography-soil-plant, which is critical for the healthy function of degraded slopes. Such findings provide an important basis for ecological restoration and management in degraded regions.

Common and unique rhizosphere microbial communities of wheat and canola in a semiarid Mediterranean environment	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												In wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-based cropping systems, rotation crops often provide a yield benefit to the following wheat crop. This has been documented for legume crops and canola (Brassica napus L.). In the present study, we examined bacterial and fungal communities in the rhizosphere of wheat and canola at six paired locations on fall and spring sampling dates using high-throughput sequencing of marker genes (bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal internal transcribed spacers). Soil type was the primary driver of both fungal and bacterial communities, with the communities of locations geographically closest, and with the same soil type, clustering together. Season (fall vs spring sampling) had the next strongest effect, followed by the crop species. Differences between the wheat and canola were more evident in the spring than in the fall. However, in contrast, bacterial and fungal species richness and diversity were not related to location or season, and instead were consistently higher in the rhizosphere of canola compared to wheat. Many bacterial groups were shared across both crop species, especially Janthinobacterium and Kaistobacter. Bacterial communities of wheat in the fall were dominated by Actinomycetes and Acidobacteria. But in the spring, these communities shifted to fast growing bacterial copiotrophs, including Pseudomonas, Janthinobacterium, Flavobacterium, Oxalobacteraceae, and Sphingobacteriaceae. Saprotrophic fungi such as Ulocladium, Mortierella, Cryptoccocus, Chaetomium, Penicillium and Trichoderma were also common to, and equally abundant in, the rhizosphere of both crops. Potential wheat root pathogens such as Thanatephorus (Rhizoctonia) Ceratobasidium, Oculimacula, Typhula, and Microdochium were more abundant in the wheat rhizosphere compared to canola. In conclusion, most of the communities of fungi and bacteria are not "host specific" but colonize the roots of both wheat and canola with differing relative abundance dependent on the season. A much smaller group of taxa were unique to the specific crop. This work provides novel insight into changes in crop rhizosphere communities when canola is introduced into dryland monoculture wheat cropping systems.

J	Sabir, A; Sari, G				Sabir, Ali; Sari, Gamze			Zinc pulverization alleviates the adverse effect of water deficit on plant growth, yield and nutrient acquisition in grapevines (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.)	SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE												Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) is an important dryland pulse crop in many parts of the world. However, productivity and quality are often limited by periods of water deficit. In a number of drought regions, drought is accompanied with zinc (Zn) deficiency, one of the most serious problems causing significant decreases in yield and quality in viticulture. In spite of this fact, possible effect of Zn treatment to alleviate the adverse effect of water stress on grapevines has not been studied. A pot culture research was designed under controlled glasshouse condition with the objective to investigate the effects of Zn pulverization on growth, physiology and nutrient acquisition of grapevine cultivars 'Italia' and 'Alphonse Lavallee' subjected to different irrigation levels. Six years old grapevines of the cultivars grafted on a drought tolerant rootstock Richter 99 (Berlandieri x Rupestris) were cultivated in pots (70 L) and subjected to two different irrigation regimes, FI-100% (replenishing the substrate water storage up to field capacity) and DI (40% of FI). Half of the vines for each irrigation group received leaf Zn pulverization (1%) twice (prior to flowering and berry set). DI caused overall decreases in shoot and leaf developments of cultivars, while Zn pulverization had alleviating effects on such vegetative growth in general. Generally, leaf chlorophyll content of the vines was also improved by Zn under both FI and DI conditions. Spraying of the leaves and green bunches with chelated Zn supported the grapevines of both cultivars 'Italia' and 'Alphonse Lavallee' in varying degrees by improving acquisition of many plant nutrients, promoting the vegetative and generative developments. Considering the overall response of the vines to Zn pulverization with a particular concern to DI condition, improved shoot and leaf growth, greener leaves, enhanced berry development and vine yield allow us to recommend Zn spraying as an environmentally friendly and sustainable cultural practice under drought stress which has been increasing with global climate change.

J	Yang, XF; Zhang, YM; Liang, JQ; Zhang, XC				Yang, Xiaofeng; Zhang, Yimeng; Liang, Jianqiang; Zhang, Xingchang			Effect of Soil Configuration on Alfalfa Growth under Drought Stress	SUSTAINABILITY												This paper aims to compare the effect of different soil configurations on plant growth under long-term drought to provide a theoretical basis for soil reclamation and vegetation restoration in the contiguous area between Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Inner Mongolia, China. With the widely distributed montmorillonite-enriched sandstone in this area as the soil structure ameliorator and the sandy soil as the test soil, indoor simulation and soil column tests were conducted to study the water holding capabilities of different reconstructed soils configurations. The drought stress test of alfalfa on these soils explored the correlation between the growth of alfalfa and soil water in various configurations. The soil-water characteristic curve and soil texture were analyzed to determine plant survival. The results showed that the addition of montmorillonite-enriched sandstone with high water holding capacity and water diffusion rates could increase the water content of the sandy soil. The treatments with 20 and 30 cm montmorillonite-enriched sandstone at the depths of 20-40 cm and 20-50 cm demonstrated the longest survival time (60 days and 59 days), the highest germination (34% and 35%), and the highest water holding capacity (22.6% and 27.3%), indicating that soils with higher water holding capacity and lower diffusion rates could be used as a reservoir, in combination with other soil materials with high water content, and that the addition of the montmorillonite-enriched sandstone layer at 20-30 cm in the sandy soil is the optimal choice for topsoil reclamation in open-mining areas.																				2071-1050				MAR	2023	15	6							5400	10.3390/su15065400	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15065400													WOS:000958377300001

Pers.] ecotypes for adaptation to environmental heterogeneity	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												IntroductionIt is well known that different ecotypes adopt different mechanisms to survive under environmental stress conditions. In this regard, each ecotype showed different type of modifications for their existence in a specific habitat that reflects to their ecological success. MethodsHere, differently adapted ecotypes of Bermuda grass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] were collected to evaluate their differential structural and functional modifications that are specific to cope with environmental stress conditions. The soil that adheres ecotypes roots were highly saline in case of DF-SD (Derawar Fort-Saline Desert), UL-HS (Ucchali Lake-Hyper Saline) and G-SSA (Gatwala-Saline Semiarid) ecotypes. Soils of S- HS (Sahianwala-Hyper Saline), S-SW (Sahianwala-Saline Wetland) and PA-RF (Pakka Anna-Reclaimed Field) were basic (pH 9 to 10). Soils of UL-HS and PA- HS (Pakka Anna-Hyper Saline), KKL-S (Kalar Kahar Lake-Saline), BG-NS (Botanic Garden-Non Saline) and G-SSA were rich in organic matter, and soil of BG-NS and DF-SD were rich in minerals. Anatomical modifications were performed by using the free hand sectioning technique and light microscopy. Results and DiscussionDF-SD is one of the best ecotypes which showed anatomical modifications to cope with environmental changes. These modifications included stem cross-sectional area and leaf sheath thickness that contribute towards water storage, vascular tissues for proficient translocation of solutes and trichomes that provide resistance to water loss. On the other hand, sclerification in root is the only notable modification in the Gatwala Saline Semiarid (G-SSA) ecotype from saline arid habitat where rainfall is not as low as in the Cholistan Desert. Two ecotypes from hyper-saline wetlands, UL-HS and KL-HS showed increased number and size of vascular tissue, central cavity and sclerification in stem which are important for solutes conduction, water loss and salts bulk movement, respectively. The ecotype from reclaimed site was not much different from its counterpart from hyper-saline dryland. Overall, anatomical modifications to maintain water conservation are key mechanisms that have been identified as mediating stress tolerance in C. dactylon ecotypes.

J	Gao, X; Zhao, DS				Gao, Xuan; Zhao, Dongsheng			Spatial and Temporal Variability of Key Bio-Temperature Indicators and Their Effects on Vegetation Dynamics in the Great Lakes Region of Central Asia	REMOTE SENSING												Dryland ecosystems are fragile to climate change due to harsh environmental conditions. Climate change affects vegetation growth primarily by altering some key bio-temperature thresholds. Key bio-temperatures are closely related to vegetation growth, and slight changes could produce substantial effects on ecosystem structure and function. Therefore, this study selected the number of days with daily mean temperature above 0 degrees C (DT0), 5 degrees C (DT5), 10 degrees C (DT10), 20 degrees C (DT20), the start of growing season (SGS), the end of growing season (EGS), and the length of growing season (LGS) as bio-temperature indicators to analyze the response of vegetation dynamics to climate change in the Great Lakes Region of Central Asia (GLRCA) for the period 1982-2014. On the regional scale, DT0, DT5, DT10, and DT20 exhibited an overall increasing trend. Spatially, most of the study area showed that the negative correlation between DT0, DT5, DT10, DT20 with the annual Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) increased with increasing bio-temperature thresholds. In particular, more than 88.3% of the study area showed a negative correlation between annual NDVI and DT20, as increased DT20 exacerbated ecosystem drought. Moreover, SGS exhibited a significantly advanced trend at a rate of -0.261 days/year for the regional scale, while EGS experienced a significantly delayed trend at a rate of 0.164 days/year. Because of changes in SGS and EGS, LGS across the GLRCA was extended at a rate of 0.425 days/year, which was mainly attributed to advanced SGS. In addition, our study revealed that about 53.6% of the study area showed a negative correlation between annual NDVI and LGS, especially in the north, indicating a negative effect of climate warming on vegetation growth in the drylands.

This study investigated the effects of mulched plastic film and residual plastic film on the PAE concentrations in the soil-crop system and assessed the risks to people eating crop products. The PAEs concentration in the 0-25 cm soil layer of plastic mulched farmland was 0.45-0.81 mg/kg, while the average PAEs concentration of 0.37-0.73 mg/kg in non-mulched farmland decreased by 19%. The PAEs concentration in mulched soil reached the highest in July, being 0.80-0.84 mg/kg, while in the non-mulched soil, the PAEs also appeared and gradually decreased from May at 0.62-0.74 mg/kg to October, and the PAEs concentrations were almost the same in the mulched and non-mulched soils at the harvest time in October at 0.37-0.44 mg/kg. With the amounts of residual film in farmland increasing from 0 kg/ha to 2700 kg/ha (equivalent to the total amount of residual film after 60 years of continuous plastic film mulching), the PAEs concentrations were no significant changes, being 0.54-0.93 mg/kg. Maize (Zea mays L.) roots could absorb and accumulate PAEs, and the bio-concentration factor (BCF) was 1.6-2.3, and the average PAEs concentrations in stems, leaves, and grains were 79%-80% of those in roots at 0.77-1.47 mg/kg. For the ingestion of maize grains or potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tubers grown in plastic film mulched farmland or farmland containing residual film of 450-2700 kg/ha, the hazard index (HI) were less than 1, the carcinogenic risks (CRs) were 2.5 x 10(-7)-2.2 x 10(-6), and the estrogenic equivalences were 6.17-17.73 ng E-2/kg. This study provides important data for the risk management of PAEs in farmlands.

J	Lu, TP; Wang, XJ; Zhang, WX				Lu, Tongping; Wang, Xiujun; Zhang, Wenxi			Total and dissolved soil organic and inorganic carbon and their relationships in typical loess cropland of Fengu Basin	GEOSCIENCE LETTERS												There is evidence of connections between soil organic carbon (SOC) and inorganic carbon (SIC) in dryland of north China. However, fractions of SOC and SIC and the relationship are not well understood in the Loess Plateau that undergoes profound erosion and redeposition. A study was conducted in low-elevation cropland of Loess Plateau across two distinctive basins: Linfen basin (LFB) with lower soil pH (< 8.4) and subject to erosion-redeposition, and Yuncheng basin (YCB) with higher soil pH (> 8.6) and under the influence of the Yellow River. Soil samples were collected from 30 sites over 100 cm. We determined SOC, SIC, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and other properties. Above 100 cm, SOC stock is significantly higher in LFB (10.0 +/- 2.6 kg C m(-2)) than in YCB (6.9 +/- 1.5 kg C m(-2)), but SIC lower in LFB (14.0 +/- 2.5 kg C m(-2)) than in YCB (17.0 +/- 5.7 kg C m(-2)). We find a significantly negative correlation between SOC and SIC stocks in LFB, but no clear relationship in YCB. DOC:SOC ratio (an indicator for DOC desorption or SOC stability) is significantly higher below 40 cm in YCB (1.9%) than LFB (1.2%), indicating stronger DOC desorption in YCB that has stronger hydrological process due to the influence of the Yellow River. Overall, SOC has a negative correlation with SIC and soil pH, and DOC:SOC ratio has a significantly positive correlation with soil pH. Our analyses suggest that erosion/re-deposition of topsoil is partly responsible for the negative SIC-SOC relationship in LFB, and high soil pH and stronger hydrological processes are attributable to relatively lower levels of SOC in YCB. This study highlights that soil carbon fractions in the lowland of Loess Plateau are influenced by many drivers, which leads to complex relationships between major soil carbon pools.

Adoption of drought tolerant crop with suitable irrigation strategy is critical to improve water use efficiency and sustain crop production in the region. The objective of the study was to assess soil water extraction pattern and water use efficiency of spring canola (Brassica napus L.) under deficit irrigation strategy (DI). Three diverse canola cultivars ('H930', 'H955' and 'L140') were grown under four different irrigation treatments; full-season irrigation (FI), no irrigation at the vegetative stage (VS), no irrigation at the reproductive stage (RS) and dryland (DL). Treatment VS extracted similar amount (20 mm) of total water from planting to harvest as FI in wetter year of 2015. However, VS extracted 10 mm of extra water from soil depth down to 1.6 m until harvest compared to FI in drier year of 2016. As water extraction during reproductive stage in 2016 was almost similar (70 and 67 mm in FI and VS, respectively) in VS and FI, most of the extra water extracted was utilized during vegetative stage when irrigation was skipped in VS. Canola sustained vegetative growth utilizing soil water extraction and efficiently utilized irrigation received during reproductive stage to reduce seasonal evapotranspiration (ET) in VS compared to FI. Treatment RS and DL also reduced seasonal ET, but they reduced average 11 and 13 % oil content compared to FI in 2015 and 2016, respectively. The VS had similar oil content as FI and optimized water use efficiency for biomass (WUEpb), and seed (WUEsy) and oil (WUEoy) yields. Among cultivars, L140 consistently had the greatest WUEpb in both experimental years and 34 and 36 % greater WUEsy and WUEoy in 2016 compared to both H930 and H955, respectively. Adopting spring canola cultivar L140 and skipping irrigation during vegetative stage could maximize water productivity in water deficit conditions of the SGP.

FRONTIERS IN NUTRITION												Vitamin B9, particularly folic acid, is an essential molecule for human health. Wheat flour is one of the major sources of calorie intake by humans. The selection of folate-rich genotypes in wheat breeding can enhance the natural folate value in the daily diet. This study used a precise, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay to analyze folate content in a 262-accession Chinese wheat mini-core collection (MCC) grown under three environments. Four folate derivatives in grains including tetrahydrofolate (THF), 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-CH3-THF), 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-CHO-THF), and 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH+THF) were considered. An association analysis of water regimes, accession types, released years, geographical origin, and agronomic traits with folate content was conducted for the first time. There was a large amount of variation in folate content in the analyzed accessions, with genotype identified as the main influencing factor. Total folate content was significantly correlated with the content of the four MCC derivatives under the three environments. 5-CH3-THF and 5-CHO-THF were the most abundant among the four folate derivatives and were positively correlated with high folate content. The 12 accessions with the highest folate content showed an average of more than 80 mu g/100 g. The analysis demonstrated that this Chinese wheat had not undergone extensive selection for folate content during breeding, which is unrelated to the geographical origin, accession types, winter/spring types, and grain colors of wheat. The content of THF, 5-CH3-THF, and 5,10-CH+THF was significantly negatively correlated with grain width, grain thickness, and thousand kernel weight. A relatively weak negative relationship manifested between folate contents and flowering date, whereas no significant correlation with tiller number, grain number per spike, maturity date, height, and spike length was detected. The investigation benefits wheat breeders for folate enhancement.																			2296-861X					OCT 21	2022	9								933358	10.3389/fnut.2022.933358	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2022.933358								36337661					WOS:000884390700001

The aim of this study was to identify and map rust resistance loci at the seedling and the adult plant stages in 336 barley genotypes assembled at ICARDA as AM-2014. The seedling resistance to PSH was evaluated in the greenhouse individually for six virulent races originated from India. The adult stage resistance to PSH was evaluated in field located at Durgapura, Rajasthan, India. The AM-2014 panel was genotyped with infinium iSelect 9K barley SNP markers and genome-wide association studies were carried out using mixed linear model accounting for population structure (PCA) and kinship (K) as covariates. Eleven barley genotypes were identified resistant to all six PSH races at the seedling stage while these genotypes were also resistant at adult plant stage in the field. The most effective SNP markers (at least one for each QTL) associated with rust resistance was also identified using stepwise regression. A total of 17 and 25 resistance QTL to six races of PSH were identified in two- and six-rowed barley at the seedling stage, respectively. While, six and seven resistance QTL to PSH were detected at the adult stage in two- and six-rowed barley, respectively. The novel PSH resistant QTL detected at the seedling and adult stages are important for barley breeding programs globally.					mamidi, sujan/P-7009-2018; Gangwar, Om Prakash/ABA-5954-2021	mamidi, sujan/0000-0002-3837-6121; 													0014-2336	1573-5060				JAN 2	2021	217	1							3	10.1007/s10681-020-02728-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-020-02728-1													WOS:000606454000001

This programme has substantially increased vegetation cover and served to control soil erosion, but threatened regional food supply due to widespread cropland conversion. Consequently, a strategy balancing green and grain land uses is required. Here, we establish a dominance index of ecosystem services by quantifying the economic value of four key ecosystem services (net primary productivity, soil conservation, water yield, and food production), by combining spatially explicit datasets and census data. Using the dominance index, we identify the optimal areas to target for GFGP in the Loess Plateau. The identified areas (target areas) were the transition zone from low to high value of ecosystem services (ESV). These areas exhibited low grain productivity in addition to having the highest potential for soil conservation. Compared with other regions of the Loess Plateau, the loss of grain production due to cropland conversion in these target areas could decrease by 42%, whereas ESV could increase by 33%. Therefore, despite the fact that over the past 15 years (2000-2014) in these target areas more cropland was converted into ecological use (i.e. forest/grassland), there is still a need to strengthen ecological restoration in this region in the future. This study proposed a strategy for balancing green and grain from a spatial perspective, which could potentially solve land degradation issues and the tradeoff between ecosystem services in a more beneficial and targeted way.

Five treatments, including three homogeneous soil samples consisting of sandy soil, Montmorillonite-enriched sandstone, and sand-Montmorillonite-enriched sandstone mixture, together with two heterogeneous soil samples composed of sandy soil + Montmorillonite-enriched sandstone + sandy soil and sandy soil + sandy - Montmorillonite-enriched sandstone mixture (7:3) + sandy soil. Three replicates of each treatment were prepared in the indoor pillars to measure the infiltration process by auto-recording geometry, to investigate the infiltration features of various soil configurations by testing their infiltration rate, cumulative infiltration capacity, wetting front migration, and profile soil content, and to evaluate the infiltration of newly constructed soil in the natural conditions of the research area. The experiment demonstrated that the addition of Montmorillonite-enriched sandstone into sandy soil significantly slowed down soil water infiltration, especially in the heterogeneous soils. Traditional models perfectly simulated the soil water infiltration in the three homogeneous soils in which soil infiltration capacity could be segmentally fitted by Kostiakov model and linear model, and wetting front could be fitted by a power function. Compared with the homogeneous soil samples, heterogeneous soil could reduce the direct surface runoff and deep percolation, and is an idealized structure for soil reconstruction in opencast coal mine dump.																				2071-1050				DEC	2022	14	23							15929	10.3390/su142315929	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142315929													WOS:000896524500001

Fine-Mapping of Sorghum Stay-Green QTL on Chromosome10 Revealed Genes Associated with Delayed Senescence	GENES												This study was conducted to dissect the genetic basis and to explore the candidate genes underlying one of the important genomic regions on an SBI-10 long arm (L), governing the complex stay-green trait contributing to post-flowering drought-tolerance in sorghum. A fine-mapping population was developed from an introgression line cross-RSG04008-6 (stay-green) x J2614-11 (moderately senescent). The fine-mapping population with 1894 F-2 was genotyped with eight SSRs and a set of 152 recombinants was identified, advanced to the F-4 generation, field evaluated with three replications over 2 seasons, and genotyped with the GBS approach. A high-resolution linkage map was developed for SBI-10L using 260 genotyping by sequencing-Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (GBS-SNPs). Using the best linear unpredicted means (BLUPs) of the percent green leaf area (%GL) traits and the GBS-based SNPs, we identified seven quantitative trait loci (QTL) clusters and single gene, mostly involved in drought-tolerance, for each QTL cluster, viz., AP2/ERF transcription factor family (Sobic.010G202700), NBS-LRR protein (Sobic.010G205600), ankyrin-repeat protein (Sobic.010G205800), senescence-associated protein (Sobic.010G270300), WD40 (Sobic.010G205900), CPK1 adapter protein (Sobic.010G264400), LEA2 protein (Sobic.010G259200) and an expressed protein (Sobic.010G201100). The target genomic region was thus delimited from 15 Mb to 8 genes co-localized with QTL clusters, and validated using quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR.					kiranmayee, usha/R-8762-2017	Kiranmayee, K N S Usha/0000-0002-7413-965X; Gupta, Rajeev/0000-0002-1451-215X; Punna, Ramu/0000-0003-3998-568X; Amindala, BhanuPrakash/0000-0001-8825-1370; Deshpande, Santosh/0000-0002-7182-3456; Rathore, Abhishek/0000-0001-6887-4095														2073-4425				SEP	2020	11	9							1026	10.3390/genes11091026	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes11091026								32883037					WOS:000581344000001
J	Li, XZ; Shao, MA; Xu, XL				Li, Xuezhang; Shao, Ming'an; Xu, Xianli			Prediction of soil water storage using temporal stability in different landscape positions on the northern loess plateau, China	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Soil water storage (SWS) dynamics are affected by many factors in semiarid regions such as the Loess Plateau. Spatiotemporal variation of SWS varies greatly with different landscape positions due to the rolling and fragmented terrain landscape of the Loess Plateau. However, information on the SWS and its temporal stability at different landscape positions is lacking. In this study, hillslope, dam land and gully landscape positions were selected in a typical small watershed in the Loess Plateau. A soil water observation belt with 28 sample locations was set up at each landscape position, and temporal stability analysis was conducted using SWS data of 12 sampling events. The results showed that the variation characteristics of profile SWS are influenced by landscape position. The persistence of spatial SWS patterns in different landscape positions increases with the increase of soil depth. On each landscape position, representative locations can accurately predict their SWS based on temporal stability analysis. Moreover, the stability of SWS at the representative locations was more important than its content during the prediction process. The dominant factors that lead to the difference of temporal stability characteristics in different landscape positions varied with the change in soil depths. The results provide an important basis for vegetation reconstruction and water management in small Loess Plateau watersheds.

The method does not involve the introduction of any enzyme or external oxidants. More importantly, large equipment is not needed and only a 20 & mu;L sample is needed for each analysis which only takes 8 min. The filter paper is pre-treated with TMB and it turns blue upon UV irradiation because TMB is a self-photosensitizer. The phenol hydroxyl groups of AA can inhibit photo-triggered oxidation resulting in a lighter blue color. The color signal is captured using a smartphone and analyzed using color analysis software. A series of factors that affect the performance of the device are investigated, including the concentration of TMB, buffer pH, channel selection, and irradiation time. The analytical performance is evaluated, and the results show that the method has a wide detection range of 0.05-1.0 mmol L-1 as well as a high selectivity and reproducibility. The proposed method is applied for assaying AA in beverage samples and a VC tablet, and the results correspond to those obtained using the UV method. The results of the recovery test of human serum indicate that the proposed method is feasible in biological samples. This device is easy to fabricate, and convenient to store and transport. It is a truly portable device which has great potential in the on-site assay.					ma, rui/JGE-4890-2023; Zhang, Lili/HGE-8014-2022	Zhang, Lili/0000-0002-7873-3867; Liu, Xiaoxia/0000-0002-3673-4271													1144-0546	1369-9261				SEP 11	2023	47	35					16735	16740		10.1039/d3nj02986g	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d3nj02986g		AUG 2023											WOS:001051939000001

Bridging the gap: decomposing sources of gender yield gaps in Uganda groundnut production	GENDER TECHNOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT												Female plot managers in Sub-Saharan Africa often realize significantly lower crop yields than their male counterparts. Even for legumes, which are often referred to as 'women's crops', yields are significantly lower. This study investigated the underlying causes of this gender yield gap in groundnut production. The analysis is based on survey data from 228 farm households from two groundnut growing regions in Uganda. We used the Blinder-Oaxaca model to decompose factors that contribute to this yield gap. Results show 63% and 44% gender yield gaps for improved and local varieties, respectively, with female plot managers realizing less than their male counterparts. Improved groundnut seeds increase female plot manager's yields but not the yields of male plot managers. Male advantage and female disadvantage combined account for more than 70% of the yield gap in both improved and local groundnut variety production and exceed pure productivity differences. Labor use differences between female and male plot managers and variety types explain the observed yield gap. Interventions and policies that increase women's access to productive inputs including improved seed will significantly contribute to closing the yield gap, and thereby increase crop production, food security, as well as women's incomes.

Method: Preliminary trials were performed using different levels of rose sirup (8-14%) and marigold powder (0.40-0.55%) in the pre-standardized FB. The most acceptable concentration was selected on the basis of sensory analysis. Selected beverages were then subjected to the physicochemical analysis, assessment of bioactive compounds and FTIR characterization. The effect of flower extracts on the mineral content and storage life (4 +/- 1 degrees C) of beverages was also studied. The significant difference in treatments was determined using Duncan's multiple range test, SPSS 25.0. Results: The best acceptable concentrations for rose sirup and marigold powder were 10% and 0.50%, respectively. A significant (p <= 0.05) decrease in the dietary fiber (6.50%) and beta-glucan (3.95%) content was observed on the addition of rose sirup. Significant (p <= 0.05) increase in the total phenols (119.18-145.23%), beta-carotene (0.37%), anthocyanins (78.82-230.58%) and antioxidant activity (4.98-7.17%) was observed on the addition of flower extracts. Strong peaks were observed in the regions of 3600-3200, 3000-2800 and 1700-1600 cm (- 1) on FTIR characterization. A significant decrease in the mineral content of FB was also found on the addition of rose sirup. Rose flavored beverage had the highest overall acceptability (7.83 +/- 0.23) and storage stability (50 days at refrigerated storage) among the prepared beverages. Conclusion: The addition of flower extracts significantly improved the acceptability of the prepared beverages. It not only improved the phytochemical profile but also had a substantial impact on storage stability.

Identification of heterotic groups in South-Asian-bred hybrid parents of pearl millet	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS												Key message Pearl millet breeding programs can use this heterotic group information on seed and restorer parents to generate new series of pearl millet hybrids having higher yields than the existing hybrids. Five hundred and eighty hybrid parents, 320 R- and 260 B-lines, derived from 6 pearl millet breeding programs in India, genotyped following RAD-GBS (about 0.9 million SNPs) clustered into 12 R- and 7 B-line groups. With few exceptions, hybrid parents of all the breeding programs were found distributed across all the marker-based groups suggesting good diversity in these programs. Three hundred and twenty hybrids generated using 37 (22 R and 15 B) representative parents, evaluated for grain yield at four locations in India, showed significant differences in yield, heterosis, and combining ability. Across all the hybrids, mean mid- and better-parent heterosis for grain yield was 84.0% and 60.5%, respectively. Groups G12 B x G12 R and G10 B x G12 R had highest heterosis of about 10% over best check hybrid Pioneer 86M86. The parents involved in heterotic hybrids were mainly from the groups G4R, G10B, G12B, G12R, and G13B. Based on the heterotic performance and combining ability of groups, 2 B-line (HGB-1 and HGB-2) and 2 R-line (HGR-1 and HGR-2) heterotic groups were identified. Hybrids from HGB-1 x HGR-1 and HGB-2 x HGR-1 showed grain yield heterosis of 10.6 and 9.3%, respectively, over best hybrid check. Results indicated that parental groups can be formed first by molecular markers, which may not predict the best hybrid combination, but it can reveal a practical value of assigning existing and new hybrid pearl millet parental lines into heterotic groups to develop high-yielding hybrids from the different heterotic groups.

Assessing lethal doses of the baculovirus <i>MaviMNPV</i> and the effect of its combination with neem oil on the survival of <i>Maruca vitrata</i> (Fabricius) <i>(</i>Lepidoptera: Crambidae) larval stages in laboratory	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE												Cowpea production is limited by predation from several insect pests, including Maruca vitrata (F.) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) as one of the most destructive. The present study aimed to assess the pesticidal effect of neem oil and the baculovirus MaviMNPV (separately and in combination) on M. vitrata under laboratory conditions. Eight treatments in a 4-replicate randomized block design (including control) were assessed at each of the five M. vitrata larval stages. Neem oil induced larval mortality ranging from 41.50 +/- 2.50% to 97.08 +/- 2.00%, with the lower values in L4 and L5, while MaviMNPV induced larval mortality varying from 15 +/- 0.63% to 100 +/- 00% (depending on larval stages). Used in combination, induced larval mortality was higher still (from 28.33 +/- 4.40% to 100 +/- 00%), suggesting a synergistic or additive action. Cox regression also indicated that MaviMNPV larval mortality was dose-dependent when applied at large stages L1, L2, and L3.																			1742-7584	1742-7592				JUN	2022	42	3					2143	2149		10.1007/s42690-022-00734-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42690-022-00734-5		MAR 2022											WOS:000770526700001

However, the effect of long-term sand fixation on the composition, diversity, and underlying functions of microbes in the C. korshinskii rhizosphere in dryland ecosystems remain unclear. Here, we performed high-throughput sequencing using a 16S rRNA (absolute quantification) and bacterial functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa (FAPROTAX) analysis and an ITS (relative quantification) and fungal functional guild (FUNGuild) analysis to investigate the C. korshinskii rhizosphere microbiome and metabolic functional groups at different sand-fixing ages (six years, CK6; twelve years, CK12; and eighteen years, CK18) and determined the physicochemical properties of the rhizosphere soil. Results showed that the key bacterial taxa of the rhizosphere were significantly more abundant in CK18 than in CK12 and CK6 at the phylum-class-genus level, and that fungal Glomeromycota was also significantly more abundant in the CK18 rhizosphere compared to CK12 and CK6. Among these bacterial taxa, the enrichment effect of key, functional, genus-level species of bacteria was the most obvious, including Rhizobium, Ensifer, Neorhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Streptomyces, Sphingomonas, and Flavobacterium, which are N-fixing and/or phosphate-solubilizing groups. The significant improvement seen in the physicochemical properties of the CK18 rhizosphere soil, including the higher total nitrogen (TN), available nitrogen (AN), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), higher N:P ratio, and lower C:N ratio, all demonstrated the relationship between the rhizosphere microbes and soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. A redundancy analysis (RDA) of different taxonomic levels indicated a close positive relationship between rhizosphere microbes and AN. In addition, the functional groups of the C. korshinskii rhizosphere bacteria were closely related to soil AN and were mainly composed of chemoheterotrophy and aerobic chemoheterotrophy. A Spearman correlation analysis revealed that these functional groups were mainly identified from bacterial Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Bacteroidetes, and fungal Glomeromycota. Our study provides evidence that the rhizosphere microbes of C. korshinskii are closely related to the accumulation of N in the restoration of desert ecosystems, and that the ecological functional processes they are involved in mainly involve C and N cycles, which play an important role in desertification reversal.

Soil organic carbon (SOC) stock and its fractions were quantified under 3 different grazing intensities using 5, 10 and 15 sheep/ ha under sown, improved and natural pastures in the semi-arid tropics of India. Results revealed that after 3 years, improved pasture had significantly higher particulate organic carbon (POC-4.5 g/kg), SOC (-0.53 %), total organic carbon (TOC-7 g/kg) and SOC stock (-15 mg/ha) as compared with sown and natural pastures. Labile carbon (LC -185 mg/kg) and soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC -378 mu g/g soil) were higher under natural pasture. A moderate grazing intensity of 10 sheep/ha resulted in significantly greater carbon fractions, TOC and SOC stock. SOC stock and its fractions were significantly higher in the topsoil layers as compared with the subsoil layers. These results indicate that improved pasture management practices with moderate grazing intensity can be recommended for improving SOC stock and its fractions in semi-arid tropical pastures.

Because natural desalinization by gravitational drainage is very difficult in paddy fields, drainage facilities are needed to remove salts from affected paddy fields. A rice husk underdrainage system (RHUS) is one applicable method. Although this system is simple and reasonable, there is an unfortunate lack of available information for its practical realization. In this study, we conducted numerical field-scale experiments with an RHUS using HYDRUS 2D/3D software to obtain information for designing such a system. Our results clarified the effect of outlet size, rice husk drain (RHD) width, and RHD gradient on the amount of discharged soil water/salts and saline water movement in the paddy field. We summarized our results as follows: (1) outlet size did not affect the system's drainage ability; (2) small-width RHD discharged saline soil water at a greater rate than large-width RHD when using the same amount of leaching water; (3) because the RHD worked as a bypass of saline water movement from the plow layer to the lower soil layer, the amount of saline water removed from the plow layer was larger with the large-width RHD than with the small-width RHD; and (4) the large gradient of the RHD was advantageous in increasing the amount of discharged saline soil water, but the effect was small, so it appears unnecessary for practical application.

Field data collection based on points does not produce spatially continuous information about surface indicators and cannot cover vast geographic areas. Remote sensing is possibly a labor- and time-saving method to estimate important biophysical indicators of vegetation and surface condition at both temporal and spatial scales impossible with field methods. Regression models based on machine learning algorithms, such as random forest (RF), can build relationships between field and remotely sensed data, while also providing error estimates. In this study, field data including over 15,000 points from the Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) and Landscape Monitoring Framework (LMF) programs on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands throughout the Western U.S., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) parameters, MODIS nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) surface reflectance products with ancillary data were used as predictor variables in a k-fold cross-validation approach to RF modeling. RF regression models were built to predict fourteen indicators of vegetation cover and height, as well as bare gap parameters. The RF model estimates exhibited good correlations with independent samples, with a low bias and a low RMSE. External cross-validation showed good agreement with out-of-bag (OOB) errors produced by RF and also allowed mapping prediction uncertainty. Predicted distribution maps of the surface indicators were produced by using these relationships across the arid and semiarid Western U.S. The bias and RMSE distribution maps show that the sample insufficiency and unevenly pattern of sample strongly impact the accuracy of the RF regression and prediction. The results from this study clearly show the utility of RF as a means to estimate multiple dryland surface indicators from remotely sensed data, and the reliability of the OOB errors in assessing the accuracy of the predictions.

Influence of nitrogen supply on gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence and grain yield of breeding lines of common bean evaluated in the Amazon region of Colombia	ACTA PHYSIOLOGIAE PLANTARUM												The common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is a food crop that provides fiber, vitamins and carbohydrates and it is produced by smallholders in developing countries under nitrogen (N)-depleted and low-fertility soil conditions. Soil acidity and the associated aluminum toxic and phosphorus deficient conditions are known to reduce symbiotic N-fixing ability of common bean. Breeding lines of common bean have been developed to adapt to acid-soil and high-temperature conditions in the Amazon region but the response of these lines to N application was not determined. The present study was conducted with an objective to identify genotypic differences among ten common bean breeding lines (4 Andean, 5 Mesoamerican, 1 interspecific) in their physiological characteristics (gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthetic efficiency) and their contribution to superior agronomic performance under three different levels of N (0, 60 and 120 kg N ha(-1); N0, N60 and N120) supply. We tested the hypothesis that common bean genotypes that combine greater capacity to assimilate carbon with improved ability to mobilize photosynthates to developing pods and seeds could enhance their agronomic performance at different levels of N supply under high-temperature and acid soil-stress conditions in the field. A randomized complete block design with factorial arrangement (3 levels of Nx10 genotypes) in three replications was used for the study. Measurements included photosynthetic gas exchange characteristics (light and CO2-saturated photosynthesis), chlorophyll fluorescence, viability of pollen, leaf N concentration, photosynthetic N use efficiency and grain yield. The increase in supply of N had a significant effect on grain yield and on different photosynthetic characteristics. Results showed that lines with indeterminate growth habit responded better to increase in N supply through their physiological response in improving grain yield. Among the genotypes evaluated, two lines (BFS 10 and SEF 10) were outstanding in their agronomic performance due to greater photosynthetic capacity combined with greater ability to mobilize photosynthates to grain with increase in N supply. These two lines can serve as parents for further improvement in resource use efficiency and multiple-stress resistance of common bean in the tropics.

The performance of ensemble algorithms with multi-source/multi-scale (30 m, 90 m, 250 m, 500 m, and 1000 m) remote sensing data to predict the groundwater levels of the MODS of the Tarim Basin should be investigated. To improve the current knowledge on the spatial distribution of groundwater in this region, we conducted a study on the applicability of ensemble learning algorithms for groundwater assessments in typical regions of dryland, namely the Oasis-Taklimakan Desert (OTD), Nature land in Oasis system (NLOS), Irrigation area (IA), and Oasis system (OS). The results showed that the R-2 values of the groundwater level prediction accuracy for the four ecosystems were 0.92, 0.96, 0.86, and 0.50, respectively, and their corresponding optimal ensemble algorithms were AR_GRBFN, AR_RF, RotationForest_MLP, and AR_ GRBFN. The scales corresponding to the optimal prediction accuracy of OTD, NLOS, IA, and OS were 250 m, 30 m, 250 m, and 90 m, respectively, and the effect of the scale on their respective groundwater level prediction accuracies (maximum value compared to minimum value) were 11.48%, 21.63%, 26.73%, and 10.59%. Random Subspace, Rotation Forest, and Additive Regression improved the pre-diction accuracy of the base learning method by 76%, 72%, and 64%, respectively, followed by Bagging, whereas Dagging greatly increased prediction errors. Rotation Forest and Random Subspace showed stable performances and guaranteed relatively low prediction errors. Among all ensemble algorithms, Additive Regression helped the base learners obtain relatively optimal prediction accuracies with high probabilities. Except for the OS system, groundwater level could be predicted with much greater accuracy at depths of >8 m than at <8 m. The contribution analysis showed that topography and land-use patterns controlled the spatial distribution of groundwater across MODS. The ensemble learning algorithm showed good performance using multi-source and multi-scale data.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				MAY	2023	620		A						129399	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129399	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129399		MAR 2023											WOS:001065814900001

However, species differences in transpiration magnitude, seasonality, and biophysical regulation in dryland urban regions are not well understood. We measured the sap flow of three widely planted coniferous species, Pinus tabulaeformis, Pinus sylvestris, and Picea meyeri, for urban greening, and concurrent soil moisture and meteorological variables in three pure urban forest plantations during three successive growing seasons (May to September during 2017-2019) under a semiarid urban environment in northern China. Standlevel transpiration (Ec) differed significantly among the three species (p < 0.001), where the mean daily Ec of P. tabulaeformis, P. sylvestris, and P. meyeri plantations were 0.78 +/- 0.02 mm d-1, 0.68 +/- 0.01 mm d-1, and 0.20 +/- 0.01 mm d-1, respectively. Additionally, distinct differences in the seasonality of Ec were observed among tree species. Except for 2017, the Ec of P. tabulaeformis and P. sylvestris maintained at low levels in May and June and increased significantly with precipitation in July and August (p < 0.05) when soil volumetric water content (VWC) increased, but the Ec of P. meyeri remained relatively stable throughout the growing season. Responses of Ec in P. tabulaeformis and P. sylvestris plantations to meteorological factors can be changed by soil water availability. Under relatively higher water availability, the Ec of P. tabulaeformis and P. sylvestris were primarily controlled by vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and solar radiation (Rs). Under soil water stress, the Ec of P. tabulaeformis and P. sylvestris were more affected by VWC than P. meyeri. Biologically, P. tabulaeformis had a higher stomatal sensitivity to VPD than P. sylvestris and P. meyeri. At the beginning of growing seasons, the high water use in P. tabulaeformis and P. sylvestris plantations could lead to soil water depletion. Therefore, the speciesspecific biophysical regulations of tree water use should be carefully considered for urban forest management to achieve ecosystem services by balancing the tradeoff between water consumption and its cooling effects (through evapotranspiration) in semiarid cities.

Thus, assessing the changes in soils properties in reforested lands is critical for sustainable restoration of vegetation. We conducted a continuous rainfall manipulation experiment from June 2015 to November 2016 using mature black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) on southern Loess Plateau of China. The soil hydrological properties, aggregate distribution and aggregate organic carbon (CC) and total nitrogen (N) concentrations were measured. Two years of drought stress caused a significant decline in saturated hydraulic conductivity and total porosity, but an increase bulk density in the 0-10 cm soil layer. The short drought stress significantly decreased soil aggregate stability due to a decline in macro-aggregate mass. Drought stress significantly decreased total soil OC concentration and macro- and micro-OC or N concentrations, but had no significant effect on total N concentration after two years of drought. Furthermore, the influence of short drought on soil hydrological properties, aggregate distribution and aggregate OC and total N concentrations was mainly evident at the depth of 10 cm. Our results indicated that short drought has the potential to damage soil properties. The results of this study could provide more insight into the sustainability of afforestation in semi-humid areas of China's Loess Plateau.																			0016-7061	1872-6259				MAR 15	2019	338						170	177		10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.11.051	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.11.051													WOS:000457657000018

In this work, we assess the spatial and temporal variability of Cottonwood (Populus fremontii)-Willow (Salix gooddingii) riparian gallery woodland ET and its relationships to vegetation structure and climate variables for 80 km of the San Pedro River corridor in southeastern Arizona, USA, between 2014 and 2019. We use a novel combination of publicly available remote sensing, climate and hydrological datasets: cloud-based Landsat thermal remote sensing data products for ET (Google Earth Engine EEFlux), Landsat multispectral imagery and field data-based calibrations to vegetation structure (leaf-area index, LAI), and open-source climate and hydrological data. We show that at landscape scales, daily ET rates (6-10 mm day(-1)) and growing season ET totals (400-1,400 mm) matched rates of published field data, and modelled reach-scale average LAI (0.80-1.70) matched lower ranges of published field data. Over 6 years, the spatial variability of total growing season ET (CV = 0.18) exceeded that of temporal variability (CV = 0.10), indicating the importance of reach-scale vegetation and hydrological conditions for controlling ET dynamics. Responses of ET to climate differed between perennial and intermittent-flow stream reaches. At perennial-flow reaches, ET correlated significantly with temperature, whilst at intermittent-flow sites ET correlated significantly with rainfall and stream discharge. Amongst reaches studied in detail, we found positive but differing logarithmic relationships between LAI and ET. By documenting patterns of high spatial variability of ET at basin scales, these results underscore the importance of accurately accounting for differences in woodland vegetation structure and hydrological conditions for assessing water-use requirements. Results also suggest that the climate sensitivity of ET may be used as a remote indicator of subsurface water resources relative to vegetation demand, and an indicator for informing conservation management priorities.

Nevertheless, the relationship between carbon sources and carbon sinks in sandy soils is a hotly debated subject. In particular, how plants and environmental conditions interact to affect SOC remains unclear in sandy deserts. Here, we investigated 77 sites at depths of 0-100 cm (soil depth was divided by 0-5 cm, 5-10 cm, 10-20 cm,20-30 cm, 30-50 cm, 50-70 cm and 70-100 cm intervals), collected 1617 soil samples, and obtained the climatic conditions, vegetation types, and edaphic factors associated with the sampling sites. This study aims to determine whether there are divisions in the allocation strategies of SOC by various vegetation types, and to analyze the mechanisms of environmental factors on the soil carbon pool in sandy deserts. Our results found that (1) the mean value of SOC in the sandy desert was 2.19 g.kg(-1), which differed significantly among different vegetation types (P < 0.05), yet there were no significant changes in aboveground biomass and litter biomass. (2) SOC did not significantly differ among soil layers except for the Ceratoides latent (P = 0.04), and Seriphidium terrae-albae (P = 0.02) communities. (3) The mean value of soil organic carbon density (SOCD) was 3.38 kg.m(-2) and increased exponentially with soil depth (R-2 = 0.23, P < 0.05). (4) Mean annual precipitation controlled the spatial distribution of SOC variation in sandy desert. Vegetation types, soil variables, topographic factors did not control SOC, but had a strong interactive effect with climatic factors. The explanatory power of interaction effects often showed an improvement over single variables, manifested as nonlinear enhancement and bivariate enhancement. Our results highlighted the nature of the desert's position in the global carbon cycle and provide key information on missing carbon sinks in the driest zone.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				SEP	2022	142								109224	10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109224	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109224		JUL 2022											WOS:000861057700002

There is also growing interest in assessing whether a whole-plant coordination exists between traits related to water-use and the leaf economic spectrum (LES). We used water stable isotopes (delta H-2, delta O-18) to quantify water uptake proportions from different soil depths by 24 species in a Mediterranean shrubland. Leaf traits associated with water-use efficiency, stomatal regulation (delta C-13, delta O-18) and the LES (SLA, N, P, K concentrations) were also measured. We assessed potential trade-offs between the above-mentioned leaf traits, water uptake depth and their relationship with species abundance. We found distinct ecohydrological niche segregation among coexisting species. Bayesian models showed that our shrubland species used a median of 37% of shallow soil water (0-30 cm) and 63% of deep water (30-100 cm). Still, water source proportions varied considerably among species, as shallow soil water-use ranged from a minimum of 6.4% to a maximum of 68%. Interspecific variability in foliar carbon investment (SLA) and nutrient concentrations was remarkably high, indicating diverse nutrient-use strategies along the LES. Leaf delta O-18, delta C-13 and delta N-15 values also differed widely among species, revealing differences in stomatal regulation, water-use efficiency and nitrogen acquisition mechanisms. After accounting for evolutionary history effects, water uptake depth was coordinated with the LES: species using shallower soil water from fertile topsoil layers exhibited a more acquisitive carbon- and nutrient-use strategy, whereas water uptake from deeper but less fertile soil layers was linked to a more conservative nutrient-use strategy. Leaf-level water-use traits significantly influenced species abundance, as water-savers with tight stomatal regulation and high water-use efficiency were dominant. Synthesis. Greater utilisation of water stored in nutrient-rich topsoil layers favoured a more acquisitive nutrient-use strategy, whereas a deeper water uptake pattern appeared to constrain access to nutrients. Our findings thus suggest a largely inescapable trade-off and coordination between soil water uptake depth and carbon- and nutrient-use strategies in low-fertility drylands.

J	Allegrini, M; Gomez, E; Zabaloy, MC				Allegrini, Marco; Gomez, Elena; Zabaloy, Maria Celina			Acute glyphosate exposure does not condition the response of microbial communities to a dry-rewetting disturbance in a soil with a long history of glyphosate-based herbicides	SOIL												Dry-rewetting perturbations are natural disturbances in the edaphic environment and particularly in dryland cultivation areas. The interaction of this disturbance with glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) deserves special attention in the soil environment due to the intensification of agricultural practices and the acceleration of climate change with an intensified water cycle. The objective of this study was to assess the response of microbial communities in a soil with a long history of GBHs to a secondary imposed perturbation (a single dry-rewetting event). A factorial microcosm study was conducted to evaluate the potential conditioning effect of an acute glyphosate exposure on the response to a following dry-rewetting event. A respiratory quotient (RQ) based on an ecologically relevant substrate (p-coumaric acid) and basal respiration was used as a physiological indicator. Similarly, DNA-based analyses were considered, including quantitative PCR (qPCR) of functional sensitive microbial groups linked to cycles of carbon (Actinobacteria) and nitrogen (ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms), qPCR of total bacteria and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Significant effects of herbicide and of dry-rewetting perturbations were observed in the RQ and in the copy number of the amoA gene of AOB, respectively. However, no significant interaction was observed between them when analyzing the physiological indicator and the copy number of the evaluated genes. PCR- DGGE results were not conclusive regarding a potential effect of dry-rewetting x herbicide interaction on AOB community structure, suggesting further analysis by deep sequencing of the amoA gene. The results of this study indicate that the perturbation of an acute glyphosate exposure in a soil with a long history of this herbicide does not have a conditioning effect on the response to a subsequent dry-rewetting disturbance according to a physiological indicator or the quantified bacterial/archaeal genes. This is particularly relevant for the sustainability of soils in rainfed agriculture, where frequent exposure to GBHs along with intensification of hydrological cycles are expected to occur. Further studies considering multiple dry-rewetting disturbances and in different soil types should be conducted to simulate those conditions and to validate our results.

Finding Ngabi<i> </i>(<i>Hemiaspis</i><i> damelii</i>)<i>:</i> factors affecting the use of modified floodplain wetlands by an endangered snake	WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Context. River regulation, coupled with climate change, has caused significant declines in global freshwater biodiversity. In Australia, water extraction within the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) has reduced the frequency, extent and duration with which floodplains are inundated, resulting in widespread declines in wetland-dependent biodiversity, including reptiles. The endangered Ngabi (Hemiaspis damelii) is associated with floodplain systems in the MDB, yet its distribution and ecological requirements are poorly understood, hampering conservation actions. Aims. We sought to validate an assumption that Ngabi is associated with wetland vegetation communities before investigating factors affecting its probability of detection in the lower Murrumbidgee catchment in southern New South Wales. We predicted Ngabi occurrence patterns would relate to frog abundance, wetland hydrology, microhabitat attributes and meteorological variables. Methods. We compared Ngabi observations from 16 paired wetland and dryland vegetation transects to evaluate associations with vegetation type. We then used generalised linear mixed models to relate snake presence and absence to prey (frog abundance), microhabitat (logs and ground cover), wetland hydrology (water depth and inundation frequency) and meteorological conditions, using 12 repeat surveys between September 2018 and March 2021. Key results. Fiftyeight snakes were observed at five of eight wetlands during the study. Ngabi was exclusively recorded in river red gum/spike rush or lignum vegetation communities, and was absent from sandhill woodland or chenopod communities. The probability of detecting Ngabi increased with ambient temperature and weakly with wetland inundation frequency, but not frog abundance, microhabitat attributes or year. Conclusions. Ngabi is strongly associated with floodplain vegetation communities and, to some extent, frequently inundated wetlands in southern NSW, suggesting water management agencies should incorporate threatened floodplain snake species into future wetland management plans. The use of environmental water to restore aspects of flow regimes, improve wetland health and aquatic diversity is likely to benefit other wetland dependent snake populations across the MDB. Implications. The positive relationship between Ngabi detections and ambient temperature will be important for designing an effective monitoring program for the species across the MDB. Furthermore, our findings provide insight into the benefits of using environmental water to create wetland refuges to maintain floodplain snake populations during droughts.

However, the direct and indirect effect of different resource-derived organic fertilizers on soil bacterial communities and their links to soil aggregate is poorly understood. Here, we carried out a field experiment for three years to investigate the linkages between soil aggregates and bacterial diversity in a dryland red soil. Six treatments were compared: (no fertilizer (CK), chemical fertilizer (CF), 60% chemical fertilizer + straw at 4500 kg ha-1 (RFS), 60% CF + biochar at 1500 kg ha-1 (RFB), 60% CF + pig manure at 15000 kg ha-1 (RFP), and 60% CF + vermicompost at 15000 kg ha-1 (RFV)). The application of pig manure or vermicompost (animal-derived organic fertilizer) enhanced the soil pH, the content of large macroaggregate ( 2 mm), organic matter, available phosphorous and available nitrogen, while decreased the content of small macroaggregate (0.25-2 mm) and microaggregate (<0.25 mm) compared with other treatment. Relative abundances of the dominant bacterial phyla varied across chemical and organic fertilizer treatments, primarily by increasing Bacteroidetes, Gemmatimonadetes, and decreasing Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria and Planctomycetes. Organic fertilizers particularly animal-derived organic fertilizer enhanced the Richness, Shannon and Pielou indices of soil bacteria compared with chemical fertilizer treatment. The regulation of animal-derived organic fertilizers on bacterial community structure (accounting for 53.04% of the variance) was greater than that of plant-derived organic fertilizers (straw and biochar, accounting for 7.69% of the variance). The bacterial alpha diversity showed positive correlation with large macroaggregate, but a negative correlation with small macroaggregate. Further, structural equation models indicated that animal-derived organic fertilizers impacted bacterial diversity positively by regulating resource availability through soil aggregates. However, for the plant-derived organic fertilizers, bacterial diversity was negatively affected by soil aggregates alone, but this was not regulated by fertilization. In addition, animal-derived organic fertilizer also positively affected soil bacteria diversity indirectly via changing soil pH and resource availability. Overall, the different impacts of animal- and plant-derived organic fertilizers on soil bacterial community highlighting the pivotal role of soil habitat architecture and resource chemistry changed by organic fertilizers in the regulation of soil bacteria, which may influence soil quality and agricultural sustainable development.					zhang, meng/JMB-0951-2023; Hu, Feng/IAN-4009-2023; zhang, min/IYI-9869-2023														0929-1393	1873-0272				SEP	2021	165								104020	10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.104020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.104020		APR 2021											WOS:000657601200011

Conservation tillage led to reduced water and soil losses and increased grain yield, and is therefore one potential solution, but this approach requires an understanding of the complex adaptive traits for environment conditions. In this study, a 4-year field experiment was conducted to quantify the crop yield, runoff and soil water, organic C and N content dynamics in summer maize-winter wheat rations subjected to different tillage and straw management practices. Based on these, the effects of different tillage and straw management regimes on water, C and N balances of the soil-plant system was evaluated with a 11-year model prediction using the SPACSYS model. The treatments used in this study included conventional tillage (CT) with straw removal, conventional tillage with straw returning (CTSR), reduced tillage (RT) with straw removal and reduced tillage with straw returning (RTSR). The results showed that maize yield was remarkably affected by straw returning while there was no significant tillage effect. By contrast, wheat yield showed a high inter-annual variability, but was not significantly influenced by tillage and straw management practices. The soil water balance analysis demonstrated that the treatments with straw returning improved water use efficiency by increasing transpiration while reducing water losses through evaporation and runoff, compared to the straw-removal treatments. The simulations for all of the treatments showed that the soils acted as C and N sinks in the present study. Furthermore, plots that included straw returning amassed more C and N in the soil than the that with straw removal. Our work demonstrates that in maize-wheat rotation slopping land reduced tillage with straw returning is a win-win practice for the equilibrium between agricultural productivity and low soil water, C and N losses.

Therefore, a clear understanding of the biology of weeds under water stress could assist in the development of sustainable weed management strategies. Avena fatua (wild oat) and A. ludoviciana (sterile oat) are problematic weeds in Australian winter crops. The objectives of this study were to determine the growth and reproductive behaviour of A. fatua and A. ludoviciana at different soil moisture levels [20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% water holding capacity (WHC)]. Results revealed that A. fatua did not survive and failed to produce seeds at 20 and 40% WHC. However, A. ludoviciana survived at 40% WHC and produced 54 seeds plant(-1). A. fatua produced a higher number of seeds per plant than A. ludoviciana at 80 (474 vs 406 seeds plant(-1)) and 100% WHC (480 vs 417 seeds plant(-1)). Seed production for both species remained similar at 80 and 100% WHC; however, higher than 60% WHC. Seed production of A. fatua and A. ludoviciana was 235 and 282 seeds plant(-1), respectively, at 60% WHC. The 60% WHC reduced seed production of A. fatua and A. ludoviciana by 51 and 32% respectively, compared to 100% WHC. The plant height, leaf weight, stem weight, and root weight per plant of A. fatua at 60% WHC reduced by 45, 27, 32, and 59%, respectively, as compared with 100% WHC. Similarly, the plant height, leaf weight, stem weight, and root weight per plant of A. ludoviciana at 60% WHC reduced by 45, 35, 47 and 76%, respectively, as compared with 100% WHC. Results indicate that A. ludoviciana can survive and produce seeds at 40% of WHC, indicating the adaptation of the species to dryland conditions. The results also suggest that A. ludoviciana is likely to be robust under water stress conditions, potentially reducing crop yield. The ability of A. fatua and A. ludoviciana to produce seeds under water-stressed conditions (60% WHC) necessitates integrated weed management strategies that suppress these weeds whilst taking into account the efficient utilization of stored moisture for winter crops.

Wilczek) and Their Expression in Two Wild Non-progenitors Reveal Their Role in <i>MYMIV</i> Resistance	JOURNAL OF PLANT GROWTH REGULATION												Plants have an intrinsic defense mechanism to defend themselves from different pathogens and activate suitable genetic mechanisms inside the cells via proteins. These proteins are encoded by a class of defense-related genes known as "R-genes". Nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeats (NBS-LRRs) proteins recognize the pathogens directly or indirectly and activate downstream signaling pathways, which activate defense response. In the present study, the detailed analysis of NBS-LRR genes in mungbean (Vigna radiata) and their expression in two mungbean yellow mosaic India virus (MYMIV)-resistant wild Vigna accessions, PRR 2008-2 (V. umbellata) and TCR-20 (V. glabrescens), have been studied. Total of 87 VrNBS proteins were identified in mungbean genome and their subsequent classification and characterization were done. The expression of VrNBS-LRR genes in the wild non-progenitor Vigna species revealed that the MYMIV resistance in both the species follows different pathways. Therefore, the present study demonstrated the expression of VrNBS genes in wild Vigna background. The informations generated in present study will provide a valuable resource. The study also gives a clue for utilizing wild Vigna gene pool for improving MYMIV resistance in mungbean.

Temporal variations of soil structure and erosion characteristics during and after heavy rainstorms were less investigated, particularly across a wide soil texture gradient. In this study, 15 soilswere selected with clay content ranging in 12.9-38.2%. Soil erosion characteristics and enrichment ratios of organic carbon (EROC) and nitrogen (E-RN) were measured during 3 successive rainfall simulations at slope of 15 degrees and intensity of 120 mm h(-1). The water-stable aggregate distributionwas measured for soils before and after rainfall and drying. The mean weight diameter (MWD) of water-stable aggregate remained unchanged before (1.476 +/- 0.182) and after rainfall and drying (1.406 +/- 0.135 mm), but decreased for soils with higher organic carbon contents. Soil erodibility (K factor) averaged in 0.018 +/- 0.003, 0.011 +/- 0.001 and 0.008 +/- 0.001 in 3 successive rainfall events, with 42% and 27% decreases after each event, respectively (P < 0.05); and the decreases were greater for less aggregated soils or coarser textured soils. Stepwise regression showed that the <0.25 mm water-stable aggregate explained most variations of K and its dynamics. The EROC and E-RN were close to 1 andwere not correlated with clay content or MWD (P > 0.05). The E-RN decreased first and then remained stable, and EROC was unchanged during successive rainfalls. These results indicated that soil texture or aggregation status affected soil erodibility and its temporal changes in successive rainstorms. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Sun, JX; Yang, YL; Qi, P; Zhang, GX; Wu, Y				Sun, Jiaxin; Yang, Yanli; Qi, Peng; Zhang, Guangxin; Wu, Yao			Development and application of a new water-carbon-economy coupling model (WCECM) for optimal allocation of agricultural water and land resources	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												The optimal allocation of agricultural water and land resources is of great significance in ensuring sustainable food production and economic benefits of farmers. However, agriculture, as an important carbon cycle ecosystem, has paid limited attention to carbon sequestration in the optimal allocation of water and land resources. Therefore, this study developed a new water-carbon-economy coupling model (WCECM) for optimal allocation of agricultural water and land resources. In this model, the minimum water scarcity, maximum carbon sequestration and maximum economic benefits are taken as the optimization objectives. In addition, surface water volume and groundwater volume and planting area etc. were defined as constraints, respectively. Then, the model was solved using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III) and the Entropyweighted-TOPSIS evaluation method. The developed model was demonstrated in the largest Farm, Youyi Farm, which is one of commercial grain production base in China to analyze the optimization of water and land resources from 2010 to 2019. We found that the new WCECM, based on the simulation of a complex coupled water-carbon-economy system, can realize the optimal allocation of agricultural water and land resources to protect regional water resources, increase carbon sequestration and adjust the agricultural planting structure. In detail, through the multi-objective optimization model, the planting structure and the allocation ratio of surface water and groundwater irrigation water consumption are more suitable for this study area. After the optimization, the area planted with Rice was significantly reduced, the area planted with Maize was increased, and the area planted with Soybean did not change significantly compared with the first two crops. The planting structure has changed from focusing on paddy cultivation to dryland cultivation, with the ratio of Rice area, Maize area and Soybean area being 3:6:1. The water consumption is constrained within manageable limits, with an average annual irrigation water consumption of 2.01 x 108 m3. The amount of carbon sequestered has increased significantly, with an average annual increase of 7.8 x 108 kg. Meanwhile, the optimized economic benefits increased slightly, with a value of yen 2.35 billion. In short, optimization of water and land resources is beneficial for improving farmers' incomes, increasing carbon sequestration in agriculture, and conserving water resources.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				FEB 1	2024	291								108608	10.1016/j.agwat.2023.108608	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2023.108608		NOV 2023											WOS:001127552300001

Climate variables and vegetation are the main factors influencing the R. However, the effects of climate and vegetation changes on R are still poorly understood, especially in arid regions with limited water resources. This study quantifies the contribution of precipitation (PRE), potential evapotranspiration (ET0), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to R in Lake Issyk-Kul Basin (LIKB) dryland Central Asia by using the Budyko model. The results showed that R, PRE, and ET0 decreased from 2000 to 2020, while the NDVI and underlying parameter (omega) showed a slightly increasing trend. By using the Mann-Kendall (M-K) statistical approach, divided the R series into a baseline period (2000-2010) and a change period (2011-2020) based on the breakthrough point (2011). In the baseline period, R showed a decreasing trend, while in the change period, R showed an increasing trend of 1.8 mm/yr. The sensitivity analysis shows that a 1 mm increase in PRE results in a 0.48 mm increase in R (sensitivity coefficient to R is 0.48). Conversely, a 1 mm increase in ET0 (sensitivity coefficient to R of -0.03) and a 1 unit increase in NDVI (sensitivity coefficient to R of -343.31) lead to R decreasing by 0.03 and 343.31 mm, respectively. The relative contributions of PRE, ET0 and NDVI were 33.98%, -3.17% and 3.67%, respectively, suggesting that changes in PRE and NDVI contributed to the decrease in R while the opposite for ET0. PRE dominated the decrease in R, which decreased by 26.58 mm, leading to a decrease in R of 12.76 mm. A decrease of 65.33 mm in ET0 and an increase of 0.003 in NDVI resulted in an increase and decrease of 1.96 and 1.18 mm in R, respectively. This study enhances the understanding of the response of the water cycle to climate and vegetation changes in arid regions and can provide theoretical support for water resource management and ecological restoration.																				2296-6463				OCT 31	2023	11								1251759	10.3389/feart.2023.1251759	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2023.1251759													WOS:001100790100001

Soil enzyme activity can reflect the relationship between microbial nutrient demand and environmental nutrient availability. The experiment was established with a split-plot design, which included two main plots and two subplots. The main plots were 3 nitrogen levels (0, 150, 300 kg N ha(-1)). The two subplots were chemical fertilizer alone and combination of manure and inorganic application; the soil enzyme activity and chemical properties of each treatment were measured and analyzed. In the study, ecological enzyme stoichiometry was used to study the limitation of microbial resources in dryland wheat system. The results showed that the combined application of manure and chemical fertilizers did not significantly increase the activities of soil C, N and P cycling-related enzymes but decreased the activities of soil L-leucine aminopeptidase (LAP). Long-term application of organic fertilizer and mineral fertilizer significantly increased the accumulation of soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (TN) and increased soil microbial biomass (MBC, MBN). Organic fertilizer treatment significantly increased soil available phosphorus (AP) and soil NO3--N contents, and decreased SOC/AP and TN/AP, but had no significant changes under different nitrogen application levels (N0, N1, N2). GHG emissions were increaseed with the amount of nitrogen applied, the addition of manure did not significantly increase the CO2 and N2O emissions, and soil organic matter mineralization and gas emission fluxes decreased at ripen stage. The C-acquiring enzyme was negatively correlated with N-acquiring enzyme but positively correlated with P-acquiring enzyme. The microbial limiting effect of C and P on microbial metabolism becomes increasingly intense as the reproductive period progresses. Redundancy analysis of soil enzyme activities and chemical properties showed that soil TN and MBN could better explain the variation characteristics of soil enzyme activities. Therefore, the study of soil extracellular enzyme stoichiometry and microbial nutrient restriction can give us a more comprehensive understanding of the soil environment. There are more implications can be given under different nitrogen management modes and different growth stages. The results also provided an effective theoretical basis for regulating the changes of soil microbial environment.					wang, tao/HLG-5649-2023; Shi, Lei/HGB-5340-2022	Shi, Lei/0000-0003-1287-017X													0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2022	29	27					41520	41533		10.1007/s11356-021-18406-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-18406-1		JAN 2022						35094274					WOS:000749115300016

Much of the Basin's landscape and underlying groundwater is naturally saline with groundwater not being suitable for human or irrigation use. Since European settlement in the early 1800s, two actions-the clearance of deep-rooted native vegetation for dryland agriculture and the development of irrigation systems on the Riverine Plains and Mallee region-have resulted in more water now entering the groundwater systems, resulting in mobilization of the salt to the land surface and to rivers. While salinity has been a known issue since the 1960s, it was only in the mid-1980s that was recognized as one of the most significant environmental and economic challenges facing the MDB. Concerted and cooperative action since 1988 by the Commonwealth and Basin state governments under a salinity management approach implemented over the past 30 years has resulted in salinity now being largely under control, but still requiring on-going active management into the future. The approach has involved the development of three consecutive salinity strategies governing actions from 1988 to 2000, from 2001 to 2015, and the most recent from 2016 to 2030. The basis of the approach and all three strategies is an innovative, world-leading salinity management framework consisting of: An agreed salinity target; joint works and measures to reduce salt entering the rivers; and an agreed accountability and governance system consisting of a system of salinity credits to offset debits, a robust and agreed method to quantify the credits and debits, and a salinity register to keep track of credits and debits. This paper first provides background to the salinity issue in the MDB, then reviews the three salinity management strategies, the various actions that have been implemented through these strategies to control salinity, and the role of the recent Basin Plan in salinity management. We then discuss the future of salinity in the MDB given that climate change is forecast to lead to a hotter, drier and more variable climate (particularly more frequent droughts), and that increased salt loads to the River Murray are predicted to come from the lower reaches of the Mallee region. Finally, we identify the key success factors of the program.

Combinations of crop residue and fertilizer-N inputs can be used to manipulate soil-N supply factors at critical stages of plant N demand. The aim of this study was to understand the effects of residue and N fertilizer combinations on soil-N supply capacity to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop plants under field conditions. Residue decomposition and N release in the field during a fallow period and the subsequent wheat growing season were quantified using litterbags containing wheat or lupin residues placed in the top 1-2 cm of soil. During the growing season, surface (0-10 cm depth) soil-N capacity was assessed in relation to key wheat growth stages by measuring labile organic and inorganic soil-N pools under a combination of different residue (removed, wheat, or lupin residues) and fertilizer-N (0, 20, or 40 kg N ha(-1)) treatments applied at sowing. Around half of the N release by residues occurred in the fallow period. Lupin residues provided a greater N release via net mineralization and dissolved organic N (DON) early in the growing season (up to tillering). As the crop developed, lupin residues had a higher surface soil potentially mineralizable N (PMN) and microbial biomass N (MBN) compared with wheat or removed residues. It was the combination of lupin residues with fertilizer-N that had the highest overall amount of surface soil DON and PMN between seedling and tillering. This study showed that the fallow is an important component of the N cycle in these systems as 40-50% of crop residue N release occurred during this period. However, this release represented less than 15% of subsequent wheat crop N uptake, which highlights the importance of N cycling from recent residues and pre-existing organic matter during the crop growing season for meeting crop N demand. Lupin residues and fertilizer-N inputs, both independently and together, increased soil-N supply capacity at critical crop growth stages in this low-rainfall sandy soil environment.																			0718-9508	0718-9516				DEC	2021	21	4					2918	2931		10.1007/s42729-021-00578-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42729-021-00578-x		SEP 2021											WOS:000696772200001

Drought is one of the most important constraints limiting yield potential in crops and it is the major abiotic stress that can cause more than 70% yield loss in chickpea. In this study, a total of two hundred four chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) genotypes were selected to study the interaction between drought stress and nodule formation. This interaction was assessed by using morphological, yield and yield components. The field experiments were laid out in two locations (Terbol and Kfardan stations, Bekaa valley, Lebanon) using Alpha lattice design with two replications and two watering treatments (irrigation and rainfed) during 2016 and 2017 seasons. Parameters that were measured include days to 50% flowering (DFL), day to maturity (DM), plant height (PLH), nodule biomass (NB), nodule fresh weight (NFW), nodule dry weight (NDW), grain yield (GY), Biological yield (BY), 100 seed weight (100SW) and drought tolerance stress (DTS). The results indicated a significant variation between genotypes, environments and other morphological, yield and yield components traits. Drought stress reduced significantly the yield and the nodule's characteristics, biological and grain yield. The genotypes with the highest levels of drought tolerance, such as IG70399, IG8256, IG71832, IG70270, and IG70272, showed a minimal decrease in yield and nodule biomass. Nodule observations significantly and positively correlated with GY (0.36-0.38) under drought stress treatment. The correlation values for nodule characteristics with DFL and DM were higher under drought stress compared to irrigated conditions. This is a comparative study between drought stress and nodule formation traits associated with morphological, yield and yield components traits.

Changing cropping systems is an agronomic measure that potentially coordinates production and ecology. However, little evidence is available on the characteristics of changes in the soil moisture under different cropping systems and their relationships with cotton production. This study assessed the temporal and spatial variation in the soil moisture and analyzed the relationships between the soil water content (SWC) and the biomass, yield, and water use efficiency (WUE) of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in three cropping systems (monoculture cotton (MC), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/ delayed intercropped cotton (WIC), and wheat/direct-seeded cotton (WDC)). The spatiotemporal heterogeneity and autocorrelation of the soil moisture were affected by cropping systems and whether the soil was dry or wet. Compared with the values in 2016 (moist), the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the SWC variation at a 10???110 cm depth in the three planting systems increased, and the autocorrelation decreased in 2017 (drought). This phenomenon was more pronounced in WIC than in MC and WDC. Compared with MC, the double-cropping system increased the SWC between cotton rows. In the double-cropping system, the cotton yield of WIC was significantly higher than that of WDC. The order of WUE from high to low was WDC>MC>WIC in 2016 and MC>WIC>WDC in 2017, and no significant difference was observed between MC and WIC in both years. Yield limitation in the double-cropping system was due to weak water absorption of roots. The growth curves of cotton roots with increasing SWC in WIC were similar to those in MC, while WDC showed faster root growth but a smaller maximum value. The roots in WDC stopped growing when the water consumption reached 150 mm. WDC with a small root system was suitable for humid regions, while WIC with a strong root system should be promoted in both humid and arid regions. The methods and results can be used to obtain a deeper understanding of the effects of different planting systems on soil moisture and cotton production and to determine their interrelationship to guide dryland cotton production and precision agriculture.					li, xiao/HJP-5134-2023; Wu, Fengqi/GYJ-4781-2022; li, xiao/HKV-8405-2023; LI, XIAO/IQV-9318-2023; Li, xiaofei/GXF-7187-2022	Wu, Fengqi/0000-0002-6512-6830; 													0926-6690	1872-633X				OCT 15	2022	186								115259	10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.115259	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.115259													WOS:000854104000001

Even where people and carnivores have historically coexisted, traditional patterns of behavior toward large carnivores may be disrupted by wider processes of economic, social, political, and climate change. Conservation interventions have typically focused on changing behaviors of those living alongside large carnivores to promote sustainable practices. While these interventions remain important, their success is inextricably linked to broader socio-political contexts, including natural resource governance and equitable distribution of conservation-linked costs and benefits. In this context we propose a Theory of Change to identify logical pathways of action through which coexistence with large carnivores can be enhanced. We focus on Africa's dryland landscapes, known for their diverse guild of large carnivores that remain relatively widespread across the continent. We review the literature to understand coexistence and its challenges; explain our Theory of Change, including expected outcomes and pathways to impact; and discuss how our model could be implemented and operationalized. Our analysis draws on the experience of coauthors, who are scientists and practitioners, and on literature from conservation, political ecology, and anthropology to explore the challenges, local realities, and place-based conditions under which expected outcomes succeed or fail. Three pathways to impact were identified: (a) putting in place good governance harmonized across geographic scales; (b) addressing coexistence at the landscape level; and (c) reducing costs and increasing benefits of sharing a landscape with large carnivores. Coordinated conservation across the extensive, and potentially transboundary, landscapes needed by large carnivores requires harmonization of top-down approaches with bottom-up community-based conservation. We propose adaptive co-management approaches combined with processes for active community engagement and informed consent as useful dynamic mechanisms for navigating through this contested space, while enabling adaptation to climate change. Success depends on strengthening underlying enabling conditions, including governance, capacity, local empowerment, effective monitoring, and sustainable financial support. Implementing the Theory of Change requires ongoing monitoring and evaluation to inform adaptation and build confidence in the model. Overall, the model provides a flexible and practical framework that can be adapted to dynamic local socio-ecological contexts.

J	Nhemachena, CR; Muchara, B				Nhemachena, Charity R.; Muchara, Binganidzo			Structure of the sunflower plant breeders' rights landscape in South Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												Varietal innovations and protection of plant breeders' rights (PBRs) contribute to the development of any crop's ability to produce higher yields relatively consistently. Producing yields under adverse weather conditions and the overall characteristic of drought tolerance, make the sunflower an attractive crop for producers in dryland production regions. The main objective of this study was to give an overview of the structure of the South African sunflower breeding programme, focusing on the construction of PBRs and the leading players in sunflower breeding and seed production in South Africa. We compiled a detailed database of sunflower varietal innovations in South Africa from 1979 to 2019 using various sources such as the South African Grain Laboratory, the Department of Agriculture's Plant Variety Journals and the Crop Estimation Committee. This data set was then analysed using descriptive statistics and trend analysis to determine the main trends in ownership of PBRs and sunflower varieties. We looked at the inclusion of new sunflower varieties on the national variety list for sunflower varietal improvements in South Africa over this period. A total of 76 PBR sunflower varietal applications were lodged for the period - an average of 1.9 applications per year. The principal applicants for varietal inclusions on the national variety list were Pannar with 102 varieties (23.8%), Pioneer seeds with 51 varieties (11%), Saffola seed with 42 varieties (9.8%) and Agricultural Research Council with 10 varieties (2.3%). In order for breeders to benefit from their investment in research and avoid exploitation of their work, they need to be protected and receive returns on their investments. Innovation can be stimulated by proper collaboration between the private and public sectors, aided by broader variety sector legislation that encourages all players to invest. Significance: The study addresses the absence of empirical proof on the patterns and trends of sunflower varietal improvements in South Africa. The study provides evidence on the evolution of varietal rights, the extent of varietal rights granted, and which sunflower varieties were included on the national variety list and the breeders and owners of the varieties.

Limited research, however, has been carried out in arid or desert zones covered with sparse vegetation, despite the fact that these cover wide areas of the earth and play a significant role in global carbon cycles. In this study, the Otindag Sandy Land and its surroundings (OSLAIS) in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China was selected as the study area. The study introduces a useful technique for making high spatial coverage SOCD estimates for drylands by utilizing GF-1 WFV optical satellite images and a time series of MODIS satellite remote sensing datasets, and using these to optimize parameters for simulation models in conjunction with other technical procedures that are described. The results showed that the resulting model's accuracy was 77.87%, R-2 = 0.8627, and so the SOCD estimates modelled by soil basal respiration (SBR) could be used for SOCD estimation and for analyzing the spatial distribution patterns across the OSLAIS. The average SOCD was 1.22 kgC/m(2) for the whole of the OSLAIS, and it had a heterogenous distribution pattern. The SOCD was closely related to the way the land was used in each area, and the average SOCD for the main land use types were: forest land = 2.88 kgC/m(2), farmland = 1.63 kgC/m(2), shrub land = 1.41 kgC/m(2), and grassland = 1.08 kgC/m(2). In conclusion, we believe that the proposed method, based on high-resolution GF-1 WFV data and optimized estimation models constructed by integrating climate and vegetation characteristic data, can effectively describe the spatial distribution patterns of SOC and SOCD in the OSLAIS area, in depth and in detail, especially for the areas where the SOCD values are high. We expect this research to provide useful technical support and scientific reference data for land management and for land degradation/desertification assessments, for the study area monitored, as well as across the whole dryland area of China.

Furthermore, many dryland societies were also affected by seismic activity. The semi-arid Shiraki Plain in the tectonically active southeastern Caucasus is currently covered by steppe and largely devoid of settlements. However, numerous Late Bronze to Early Iron Age city-type settlements suggest early state formation between ca. 3.2-2.5 ka that abruptly ended after that time. A paleolake was postulated for the lowest plain, and nearby pollen records suggest forest clearcutting of the upper altitudes under a more humid climate during the Late Bronze/Early Iron Ages. Furthermore, also an impact of earthquakes on regional Early Iron Age settlements was suggested. However, regional paleoenvironmental changes and paleoseismicity were not systematically studied so far. We combined geomorphological, sedimentological, chronological and paleoecological data with hydrological modelling to reconstruct regional Holocene paleoenvironmental changes, to identify natural and human causes and to study possible seismic events during the Late Bronze/Early Iron Ages. Our results show a balanced to negative Early to Mid-Holocene water balance probably caused by forested upper slopes. Hence, no lake but a pellic Vertisol developed in the lowest plain. Following, Late Bronze/Early Iron Age forest clear-cutting caused lake formation and the deposition of lacustrine sediments derived from soil erosion. Subsequently, regional aridification caused slow lake desiccation. Remains of freshwater fishes indicate that the lake potentially offered valuable ecosystem services for regional prehistoric societies even during the desiccation period. Finally, colluvial coverage of the lake sediments during the last centuries could have been linked with hydrological extremes during the Little Ice Age. Our study demonstrates that the Holocene hydrological balance of the Shiraki Plain was and is situated near a major hydrological threshold, making the landscape very sensitive to small-scale human or natural influences with severe consequences for local societies. Furthermore, seismites in the studied sediments do not indicate an influence of earthquakes on the main and late phases of Late Bronze/Early Iron Age settlement. Altogether, our study underlines the high value of multi-disciplinary approaches to investigate human-environmental interactions and paleoseismicity in drylands on millennial to centennial time scales.

The role of microtopography and resident species in post-disturbance recovery of arid habitats in HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Habitat-suitability indices (HSI) have been employed in restoration to identify optimal sites for planting native species. Often, HSI are based on abiotic variables and do not include biotic interactions, even though similar abiotic conditions can favor both native and nonnative species. Biotic interactions such as competition may be especially important in invader-dominated habitats because invasive species often have fast growth rates and can exploit resources quickly. In this study, we test the utility of an HSI of microtopography derived from airborne LiDAR to predict post-disturbance recovery and native planting success in native shrub-dominated and nonnative, invasive grass-dominated dryland habitats in HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai. The HSI uses high-resolution digital terrain models to classify sites' microtopography as high, medium, or low suitability, based on wind exposure and topographic position. We used a split-plot before-after-control-impact design to implement a disturbance experiment within native shrub (Dodonaea viscosa) and nonnative, invasive grass (Cenchrus clandestinus)-dominated ecosystems across three microtopography categories. In contrast to previous studies using the same HSI, we found that microtopography was a poor predictor of pre-disturbance conditions for soil nutrients, organic matter content, or foliar C:N, within both Dodonaea and Cenchrus vegetation types. In invader-dominated Cenchrus plots, microtopography helped predict cover, but not as expected (i.e., highest cover would be in high-suitability plots): D. viscosa had the greatest cover in low-suitability and C. clandestinus had the greatest cover in medium-suitability plots. Similarly, in native-dominated Dodonaea plots, microtopography was a poor predictor of D. viscosa, C. clandestinus, and total plant cover. Although we found some evidence that microtopography helped inform post-disturbance plant recovery of D. viscosa and total plant cover, vegetation type was a more important predictor. Important for considering the success of plantings, percent cover of D. viscosa decreased while percent cover of C. clandestinus increased within both vegetation types 20 months after disturbance. Our results are evidence that HSIs based on topographic features may prove most useful for choosing planting sites in harsh habitats or those already dominated by native species. In more productive habitats, competition from resident species may offset any benefits gained from "better" suitability sites.

It is necessary to develop water-saving cultivation techniques in irrigation regions in northern China to relieve water scarcity. Planting and mulching on separate rows has been widely used to improve wheat yield and involves a pattern of a double row of planting and a blank row of mulching. However, whether the mulching pattern during the wheat season can be applied to the wheat-maize system to increase the yield of both crops and to reduce the use of irrigation water remains unclear. Three mulching practices (conventional planting (CP), conventional planting with mulching (CPM) and double-blank planting with mulching (DPM)) during the wheat season were conducted to verify the potential roles of DPM in increasing wheat and maize yields, improving soil temperature and enhancing water storage under the DPM practice. The results show that the DPM practice significantly increased the efficiency spike number, aboveground biomass and grain yield (7.8% higher than CP and 11.3% higher than CPM) of wheat. The heat conservation effect of the DPM practice was stronger in the early stage of growth and was more effective in minimizing fluctuations in soil temperature in the wheat season compared with CPM. The development and yield of maize that was sowed in the mulching lines of DPM were less improved, although the amount of aboveground biomass at the maturity stage was higher. Additionally, the soil temperature of the maize season under DPM showed a narrowing trend of changes during the early stage with slight effects in the middle stage and a resumption of heat conservation in the late stage. Compared with CP, both mulching patterns decreased soil evaporation during the two crops' seasons by an average 5.3% in CPM and 7.8% in DPM, which is particularly evident when the crops' leaf area index was low. Therefore, the DPM pattern could more effectively optimize soil temperature and water storage. Furthermore, this pattern may have positive effects on the yields of winter wheat and on reducing the soil water requirement of the maize season.					wang, KiKi/JFZ-3334-2023; Lu, Xiaomei/IUQ-2139-2023														0378-3774	1873-2283				MAR 1	2019	213						903	912		10.1016/j.agwat.2018.12.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2018.12.003													WOS:000457952700085

However, the co-occurrence pattern and community assembly process of denitrifier communities have not been studied in agricultural soils with long-term contrasting tillage histories. Based on a continuous (> 11 yr) conservation experiment, we aimed to understand the community assembly process and co-occurrence network of nirK-, nirS-, nosZI- and nosZII-type denitrifier communities under conservation tillage (i.e., zero tillage (ZT) and chisel plough tillage (CPT)) and conventional tillage (i.e., plow tillage (PT)). Continuous in situ measurements showed that long-term conservation tillage significantly decreased the denitrification potential and N2O emission fluxes. CPT and ZT significantly increased the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of nirK, nosZI, and nosZII type communities, whereas consistently decreased the diversity of nirS-type communities, compared with PT. Although the assembly of nirK, nirS, nosZI, and nosZII type denitrifier communities were dominated by stochastic processes, the relative importance of stochastic assembly of denitrifying microbial communities was higher in conservation tillage soil. The co-occurrence network analyses further revealed clear tillage-induced ecological functions of N2O emissions, as evidenced by lower key nodes abundance and robustness of nirS and nirK communities network and higher key nodes abundance and robustness of nosZI and nosZII communities in conservation tillage soils. Variation partitioning analysis further indicated that the assembly processes significantly changed soil N2O emission intensity by regulating alpha-diversity and the key species abundances in the co-occurrence network of denitrifying com-munities. Overall, conservation tillage practices increased the diversity and the key nodes abundance of nosZI- and nosZII-type communities and decreased the diversity and the key nodes abundance of nirS- and nirK-type communities by regulating the relative importance of the stochastic assembly process of denitrifier communities, which is eventually likely to curb N2O emissions by strengthening the capacity of the N2O sink and weakening the capacity of the N2O source. These findings provide new insights into the formation of dryland microbial communities in agricultural soils with long-term contrasting tillage histories. Especially considering future climate change, this knowledge would prove useful in improving agroecosystem productivity and curbing greenhouse gas emissions.					liu, lingling/IUQ-7478-2023; li, wei/IUQ-2973-2023; Wang, Weiyan/AAH-9378-2020; ZHOU, YUE/IZE-6277-2023; Liu, Yixuan/JFJ-2820-2023; li, yan/ITU-9719-2023; Yang, Ying/ADL-4165-2022; sun, chen/JCP-0396-2023; 李, 嘉馨/IWM-4023-2023; liu, xinyu/IWD-6630-2023; wang, zhiwen/JDV-9990-2023; Zhao, Yi/JFA-7988-2023; Wang, Guang/JFS-8374-2023; yang, yun/IZE-1092-2023; Yang, Fei/JLM-3367-2023; li, zhang/JHV-1750-2023	Wang, Weiyan/0000-0002-3281-0804; Yang, Ying/0000-0002-3469-7681; 													0167-8809	1873-2305				NOV 1	2022	339								108117	10.1016/j.agee.2022.108117	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2022.108117		AUG 2022											WOS:000869180700006

Impacts of a single fire event on large, old trees in a grass-invaded arid river system	FIRE ECOLOGY												Background Large old trees are keystone structures of terrestrial ecosystems that provide unique habitat resources for wildlife. Their widespread decline worldwide has serious implications for biodiversity and ecosystem integrity. In arid regions, large trees are relatively uncommon and often restricted to areas with elevated soil moisture and nutrients. Introduced grasses, now pervasive in many dryland environments, also thrive in such areas and are promoting more frequent and intense fire, potentially threatening the persistence of large trees. Here we report on the impact of a single wildfire on large river red gums (Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh.) in arid riparian woodland invaded by buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.), a serious invader of desert ecosystems worldwide. In 2018, 266 trees with > 80 cm equivalent trunk diameter were mapped at six sites to provide a 'pre-fire' baseline. Within a year, the sites were impacted by a large, unprecedented wildfire that burnt an area of 660 km(2) ha in 15 days. Sites were resurveyed in February 2019 to assess the fate of the trees. Reference to fire severity, calculated from remote-sensed imagery, is provided for additional context. Results In total, 67 trees, 27% of all large trees at the sites were destroyed. If trees in unburnt patches are excluded, 54% of trees exposed to the fire were destroyed and the remainder lost on average 79% of their canopy. Conclusions This severe detrimental effect of a single fire, on trees estimated to be centuries old, is indicative of tree-loss occurring across remote arid Australia in habitats where fire is now fuelled predominantly by invasive grasses. Large volumes of novel grass fuels along creeklines in combination with extreme weather events were major factors driving the spread, extent and impacts of the wildfire we report on and are causing a shift from relatively uncommon and predictable, rainfall-dependent large wildfires to large, severe fires that can occur anytime. We predict further decline in the abundance of large trees from similar fires will occur widely throughout arid Australia over the next decade with substantial long-term impacts on multiple species. New strategies are urgently required to manage fire in invaded arid ecosystems to better protect large trees and the critical resources they provide.

J	Shahsavari, F; Karandish, F; Haghighatjou, P				Shahsavari, Fahimeh; Karandish, Fatemeh; Haghighatjou, Parviz			Potentials for expanding dry-land agriculture under global warming in water-stressed regions: a quantitative assessment based on drought indices	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Agricultural sustainability under the warming climate highly depends on limiting the extreme use of the blue water resources within the irrigated lands, and instead, optimally applying green water resources within the expanded rainfed lands. In this research, potentials for expanding dry farming under climate change were analyzed in five climatic zones of Iran, based on the future projections of basic weather data and drought indices under 20 general circulation models (GCMs) and four emission scenarios, including RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.5, and RCP8.5. Drought indices included aridity index (AI), expressed as precipitation divided by evapotranspiration, and green water deficit (GWD), expressed as precipitation minus mines evapotranspiration. While annual predictions show a general increase in both precipitation and air temperature over the 2041-2070 period, given results at the monthly scale well revealed the spatial and temporal non-uniformity in the climate change projections. Such heterogeneities, together with those presented for different GCMs and RCPs, well indicated the importance of undertaking a wide range of uncertainties when implementing long-term planning. Based on GWD and AI, the arid and semi-arid regions, the backbone of the rainfed agriculture in Iran, are the most vulnerable to global warming. In these regions, green water availability will reduce by 0.8-167.5% especially within the wet seasons, and drought severity will increase by 0.1-33.2% through the rainfed cropping cycles. On the other hand, future climate may provide new opportunities for expanding dry farming within the hyper-arid region, which is now the most water-stressed region of the country. In this region, global warming projections show a positive increase of 0.3-146.2% in green water availability, and a reduction of 5.1-266.4% in drought severity. However, the humid region remained as the most suitable region for producing rainfed crops, although being widely allocated to irrigated-rice production under current condition. Based on the results, achieving sustainable dryland agriculture highly depends on regionally prioritizing susceptible area for dry farming, since the criteria indices showed an extreme spatial and temporal variability over the mid twenty-first century.																			0177-798X	1434-4483				JUL	2019	137	1-2					1555	1567		10.1007/s00704-018-2689-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-018-2689-9													WOS:000475737500108

The results will provide insights into water consumption by trees occupying different social positions of the forests. In the present study, an experiment was conducted in the Qilian Mountains, northwest China, and 13 trees, i.e., 4-5 trees from each one of dominant (the relative tree height (H-R) > 1.65), subdominant (1.25 < H-R <= 1.65) and intermediate-suppressed (H-R <= 1.25) layers) were chosen as sample trees in a pure Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifoliaKom.) forest stand. The sap flux density of sample trees, soil moisture of main root zone (0 to 60 cm) and meteorological conditions in open field were observed simultaneously from July to October of 2015 and 2016. The results showed that (1) The mean daily stand transpiration for the study period in 2015 and 2016 (July-October), was 0.408 and 0.313 mm center dot day(-1), and the cumulative stand transpiration was 54.84 and 40.97 mm, accounting for 24.14% (227.2 mm) and 16.39% (249.9 mm) of the total precipitation over the same periods, respectively. (2) The transpiration varied greatly among canopy layers, and the transpiration of the dominant and codominant layers was the main contributors to the stand transpiration, contributing 86.05% and 81.28% of the stand transpiration, respectively, in 2015 and 2016. (3) The stand transpiration was strongly affected by potential evapotranspiration (PET) and volumetric soil moisture (VSM). However, the transpiration of trees from the dominant and codominant layers was more sensitive to PET changes and that from the intermediate-suppressed layer was more susceptible to soil drought. This implied that in dry period, such as in drought events, the dominant and codominant trees would transpire more water, while the intermediate-suppressed trees almost stopped transpiration. These remind us that the canopy structure was the essential factor affecting single-tree and forest transpiration in the dryland areas.

Soil compaction can be mitigated by deep tillage and subsoiling practices following a long period of no-tillage. Fallow tillage rotation methods are frequently used to improve water availability in the soils of the southeastern Loess Plateau region of China. Rhizosphere soil bacteria are ecologically important for the transformation of matter and energy in the plant root system and can be influenced by tillage rotation treatments. However, the effect of tillage rotations on the bacterial community and structure of rhizosphere soil is not well understood. Methods. A two-year field experiment was conducted with four tillage rotation treatments, including subsoil-subsoil (SS-SS), subsoil-deep tillage (SS-DT), deep tillage-deep tillage (DT-DT), and the control treatment of no-tillage-no-tillage (NT-NT). Our study was conducted during wheat's fallow period to investigate the abundance, diversity, and functions of rhizosphere soil bacteria using high-throughput sequencing technology. Results. Our results showed that tillage rotation methods significantly influenced the bacterial diversity and composition of the rhizosphere soil in the plough layer (20-40 cm depth) by altering the moisture content of the soil. The metabolism, environmental information processing, and genetic information processing of the bacteria in the rhizosphere soil were affected. The most abundant phyla across all samples were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, Bacteroidetes, Gemmatimonadetes, Frimicutes, Chloroflexi, Nitrospirae, and Verrucomicrobia, which are classic bacterial decomposers in soil. The bacterial diversity and composition was similar for treatments causing higher soil perturbation (SS-DT and DT-DT), which disrupted the balance between aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The less disruptive tillage methods (SS-SS and NT-NT), preserved the integrity of the soil bacteria. However, the NT-NT treatment may have led to soil compaction, particularly in the 20-40 cm layer. These results suggested that SS-SS was the most effective tillage rotation practice to accumulate soil moisture, maintain the balance between aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and to enhance the metabolic capacity of rhizosphere soil bacteria. This method may have a significant impact on the sustainable development and farming practices of dryland agriculture.					liu, xiao/HMD-7454-2023; Liu, Xiaoli/HGE-7614-2022; liu, xiao/HKE-9880-2023	yang, zhenping/0000-0003-2991-3674													2167-8359					MAY 5	2020	8								e8853	10.7717/peerj.8853	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.8853								32411509					WOS:000530161100004

However, it is still unclear whether the current sowing date and sowing rate can adapt to future climate change, and how to adjust the sowing date and sowing rate to compensate for the adverse effects of climate change on wheat yields. This study predicts the adaptability of agricultural management practices like sowing dates and sowing rates, to future climate change in three wheat regions by referring to four global climate models (GCMs) and AquaCrop model. Population structure and yield were maximized for sowing dates from Oct.11-20 and sowing rates of 10-13 kg/667 m(2) (or 13-16 kg/667 m(2)) in 2016-2021. Three wheat regions were expected to show a warming trend, while the total precipitation has large spatial fluctuations under both representative concentration pathways (rcp) scenarios in the 2022-2100. AquaCrop model could simulate yield with a good precision (RMSE<1043.7 kg/ha). Compared to the average yield of the baseline period (2016-2021), in the 2022-2100, the average predicted wheat yields of three wheat regions simulated based on the current optimal sowing date and sowing rate decreased by 5.45 % similar to 11.05 % (9.35 % similar to 16.84 %) and 2.57 % similar to 10.95 % (6.97 % similar to 12.75 %) under the rcp4.5 (rcp8.5), respectively. Average wheat yield losses were effectively compensated when the combinations of Oct.15 and 14 kg/667 m(2) for the dryland wheat, Oct.21 and 14 kg/667 m(2) for the irrigated wheat, and Oct.21 and 13 kg/667 m(2) for the high-yield-rainfed wheat were applied under both rcp scenarios, respectively, with predicted yield losses of -4.17 %, -3.50 %, and -3.25 %. Thus, adjusting sowing dates and sowing rates are viable options to effectively address the adverse effects of future global climate change, thereby guaranteeing food security in the NCP.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				NOV 25	2023	901								165906	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165906	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165906		AUG 2023						37532040					WOS:001052449200001

Accumulation of organic carbon in various soil aggregate sizes under different land use systems in a semi-arid environment	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Aggregate-protected soil organic matter remains an important platform for organic carbon stabilisation and a sink for atmospheric CO2 emission, which play a crucial role in sustainable functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. This study was conducted to determine water stable soil aggregates, dry stable aggregates, and soil organic carbon (SOC) associated with aggregate sizes in surface (0-5 cm) and subsurface (5-15 cm and 15-30 cm) soil layers under four land use systems (forests, exclosures, grazing lands and cultivated lands) in the semi-arid northern Ethiopia. Dry- and wet-sieving analysis were applied to fractionate the soil into macroaggregates (> 0.25 mm) and microaggregates (< 0.25 mm). Particle size distribution and SOC content in macroaggregates and microaggregates (from which soil stability indices were developed) were determined using routine laboratory procedures. Result shows that land use systems had impact on soil aggregate distribution: microaggregates were dominant (more than 60 %) under cultivated land while macroaggregates were preponderant in grazing land (72-95 %). Aggregate stability index (ASI) followed the increasing order of grazing land > forest land/exclosure > cultivated land, in the surface layers, while structural stability index (SSI) was in the increasing order of forest > grazing land > exclosure > cultivated land for the top soils. SOC had strong and weak positive correlation with SSI and ASI respectively. This implies that SOC has more limited role in improving aggregation than other unexplained variables (not investigated in this study) like clay mineralogy, wettability characteristics, microbial activity and composition, and biotic factors in the study area. Correlation and regression analyses implied that dry-sieving of soil is as good as wet sieving in determining aggregate size distribution and soil aggregation in the study area. Therefore dry-sieving could be described as a "climate-smart" and quick sustainable alternative to the more time-consuming and tedious wet sieving method in a semi-arid dryland. Vegetation restoration improved soil organic carbon sequestration associated with aggregate sizes in the exclosures. Land use systems and management practices for reclamation of degraded land, in addition to changes in land use exerts positive and negative impacts on the organic carbon stock in soil aggregate fractions.

We used a social-ecological approach to assess how Prosopis juliflora (Prosopis henceforth), an invasive tree, affects the provision of multiple ecosystem services to different stakeholder groups in a degraded East African dryland. We combined plot-based ecological data on the impacts of the tree on indicators of ecosystem service supply with questionnaire survey data describing ecosystem service priorities from eight different stakeholder groups. These data were then used to quantify how tree invasion impacted individual ecosystem services, and the overall supply of services, relative to the priorities of each stakeholder group, using an ecosystem service multifunctionality metric. In the study area, we found that Prosopis significantly increased the supply of shade, wood production and honey production, but reduced the supply of water availability, tourism potential and biodiversity protection. Priorities for specific services differed between stakeholder groups. Although most groups assigned a high priority to provisioning services, such as water and crop production, it was either provisioning or cultural services which were a primary source of income, that were deemed most important. Combining supply and priority data showed that most stakeholder groups saw a net decrease in ecosystem service multifunctionality with increasing Prosopis invasion, or no significant change overall. Increasing Prosopis cover increased multifunctionality for only two stakeholder groups, charcoal producers and NGOs involved in regional development. Our research highlights the need to account for stakeholder priorities in studies of how global change impacts ecosystem multifunctionality. We found that there are conflicting patterns of ecosystem service priority between different stakeholder groups, resulting in large variation in how different groups were impacted by the invasive tree. Our approach also highlights possible synergies and conflicts when managing this tree invasion. More broadly, we recommend that future studies of ecosystem multifunctionality explicitly consider differing stakeholder priorities, as these strongly influence the perceived impact of environmental and land management change.

J	Baada, JN; Najjar, D; Seifu, MH				Baada, Jemima Nomunume; Najjar, Dina; Seifu, Mahelet Hailemariam			Can a cash crop be a women's crop?: Examining gender norms, relations and equity around lentil commercialization in Ethiopia	SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN												The benefits of subsistence-crop commercialization may depend on gender norms and relations. In sub-Saharan Africa, crop commercialization has been shown to often have unequal outcomes for women and men due to pre-existing social hierarchies and norms around farm roles, asset ownership, control over crops and income, and local farming practices. Using qualitative methods, this article examines gender norms and relations around lentil commercialization in the Amhara and Oromia regions of Ethiopia, to understand whether the benefits of market-orientated lentil production accrue to women and men farmers equitably. The findings reveal that despite naming lentils a women's crop, women remain marginalized from the sale and use of lentil. The study also found that lentil commercialization is often accompanied by labour commercialization, which has exclusionary effects on farmers of low socioeconomic status and unmarried women. Some policy recommendations are suggested based on these findings.																			2468-2276					SEP	2023	21								e01862	10.1016/j.sciaf.2023.e01862	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sciaf.2023.e01862		AUG 2023											WOS:001065069600001

However, it is challenging to use this method to restore biocrusts on a large-scale, because sand dunes have a complex morphology, and the angle of their varying slopes can expose biocrusts to wind speeds that delay or even prevent their development. In this study, we investigated how micro-topography, i.e. steepness of a sand dune's slope, affects cyanobacteria communities that incubate and restore biocrusts. We covered four different portions of a sand dune (which ranged between 2.3 degrees and 31.3 degrees of slope) with fine-soil substrate in the Tengger Desert, China, and then measured the cyanobacteria's colonization, development, and composition over three years as they formed biocrusts. The cyanobacteria successfully formed biocrusts on all sand dune slopes, and the greatest coverage (36.40 %), thickness (2.70 mm), biomass (22.38 mu g cm(-2)), and exopolysaccharide content (EPS, 306.49 mu g cm(-2)) occurred at the lowest degree of slope (2.3 degrees-5.6 degrees, dune-lowland), whereas the minimum coverage (4.90 %), thickness (1.62 mm), biomass (8.45 mu g cm(-2)), and EPS (160.89 mu g cm(-2)) occurred at the steepest degree of slope (25.3 degrees-31.3 degrees, dune-crest). These plots involved 20 genera of cyanobacteria, and Phormidium was the dominant genus, occupying >65 % of the species composition across all slope treatments. The steepness of a sand dune significantly and negatively influenced the biocrusts' coverage, thickness, chlorophyll a, and EPS (p < 0.05). Steepness was also negatively related to Phormidium (p < 0.05), but positively related to Crinalium, Sericytochromatia (p < 0.05), Chloroplast, and CENA359 (p < 0.10) genera. Our study demonstrated that covering sand with a fine-soil substrate can lead to the successful incubation of biocrusts. Further, the importance of the degree of sand dune slope demands further study to ensure maximum biocrusts restoration at a large scale. It will also be necessary to use a variety of cyanobacteria species in these future studies to achieve a broader knowledge of community functionality.					赵, 彦巧/GYR-3313-2022; Xu, Wenwen/AAD-9116-2019														0929-1393	1873-0272				AUG	2023	188								104874	10.1016/j.apsoil.2023.104874	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2023.104874		MAR 2023											WOS:000951610100001

Non-avian theropod phalanges from the marine Fox Hills Formation (Maastrichtian), western South Dakota, USA	PEERJ												We report here the first dinosaur skeletal material described from the marine Fox Hills Formation (Maastrichtian) of western South Dakota. The find consists of two theropod pedal phalanges: one recovered from the middle part of the Fairpoint Member in Meade County, South Dakota; and the other from the Iron Lightning Member in Ziebach County, South Dakota. Comparison with pedal phalanges of other theropods suggests strongly that the Fairpoint specimen is a right pedal phalanx, possibly III-2, from a large ornithomimid. The Iron Lightning specimen we cautiously identify as an ornithomimid left pedal phalanx II-2. The Fairpoint bone comes from thinly bedded and cross-bedded marine sandstones containing large hematitic concretions and concretionary horizons. Associated fossils include osteichthyan teeth, fin spines and otoliths, and abundant teeth of common Cretaceous nearshore and pelagic chondrichthyans. Leaf impressions and other plant debris, blocks of fossilized wood, and Ophiomorpha burrows are also common. The Iron Lightning bone comes from a channel deposit composed of fine to coarse sandstone beds, some of which contain bivalves, and a disseminated assemblage of mammal teeth, chondrichthyan teeth, and fragmentary dinosaur teeth and claws. We interpret the depositional environment of the two specimens as marginal marine. The Fairpoint bone derives from a nearshore foreset setting, above wave base subject to tidal flux and storm activity. The Iron Lightning specimen comes from a topset channel infill probably related to deposition on a tidal flat or associated coastal setting. The taphonomic history and ages of the two bones differ. Orthogonal cracks in the cortical bone of the Fairpoint specimen suggest post-mortem desiccation in a dryland coastal setting prior to transport and preservation in the nearby nearshore setting described above. The pristine surface of the Iron Lightning specimen indicates little transport before incorporation into the channel deposit in which it was found. The Fairpoint bone bed most probably lies within the Hoploscaphites nicolletii Ammonite Zone of the early late Maastrichtian, and would therefore have an approximate age of 69 Ma. The Iron Lightning bone is from the overlying H. nebrascensis Ammonite Zone, and is thus about one million years younger.

A field experiment was conducted in a semiarid desert steppe in Ningxia, China, to clarify the response patterns of ecosystem carbon fluxes along five levels of precipitation gradients (Simulating the natural precipitation percentages of 33 % (-33 %, 84 mm), 66 % (-66 %, 167 mm), 100 % (CK, 253 mm), 133 % (+33 %, 336 mm) and 166 % (+66 %, 420 mm) by rain shelters and sprinklers; CK is natural precipitation). The result showed that the trends of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) were consistent and those of ecosystem respiration (ER) and Soil respiration (SR) and autotrophic (Ra) and heterotrophic (Rh) components of SR were also consistent. NEE, ER, GEP and SR all reached their highest values in August. Changes in precipitation significantly affected ecosystem carbon fluxes, with NEE, ER and SR decreasing with decreasing precipitation and NEE, ER and GEP increasing with increasing precipitation. Soil respiration was more sensitive to the decreased precipitation treatment. During the growing season, NEE, ER, GEP, and SR were significantly positively correlated with precipitation, soil moisture (SM) and aboveground biomass (AGB). With the increase of precipitation variability, the promotion effect of increasing precipitation on GEP will exceed the promotion effect on ER, causing changes in carbon exchange and carbon sinks. Photosynthesis and respiration appeared tightly coupled, indicating that photosynthetic products regulate above- and belowground carbon cycling in semiarid steppe. Our study highlights the importance of water availability in carbon exchange processes in semiarid desert steppe of northern China. Decreased precipitation can lead to significant changes in SM and AGB, with negative impacts on GEP and SR, resulting in uncertainty in regional carbon sequestration. These findings will help us understand the vulnerability of semiarid steppe ecosystems under the influence of future precipitation changes and aim to provide a scientific reference for ecological management and restoration of semiarid desert steppes.

We isolated and identified eight DSE species (Acremonium nepalense, Acrocalymma vagum, Alternaria chartarum, Alternaria chlamydospora, Alternaria longissima, Darksidea alpha, Paraphoma chrysanthemicola, and Preussia terricola) colonizing the roots of wild licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis) in the desert areas of northwest China. Moreover, we investigated the osmotic stress tolerance of the DSE using pure culture, along with the performance of licorice plants inoculated with the DSE under drought stress in a growth chamber, respectively. Here, five species were first reported in desert habitats. The osmotic-stress tolerance of DSE species was highly variable, A. chlamydospora and P. terricola increased the total biomass and root biomass of the host plant. All DSE except A. vagum and P. chrysanthemicola increased the glycyrrhizic acid content; all DSE except A. chartarum increased the glycyrrhizin content under drought stress. DSE x watering regimen improved the glycyrrhizic acid content, soil organic matter, and available nitrogen. Structural equation model analysis showed that DSE x watering regimen positively affected soil organic matter, and total biomass, root length, glycyrrhizic acid, and glycyrrhizin (Shapotou site); and positively affected soil organic matter, available phosphorus, and glycyrrhizin (Minqin site); and positively affected the root length (Anxi site). DSE from the Shapotou site accounted for 8.0, 13.0, and 11.3% of the variations in total biomass, root biomass, and active ingredient content; DSE from the Minqin site accounted for 6.6 and 8.3% of the variations in total biomass and root biomass; DSE from the Anxi site accounted for 4.2 and 10.7% of the variations in total biomass and root biomass. DSE x watering regimen displayed a general synergistic effect on plant growth and active ingredient contents. These findings suggested that the DSE-plant interactions were affected by both DSE species and DSE originating habitats. As A. chlamydospora and P. terricola positively affected the total biomass, root biomass, and active ingredient content of host plants under drought stress, they may have important uses as promoters for the cultivation of licorice in dryland agriculture.																				1664-302X				JUN 23	2021	12								522449	10.3389/fmicb.2021.522449	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.522449								34248857					WOS:000670073800001

Finding woodlands in drylands: Bases for the monitoring of xeric open forests in a cloud computing platform	REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT												Conservation and sustainable management of woodlands in drylands is a priority at the global level considering the numerous benefits and ecosystem services they offer for local people. Sustainable use of forest resources requires the planning of forest conservation, restoration, and use on a global scale through National Forest Plans. It is imperative to generate information about their location and main characteristics to develop such plans. In this context, satellite imagery presents invaluable advantages related to the possibility of covering greater extensions in less time using fewer resources. However, there is limited knowledge about dryland woodlands spatial distribution due to the challenges associated with their identification. Particular features of these forests may conceal them from remote sensors. In Argentina's drylands, the detection of Monte biogeographical province's woodlands is hindered due to the spectral confusion that takes place between them and the surrounding shrubland. The objective of this study was to assess and compare different methodologies in a web-based image processing platform to develop a monitoring methodology easy to apply by public offices. We selected two study areas in the Monte region where we performed and assessed 16 types of supervised image classifications. In drier sites characterized by high contrast between woodlands and surrounding areas, forest detectability improved. In both study areas, we found better results using higher resolution images. The improvement associated with the inclusion of a vegetation index, as well as the classification algorithm and scheme implemented was case-dependent. In both study areas, classifications detected non-forest areas more accurately, indicating the possible application of the assessed procedures for the monitoring of forest loss. The cloud computing platform proved very useful and included multiple advantages. Bases for the detection of woodlands in drylands emerge from this study, considering improvements in accuracy and suitable alternatives: the use of Sentinel images, the addition to the mosaic of the SATVI index, the use of the CART algorithm, and a detailed classification scheme. These do not intend to be rigid instructions, but baseline recommendations to orient the design of monitoring approaches of these hidden forests.

J	Masereka, EM; Ochieng, GM; Snyman, J				Masereka, Eric M.; Ochieng, George M.; Snyman, Jacques			Frequency analysis of agricultural drought of maize in Sabie River catchment in South Africa	JAMBA-JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK STUDIES												Maize (Zea mays L.) is a staple food in South Africa. Under dryland farming, drought is a major limiting factor for maize production. The yield of maize is drastically reduced when rainfall is limited and erratic during the growing season. In order to formulate strategies of reducing the impact of drought on maize production, it is necessary to analyse the magnitude and frequency of drought. The objective of this study was to carry out the magnitude and frequency analysis of agricultural drought events of maize in the Sabie River catchment in order to formulate methods of reducing the impact of drought on maize production in the catchment. The maize growing season in the Sabie River catchment begins in October and ends in February the following year. In this study, the maize growing season was divided into three growing periods based on the month maize is planted. The growing periods were: October to December, November to January and December to February. Simple water balance model in the root zone was applied to determine the minimum amount of rainfall required to meet the water requirement of maize in each growing period in all the eight rainfall zones into which the Sabie River catchment is divided. Empirical frequency analysis and stochastic frequency analysis of the agricultural drought events of maize were carried out. From the study, the return period of agricultural drought events of maize was found to be different for each rainfall zone, and the growing period ranges from 1.78 years to 2.68 years. These results are important for hydrological modellers in that they show that it is necessary to determine the best fit probability distribution for frequency analysis of hydrological events rather than assuming one as the best fit. In all rainfall zones, maize was least prone to drought in the growing period of October to December. Based on the results of the study, development of water resource infrastructure for irrigation and adoption of drought-tolerant varieties of maize was recommended to reduce the high risk of agricultural drought of maize in the Sabie River catchment.

Increased soil temperature and decreased precipitation during early life stages constrain grass seedling recruitment in cold desert restoration	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												Seed-based restoration is one of the most difficult challenges for dryland restoration. Identifying environmental conditions that drive variation in seed and seedling mortality across similar restoration efforts could increase understanding of when and where restoration outcomes are likely to be favourable and identify new tools and strategies to improve outcomes. We asked how variation in a suite of environmental predictors influenced germination, emergence, seedling establishment and juvenile survival of four commonly sown perennial grass species across 33 seeding experiments distributed over an ~160,000-km(2) area of the Great Basin, a cold desert system in the western United States. Across experiments, we observed wide variation in the rates of four demographic transitions and wide variation in environmental conditions experienced by plants at each stage. For all species, higher precipitation during the first 30 days following seeding was associated with an increase in germination. Conversely, higher soil temperature over this same time period was associated with a significant decrease in germination and emergence, and soil temperature was associated with a substantial portion of the variation in germination and emergence probabilities observed across our seeding experiments. Within the range of precipitation variation observed, we were unable to detect a significant relationship between seedling establishment the first growing season and cumulative precipitation the first year, precipitation during the first spring growing season or annual climatic water deficit (CWD) the first year. Higher CWD the second growing season reduced seedling survival over that time period. Synthesis and applications. Our results show higher soil temperature negatively impacts grass seedling establishment. Restoration efforts should be prioritized when seasonal or subseasonal temperature forecasts indicate likely periods of below average temperatures. These results also indicate that climate warming will make restoration even more difficult, with our model estimates suggesting the 2 degrees C increase in temperature expected in the Great Basin over the coming decades will decrease germination and emergence by about 30%. Lastly, while our field-based approach provided insight into short-term drivers of mortality, it did not provide insight into drivers of longer term survival, suggesting a need for further work on predicting long-term restoration outcomes.

To explore high-yield, efficient and green production technology for oilseed flax in dryland agricultural areas, a field split plot experiment was conducted in the semi-arid area of the Loess Plateau in northwest China from April to August in 2020 and 2021. The study compared and analyzed the effects of different nutrient sources and their application rates on water consumption characteristics, grain yield and water use efficiency of oilseed flax. The main plots were fertilizer types (sheep manure, chicken manure and chemical fertilizer), while the subplots were fertilizer application rates (sheep manure: S1-12,500 kg & BULL;hm(-2) and S2-25,000 kg & BULL;hm(-2); chicken manure: C1-5800 kg & BULL;hm(-2) and C2-11,600 kg & BULL;hm(-2); chemical fertilizer: F1-N 112.5 kg & BULL;hm(-2), P 75 kg & BULL;hm(-2), K 67.5 kg & BULL;hm(-2) and F2-N 225 kg & BULL;hm(-2), P2O5 150 kg & BULL;hm(-2), K2O 135 kg & BULL;hm(-2)). The results showed that compared with chemical fertilizers, organic fertilizers significantly increased the soil water storage capacity of the 0-160 cm soil layer during the whole growth period of oilseed flax and significantly reduced water consumption. During two growing seasons, the application of 25,000 kg & BULL;hm(-2) sheep manure significantly reduced water consumption during the seedling-bud period and green fruit period-maturity period of oilseed flax by 16.13% and 23.19% compared with CK, respectively. Thousand-grain weight, yield and water use efficiency were significantly increased by 14.70%, 48.32% and 61.29%, respectively. These results indicate that the application of 25,000 kg & BULL;hm(-2) sheep manure can significantly increase soil water storage capacity of the 0-160 cm soil layer, reduce water consumption during the whole growth period of oilseed flax and thus improve grain yield and water use efficiency of oilseed flax. It is a suitable fertilization technology for the high-yield, efficient and green production of oilseed flax in the semi-arid areas of northwest Loess Plateau.																				2073-4395				JUL	2023	13	7							1755	10.3390/agronomy13071755	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13071755													WOS:001034773100001

Genotypes	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Sesame is predominantly cultivated in rainfed and low fertile lands and is frequently exposed to terminal drought. Sesamum species inhabiting dryland ecosystems adaptively diverge from those inhabiting rainfed habitats, and drought-specific traits have a genetic basis. In sesame, traits associated with drought conditions have not been explored to date, yet studies of these traits are needed given that drought is predicted to become more frequent and severe in many parts of the world because of climate change. Here, 76 accessions from the available Indian core set were used to quantify variation in several traits under irrigated (WW) and terminal drought stress (WS) conditions as well as their association with seed yield over two consecutive years. The range of trait variation among the studied genotypes under WW and WS was significant. Furthermore, the traits associated with seed yield under WW and WS differed. The per se performance of the accessions indicated that the expression of most traits was reduced under WS. The correlation analysis revealed that the number of branches, leaf area (LA), leaves dry weight (LDW), number of capsules plant(-1), and harvest index (HI) were positively correlated with seed yield under WW and WS, and total dry matter (TDM), plant stem weight, and canopy temperature (CT) were negatively correlated with seed yield under WW and WS, indicating that smaller and cooler canopy genotypes had higher yields. The genotypes IC-131936, IC-204045, IC-204861, IC-205363, IC-205311, and IC-73576 with the highest seed yields were characterized by low canopy temperature, high relative water content, and high harvest index under WS. Phenotypic and molecular diversity analysis was conducted on genotypes along with checks. Phenotypic diversity was assessed using multivariate analysis, whereas molecular diversity was estimated using simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci to facilitate the use of sesame in breeding and genetic mapping. SSRs showed low allelic variation, as indicated by a low average number of alleles (2.31) per locus, gene diversity (0.25), and polymorphism information content (0.22). Cluster analysis (CA) [neighbor-joining (NJ) tree] revealed three major genotypic groups and structure analysis showed 4 populations. The diverse genotypes identified with promising morpho-physiological traits can be used in breeding programs to develop new varieties.

Numerous studies have been conducted on the identification, isolation of a chromosome region (Gpc-B1) of Wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum spp. dicoccoides) and its introgression into commercial hard wheat to GPC. Yet there has been limited research published on the comparative responsiveness of these altered lines and their parents to varied N supply. There is increased awareness that wheat genetic improvements must be assessed over a range of environmental and agronomic management conditions to assess stability. We report herein on economically optimal yield, protein and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) component responses of two Pacific Northwestern USA cultivars, Tara and Scarlet compared to backcrossed derived near isolines with or without the Gpc-B1 allele. A field experiment with 5 N rates as whole plots and 8 genotypes as subplots was conducted over two years under semi-arid, dryland conditions. One goal was to evaluate the efficacy of the Gpc-B1 allele under a range of low to high N supply. Across all genotypes, grain yield responses to N supply followed the classic Mitscherlich response model, whereas GPC followed inverse quadratic or linear responses. The Gpc-B1 introgression had no major impact on grain protein, but grain N and total above ground crop N yields demonstrated quadratic responses to total N supply. Generally, higher maximum grain yields and steeper rise to the maxima (Mitscherlich c values) were obtained in the first site-year. Tara required less N supply to achieve GPC goals than Scarlet in both site-years. Genotypes with Gpc-B1 produced comparable or slightly lower Mitscherlich A values than unmodified genotypes, but displayed similar Mitscherlich c values. Target GPC goals were not achieved at economic optimal yields based on set wheat pricing. Economic optimization of N inputs to achieve protein goals showed positive revenue from additional N inputs for most genotypes. While N uptake efficiency did not drop below 0.40, N fertilizer-induced increases in grain N harvest correlated well with unused post-harvest soil N that is potentially susceptible to environmental loss.																			1664-462X					FEB 25	2020	10								1790	10.3389/fpls.2019.01790	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2019.01790								32158450					WOS:000524721400001
J	Harries, M; Flower, KC; Scanlan, CA; Rose, MT; Renton, M				Harries, Martin; Flower, Ken C.; Scanlan, Craig A.; Rose, Michael T.; Renton, Michael			Interactions between crop sequences, weed populations and herbicide use in Western Australian broadacre farms: findings of a six-year survey	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE												Six years of survey data taken from 184 paddocks spanning 14 million ha of land used for crop and pasture production in south-west Western Australia were used to assess weed populations, herbicide resistance, integrated weed management (IWM) actions and herbicide use patterns in a dryland agricultural system. Key findings were that weed density within crops was low, with 72% of cropping paddocks containing fewer than 10 grass weeds/m(2) at anthesis. Weed density and herbicide resistance were not correlated, despite the most abundant grass weed species (annual ryegrass, Lolium rigidum Gaudin) testing positive for resistance to at least one herbicide chemistry in 92% of monitored paddocks. A wide range of herbicides were used (369 unique combinations) suggesting that the diversity of herbicide modes of action may be beneficial for reducing further development of herbicide resistance. However, there was a heavy reliance on glyphosate, the most commonly applied active ingredient. Of concern, in respect to the evolution of glyphosate resistant weeds, was that 45% of glyphosate applications to canola were applied as a single active ingredient and area sown to canola in Western Australia expanded from 0.4 to 1.4 million hectares from 2005 to 2015. In order to minimise the weed seed bank within crops, pastures were used infrequently in some regions and in 50% of cases pastures were actively managed to reduce weed seed set, by applying a non-selective herbicide in spring. The use of non-selective herbicides in this manner also kills pasture plants, consequently self-regenerating pastures were sparse and contained few legumes where cropping intensity was high. Overall, the study indicated that land use selection and utilisation of associated weed management actions were being used successfully to control weeds within the survey area. However, to successfully manage herbicide resistant weeds land use has become less diverse, with pastures utilised less and crops with efficacious weed control options utilised more. Further consideration needs to be given to the impacts of these changes in land use on other production factors, such as soil nutrient status and plant pathogens to assess sustainability of these weed management practices in a wider context.

This pattern has been explained with scale-dependent ecohydrological feedbacks and the reaction-diffusion, or Turing mechanism, used in process-based models that are rooted in physics and pattern-formation theory. However, a detailed ecological test of the validity of the modelled processes is still lacking. Here, we test in a spinifex-grassland ecosystem of Western Australia the presence of spatial feedbacks at multiple scales. Drone-based multispectral analysis and spatially explicit statistics were used to test if grass vitality within five 1-ha plots depends on the pattern of FCs that are thought to be a critical extra source of water for the surrounding matrix vegetation. We then examined if high- and low-vitality grasses show scale-dependent feedbacks being indicative of facilitation or competition. Additionally, we assessed facilitation of grass plants for different successional stages after fire at fine scales in 1-m(2)quadrats. Finally, we placed soil moisture sensors under bare soil inside the FC gap and under plants at increasing distances from the FC to test if there is evidence for the 'infiltration feedback' as used in theoretical modelling. We found that high-vitality grasses were systematically more strongly associated with FCs than low-vitality grasses. High-vitality grasses also had highly aggregated patterns at short scales being evidence of positive feedbacks while negative feedbacks occurred at larger scales. Within 1-m(2)quadrats, grass cover and mutual facilitation of plants was greater near the FC edge than further away in the matrix. Soil moisture after rainfall was lowest inside the FC with its weathered surface crust but highest under grass at the gap edge, and then declined towards the matrix, which confirms the infiltration feedback. Synthesis. The study shows that FCs are a critical extra source of water for the dryland vegetation, as predicted by theoretical modelling. The grasses act as 'ecosystem engineers' that modify their hostile, abiotic environment, leading to vegetation self-organization. Overall, our ecological findings highlight the validity of the scale-dependent feedbacks that are central to explain this emergent grassland pattern via the reaction-diffusion or Turing-instability mechanism.

Rethinking the potential productivity of crassulacean acid metabolism by integrating metabolic dynamics with shoot architecture, using the example of <i>Agave tequilana</i>	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												circle Terrestrial CAM plants typically occur in hot semiarid regions, yet can show high crop productivity under favorable conditions. circle To achieve a more mechanistic understanding of CAM plant productivity, a biochemical model of diel metabolism was developed and integrated with 3-D shoot morphology to predict the energetics of light interception and photosynthetic carbon assimilation. circle Using Agave tequilana as an example, this biochemical model faithfully simulated the four diel phases of CO2 and metabolite dynamics during the CAM rhythm. After capturing the 3-D form over an 8-yr production cycle, a ray-tracing method allowed the prediction of the light microclimate across all photosynthetic surfaces. Integration with the biochemical model thereby enabled the simulation of plant and stand carbon uptake over daily and annual courses. circle The theoretical maximum energy conversion efficiency of Agave spp. is calculated at 0.045-0.049, up to 7% higher than for C-3 photosynthesis. Actual light interception, and biochemical and anatomical limitations, reduced this to 0.0069, or 15.6 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) dry mass annualized over an 8-yr cropping cycle, consistent with observation. This is comparable to the productivity of many C-3 crops, demonstrating the potential of CAM plants in climates where little else may be grown while indicating strategies that could raise their productivity.

Seed transmission of bean common mosaic virus - blackeye cowpea mosaic strain (BCMV-BICM) threaten cowpea seed health in the Ashanti and Brong-Ahafo regions of Ghana	JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCES												Antigen-coated plate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ACP-ELISA) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to detect the presence and seed transmissibility of bean common mosaic virus-blackeye cowpea mosaic (BCMV-BICM) in farm- retained cowpea seed lots obtained from 46 locations, including markets and farms in major cowpea growing areas in the Ashanti and Brong Ahafo regions of Ghana. In the growout tests, virus symptomatic plants were observed in seedlings of 19 of the 46 seed lots tested under insect-proof screen-house conditions. All the symptomatic plants tested positive to polyclonal antiserum raised against BCMV-BICM in ACP-ELISA. The seed transmission rates based on symptoms ranged from 0 to 37.8 %. RT-PCR with primer pair designed to amplify the potyvirus Cylindrical Inclusion (CI) region resulted in an expected 720 bp DNA segment in 19 seed lots as a further confirmation of virus in the seed lots. The remaining 27 lots were asymptomatic and tested negative to BCMV-BICM in both ACP-ELISA and RT-PCR. The findings of this study revealed seed as the source of primary inoculum in the farmers' fields and may aid in the implementation of control strategies such as discouraging farmers from retaining their own seeds for subsequent sowing and encouraging them to take appropriate measures in obtaining virus-free cowpea seeds from other sources.																			0973-354X	2582-4899				DEC	2021	16	2					251	260																WOS:000893655500014

J	Zou, MZ; Deng, YY; Du, TS; Kang, SZ				Zou, Minzhong; Deng, Yaoyang; Du, Taisheng; Kang, Shaozhong			Agricultural transformation towards delivering deep carbon cuts in China's arid inland areas	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												Since agriculture is a main source of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, reducing agricultural GHG emis-sions is crucial for achieving global climate goals. Nevertheless, there has been a lack of thorough and systematic assessment of the spatiotemporal distribution of agricultural GHG emissions at the county level, considering many factors such as crop and livestock products, different processes and gases, and the impact of carbon fix-ation. Furthermore, the potential of comprehensive technical strategies to reduce GHG emissions remains un-certain. Considering the unique attributes of agricultural development in arid areas of northwest China, this study aimed to explore long-term changes in agricultural net GHG emissions by county, product group, process, and gas and quantify the future reduction potential based on the Agricultural System-induced GreenHouse Gases INVentory (ASGHG-INV) econometric model. The results showed increasing trends in carbon emissions (CE), carbon sequestration (CS), carbon footprint (CF), crop carbon footprint per unit area (CFCF), and crop carbon footprint per unit product (CPCF) in various regions from 1991 to 2019, while there was a decreasing trend in livestock carbon footprint per unit product (LPCF). Focus on reducing GHG emissions in the crop-sector should be in Shihezi, Alaer, and Liangzhou; those of the livestock-sector should be in Xinyuan, Yecheng, Liangzhou, and Gaotai. Scenario analysis indicated that agricultural transformation could substantially reduce GHG emissions in all regions. Reducing the loss of reactive nitrogen was shown to be the most effective single strategy for reducing crop emissions. A comprehensive scheme further integrating the optimization of nitrogen fertilizer management, increasing water-saving, manure application, and straw returning measures, and using biochar and inhibitors can decrease CE, CF, CFCF, and CPCF by 22.62-43.45%, 40.55-111.60%, 41.38-111.78%, and 43.33-111.32%, respectively, increase CS by 9.07-39.97%. Optimizing forage composition was the most influential strategy for reducing livestock GHG emissions. The integrated strategy of further using forage additives, breeding low -emission varieties, and optimizing fecal management can reduce CF and LPCF by 37.32-76.42% and 40.51-78.70%, respectively. This study's results can be a reference for developing more effective GHG emissions reduction and green transformation pathways for global dryland agriculture.																			0160-4120	1873-6750				OCT	2023	180								108245	10.1016/j.envint.2023.108245	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2023.108245		OCT 2023						37806156					WOS:001089288100001

Where the water goes: Partitioning surface flow and streambed infiltration in an ephemeral river laboratory experiment	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Ephemeral and intermittent flow in dryland streams plays a vital role in supporting delicate ecosystems and recharging groundwater in underlying aquifers. Despite extensive research, accurately predicting surface runoff, streambed water infiltration, and groundwater recharge during ephemeral streamflow events remains challenging due to the complex physical processes involved. Such processes are logistically difficult to observe in the field and should not be assessed through numerical studies alone. To tackle this complexity, we utilized an 8 m long, 0.25 m wide, and 0.6 m deep laboratory flume filled with fine sand as a physical model for event flows along a dry stream. This flume allowed us to measure both streamflow and streambed infiltration volumetrically as the stream wetting front advanced along its length during 8 steady inflow rates. The flume was divided into separate compartments to measure water across the sediment surface (streamflow) and water exiting through the flume's bottom (groundwater recharge). To validate our physical tests, we compared them with simulated flows in an integrated surface-subsurface hydrological numerical model. The model results exhibited good agreement with the observed stream and groundwater dynamics. Through a parametric numerical investigation, we identified that hydraulic conductivity significantly controlled the rate of surface infiltration and the advancement of the stream wetting front. Interestingly, we found a linear relationship between surface discharge and stream wetting front location, as well as groundwater recharge, under steady-state conditions, in line with the governing equations. However, our simulations of variable streambed heterogeneity and elevation unveiled the crucial influence of these factors in determining the timing of downstream flow progression. This insight is essential for establishing ecological connectivity along non-perennial rivers and has significant implications for delivering environmental flows in arid regions where ephemeral rivers are prevalent. Our study underscores the value of flume experiments in elucidating the transient physical processes during surface water and groundwater interactions in intermittent streams. By employing a combination of physical modelling and numerical simulations, we advance our understanding of these vital hydrological interactions, contributing to sustainable water management practices in semi-arid and arid environments.					; Rau, Gabriel/J-8763-2014; /W-1205-2018	Partington, Daniel/0000-0003-2266-824X; Shanafield, Margaret/0000-0003-1710-1548; Felder, Stefan/0000-0003-1079-6658; Rau, Gabriel/0000-0003-4641-5255; /0000-0002-2431-7649													0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2023	626		A						130159	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.130159	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.130159		SEP 2023											WOS:001084344700001

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR) has the largest area ratio of semi-arid regions in China, and spring wheat is one of its major grain crops, and the negative impacts of climate change pose a serious threat to its production. In order to reduce this threat, we assessed the impact thresholds and risks posed by the main climatic factors to spring-wheat production, and put forward quantitative adaptive countermeasures. The results showed that, from 1961 to 2012, the appropriate impact thresholds of average temperature, precipitation, fertilization level, and water supply level were 15.6 degrees C, 333 mm, 319.5 kg/ha, and 743.7 mm, respectively. Compared with the average values in 1996-2012, the maximum fertilization level and water supply level could be increased by 162.2 kg/ha and 406.5 mm, respectively, to improve the adaptive yield of spring wheat. The risks of adverse impacts of temperature rise, precipitation decrease, and their combined effect on spring-wheat production were found to be 11.1%, 9.3%, and 10.3%, respectively. The whole IMAR showed a high risk of adverse impacts of temperature rise and the combined action of temperature rise and precipitation decrease on spring-wheat production. In particular, the spring-wheat production in the northeastern, eastern, and central areas were found to be at the highest risk to the impacts of climate change. Based on the determined appropriate thresholds of fertilization level and water supply level, it was determined that in the northeastern area, the maximum fertilization level and water supply level could be increased by 229.9 kg/ha and 441.4 mm, respectively, to increase the adaptive yield of spring wheat. In the eastern area, the two factors could be increased by 142.2 kg/ha and 464.3 mm, respectively. In the central area, they could be increased by 242.2 kg/ha and 513.7 mm, respectively. In the southwestern area, they could be increased by 41.4 kg/ha and 201.7 mm, respectively.																			0177-798X	1434-4483				AUG	2022	149	3-4					1391	1403		10.1007/s00704-022-04119-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-022-04119-z		JUN 2022											WOS:000811948900001

However, the specific mechanisms underlying these processes remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the influence of microbial anabolism versus catabolism and iron (Fe)-mediated soil organic carbon (SOC) protection versus decomposition on the topsoil carbon sequestration efficiency (CSE) of exogenous organic amendments in a rice-wheat cropping system subjected to nine years of no fertilizer (CT), chemical fertilizer (CF), 50% CF plus pig manure compost (CFM), 100% CF plus straw (CFS), 50% CF plus pig manure compost and straw (CFMS), and 87.5% CF plus pig manure compost (OICF) amendments. The CSE under CT and CFM was approximately 1.5-to 2.4-fold higher than that under the other four treatments. A structural equation model indicated that Fe-mediated free radical reactions and exogenous carbon inputs were negatively correlated with CSE, whereas soil microorganisms were positively correlated with CSE. Microbial biomass carbon and Fe-bound organic carbon were higher while the metabolic quotient, the ratio of microbial carbon-use efficiency to nitrogen-use efficiency and the percentage of Fe-bound organic carbon to SOC were lower under CFM and CFMS than under CF, CFS and OICF. The concentrations of ferrous Fe, oxalate-extractable Fe oxides, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals were lower, but the activity of catalase was higher under CFM and CFMS than under CF, CFS and OICF. Therefore, partial substitution of chemical fertilizer with compost enhances topsoil CSE in three ways: directly through the input of refractory organic carbon, indirectly through improving the microbial substrate-use efficiency, and to a lesser extent through promoting the formation of organo-Fe complexes and accelerating the decay of hydrogen peroxide, thereby possibly serving as a management tool for attenuating terrestrial carbon-climate feedbacks.

This study was conducted to better understand the forage quantity and quality traits to enhance the feed value of this crop. Two sets of pearl millet hybrids (80 single cross hybrids in Set-I and 50 top cross hybrids in Set-II) along with their parents evaluated multi-locationally for the forage-linked traits under multi-cut (two cuts) system revealed significant variability for the forage traits in the hybrids and parents. The mean better parent heterosis (BPH) for total dry forage yield (TDFY) was 136% across all the single cross hybrids and 57% across all the top cross hybrids. The mean BPH for in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) varied from -11 to 7% in the single cross hybrids and -13 to 11% in the top cross hybrids across cuts. The findings of TDFY and IVOMD heterosis in these sets indicated the potential of improvement of the hybrid cultivars for forage quantity and quality in forage pearl millet. The parental lines single cross parent (SCP)-L02, SCP-L06, and top cross parent (TCP)-T08 found superior in the forage quantity and quality traits can be utilized in the future breeding programs. Most of the forage traits were found to be controlled by using the non-additive gene action. A diverse panel of 105 forage-type hybrid parents (Set-III) genotyped following genotyping by sequencing (GBS) and phenotyped for crude protein (CP) and IVOMD under multi-cuts for 2 years identified one stable significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on LG4 for CP, and nine SNPs for IVOMD distributed across all the linkage groups except on LG2. The identified loci, once validated, then could be used for the forage quality traits improvement in pearl millet through marker-assisted selection.

However, the physical mechanism that allows RFMS and its optimal ridge/furrow ratio to drive the efficient utilization of water in fields are unclear. Thus, we conducted a field research for two years with spring maize based on a long-term field experiment in a semiarid region of Northwestern China to quantify evaporation and transpiration, and their relationship with maize growth, yield and water use efficiency (WUE) under RFMS. Three planting patterns of ridge/furrow ratio were tested: (1) RF40, RFMS with 60 cm wide ridges and 40 cm wide furrows; (2) RF60, RFMS with 60 cm wide ridges and 60 cm wide furrows; (3) FP, traditional flat planting (control). Stable oxygen isotope (18O) analysis was used to partition the evapotranspiration (ET) into evaporation (E) and transpiration (T). The results showed that RFMS significantly increased the soil water content (SWC) in the early and late growing season, but not in the middle period (60-120 days after sowing, DAS) when dry matter accumulated rapidly and the highest transpiration occurred. RFMS significantly decreased the nonproductive evaporation, thereby increased the physiologically significant maize transpiration by 25.0-35.7% during the whole growing season. Therefore, the transpiration fraction of ET (T/ET) was 73% and 70% under RF40 and RF60 during the whole growing season, which were significantly higher than FP. Compared to FP, the maize yield and WUE increased significantly by 55.1% and 52.2% under RF40 and by 49.5% and 47.6% under RF60. We found RFMS drives optimization of ET fractions by increased transpiration but decreased evaporation and then improved WUE of maize, higher ridge/furrow ratio (RF40) create uneven line space and higher mulching area in the field, thus drives optimization of ET components and increased yield and WUE the most. Clarification of this physical mechanism improves our understanding of the optimization of maize production under RFMS, thereby helping to optimize the ridge/furrow ratio in semiarid regions.																			0378-4290	1872-6852				OCT 15	2023	302								109040	10.1016/j.fcr.2023.109040	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2023.109040		JUL 2023											WOS:001040083500001

The roles of biocrusts in numerous soil processes have been predominantly recognized in many dryland regions worldwide. However, little is known about their effects on soil detachment process by overland flow, especially in humid climates. This study quantified the effects of moss-dominated biocrusts on soil detachment capacity (D-c) and soil erosion resistance to flowing water in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area which holds a subtropical humid climate. Potential factors driving soil detachment variation and their influencing mechanism were analyzed and elucidated. We designed five levels of coverage treatments (1%-20%, 20%-40%, 40%-60%, 60%-80%, and 80%-100%) and a nearby bare land as control in a moss-dominated site. Undisturbed soil samples were taken and subjected to water flow scouring in a hydraulic flume under six shear stresses ranging from 4.89 to 17.99 Pa. The results indicated that meanD(c)of moss-covered soil varied from 0.008 to 0.081 kg m(-2)s(-1), which was 1.9 to 21.0 times lower than that of bare soil (0.160 kg m(-2)s(-1)). Rill erodibility (K-r) of moss-covered soil ranged from 0.0095 to 0.0009 s m(-1), which was 2 to 20 times lower than that of bare soil (0.0187 s m(-1)). Both relative soil detachment rate andK(r)showed an exponential decay with increasing moss coverage, whereas the critical shear stress (tau(c)) for different moss coverage levels did not differ significantly. Moss coverage, soil cohesion, and sand content were key factors affectingD(c), while moss coverage and soil bulk density were key factors affectingK(r). A power function of flow shear stress, soil cohesion, and moss coverage fitted well to estimateD(c)(NSE=0.947). Our findings implied that biocrusts prevented soil detachment directly by their physical cover and indirectly by soil properties modification. Biocrusts could be rehabilitated as a promising soil conservation measure during ecological recovery to enhance soil erosion resistance in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area.

The increase in temperature and changes in rainfall pattern may negatively affect their extent and condition, and thus the process of carbon accumulation in wetlands. The introduction of the Sentinel series (S1 and S2) and WorldView space-borne sensors (WV3) have enabled monitoring of herbaceous above ground biomass (AGB) in small and narrow wetlands in semi-arid areas. The objective of this study was to assess (i) the capabilities of the high to moderate resolution sensors such as WV3, S1A and S2A in estimating herbaceous AGB of vegetated wetlands using SAR backscatter, optical reflectance bands, vegetation spectral indices (including Leaf Area Index or LAI measurements) and band ratio datasets and (ii) whether significant differences exists between the AGB ranges of wetland and surrounding dryland vegetation. A bootstrapped Random Forest modelling approach, with variable importance selection, was utilised which incorporated ground collected grass AGB for model calibration and validation. WorldView-3 (WV3) yielded the highest AGB prediction accuracies (R-2 = 0.63 and RMSE = 169.28 g/m(2)) regardless of the incorporation of bands only, indices only or the combination of bands and indices. In general, the optical sensors yielded higher modelling accuracies (improvement in R-2 of 0.04-0.07 and RMSE of 11.48-17.28 g/m(2)) than the single Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor but this was marginal depending on the scenario. Incorporating Sentinel 1A (S1) dual polarisation channels and Sentinel 2A (S2) reflectance bands, in particular, yielded higher accuracies (improvement in R-2 of 0.03-0.04 and RMSE of 5.4-16.88 g/m(2)) than the use of individual sensors alone and was also equivalent to the performance of the high resolution WV3 sensor results. Wetlands had significantly higher AGB compared to the surrounding terrestrial grassland (with a mean of about 80 g/m(2) more). Monitoring herbaceous AGB at the scale of the wetland extent in semi-arid to arid grasslands enables improved understanding of their carbon sequestration potential, the contributions to global carbon accounting policies and also serving as a proxy for functional intactness.

Galasso & Banfi population in Kenya	ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE												Key messageHigh genetic diversity and significant population structure ofVachellia tortilispopulation in Kenya has been determined using nuclear microsatellite markers. Despite wide distribution and long-distance gene dispersal of the species, geographic barriers affect its gene flow patterns. The Gregorian Rift Valley that cuts across the country is suggested to have differentiated the populations into eastern and western clusters.ContextVachellia tortilis is an important dryland tree species valued for fuelwood and fodder production; however, no strategy has been put in place for sustainable management of the species genetic resources. Furthermore, there is inadequate information on the species population genetics to aid the development of such strategies.AimsWe evaluated the amount and structure of neutral genetic diversity of V. tortilis population in Kenya and provided recommendations necessary for improvement and conservation of the species genetic resources. We hypothesized that the current genetic diversity of V. tortilis is high because of its demographic history and that no population structuring was expected to occur due to the presumed long-distance and effective gene flow patterns within the species.MethodsLeaf tissues were collected from 15 putative natural populations of V. tortilis covering the whole distribution range in Kenya. DNA was isolated from the leaf tissues and analyzed using microsatellite markers. In total, 450 trees were genotyped using ten polymorphic nuclear microsatellite loci, and genetic diversity and population structure parameters were determined.ResultsWe found high levels of genetic diversity within the populations with a mean gene diversity at 0.85. However, significant population differentiation was evident (F-ST = 0.026, P = 0.007; R-ST = 0.032, P = 0.004) despite a large number of migrants per generation (N-m = 5.3). Population structure detected suggests the presence of two clusters, although many individuals showed mixed ancestry. The groups reflect the influence of geographic patterns and historical population gene flow.ConclusionThere exists high genetic diversity in V. tortilis in Kenya with significant population structuring into two clusters. We recommend the consideration of the two distinct groups in the development of the species improvement, breeding, and conservation programs. Such programs should ensure maintenance of the majority of the extant genetic diversity.

Here, we collected 251 soil samples from adjacent pairs of maize and rice fields at a continental scale in eastern China. We revealed the major ecological roles of the core microbiota in maintaining complex connections between bacterial taxa and their associations with belowground multinutrient cycling. By identifying the habitat preferences of the core microbiota, we built a continental atlas for mapping the spatial distributions of bacteria in agro-soils, which helps forecast the responses of agricultural ecosystems to anthropogenic disturbance. The multinutrient cycling index for maize and rice soils was related to bacterial alpha-diversity and beta-diversity, respectively. Rice soils exhibited higher bacterial diversity and closer bacterial cooccurrence relationships than maize soils. In contrast to the macro- or microecological latitudinal richness patterns in natural terrestrial ecosystems, the bacteria in maize soils showed higher richness at high latitudes; however, this trend was not observed in rice soils. This study provides a new perspective on the distinct bacterial biogeographic patterns to predict the ecological roles of the core microbiota in agro-soils and thus helps manage soil bacterial communities for better provisioning of key ecosystem services. IMPORTANCE Disentangling the roles of the core microbiota in community maintaining and soil nutrient cycling is an important yet poorly understood topic in microbial ecology. This study presents an exploratory effort to gain predictive understanding of the spatial atlas and ecological roles of the core microbiota. A systematic, continental-scale survey was conducted using agro-soils in adjacent pairs of maize (dryland) and rice (wetland) fields across eastern China. The results indicate that the core microbiota play major ecological roles in maintaining complex connections between bacterial taxa and are associated with belowground multinutrient cycling. A continental atlas was built for mapping the bacterial spatial distributions in agro-soils through identifying their habitat preferences. This study represents a significant advance in forecasting the responses of agricultural ecosystems to anthropogenic disturbance and thus helps manage soil bacterial communities for better provisioning of key ecosystem services-the ultimate goal of microbial ecology.

Can grazing by elk and bison stimulate herbaceous plant productivity in semiarid ecosystems?	ECOSPHERE												Plant communities in rangeland ecosystems vary widely in the degree to which they can compensate for losses to herbivores. Ecosystem-level factors have been proposed to affect this compensatory capacity, including timing and intensity of grazing, and availability of soil moisture and nutrients. Arid ecosystems are particularly challenging to predict because of their high degree of temporal variability in moisture inputs. We used a replicated herbivore exclusion experiment to evaluate herbaceous plant responses to grazing by large ungulates to test current theory and identify constraints on plant compensation in a dryland ecosystem. We measured nitrogen (N) yield and herbaceous production in three plant communities: meadows, willow-associated herbaceous communities, and riparian communities. We implemented grazing exclusion treatments from 2005 to 2008 in areas with elk and bison and areas with only elk. Grazing by large ungulates increased herbaceous production and N yield in herbaceous riparian communities. In willow communities, herbaceous plants displayed equal compensation in response to grazing in total aboveground production and N yield. Our results support the idea that plant compensation in this semiarid system is contingent on soil moisture availability, wherein the most productive sites (that received substantial moisture inputs from subsurface flow) exhibited overcompensation. Although the herbaceous riparian communities we studied are isolated patches of productive grassland in an otherwise shrub-dominated and minimally productive semiarid landscape, grazing by a combination of bison and elk removed only 44%-53% of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) during the growing season, and 25%-38% of production over winter. Consumption by ungulates was a positive linear function of herbaceous production, similar to reported patterns from other temperate and tropical grazing ecosystems. The slope of this relationship was affected by the analytical method used to calculate ANPP and consumption rates, but, regardless of the method, was lower or similar to reported slopes for other intensively grazed systems (Yellowstone, Serengeti, Laikipia) that have sustained high ungulate densities for decades to centuries. Given that the vegetation communities exhibited equal or overcompensation in terms of total herbaceous ANPP in both years, elk and bison population levels during our study period did not appear to occur at densities leading to degradation of herbaceous communities.																			2150-8925					APR	2022	13	4							e4025	10.1002/ecs2.4025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4025													WOS:000779476600001
J	He, C; Wang, WQ; Hou, JL				He, Chao; Wang, Wenquan; Hou, Junling			Plant Growth and Soil Microbial Impacts of Enhancing Licorice With Inoculating Dark Septate Endophytes Under Drought Stress	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												This study mainly aimed to investigate the effects of dark septate endophytes (DSE) (Acrocalymma vagum, Paraboeremia putaminum, and Fusarium acuminatum) on the growth and microbial community composition in the rhizosphere soil of a medicinal plant, licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis), grown in the non-sterile soil under drought stress. The results showed that three DSE strains could effectively colonize the plant roots and form a strain-dependent symbiosis with licorice. Although drought stress declined the growth of licorice plants, these decreases were partly recovered by DSE inoculation. Specifically, the inoculation of A. vagum and P. putaminum significantly increased the biomass and glycyrrhizin content, whereas A. vagum and F. acuminatum increased glycyrrhizic acid content of host plants under drought stress. However, the inoculation of F. acuminatum showed significant negative effects on the shoot, root, and total biomass of licorice plants. In addition, the effects of DSE inoculation on the morphological, photosynthetic, and antioxidant parameters of licorice plants, and mineral nutrient and microbial community composition in the rhizosphere soil were dependent on the DSE species as well as water regime. Interestingly, DSE inoculation significantly increased AM fungi content under drought stress. In addition, DSE associated with water had a significant positive influence on soil organic matter, available phosphorus (P), AM fungi, leaf number, soluble protein, SOD activity, total root length, root branch, and glycyrrhizic acid content. Based on the results of variance partitioning analysis, 17.0, 34.0, 14.9, 40.1, 28.2, and 18.0% variations in shoot morphology, root morphology, plant biomass, active ingredient, photosynthetic parameters, and antioxidant parameters, respectively, were attributable to the presence of certain soil microorganisms. These findings suggest the possibility that DSE inoculation improved the root development and nutrient absorption of host plants, altered the soil microbiota, and might also contribute to plant growth and survival under drought conditions. As A. vagum exhibited positive effects on the plant biomass, morphological and physiological parameters, and active ingredient content in licorice plants under drought stress, it was considered to be the best fungus for licorice cultivation. These results contribute to the understanding of the ecological function of DSE fungi in dryland agriculture.																				1664-302X				OCT 9	2019	10								2277	10.3389/fmicb.2019.02277	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.02277								31649632					WOS:000491337700001
J	Stavi, I; Rachmilevitch, S; Yizhaq, H				Stavi, Ilan; Rachmilevitch, Shimno; Yizhaq, Hezi			Geodiversity effects on soil quality and geo-ecosystem functioning in drylands	CATENA												Geodiversity is defined as the natural variability of geologic, geomorphic, and soil features. It has been acknowledged to positively affect biodiversity and species richness. A long-term drought occurring in the semi-arid northern Negev of Israel has led to the mass mortality of shrubs, with the particularly adverse impact on the predominant Noaea mucronata species. Recent observations in these shrublands have suggested that this mass mortality is not uniformly distributed over the landscape, but is confined to hillslopes characterized by lowgeodiversity. This type of hillslope is defined by a deep (> 1 m) soil layer, lacking rock fragments in its profile and on its surface. Also, the herbaceous vegetation cover of these hillslopes is very high ( > 90%), but shrubby vegetation cover is very low ( < 10%) and for the most part, non-vital. At the same time, shrubby vegetation in high-geodiversity hillslopes - defined by a shallow (similar to 10 cm) soil layer, and high rock fragment content ( > 30% volume) and cover ( > 20%) - is rather dense ( > 25%) and vital, but their herbaceous vegetation cover is quite sparse ( < 30%). Soil was sampled from the 0-10 cm depth in two micro-habitats - shrubby patches and intershrub spaces - on both the homogeneous and heterogeneous hillslopes. Overall, soil quality was found to be considerably higher in the heterogeneous hillslopes compared to the homogeneous hillslopes. This included the contents of hygroscopic moisture, total organic carbon, particulate organic carbon, and carbon lability, whose means were 22%, 36%, 27%, and 38%, respectively, greater in the heterogeneous hillslopes. Further, mean clay dispersion index was 18% lower in the heterogeneous hillslopes. At the same time, mean soil electrical conductivity was 13% greater in the heterogeneous hillslopes. Yet, this could be attributed to the greater clay content in the former type (19.1%) than that in the latter type (12.7%) of hillslope, with the assumingly higher salt-adsorption from the soil solution. Overall, the results show that the effect of micro-habitat on the soil properties was relatively moderate, and therefore, suggest that the impact of geodiversity might override that of vegetation patchiness. The results highlight the importance of assessing patch-scale and/or hillslope-scale geodiversity in future studies of dryland ecosystems around the world.

Shifting agriculture and a depleting aquifer: implications of row-crop farming on mule deer population performance	ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE												Context. Conversion of native vegetation to cropland is one of the most widespread anthropogenic landscape alterations, particularly in the Great Plains region of the United States. Mule deer occur throughout the Great Plains; however, it is the south-eastern edge of their geographical distribution, and few populations coincide with dense cropland. The rapidly depleting Ogallala Aquifer supplies irrigation to row-crops throughout the region, which will likely shift towards dryland agricultural practices in the near future. Aims. We sought to understand how cropland use influences morphology, body condition indices, reproductive output, and survival of free-ranging mule deer. Methods. We accumulated a multi-year, longitudinal dataset of movement and morphology for 146 mule deer in the Texas Panhandle. We linked seasonal cropland use with observed morphology, body condition metrics, and reproductive output via linear mixed-effect modelling and assessed the influence of cropland on annual survival by using Cox proportional hazard models. Key results. Mule deer that did not use cropland at any time during the year exhibited morphological and nutritional indices similar to those that did; except body-fat percentage being greater for mature (=4-year-old) males that used cropland. Further, cropland use did not predict survival probability. Analyses of cropland use during seasons defined by life-stage showed context-dependent nutritional benefits. Use of cropland during winter following reproduction demonstrated an increase in young (=3-year-old) male antler size and body mass and summer crop use increased body condition for all males. Female mule deer that utilised cropland before pregnancy had increased probability of successful reproduction, demonstrating a potential capital investment strategy in reproduction. Conclusions. Cropland does not limit morphology or survival of mule deer; however, additive use of row-crops can provide a nutritional buffer and enhanced reproductive output for individuals that choose to utilise it. Implications. Our study demonstrates important population-level interactions with the environment for a species near the extent of their geographical distribution. Conversion of row-crop farming from aquifer depletion or climate shifts may not diminish mule deer populations, but these changes may alter specific habitat-nutritional health relationships that can influence population performance and future conservation efforts.																			1836-0939	1836-5787				2023 APR 11	2023					SI					10.1071/AN22408	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN22408		APR 2023											WOS:000968947100001

Meanwhile, the software for image identification, extraction and calculation were investigated, and then a raindrop measurement system combined with a charge coupled device sensor was developed. The repeatability and accuracy of steel ball estimation were checked in diameter and fall velocity and yielded low standard deviations and small relative errors. The results demonstrate that the system provides a reliable detection of raindrop size and fall velocity. Additionally, the designed system was operated for in situ measurement of natural rain. Raindrop diameter and fall velocity were, on average, 1.02 mm and 3.45 m s(-1), respectively, and small-sized particles were the predominant contributor to the natural rainfall. Notably, raindrop fall velocities were slightly higher than the corresponding terminal velocities calculated by classical models under the standard sea-level conditions. In order to identify completely the features and variations of raindrops, it is essential to implement long-term measurements and take into account the driving factors such as air motions, raindrop breakup or coalescence. This work will be pursued soon in coming future.																			0169-8095	1873-2895				SEP 15	2020	242								104963	10.1016/j.atmosres.2020.104963	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2020.104963													WOS:000535422200004

Reducing N<sub>2</sub>O emissions with enhanced efficiency nitrogen fertilizers (EENFs) in a high-yielding spring maize system	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Enhanced efficiency nitrogen fertilizers (EENFs), including nitrification inhibitors (NIs) and slow-release fertilizer (SRF), are considered promising approaches for mitigating nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions while improving crop yield. This study investigated the combined application of EENFs with improved water and fertilizer management in an intensively irrigated spring maize rotation over five years in North-western China. High-frequency measurements of N2O fluxes were made throughout each year (both during crop growth and the fallow season) in five treatments: no N fertilizer as a control (CK), conventional N fertilization and irrigation (Con), optimum N fertilization and irrigation (Opt, 33% reduction in N fertilizer and 25% reduction of irrigation water), optimum N fertilization and irrigation with nitrification inhibitor (Opt + NI), and optimum N fertilization and irrigation with slow-release fertilizer (Opt-SRF). Annual mean cumulative N2O emissions reached 0.31 +/- 0.07, 3.66 +/- 0.19, 1.87 +/- 0.16, 1.23 +/- 0.13, and 1.61 +/- 0.16 kg N2O-N ha(-1) for CK, Con, Opt, Opt thorn NI, and Opt-SRF, respectively, with annual mean nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of 36, 54, 61 and 59% for Con, Opt, Opt thorn NI, and Opt-SRF, respectively. The Opt, Opt thorn NI and Opt-SRF treatments significantly reduced cumulative N2O emissions by 49%, 66%, and 56% (P < 0.05), respectively, and increased NUE by 51%, 70%, and 66% (P < 0.05), respectively, relative to Con. However, mean above-ground N uptake (288-309 kg N ha(-1)) and mean grain yields (12.7-12.8 Mg ha(-1)) did not differ significantly between the Con, Opt, Opt thorn NI, and Opt-SRF treatments during the five-year study. High N2O emissions mainly occurred within a few days of fertilization with irrigation, which could have been produced by microbially-mediated nitrifier or nitrifier denitrification processes. The fallow seasons had significantly lower cumulative N2O emissions, which were mainly attributed to the low temperature, low N inputs of crop residues, and low soil moisture conditions. Our study clearly indicated that the combined application of EENFs with optimum N fertilization and irrigation management can reduce environmental impacts while maintaining high crop yields in dryland regions such as Northwest China.

Although altered precipitation affects above- and belowground C:N:P stoichiometry, considerable uncertainties remain regarding plant-microbial nutrient allocation strategies under increased (IPPT) and decreased (DPPT) precipitation. We meta-analyzed 827 observations from 235 field studies to investigate the effects of IPPT and DPPT on the C:N:P stoichiometry of plants, soils, and microorganisms. DPPT reduced leaf C:N ratio, but increased the leaf and root N:P ratios reflecting stronger decrease of P compared with N mobility in soil under drought. IPPT increased microbial biomass C (+13%), N (+15%), P (26%), and the C:N ratio, whereas DPPT decreased microbial biomass N (-12%) and the N:P ratio. The C:N and N:P ratios of plant leaves were more sensitive to medium DPPT than to IPPT because drought increased plant N content, particularly in humid areas. The responses of plant and soil C:N:P stoichiometry to altered precipitation did not fit the double asymmetry model with a positive asymmetry under IPPT and a negative asymmetry under extreme DPPT. Soil microorganisms were more sensitive to IPPT than to DPPT, but they were more sensitive to extreme DPPT than extreme IPPT, consistent with the double asymmetry model. Soil microorganisms maintained stoichiometric homeostasis, whereas N:P ratios of plants follow that of the soils under altered precipitation. In conclusion, specific N allocation strategies of plants and microbial communities as well as N and P availability in soil critically mediate C:N:P stoichiometry by altered precipitation that need to be considered by prediction of ecosystem functions and C cycling under future climate change scenarios. Based on peer-reviewed studies, we meta-analyzed 827 pairwise observations from 235 field studies to assess terrestrial C:N:P stoichiometry. Plants were more sensitive to decreased precipitation than to increased precipitation, particularly in humid areas. However, soil microbial communities were more sensitive to increased precipitation than to decreased precipitation, which were aligned with the double asymmetry model. Soil microorganisms maintained stoichiometric homeostasis, whereas plants tended to follow that of the soils under altered precipitation. Our results highlighted that specific N allocation strategies of plants and microbial communities would mediate ecosystem carbon-climate feedback.image					; Penuelas, Josep/D-9704-2011; Kuzyakov, Yakov/D-1605-2010	zhouping, shangguan/0000-0002-5815-6310; Wu, Jianzhao/0000-0003-3124-1109; Penuelas, Josep/0000-0002-7215-0150; Kuzyakov, Yakov/0000-0002-9863-8461; Li, Jiwei/0000-0003-3912-4564; Peng, Changhui/0000-0003-2037-8097													1354-1013	1365-2486				2023 OCT 3	2023										10.1111/gcb.16959	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.16959		OCT 2023						37787740					WOS:001073886000001

The Complexity of the Seasonality of Nutritional Status: Two Annul Peaks in Child Wasting in Eastern Chad	FOOD AND NUTRITION BULLETIN												Background: Understanding seasonal patterns in nutritional status is critical for achieving and tracking global nutrition goals. However, the majority of nutrition seasonality research design draws on 2 or 3 within-year time points based on existing assumptions of seasonality, missing a more nuanced pattern.Objective: We aimed to identify the intra-year variability of childhood wasting, severe wasting, and weight-for-height z-scores (WHZ) in a dryland single wet-season context and illustrate an analytical approach for improving analysis of the seasonality of nutritional status.Methods: To quantify the intra-year variability in nutritional status, we use data from a 23-month panel study (May 2018 to March 2020) following 231 children (6-59 months of age) in eastern Chad. We apply a mixed-effects harmonic regression with child- and village-level fixed effects on the odds of being wasted, severely wasted, and on WHZ, testing for multiple and nonsymmetrical seasonal peaks, adjusted for child sex and age. We triangulate our findings using climate data on temperature, vegetation, and precipitation.Results: We identify 2 annual peaks of wasting and severe wasting. Wasting peaks at 14.7% (confidence interval [CI], 11.8-18.2) at the end of the dry season, while the smaller peak corresponds to the start of the harvest period at 13.4% (CI, 10.7-16.6). The odds of being wasted decline during the rainy season to 11.8% (CI, 9.4-14.7), with the lowest prevalence of 8.8% (CI, 6.9-11.1) occurring during the start of the dry season. In addition, a 1 degrees C monthly increase in temperature is significantly associated with a 5% (CI, 1.4-8.7) and 12% (CI, 3.0-20.3) increase in the odds that a child is wasted and severely wasted, respectively.Conclusions: Intra-year variability of child wasting is far more complex and nuanced than identified by the literature, with 2 peaks, as opposed to 1, likely corresponding to different seasonal drivers, such as food insecurity, disease, water contamination, and care practices at different times of year. Better seasonality analysis can go a long way in improving the timing and content of programming with the goal of reducing child wasting.																			0379-5721	1564-8265				DEC	2023	44	2_SUPPL		2_	SI		S109	S118		10.1177/03795721231181715	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03795721231181715								37850930					WOS:001100350200011

Limited range shifting in biocrusts despite climate warming: A 25-year resurvey	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The ranges of many species globally have already shifted to maintain climatic equilibrium in the face of climate change. Biocrusts-soil surface dwelling communities of lichens, bryophytes and microbes-play important functional roles in many ecosystems, particularly in drylands. Compared to better studied animal and plant taxa, dryland biocrusts have different establishment requirements and have never been assessed for historical range shifts. Here, we revisited the sites (N = 204) of a 25-year-old biocrust survey across a large area (400,000 km(2)) of drylands in south-eastern Australia. We used quadratic models to quantify changes in the climate niches of 15 lichen, eight moss and five liverwort taxa, as well as biocrust cover and richness. Our models showed that the observed climatic niches of most taxa have become hotter and drier in the past quarter century, yet the responses of the vast majority of taxa are consistent with remaining in the same geographic space. A similar pattern was observed at the community level, where the peak of biocrust cover and richness now occurs in a hotter, drier environment. Notable exceptions were the liverwort Riccia lamellosa and lichens in the genera Cladonia and Xanthoparmelia, which showed signs of contraction at their arid range edges. Unlike more mobile taxa, most biocrust species have yet to shift geographically and may already be lagging behind the pace of climate change. One explanation for the mortality lag is that long-term climate variability in the system is extensive, which may have selected for the ability to withstand multi-year warm periods as long as there is an eventual return to milder conditions. However, no forecasts of future climate include a return to milder conditions, suggesting there will be an eventual loss of ecosystem multifunctionality at the contracting front. Expansion lags are most likely due to delays in the mortality of competing vascular plants Synthesis: Our study provides a valuable contribution to the knowledge of range shifts in understudied taxa and highlights a future need to promote the expansion of biocrusts to maintain the provision of ecosystem functions and services across their range.

Consequently, it is important to understand how soil colloids and their functions are influenced by land cover and anthropogenic disturbances. In grasslands, savannas, and other dryland ecosystems across the globe, woody plants are encroaching due to livestock grazing, fire suppression, elevated CO2 concentrations, and climate change. These major land cover changes could influence soil colloidal properties, with implications for soil C, N, and P cycles. We assessed how woody encroachment, livestock grazing, and fire interact to influence soil colloidal properties in a juniper-oak savanna. Surface soils (0-10 cm) from the southern Great Plains (Texas, USA) were collected from long-term treatments differing in grazing intensity (none, moderate, and heavy) and fire history. Within each treatment, soil samples were taken under grass, juniper, and oak canopies. Water dispersible soil colloids (WDC, d < 500 nm) were isolated and analyzed by asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation and their P species by liquid-state 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P NMR). Soil beneath oak and juniper canopies had smaller WDC and elevated colloidal organic carbon (OC) and P concentrations, especially in nanocolloid (<30 nm) and fine colloid (30-160 nm) size fractions. Woody encroachment enriched Ca, Fe, Al, Si and Mg in WDC in the ungrazed control, but not in any of the other grazed or burned areas. Colloidal soil P mainly occurred as orthophosphate and orthophosphate diesters, and was present as OC-Ca-P complexes in fine and medium colloid fractions (30-500 nm), while P in the nanocolloid fraction (<30 nm) was in direct association with Ca. Moderate grazing did not affect the retention of colloidal P, while heavy grazing potentially increased the loss risk of colloidal P. Fire accelerated soil P loss from colloid fractions only in woody areas. Our findings highlight that woody encroachment strengthens the retention of OC and P by soil colloids, consequently increasing overall C and P pools in savanna soils.

Assessment of crop traits retrieved from airborne hyperspectral and thermal remote sensing imagery to predict wheat grain protein content	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Wheat (Triticum spp.) is among the world's most widely grown crops and receives large quantities of nitrogen (N) fertiliser. Grain protein content (GPC) is influenced by genetic, agronomic and weather conditions affecting crops' physiological status and stress levels; accurate GPC prediction has potential to reduce N losses and improve profit. Success in GPC estimation from remotely sensed plant traits has been limited. For progress to be made, it is necessary to robustly identify imaging spectroscopy-based physiological traits most closely associated with GPC in both experimental and commercial contexts. We present results from piloted hyperspectral flights and ground campaigns at two dryland field experiments with divergent water supply and wide-ranging N treatments, and from two years' flights over 17 commercial fields planted to either bread (T. aestivum) or durum (T. durum) wheat, in the southern Australian wheat belt. Imagery was acquired with airborne hyperspectral and thermal sensors, with spatial resolutions of approx. 0.3 m and 0.5 m for experimental plots and 1 m/1.7 m in commercial fields. Leaf clip measurements, leaf and grain samples were collected and, in commercial fields, similar to 40,000 records obtained from harvester-mounted protein monitors. Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), reflectance indices and PRO4SAIL radiative transfer model inverted parameters were retrieved for each plot and GPC record location. The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) related to xanthophyll pigments was consistently associated with GPC at both leaf and canopy scale in the plots and transect. In the commercial crops, a gradient boosted machine learning algorithm (GBM) ranked CWSI as the strongest indicator of GPC under severe water stress, while SIF, PRI and inverted biochemical constituents an-thocyanins and carotenoids were consistently important under more benign conditions. Structural parameters inverted from the hyperspectral reflectance imagery were not prominent except under severe drought. We attained statistically significant results estimating GPC in unseen samples, with best relationships between predicted and observed GPC of r(2) = 0.80 in a model built with thermal and physiological traits obtained from the hyperspectral and thermal imagery.					; Zarco-Tejada, Pablo J./A-6874-2012	Poblete, Tomas/0000-0003-1944-6494; Hunt, James/0000-0003-2884-5622; Zarco-Tejada, Pablo J./0000-0003-1433-6165; Longmire, Andrew/0000-0002-4212-7371													0924-2716	1872-8235				NOV	2022	193						284	298		10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2022.09.015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2022.09.015		OCT 2022											WOS:000876727700002
J	Sagi, N; Zaguri, M; Hawlena, D				Sagi, Nevo; Zaguri, Moshe; Hawlena, Dror			Soil CO<sub>2</sub> influx in drylands: A conceptual framework and empirical examination	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Soil CO2 flux is dominated in most ecosystems by respiration of soil organisms and roots, and is therefore expected to be positive (i.e., efflux) during dark hours. Growing evidence from various ecosystems contradicts this expectation, showing nocturnal soil CO2 influx. Little is known about this puzzling phenomenon and the underlying mechanisms governing it. We attempted to bridge this knowledge gap by proposing the "dryland carbon influx" (DCI) framework. Based on Henry's law, decreases in soil temperature stimulate CO2 dissolution in soil solutions, creating a CO2 concentration gradient between soil air and the atmosphere. This may lead to CO2 diffusion from the atmosphere into the soil. This influx is expected to be stronger at lower temperatures, high soil to atmosphere temperature gradients, and in CaCO3 rich alkaline soils that characterize drylands. The soil abiotic influx is expected to govern the overall CO2 flux when dry conditions and low soil organic matter limit organismal respiration. We examined the underlying conditions predicted by the DCI framework using a literature review and soil CO2 flux measurements from the Negev Desert. We found 24 studies that reported dark soil CO2 influx, almost exclusively from drylands. CO2 influx was recorded mainly in alkaline soils, was positively correlated with pH levels, and was associated predominantly with low soil temperature, decreasing soil temperature or a positive soil to air thermal gradient. CO2 influx was found not only in dry soils but also in poor organic content wet soils. In the Negev Desert, CO2 influx occurred only when (a) soil temperature was higher than air temperature and was decreasing, and (b) soil moisture was 7.76% or lower. Only above this threshold, a positive association between CO2 efflux and microbial biomass was found. Our results largely support the DCI framework, suggesting that soil CO2 influx is prevalent across drylands worldwide, facilitated by the edaphic and climatic conditions that induce abiotic CO2 exchange and restrain biotic respiration. Considering the abiotic contribution to soil CO2 flux, and determining the conditions that regulate it may substantially improve our carbon budget calculations, and estimations of soil biotic respiration.

J	Furukawa, M; Hara, Y; Jodai, Y				Furukawa, Masaru; Hara, Yutaka; Jodai, Yoshifumi			Analytical Model for Phase Synchronization of a Pair of Vertical-Axis Wind Turbines	ENERGIES												The phase-synchronized rotation of a pair of closely spaced vertical-axis wind turbines has been found in wind tunnel experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. During phase synchronization, the two wind turbine rotors rotate inversely at the same mean angular velocity. The blades of the two rotors pass through the gap between the turbines almost simultaneously, while the angular velocities oscillate with a small amplitude. A pressure drop in the gap region, explained by Bernoulli's law, has been proposed to generate the interaction torque required for phase synchronization. In this study, an analytical model of the interaction torques was developed. In our simulations using the model, (i) phase synchronization occurred, (ii) the angular velocities of the rotors oscillated during the phase synchronization, and (iii) the oscillation period became shorter and the amplitude became larger as the interaction became stronger. These observations agree qualitatively with the experiments and CFD simulations. Phase synchronization was found to occur even for a pair of rotors with slightly different torque characteristics. Our simulation also shows that the induced flow velocities influence the dependence of the angular velocities during phase synchronization on the rotation directions of the rotors and the distance between the rotors.					; Hara, Yutaka/D-3572-2019	Furukawa, Masaru/0000-0002-8256-9596; Jodai, Yoshifumi/0000-0002-3824-2887; Hara, Yutaka/0000-0002-3037-2468														1996-1073				JUN	2022	15	11							4130	10.3390/en15114130	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15114130													WOS:000808759700001

Biofertilizer can alleviate their impact and increase agricultural sustainability. However, the effects of living green microalgae on crop growth under saline-alkali stress are unclear. In this study, the unicellular green microalga Chlorella pyrenoidosa, used as a seed primer and a biofertilizer, was applied to investigate its effects on the growth characteristic of Chenopodium quinoa under artificial saline-alkali conditions (1:1 ratio of NaCl and NaHCO3) and natural saline-alkali soils. The seed primer experiment revealed that saline-alkali stresses inhibited seed germination and decreased seedling vigor index, root length and branch number, shoot length, and fresh weight of C. quinoa. Compared to the control, 25% and 50% doses of C. pyrenoidosa, however, increased the germination of C. quinoa seeds at the stresses of 100 mM and 200 mM saline-alkali concentrations by 29.3% and 12.6%, respectively. A 75% dose of algal cell enhanced the seedling characteristics and alleviated the inhibiting effects of saline-alkali stress on root and shoot length, seedling vigor index, and fresh weight of C. quinoa at 100 mM stress. In the biofertilizer experiment, the growth of C. quinoa was inhibited under saline-alkali soils; algal treatments improved the root length and branch number, shoot length, leaf size, and fresh weight of C. quinoa as well as soil available N, P, and K contents. A comprehensive analysis showed that 100% dose of algae exhibited a lower positive efficiency than 75% dose in the seed experiment. The present study demonstrated that living algal biofertilizer exerted the promoting effects on the germination and plant growth of crops under saline-alkali conditions.

Time-frequency analysis and simulation of the watershed suspended sediment concentration based on the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods: A case study in the Loess Plateau of China	CATENA												Suspended sediment concentration (SSC) time series are highly nonlinear and nonstationary due to numerous influencing factors that can be characterized by specific time scales, thereby increasing the difficulty of performing SSC simulations. Analyzing the spectral and temporal information of the SSC and its contributing factors can improve the resulting simulation efforts. In this study, the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) was used to identify the time scales and change trends of the daily SSC, rainfall, runoff and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of the Kuye River in the Loess Plateau of China. Artificial neural network (ANN), multiple linear regression (MLR), hybrid ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD)-ANN and EEMD-MLR models were chosen to simulate the SSC time series. The periods of the rainfall intrinsic mode functions (IMFs, except IMF9 and 10) were generally consistent with those of the IMFs corresponding to the SSC and runoff. In comparison, the periods of the IMFs corresponding to the NDVI were longer. The minimal period was 3 days for the SSC, rainfall and runoff and 10 days for the NDVI. The minimal period displays the greatest variance contribution and plays the most important role in the SSC, rainfall and runoff changes. The annual cycle has the largest contribution to the NDVI variability. Residual components indicated that the SSC of the Kuye River decreased from 2006 to 2010, while the regional rainfall, runoff and NDVI increased. The R-2 values of the ANN and MLR models were 0.34 and 0.39, respectively. Compared with the MLR and ANN models, the R-2 values of the EEMD-ANN and EEMD-MLR models increased by 52.9% and 41.0%, respectively, indicating that the ANN model was more robust than the MLR model when simulating nonlinear SSC time series. Compared with EMD, EEMD can alleviate the mode mixing problem and significantly increase the simulation accuracy with the ANN and MLR models. Significance tests were employed to determine the strength of the physical meaning in each IMF component. Taking IMFs with significant (p < 0.05) period oscillations as input data, the EEMD-ANN model had a high R-2 of 0.64. Using IMFs having significant (p < 0.05) correlations with the SSC as input variables, the EEMD-ANN model achieved the largest R-2 of 0.66. The results of this study supply effective means for simulating and predicting soil erosion. However, it still remains a remarkable challenge to accurately simulate the SSC. Additional factors, such as topographic characteristics and land use, should be considered in future research.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				AUG	2019	179						107	118		10.1016/j.catena.2019.03.042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2019.03.042													WOS:000468716800011

However, the molecular basis of drought tolerance in S. italica is not yet understood. Previously, we comprehensively characterised the SiWRKY genes and discovered that SiWRKY89, a homologue of AtWRKY57, had a noticeably higher expression level during dry conditions. In this study, a transgenic experiment was carried out in Arabidopsis to investigate the function of SiWRKY89 in conferring drought tolerance. Phenotypic analysis showed that the root length of seedlings and the survival rates of mature transgenic Arabidopsis were greater than those of the control plants under drought conditions. Additionally, compared to the control plants, the transgenic plants had higher proline content and antioxidant activity. Furthermore, qRT-PCR investigation for abiotic stress-responsive genes revealed that SiWRKY89-overexpressing plants had higher expression levels than their control counterparts. Additionally, the yeast one-hybrid experiment demonstrated that SiWRKY89 could bind to the W-box elements of AtNCED3. By upregulating the downstream gene AtNCED3 and activating the reactive oxygen species scavenging mechanisms, SiWRKY89 overexpression improved Arabidopsis drought tolerance. Thus, we provide a molecular and biochemical basis for drought tolerance and a candidate gene for crop breeding for drought tolerance.

However, the specific effects of the interactions between increased precipitation and N deposition on C:N:P stoichiometry in soil microbial biomass remain unclear. A long-term (9 yr) manipulated experiment was conducted to investigate the responses of soil microbial biomass C:N:P stoichiometry to increased precipitation and N deposition of the Desert shrubland in Gurbantunggut, northwest China. The results demonstrated that increased precipitation elevated C, N, and C:N ratios of microbial biomass by 26.9%, 18.7%, and 6.8% relative to ambient precipitation, respectively. In comparison to ambient N deposition, N addition resulted in a 37.5% increase in soil microbial biomass N and a 6.8% increase in the N:P ratio. Particularly, the interactive effects between increased precipitation and N deposition on microbial biomass P and N:P ratio were significant. Moreover, the influences of increased precipitation and N addition on microbial biomass C:N:P stoichiometry primarily occurred through changes in dissolved organic carbon content and extracellular enzyme activities. The findings underscore the crucial role of increased precipitation as a stronger driving force for variations in microbial biomass C:N:P stoichiometry in arid ecosystems, compared to N deposition.

Grassland restoration is one of the fastest methods to increase soil C stocks, and particulate-associated C and mineral-associated C play critical roles in soil C stocks during restoration. Herein, we developed a conceptual mechanistic frame regarding the contributions made by mineral-associated organic matter to soil C during the restoration of temperate grasslands. Compared to 1-year grassland restoration, 30-year restoration increased mineral-associated organic C (MAOC) by 41% and particulate organic C (POC) by 47%. The SOC changed from microbial MAOC predominance to plant-derived POC predominance, as the POC was more sensitive to grassland restoration. The POC increased with plant biomass (mainly litter and root biomass), while the increase in MAOC was mainly caused by the combined effects of increasing microbial necromass and leaching of the base cations (Ca-bound C). Plant biomass accounted for 75% of the increase in POC, whereas bacterial and fungal necromass contributed to 58% of the variance in MAOC. POC and MAOC contributed to 54% and 46% of the increase in SOC, respectively. Consequently, the accumulation of the fast (POC) and slow (MAOC) pools of organic matter are important for the sequestration of SOC during grassland restoration. Overall, simultaneous tracing of POC and MAOC helps further understand the mechanisms and predict soil C dynamics combined with the input of plant C, microbial properties, and availability of soil nutrients during grassland restoration.

Based on the correlation between meteorological factors, different meteorological factor input combinations were established and the support vector machine method was used to estimate global solar radiation at 80 weather stations in four climatic regions of China mainland. The results showed that, the optimal combinations of input meteorological factors were different in the four different climatic zones in China mainland. Three meteorological factors of sunshine hours, extraterrestrial radiation, and air temperature had greater impacts on the solar radiation estimation. Adding the factor of precipitation could obviously improve the estimation accuracy in humid regions, but not remarkably in arid regions. Wind speed had very little influence on solar radiation estimation. The accuracies of machine learning methods were better than the Angstrom-Prescott formula and the multiple linear regression method. Among them, support vector machine and extreme learning machine were more appropriate. In some sites, the root mean square error of support vector machine method was even 20% less than that of the Angstrom-Prescott formula. In general, reasonable division of the areas and establishment of appropriate input combinations of meteorological factors according to the climatic conditions, combined with machine learning methods, can effectively improve the accuracy of solar radiation estimation.

Options for diversification and its associated drivers might be shaped by livelihood context, and it remains as a general gap in knowledge. This study aimed to reveal the driving factors behind households' decisions to diversify their crops in different livelihood contexts. This information could be useful to inform stakeholders on a set of context-fitted options for improving natural resources and rural livelihood resilience to climatic variability and risks. This study applied the Sustainable Livelihood Framework (SLF) to guide surveys and multivariate analyses that identified agricultural livelihood context types at the village level, and also evaluated both the common and type-specific drivers encouraging households to diversify their agricultural production in two rural villages in the Aral Sea region. This study objectively identified three distinct agricultural livelihood types and the main factors differentiating these types from each other. When the total sampled population was analyzed, the results indicated that the agricultural experience of the household heads, levels of education, sources of income, number of cattle and land endowments, and proximity to markets were common and significant drivers in diversifying these households' crop production. Analyzing the decisions behind diversifying crop production for each agricultural livelihood type revealed type-specific drivers of diversification. The findings suggested that considering both common and type-specific drivers of diversification would allow better understanding of household decisions and provide more insights to develop effective policies promoting climate-smart agriculture through diversification, rather than continuing to use the current "uniform blanket" approach.

Grains	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY												Selenium (Se) biofortification in wheat reduces the risk of Se deficiency in humans. Se biofortification increases the concentration of Se and anthocyanins in wheat grains. However, it is unknown whether Se biofortification can enhance flavonoids other than anthocyanins and the mechanism underlying flavonoid accumulation in wheat grains. Here, foliar application of selenite solution in wheat was conducted 10 days after flowering. Metabolite profiling and transcriptome sequencing were performed in Se-treated grains. A significant increase in the total contents of Se, anthocyanins, and flavonoids was observed in Se-treated mature grains. Twenty-seven significantly increased flavonoids were identified in Se-treated immature grains. The significant accumulation of flavones (tricin, tricin derivatives, and chrysoeriol derivatives) was detected, and six anthocyanins, dihydroquercetin (the precursor for anthocyanin biosynthesis) and catechins were also increased. Integrated analysis of metabolites and transcriptome revealed that Se application enhanced the biosynthesis of flavones, dihydroquercetin, anthocyanins, and catechins by increasing the expression levels of seven key structural genes in flavonoid biosynthesis (two TaF3Hs, two TaDFRs, one TaF3 ' 5 ' H, one TaOMT, and one TaANR). Our findings shed new light on the molecular mechanism underlying the enhancement in flavonoid accumulation by Se supplementation and pave the way for further enhancing the nutritional value of wheat grains.																			0021-8561	1520-5118				OCT 19	2022	70	41					13431	13444		10.1021/acs.jafc.2c04868	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.2c04868		OCT 2022						36198089					WOS:000868690200001

Lava			Disease incidence and severity in cowpea lines evaluated for resistance to single and multiple infections of endemic viruses in Nigeria	JOURNAL OF CROP IMPROVEMENT												Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata(L.) Walp) is susceptible to several viruses in West Africa. Cowpea viral diseases are mainly controlled through the use of resistant cultivars. Co-infection with more than one virus is frequent in the fields and the resultant synergistic effect often compromises host resistance identified by screening against individual viruses under field or controlled conditions. In this study, eight improved cowpea breeding lines, identified as resistant to single infections and a susceptible cultivar (Ife Brown), were evaluated for their reactions to single and multiple infections of three viruses endemic in West Africa; viz., bean common mosaic virus-blackeye cowpea mosaic strain (BCMV-BlCM), southern bean mosaic virus (SBMV), and cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). Cowpea seedlings were inoculated with these viruses singly or in combination. Disease incidence and severity were recorded at weekly intervals for eight weeks. Virus infection was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Systemic mosaic, vein-banding, and stunting were observed on inoculated plants. Mixed infection increased symptom severity and the highest severity was found in plants co-infected with CMV. Phenotyping against mixed-infections was more promising for estimating host resistance response in cowpea than single infections. Based on virus incidence and severity, lines IT97K-1069-6 and IT04K-405-5 were found to be resistant to SBMV, whereas IT99K-1060 and IT98K-503-1 were susceptible to the three viruses. IT-98 K-1092-1 was found to be resistant to BCMV and SBMV and tolerant to CMV under mixed inoculation scenario. Cowpea line IT-98 K-1092-1 is, thus, the best resistance source for use in virus resistance-breeding programs.

However, the combined effects of these practices on yield, WP, and the stocks of SOC and total nitrogen (TN) need to be better understood. This study investigated the long-term effects of different practices on crop yields, WP, and SOC and TN stocks in the 0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm layers based on a 12-year spring maize (Zea mays L.) field experiment on the Loess Plateau. The treatments included no mulching + NPK (CK), gravel mulching + NPK (GM), film mulching + NPK (FM), and film mulching + NPK + cow manure (FCM). In 2019 and 2020, compared with the control, both FM and FCM significantly increased crop yields, WP, N uptake efficiency (NupE) and N fertilizer productivity (NfP). Compared with CK, the FCM treatment significantly increased the SOC and TN stocks by 44.10% and 39.51%, respectively, on average, and the minimum C input that could maintain the soil C balance on the Loess Plateau was 0.67 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1). Over the 12 experimental years, compared with the initial value in 2009, the trends of SOC and TN contents in the FM treatment were downward, while those in the FCM treatment increased by 41.61% and 30.27%, respectively, but yearly input of manure led to SOC equilibrium. Compared with CK, the FCM treatment significantly decreased SOC and TN sequestration potential by 33.38% and 19.59%, respectively, on average in topsoil (0-20 cm), but it had less of an effect on SOC and TN sequestration at 20-40 and 40-60 cm soil depths. The reasons for SOC reaching equilibrium in the FCM treatment were analyzed, and periodic subsoiling was proposed to break the equilibrium state to further improve the sequestration amount of SOC and TN at 0-60 cm soil depths. In conclusion, film mulching with manure amendment was recommended as a long-term strategy to improve soil productivity and soil fertility in semiarid farmland.

The availability of extensive data (n = 1,781) from 2-yr nutrient omission trials in the most suitable agroecological zone for maize (Zea mays L.) in Nigeria (i.e., the northern Guinea savanna) provides an opportunity to assess nutrient limitations and imbalances using the concept of multi-ratio compositional nutrient diagnosis (CND). We also compared and contrasted the use of linear regression models and bootstrap forest machine learning to predict maize yield based on nutrient concentration in ear leaves. The results showed that 35% of the experimental plots had low yields due to nutrient imbalances (hereafter referred to as low yield imbalanced [LYI]). These experimental plots were dominated by control plots (without any nutrients applied), plots without N fertilization, and plots without P fertilization. Using the control plot as the ultimate indicator of nutrient imbalance, the significantly limiting nutrients in order of decreasing frequency of deficiency were N, P, S, Ca > Cu, and B. Both linear regression and bootstrap forest machine learning models fairly predicted maize grain yield based on nutrient concentration in ear leaves only in the LYI group and when examining all data with an independent validation dataset. These results suggest that nutrient management strategies, especially through the site-specific management approach, should consider S, Ca, Cu, and B in addition to the existing nutrients N, P, and K to improve nutrient balance and maize yield in the study area.

The relationship of time to runoff (RT), flow velocity (V), runoff rate (RR) and interrill erosion rate (IER) with slope gradient was investigated to derive accurate experimental model to evaluate and quantify the influence of slopes on interrill erosion processes. Materials and methods The experimental soil was collected from Ansai County of Shaanxi Province, China. The average diameter of the test soil was 0.041 mm. The experiment was conducted at slopes of 8.74%, 17.62%, 26.78%, 36.38%, 46.6%, 57.70% and 69.97% under I of 90, 120 and 150 mm h(-1), respectively, using indoor simulated rainfall. Time to runoff, flow velocity, runoff rate and interrill erosion rate were measured for each combination. Results and discussion Results showed that the time to runoff decreased as a linear function with increasing slope gradient. Slope gradient was a good predictor of time to runoff for different rainfall intensities with NSE from 0.90 to 0.97 and MSE from 0.1 to 0.25 and R-2 from 0.90 to 0.97. The flow velocity increased as a power function with increasing slope gradients. Slope gradient was a good predictor of flow velocity for different rainfall intensities with NSE from 0.91 to 0.93 and MSE from 0.01 to 0.015 and R-2 from 0.95 to 0.98. The runoff rate increased as a power function with increasing slope gradients. Slope gradient was a good predictor of runoff rate for different rainfall intensities with NSE from 0.90 to 0.95 and MSE from 0.000000024 to 0.000000044 and R-2 from 0.94 to 0.97. The interrill erosion rate increased as a power function with increasing slope gradients. Slope gradient was a good predictor of interrill erosion rate for different rainfall intensities with NSE from 0.98 to 0.99 and MSE from 0.00022 to 0.00055 and R-2 from 0.98 to 0.99. Conclusions By performing the controlled simulated rainfall experiments, this study showed that slopes strongly influenced interrill erosion processes for different rainfall intensities.					li, xinlu/HLX-5595-2023														1439-0108	1614-7480				NOV	2021	21	11					3672	3681		10.1007/s11368-021-03018-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-021-03018-6		JUL 2021											WOS:000675044500001

For many years, phenotypic evaluation and quality analysis were used to identify 66 strong drought-resistant varieties and one strong gluten variety from 323 wheat local germplasm resources. The 55 K SNP marker was used to investigate the association between major agronomic traits. Under irrigation conditions, 17 SNP loci were significantly correlated with major agronomic characteristics, 8 related candidate genes were annotated. Under drought stress and irrigation conditions, 32 SNP loci were significantly correlated with major agronomic characteristics, 24 related candidate genes were annotated. Three SNP loci were significantly associated with multiple traits, one SNP loci was stable and correlated considerably with spike length in multiple environments.154 significant association sites with drought resistance-related traits in wheat maturity were identified using whole gene association analysis of drought tolerance coefficient of yield-related characteristics, 50 functional candidate genes were annotated and six candidate genes were screened out that may participate in the drought stress response of yield-related traits at the adult stage. These findings also served as a foundation for subsequent gene cloning and molecular marker-assisted drought-resistant wheat breeding.																			0925-9864	1573-5109				APR	2023	70	4					1097	1113		10.1007/s10722-022-01488-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-022-01488-2		DEC 2022											WOS:000895435600001

Through Identification and Multi-environment Validation of Resistant Sources Against Fusarium Wilt (<i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>ciceris</i>)	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS												Fusarium wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceris) of chickpea is the major limitation to chickpea production worldwide. As the nature of the pathogen is soil borne, exploitation of host plant resistance is the most suitable and economical way to manage this disease. Present study was therefore conducted with an aim to find new, stable and durable sources of resistance of chickpea against Fusarium wilt through multi-environment and multi-year screening. During 2007/2008 crop season, 130 promising genotypes having <10% wilt incidence were selected from initial evaluation of 893 chickpea genotypes in wilt sick plot at ICRISAT, Patancheru. Of them 61 highly resistant lines were selected through further evaluation in 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 crop season. Finally, a set of 31 genotypes were selected to constitute a Chickpea Wilt Nursery (CWN) and tested at 10 locations in India for three cropping seasons (2010/2011, 2011/2012, and 2012/2013) coordinated through Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and ICRISAT collaboration. The genotype and genotype x environment interaction (GGE) indicated significant variations (p = 0.001) due to genotypexenvironment (GxE) interaction. Most of genotypes were resistant at two locations, ICRISAT (Patancheru) and Badnapur. On the contrary most of them were susceptible at Dholi and Kanpur indicating the variability in pathogen. GGE biplot analyses allowed the selection six genotypes ICCVs 98505, 07105, 07111, 07305, 08113, and 93706 with high resistance and stability across most of the locations and eight moderately resistant (<20% mean incidence) genotypes viz., ICCVs 08123, 08125, 96858, 07118, 08124, 04514, 08323, and 08117. As chickpea is grown in diverse agro-ecological zones and environments; these stable/durable sources can be used in future resistance breeding program to develop Fusarium wilt resistant cultivars.

Gluten free flour made of pulses is known to enhance the nutritional quality of wheat flour. However, its addition can compromise the rheological and sensorial attributes of the bread. We used mixture design to optimize nutritional and technological qualities of a wheat-chickpea flour blend by adding milk powder as a natural organoleptic improver. A total of thirteen flour blends were prepared by incorporating 10 to 30% chickpea flour and 10 to 20% milk powder to wheat flour. Our results showed that the optimal flour blend consisted of 60% wheat, 24% chickpea, and 16% milk powder. Farinographic parameters of the optimal dough blend remained on par with those of the control dough (100% wheat flour), thereby preserving its bread-making quality. Sensory analysis of breads made from the optimal flour blend revealed no significant difference (p <= 0.05) from wheat flour for crumb and chewiness. Appreciation was brought to the appearance, crust, aroma, and taste in the optimized bread. This study suggests that chickpea flour can be suitably incorporated into bread wheat flour up to a percentage of 24% with 16% milk powder to produce bread with optimal nutritional quality while improving its sensory attributes and consumer acceptability.

It is of significance to study the effects of wetland drying on microbial regulation of soil carbon (C) in the desert. In this study, we examined the impacts of wetland drying on microbial biomass, microbial community (bacteria, fungi) and microbial activity [basal microbial respiration, microbial metabolic quotient (qCO(2))]. Relationships of microbial properties with biotic factors [litter, soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP)], abiotic factors (soil moisture, pH and clay content) and biological processes (basal microbial respiration, qCO(2)) were also developed. Results showed that the drying of wetland led to a decrease of soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) content, microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) content and fungi and bacterial abundance, and an increase of the fungi:bacteria ratio. Wetland drying also led to increased soil basal respiration and increased qCO(2), which was attributed to lower soil clay content and litter N concentration. The MBC:SOC ratios were higher under drier soil conditions than under virgin wetland, which was attributed to stronger C conserve ability of fungi than bacteria. The wetland drying process exacerbated soil C loss by strengthening heterotrophic respiration; however, the exact effects of soil microbial community structure on microbial C mineralization were not clear in this study and need further research.

Field datasets of eight seasons (2010-2017) of Maharashtra (India) used to study the influence of weather factors lagged by one week on soybean semilooper (Chrysodeixis acuta) pest status based on Kendall's correlations revealed significant and positive influence of maximum temperature (MaxT), MaxT deviation, minimum temperature (MinT), MinT deviation and rainfall (RF) with relative humidity (RH) influence significantly negative. The multiple linear regression (MLR) indicated the significance of MaxT, MaxT deviation, MinT deviation and RF, however with the totality of factors (R-2 = 0.04) accounting only four per cent of variations in semilooper. Nonlinear models individually and in hybrid mode fitted and tested using datasets indicated the best performance of hybrid of autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous variable (ARIMAX) with artificial neural network (ANN) i.e. ARIMAX-ANN over ANN or ARIMAX models. Performance of the non-linear models were evaluated based on statistical measures of mean square error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE). The proposed artificial intelligence based non-linear ARIMAX-ANN model has potential for forecasting current week's semilooper incidence on soybean one week in advance based on weather factors of previous week across Maharashtra.

Here, we investigated soil cumulative OC mineralization (C-min), specific OC mineralization (C-min/C-0, normalized by initial OC) and temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) with an 84-d incubation experiment after the conversion of cropland to artificial grassland (6, 10, 15 and 20 yr), to natural grassland (6, 10 and 20 yr) and to pea shrub woodland (10, 20 and 40 yr) in the agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China. Results showed that revegetation significantly increased C-min (from 38.21 to 57.79 mg kg(-1) soil, +51%) at the 0-10 cm depth but not the 10-20 cm depth, with greater increases after the conversion of cropland to artificial grassland (+77%) than the other two patterns but similar among different conversion years for each pattern. Variations in C-min among different re-vegetation patterns and times were mostly explained by changes in total nitrogen concentration (TN) in the macro-aggregate fraction. Across all treatments, 6.20-20.29 g kg(-1) OC was mineralized during the incubation and Q(10) was 1.16-2.40. The C-min/C-0 and Q(10) changed not significantly during the post-agricultural revegetation chmnosequences for each pattern, which were mostly due to the unchanged TN concentration in silt and clay fraction. Re-vegetation also changed the dependence of C-min, C-min/C-0 on N availability, with significant relationships in re-vegetated artificial grassland and pea shrub woodland which may due to the influence of legumes on microbes. In conclusion, OC mineralization increased with conversion, varying by re-vegetation type, while OC decomposability and temperature sensitivity were stable regardless of re-vegetation type and time, indicating the similar biodegradability and stability in face of warming.																			1164-5563	1778-3615				MAR-APR	2021	103								103278	10.1016/j.ejsobi.2021.103278	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejsobi.2021.103278		JAN 2021											WOS:000633040800001

Regardless of water shortages and associated challenges in dry areas, the irrigation of date palm trees consumes an excessive quantity of water annually using conventional irrigation methods. Therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate the effects of modern surface and subsurface micro-irrigation systems, i.e., subsurface drip irrigation (SSDI), controlled surface irrigation (CSI), and surface drip-irrigation methods (SDI), with different irrigation water regimes, i.e., 50%, 75%, and 100% irrigation water requirements (IWRs), on the yield and fruit quality of date palms (cv. Khalas) and water conservation in the dryland region of Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia. The effects of three irrigation methods and IWRs were studied on macronutrients and soil chemical properties at three depths (0-30, 30-60, and 60-90 cm), as well as on water productivity, yield, and the fruit quality of date palms. The study was carried out over two years and was designed using a two-factorial randomized complete block design (RCBD) with nine replications. The results indicated that electrical conductivity (EC) increased as the depth of the soil increased. The soil chemical properties did not change much in all experimental treatments, while soil pH values decreased with the soil depth from 0-30 to 60-90 cm. Although the maximum fruit yield (96.62 kg palm(-1)) was recorded when 100% irrigation water was applied in the SSDI system, other treatment combinations, such as SDI at 100% IWR (84.86 kg palm(-1)), SSDI at 75% IWR (84.84 kg palm(-1)), and CSI at 100% IWR (83.86 kg palm(-1)) behaved alike and showed promising results. Similarly, the highest irrigation water productivity (2.11 kg m(-3)) was observed in the SSDI system at 50% IWR, followed by the SSDI at 75% IWR (1.64 kg m(-3)) and 100% IWR (1.40 kg m(-3)). Fruit quality attributes were also promoted with the SSDI system at 75% IWR. Hence, the SSDI method at 75% IWR appeared to be an optimal choice for date palm irrigation in arid areas due to its positive impact on water conservation and fruit characteristics without affecting soil chemical properties.

ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Understanding how soil microorganisms influence the direction and magnitude of soil carbon feedback to global warming is vital to predict future climate change. Although microbial activities are major contributors to soil respiration (R-S) and its temperature sensitivity (Q(10)), the mechanisms underpinning microbial influence on R-S and Q(10) remain unclear. Coupling variation partitioning analysis (VPA), correlation analysis and multiple stepwise linear regression analysis, we illustrate that bacteria mainly affect R-S and its temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) by shifting bacterial community composition (denoted by principal coordinates analysis). We also found that soil water content (SWC) and available nutrient (AN) were the factor key to changing bacterial community composition (P < 0.05). Co-occurrence network demonstrated that Mod 0 ecological cluster composed of copiotrophic taxa groups was significantly associated with R-S and Q(10) (P < 0.01, R > 0.5), including Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Illuminating the mechanisms underpinning the influence of soil microbes on R-S and Q(10) values is fundamental to understanding mechanistic soil-climate carbon cycles.

Food security in the country hinges on rainfed systems in which maize and sorghum are staple cereals and groundnut and pigeonpea are now major grain legume crops. While the country has experienced a considerable reduction in forest lands, population growth and demand for food production have seen an increase in the area dedicated to agricultural crops. From 2010, pigeonpea developed into a major export crop, and is commonly intercropped with cereals or grown in double-up legume systems. Information on the spatial extent of these crops is useful for estimating food supply, understanding export potential, and planning policy changes as examples of various applications. Remote sensing analysis offers a number of efficient approaches to deliver spatial, reproducible data on land use and land cover (LULC) and changes therein. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products (fortnightly and monthly) and derived phenological parameters assist in mapping cropland areas during the agricultural season, with explicit focus on redistributed farmland. Owing to its low revisit time and the availability of long-term period data, MODIS offers several advantages, e.g., the possibility of obtaining cloud-free Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) profile and an analysis using one methodology applied to one sensor at regular acquisition dates, avoiding incomparable results. To assess the expansion of areas used in the production of pigeonpea and groundnut resulting from the release of new varieties, the spatial distribution of cropland areas was mapped using MODIS NDVI 16-day time-series products (MOD13Q1) at a spatial resolution of 250 m for the years 2010-2011 and 2016-2017. The resultant cropland extent map was validated using intensive ground survey data. Pigeonpea is mostly grown in the southern dry districts of Mulanje, Phalombe, Chiradzulu, Blantyre and Mwanza and parts of Balaka and Chikwawa as a groundnut-pigeonpea intercrop, and sorghum-pigeonpea intercrop in Mzimba district. By 2016, groundnut extent had increased in Mwanza, Mulanje, and Phalombe and fallen in Mzimba. The result indicates that the area planted with pigeonpea had increased by 29% (75,000 ha) from 2010-2011 to 2016-2017. Pigeonpea expansion in recent years has resulted from major export opportunities to Asian countries like India, and its consumption by Asian expatriates all over the world. This study provides useful information for policy changes and the prioritization of resources allocated to sustainable food production and to support smallholder farmers.

John; Kilian, Benjamin			Photoperiod Insensitivity in Pigeonpea Introgression Lines Derived from Wild <i>Cajanus</i> Species	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Pigeonpea is a photoperiod-sensitive crop; therefore, the introgression of photoperiod insensitivity could increase its adaptability to new environments. We determined the effect of extended daylength (ED; 16 h light) on the phenotypical traits of extra-early, early, and mid-early maturing pigeonpea introgression lines (ILs) derived from wild Cajanus species belonging to secondary and tertiary gene pools. Plants were grown under natural daylength and extended daylength in a greenhouse. Comparisons of the time of floral bud initiation, days to flowering, plant height, number of branches, and number of leaf nodes on the main stem at flowering revealed photoperiod-insensitive lines. All traits varied widely among the ILs. Analyses of flowering traits revealed large genetic components with low genotype x treatment interactions and high broad-sense heritability. The photoperiod most strongly affected the number of primary branches, followed by plant height. The extended day advanced flowering by approximately four days in extra-early ILs, confirming that these ILs are quantitative, short-day plants. The photoperiod insensitivity index varied from 0.88 in ICPP 171541 (moderately photoperiod sensitive) to 0.99 in ICPP 171546 and ICPP 171561 (photoperiod insensitive). These photoperiod-insensitive extra-early flowering ILs can be used to enrich the genetic diversity of pigeonpea and to develop photoperiod-insensitive cultivars for cultivation in new environments.

Winter wheat residue impact on soil water storage and subsequent corn yield	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Standing winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) residue can capture snow, reduce soil erosion and water evaporation, and increase crop yields in semi-arid environments. Solid-stemmed winter wheat (SSWW) varieties may remain standing longer in the field; however, SSWW consistently yields less than conventional hollow-stemmed winter wheat (HSWW). This research investigates if the negative economic impact of yield loss of SSWW may be overcome by increasing the subsequent corn (Zea mays L.) yield due to increased snow capture and soil moisture. The experiment covered two cycles of a wheat-corn-fallow rotation in two separate fields between 2016 and 2019 near Sidney, NE. Five wheat varieties were tested (four varieties HSWW and one SSWW). Treatments (variety) were arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications. 'Warhorse' (SSWW) and 'Settler CL' (HSWW) had the lowest grain yield (2,119 and 2,153 kg ha(-1), respectively) in a drier year. Warhorse (SSWW) residue did not persist standing longer in the field compared with other HSWW varieties. No advantage of SSWW over HSWW was observed in enhancing soil moisture for years with average precipitation during the corn growing season, and consequently, corn yield did not increase. These results suggest that SSWW should be considered only if the risk of crop failure from wheat stem sawfly (Cephus cinctus) would reduce HSWW grain yields below those achieved when using SSWW.

The objectives of this study were to identify the interactions between long-term land use and soil type on SHP (e.g., available water content [AWC], hydraulic conductivity [K]), and the effects of soil organic carbon (SOC) content on these properties. Soil water release curves and (near) saturated hydraulic conductivity at three soil depths (0-7.5, 7.5-15, and 15-30 cm) were measured under three long-term (>20 years) land uses (irrigated pasture [IP], dryland pasture [DP], and irrigated cropping [IC]) in Canterbury, New Zealand. For each land use, three soil types with contrasting drainage characteristics were selected: well-drained Lismore (LIS) stony silt loam, moderately well-drained Templeton (TEM) silt loam, and poorlydrained Waterton/Temuka (WAT) clay loam. Compared to DP, the IP and IC soils had lower AWC and K. Significant interactions between land use and soil type were found for AWC but not for K. Bulk density, SOC, and clay content could explain half the variation in AWC but had limited influence on K. More variance in AWC (6-13%) and K (5-27%) could be explained by including categorical variables (i.e., land use, soil type, and soil depth) and their interactions with continuous variables, indicating the potential benefit of including these categorical variables when developing pedotransfer functions for AWC and K. This study suggests that many macropores (>30 mu m) were poorly connected and contributed more to water storage than to conducting water. The commonly used soil matric potential of -10 kPa was suitable for defining field capacity in DP and IC soils but a lower matric potential (-33 kPa) was more appropriate for IP soil affected by livestock treading during grazing. Soil organic carbon mainly increased AWC by affecting water retention at soil matric potentials of between -40 and -1500 kPa (equivalent to pore size 0.2-7.5 mu m). Therefore, soil carbon sequestration may be important to alleviating water stress in dry environments. Our study also suggests that the effects of land use and its interaction with soil type, soil matric potential at field capacity, and soil organic carbon on SHP need to be considered during soil parameterization of hydrological models.

J	Yao, XM; Xiao, B; Kidron, GJ; Hu, KL				Yao, Xiaomeng; Xiao, Bo; Kidron, Giora J.; Hu, Kelin			Respiration rate of moss-dominated biocrusts and their relationships with temperature and moisture in a semiarid ecosystem	CATENA												Biocrusts are widely distributed throughout the world in dryland ecosystems, but their respiration rate (R-s) and responses to soil temperature and mositure have not yet been fully investigated. In a semiarid region of the Loess Plateau in China, the R-s of moss-dominated biocrusts was continuously (104 days) measured in summer through an automated soil respiration system, and their relationships with soil temperature and moisture at 2, 5, and 10 cm depths were intensively analyzed. The results showed the biocrusts had 115% higher (t = - 3.82, P < 0.001) R-s during day and 44% higher (t = -10.22, P < 0.001) R-s during night as compared with the underlying soil; they averagely increased R-s by 81% (2.52 vs. 1.39 mu mol(-2)s(-1)) across day and night. More specifically, the R-s of biocrusts ranged from 0.33 to 6.33 mu mol m(-2)s(-1) in wet conditions (soil moisture >= 0.15 cm(3) cm(-3)) and 0.27 to 2.83 mu mol m(2)s(-1) in dry conditions (soil moisture = 0.05 cm(3)cm(-3)), with a daily mean of 2.11 mu mol m(-2)s(-1). Particularly, in wet conditions the R-s of biocrusts had positive responses to increasing temperature, and their relationship was well fitted with an exponential function (R-2 <= 0.44; P < 0.001), with a Q(10) value ranging between 1.73 and 2.08. Similarly, the R-s of biocrusts was positively correlated with soil moisture, but their relationship was not well fitted with the quadratic function (R-2 <= 0.22). A model based on the soil moisture and temperature at 2 cm depth performed much better (R-2 = 0.53; P < 0.001) with R-s than that based on the soil moisture and temperature at 5 or 10 cm depth or even air temperature. In conclusion, moss biocrusts made a significant contribution to soil respiration in semiarid ecosystem, firstly (and directly) due to the rich and diversified microbial communities in biocrust layer and secondly (and indirectly) due to the biocrust effects on soil temperature and moisture regimes. The temperature and moisture at 2 cm depth (biocrust layer) should be employed with a higher priority in simulating R-s of biocrusted surfaces, rather than the commonly used soil depth (5 cm) in estimating R-s of the ordinary soil without biocrusts.

The aims of this study were to establish how different tillage and straw retention practices affect the soil aggregates and soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) contents in the aggregate fractions based on a long-term (approximately 15 years) field experiment in the semi-arid western Loess Plateau, northwestern China. The experiment included four soil treatments, i.e., conventional tillage with straw removed (T), conventional tillage with straw incorporated (TS), no tillage with straw removed (NT) and no tillage with straw retention (NTS), which were arranged in a complete randomized block design. The wet-sieving method was used to separate four size fractions of aggregates, namely, large macroaggregates (LA, >2000 mu m), small macroaggregates (SA, 250-2000 mu m), microaggregates (MA, 53-250 mu m), and silt and clay (SC, <53 mu m). Compared to the conventional tillage practices (including T and TS treatments), the percentages of the macroaggregate fractions (LA and SA) under the conservation tillage practices (including NT and NTS treatments) were increased by 41.2%-56.6%, with the NTS treatment having the greatest effect. For soil layers of 0-5, 5-10 and 10-30 cm, values of the mean weight diameter (MWD) under the TS and NTS treatments were 10.68%, 13.83% and 17.65%, respectively. They were 18.45%, 19.15% and 14.12% higher than those under the T treatment, respectively. The maximum contents of the aggregate-associated SOC and TN were detected in the SA fraction, with the greatest effect being observed for the NTS treatment. The SOC and TN contents were significantly higher under the NTS and TS treatments than under the T treatment. Also, the increases in SOC and TN levels were much higher in the straw-retention plots than in the straw-removed plots. The macroaggregates (including LA and SA fractions) were the major pools for SOC and TN, regardless of tillage practices, storing 3.25-6.81 g C/kg soil and 0.34-0.62 g N/kg soil. Based on the above results, we recommend the NTS treatment as the best option to boost soil aggregates and to reinforce carbon and nitrogen sequestration in soils in the semi-arid western Loess Plateau of northwestern China.

Accurate estimation of the sediment transport capacity (Tc) is critical for soil erosion models. Tc data for different levels of vegetation cover, however, are quite limited. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the influence of stem basal cover, slope gradient and discharge on the transport capacity of overland flows for Tc prediction. A non-erodible flume (5 m long and 0.37 m wide) was used in this study. The discharge ranged from 0.5 x 10(-3) to 2 x 10(-3) m(3) s(-1), the slope gradient was from 8.8% to 25.9% and an artificial stem basal cover of 0, 1.25%, 2.5%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% and 30% was used to represent the natural vegetation. Stems 2 mm in diameter were randomly arranged. The sediment size for the experiment ranged from 0.25 to 0.59 mm with a median diameter of 0.35 mm. The results show that the measured Tc decreased exponentially as the stem basal cover increased, and the rate of decrease was far greater than what has been reported in the literature. The transport capacity was affected more by the stem basal cover than by slope and discharge when the cover exceeded approximately 2-3%. The research shows that the surface or stem basal cover plays a critical role in reducing the transport capacity of overland flows.

Estimating the potential to close yield gaps through increased efficiency of chickpea production in Ethiopia	FOOD SECURITY												Improved cultivars and agronomic practices have significantly increased chickpea production in Ethiopia in recent decades. Enhanced availability of chickpeas in Ethiopia, therefore, contributes to food, nutrition, and income security of the country. However, we know relatively little about the extent to which farmers have harnessed the full potential of these improved technologies. In this paper, we compare the technical efficiencies and technological gap ratios of chickpea farming in three major chickpea-producing areas of Ethiopia using a two-step meta frontier model. Based on regionally representative data from 681 chickpea-growing farm households in the three regions, we show regional differences in the technical efficiencies, technological gap ratios, and meta technical efficiencies (MTEs). We examined the drivers of these different production levels and identified ways to increase chickpea production while minimizing yield gaps. Improving technical efficiency through improving farmers' access to improved seed, offering farmers need-based and gender-responsive extension support, encouraging their participation in technology development programs, and appropriate rainwater management would all contribute to harnessing the full potential of improved chickpea cultivars in Ethiopia.

However, limited attention has been devoted to distinguishing between actively cropped fields and fallowed fields within agricultural lands, and in particular so in grass fallow systems of semi-arid areas. In the Sahel, one of the largest dryland regions worldwide, crop-fallow rotation practices are widely used for soil fertility regeneration. Yet, little is known about the extent of fallow fields since fallow is not explicitly differentiated within the cropland class in any existing remote sensing-based land use/cover maps, regardless of the spatial scale. With a 10 m spatial resolution and a 5-day revisit frequency, Sentinel-2 satellite imagery made it possible to disentangle agricultural land into cropped and fallow fields, facilitated by Google Earth Engine (GEE) for big data handling. Here we produce the first Sahelian fallow field map at a 10 m resolution for the baseline year 2017, accomplished by designing a remote sensing driven protocol for generating reference data for mapping over large areas. Based on the 2015 Copernicus Dynamic Land Cover map at 100 m resolution, the extent of fallow fields in the cropland class is estimated to be 63% (403,617 km(2)) for the Sahel in 2017. Similar results are obtained for five contemporary cropland products, with fallow fields occupying 57-62% of the cropland area. Yet, it is noted that the total estimated area coverage depends on the quality of the different cropland products. The share of cropped fields within the Copernicus cropland area is found to be higher in the arid regions (200-300 mm rainfall) as compared to the semi-arid regions (300-600 mm rainfall). The woody cover fraction within cropped and fallow fields is found to have a reversed pattern between arid (higher woody cover in cropped fields) and semi-arid (higher woody cover in fallow fields) regions. The method developed, using cloud-based Earth Observation (EO) data and computation on the GEE platform, is expected to be reproducible for mapping the extent of fallow fields across global croplands. Future applications based on multi-year time series is expected to improve our understanding of crop-fallow rotation dynamics in grass fallow systems being key in teasing apart how cropland intensification and expansion affect environmental variables, such as soil fertility, crop yields and local livelihoods in low-income regions such as the Sahel.

However, knowledge regarding changes in the status and relative availability of inorganic nitrogen (IN) is still limited. To determine the responses of soil IN storage and its relative availability to revegetation patterns and chronosequence, a 0-200 cm soil profile was collected from two typical vegetation restoration patterns in the heartland of the region, artificial forestland (Robinia pseudoacacia) and natural grassland, with a stand age sequences of 15, 20, 25, 30 and 40 years. The farmland near the sites was selected as a control. As a whole, the NH4-N, NO3-N and total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) concentrations and stocks in the forestlands were significantly higher than those in the grasslands, especially in the topsoil (0-10 cm). With increasing revegetation chronosequence, afforestation improved soil NH4-N, NO3-N and TIN concentrations and stocks until Robinia pseudoacacia reached maturity at an age of 25-30, but abandoned on former farmland had minor effects on soil IN. After revegetation, soil NH4-N was higher than NO3-N, and the NH4-N/NO3-N ratio (ANR) was greater than 1 and increased with soil depth. The soil at 40-200 cm accounted for 60-90% of the total IN stock of the 0-200 cm soil profile, and the soil at 100-200 cm accounted for more than 35% of the total levels. Moreover, soil physicochemical properties were significantly correlated with soil IN variables, and ANR had a greater correlation coefficient with soil physicochemical properties than the other IN variables. It was concluded that afforestation was a better choice for soil IN restoration of degraded land, and subdeep and deep soil provided an extremely important resource for evaluating soil IN pools and their relative availability. Furthermore, soil IN dynamics, particularly ANR, could be regarded as indicators for assessing the dynamics of soil fertility.

Elite Swimmers' Training Patterns in the 25 Weeks Prior to Their Season's Best Performances: Insights Into Periodization From a 20-Years Cohort	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY												Background: This study investigated the periodization of elite swimmers' training over the 25 weeks preceding the major competition of the season. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study of elite male (n = 60) and female (n = 67) swimmers (46 sprint, 81 middle-distance) over 20 competitive seasons (1992-2012). The following variables were monitored: training corresponding to blood lactate <2 mmol.L (-1), 2 to <= 4 mmol.L-1, >4-6 mmol.L-1, >6 mmol.L-1, and maximal swimming speed; general conditioning and maximal strength training hours; total training load (TTL); and the mean normalized volumes for both in-water and dryland workouts. Latent class mixed modeling was used to identify various TTL pattern groups. The associations between pattern groups and sex, age, competition event, Olympic quadrennial year, training contents, and relative performance were quantified. Results: For the entire cohort, similar to 86-90% of the training was swum at an intensity of [La](b) <= 4 mmol.L-1. This training volume was divided into 40-44% at <2 mmol.L-1 and 44-46% at 2 to <= 4 mmol.L-1, leaving 6-9.5% at >4-6 mmol.L-1, and 3.5-4.5% at > 6 mmol.L-1. Three sprint TTL patterns were identified: a pattern with two long similar to 14-15-week macrocycles, one with two similar to 12-13 week macrocycles each composed of a balanced training load, and one with a single stable flat macrocycle. The long pattern elicited the fastest performances and was most prevalent in Olympic quadrennials (i.e., 4 seasons preceding the 2004, 2008, and 2012 Olympic Games). This pattern exhibited moderate week-to-week TTL variability (6 +/- 3%), progressive training load increases between macrocycles, and more training at <= 4 mmol.L(-1 )and >6 mmol.L-1. This fastest sprint pattern showed a waveform in the second macrocycle consisting of two progressive load peaks 10-11 and 4-6 weeks before competition. The stable flat pattern was the slowest and showed low TTL variability (4 +/- 3%), training load decreases between macrocycles (P < 0.01), and more training at 4-6 mmol.L-1 (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Progressive increases in training load, macrocycles lasting about 14-15 weeks, and substantial volume of training at intensities <= 4 mmol.L-1 and >6 mmol.L-1, were associated with peak performance in elite swimmers.

The utilization of N by poplar largely depends on fertilizer application patterns; however, the underlying regulatory hubs are not fully understood. In this study, N utilization and potentially physiological regulations of two poplar clones (XQH and BC5) were assessed through two related experiments (i: five levels of N supply and ii: conventional and exponential N additions). Poplar growth (leaf area) and N utilization significantly increased under fertilized compared to unfertilized conditions, whereas photosynthetic N utilization efficiency significantly decreased under low N supplies. Growth characteristics were better in the XQH than in the BC5 clone under the same N supplies, indicating higher N utilization efficiency. Leaf absorbed light energy, and thermal dissipation fraction was significantly different for XQH clone between conventional and exponential N additions. Leaf concentrations of putrescine (Put) and acetylated Put were significantly higher in exponential than in conventional N addition. Photorespiration significantly increased in leaves of XQH clone under exponential compared to conventional N addition. Our results indicate that an interaction of the clone and N supply pattern significantly occurs in poplar growth; leaf expansion and the storage N allocations are the central hubs in the regulation of poplar N utilization.

Using Bioacoustics to Examine Vocal Phenology of Neotropical Migratory Birds on a Wild and Scenic River in Arizona	BIRDS												Simple Summary Rivers can support forests of trees that mostly rely on water provided by the river. This area between the land and river is called riparian. In arid regions, that do not receive much rainfall, these riparian forests are very rare and support many unique bird species. Some songbirds migrate between North American and Central and South America and only nest in riparian forests. We used acoustic recorders which are instruments fitted with a microphone to record sound. We measured how many days during the summer four migratory birds were detected by their vocalizations in the riparian forest. We found that using acoustic recorders can be an effective way to document bird vocalization over time and in remote areas. Forests along rivers need water and are important to support a diversity of migratory birds.Abstract Passive acoustic recorders have been used successfully as automated survey tools to detect terrestrial wildlife. However, few studies have monitored Neotropical migratory bird use of riparian forest habitat using this technology. Within dryland ecosystems, the forests along rivers support high bird diversity. Many bird species of conservation concern require these floodplain forest habitats for foraging, migration stop-overs, and breeding. Few studies have explored the use of acoustic records in riverine systems designated for conservation for their natural resource value via the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act in the USA. Using acoustic recorders, we document vocal activity of four riparian-obligate species (Bell's Vireo, Vireo bellii; Summer Tanager, Piranga rubra; Yellow Warbler, Setophaga petechial; and Yellow-billed Cuckoo, Coccyzus americanus) to determine species occurrence along a Wild and Scenic River. We established three study reaches along the perennial Lower Verde River, in the Sonoran Desert of central Arizona, USA. Nine acoustic recorders were used over the period of 80-120 days during the summer of 2018. We measured vegetation composition and structure in 100 m2 plots paired with acoustic recorders. Visualizing vocal activity showed that three species were calling and singing at each reach; whereas, one species, the cuckoo, had fewer recordings and occurred later in the summer. We demonstrate the utility of acoustic monitoring even when applied to rare birds in complex riparian habitats. This information is important for land management and conservation efforts concerning these species of interest and identifying important habitat features in Southwestern US riparian woodlands.

Mapping soil slaking index and assessing the impact of management in a mixed agricultural landscape	SOIL												Soil aggregate stability is a useful indicator of soil physical health and can be used to monitor condition through time. A novel method of quantifying soil aggregate stability, based on the relative increase in the footprint area of aggregates as they disintegrate when immersed in water, has been developed and can be performed using a smartphone application - SLAKES. In this study the SLAKES application was used to obtain slaking index (SI) values of topsoil samples (0 to 10 cm) at 158 sites to assess aggregate stability in a mixed agricultural landscape. A large range in SI values of 0 to 7.3 was observed. Soil properties and land use were found to be correlated with observed SI values. Soils with clay content > 25 % and cation exchange capacity (CEC) : clay ratio > 0.5 had the highest observed SI values. Variation in SI for these soils was driven by organic carbon (OC) content which fit a segmented exponential decay function. An OC threshold of 1.1 % was observed, below which the most extreme SI values were observed. Soils under dryland and irrigated cropping had lower OC content and higher observed SI values compared to soils under perennial cover. These results suggest that farm managers can mitigate the effects of extreme slaking by implementing management practices to increase OC content, such as minimum tillage or cover cropping. A regression-kriging method utilising a Cubist model with a suite of spatial covariates was used to map SI across the study area. Accurate predictions were produced with leave-one-out cross-validation, giving a Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC) of 0.85 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.1. Similar validation metrics were observed in an independent test set of samples consisting of 50 observations (LCCC = 0.82; RMSE = 1.1). The potential impact of implementing management practices that promote soil OC sequestration on SI values in the study area was explored by simulating how a 0.5 and 1.0 % increase in OC would impact SI values at observation points and then mapping this across the study area. Overall, the maps produced in this study have the potential to guide management decisions by identifying areas that currently experience extreme slaking and highlighting areas that are expected to have a significant reduction in slaking by increasing OC content.

Micronutrients limiting pasture production in Australia	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE					Australian-Grassland-Association (AGA) Research Symposium on Soil Constraints on Pasture Productivity	FEB 12-14, 2019	Launceston, AUSTRALIA	Australian Grassland Assoc				Low levels of plant-available micronutrients were an inherent feature of many agricultural soils in Australia, mostly due to the prevalence of highly weathered soil parent materials. The diagnosis and correction of the widespread deficiencies of micronutrients, especially copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo) and zinc (Zn), were prerequisites for the development of productive, legume-based pastures in southern Australia. In subtropical and tropical regions, Mo deficiency commonly limited pasture-legume production. Soil treatments involving micronutrient fertiliser incorporated in soils, or applied as additives to superphosphate, were generally effective in alleviating micronutrient deficiencies. In the low-output dryland pasture systems, the annual removal of micronutrients in wool and meat is small compared with rates added in fertiliser. Hence, in general, the residues of soil-applied micronutrient fertilisers remain effective for many years, for example, up to 30 years for Cu. By contrast, shorter residual values occur for manganese (Mn) fertiliser on highly calcareous soils, and for Zn in high-output pasture systems such as intensive dairy production. In the last two decades since the recommendations for micronutrient management of pastures were developed, there have been many changes to farming systems, with likely implications for micronutrient status in pastures. First, increased cropping intensity and low prices for wool and meat have meant lower nutrient inputs to pastures or to the pasture phase of rotations with crops. However, when pastures have been rotated with crops, ongoing small additions of Cu, Zn and Mo have been common. In cropping phases of farming systems, lime application and no-till may have altered the chemical and positional availability of micronutrients in soils to pastures. However, there has been little study of the impacts of these farming-systems changes on micronutrient status of pastures or profitability of the production system. The intensification of dairy production systems may also have altered the demand for, and removal rates of, micronutrients. Soil tests are not very reliable for Mn or Mo deficiencies, and well-calibrated soil tests for boron, Cu and Zn have been developed only for limited areas of pasture production and for a limited range of species. There is limited use of plant tests for nutrient management of pastures. In conclusion, there is limited knowledge of the current micronutrient status of pastures and their effects on animal health. Pasture production would benefit from targeted investigation of micronutrients status of pasture soils, pasture plants and micronutrient-linked animal-health issues.

Critical Zone Water Balance Over 13 Years in a Semiarid Savanna	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Quantifying how much and when precipitation (P) becomes runoff (R), evapotranspiration (ET), and drainage from the root zone (D) is key to understanding how climate and land use impact hydrology of the critical zone. We quantify water balance dynamics of a semiarid savanna with a summer/winter rainfall pattern with 13years of water fluxes and soil moisture. We find multiyear P is partitioned 96% to ET and 7% to R, while D (-3%) is negligible when considering measurement uncertainty. While weather regulates ET over diurnal time scales, soil water inputs control seasonal to annual ET amounts. Seasonal water availability, estimated by soil moisture inputs, is more closely tracked by ET rather than time-averaged soil moisture or P. Surprisingly, we find significant, episodic carryover of soil moisture from the summer to spring growing season. Abundant late-summer P can supply ET in the subsequent spring, even after multimonth dry periods. However, over an annual cycle beginning in early summer, nearly all soil moisture is used by ET. Likewise, D beyond the monitored root zone, assisted by downward hydraulic distribution in plant roots, occurs within a season, but this is counteracted by subsequent ET extraction of deep moisture over the year. Thus, negligible long-term D occurs, though there is considerable uncertainty in estimation of this small flux as the residual of much larger ones. These comprehensive, long-term measurements support expectations about the overriding importance of ET in the dryland critical zone water balance and reveal an unexpected degree of interseasonal water storage. Plain Language Summary One of the most enduring and important questions for hydrology is how water input in the form of precipitation is partitioned among evapotranspiration, runoff, groundwater recharge, and storage of moisture in the soil. We quantified how precipitation was partitioned at a semiarid savanna site in Arizona, USA, with 13 years of data. We found that almost all of the precipitation goes into evapotranspiration with only a small of runoff and negligible recharge. Contrary to expectations, we saw significant, episodic carryover of soil moisture from the summer/fall growing season to the subsequent springtime when the plants awake from winter dormancy and extract the stored moisture. These comprehensive, long-term measurements support expectations about the overriding importance of ET in semiarid watersheds' water balance and reveal a surprising degree of interseasonal water storage.

Soil organic carbon storage (SOCS) under different land uses in the two catenas decreased significantly in the upper soil layers (<50 cm) but was relatively stable in the deeper soil layers (>50 cm). However, soil inorganic carbon storage (SICS) in the two catenas fluctuated (two maxima) with increasing soil depth. There was no significant difference of SOCS within the 200 cm soil profile between forestlands (FO) and grasslands (GR) at the catenary scale (p > 0.05). However, SICS in the 0-200 cm soil profile differed markedly between FO and GR (p < 0.05) in both catenas due to different degrees of root-facilitated CaCO3 redistribution. Based on the coefficient of variance (CV), soil water storage (SWS) was divided into three layers: active layer (0-100 cm, CV = 20%-30%), subactive layer (100-200 cm, CV = 10%-20%), and stable layer (200-500 cm, CV < 10%). The SWS in the 0-500 cm soil profile was slightly higher in GR than in FO on the two slopes because of the higher water consumption under tree plantation than native grasses. SOCS, SICS, and SWS can be predicted by multiple regression equations using different soil properties. The study demonstrated that SOCS, SICS, and SWS respond differently to vegetation restoration at the catenary scale, which must be taken into account for improving ecosystem model predictions of soil carbon and water fluxes in sloping lands.																			0008-4271	1918-1841				SEP	2020	100	3					263	277		10.1139/cjss-2019-0144	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjss-2019-0144													WOS:000566331500009

The Atacama Desert is of particular interest as it is considered to be the driest region on Earth. We have performed simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model over the Atacama Desert for two week-long periods in the austral winter season coincident with surface temperature and relative humidity in-situ observations at three sites. We found that the WRF model generally overestimates the daytime surface temperature, with biases of up to 11 degrees C, despite giving a good simulation of the relative humidity. In order to improve the agreement with observed measurements, we conducted sensitivity experiments in which the surface albedo, soil moisture content and five tuneable parameters in the Noah Land Surface Model (namely soil porosity, soil suction, saturated soil hydraulic conductivity, the b parameter used in hydraulic functions and the quartz fraction) are perturbed. We concluded that an accurate simulation is not possible, most likely because the Noah Land Surface Model does not have a groundwater table that may be shallow in desert regions. The WRF-predicted land surface temperature is also evaluated against that estimated from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. While at night the satellite-derived and ground-based measurements are generally in agreement, during the day MODIS estimates are typically lower by as much as 17 degrees C. This is attributed to the large uncertainty in the MODIS-estimated land surface temperatures in arid and semi-arid regions. The findings of this work highlight the need for ground-based observational networks in remote regions such as the Atacama Desert where satellite-derived and model products may not be very accurate.

Plant residue mulch increases measured and modelled soil moisture content in the effective root zone of maize in semi-arid Kenya	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Difficulties in efficient utilization of seasonal precipitation cause limitations in yields and even total crop failure on rainfed farms in semi-arid East Africa. The objective of the present study was to find out if covering the soil with plant residue mulch at a semi-arid site could retain water in the soil between precipitation events and build dry spell resilience by reducing soil water evaporation and increasing infiltration to deeper soil. Covering soil with plant residue mulch was studied at a smallholder farm in semi-arid Kenya by continuously measuring volumetric soil moisture content with soil sensors at multiple depths in bare soil and in maize (Zea mays L.) plant residue mulched soil. A physically based one-dimensional soil moisture model was calibrated and used to estimate the effect of plant residue mulch on soil moisture over a two-year period (multiple growing seasons). The modelled multiyear time series provides an estimate of the effect residue mulches of different thicknesses have on soil moisture over time. The simple soil moisture model was able to estimate soil moisture in the effective root zone of maize. By comparing measured data from mulched and uncovered soil and by model prediction, it was demonstrated that maize residue mulch conserved soil moisture over time in the effective root zone of maize compared to bare soil. During the two-year period mulching increased the total amount of days when measured relative soil moisture (s) exceeded water stress limit of maize (s*) by 24%-46%. Moisture accumulated in the mulched profile, especially in the deeper layers of the effective root zone. Calculations indicated that further increasing mulch thickness (delta(m)) from 1 to 3 cm would have increased the total days when s > s* 59%. Furthermore, increasing delta(m) from 3 to 5 cm would have resulted in 25% increase in total days when s > s*. According to our calculations mulching (delta(m) > 1 cm) could have maintained s > s* throughout a 19 days dry spell that occurred during the measurement period. The demonstrated moisture conserving effect of mulch increases with delta(m), but availability of plant residue may set limits on mulch application rates. The results suggest that maize residue mulching is as an accessible and feasible method for conserving soil moisture in the effective root zone in dryland smallholder systems in East Africa.

The Chinese government emphasized that rehabilitated agriculture, such as current government-led fallow, should be developed in the FPENC. However, what kind of farmland needs to lay fallow, how to manage the fields during fallow periods, and the duration of fallow periods are unclear. Fortunately, the green-depressing cropping system (GDCS) (Yaqing in Chinese Pinyin) that has existed for approximately 300 years also as a farmland use practice to reduce farmland use intensity and to recover soil property has something in common with fallow in the field selection and field management, and can serve as the reference for specific fallow policy. Therefore, we aimed to improve our limited understanding of the GDCS and provide recommendations for future fallow policies. Given this, an approach using satellite data to map the GDCS fields was explored, and this information can be combined with a questionnaire survey to help understand the current state of the GDCS in the FPENC. Then, the factors influencing farmers' willingness to adopt the GDCS in the FPENC were evaluated using a binary logistic regression model (BLR). The results indicated that the GDCS was still a widely distributed and common land use practice in the FPENC, and approximately 3.34 % and 2.31 % of the total arable land of Shangdu experienced the GDCS in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Furthermore, farmers in the Houshan area had a higher willingness to adopt the GDCS than farmers in the Qianshan area. More specifically, passive GDCS predominated as a suboptimal choice due to severe drought, while older farmers and agro-pastoral households had a higher willingness to adopt an active GDCS. Ultimately, the GDCS plays an important role in improving soil fertility and conserving soil water, leading to an increase of at least 50 % in crop yields in the year immediately following implementation. Finally, according to the current state of the GDCS and factor analysis, we concluded that the future fallow program in FPENC should be first performed in regions with high proportions of dryland and sloping fields, a small resident population, high levels of mechanization and high farmland transfer rates. Additionally, fallow by omitting a year of cropping is enough for farmland to recover, and different fallow subsidies are required to encourage farmers to implement this practice.					meng, li/HTQ-7341-2023; Jiang, Yuan/JED-3759-2023; meng, li/GVT-2063-2022; chen, xin/AFW-2129-2022	chen, xin/0000-0003-4959-8894													0264-8377	1873-5754				JAN	2021	100								104917	10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.104917	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.104917													WOS:000598930300013

Plastic film mulching has been extensively utilized in dryland agriculture on the Loess Plateau. However, higher topsoil temperatures under film mulch caused rainfed-maize premature senescence and yield loss. Here, we aimed to explore the influence of topsoil temperature driven by novel double mulching patterns on rainfed maize productivity based on the excellent moisture conservation function of plastic film. A maize field experiment was conducted in two different areas, namely Changwu, a typical semi-arid area, and Yangling, a dry semi-humid area. The experiment followed a randomized block design with three replications. Five flat-planting practices were examined in 2021 and 2022: (1) bare land (CK), (2) transparent film mulching (PFM), (3) black film mulching (BFM), (4) double mulching of PFM with a black polyethylene net (PFM + BN), and (5) double mulching of PFM with whole maize stalks (PFM + ST). Soil hydrothermal conditions, maize growth dynamics, grain yield, water use efficiency (WUE), and economic returns were quantified under different mulching practices. Under double mulching treatments, topsoil temperatures were lower than PFM by 1.7-2.0 degrees C at the two sites (p < 0.05), whereas BFM was slightly lower than that of PFM by 0.6-0.7 degrees C at Yangling (p > 0.05). The average growth period for maize under double mulching was longer than that under PFM by 8-11 days at the two sites. Double mulching treatments significantly improved the leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll relative content (SPAD), and aboveground biomass compared to CK and PFM during the late growth stage. Compared with PFM, average grain yield increased by 14.93%, 18.46%, and 16.45% in Changwu (p < 0.05) under BFM, PFM + BN, and PFM + ST, respectively, and by 2.71%, 24.55%, and 20.38% in Yangling. The corresponding WUEs also increased. Additionally, net income under BFM was higher than that under other treatments, and there were no significant (p > 0.05) differences between PFM + ST and BFM in Changwu. However, PFM + ST in net income averaged 10.72-52.22% higher than other treatments, and its output value was 19.51% higher in Yangling. In summary, smallholder farmers can adopt PFM + ST to improve rainfed-maize productivity in the Loess Plateau in China.																				2073-4395				NOV	2023	13	11							2790	10.3390/agronomy13112790	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13112790													WOS:001122791900001
J	Chen, YS; Zhang, SH; Li, HL; Wang, YD				Chen, Yusen; Zhang, Shihang; Li, Huiliang; Wang, Yongdong			Drivers of nutrient content and spatial variability of soil multifunctionality in the topsoil of Kyrgyzstan	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Soil nutrient status is a crucial measure of soil fertility, which not only coordinates and provides the nutrients necessary for plant growth, but also stimulates the decomposition of soil humus and biogeochemical cycles. Therefore, understanding the distribution characteristics of soil nutrients in the Kyrgyzstan, while exploring the drivers of their variability, is important for understanding ecological processes and the distribution of soil resources. Simultaneously, the study of the spatial distribution of soil multifunctionality and its drivers across Kyrgyzstan can better elucidate the functions of the entire ecosystem, assist in optimizing the allocation of resources and serve as a reference material for the scientific and rational management of the country's soil ecosystems. In this paper, We have used field sampling data from Kyrgyzstan, to examined the geographic variability and distribution of soil nutrients and soil multifunctionality within different soil depths, as well as the drivers in the country, using a combination of factor analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings indicated: (1)The topsoil of Kyrgyzstan (0-30 cm) stores 4.24 +/- 0.59 Pg of SOC, 0.33 +/- 0.06 Pg of total nitrogen (TN), 0.31 +/- 0.03 Pg of total phosphorus (TP), and 5.12 +/- 1.84 Pg of total potassium (TK). The nutrient reserves of various land-cover categories vary greatly across the nation, with grasslands accounting for the largest reserves (40%) but urban areas allocating the smallest proportion (0.3%). (2): the analysis revealed that using the linear or nonlinear fitting equations, the majority of soil nutrients exhibited a strong correlation with each other and also environmental parameters; (3): in Kyrgyzstan, soil multifunctionality varied substantially from -0.63 to 2.30 across regions. (4): according to the SEM results, NPP, wind speed (VS), MAP, longitude (Lon), SWC, and pH directly affected soil multifunctionality. In addition, several indirect effects of ST, MAT, Sard, and latitude (Lat) on soil multifunctionality were observed. Lon, map, SWC, and pH also had various direct and indirect impacts on soil multifunctionality. The findings of this study shed light on the functions of the entire soil ecosystem in the Kyrgyz Republic that help better predict the effects of environmental changes on ecosystem multifunctionality in drylands and provide a scientific basis for rational utilization of soil resources, efficient management of dryland soils, and prevention of land productivity decline in the country.																				2296-665X				SEP 23	2022	10								1001984	10.3389/fenvs.2022.1001984	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.1001984													WOS:000875334800001
J	Levi, N; Karnieli, A; Paz-Kagan, T				Levi, Nathan; Karnieli, Arnon; Paz-Kagan, Tarin			Using reflectance spectroscopy for detecting land-use effects on soil quality in drylands	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												The rapid growth in the global population over the past few decades has resulted in the transformation of many natural ecosystems into human-dominated ones. Land-use (LU) dynamics are accompanied by an increase in resource exploitation, often causing deteriorated environmental conditions that are reflected in the soil quality. Soil quality differences between LUs can be observed and measured using near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) methods. The research goal was to apply, measure, and evaluate soil properties based solely on the spectral differences between both natural and human-dominated LU practices, in the dryland environment of the central Negev Desert, Israel. This goal was achieved through the development and implementation of chemometrics techniques that were generated from soil point spectroscopy. Soil quality index (SQI) values, based on 14 physical, biological, and chemical soil properties, were quantified and compared between LUs and geographical units across the study area. Laboratory spectral measurements of soil samples were applied. Significant differences in SQI values were found between the geographical units. The statistical and mathematical methods for evaluating the soil properties' spectral differences included principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares-regression (PLS-R), and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PIS-DA). Correlations between predicted spectral values and measured soil properties and SQI were calculated using PLS-R and evaluated by the coefficient of determination (R-2), the Root Mean Square Error of Calibration, and Cross-Validation (RMSEC and RMSECV), and the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD). The PLS-R managed to produce "excellent" and "good" prediction values for some of the soil properties, including EC, Cl, Na, Ca + Mg, SAR, NO3, P, and SOM. Results of the PLS-R model for SQI are R-2 = 0.90, RPD = 2.46, RMSEC = 0.034, and RMSECV = 0.057. The PLS-DA classification of the laboratory spectroscopy was applied and resulted in high accuracy and kappa coefficient values when comparing LUs. In contrast, comparing the sampling sites resulted in lower overall accuracy (Acc = 0.82) and kappa values (K-c = 0.80). It is concluded that differentiation between physical, biological, and chemical soil properties, based on their spectral differences, is the key feature in the successful results for recognizing and characterizing various soil processes in an integrative approach. The results prove that soil quality and most soil properties can be successfully monitored and evaluated using NIRS in a comprehensive, non-destructive, time- and cost-efficient method.

Over the last 20years, it has been the target of a series of policies that encourage conversion of agricultural land to plantation forest. Remote sensing has a key role in measuring trends in the area of plantation forest observed across the landscape and hence the effectiveness of policy initiatives. Despite its importance to land use policy, accurate data on historical land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics of two spectrally similar but ecologically distinct forest types - such as native forest and plantation forest - are not readily available for south-western Australia, largely due to prohibitive data delivery costs. However, we argue that regular low-cost monitoring of long-term change in the spatial distribution of plantation forest through remote sensing is a critical input into environmental policy for the catchment. To this end, a 35-year time-series of Landsat imagery was acquired, and three different classifiers were tested (Support Vector Machines - SVM; Random Forests - RF; and Classification and Regression Trees - CART) on spectral and textural indices applied to four spectral bands. The six major LULC classes considered were agriculture, water, native forest, sand dunes, plantation forest and harvested native forest. In classifying the imagery the SVM and RF outperformed the CART across all classes. However, the SVM classifier gave a slightly higher F-score for most individual classes than the RF. Eucalypt dominated plantation forest reaching full canopy cover was subject to the highest rates of misclassification inasmuch as it shares spectral properties with the Eucalypt dominant native forest. When applied to Landsat time-series imagery, SVM classifier combined with four bands held in common between the four Landsat sensors, and derived textures metrics are valuable in classifying plantation and native forest, particularly where these have a similar species composition. The differences in prediction accuracy when including additional Landsat bands were not statistically significant, as demonstrated by the McNemar test. Thus, we achieved a trade-off in reducing processing time without significantly impacting on classification accuracy (86%). The relatively high accuracy of the proposed method enables the effects of past policy initiatives to be observed, and hence the efficient design of environmental and conservation policy in the future.

However, long-term NT may increase soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrient stratification, soil acidification, compaction, and herbicide resistance in weeds. Targeted strategic disturbance of continuous no-tillage is occasionally practiced to overcome challenges of long-term no-tillage, yet limited information is available on their impacts on SOC and nitrogen (N) components. We evaluated the response of SOC and N fractions to different tillage practices after the imposition of one-time strategic minimum tillage operation (i.e., stubble mulch tillage: SMT) in a continuous NT system in semi-arid drylands. Tillage treatments included conventional tillage (CT), NT, SMT, and strip-tillage (ST). The CT, NT, and ST plots were established in 2013, and SMT plots were established with only one pass of stubble mulch tillage in september of 2019 in long-term NT plots. Soil samples were collected from 0 to 15 and 15-30 cm depth of each plot before SMT and 2-days, 7-months, 14-months, 19-months, and 26-months after SMT implementation. The CT management resulted in 12-27% and 11-16% lower SOC concentration than under NT, SMT, and ST in 0-15 and 15-30 cm depth, respectively. The CT and ST had 22-53%, 44-79%, and 43% greater soil inorganic N than NT and SMT after 2-days, 7-months, and 19-months, respectively, in 0-15 cm depth. The 3d-carbon dioxide-carbon (CO2-C) was 32-65%, 48-65%, 62-102%, and 122-195% greater under CT and ST than under NT and SMT after 2-days, 7-months, 19-months, and 26-months, respectively, in 0-15 cm depth. The microbial biomass carbon (MBC) showed varying responses, with 31-64% lower MBC after 2-days and 26-months, but it was 35-39% greater after 7-months under CT than under NT and SMT. There was no difference between NT and SMT systems on SOC and N fractions for most of the samplings. Further research may reveal how often SMT can be utilized in a long-term NT system without negative impacts on soil properties in semi-arid dryland cropping systems. This study showed one stubble mulch tillage after six years of continuous NT did not affect SOC and N concentrations in 0-30 cm depth.

Objectives: This paper assesses the initial responses of major farming and food systems to COVID-19 in 25 Asian countries, and considers the implications for resilience, food and nutrition security and recovery policies by the governments. Methods: A conceptual systems model was specified including key pathways linking the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 to the resilience and performance of the four principal Asian farming and food systems, viz, lowland rice based; irrigated wheat based; hill mixed; and dryland mixed systems. Based on this framework, a systematic survey of 2504 key informants (4% policy makers, 6% researchers or University staff, 6% extension workers, 65% farmers, and 19% others) in 20 Asian countries was conducted and the results assessed and analysed. Results and conclusion: The principal Asian farming and food systems were moderately resilient to COVID-19, reinforced by government policies in many countries that prioritized food availability and affordability. Rural livelihoods and food security were affected primarily because of disruptions to local labour markets (especially for off-farm work), farm produce markets (notably for perishable foods) and input supply chains (i.e., seeds and fertilisers). The overall effects on system performance were most severe in the irrigated wheat based system and least severe in the hill mixed system, associated in the latter case with greater resilience and diversification and less dependence on external inputs and long market chains. Farming and food systems' resilience and sustain ability are critical considerations for recovery policies and programmes, especially in relation to economic performance that initially recovered more slowly than productivity, natural resources status and social capital. Overall, the resilience of Asian farming and food systems was strong because of inherent systems characteristics reinforced by public policies that prioritized staple food production and distribution as well as complementary welfare programmes. With the substantial risks to plant-and animal-sourced food supplies from future zoonoses and the institutional vulnerabilities revealed by COVID-19, efforts to improve resilience should be central to recovery programmes. Significance: This study was the first Asia-wide systems assessment of the effects of COVID-19 on agriculture and food systems, differentiating the effects of the pandemic across the four principal regional farming and food systems in the region.

J	Vu, DH; Stuerz, S; Asch, F				Vu, Duy Hoang; Stuerz, Sabine; Asch, Folkard			Rice-weed competition in response to nitrogen form under high and low transpirational demand	JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE												Implementation of water-saving irrigation practices in lowland rice results in increased availability of nitrate (NO3-) in the soil and favours germination of upland weeds. Since plant species show a specific preference for either ammonium (NH4+) or NO3- as nitrogen (N) source, changes in both soil NO3- concentration and weed flora may affect the competition between rice and weeds. Further, the transpirational demand of the atmosphere might affect growth and competitiveness of lowland (wetland) and upland (dryland) weeds differently due to their adaptation to different ecological environments. Therefore, the study aimed to evaluate the effects of N source on growth, N uptake and competition between rice and common upland and lowland weeds under high and low vapour pressure deficit (VPD). Two rice (Oryza sativa) varieties (NU838 and KD18) differing in growth characteristics and two weed species (Echinochloa crus-galli and Solanum nigrum) differing in their natural habitat were selected and grown hydroponically as monoculture or mixed culture at low or high VPD. N was supplied as 75%/25% or 25%/75% NH4+/NO3-. N uptake rates were measured in the first week, whereas dry matter (DM), N concentration in the plant, total N uptake and the activities of nitrate reductase and glutamine synthetase in the fresh leaves were determined two weeks after the onset of treatments. Independent of N source, both rice varieties and E. crus-galli took up a larger share of NH4+, whereas S. nigrum took up a larger share of NO3-. N uptake of rice and E. crus-galli was hardly affected by N source, whereas high NO3- led to significantly higher N uptake rates and total N uptake of S. nigrum. NU838 showed a higher competitiveness against weeds than KD18. In competition, high NO3- decreased the competitiveness of E. crus-galli against NU838 but increased the competitiveness of S. nigrum against NU838. High VPD did not affect DM but increased N uptake of S. nigrum, leading to increased competitiveness of the weed at high transpirational demand. Competitiveness for N uptake appears to be an important trait as the relative N concentration in mixed plant communities was correlated with the activity of N-assimilating enzymes and leaf growth, with a stronger response in rice than in weeds. Our results support the hypothesis that increased availability of NO3- in aerobic rice soils may be advantageous for the competitiveness of upland weeds, especially at high VPD, whereas it may be disadvantageous for common lowland weeds.

The objective of this study was to assess some key properties of a cemented, fine-grained bed stratum, previously characterized as a fiuvio-pedogenic unit (FPU), as well as those of the overlying non-cohesive gravel bed stratum, known as a fluvially active unit (FAU). While the latter is an outcome of regular fluvial processes of recurring scour and fill, the former is characterized by horizonation, calcium carbonate deposition, oxidation, and accumulation of fine-grained material, defining it more as a soil or pseudo soil than as a sediment. The study was conducted in the hyper-arid southern Negev and Arava Valley of Israel, where the FAU and the underlying FPU were investigated, focusing on geo-ecological functioning. The results revealed considerable differences between the two types of strata. The contents of hygroscopic moisture, total organic carbon, and calcium carbonate were fourfold, 57%, and 36% greater, respectively, in the FPU than these in the FAU. Above all, the fine particle contents, including the clay and silt fractions, were almost eightfold and almost sixfold greater, respectively, for the FPU than those for the FAU, characterizing the former as loamy fine sand and the latter as fine sand. Altogether, these properties determine the stratum's field capacity and permanent wilting point, which were 73% and 50% greater, respectively, in the FPU than those in the FAU. In turn, the last two properties determine the available water capacity, which was almost twofold greater under the FPU than that under the FAU. Considering the (i) FPU's mean thickness of 0.6 m; (ii) FPU's horizonation into A, B, and C horizons; and (iii) a 70-90% decrease in available water capacity between FPU's A and B horizons, as well as between its B and C horizons, then the total available water capacity throughout this stratum's thickness is 20-87% greater under the FPU than that under the FAU. In addition, the FPU's cemented nature seems to provide a safe stratum that remains stable during floods, sustaining the establishment and growth of deep-rooted perennial vegetation. It is concluded that the FUP's properties have positive implications for vegetation growth and survival under the harsh climatic conditions across the region.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				FEB	2019	173						505	510		10.1016/j.catena.2018.10.046	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2018.10.046													WOS:000452814300049

In parallel, substantial amounts of other biomass sources, such as residues from agricultural or urban processes, are still little used or wholly wasted, fudging the opportunity to generate new value chains based on these biomass sources. We hypothesize that using these non-traditional biomass sources to produce biofuels would significantly increase the regional bioenergy supply. In this context, this article discusses the potential for the production and use of biofuels and bioenergy in Northeast Brazil and its effects on regional development, which may be useful for both private actors and policymakers in the energy sector. The use of biomass sources for energy in the region is significant, reaching approximately 8.8 million tons of oil equivalent (toe) per year, emphasizing the already consolidated production of sugarcane and its derivatives. The use of all biomass resources in the Northeast region could supply around 4% of the Brazilian national electrical energy demand, with an environmental footprint of 0.055 tCO(2eq) per toe, which would contribute to reducing emissions from the Brazilian energy matrix generation. Regarding the spatial distribution of biomass sources, sugarcane prevails on the coast, firewood and livestock manure in the dryland area towards the west, and municipal solid waste is distributed throughout the region within urban areas. Different from what we expected, the potential energy recovery from municipal waste and animal manure would increase by only 17% the current bioenergy supply. In the future, since the majority of the region presents a semi-arid climate with limited rainfall, to increase the use of biomass as an energy source, there is a need to increase the supply of biomass sources with high efficiency in water use and good yields in drylands. For this, the cultivation and use of cacti and agave, for example, could contribute to making biorefineries viable in the region. Above all, public policies for harnessing bioenergy in NE Brazil must seek opportunities associated with the carbon/decarbonization economy, with studies being needed to assess the technical, economic, social, and environmental viability of future productive arrangements.

Increased salinization damages the health and function of soil systems and influences the microbial community structure and function. Some studies have been conducted to reveal the microbial community structure and isolate the microorganisms of saline soil or salt-lake sediments in this region. However, the functions of microorganisms and their response to salinization, i.e., their adaptation strategy to a wide salinization range in arid environments, are less understood. Here, we applied metagenomics technology to investigate the microbial community structure, function, and their relationship with salinization, and discussed the adaptative strategy of microorganisms to different saline environments. A total of 42 samples were sequenced on the Illumina PE500 platform. The archaea and bacteria constituted the dominant kingdoms; Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes were the dominant bacterial phyla; and Euryarchaeota were the dominant archaeal phylum. The microbial communities showed significant structure divergence according to the salt concentration (saline (mean EC 22 mS/cm) and hypersaline (mean EC 70 mS/cm)), wherein the communities were dominated by bacteria in saline soils and archaea in hypersaline soils. Most of the dominant bacterial representation decreased with salinity, while the archaea increased with salinity. KEGG functional annotation showed that at level 2, the cell motility, environmental adaptation, signal transduction, signaling molecules and interaction, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, and metabolism of other amino acids were reduced from saline to hypersaline, whereas the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, folding sorting and degradation, replication and repair, transcription and translation, amino acid biosynthesis, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and carbon fixation increased with salinity. The increased salt content decreased the carbohydrate activities of microorganisms. The osmolyte regulation substance synthesis and absorption-related genes were more abundant in saline soils than in hypersaline soils, whereas the Na+/H+ antiporter genes (mnhB-E) and H+/Na+-transporting ATPase genes (atpA-F, I, K) were significantly higher in hypersaline soils. This indicated that in saline soils, microorganisms primarily synthesize and/or uptake compatible solutes to cope with osmotic stress, whereas in the hypersaline habitat, the high-salt-in strategy was predicated to be adopted by the halophilic/extremely halophilic microorganisms, coupled with a high abundance of replication and repair, cofactors and vitamin metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and carbon fixation to provide energy and ensure cell regeneration. In conclusion, increases in salinity influence the microbial communities' structure and function, as well as the adaptation of microorganisms.					wang, qiang/IZW-1751-2023; Li, Kun/JLL-6505-2023; LI, QI/IUM-8577-2023; Yang, Jianjun/I-2092-2012; Wang, Yahui/JCO-6233-2023; Li, Ye/JBS-2949-2023; li, bai/JNE-1502-2023; Wang, Chao/JHT-6081-2023; Li, bo/IWL-9318-2023	Li, Kun/0000-0002-3638-2974; Li, Yan/0000-0002-7798-6037; Yang, Xiao-Dong/0000-0002-3553-2125; Teng, Dexiong/0000-0001-8742-230X														2076-2607				NOV	2022	10	11							2183	10.3390/microorganisms10112183	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms10112183								36363774					WOS:000895043400001

This research is aimed to assess temporal and spatial trends of 18 climatic and agro-climatic thermal and hydric indices in the north of Argentine Patagonia (39 degrees-44 degrees, south latitude), to establish the current and potential suitability of this region for agriculture in a context of climate change. The period of study was 1970-2016, and it was focused on the last 20 years. Regional warming was indicated by the average increases of annual mean temperature (+ 0.2 degrees C decade(-1)), mean maximum temperature of the warm trimester (+ 0.3 degrees C decade(-1)), and extreme maximum temperature of the warmest month (+ 0.6 degrees C decade(-1)) during 1970-2016. This trend was also found in the 1996-2017 period. Mean minimum temperature of the cold trimester showed an uneven spatial and temporal trend, with increasing temperatures during 1970-2016 (+ 0.1 degrees C decade(-1)), but a negative trend (- 0.1 degrees C decade(-1)) over the last 20 years, which leads to an increasing regional trend in temperature amplitude. Negative trends in extreme minimum temperatures of April (- 0.3 degrees C decade(-1)), July and October (- 0.2 degrees C decade(-1)) imply more significant risks of cold damage for crops that exhibit sensitive phenological stages during this time. Thermal agro-climatic indices showed negative trends in winter chill (- 15.8 chill hours decade(-1)considering the Weinberger method and - 20.8 chill hours decade(-1)using Sharpe method) and higher accumulation of warm semester growing degree days (+ 38.8 GDD(5 degrees C)and + 32.3 GDD(10 degrees C)decade(-1)). Climatic and agro-climatic water indices showed that most of the region experienced decreasing water availability, mainly in the central-south and Andean subregions, showing annual precipitation trends of - 11.5 and - 31.2 mm decade(-1), respectively). If these thermal and hydric trends are maintained in the future, the region will evolve into an area of greater energetic availability but with some restrictions: lower winter chill that would affect very high-chill cultivars cultivated in the warmest regions, higher risk of extreme thermal events during crucial phenological periods of specific crops, and decreasing water availability that would mainly affect dryland farming and river basin recharge.

Particularly in arid and semi-arid regions, those lakes were severely impacted and threatened due to their hydrologic sensitivity and ecological vulnerability. As the largest lake in Northwest China with arid climate, Bosten Lake provides precious water resources and ecosystem services to local communities. Although a large quantity of earlier efforts have been paid on Bosten Lake, there is still absence of tracking its changing trajectory at a long timescale (e.g., one century), which restricts the holistic understanding of the decadal periodic lake desiccations and their driving forces. This study employs a machine learning method to reconstruct the centenary covariations of water storage and salinity of Bosten Lake by integrating multi-source data. The results showed that, compared with the high stage of 6.76 x 10(9) m(3) in 1961, the lake water storage substantially dropped twice to 3.96 x 10(9) m(3) in 1987 and 4.67 x 10(9) m(3) in 2013. In recent years, the lake level rose rapidly and recovered back to the comparable stage of the 1960 s by 2020. Four metrics of accuracy evaluation employed in this study indicate the reliability of the XGBoost model, with the mean absolute error of 0.31 m, mean squared error of 0.37 m, r-square of 0.85, and adjusted r-square of 0.84. The centenary recon-struction results reveal that the lake salinity underwent six-phase fluctuations with the water level and storage changes during 1920-2020, with the highest value of 1.87 g/L in 1987 and the lowest value of 1.19 g/L in 2002. During the past century, the water salinity and storage of Bosten Lake were influenced chiefly by vapor pressure and precipitation, followed by wet day frequency, daily mean temperature, and potential evapotranspiration. Moreover, the uncertainty of the machine learning model was also explored and discussed. It could be mainly associated with the data accuracy of input climate variables and the ignorance of environmental impacts from the intense agricultural activities after the 1960 s. This study is expected to advance the scientific understanding of long-term change characteristics of Bosten Lake and to provide a technical reference of reconstructing cen-tenary hydrologic and environmental trajectory for dryland lakes.

The sporophytic type of fertility restoration in the A<sub>3</sub> CMS-inducing cytoplasm of sorghum and its modification by plant water availability conditions	VAVILOVSKII ZHURNAL GENETIKI I SELEKTSII												The A(3) type of CMS in sorghum is one of the most difficult to restore fertility because of the low frequency of fertility-restoring genes among sorghum accessions, the complex mechanism of fertility restoration that occurs with the complementary interaction of two gametophytic genes Rf3 and Rf4, and the sensitivity of their expression to air and soil drought. In order to test the hypothesis of the sporophytic type of fertility restoration in CMS lines with A(3) type cytoplasm developed in our laboratory, we analyzed segregation in the self-pollinated progeny of fertile F-1 hybrids grown under different water availability conditions (in a dryland plot, in plots with additional irrigation, in a growth chamber, and in an experimental field with a natural precipitation regime) and in their backcrosses to the maternal CMS-line. The presence of sterile plants in the F-2 and BC1 families with the maternal CMS line grown in all tested water availability conditions argues for the sporophytic mechanism of fertility restoration. Cytological analysis of fertile F-1 hybrids revealed a significant amount of degenerating pollen grains (PGs) with impaired starch accumulation and detachment of the PG contents from the cell wall. It is assumed that the expression of the fertility-restoring genes Rf3 and Rf4 in the hybrids with studied CMS lines starts already in the sporophyte tissues, normalizing the development of a certain part of the PGs carrying the recessive alleles of these genes (rf3 and rf4), which are involved in fertilization and give rise to sterile genotypes found in F-2 and BC1 families. For the first time, the transgenerational effect of water availability conditions of growing a fertility-restoring line on male fertility of the F2 generation was detected: a pollinator grown in a plot with additional irrigation produced more fertile and less sterile individuals compared to the same pollinator grown under a rainfall shelter (p < 0.01), and the segregation pattern changed from digenic to monogenic, indicating heritable inhibition of the expression of one of the fertility-restoring genes (kind of "grandfather effect"). The possibility of selection for the stability of the fertility restoration system of the A(3) cytoplasm to functioning under conditions of high vapor pressure deficit during the flowering period was shown. These data may contribute to the creation of effective fertility restoring lines for this type of CMS in sorghum.

Nevertheless, the relative effects of straw and straw-derived biochar application on soil structure, water and fertilizer use efficiency, and yield of maize under drip irrigation are yet to be explored. A 2-year field experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of straw and biochar application on soil bulk density, soil porosity, and hydro-physical properties and to optimize an agronomic strategy for enhancing maize productivity and water and nitrogen utilization efficiency in arid areas. Three straw incorporation methods, (i) no straw incorporation (T), (ii) straw incorporation (S), and (iii) straw-derived biochar application (B), and four nitrogen fertilizer rates, (i) no nitrogen application (N-0), (ii) medium nitrogen (N-225, 225 kg ha(-1)), (iii) traditional nitrogen (N-300, 300 kg ha(-1)), and (iv) high nitrogen (N-375, 375 kg ha(-1)), were used as treatments. Our results indicated that both S and B improved soil structure (soil porosity) and water storage in 0-60 cm soil profile. Compared with T, the average grain yield increased by 3.7-7.1% and 5.8-15.6% under S and B treatments, respectively, while water use efficiency (WUE) was improved by 2.0-13.0% and 6.2-17.5%. Compared to S, B effectively improved the soil structure, soil water consumption from deep layers (80-200 cm), and dry matter accumulation at later growth stage (V12-R6). Nitrogen application significantly enhanced the water consumption in 0-200 cm soil layer and increased straw and grain yield, which increased with increasing the N rates. A positive interactive effect between straw incorporation methods and nitrogen application rates was observed. Under straw-derived biochar application, medium dose of N recorded significantly the highest grain yield (average 13.78 t ha(-1)), WUE (average 21.2 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)), and nitrogen agronomic efficiency (NAE) in comparison with T with traditional N application rate. Straw-derived biochar application with 225 kg ha(-1) N could be an efficient strategy leading to improved water and N use efficiency and productivity of spring maize under drip irrigation. However, due to the high economic input of biochar compared with straw, widespread use of biochar in agriculture still needs more institutional and technical support.

R. Br.] is a staple food crop of arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa. Forty-five pearl millet populations of Asian and African origin were assessed for genetic diversity using 29 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The SSR-based clustering and structure analyses showed that Asian origin-Asian bred (As-As) and African origin-African bred (Af-Af) populations were distributed across seven clusters, indicating no strong relationship among populations with their geographical origin. Most of the African origin-Asian bred (Af-As) populations had a higher average number of alleles per locus than As-As or Af-Af populations, and the majority of them clustered separately from As-As or Af-Af populations, indicating that introgression of African origin breeding materials led to the development of new gene pools adapted to the Asian region. Fourteen populations representing seven clusters were crossed according to a diallel mating design to generate 91 population hybrids (seeds of direct and reciprocal crosses were mixed) and evaluated at three locations in 2016. All the 91 hybrids when partitioned into three groups based on genetic distance (GD) between parental combinations (low, moderate, and high), revealed no correlation between GD and panmictic midparent heterosis in any of the groups, indicating that grain yield heterosis cannot be predicted based on GD. Two population hybrids (GB 8735 x ICMP 87307 and Sudan I x Ugandi) exhibited high levels of yield heterosis over standard checks and can be further utilized using different breeding schemes to develop high-yielding pearl millet cultivars.

J	Stroud, E; Bogaard, A; Charles, M				Stroud, Elizabeth; Bogaard, Amy; Charles, Michael			A stable isotope and functional weed ecology investigation into Chalcolithic cultivation practices in Central Anatolia: Catalhoyuk, Camlibel Tarlasi and Kurucay	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS												The integration of stable isotope analysis of crop remains with the ecological analysis of archaeological weed flora allows for a detailed reconstruction of crop husbandry and arable growing conditions. This paper presents the first such study for developed Neolithic and Chalcolithic Central Anatolia, exploring crop husbandry at the large (8 ha) early 6th millennium BC site of Catalho spacing diaeresis yuk West and the last phases of the preceding Neolithic Catalho spacing diaeresis yuk East, located on the western end of the Konya Plain, and the small 4th millennium sites of Camlibel Tarlasi (0.25 ha), located in the loop of the Kizilirmak river, and Kurucay Ho spacing diaeresis yuk (similar to 1 ha), located on the shore of Lake Burdur. The results reveal the mosaic nature of Catalho spacing diaeresis yuk cultivation; the complex ecosystem, naturally N-15 enriched, was additionally anthropogenically improved, while inhabitants also chose to cultivate barley in drier conditions to the wheats and pulses. The smaller, Late Chalcolithic site of Camlibel Tarlasi cultivated each individual crop species in variable conditions instead of selecting a specific species for cultivation in drier or wetter conditions. Each single species was cultivated in conditions with a wide range of water availabilities while receiving low-level manure application. Variation in water availability is possibly a consequence of the variable topography surrounding the site, with the hills potentially used for cultivation, providing a wide range of conditions due to their slope. Functional weed ecology complements the isotopic data, indicating the wider range of cultivation intensities surrounding Catalho spacing diaeresis yuk West, compared with more consistent, narrower ranges of growing conditions at Camlibel Tarlasi and Kurucay Ho spacing diaeresis yuk. Settlement date, site size and environment seem to be key contributing factors shaping the method used to cultivate crops at these Chalcolithic sites. The larger, earlier community of Catalho spacing diaeresis yuk West, located in a complex riverine ecosystem around the dryland anabranching channels of the Cars , amba river, cultivated species in different conditions and maintained a range of crop husbandry intensities, potentially reflecting differential access to limited resources. The smaller Late Chalcolithic sites, with communities consisting of one household to several households and located in less complex ecosystems with higher precipitation, maintained more stable crop growing conditions and management intensities. This is plausibly a consequence of equal access and sharing of critical resources for crop cultivation, such as labour, manure and land, coupled with the adequate precipitation rates.																			2352-409X					AUG	2021	38								103010	10.1016/j.jasrep.2021.103010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2021.103010		MAY 2021											WOS:000684858100005
J	Wu, B; Li, LD; Xu, L; Li, XL				Wu, Bing; Li, Ludi; Xu, Ling; Li, Xinlu			Modelling sheet erosion on steep slopes of clay loess soil using a rainfall simulator	BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING												The process of sheet erosion has a dramatic influence on the development of soil erosion. To successfully model sheet erosion it is necessary to establish a suitable erosion prediction model for regions with clay loess soil. This study strives to achieve the following: 1) understanding and quantifying sheet erosion patterns caused by different variations of the rainfall intensity, slope steepness, and flow velocity, and 2) evaluate the influence of hydrodynamic parameters on sheet erosion for clay loess soil. A series of simulation experiments of rainfall on clay loess soil were carried out using a range of values of rainfall intensity (54, 78, 102, 126 and 150 mm h(-1)) and gradient (8.7, 17.6, 26.8, 36.4 and 46.6%). The simulation outcomes demonstrated that the rate of sheet erosion followed a power function of rainfall intensity and also gradient with a coefficient of determination R-2 of 0.98 and a NasheSutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.96. The sensitivity of the sheet erosion rate to rainfall intensity was higher than its sensitivity to slope steepness. Furthermore, the sheet erosion rate could be predicted using its power-law dependence on flow velocity with R-2 of 0.88 and NSE of 0.82. The sheet erosion rate was optimally and linearly fitted with the shear stress with R-2 of 0.95 and NSE of 0.95, it was optimally fitted through power functions with either the stream power (with metrics of R-2 of 0.94 and NSE of 0.93) or the unit stream power (with R-2 of 0.74 and NSE of 0.68). Thus stream power represented a reliable predictor of the sheet erosion rate, and the shear stress was the better predictor. By contrast, the unit stream power was found to be a poor predictor of the sheet erosion rate. The findings of this study can help to accurately predict sheet erosion for clay loess soil on steep slopes. (C) 2022 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The south of Morocco is an area of the country well known for its luxury golf courses, even though the region has a dry climate due to low rainfall. Irrigation of its golf courses is a major issue in that region, particularly during the summer. Our goal was to see if the three biochars derived from agricultural wastes could improve the ecophysiological responses of P. vaginatum under adequate water supply and moderate drought stress. The effect of peanut hull biochar on improving the physiological and stomatal traits of seashore paspalum under two water shortages was clearer in the summer season compared to the winter and spring seasons in this study. By releasing carbon and organic matter, the addition of 6% peanut hull biochar to soil improved grass tolerance to soil-moisture stress physiology in the summer season. In fact, due to its ability to retain water, the application of peanut hull biochar to soil could potentially save 47.5% on turfgrass in hot, dry climates. A plastic pot open-air trial was conducted with the Paspalum vaginatum (seashore paspalum) using different rates of biochar or compost addition to sandy loam soil and two water treatments (60% and 20% of the water-holding capacity of the control) during three seasons (winter, spring, and summer). Paspalum growth, physiological characteristics, and physicochemical properties of soil were investigated. The effect of biochar on soil properties was assessed using factor analysis of mixed data (FAMD). Additionally, multiple factorial designs (MFA) were used to examine the impact of three biochars on physiological functions. Peanut hull biochar application increased soil fertility and chlorophyll concentration of paspalum leaves significantly compared to the other biochars. Physiological characteristics were significantly improved with peanut hull biochar under summer compared to winter and spring due to the accumulation of nutrients in the soil by the decomposition of biochar. The application rate of the three biochars reduced the water requirements of paspalum. The best result was obtained by incorporating 6% peanut hull biochar into the soil, which resulted in better soil quality and healthy grass in dryland conditions while using 47.5% less water. These findings can be suitable for golf managers and can serve as a solution for dry zones.

However, due to the lack of efficient mulch film recovery, residual plastic film fragments accumulating in soil nowadays pose a risk to agricultural production sustainability. To mitigate the pollution result from polyethylene (PE) film mulching and demonstrate the relationship between soil microenvironment, photosynthetic capacity, yield, and water use efficiency of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in various mulching practices, a two-year field experiment was carried out to test five mulching practices (sprayable degradable film mulching; biodegradable transparent film with an 80-day induction period mulching; biodegradable transparent film with a 100-day induction period mulching; conventional transparent polyethylene film mulching; no film mulching) in Xinjiang, Northwest China. The results showed that mulching significantly increased soil water content and temperature by 23.83% and 15.01% (average on two years) in topsoil compared to the bare soil surface, associated with a higher plant height, leaf area index, photosynthetic rate and aboveground biomass accumulation. Soil moisture, temperature, and crop height all significantly influenced cotton leaf photosynthetic rate, and soil moisture had the most significant impact (the direct path coefficient was 0.450). The highest cotton yield and WUE were observed in PE film mulching (5480.59 kg ha(-1) and 1.35 kg m(-3), respectively, average on two years) and the biodegradable transparent film with a 100-day induction period was comparable with PE film in yield increased and reduction of water loss (yield and WUE was 5357.51 kg ha(-1) and 1.29 kg m(-3), respectively, average on two years). The sprayable biodegradable film also had good wetting and warming effects on soil, but notably, sprayable film performances were still weaker than that in solid films. Compared to solid degradable films mulching, soil moisture, soil temperature, photosynthetic rate, yield, and WUE in sprayable film mulching was decreased by 5.55%, 7.19%, 31.41%, 5.31%, and 8.58% on average, respectively. In general, biodegradable transparent film with a 100-day induction period could significantly improve soil water-heat status, enhance cotton development, reduce water evaporation, increase cotton yield and WUE, which provides a cotton-cultivation option to control residual PE fragments pollution and maintained cotton yield.

J	Le, TS; Morgenroth, J				Le, Thai Son; Morgenroth, Justin			Strategic expansion of existing forest monitoring plots: a case study using a stratified GIS-based modelling approach	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF FORESTRY SCIENCE												Background: Understanding the relationship between sites and the plant species they support is essential for effective vegetation management. Site-species matching requires knowledge of the growth response of a given species to the full range of environmental conditions in potential planting sites. This can be achieved by repeatedly measuring species growth at a comprehensive network of sample plots that cover a range of environmental conditions, including topography, climate, and soil factors. The New Zealand Dryland Forests Initiative has established permanent sample plots (PSPs) of a plantation species, Eucalyptus bosistoana F.Muell, across New Zealand. However, these PSPs do not cover the entire range of environmental conditions available for the species and hence there is a need to expand the network of sites. The aim of this study was to determine optimal locations for new PSPs to provide more unique information to support site-species matching studies for Eucalyptus bosistoana in New Zealand. Methods: A geographic information system (GIS) and stratified random sampling method were used to generate a model to identify optimal locations for E. bosistoana PSP establishment The variables used in this study included topography, climate, and soil data. Redundancy between the initial set of potential explanatory variables was reduced by a multi-collinearity analysis. The potential habitat for the species was restricted to land with environmental conditions that could support E. bosistoana. AU environmental variables were stratified and an initial priority index for each stratum in each variable was calculated. Then a weighted-overlay analysis was conducted to create the final priority index, which was mapped to identify high-priority areas for targeted PSP expansion. Results: The existing PSP network for E. bosistoana generally covers the environmental conditions in low-elevation New Zealand dry lands, which are located alongside the east coast of the South Island, and the southern part of the North Island. The model identified high priority areas for PSP expansion, including several large regions in the North Island, especially in Rangitikei and Taupo Districts. Conclusions: The model successfully allowed identification of areas for a strategic expansion of permanent sample plots for E. bosistoana. Newly identified areas expand upon the topographic, climatic, and soil conditions represented by the existing PSP network. The new area for PSP expansion has potential to provide valuable information for further site-species matching studies. The methodology in this paper has potential to be used for other plot networks of a different species, or even natural forests.

In this study, we proposed the concept of spatial scene, a geographical unit with a coordinate position, and high uni-fication in social-economic attributes, land cover, ecological function, and externalities, to substitute for the land use/land cover (LULC) in the traditional three-dimensional ecological footprint (EF3D) model, thereby estab-lishing a novel framework for coastal ECC (CECC) assessment. The coastal zone of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) was chosen to examine the applicability and reliability of our framework. Results showed that the CECC estimated by spatial scene in the study area reached 0.1877 gha per capita, totaled 3.99 million gha in 2019, and the scenes of marine capture and forest provided the largest CECC. The per capita ecological footprint size (EFsize), ecological footprint depth (EFdepth), and EF3D reached 0.1684 gha, 14.35, and 2.42 gha, respectively, representing unsustainable development in the GBA coastal zone. The EF3D mainly distributed in scenes of grassland, forest, industrial, marine capture, coastal intertidal and offshore (CIO) port-shipping, traffic station, dryland, and CIO industrial-urban, while only the scenes of services and CIO tourism-entertainment were within CECC and therefore sustainable. Hong Kong, Huizhou, and Dongguan had the largest per capita EF3D. Compared to our results, the CECC and EFsize estimated by the traditional EF3D model were respectively 18% and 6% lower, while their EFdepth and EF3D were respectively 21% and 13% higher, which should be attributed to the significant differences in classification standard and scale between spatial scene and LULC. Our results showed higher correlations and more significant relationships with total gross domestic product (GDP), marine GDP, and main energy EF than those based on the traditional LULC, indicating a better reflection of the economic development status, energy consumption structure, and marine economic develop-ment modes by our framework. It is recommended to accelerate the industrial transformation and upgrading, and strengthen the conservation of ecological, agricultural, and marine space, in order to promote the sustainable development of GBA coastal zone. Our study revealed that our framework is capable of serving as a more effective and accurate method for assessing CECC and sustainability.

To explore the environmental and economic optimal N rate (EEONR) for dryland maize in the hilly areas of southern China, a field experiment was conducted with spring maize from 2015 to 2017. Common urea (CU, control, 240 kg N ha(-1)) and four polymer-coated urea (PCU) fertilization levels (100PCU, 90PCU, 80PCU, 70PCU, which respectively denotes 0, 10%, 20% and 30% reduction of PCU-N application based on the control) were employed in this trial. Maize yield, N loss and economic return were investigated over 3 years. The results were as follows: (1) relative to CU, a 0-20% reduction in the PCU-N application rate did not significantly affect the maize yield during the three consecutive years, however, a 30% reduction in the PCU-N application rate led to significant yield loss in the third year despite the consistent yields achieved in the first 2 years. (2) PCU application significantly abated N loss to the environment, and as N application rate decreased, N loss significantly reduced. Our results showed that a 0-30% reduction in the PCU-N application rate mitigated N loss by 12.8-46.1% via N2O, NH3, runoff and leaching, and the two main N-loss pathways were leaching (55.2-62.2%) and NH3 volatilization (29.8-36.0%). (3) A 0-30% reduction in the PCU-N application rate resulted in a deficit, ranging from 784 to 2438 CNY ha(-1) for increased earnings over CU because of the high purchase price of PCU. The net economic benefit was calculated from the N input cost, yield economic income and environment cost of N lost in the treatments with 0, 10%, 20% and 30% reduction of PCU-N and were - 1820 to 14,479, 402 to 14,612, 2306 to 14,613, and 3941 to 14,205 CNY ha(-1), respectively, and the net economic benefit of the CU plot was - 4003 to 14,671 CNY ha(-1). In summary, our findings suggest that reducing the PCU-N application rate by 20% is a reasonable EEONR for spring maize cultivation in hilly areas of southern China.

The heterogeneity of local aspirations and their implications for development have barely been considered. We explore the aspirations of residents of three contrasting regions in Kenya that vary in their agricultural and off-farm potential. We argue that opportunities are a major framing influence on aspirations but there is important, and routinely overlooked, diversity within the communities which could inform future options for effective development. We outline how development initiatives could be redesigned to align more closely with aspirations. However, aspirations are a complex concept and, while our approach offered novel insights, these would be enriched when combined with household survey data.

In this study, based on experiments conducted in glass soil columns and field under rainout shelters in four years (2012-2016) in Yangling, Shaanxi Province in China, we attempted to establish a dynamic model for simulating leaf expansion and senescence of winter wheat under soil water stress. First, a temperature response function was established with four cardinal temperatures (base temperature, lower optimum temperature, higher optimum temperature, and maximum temperature). Then two soil water stress functions were established to quantify the effect of soil water stress on the processes of leaf expansion and leaf senescence of main stem per plant. The first order derivative of a logistic function was then modified with the temperature and soil water stress response function and was used to simulate the daily rate of leaf area expansion and senescence of main stem. The parameters of the new model were estimated using the Solver add-in in MS Excel and then validated based on the data of soil column experiments in 2014-2015 growing season. Then the new model was evaluated with another dataset of column experiments conducted in 2015-2016. Furthermore, the influence of soil water stress on wheat tillering was included in the new model based on open field experiments in 2012-2013 growing season. Then, the new leaf area index (LAI) simulation model was further verified with the data of open field experiments under rainout shelter (2013-2014) and rainfed condition (2004-2005, 2005-2006, and 2008-2009) in different sites. A comparison was conducted between new LAI model and the original LAI module of CERES-Wheat. The results showed that the leaf expansion rate was not affected when the relative soil water availability was greater than 0.7; water stress inhibited the leaf expansion when relative soil water availability was between 0.2 and 0.7; leaves withered and yellowed when relative soil water availability was less than 0.2. The overall average root mean square error (RMSE) and residual accumulation coefficient (CRM) were 9.78 cm(2) plant(-1), -0.03, and 6.51 cm(2) plant(-1); 0.05 for model calibration and validation, respectively. The RMSE of LAI decreased by an average of 47.89% compared with the original LAI module of CERES-Wheat. The results of this study can help to improve the current CERES-Wheat model for model applications in the arid and semi-arid regions of China.

However, the potential effect of compost on soil aggregate and its nutrient characteristics is still unclear. In view of this, we conducted a greenhouse vegetable cultivation experiment to evaluate soil water-stable aggregate (WSA) and its stability indices and aggregate nutrient stoichiometry characteristics at 0 to 20 cm soil depth with four treatments: (1) no fertilizer (CK), (2) chemical fertilizer (CF), (3) organic fertilizer (OF), and (4) chemical fertilizer plus organic fertilizer (CO). The results showed that the proportion of the 2 to 0.25 mm fraction was the greatest, followed by 0.25 to 0.053 mm, which accounted for 41.83 to 49.53% and 28.60 to 31.88% by weight, respectively. The mean weight diameter (MWD) value and the proportion of the >0.25 mm fraction in the CF, OF, and CO treatments were significantly higher than in the CK treatment. Within the fertilization treatments, the MWD and the proportion of the >0.25 mm fraction in the CO were significantly higher than those in CF and OF. Among all the aggregates, the soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) contents were the highest in the fraction of 0.25 to 0.053 mm. The CF, OF, and CO treatments significantly increased the SOC, TN, and TP contents compared with the CK treatment. The SOC content of fractions >2 mm and 0.25 to 0.053 mm in the CO treatment was significantly higher than that of the CF and OF treatments, and the TN and TP contents in all the aggregates (except < 0.053 mm) were the highest in the CO treatment. The SOC, TN, and TP contents in the 2 to 0.25 mm and 0.25 to 0.053 mm components contributed greatly to the soil SOC, TN, and TP reserves. There was no noticeable difference in the nutrient stoichiometry of the soil aggregate between the different treatments. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that the soil physicochemical factors, including SOC, TN, TP, and pH, significantly explained the stability of the soil aggregate. To summarize, chemical fertilizer combined with organic fertilizer positively affected the stability and nutrient accumulation of soil aggregates in greenhouse dryland.

However, an oat (Avena sativa L.)-common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) intercrop system has not been fully developed in the agro-pastoral ecotone of Inner Mongolia, China. This study evaluated the effects of seven treatments, including five oat-common vetch intercropping patterns, sole oat, and sole vetch on yield and quality performance at different growth periods [75 days after sowing (DAS), 90 DAS, 105 DAS], on the basis of field experiments conducted in the agro-pastoral ecotone of Inner Mongolia in 2015 and 2016. The OV3:1 (oat intercropped with common vetch at seeding ratios 3:1) treatment at 105 DAS in 2016 was superior to other treatments, as it achieved the highest shoot dry matter, increasing by 24.1% and 37.1% compared to sole oat and common vetch. The crude fat (CF) contents, CF yield, and crude protein (CP) yield increased under OV3:1, and acid detergent fiber (ADF) decreased under OV3:1, compared to monoculture. The results indicate that intercropping is an efficient cropping system for the agro-pastoral ecotone of Inner Mongolia. The appropriate proportion of oat and common vetch intercropping at 3:1 and harvesting time not only increases crop yield but also improves the crop quality.

But to what extent this transformation influences soil microbial properties is less known. In our study we compared variations in soil microbial attributes following changes in land-use types to understand the influence of altered soil properties on microbial biomass and their community structure using chloroform fumigation extraction method and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. For this purpose, 3 agricultural (AL) (farmland, apple orchard and 2 years abandoned land) and 4 rehabilitated lands (RL) of various vegetations grassland, shrubland, mixed forest (Amorpha fruticosa and Pinus tabuliformis Carr.) and forest (Robinia pseudoacacia) were selected. Our results showed higher soil organic carbon (SOC) contents in RL soils (forest >mixed forest >grassland>shrub land) than that in AL soils. In RL soils, soil microbial biomass and abundance of group specific PLFA were significantly higher than those in AL soils. Under different land-use types, microbial community was bacteria dominated over fungi. The microbial physiological indices (G(+)/G(-), cyc/prec and S/M) indicated decreased environmental stress in RL soils in comparison with AL soils. In loess soils, SOC and total N correlated positively (p < 0.05) with microbial biomass C, N and P and also with fungal and bacterial PLFA, indicating a positive microbial mediation in improving soil fertility. Taking together, our findings suggest that land rehabilitation, especially Robinia pseudoacacia planation, improves overall edaphic conditions and accelerates soil microbial biomass accumulation in local regions.

Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is an important staple grain legume source of good quality dietary protein around the world, particularly in southern Asia, northern Africa, and the Middle East. In the present investigation, the genetic variability for protein and mineral concentrations was studied in 41 accessions of cultivated chickpea and eight annual wild Cicer species of primary, secondary, and tertiary gene pool. Large variability was observed between and within Cicer species for seed protein, Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, Ca, and Mg concentration with high heritability. C. chorassanicum (Bunge) Popov was found to be the most promising species for high seed protein and Ca; C. judaicum Boiss. for high seed Fe, Cu. and Mg; C. yamashiatae Kitam. for high seed Zn and Fe; and C. pinnatifidum Jaub. & Spach for high seed Mn concentrations. All the wild Cicer accessions except ICC20190 (C. echinospermum P. H. Davis) had high concentration of at least one or more seed nutrients. Wild Cicer accessions such as ICC17141 (C. chorassanicum), ICC17269 and ICC17303 (both C. pinnatifidum), ICC17261 and ICC17262 (C. reticulatum), ICC20236 (C. chorassanicum), and ICC17117 and ICC17281 (C. yamashitae) were found promising for multiple seed nutrients. As C. reticulatum Ladiz. and C. echinospremum accessions are crossable with cultivated chickpea, promising C. reticulatum accessions identified in the present study can be used in crossing program for developing new nutrient-rich chickpea cultivars.

Findings indicate that although smallholders with smaller landholdings are more vulnerable to climatic risk (drought, in our case), they are also more resilient than their counterparts. Results reveal that cropping intensity and crop risk increase the vulnerability of smallholders to climatic risk, but large farms are less vulnerable. Diversification in on-farm enterprises, like livestock units, and off-farm income sources, play significant roles in increasing smallholder households' resilience to climatic risk. Other drivers of resiliency include the choice of cash and risky crops, borrowing capacity, liquid investments, and the ability to regain yields.

However, the poor linking between traditional wastewater treatment and algal cultivation limits the achievement of this goal. In this study, a novel combination of Fenton oxidation and algal cultivation (CFOAC) system was investigated for the treatment of chicken farm flushing wastewater (CFFW). Fenton oxidation (FO) was adopted to reduce the excessive ammonia nitrogen, which might inhibit the algal growth. The results showed that single FO pretreatment removed 70.5 %, 96.7 %, 86.1 %, and 96.2 % of TN, TAN, TP, and COD, respectively. The highest biomass (235.8 mg/L/d) and lipid (77.3 mg/L/d) productivities were achieved on optimized CFOAC system after 7 days batch cultivation. Accordingly, the nutrients removal efficiencies increased to almost 100 %. Further fatty acid profile analysis showed that algae grown on optimal CFOAC system accumulated a high level of total lipids (32.8 %) with C16-C18 fatty acid as the most abundant compositions (accounting for over 60.6 %), which were propitious to biodiesel production. In addition, this CFOAC system was magnified from 1 L flask to 50 L horizontal pipe photobioreactor (HPPB) in semi continuously culture under optimal conditions. The average biomass and lipid productivities were 995.7 mg/L/d and 320.6 mg/L/d, respectively, when cultured at 6 days hydraulic retention time with 1/3 substitution every two days. These findings proved that the novel CFOAC system is efficient in nutrients removal, algal cultivation, and biomass production for advanced treatment of CFFW.

However, few studies comprehensively evaluated its performance on the utilization of water and carbon resources and its environmental impact, as well as the net ecosystem economic benefits (NEEB).Methods: In a semi-humid region, a field trial (2019-2021) was conducted to compare the effects of nitrogen fertilization at 5 (conventional surface fertilization, D5), 15 (D15), 25 (D25) and 35 cm depth (D35), and combined various precipitation year types of dry year, normal year and wet year with precipitation amount of 125 mm, 200 mm and 275 mm on the water and carbon footprints, as well as NEEB during the winter wheat growth.Results: Our results showed that deep fertilizer application significantly reduced the direct greenhouse gas emissions by 6.2-41.6% (p<0.05). During the dry and normal years, deep fertilization (D15, D25, and D35) significantly increased NEEB and yield by 5.6-32.5% and 1.0-25.1%, and yield-scaled carbon footprint (CFyield) significantly reduced by 5.0-33.9% compared with D5 (p<0.05). The water footprint (WF) under D15 and D25 in the dry and normal years significantly decreased by 8.0-12.4% than D5, and D35 significantly reduced by 14.2% compared with D5 under dry year (p<0.05), while increased by 0.6% under normal year. The yield under D25 and D35 decreased by 7.9-11.8% compared with D5 in the wet year, resulting in significant increases in CFyield (6.2-9.8%) and WF (7.6-10.7%), respectively, and NEEB reduced by 12.4-17.6% (p<0.05). D15 still obtained higher yield, where CFyield and WF decreased by 1.6% and 0.3%, respectively, and NEEB increased by 1.6% (p<0.05).Conclusions: Carbon and water footprints reduction, NEEB improvement could be achieved primarily through deep fertilizer application at 34, 25, and 14 cm depth in dry, normal, and wet year, respectively.Implications or significance: Suitable deep fertilizer application is a promising technology for sustainable wheat production through improved wheat production, water and carbon resource utilization, and potential environmental benefits in the semi-humid regions.																			0378-4290	1872-6852				NOV 1	2023	303								109142	10.1016/j.fcr.2023.109142	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2023.109142													WOS:001099057500001

We quantified spatiotemporal variations in SOC in three typical regions (Shuyang, Rugao, and Shanghai) in southeastern China during 1981-2011, by using geographically weighted regression (GWR), and explored the drivers with a geographical detector method. A total of 219 topsoil samples were collected in the three regions to measure the SOC in 2011, and a total of 109 SOC data for 1981 were obtained from the soil survey reports of Shuyang, Rugao, and Shanghai, which involved in the database of the second national soil survey of China. The results showed that the mean SOC contents in 2011 were 14.68 g kg(-1), 9.55 g kg(-1), and 18.00 g kg(-1) in Shuyang, Rugao, and Shanghai, respectively. The topography (q = 0.60) and the sand content of the soil (q = 0.70) were the main drivers of the spatial variability in the SOC in Shuyang and Rugao, while the carbon inputs (q = 0.68) predominantly explained the spatial heterogeneity of the SOC in Shanghai. Significant increases in SOC storage occurred in Shuyang and Rugao from 1981 to 2011, with increase rates of 0.55 t ha(-1) yr(-1) and 0.26 t ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Land use change (dryland farming to rice cultivation) was identified as the largest driver of the SOC increases in Shuyang and Rugao (q values of 0.16 and 0.09, respectively), followed by increasing carbon inputs (0.14 and 0.07). However, the SOC storage in Shanghai rapidly decreased at a rate of -0.38 t ha(-1) yr(-1) during 1981-2011. The land use change from wetlands to rice cultivation was the primary reason for the decreasing SOC (q = 0.24), and a net decrease in carbon inputs between 1981 and 2011 was another main driver of the reduction in the SOC in Shanghai (q = 0.14). Our results from this study provide important information on the spatiotemporal changes in SOC and its drivers to the scientific community and decision-makers, for the development of management strategies to sustain soil fertility in many areas with rapid economic development and increasing populations.

R. Br.]	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Pearl millet is an important cereal crop of semi-arid regions since it is highly nutritious and climate resilient. However, pearl millet is underutilized commercially due to the rapid onset of hydrolytic rancidity of seed lipids post-milling. We investigated the underlying biochemical and molecular mechanisms of rancidity development in the flour from contrasting inbred lines under accelerated aging conditions. The breakdown of storage lipids (triacylglycerols; TAG) was accompanied by free fatty acid accumulation over the time course for all lines. The high rancidity tines had the highest amount of FFA by day 21, suggesting that TAG lipases may be the cause of rancidity. Additionally, the high rancidity tines manifested substantial amounts of volatile aldehyde compounds, which are characteristic products of lipid oxidation. Lipases with expression in seed post-milling were sequenced from low and high rancidity lines. Polymorphisms were identified in two TAG lipase genes (PgTAGLip1 and PgTAGLip2) from the low rancidity tine. Expression in a yeast model system confirmed these mutants were non-functional. We provide a direct mechanism to alleviate rancidity in pearl millet flour by identifying mutations in key TAG lipase genes that are associated with tow rancidity. These genetic variations can be exploited through molecular breeding or precision genome technologies to develop elite pearl millet cultivars with improved flour shelf life.

The barley cultivar Ma'anit and the wheat cultivar Omer were grown by dryland farming (210 mm precipitation) in a commercial field with sandy loam soil. The two cultivars were harvested simultaneously for silage or hay at a similar dry matter (DM) content (35.6%). Barley yields exceeded wheat yields by 19% (5.68 vs. 4.79 t DM/ha, P = 0.01). Two-thirds of each crop's DM yield was chopped and transferred for direct ensiling in polyethylene-wrapped bales, and one-third was wilted in the field for 2 weeks and then pressed into hay bales. The chemical composition and in-vitro DM digestibility of the wheat and barley silages and hays were similar. The two experimental TMRs contained either barley silage (280 g/kg DM) and hay (60 g/kg DM) or similar contents of wheat silage and hay, as the sole source of roughage. High-yielding multiparous Israeli Holstein cows were paired into two experimental groups of 21 cows each and fed either wheat- or barley-based TMR ad libitum for 28 days. DM intake of cows fed the wheat TMR was higher than that of the barley TMR-fed cows (28.0 vs. 27.5 kg/day) due to a faster eating rate (137.9 vs. 132.9 g DM/min) and larger meal size. Energy corrected milk production was similar in the two groups (42.4 and 42.8 kg/day), while milk fat yield was higher in barley-fed cows than wheat-fed cows (1.62 vs. 1.57 kg/day). Daily rumination time of the barley-fed cows was longer (577 vs. 537 min/day) and their rumen pH higher during the day and night (P < 0.01) compared to wheat-fed cows. Consequently, in-vivo DM digestibility and neutral detergent fiber digestibility were higher in the barley-fed cows. Our results thus show the benefit of barley as an alternative forage crop to wheat in semiarid regions, and its advantage as a substitute for wheat as silage and hay for high-yielding lactating cows' TMR.

Moreover, due to the increase of water withdrawals upstream, the Limpopo River is no longer perennial in Mozambique. Fortunately, its river bed can store significant amounts of freshwater, because of the occurrence of thick and often coarse sand deposits formed through pronounced dryland weathering, erosion, and sedimentation in the river channel. Such so-called "sand rivers" exist in many parts of semi-arid Africa and have varying configurations and hydrological conditions. The current research aims to comparatively assess the Limpopo sand river aquifer in terms of recharge and discharge dynamics, storage potential, and interactions with the surface water flow, as a function of its specific hydrological conditions: its large size, location downstream of a dam releasing permanent ecological flow, and its relatively undeveloped state. For this purpose field investigations were carried out at two sites, involving groundwater level measurements, 2D geoelectrical surveying, water chemical and stable isotope analysis, and sediment classification. These investigations reveal the occurrence of medium to coarse sands with thicknesses that can reach 10-15 m, dropping to 2-5 m in the main river channel, underlain by less permeable clays and silts. Analysis of the river level shows that large parts of the sand river are flooded almost every year, providing optimal conditions for recurring and rapid recharge of the system (confirmed by infiltration tests) through two mechanisms: direct infiltration of surface runoff and lateral flow toward non-flooded areas of the river valley, also confirmed by the chemical and isotope study. During the dry season, groundwater provides base flow to the river and the average water level drop in the sand river system is about 1.8 m. The connectivity with the river margins is limited, due to the clayey nature of the river bank sediment, but local paleochannels can result in a continuation of sand layers. Hydrological processes controlling the water quality are evapoconcentration, mixing of discharging groundwater with the perennial surface water flow, and to a minor extent mineral dissolution, with the groundwater being of Ca-HCO3 type. The combination of the large size, high permeability, and frequent flooding of the sand river deposits provides optimal conditions for groundwater abstraction, requiring additional assessment of the impact on riparian vegetation and downstream users.

To understand the effects of climate change on ecosystems, a framework for the selection of indicators based on the essential biodiversity variables (EBV) was proposed. In this framework, a functional approach has been suggested because functional traits have shown to be sensitive to smallscale environmental changes. Additionally, functional traits are also associated with ecosystem-limiting processes. In this context, we used ants as ecological indicators, as they are functionally important and respond in a measurable way to environmental changes. We identify which biodiversity-based indicators (e.g., taxonomic, single-trait and multi-trait indices) help track changes in Mediterranean drylands; for this, we used a space-for-time substitution climatic gradient in the western Mediterranean. Ants were sampled along an aridity gradient and identified to species level. Four continuous and seven categorical traits were measured or retrieved from literature. Continuous traits included Weber's length, which is indicative for body length, head length, eye length and femur length; categorical traits were diet, behavioral dominance, daily activity, nest preference, mound presence, worker polymorphism and foraging strategy. We calculated taxonomic, functional structure and single- and multi-trait functional diversity indices and correlated them with aridity. We found that ant taxonomic and multi-trait functional diversity were maintained along the aridity gradient. Despite maintenance of species and functional diversity along the gradient, ant functional structure responded to aridity with increases in mean trait values of Weber's length, eye length and femur length in the drier part of the gradient. Under wetter conditions, we found the highest proportion of ants with a seed-based diet, reflecting a potential increase in resource quantity. We observed a change in foraging strategy from group to individual as aridity increased. In conclusion, with a space-for-time substitution climatic gradient, this study shows the potential role of aridity as an environmental driver of ant trait values. These results highlight the value of ants and functional traits as indicators to track the effects of climate change on ecosystems. Finally, this study represents a starting point to monitor important species traits in the context of EBV and to use them as indicators to track the effects of aridity on Mediterranean dryland ecosystems.

The proto-Paratethys has now retreated to the present-day Mediterranean, but this huge epicontinental sea once extended eastward to the remote Tarim Basin in Central Asia. Although the Tarim and Tajik Basins are today separated by the Pamir salient, they were once the same basin occupied by sea water that belonged to the easternmost part of the Turan Sea in the early Cenozoic. The present Alay Valley that is situated between the Pamirs and Tian Shan was formerly the seawater channel that connected the Tarim and Tajik Basins; since the late Eocene the Valley has experienced a major change in altitude from sea level to 3500 m. The timing and detailed process of the final seawater retreat in the Alay Valley have considerable importance for understanding the interplay between tectonics, surface process, and climate. However, there is still much controversy about the timing of the final seawater retreat from the Tarim and Tajik Basins. In this paper we present a multidisciplinary study of Upper Paleogene strata in the easternmost Alay Valley. Our new magnetostratigraphy, together with the biostratigraphy and the U-Pb age of detrital zircons, indicates that the Upper Paleogene strata have an age range of 40 to 28 Ma. A shallow open sea ended at 40 Ma in both the Tarim and Tajik Basins just after the termination of the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum. The change from a shallow open sea to an alternative deposition of restricted marine and continental facies began at 40 Ma. Nine marine transgression/regression cycles were recorded in the Alay Valley as indicated by the alternations between restricted marine environment (lagoon) and terrestrial deposition from 39.1 to 37.8 Ma. During this period, the Alay Valley was intermittently occupied by seawater. The final seawater retreat from the Alay Valley was at 37.8 Ma. There might be a diachronous final seawater retreat from the restricted marine environment in the Alay Valley and the Tajik Basin, it was mostly related to the sedimentary hiatuses and/or to the differential uplift and basin filling processes driven by the outward growth of the Pamirs.

The alpine sandy land ecosystem is fragile, where biological soil crusts develop widely on the soil surface and play a critical role in regulating surface hydrological processes. Yet, the effects of biological soil crusts on non-rainfall water in the alpine sandy land remain unclear. Therefore, we investigated the patterns and main sources of non-rainfall water under different biological soil crusts in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region during the growing season (May-September 2017). Micro-lysimeters were used to measure the amount of nonrainfall water in surface soil (0-10 cm) covered with moss and algae crusts in an interdune area. The results revealed that non-rainfall water occurred for at least 12 h center dot d(-1) (7 p.m.-7 a.m.) and disappeared for 5 h (7 a.m.-12 a.m.). The daily mean non-rainfall water amount ranged between 0.324 and 0.426 mm. Differences in the physical and chemical properties of surface soil caused by biological soil crusts affected the accumulation and dissipation of non-rainfall water. The accumulation and dissipation rates of non-rainfall water under biological soil crusts were respectively 1.22-1.32-fold (F = 8.01, P < 0.05) and 1.21-1.27-fold (F = 8.86, P < 0.05) higher than those of bare sand. Biological soil crusts also increased the amount of total non-rainfall water by 23.41%30.39% (F = 5.367, P < 0.05), accounting for 2.4%-3.0% of the total water input. Atmospheric vapor condensation was the principal source of non-rainfall water (>60%). Nevertheless, biological soil crusts increased both atmospheric and soil vapor condensation by 29.44%-39.98% (F = 12.45, P < 0.05) and 13.09-13.94% (F = 5.91, P < 0.05), respectively. Although non-rainfall water contributed only 10%-15% of the total water input, it constituted a main water input to the ecosystem during the dry period of less rainfall (up to 20%, 19.72 vs. 95.72 mm). In conclusion, non-rainfall water, especially atmospheric vapor condensation, makes a non-negligible contribution to water input in the alpine sandy land ecosystem, for which biological soil crusts enhance the role of non-rainfall water in the water input in surface soil water balance dynamics.

R. Br.] is one of the world's hardiest warm-season cereal crop and is cultivated mainly in the semi-arid tropics of Asia and Africa for food, feed, fodder, and brewing. It is mainly cultivated for its gluten-free grains with high content and better quality of nutrients. Pearl millet is a resilient crop that can produce grain and biomass under harsh conditions like low fertility, erratic rainfall, acidic and saline soils, and the hottest climates. However, biotic stresses such as downy mildew and blast diseases and abiotic stresses, especially drought and seedling- and flowering-stage heat stress, pose constant threat to the realization of yield potential of this crop. To make further improvement in threshold level of abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, breeders are looking for novel genes in diverse germplasm sources. Crop wild relatives (CWRs) could be a source of novel genes that are important for diversification of the genetic base of pearl millet. A stage-gate process is proposed for the efficient management of prebreeding programs using CWRs as a source of germplasm diversity and improvement. This article explains the various strategies for capturing and using alleles for climate resilience traits improvement. This article covers breeders' perspectives on importance of using CWRs as germplasm source for crop improvement. This article also describes the availability of CWRs, characterization of new traits and the strategies to be applied for the identification and introduction of genes of interest in elite breeding lines and commercial varieties and hybrids of pearl millet.

Nevertheless, how these measures affect sediment transport at the catchment scale remains unclear. This study coupled an index of connectivity (IC) with the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model to estimate the sediment yield in the Yanhe catchment (7,725 km(2) ). The model was used to assess the impacts of land use changes and check dam construction on sediment delivery. The land use maps showed increasing grassland (10.3%) and decreasing arable land (12.3%) from 1990 to 2010. The ranges of IC between the two land use scenarios showed significant changes with an average of 0.3 in 1990 and -0.5 in 2010. Land use changes resulted in average sediment delivery ratio decreasing from 0.39 in 1990 to 0.30 in 2010. The model was calibrated by annual sediment load at a gauging station, covering 5,852 km(2) of the catchment and by sedimentation rates behind check dams in a representative sub-catchment. Measured and simulated sediment load showed consistent agreement, suggesting acceptable model performance. An approximately 60.7% reduction in sediment yield was attributed to land use changes and increasing check dams' construction from 1990 to 2010. This study provided a good example of combining the IC with a soil erosion model to identify spatial patterns and temporal variations in sediment yield due to soil conservation measures.					; Gao, Peng/K-7487-2014	Zhao, Guangju/0000-0001-7756-4494; Zhao, Guangju/0000-0002-4233-9403; Gao, Peng/0000-0002-4723-4256													0341-8162	1872-6887				FEB	2020	185								104284	10.1016/j.catena.2019.104284	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2019.104284													WOS:000504504500024

Reducing farming system emissions via spatial application of payoff functions	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												CONTEXT: Government and industry policy in Australia requires Australian agriculture to lessen or offset its emissions over coming decades.OBJECTIVE: This study generates response or payoff functions to identify where cost-effective reduction of emissions via agricultural land use change is most feasible.METHODS: Time series bioeconomic modelling is used to examine the profitability and greenhouse gas emissions of land use sequences at a range of locations across the agricultural region of south-western Australia, a major agricultural region of Australia.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Modelling reveals crop dominant land use sequences are most profitable in the northern parts of the study region, whereas in southerly parts of the region, land sequences dominated by pasture-based sheep production are most profitable. However, at a handful of locations, many affected by frost, no strong profit preference for either crop or pasture dominant land use sequences is apparent. Most southerly locations generate high rates of scope 1 emissions for each additional percentage increase in land use allocated to pasture production. By contrast, in northerly or drier environments, rates of scope 1 emissions for additional land allocations to pasture are often under half those observed in higher rainfall southerly loca-tions. Lessening emissions by reducing land use for sheep production is most feasible in the northern parts of the region where land use sequences favour cropping. Further emphasis on cropping in land use sequences, however, will increase farmers' variability of returns.In locations where no strong profit preference for either crop or pasture dominant land use sequences occurs, then small financial incentives or creation of media and social campaigns to support lower emission land use sequences may be sufficient to trigger environmentally beneficial land use change. Modelling results reveal priority actions for research and innovation. Manufacturing low emission fertilisers is a priority for cropping enterprises and will greatly assist emission reductions, especially in the crop dominant land use sequences in the northern and drier parts of the region. Varietal improvement and creation of anti-methanogenic feeds or technologies to capture in situ methane released by grazing or enclosed sheep flocks are investment priorities for locations in the higher rainfall, more southerly parts of the region.SIGNIFICANCE: This study highlights the important role that land use change and creation of emission-reducing technologies and innovations will need to play if agricultural emission reduction is to occur in dryland agriculture.					d'Abbadie, Christophe/ITV-0656-2023	d'Abbadie, Christophe/0000-0001-5960-5790; Kingwell, Ross/0000-0003-0324-9488; Abadi Ghadim, Amir/0009-0000-3164-7884													0308-521X	1873-2267				DEC	2022	203								103534	10.1016/j.agsy.2022.103534	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2022.103534		OCT 2022											WOS:000886547600003

However, due to the spatial heterogeneity and interactive influences of various factors, quantifying the contributions of driving forces on vegetation change remains challenging. In this study, using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy of vegetation growth status and coverage, we analyzed the temporal and spatial characteristics of the NDVI in China's Inner Mongolian grasslands using Theil-Sen slope statistics and Mann-Kendall trend test methods. In addition, using the GeoDetector method, a spatially-based statistical technique, we assessed the individual and interactive influences of natural factors and human activities on vegetation-NDVI change. The results show that the growing season average NDVI exhibited a fluctuating upward trend of 0.003 per year from 2000 to 2018. The areas with significant increases in NDVI (p < 0.05) accounted for 45.63% of the entire region, and they were mainly distributed in the eastern part of the Mu Us sandy land and the eastern areas of the Greater Khingan Range. The regions with a decline in the NDVI were mainly distributed in the central and western regions of the study area. The GeoDetector results revealed that both natural and human factors had significant impacts on changes in the NDVI (p < 0.001). Precipitation, livestock density, wind speed, and population density were the dominant factors affecting NDVI changes in the Inner Mongolian grasslands, explaining more than 15% of the variability, while the contributions of the two topography factors (terrain slope and slope aspect) were relatively low (less than 2%). Furthermore, NDVI changes responded to the changes in the level of specific influencing factors in a nonlinear way, and the interaction of two factors enhanced the effect of each singular factor. The interaction between precipitation and temperature was the highest among all factors, accounting for 39.3% of NDVI variations. Findings from our study may aid policymakers in better understanding the relative importance of various factors and the impacts of the interactions between factors on vegetation change, which has important implications for preventing and mitigating land degradation and achieving sustainable pasture use in dryland ecosystems.					wang, xu/IAN-4886-2023; yuan, liping/JPK-7584-2023; Wang, lili/IXD-9828-2023; lu, yang/IWE-3635-2023; Lyu, Xin/AAM-8304-2021; liu, jiaming/IWE-3196-2023; Wang, Yining/JQW-2010-2023; wang, yu/IUQ-6654-2023; li, xiao/HJP-5134-2023; li, wei/IUQ-2973-2023; li, xiao/HKV-8405-2023; li, xiao/GSN-6181-2022; li, yang/IQV-3559-2023; liang, liang/IAO-8518-2023; LI, XIAO/IQV-9318-2023; LI, XIAO/JCE-6169-2023; Li, Ly/JCD-4746-2023; wang, wei/JBS-7400-2023; li, xiaofeng/GXF-9442-2022	Lyu, Xin/0000-0002-5344-8736; 														2072-4292				JUL	2022	14	14							3320	10.3390/rs14143320	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14143320													WOS:000833628400001

Cover Crop Management on the Southern High Plains: Impacts on Crop Productivity and Soil Water Depletion	ANIMALS												Simple Summary Agriculture throughout the Southern High Plains of the United States relies on supplemental irrigation from the Ogallala Aquifer because of limited precipitation and high evapotranspiration rates. Unfortunately, extraction rates greatly exceed the recharge rate of the aquifer. This region is prone to soil erosion, so maintaining soil coverage is critical for protecting soil resources. Despite the many benefits of planting cover crops, producers do not readily plant winter crops in the Southern High Plains due to concerns of depleting soil water availability for subsequent summer crops. Based on the results of this experiment, producers can plant rye with a no-till drill to help maintain soil cover and produce high-quality winter forage for grazing livestock without threatening soil water supply for the summer crops; in this case, teff. Light irrigation (up to 25 mm per month) should be applied to supplement rainfall and ensure grazing if the producer is reliant upon the rye and does not have other forage available for contingency. Finally, timely termination of the cover crops is critical. Delayed termination of the cover crops was the biggest factor found to reduce the productivity of the teff. The imminent depletion of the Ogallala Aquifer demands innovative cropping alternatives. Even though the benefits of cover crops are well recognized, adoption has been slow in the Southern High Plains (SHP) of the United States because of concerns that cover crops withdraw soil water to the detriment of the summer crops. This small plot experiment tested the interacting effects-production, soil water depletion of the cover crops, and subsequent teff [Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter] summer hay crops-of irrigation and tillage management with five cover crop types to identify low-risk cover crop practices in the drought-prone SHP. Dryland rye (Secale cereale L.) produced modest forage biomass (>1000 kg ha(-1)), even in a dry year, but it was found that light irrigation should be used to ensure adequate forage supply (>1200 kg ha(-1)) if winter grazing is desired. No-till management and timely termination of the winter cover crops were crucial to reducing the negative impact of winter crops on summer teff production. The results indicated no detriment to soil water content that was attributable to planting no-till cover crops compared with the conventional practice of winter fallow. Therefore, producers could take advantage of the soil-conserving attributes of high-quality winter forage cover crops without experiencing significant soil water depletion.																			2076-2615					JAN	2021	11	1							212	10.3390/ani11010212	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani11010212								33467147					WOS:000609643100001

The Challenges of Community-Based Natural Resource Management in Pastoral Rangelands	SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES												Recognizing that community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) approaches have had mixed success in pastoral rangelands, this paper compares five case studies-two from Kenya, two from Ethiopia and one from Tunisia-to identify aspects of social-ecological context that affect the implementation and success of CBNRM in pastoral settings. Data for each case was collected following a common protocol. Among the characteristics that emerged from our study as important were socio-political and biophysical characteristics of the wider landscape within which the community's rangeland territory is located and the extent to which that territory is circumscribed by some combination of other land uses and land tenure types, major political boundaries, and physical landscape features. The analysis of these cases suggests that where pastoralist communities coexist in large, open rangeland landscapes, rather than a narrowly community-based approach, natural resource management interventions need to be explicitly multi-level and horizontally flexible.

AND THEIR MODEL ESTABLISHMENT BASED ON ACCUMULATED TEMPERATURE	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The dynamic relationship between unfolding leaves and active accumulated temperature (AAT) of different maize (Zea mays L.) varieties was studied under different sowing dates, which would provide a theoretical basis for the realization of the informatization and digitalization of maize production on the Loess Plateau of China Results showed that as the number of unfolded leaves increased, the number of days and the required active accumulated temperature to unfold one leaf showed a single peak trend. The unfolding of the 1st and the last leaves need the least time and AAT, while the 8th -15th leaves need the most. With the delay of sowing date, the peak value of the variation trend of the days and active accumulated temperature to unfold one leaf basically decreased gradually. Among different fitting models, the 3rd degree polynomial fitting model y = a + bx + cx(2) + dx(3) may have better biological significance and was thus adopted. As a result, the established models showed great variations in c and d parameters for different varieties, a and c for different sowing dates. The model was tested and showed that the simulated values were in good agreement with the actual values. The above results can provide valuable reference for the quantitative leaf unfolding and AAT requirement for maize and its adaptation to climate change.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2022	20	3					2457	2470		10.15666/aeer/2003_24572470	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/2003_24572470		MAR 2022											WOS:000806266600001

However, the heavy rainfall event in July 2018 triggered many instances of a unique type of loess landslides (i.e., slide-flows) on the gully-slopes with vegetation recovery in the Nanxiaohegou Basin on the Loess Plateau. This rainfall event was unusual and was a persistent heavy rainfall. The accumulated rainfall from 24 June to 10 July was 232.2 mm, which comprised 42% of the mean annual rainfall. A loess slide-flow is characterized by combining two movement types of the slide and flow. The loess slide-flows first slide on the gully-slopes and then turn into long run-out earthflows moving downstream, delivering vast amounts of sediment to the river. The average landslide erosion rates were 110.8-134.9 kg/m2. These loess slide-flows generally did not occur individually but in groups, which were characterized by large numbers, high density, small scale, and shallow depth. The changes of vegetation characteristics and soil characteristics both had a significant impact on the scale of the landslides. Grass with high coverage had an adverse effect on the occurrence of shallow landslides. The adverse hydrological effects of the plant may offset the weak root reinforcement. Loess slide-flows have become a new geological hazard and erosion process on the Loess Plateau. Loess slide-flows are a prominent ecological and environmental problem after vegetation restoration, and more attention should be paid to loess slide-flows in the future.

However, the long-term adoption of a single tillage method may have some adverse effects on soil and ecological environment, although crop yields have increased. Through informed allocation of soil tillage techniques, the combination and configuration of soil tillage measures, such as rotary tillage, subsoiling, and no tillage may reduce the shortcomings of traditional long-term farming. To explore the long-term production mode suitable for production of maize in the loess dryland area, a long-term experiment was conducted in Fuping County, Shaanxi Province, from 2013 to 2018. Six farming modes were used in the experiment: no tillage/subsoiling (N <-> S), subsoiling/rotary tillage (S <-> R), rotary tillage/no tillage (R <-> N), continuous no tillage (N <-> N), continuous subsoiling (S <-> S), and continuous rotary tillage (R <-> R). The changes in soil physical and chemical properties, soil water use patterns, soil water storage, conservation effects during the fallow and growth period, and the effects on farmland yield increase were analyzed. The results showed that rotary tillage can effectively improved soil structure and reduced soil bulk density, where N <-> S treatment soil bulk density is low and in 0-60 cm soil layer averaged 1.31 g/cm(3). Different tillage treatments could be used during the fallow period to store additional soil moisture: the N <-> S treatment showed good water storage effect. Compared to traditional tillage, different tillage methods provided better soil moisture conditions for crops during the growth period, where N <-> S treatment showed good soil moisture status during the growth period of spring maize. Among all the treatments, N <-> S treatment effectively increased the organic carbon storage in the 0-60 cm soil layer, which was 54.3 t/hm(2). Compared with traditional tillage, different tillage treatments effectively increased plant height and dry matter accumulation of spring maize, where N <-> S treatment was found to be the best. Compared with the traditional rotary tillage model, the N <-> S treatment significantly increased crop yield and water use efficiency (WUE) in continuous cropping fields of corn, the average yield of spring corn was 9340.2 kg/hm(2), and the average WUE was 22.9 kg/(hm(2).mm). In summary, for long-term sustainable development, the N <-> S model is the best rotational tillage mode for continuous maize cropping in loess soil.

Groundwater Quality Assessment Using Multi-Criteria GIS Modeling in Drylands: A Case Study at El-Farafra Oasis, Egyptian Western Desert	WATER												The most critical issue that was the main research interest is its groundwater quality which is vital for public health concerns. Groundwater is a significant worldwide water supply for diverse communities, especially in dryland regions. Groundwater quality assessment in desert systems is largely hindered by the lack of hydrological data and the remote location of desert Oases. This study provides a preliminary understanding of the influences of climate, land usage, and population growth on the groundwater quality in El-Farafra Oasis in the Western Desert in Egypt from 2000 to now. Therefore, the study's main objective was to determine the extent of change in temporal water quality and the factors causing it. The present study integrates chemical analyses and geospatial modeling better to assess groundwater quality in the study area. A chemical analysis of thirty-one groundwater samples from wells representing each study area was carried out during three time periods (2000, 2010, and 2022). Several chemical properties of groundwater samples gathered from wells in the research area were analyzed. Furthermore, the groundwater quality trend from 2000 to the present was identified using three approaches: Wilcox and Schoeller Diagram in Aq.QA software, interpolation in the ArcGIS software, and Ground Water Quality Index (GWQI). Moreover, the influence of changing land usage on groundwater quality was studied, and it was found that the increase in agriculture and urbanization areas is linked to groundwater quality degradation. The findings revealed that the barren area in 2000, 2010, and 2022 was 371.7, 362.0, and 343.2 km(2), respectively, which indicates a substantial decrease of 6.2% within this research timeframe. In contrast, agriculture and human-made structures have expanded by 1.8%. Also, population growth has led to an increase in water consumption as the population has grown at a rate of 7.52% annually from 2000 to 2020. As the climatic condition increases from 2000 to 2022, these changes could extend to the water quality in shallow aquifers with increasing evaporation. Based on the water quality spatial model, it is found that, despite a declining tendency in the rate of precipitation and an expansion in agricultural areas and population growth, the water quality was still appropriate for human and farming consumption in large areas of the study area. The presented approach is applicable to the assessment of groundwater in desert regions in the Middle East area.

Recently, drought-resistant bacterial isolates are used to combat drought resistance in crops. In this in vitro study, 20 bacterial isolates were isolated from harsh soil; their drought tolerance was evaluated using four concentrations of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000. The two most efficient isolates (DS4 and DS9) were selected and identified using 16S rRNA genetic sequencing. They were registered in the NCBI database and deposited under accession numbers MW916285 and MW916307 for Bacillus cereus (DS4) and Bacillus albus (DS9), respectively. These isolates were screened for plant growth-promoting properties compared to non-stressed conditions. Biochemical parameters; Proline, salicylic acid, gibberellic acid (GA), indole acetic acid (IAA), antioxidant activity, and antioxidant enzymes were measured under the same conditions, and in vitro seed germination was tested under stress conditions and inoculation with selected isolates. The results showed that under the harsh conditions of PEG6000, DS4 produced the highest amount of IAA of 1.61 mg/ml, followed by DS9 with 0.9 mg/ml. The highest amount of GA (49.95 mg/ml) was produced by DS9. On the other hand, the highest amount of siderophore was produced from DS4 isolate followed by DS9. Additionally, DS4 isolate recorded the highest exopolysaccharide (EPS) content of 3.4 mg/ml under PEG (-1.2 MPa) followed by DS9. The antioxidant activity increased in PEG concentrations depending manner, and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes increased, as catalase (CAT) recorded the highest activity in DS4 with an amount of 1.095 mg/ml. additionally, an increase in biofilm formation was observed under drought conditions. The isolated mixture protected the plant from the harmful effects of drought and showed an increase in the measured variables. Under unstressed conditions, the highest rates of emulsification index (EI 24%) were obtained for DS4 and DS9, at 14.92 and 11.54, respectively, and decreased under stress. The highest values of germination, total seedling length, and vigor index were obtained upon inoculation with the combination of two strains, and were 100%, 4.10 cm, and 410, respectively. Therefore, two strains combination is an effective vaccine capable of developing and improving drought tolerance in dryland plants. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Understanding the fate of eroded C at the watershed scale thus provides essential guidance for balancing the C budget and evaluating soil management strategies. In this study, we collected a total of 229 topsoils of source materials [land use types (forests, grassland, cropland, orchard, and fallow) and gully bank] and a total of 56 surface sediment samples [main river channel (18) and three tributaries (38) with different erosion intensity]. Multiple tracers (C and nitrogen (N) isotopes, molecular n-alkane biomarker, and spectroscopic indices) applied widely were then analyzed to determine relative source contributions to eroded organic matter (OM) (including bulk OM and water-extractable OM) in sediments at a broader watershed on the Loess Plateau of China. The results from an isotopic mixing model analysis showed that gully bank was the primary contributor of bulk OM in sediments, accounting for mean probability estimate (MPE) 55.3%, followed by "grassland" (MPE 21.0%), "cropland" (MPE 14.4%), and "forests" (MPE 9.3%). The contributions of grassland and cropland showed an increasing trend from upstream to downstream sections of the studied watershed. The contribution of forests was found higher in upstream than those of midstream and downstream. Along with previous evidences, our results show that erosion intensity mainly affects the proportion of C source, where gully bank was found as the highest contributor in three associated catchments, especially in region with light erosion intensity. We further demonstrated that the sediment bulk OM deposited was mainly derived from the region with light erosion intensity at the broader watershed scale. Moreover, results of n-alkane ratios and spectroscopic indices also implied that biological production of OM other than terrestrial sources (i.e., soil OM) might play a critical role in source contribution of water-extractable OM in sediments of main river channel.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				OCT	2020	193								104623	10.1016/j.catena.2020.104623	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.104623													WOS:000538770800027

At the start of experiment, the profile soil water storage (SWS0-500 cm) under introduced peashrub and alfalfa was, respectively, 18.8% and 12.2% lower than that under natural grassland. This showed that there was higher water consumption by planted vegetation, compared with native grass. After thinning, SWS0-500 cm in thinned peashrub and alfalfa plots was significantly higher than that in unthinned plots due to decrease in both interception and transpiration. The increase in SWS0-500 cm in the 100% thinned peashrub plot (159.9-216.1 mm) was much higher than that in 50% thinned peashrub (39.1-169.8 mm) and 100% thinned alfalfa (20.3-118.1 mm) plots. This indicated that the extent of soil water recovery varied with thinning intensity and vegetation type. At the end of the third growing season, soil water restoration frontier in the thinned peashrub and alfalfa plots (>300 cm) was much greater than that in the unthinned plots (<180 cm). It also indicated that with thinning, soil water (<300 cm) can recover rapidly following two successive wet years. The results suggested that concerns about soil desiccation and the potential impact on long-term sustainability of restored ecosystems on CLP were resolvable.																			0008-4271	1918-1841				SEP	2020	100	3					302	313		10.1139/cjss-2020-0010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjss-2020-0010													WOS:000566331500012

Merr.) varieties grown in Eastern Zambia	COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE												Zambia has three primary agro-ecological regions, with each region having specific ecological characteristics. Region II agro-ecological zone of Zambia has low nutrient reserves and poor water holding capacity due to moderately leached clayey to loamy soil; this has led to low soybean productivity. Soil fertility management (ISFM) strategies such as the use of inorganic fertilizers and the use of inoculants of rhizobia have been introduced and promoted among small-scale farmers in Eastern Province. Two soybean varieties (Lukanga and Kafue) were used for this study and 96 samples from on-farm soil fertility management trials in Chipata, and Petauke districts were collected for the determinations of nutritional and anti-nutritional properties. The proximate analysis of Chipata samples showed that the ash content 5.10-6.23%, fat content 17.71-25.57%, protein content 27.73-37.11%, amylose content 1.26-4.56 %, sugar content 6.75-9.62%, and starch content 4.00-18.57%, while anti-nutritional properties ranged between 3.07 and 8.21% for phytate and 1.42-3.35% for tannin. With Petauke, the ash content 3.32-6.8 %, fat content 19.16-26.85%, protein content 27.68-35.62%, amylose 2.00-4.37%, sugar content 6.23-9.76%, and starch content 5.70-18.63%. Phytate and tannin contents were 3.37-7.90% and 0.14-3.32%, respectively. The highest protein content was found at the level of 37.11% in Kafue with 40kg P/ha and inoculant, and the least was 27.73% for Lukanga without inputs in Chipata while in Petauke, Lukanga with 40 P/ha and inoculant had the highest protein content of 35.62% and the least was 27.68% for Lukanga with inoculant. The co-application of rhizobia inoculant and P nutrient increased phytate, and tannin content significantly (P < 0.05).

Diversity in perception and management of farming risks in southern Mali	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												A deeper understanding of how smallholder farmers perceive and manage risks is crucial to identify options that increase farmers' adaptive capacity. We investigated a broad range of risks that play a role in farmers' decision-making processes. In the cotton zone of Mali opportunities and constraints vary with the resource endowment of farms. Furthermore, as households are large in this region, often comprising 20-50 family members, intra-household diversity may influence perceptions and risk management. For this reason, we analysed diversity both among and within farms. Information was gathered through focus group discussions and a survey with 250 people from 58 households. Risk was assessed as the combination of the perceived frequency of occurrence of hazards and the impact on food availability and income. Farmers faced a diversity of risks, with hazards related to animal and personal health, and climate variability of highest concern. Resource endowment of farms was related to risk perception to a limited extent. Differences within the household were related to the generational factor and decision power, and not to gender. Household members with decision power worried most about risks. Almost a quarter of described hazards occurred with a high frequency and led to a high impact on food availability and income. Low resource-endowed farms were more often exposed to high risks than other farm types. Farmers applied a variety of actions to cope with hazards, yet in many cases farmers lacked a response. Medical actions were targeted to human and animal health hazards. Changes in field and animal management practices, adapted consumption rates and calls on social interactions, were combined for a diversity of hazards. By assessing the diversity of risks encountered by farmers and the diversity of risk management actions taken by farmers, this study goes beyond common risk research that focuses on a single hazard. Our results suggest that development interventions should not focus on either agronomic or economic options separately, but combine both to strengthen social well-being and agricultural production.

In this context, we report here the Arachis hypogaea gene expression atlas (AhGEA) for the world's widest cultivated subsp. fastigiata based on RNA-seq data using 20 diverse tissues across five key developmental stages. Approximately 480 million paired-end filtered reads were generated followed by identification of 81 901 transcripts from an early-maturing, high-yielding, drought-tolerant groundnut variety, ICGV 91114. Further, 57 344 genome-wide transcripts were identified with >= 1 FPKM across different tissues and stages. Our in-depth analysis of the global transcriptome sheds light into complex regulatory networks namely gravitropism and photomorphogenesis, seed development, allergens and oil biosynthesis in groundnut. Importantly, interesting insights into molecular basis of seed development and nodulation have immense potential for translational genomics research. We have also identified a set of stable expressing transcripts across the selected tissues, which could be utilized as internal controls in groundnut functional genomics studies. The AhGEA revealed potential transcripts associated with allergens, which upon appropriate validation could be deployed in the coming years to develop consumer-friendly groundnut varieties. Taken together, the AhGEA touches upon various important and key features of cultivated groundnut and provides a reference for further functional, comparative and translational genomics research for various economically important traits.

This is particularly true for pest regulation by natural enemies in agroecosystems. However, it is generally difficult to decipher the impact of predators, as they often leave no direct evidence of their activity. Metabarcoding via high-throughput sequencing (HTS) offers new opportunities for unraveling trophic linkages between generalist predators and their prey, and ultimately identifying key ecological drivers of natural pest regulation. Here, this approach proved effective in deciphering the diet composition of key predatory arthropods (nine species.; 27 prey taxa), insectivorous birds (one species, 13 prey taxa) and bats (one species; 103 prey taxa) sampled in a millet-based agroecosystem in Senegal. Such information makes it possible to identify the diet breadth and preferences of predators (e.g., mainly moths for bats), to design a qualitative trophic network, and to identify patterns of intraguild predation across arthropod predators, insectivorous vertebrates and parasitoids. Appropriateness and limitations of the proposed molecular-based approach for assessing the diet of crop pest predators and trophic linkages are discussed.

However, it is unlear how vegetation restoration affects soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N) and their losses based on the grid measured data of regional scale. In this study, at the watershed scale, the SOC, N, nutrient losses, sequestration rates, sequestration potential, and influencing factors of croplands, orchards, grasslands, forests and human settlements were assessed through 113 sampling points. Results showed that natural vegetation soil exhibited the highest SOC storage (38.9 Mg center dot ha- 1) and N storage (0.86 Mg center dot ha- 1), and grasslands had the highest SOC sequestration rate (19.2 kg center dot hm- 2 center dot yr- 1) and N sequestration potential (5.7 kg center dot yr- 1). Additionally, forests had the highest SOC sequestration rate (0.43 Mg center dot hm- 2 center dot yr- 1), and orchards had the highest SOC sequestration potential (161.2 Mg center dot yr- 1). The SOC storage, N storage, and sequestration potential of artificial vegetation were mainly affected by the soil particles and bulk density, however, the SOC storage, N storage, and sequestration potential of natural vegetation were mainly affected by the soil aggregate stability and soil C: N. In addition, the heaviest losses of SOC and N occurred in grasslands, with the highest average amounts in orchards, and the lowest average amounts in forests. We put forward general management suggestions for different vegetation types and focus on four measures for the management of orchards, with a view toward reducing SOC and N losses in different land use types.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014; 朱, 广宇/GQZ-5189-2022	ZHU, GUANGYU/0000-0002-8641-2422													1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2021	133								108443	10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108443	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108443		DEC 2021											WOS:000728758000001

The environmental benefits of ecological restoration can at least be partially neutralized by enhanced nitrogen (N) loss and potential nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions via denitrification. However, few studies have focussed on comparative analysis of the contributions of ecological restoration strategies to soil denitrifying microbes, particularly in arid and semiarid degraded ecosystems, where N is often the limiting nutrient. In this study, artificial afforestation (artificial forest sites) and natural revegetation (grassland sites) of abandoned farmland have an enhanced effect on reducing potential denitrification rates (PDR) compared with farmland sites and orchard sites, leading to lower N losses and potential N2O emissions. Combined analyses indicated that the greatest differences in microbial abundance, species richness, and diversity were observed among different ecological restoration strategies. The abundance, richness, and diversities of denitrifying microbes (nirS, nirK, and nosZ genes) were decreased by natural revegetation and artificial afforestation, leading to attenuated denitrifying activity responsible for the reduced PDR. Notably, the abundance and diversity of denitrifying microbes were dominant variables that explained the changes in PDR (up to 0.96). Overall, our results contribute to a better understanding of the feedback of denitrifying microorganisms to ecological restoration strategies and how these microorganisms collaboratively contribute to N loss and potential N2O emissions in arid and semiarid degraded ecosystems.																			1085-3278	1099-145X				MAY 30	2020	31	9					1086	1098		10.1002/ldr.3523	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.3523		JAN 2020											WOS:000508901800001

In this study, a method for predicting the runoff caused by extreme sub-rainfall events was constructed based on the identification of extreme rainfall events, Mann-Kendall Test, R/S analysis, and regression analysis. The method was applied to the Jingle sub-basin, and the results showed that the extreme precipitation in this basin will maintain a slight rising trend in the future, assuming that the climate and underlying conditions remain the same as they were in the current scenario. There is a more stable correlational relationship between rainfall characteristic factors and runoff in extreme rainfall events. The extreme precipitation of 1-5 consecutive days under the 100a return period designed by the hydrological frequency method is 38.74, 60.01, 66.00, 71.44, and 73.69 mm, respectively, and the possible runoff predicted by the four empirical formulas is 1295-2495, 2108-4935, 2408-5801, and 3051-7062 x 10(4) m(3), respectively. The rainfall designed by the hydrological frequency combination method is 203.64 mm, and the possible runoff predicted by the four empirical formulas is 2.8-5.3 x 10(8) m(3). This study can provide a new reference for predicting the possible incoming runoff under extreme sub-rainfall events.					王, 亚飞/HJG-9433-2022	王, 亚飞/0000-0001-6984-6918														2296-665X				JUN 1	2022	10								812351	10.3389/fenvs.2022.812351	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.812351													WOS:000811684700001

Caragana korshinskii plantations are valued for their critical role in soil and water conservation in the Loess Hilly Region. This study aimed to estimate the levels of soil carbon and nitrogen and their dissolved fractions in one farmland (Zea mays L.) and three C. korshinskii plantations at 15, 30 and 40 years; additionally, the distribution of soil carbon and nitrogen stocks among various soil depths were estimated. The results showed that afforestation with C. korshinskii resulted in a significant increase in the contents and stocks of SOC and TN and their dissolved fractions. At a depth of 0-10 cm, the 30-year-old C. korshinskii had the highest stocks of SOC and TN, but at depths of 40-100 and 100-200 cm, the highest SOC and TN stocks were found in the soil of 15-year-old C. korshinskii. The 15-year-old C. korshinskii had the highest stocks of SOC and TN at depths of 0-200 cm and the highest stocks of dissolved nitrogen across almost all soil layers. The soil at 100-200 cm contained 34%-54% of the total percentages of the cumulative stocks of SOC and TN and their fractions. The SOC stock was the most important factor affecting the variation in soil nitrogen fractions and contributed to more than 80% of the total variation; additionally, the nitrate (NO3-N) content and stock were the most important factors affecting the soil carbon fractions, contributing to 78% of the total variation. This study demonstrates that revegetation age and soil depth play important roles in determining carbon and nitrogen levels. The results also suggest that C. korshinskii plantations should be harvested and revegetated during the rapid growth period (similar to 15 years) during which they show the largest accumulations of soil carbon and nitrogen.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				SEP	2022	216		A						106405	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106405	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106405		MAY 2022											WOS:000831120800005

Considerable research into the seroprevalence of JE in domestic animals has been conducted, but there have been no reports of its occurrence in wild animals, including long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis). This study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of JEV infection and its determinants in long-tailed macaques in Bali and the prevalence of mosquito vectors. Materials and Methods: Blood samples (3 mL) were collected from a population of M. fascicularis (92 heads) inhabiting a small forest with irrigated rice field nearby (wetland area) in Ubud, Gianyar, and from two populations in dryland areas with no wet rice field (Uluwatu, Badung. and Nusa Penida, Bali Province, Indonesia). The collected sera were tested for antibodies against JEV using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (qualitative monkey JE Immunoglobulin G antibody kit). The seropositivity of the antibodies was then compared based on different variables, namely, habitat type, age, and sex. Results: The seroprevalence of the JEV antibodies in all the samples tested was found to be 41.3%. The seropositivity of the monkey serum samples collected from the wetland area was 46.4%, which was higher than the seropositivity of the sera samples collected from the dried field areas (1.25%). Monkey sera collected from the wetland areas were 6.1 times (odds ratio [On 6.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71-51.5, p>0.05) more likely to be seropositive compared to the monkey sera collected from the dried field areas. Meanwhile, female monkeys were 1.79 times (OR: 1.79; 95% CI: 0.76-4.21: p>0.05) more likely to be seropositive to JEV than males. Similarly, juvenile monkeys were 2.38 times (OR: 2.38; 95% CI: 0.98-5.79); p>0.05) more likely to be seropositive against the JEV than adult monkeys. However, none of these differences achieved statistical significance. Regarding the JEV mosquito vector collection, more Culex mosquitoes were found in the samples from the wetland areas than from the dried field areas. Conclusion: The study confirms the existence of JEV infection in long-tailed macaques in Bali. There were patterned seropositivity differences based on habitat. age. and sex of the monkeys, but these were not significant. The possibility of monkeys as a JEV reservoir and the presence of the mosquitoes as the JEV vector are suggested but require more study to confirm.

The detail understanding about the responses of different C pools to land uses is essential for maintaining the soil quality. The present study was undertaken in six rainfed land use systems of north eastern Punjab, India comprising of agriculture, horticulture, agri-horticulture, forestry, agroforestry and barren lands. The soil samples (0-15 cm) were collected and analyzed for soil carbon fractions and biochemical activities. The oxidisable carbon fractions i.e. very labile carbon, labile carbon, less labile carbon, recalcitrant carbon and total organic carbon contents in soil varied significantly from 0.09%-0.22%, 0.09%-0.23%, 0.02%-0.15%, 0.15%-0.72% and 0.83%-4.68%, respectively. The soil dehydrogenase activity, soil microbial biomass carbon, metabolic and microbial quotients showed significant variations and ranged from 5.4 -10.9 mu g TPF g(-1) soil h(-1), 34.9 -184.5 mu g g(-1)soil, 0.0011-0.0034, 45.0-195.5, respectively. Agri-horticulture and forestry system were observed to be best environment friendly and sustainable system in rainfed regions. Carbon management index (28.9%), metabolic potential (9.8%) and total organic carbon (5.4%) were three topmost soil quality indicators for soil health in rainfed land use systems.

FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												MicroRNA (miRNA) is an essential endogenous post-transcriptional regulatory factor, and foxtail millet (Setaria italica L.) is an ideal C4 model cereal that is a highly valuable crop in semiarid and arid areas. The Research on comprehensive and high confidence identification and annotation of foxtail millet miRNAs needs to be strengthened, and to our knowledge, there is no information on the regulatory network of foxtail millet miRNA. In this study, 136 high confidence miRNAs were identified through high-throughput sequencing of the small RNAs in seven tissues at the shooting and grain filling stages of foxtail millet. A total of 2,417 target genes were obtained by combining computational biology software and degradome sequencing methods. Furthermore, an analysis using transcriptome sequencing revealed the relationships between miRNAs and their target genes and simultaneously explored key regulatory modules in panicles during the grain filling stage. An miRNA regulatory network was constructed to explore the functions of miRNA in more detail. This network, centered on miRNAs and combining upstream transcriptional factors and downstream target genes, is primarily composed of feed forward loop motifs, which greatly enhances our knowledge of the potential functions of miRNAs and uncovers numerous previously unknown regulatory links. This study provides a solid foundation for research on the function and regulatory network of miRNAs in foxtail millet.

Photosynthetic and grain yield responses to intercropping of two common bean lines with maize under two types of fertilizer applications in the colombian amazon region	SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE												Acid soils in the Amazon region are characterized by low fertility and high aluminum saturation causing reduced crop yields. Improving genetic adaptation of crop genotypes together with suitable agronomic management practices can mitigate the impact on crop production in acid soils. The objective of the present study was to determine the photosynthetic and grain yield responses of two common bean lines to intercropping with maize under two types of fertilizer applications in the Colombian Amazon region. A randomized complete block design (RCBD) with 3 replications in a nested trifactorial arrangement was used consisting of two advanced bean lines of BFS 10 and ALB 121 (main plots); three cropping system patterns of monoculture, intercropping pattern 1, intercropping pattern 2 (subplots); and two types of fertilizer applications, chemical and organic (sub-subplots) for a total of 12 treatments. The experiment was conducted in two growing seasons and the effects of the treatments were evaluated during two growth stages within a cropping season. Measurements included photosynthetic gas exchange characteristics, chlorophyll fluorescence, specific leaf area, viability of pollen and grain yield. Mean values from two growing seasons were presented. Photosynthetic response of BFS 10 was superior to ALB 121 under both monoculture and intercropping patterns with either chemical or organic fertilizer application. Both bean lines showed an increase in apparent quantum efficiency and maximum rate of ribulose-1, 5bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) carboxylation (Vcmax) during pod filling growth stage when grown in association with maize, particularly with organic fertilizer application. Small farmers in the Amazon region can benefit from either one of the two bean lines by growing them as intercrops with maize, using organic fertilizer application.

EUPHYTICA												Iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) are important micronutrients for human health and well-being. Groundnut kernels are good sources of Fe and Zn. Localization studies of Fe and Zn in the kernel tissues of ten diverse groundnut genotypes revealed that, cotyledons contribute nearly 85-90% of total Fe and Zn in comparison to seed coat and embryo on dry matter basis. Generation mean analysis revealed the predominant role of additive gene action for kernel Fe and Zn concentration in the cross ICGV 06,040 x ICGV 87,141, and both additive and additive x additive interaction in the cross ICGV 06,099 x ICGV 93,468. Duplicate epistasis was observed for kernel Fe and Zn concentrations in both the crosses. For yield parameters, pod yield per plant and 100-kernel weight, dominance gene action was significant. Additive x additive interaction was also found to be significant for these traits which can be fixed through selection. For days to maturity, additive, dominance, additive x additive and dominance x dominance interactions were significant. The study involved six generations of two crosses involving parents with contrasting kernel Fe and Zn concentrations and was conducted for five economically important traits using a six-parameter model. There was significant positive association between kernel Fe and Zn concentration in both the crosses indicating possibility of simultaneous improvement. Absence of association of kernel Fe and Zn concentration with pod yield per plant will enable the development of high pod-yielding varieties with elevated levels of kernel Fe and Zn concentration.

Walp.) Landraces in Ethiopia	ADVANCES IN AGRICULTURE												The study was conducted to estimate the effects of genotype, environment, and genotype x environment interaction on grain yield and yield-related traits and to identify stability genotype. At six environments, twenty-four cowpea landraces and one check were evaluated in a 5 x 5 triple lattice during the 2019 cropping season. Data were collected on yield and yield-related traits. The analysis of variance for each environment and across environments showed significant differences among genotypes, environments, and GEI for most traits including yield. Environment, genotype, and GEI showed 27.45%, 20.9%, and 49.55% contribution to the total sum of squares, respectively, for grain yield. This indicated that the environments were diverse and most of the variation in grain yield was caused due to interaction and environmental means. G24 (2632 kg ha(-1)) and G16 (2290 kg ha(-1)) were the highest yielder and stable genotypes with mean grain yields above the grand mean (2049.28 kg ha(-1)) and standard check (2273 kg ha(-1)). G24 and G16 were the most stable genotypes according to cultivar superiority, Wricke's ecovalence, regression coefficient, and devotion from regression stability models.</p>																			2356-654X	2314-7539				OCT 21	2021	2021								3786945	10.1155/2021/3786945	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/3786945													WOS:000715771600001

Impact of Climate Variability on Species Abundance of Rice Insect Pests across Agro Climatic Zones of India	JOURNAL OF AGROMETEOROLOGY					3rd International Symposium on Advances in Agrometeorology for Managing Climatic Risks of Farmers (INAGMET)	FEB 11-13, 2019	New Delhi, INDIA	Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Indian Council Agr Res & Indian Agr Res Inst, India Meteorol Dept, Assoc Agrometeorologists, Delhi Chapter				Impact of changing temperature and rainfall on abundance of four rice insect pests viz., yellow stem borer (YSB), leaf folder (LF), brown plant hopper (BPH) and green leafhopper during kharif 2011-16 was assessed for seven rice growing locations in India. While YSB and GLH had maximum abundance at Chinsurah (West Bengal) and Raipur (Chatisgarh), respectively Ludhiana (Punjab) had the highest LF and BPH abundance. Magnitude of variability of maximum temperature (MaxT(0)C), minimum temperature (MinT(0)C) and rainfall (RF mm) quantified for 2011-16 over long term `normals' showed significant spatial heterogeneity with all three variables significantly increasing at Karjat (Maharashtra) and Kampasagar (Telangana). None of the variables had significance at Chinsurah (WB). Three, five and two locations had increasing MaxT (1.4-3.6(0)C), MinT (-0.58-1.85(0)C) and RF (42.8-84.8mm/week), respectively. Kendall's tau correlations between abundance of each insect and deviations of climatic values derived for MaxT, MinT and RF on weekly basis had also shown spatially variable significance with 78% associations negative indicating decreasing species abundance in relation to changing climate. Increasing YSB and GLH with increasing MaxT (0.27(0)C) and MinT (0.93(0)C) at Raipur (CG) and of LF at Aduthurai (Tamilnadu) with increasing rainfall (5.43 mm/week) revealed their increasing importance from pest management perspective.

MODELING COTTON GROWTH AND YIELD RESPONSE TO IRRIGATION PRACTICES FOR THERMALLY LIMITED GROWING SEASONS IN KANSAS	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Precipitation in the western Great Plains averages about 450 mm, varying little with latitude and providing 40% to 80% of potential crop evapotranspiration (ETc). Supplemental irrigation is required to fully meet crop water demand, but the Ogallala or High Plains aquifer is essentially non-recharging south of Nebraska. Pumping water from this aquifer draws down water tables, leading to reduced water availability and deficit irrigation to produce an alternate crop such as cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) with a lower peak water demand than corn (Zea mays L.). Our objective was to compare simulated cotton yield response to emergence date, irrigation capacity, and application period at three western Kansas locations (Colby, Tribune, and Garden City) with varying seasonal energy or cumulative growing degree days (CGDD) and compare split center pivot deficit irrigation strategies with a fixed water supply (i.e., where portions of the center pivot land area are managed with different irrigation strategies). We used actual 1961-2000 location weather records with the GOSSYM simulation model to estimate yields of cotton planted into soil at 50% plant-available water for three emergence dates (DOY 145, 152, and 159) and all combinations of irrigation period (0, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks beginning at first square) and capacity (2.5, 3.75, and 5.0 mm d(-1)). Simulated lint yield and its ratio to ETc, or water use efficiency (WUE), consistently decreased with delayed planting (emergence) as location elevation or latitude increased due to effects on growing season CGDD. Depending on location, simulated cotton lint consistently increased (p = 0.05) for scenarios with increasing irrigation capacity, which promoted greater early season boll load, but not for durations exceeding 4 to 6 weeks, probably because later irrigation and fruiting did not complete maturation during the short growing season. Cotton WUE generally increased, with greater yields resulting from earlier emergence and early high-capacity irrigation. We calculated lower WUE where irrigation promoted vigorous growth with added fruiting forms that delayed maturation and reduced the fraction of open bolls. The irrigation strategy of focusing water at higher capacities on a portion of the center pivot in combination with the dryland balance did not increase net yields significantly at any location because the available seasonal energy limited potential crop growth and yield response to irrigation. However, the overall net lint yield was numerically larger for focused irrigation strategies at the southwest Kansas location (Garden City). Based on lint yields simulated under uniform or split center pivot deficit irrigation, we conclude that cotton is poorly suited as an alternative crop for central western and northwestern Kansas because of limited growing season CGDD.

What Does Gender Yield Gap Tell Us about Smallholder Farming in Developing Countries?	SUSTAINABILITY												This study examines the extent of the productivity gap between male and female bean producers, its discriminatory nature and implications for the policymakers in agriculture in Tanzania. Generally, women are distinctively "invisible" in agriculture, due to social norms and even from the national agricultural policy perspective. Their discrimination arises from uncounted and unaccounted for farm work, and their productivity is reduced by triple roles, limited access to education, having triple effects on access to technology, training and land rights. In research, issues of concern to them such as nutritious food crops, varietal selection on important attributes, household food security, convenient home storage and small-scale processing are widely ignored through unfavourable policy design. Given the above discriminatory issues surrounding women in agriculture, they are hypothesised to be less productive and often lag behind male counterparts in crop production. To test the above hypothesis, a three-stage stratified sampling method was used to collect cross-sectional data in 2016 across four regions of Tanzania. Then, an Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method (at means) was used to apportion the sources of the difference between men and women into explained and unexplained variations. Further improvements through the newly developed Re-Centered Influence Functions (RIFs) remarkably improved outcomes as the differences were analysed through unconditional partial effects on quantiles. Using a counterfactual approach and correcting for selection bias, the model provided consistent estimates for easy comparison of the two groups. Besides this, it emerged that interventions such as providing improved bean seed varieties and training farmers on good agricultural practices reduced the gender yield gap and provided a potential avenue for addressing the discrimination observed in productivity among males and females. Controlling for selection bias also improved the model, but the real discrimination was observed at the 50th percentile, where the majority of the respondents lay within. However, if a female's age, family size, additional years of schooling and discretion to spend income from beans were taken away, they would be worse off. Our study finds that females comprised 25 percent of the sample, had 6 percent lower productivity, provided 64.70 percent on-farm labour and had 0.32 hectares less land compared to males, ceteris paribus. Access to improved varieties contributed to a 35.4 percent improved productivity compared to growing indigenous/local varieties. The implication is that the gender yield gap can be reduced significantly if efforts are focused on preventing or correcting factors causing discrimination against women.

J	Pan, SL; Shi, J; Peng, YM; Wang, Z; Wang, X				Pan, Shuling; Shi, Jia; Peng, Yumei; Wang, Zi; Wang, Xiang			Soil organic carbon pool distribution and stability with grazing and topography in a Mongolian grassland	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Livestock grazing and topography have long been recognized as essential factors that control soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. However, the interplay effects of grazing and topography on SOC pool distribution and stability are not well understood, hindering the precise prediction of the organic carbon (OC) fate over the hillslope grassland. Here, we examine the relationship between grazing and topography on SOC pool distribution and stability in a Mongolian grassland. We determined a suite of OC metrics (e.g., particulate OC (POC), mineralassociated OC (MAOC), dissolved OC (DOC), and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) along a topographic gradient (e.g., upper slope, middle slope, and downslope) with grazing or not, and incubation was conducted to quantify OC stability. The results showed that POC and SOC content was 106-138% and 24-63% greater in the grazed than the ungrazed site at low topographic positions, respectively. Across the landscape, more variations in POC and SOC across the topographic gradient were observed at the grazed sites than at ungrazed sites. The MBC content of the downslope was greater in the grazing than in ungrazed sites. Furthermore, the humic-like substances in the grazing area were lower than those in the enclosed area and showed a significant and positive linear relationship with the aromaticity and humification of DOC. The aggregated boosted tree (ABT) analysis showed that the POC and MBC were the most important OC components to affect OC pool stability (accounting for 40.87%). The structural equation model (SEM) supported that the varies of POC regulated the downstream soil biochemical processes and changed SOC pool stability. Collectively, the results suggest the POC could be primarily responsible for the changes in SOC pools and stability in a hillslope grassland. These findings enhanced our understanding of the ecological mechanisms in SOC sequestration.					zhao, hang/JVM-8270-2024; wang, hao/JKH-5890-2023; Chen, Xin/JDN-2017-2023; WANG, HUI/JFA-9683-2023; wang, hang/JND-8481-2023; liu, huan/JEO-4705-2023; wang, yixuan/JGM-3893-2023; wang, wenxin/JOZ-3291-2023; Wang, Hao/ABB-8923-2020; liu, huan/JKI-3764-2023; chen, yan/JRY-4645-2023; Liu, yujing/JQI-7225-2023; Wang, Minghao/JMD-0670-2023; LIU, HUI/JPX-8014-2023; luo, yuan/JLS-6416-2023; WANG, Bin/JGM-2639-2023; Li, jiaqi/JOZ-6395-2023	Wang, Hao/0000-0001-9109-6017; 													0167-8809	1873-2305				JUN 1	2023	348								108431	10.1016/j.agee.2023.108431	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2023.108431		FEB 2023											WOS:001007470500001

Coping with cereal production risks due to the vagaries of weather, labour shortages and input markets through management in southern Mali	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												Production of cereals (maize, sorghum, millet) in southern Mali is challenged by several hazards that affect yield and yield variability. The research aims to inform decision making towards effective risk management by quantifying cereal yield losses at field level due to production hazards under different management strategies. Five hazards relevant for farmers were analysed: late onset of rains, insufficient total rainfall, dry spells, low fertiliser quality and sudden lack of labour. The frequency and impact on yield of these hazards were assessed by combining a long term weather database (1965-2019) with outputs of the DSSAT crop model (baseline and optimised variety, fertiliser rates and sowing dates), and visualised in a risk matrix. The prevalence of the weather hazards was common, with all of them occurring at least once every five years. Frequency of non -weather hazards were perceived to occur once every five years (labour hazards) and once every ten years (fertiliser hazards). Under baseline conditions maize (3.39 t / ha) outperformed sorghum (1.74 t / ha) and millet (1.33 t / ha), except in cases of fertiliser hazard when sorghum yielded more than maize. Maize responded relatively well to N application, and sorghum performed relatively well without N application. The benefit of millet resided in low yield variability, and lower sensitivity to the weather hazards. Changing management to optimise yields generally involved early sowing (22 days, 2 days and 27 days after onset for maize, sorghum and millet), increased N applications (66 kg N / ha, 27 kg N / ha and 111 kg N / ha for maize, sorghum and millet), and using short duration varieties. For millet the long duration variety was more beneficial. For maize there was opportunity to increase the yield without affecting the risk of yield loss, while for sorghum there was a synergy and for millet a trade-off between yield and risk. The different interactions between hazards and management for the three cereals stress the importance of maintaining farm diversity, as well as operational farm flexibility to respond to production risks.

J	Pei, YW; Huang, LM; Shao, MA; Zhang, YL				Pei, Yanwu; Huang, Laiming; Shao, Ming'an; Zhang, Yinglong			Responses of <i>Amygdalus pedunculata</i> Pall. in the sandy and loamy soils to water stress	JOURNAL OF ARID LAND												Amygdalus pedunculata Pall. is a major species that is widely planted in afforested soils with different textures in the transitional zone between Mu Us Desert and Loess Plateau, China. However, the responses of A. pedunculata to increasing intensity of water stress in different textural soils are not clear. Here, we conducted a soil column experiment to evaluate the effects of different textures (sandy and loamy) on water consumption, water use efficiency (WUE), biomass accumulation and ecological adaptability of A. pedunculata under increasing water stress, i.e., 90% (+/- 5%) FC (field capacity), 75% (+/- 5%) FC, 60% (+/- 5%) FC, 45% (+/- 5%) FC and 30% (+/- 5%) FC in 2018. A. pedunculata grown in the sandy soil with the lowest (30% FC) and highest (90% FC) water contents had respectively 21.3%-37.0% and 4.4%-20.4% less transpiration than those with other water treatments (45%-75% FC). In contrast, A. pedunculata transpiration in the loamy soil decreased with decreasing water content. The magnitude of decrease in transpiration increased with increasing level of water deficit (45% and 30% FC). Mean daily and cumulative transpirations of the plant were significantly lower in the sandy soil than in the loamy soil under good water condition (90% FC), but the reverse was noted under water deficit treatments (45% and 30% FC). Plant height, stem diameter and total biomass initially increased with decreasing water content from 90% to 75% FC and then declined under severe water deficit conditions (45% and 30% FC) in the sandy soil. However, these plant parameters decreased with decreasing water content in the loamy soil. WUE in the sandy soil was 7.8%-12.3% higher than that in the loamy soil, which initially increased with decreasing water content from 90% to 75% FC and then declined under water deficit conditions (45% and 30% FC). The study showed that plant transpiration, biomass production and WUE responded differentially to increasing intensity of water stress in the sandy and loamy soils. The contrasting responses of A. pedunculata to water stress in different textural soils can guide future revegetation programs in the northern region of Chinese Loess Plateau by considering plant adaptability to varying soil and water conditions.																			1674-6767	2194-7783				SEP	2020	12	5					791	805		10.1007/s40333-020-0016-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-020-0016-7		NOV 2020											WOS:000588887100001

Accessions Based on Microsatellite Markers (SSRs)	CHEMISTRY & BIODIVERSITY												In the current investigation, 28 accessions of Spanish and Tunisian peas were characterized by eight SSR polymorphic markers to assess their genetic diversity. Many methods have been applied to evaluate these relationships including diversity indices, analysis of molecular variance, cluster analysis, and population structure. The means of diversity indices, the polymorphism information content (PIC), the allelic richness, and the Shannon information index were 0.51, 3.87, and 0.9, respectively. These results revealed a large polymorphism (84.15 %) which produced a higher degree of genetic distance amongst the accessions. The unweighted pair group approach with arithmetic mean divided the collection of these accessions into three major genetic clusters. Therefore, this article has clearly demonstrated the usefulness of the SSR markers that can significantly contribute to the management and conservation of pea germplasm in these countries, as well as to future reproduction.						mohamed, amina/0000-0002-2948-6433													1612-1872	1612-1880				2023 APR 25	2023										10.1002/cbdv.202201033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cbdv.202201033		APR 2023						37026685					WOS:000975116000001

Our current understanding of the effects of the soil texture and water potential on the root:shoot ratio is rather poor.Methods Thus, we conducted a pot experiment where we measured the dry weights of the roots and shoots to investigate the responses of ryegrass (Lolium perenne, L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa, L.) in terms of C allocation to different soil textures and water potentials.Results The root:shoot ratios in ryegrass and alfalfa were significantly affected by the soil texture, but not by the soil water potential (-400 kPa to -40 kPa). Integrated analysis of previous studies indicated a significant average negative correlation between the root:shoot ratio and clay content according to a linear mixed model (k = -0.0045). This correlation might be related to the hydraulic properties of the root-soil contact zone.Conclusions We assume that the soil water potential in our experiment was insufficient to affect root hydraulic conductivity, but further evidence is required. Our findings could be useful for future estimates of ecosystem C stocks.																			0718-9508	0718-9516				MAR	2023	23	1					1297	1305		10.1007/s42729-022-01121-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42729-022-01121-2		JAN 2023											WOS:000907818500001

The study examines how gender and climate risk awareness influence sorghum and pearl millet farmers' varietal trait and cropping system choices in Malawi. The findings reveal gender disparities in choices of crop variety characteristics. For male farmers, decisions on variety traits are primarily guided by quantity and economic benefits, while women focus on post-harvest quality and grain handling attributes. This work provides insights for developing gender-responsive crop varieties and climate-smart cropping practices tailored to societal needs and relations.SummaryClimate-resilient crop varieties and cropping systems are required to manage climate variability and to adapt to the increasing climate risks across Africa. Integrating gender perspectives on cropping technologies will assist in accelerating crop adaptation programs. Here, we focus on understanding gender-differentiated trait preferences and decision-making on cropping practices of sorghum and pearl millet producers in southern Malawi.The study employs a convergent mixed research methods design in which both quantitative and qualitative data were collected, analyzed, and interpreted.Our analysis reveals clear gender differences and preferences in crop traits and cropping systems. Male farmers prefer traits based on economic gains, notably yield and grain size. Female farmers target characteristics based on both agronomic and post-harvest grain characteristics to ensure the sustainability of household food intake. We also identify gender inequalities in decision-making regarding crop production practices and preferential access to knowledge in favor of male farmers.We show that gender norms and climate risk knowledge influence farmers' decision-making in selecting crop traits and practices, as well as accessibility to resources. Gendered inequality in decision-making goes beyond cropping practices to socially constructed rules of resource accessibility and restricted mobility. We conclude that efforts to improve crop adaptation and resilience to climate change in vulnerable dryland regions must pay greater attention to the processes and relations between gender and climate change knowledge bases.

To investigate this, we utilized the tree-ring chronology in the Loess Plateau of China to explore the changes in tree growth-climate relationships during these warming phases. Our findings indicate that tree growth rates primarily increased during the first warming phase (1910-1940) and decreased during the second phase (1970-2000). Furthermore, we observed that temperature was the main influencing factor for tree growth during the first phase, whereas drought played a more significant role during the second phase. These temporal changes emphasize the importance of water availability for tree growth in drylands and suggest that reductions in precipitation will further exacerbate the adverse effects of climate warming on tree growth.Abstract Ongoing climate warming poses significant threats to forest ecosystems, particularly in drylands. Here, we assess the intricate responses of tree growth to climate change across two warming phases (1910-1940 and 1970-2000) of the 20th century in the Loess Plateau of China. To achieve this, we analyzed a dataset encompassing 53 ring-width chronologies extracted from 13 diverse tree species, enabling us to discern and characterize the prevailing trends in tree growth over these warming phases. The difference in the primary contributors over two warming phases was compared to investigate the association of tree growth with climatic drivers. We found that the first warming phase exerted a stimulating effect on tree growth, with climate warming correlating to heightened growth rates. However, a contrasting pattern emerged in the second phase as accelerated drought conditions emerged as a predominant limiting factor, dampening tree growth rates. The response of tree growth to climate changed markedly during the two warming phases. Initially, temperature assumed a dominant role in driving the tree growth of growth season during the first warming phase. Instead, precipitation and drought stress became the main factors affecting tree growth in the second phase. This drought stress manifested predominantly during the early and late growing seasons. Our findings confirm the discernible transition of warming-induced tree growth in water-limited regions and highlight the vulnerability of dryland forests to the escalating dual challenges of heightened warming and drying. If the warming trend continues unabated in the Loess Plateau, further deterioration in tree growth and heightened mortality rates are foreseeable outcomes. Some adaptive forest managements should be encouraged to sustain the integrity and resilience of these vital ecosystems in the Loess Plateau and similar regions.																				2079-7737				OCT	2023	12	10							1275	10.3390/biology12101275	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology12101275								37886985					WOS:001089985300001

However, few studies have examined water supply and demand under multiple future spatial patterns of land use, particularly under sustainable development scenarios. Further research is therefore needed to determine how affect water output services under various land use patterns. We used the GMOP-PLUS (Gray Multi-objective Optimization-Patch-generating Land Use Simulation) and the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) models to investigate future land use programs and the current and future trends in water yield services supply and demand in the typical dryland region of Xinjiang, China. The GMOP-PLUS model was used to project the spatial patterns of land use/land cover (LULC) change in Xinjiang in 2025 and 2030 under programs of business-as-usual, rapid economic development, ecological land protection and sustainable development. We then used the InVEST model to project the spatiotemporal evolution of water yield services supply and demand under the four different scenarios. Our results show that Our results show that water production in Xinjiang decreases to 911.30 x 10(8) m(3) in 2020-2030 under the business-as-usual scenario, with an expansion in arable land and a reduction in forested land being the main causes of this decrease. The decline in water production under the ecological land protection scenario is 913.88 x 10(8) m(3). The retention effect of vegetation slows the decline in water production, but the ecological land protection scenario is not effective in controlling the reduction in arable land. The rapid economic development scenario produces a significant increase in water yield of 915.09 x 10(8) m(3), mainly due to an increase in the area of impervious surfaces caused by the expansion of built-up land; however, the rapid economic development scenario leads to a decreasing trend in ecological land. The sustainable development scenario produces 914.15 x 10(8) m(3) of water. The sustainable development scenario increases water production while balancing the development of Constructed and the protection of ecological land, and the arable land also shows a slow growth trend. Between 2025 and 2030, the water security index fluctuates between -0.0225 and -0.0400, with a continued future deficit in water supply and demand in Xinjiang and a high degree of spatial heterogeneity. Programs for advancing sustainable development narrow the supply-demand gap for services that produce water.					yang, xiao/JTQ-0214-2023	Dong, Tong/0000-0003-4035-3356; Liu, Zhuo/0000-0002-8495-7955													2296-701X					MAY 5	2023	11								1094409	10.3389/fevo.2023.1094409	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2023.1094409													WOS:000989452700001

Limited information, however, is available for the sources and dynamics of the eroded OM in bulk and soluble phases in relation to land-use types and rainfall events from an erosion prone landscape. In this study, we collected the top-soils from different land-uses and gully bank in uplands over seven rainfall events in 2016 to address this issue at two contrasting watersheds (with vs. without soil conservation measures) in the Loess hilly-gully region of China. Chemical compositions of eroded OM in bulk sediments and stream waters at the stream channels during rainfall processes were determined by spectroscopic analysis and source partition was inferred with the stable isotopic technique. Our results indicated that OM from forested soils had higher aromaticity, hydrophobic fraction, humification, molecular weight, and proportion of humic-like substance compared with other land-use types. The calculation with isotope mixing model indicated that the eroded bulk OM sources in sediments mainly originated from gully bank, orchard, and forests at the watershed coupled with soil conservation measures. Further, gully banks were the main contributor of eroded OM during rainfall events only at the watershed without conservation practices. Moreover, the principal component analysis suggested that the dissolved organic matter in stream waters were primarily derived from microbial OM sources (i.e. biological production of OM) in deep soils during rainfall events at both contrasting watersheds. Our findings highlight the effects of soil conservation measures and rainfall events on the nature and reactivity of eroded OM in various forms issuing from watersheds.

Theoretical and empirical models based on remote sensing data have been successfully applied to predict large-scale SWC. However, most existing models are limited to the surface soil layer, while the prediction of SWC in the deep soil layer (1-5 m) has been overlooked because of the shortage of long-term and large-scale filed-observed data. In this study, a south-north transect (ca. 860 km) was selected across the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). Based on both long-term remote sensing and in-situ data (2013-2016), pedo-transfer functions (PTFs) for the SWC in the 0-5 m profile were developed using multiple regression, random forest, and artificial neural network. The results showed that evapotranspiration, potential evapotranspiration, soil surface temper-ature, total shortwave broadband albedo, and normalized difference vegetation index were important remote sensing parameters, whereas soil texture and bulk density were important in-situ parameters for SWC PTFs development. Among the three PTF development methods, machine learning (i.e. random forest and artificial neural network) obtained a higher accuracy than multiple regression. For different combinations of input pa-rameters, the introduction of in-situ factors significantly improved the accuracy of PTFs compared with PTFs based on remote sensing data only. The artificial neural network developed a PTF with only five input variables that predicted SWC with reasonable accuracy (root mean square error symbolscript 0.039, R2 symbolscript 0.697, mean absolute percentage symbolscript 24.8) and is thus useful for many applications on the Loess Plateau of China. In the future, more attention should be given to the role of in-situ parameters when developing PTFs for deep SWC prediction.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				MAR	2023	222								106852	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106852	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106852		DEC 2022											WOS:000904324200001

Transforming livestock productivity through watershed interventions: A case study of Parasai-Sindh watershed in Bundelkhand region of Central India	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												CONTEXT: Global experiences reveal the positive impact of watershed-based interventions in improving livelihoods and environmental security. In the drylands, increasing forage resources and improving livestock productivity is a critical challenge. OBJECTIVES: The overarching aim of this paper is to analyse the impact of watershed-based interventions on livestock population, productivity, fodder resources, and biomass availability. The paper describes the interrelationship between land, water, crop, and livestock and how the gap in forage deficit can be bridged through a range of watershed interventions. METHODS: The study was undertaken in the Parasai-Sindh watershed of Central India between 2011 and 2016. A 300-year-old defunct haveli (a traditional rainwater harvesting structure) was renovated and nine check dams along the drainage line were constructed. Nearly 25,000 running-meters of field bunds were constructed. Large fields (2-3 ha) were divided into relatively smaller plots (0.3-0.5 ha) to reduce runoff velocity. The impact of watershed interventions on water availability, livestock productivity, forage yield, and income was studied through hydrological monitoring, primary household survey and principal component analysis (PCA) biplot and hierarchical clustering. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The watershed interventions enhanced groundwater availability leading to greater fodder availability, 22% increase in livestock population (ACU) and a 120% increase in milk production over a period of five years. The bovine population recorded a surge of 193% (cattle) and 32% (buffalo) over this period. Mean dry matter (DM, fodder) availability also increased from 10 t/household/year to 16.7 t/household/year owing to improved water availability. Groundnut (rainy season) and wheat (post rainy season) contributed significantly as forage resources. There was an annual forage demand of 5560 t DM for a livestock population of 2175 ACU in 2011 and of 6770 t DM for a livestock population of 2650 ACU in 2016. Annual forage biomass availability was estimated at 4219 t DM in 2011 and 6977 t DM in 2016. There was a deficit of 1341 t DM (24%) in 2011 which turned into a 3% surplus of 210 t DM in 2016 through watershed-based interventions. With increased cropping intensity and milk production, average annual household income increased from US$ 1325 to US$ 2430 over the five-year period. SIGNIFICANCE: This case study clearly illustrates the impact of watershed-based interventions on livestock population, productivity, forage resources, and biomass availability to bridge the gap in forage deficit. Its findings serve as a guide to widely scale up watershed-based interventions for improved water and biomass availability, and livestock productivity in semi-arid and dryland regions.

Soil physicochemical properties influenced by nitrogen sources and rates in the central Great Plains	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Land application of beef cattle (Bos turus) manure is a management strategy that can supply essential plant nutrients, enhance land sustainability, and maintain environmental quality. The objectives of this study were to evaluate (1) soil chemical properties and (2) temporal changes in soil nutrient dynamics as influenced by tillage practices (no-tillage [NT] and conventional tillage [CT]) and nitrogen (N) sources (manure and commercial fertilizer; urea) at two application rates (high 134 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) [120 lb ac(-1) yr(-1)] and low 67 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) [60 lb ac(-1) yr(-1)]) for both N sources. An unfertilized control treatment with no N added was also included within each tillage treatment. The study was conducted on an Armo silt loam (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Entic Haplustolls) at Kansas State University Agriculture Research Center near Hays, Kansas, from 2006 to 2016. Soil samples were taken annually at 0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in) depth prior to spring field operations. Across tillage, soil pH, total N (TN), extractable phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and sodium (Na) were influenced by N source, N rate, and sampling time. The high manure rate treatments increased soil TN by an average of 19% compared with the commercial N fertilizer and control treatments. Eliminating tillage enhanced soil TN accumulation in the top 15 cm of soil by approximately 9% more than CT. Extractable soil P measured in 2016 increased by approximately 401% compared with 2006. Similarly, soil P increased by approximately 331% with high manure and by 66% with low manure compared with commercial fertilizer treatments. Manure addition at high and low rates had 43% and 20% increase in soil available K, respectively, compared with commercial fertilizer treatments. The observed temporal variability in soil extractable P, K, and Na were mostly related to manure addition. The increase in N rates strengthens the relationship between soil electrical conductivity (EC) and soil nitrates (NO3), especially with commercial fertilizer where the changes in soil EC were 2.8-fold greater than the manure treatments. The significant (p < 0.05) changes in soil chemical properties influenced by the management interaction throughout the years (time x tillage x N sources) may take longer than 10 years to be observed in the dryland cropping system of the Great Plains region. However, growers should take extra care to prevent soil P and Na accumulation, specifically when cattle manure is being added to meet the N requirement for crop production.

The wheat accession CH1539 showed a high level of resistance to leaf rust. A mapping population of 184 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed from a cross between the resistant accession CH1539 and the susceptible cultivar SY95-71. The RILs showed segregating infection responses to Puccinia triticina Eriks. (Pt) race THK at the seedling stage. Genetic analysis showed that leaf rust resistance was controlled by a monogenic gene, and the potential locus was temporarily named LrCH1539. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) using a 35 K DArTseq array located LrCH1539 on the short arm of chromosome 2B. Subsequently, a genetic linkage map of LrCH1539 was constructed using the developed 2BS chromosome-specific markers, and its flanking markers were sxau-2BS136 and sxau-2BS81. An F-2 subpopulation with 3619 lines was constructed by crossing the resistant and susceptible lines selected from the RIL population. The inoculation identification results showed that LrCH1539 was recessively inherited and was fine-mapped to a 779.4-kb region between markers sxau-2BS47 and sxau-2BS255 at the end of 2BS. The linkage marker analysis showed that the positions of LrCH1539 and Lr16 were the same, but the identification results of the resistance spectrum indicated that the causal genes of the two might be different. The resistant materials reported in this study and the cosegregation marker can be used for marker-assisted selection breeding of leaf rust-resistant wheat cultivars.					zhang, luyu/JJC-4227-2023; cheng, cheng/JBR-8359-2023; Wang, Yiping/IZQ-2052-2023	Sheng, Dece/0000-0001-9249-5044													1380-3743	1572-9788				SEP	2022	42	9							52	10.1007/s11032-022-01318-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-022-01318-4								37313422					WOS:000847335000001

Their growth and survival depend on multiple environmental factors, including climatic ones, and the relations of these factors to physiological processes. Responses of biocrusts to individual environmental factors have been examined in a large number of field and laboratory experiments. These observational data, however, have rarely been assembled into a comprehensive, consistent framework that allows quantitative exploration of the roles of multiple environmental factors and physiological properties for the performance of biocrusts, in particular across climatic regions. Here we used a data-driven mechanistic modelling framework to simulate the carbon balance of biocrusts, a key measure of their growth and survival. We thereby assessed the relative importance of physiological and environmental factors for the carbon balance at six study sites that differ in climatic conditions. Moreover, we examined the role of seasonal acclimation of physiological properties using our framework, since the effects of this process on the carbon balance of biocrusts are poorly constrained so far. We found substantial effects of air temperature, CO2 concentration, and physiological parameters that are related to respiration on biocrust carbon balance, which differ, however, in their patterns across regions. The ambient CO2 concentration is the most important factor for biocrusts from drylands, while air temperature has the strongest impact at alpine and temperate sites. Metabolic respiration cost plays a more important role than optimum temperature for gross photosynthesis at the alpine site; this is not the case, however, in drylands and temperate regions. Moreover, we estimated a small annual carbon gain of 1.5 gm-2yr-1 by lichen-dominated biocrust and 1.9 gm-2yr-1 by moss-dominated biocrust at a dryland site, while the biocrusts lost a large amount of carbon at some of the temperate sites (e.g. -92.1 for lichen-dominated and -74.7 gm-2yr-1 for moss-dominated biocrust). These strongly negative values contradict the observed survival of the organisms at the sites and may be caused by the uncertainty in environmental conditions and physiological parameters, which we assessed in a sensitivity analysis. Another potential explanation for this result may be the lack of acclimation in the modelling approach, since the carbon balance can increase substantially when testing for seasonally varying parameters in the sensitivity analysis. We conclude that the uncertainties in air temperature, CO2 concentration, respiration-related physiological parameters, and the absence of seasonal acclimation in the model for humid temperate and alpine regions may be a relevant source of error and should be taken into account in future approaches that aim at estimating the long-term biocrust carbon balance based on ecophysiological data.					; Weber, Bettina/G-8316-2016	Porada, Philipp/0000-0002-5072-0220; Weber, Bettina/0000-0002-5453-3967; Veste, Maik/0000-0003-2704-2588; Ma, Yunyao/0000-0001-8711-8893													1726-4170	1726-4189				JUL 4	2023	20	13					2553	2572		10.5194/bg-20-2553-2023	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2553-2023													WOS:001022845700001

However, the effects of different maize parts on SOC fractions with different soil fertility levels in situ are not exactly clear. Therefore, an in situ field incubation experiment over 540 days, by adding different C-13-labeled maize parts (root, stem and leaf) into low- (no fertilizer treatment) and high- (manure treatment) fertility soils, was conducted at a long-term brown earth experimental site in Shenyang of China to figure out the effects of different maize parts on SOC fractions (dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC)). The results showed that the distribution-DOC ratio of low-fertility treatment was higher than that of high-fertility treatment in the period of rapid decomposition of straw. In both low- and high-fertility soils, the ratio of carbon to DOC in leaf residue was higher than that in root and stem residues. The proportion of root, stem and leaf residue converted to DOC in low-fertility soil was 4.51%, 3.89% and 5.00%, respectively. The proportion of root, stem and leaf residue converted to DOC in high-fertility soil was 4.10%, 3.65% and 4.11%, respectively. As for the distribution-POC ratio, during the period of rapid decomposition of straw, the ratio of carbon conversion from root and stem residue to POC was generally higher than that from leaf residue. The ratio of carbon conversion to POC of root, stem and leaf residues in high-fertility treatment was higher than that in low-fertility treatment. In low-fertility treatment, the proportion of root, stem and leaf residues converted to POC was 41.34%, 46.33% and 36.11%, respectively. The proportion of root, stem and leaf residue converted to POC in high-fertility soil was 46.48%, 44.45% and 41.14%, respectively. The results showed that, for DOC, a low fertility level and more leaf residue types were beneficial. While, for POC, root and stem residues with a high fertility level were beneficial. These results provide evidence that the addition of different parts of maize residues would have differing effects on DOC and POC. Leaf residues in low-fertility soils were more suitable for increasing DOC. Root and stem residues in high-fertility soils were more suitable for increasing POC. Nevertheless, we could not ignore the unmeasured SOC fractions that some of the residues could be converted to.																				2073-4395				APR	2023	13	4							1121	10.3390/agronomy13041121	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13041121													WOS:000979553600001

Understanding the vulnerability, farming strategies and development pathways of smallholder farming systems in Telangana, India	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT												Climate change projections for the 21st century indicate an increase in the already high number of food-insecure people in India. While considerable research on vulnerability to climate change exists, research about Indian smallholder farming systems as a whole, encompassing farming strategies and development pathways in this context, is limited. Hence, the current study examines the vulnerability of three smallholder farming systems, namely, (i) crop without livestock (CWL), (ii) crop with small ruminants (CSR), and (iii) crop with dairy (CD), in the context of climate change in Telangana, India. A mixed methods approach was used to conduct the research with a sample size of ten households per farming system. We found that households of different farming systems faced differential vulnerability due to variation in perceptions of climate change exposures, access to livelihood capitals, and the farming strategies they chose. The CWL households were highly vulnerable to increased maximum temperature and erratic rainfall, while households that farmed both crop and livestock were more vulnerable to overall reduction in precipitation. Decision-making related to farming strategies was a complex process involving several factors, of which the availability of livelihood capitals, provided by government programs, was the foremost. Due to this, households of the different farming systems pursued divergent farming strategies, leading to varying types of adaptation and climate change resilience. Among the three farming systems, the households in the CWL system had the least access to all livelihood capitals and showed the highest vulnerability as their farm strategies only helped to cope with immediate needs. The households in the CD system had access to all critical livelihood capitals, which facilitated opting for sustainable farming strategies. However, as these households were highly dependent on scarce ground water resources for production, their strategies helped only short-term adaption. The households in the CSR system, despite having access to limited capitals, adopted long-term adaptation strategies which is attributed to them being a pastoral ethnic group. Lastly, despite the existence of an integrated climate change policy, state-level development programs continue to focus more on agricultural intensification than on climate change adaptation. This stimulates farming strategies that are lucrative in the short term but endanger farming system resilience to climate change in the long term. We therefore recommend policy makers to give high priority to climate smart development in state development programs, and science-based evaluations of these programs to enable proper climate change adaptation in dryland regions that is inclusive of perspectives of different populations.

Root System under Drought and Rehydration Regimes	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Alfalfa (Medicago sativaL.) is a nutritious forage plant in dryland regions with strong drought tolerance and broad adaptability. To understand the architectural characters and physiological functions of the root systems in response to different drought stress and rehydration, two experiments were conducted in a glasshouse. Experiment 1 used three alfalfa cultivars and four soil moisture treatments in a split-plot design with four replicates to investigate the response of root systems of different alfalfa cultivars to drought stress and subsequent rehydration. Experiment 2 used one alfalfa cultivar and four soil moisture treatments in a randomized complete block (RCB) design with three replicates to measure reactive oxidant species and antioxidant defense systems of alfalfa root. The soil moisture treatments included (1) 75-80% of the water-holding capacity (CK); (2) 60-65% of the water-holding capacity and subsequent rehydration to 75-80% of the water-holding capacity; (3) 45-50% of the water-holding capacity and subsequent rehydration to 60-65% and 75-80% of the water-holding capacity; and (4) 30-35% of the water-holding capacity and subsequent rehydration to 45-50%, 60-65% and 75-80% of the water-holding capacity. Our results demonstrated that plants had higher root biomasses (mean = 0.77 g), fractal dimensions (1.47), fractal abundances (3.84), and branching ratios (0.39) under severe water deficit and rehydration than under less stressful soil moisture conditions. Plant root systems tended to exhibit herringbone branching (Topological Index = 0.63) when soil moisture was at 60-65% water-holding capacity with the soil being then rehydrated, whereas they tended to have a smaller lateral root length, root surface area, root volume, and branching ratio and larger root diameter under more favorable soil moisture conditions for less stressful soil moisture treatments. Severe water stress and subsequent considerably improved superoxide (O-2(-)) generation rate, the content of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and Malondialdehyde (MDA), and non-enzyme antioxidant glutathione (GSH), and reduced the content of ascorbate (AsA) and activity of catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX). It is concluded thatMedicago sativaL. cv Zhaodong (ZD) and cv Aohan (AH) exhibited higher drought resistances than cv Golden empress (GE) using topological and fractal analyses. This could be a key contributor to altering optimum soil moisture conditions and screening alfalfa cultivars based on root system architecture and antioxidant defense systems. The molecular functions warrant further investigation which could help explain the observed root phenotypes after drought conditions and rehydration.																				2073-4395				JUN	2020	10	6							805	10.3390/agronomy10060805	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10060805													WOS:000551182900001

In this study, a method using a wake model to predict the flow field and the output power of each rotor in a VAWT cluster is proposed. The method uses the information obtained by the preliminary computational fluid dynamics (CFD) targeting an isolated single two-dimensional (2D) VAWT rotor and a few layouts of the paired 2D rotors. In the method, the resultant rotor and flow conditions are determined so as to satisfy the momentum balance in the main wind direction. The pressure loss of the control volume (CV) is given by an interaction model which modifies the prepared information on a single rotor case and assumes the dependence on the inter-rotor distance and the induced velocity. The interaction model consists of four equations depending on the typical four-type layouts of selected two rotors. To obtain the appropriate circulation of each rotor, the searching range of the circulation is limited according to the distribution of other rotors around the rotor at issue. The method can predict the rotor powers in a 2D-VAWT cluster including a few rotors in an incomparably shorter time than the CFD analysis using a dynamic model.					; Hara, Yutaka/D-3572-2019	Jodai, Yoshifumi/0000-0002-3824-2887; Hara, Yutaka/0000-0002-3037-2468; Furukawa, Masaru/0000-0002-8256-9596														1996-1073				JUL	2022	15	14							5200	10.3390/en15145200	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15145200													WOS:000831377900001

Need for a holistic approach to food systems is becoming crucial in designing policies that support the transition to sustainable and healthy diets. The present study is aimed to understand the rural food environment in the Telangana state in southern India by analyzing the combination of external and personal factors affecting food choices, attitudes, and consumption behavior. We developed a scoring-based methodology to assess the external and personal domains and di-mensions to understand the food environment. The results showed that rural households favored carbohydrate-rich food groups obtained mostly from their own production or subsidized sources. On the other hand, protein and micronutrient-rich food groups were neglected due to affordability and preference for taste, cultural factors, and the limitations of external food environment. The findings of this study provide a deeper understanding of the food environment in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) conext. By highlighting the interplay between agriculture, food environments, and nutrition outcomes, this study contributes to the ongoing effort to address the global malnutrition crisis and support the development of healthier and more sustainable food systems. These findings can be useful to guide policy actions towards achieving food security and nutrition in the rural regions where food environments are under rapid transitions in the LMICs.

Competition and facilitation are two common biotic predictors of success in plant communities. Abiotic limitations can include, but are not limited to, space, light, and water. Concurrent examination of spatial ecology of biotic and abiotic drivers with these interactions is critical to better understand plant invasion. Here, we test the relative importance of seed aggregation on the net outcome of interactions between a native desert annual Phacelia tanacetifolia and an invasive exotic species Bromus rubens. Our study proposes that seed aggregation can play a major role in determining whether an exotic species will co-exist or outcompete natives. We tested the ecological heteromyopia hypothesis that proposes interspecific competition is greater over shorter distances relative to intraspecific competition and that distance between species can thus lead to co-existence. We used competition trials with seeds and mimic plants via clumped and dispersed arrangements to test this hypothesis for one invasive and one native annual species. Monoculture and mixed seed trials were done under controlled greenhouse conditions for both species. To ensure findings that were not solely driven by physical interference or space constraints in pots, a plastic exotic mimic plant was used in a mixture treatment with natives to enable a contrast between biotic competition and space effects. Both P. tanacetifolia and B. rubens has significantly greater establishment and final abundances in monocultures with spatially clumped seeds. Dispersed seeds of B. rubens in monocultures had significantly lower establishment than the clumped sowing. Bromus rubens experienced a significant negative response to P. tanacetifolia in mixtures of clumped seeds. Additionally, the biomass of B. rubens was significantly higher in monocultures of clumped arrangement and mixtures of dispersed arrangement. The native P. tanacetifolia did not respond to the physical interference of the 3-D-printed plastic mimic brome invader. Light was also not a significant covariate in any of the competition trials. This pilot study suggests that seed aggregation is a potential key predictor of success for both the native and exotic species studied here in monocultures. Thus, the heteromyopia hypothesis was supported for these two dryland annual plant species because interspecific competition decreased as space and thus distance between individuals increased. This study highlights the importance of spatial structure of seeds in the seedbanks and seedlings in the emergent plant community in describing potential community assembly. Restoration efforts can consider seed sowing designs to decrease invasion by exotic species and increase native plant abundance by aggregating seeds at fine spatial scales.						lortie, cj/0000-0002-4291-7023; Owen, Malory/0000-0002-9931-4522; Braun, Jenna/0000-0003-2359-1838; Ghazian, Nargol/0000-0002-9710-7140													1585-8553	1588-2756				OCT	2021	22	3					403	412		10.1007/s42974-021-00064-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42974-021-00064-5		NOV 2021											WOS:000719153300001

Our study aimed to investigate the influences of season and slope aspect on the water use patterns of Caragana korshinskii on typical shady and sunny slopes on the Loess Plateau in China. We collected xylem water, soil water from the 0-200 cm soil layers, and precipitation in May, July, September and November 2018 and measured their hydrogen (delta D) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotope compositions. The root distribution of C. korshinskii in the 0-200 cm soil layer on both slopes was also investigated. The 0-20, 20-80, and 80-200 cm soil layers were identified as three potential water sources for C. korshinskii, and their proportional contributions to the plant water supply were calculated using a linear mixed model. The results showed that C. korshinskii on the sunny slope absorbed 89.3% of their water from the 0-20 cm soil layer in May but mainly utilized water from the 0-20 and 20-80 cm soil layers in both July and September, and the total contribution percentages of these layers were 84.5% and 89.2%, respectively. However, C. korshinskii on the shady slope extracted water evenly from all three soil layers in May. Thereafter, the plants absorbed water from the 20-80 and 80-200 cm soil layers in both July and September, and the total contribution percentages of these layers were 96.0% and 91.8%, respectively. In November, C. korshinskii absorbed 84.8% and 78.0% of their water from the 80-200 cm soil layer on the shady and sunny slopes, respectively. The generally shallower soil water use of C. korshinskii on the sunny slope than on the shady slope may be due to the larger fine-root (d < 2 mm) length density in the 0-80 cm soil layer on the sunny slope (1.12 +/- 0.28 mm/cm(3)) than on the shady slope (0.57 +/- 0.16 mm/mm(3)) (P < 0.05). This study indicates that C. korshinskii on both shady and sunny slopes seasonally switched their water sources from different soil water layers during the growing season. However, due to their reliance on soil water at the 0-20 cm depth, which is supplied by unstable rainfall, C. korshinskii on sunny slopes may be more vulnerable to future climatic warming and drying on the Loess Plateau. Our findings provide valuable information related to optimal water management in the afforested shrublands in this region.

We herein assessed the replication competence of strains obtained from individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy. Among 11 306 participants in a drug resistance surveillance in the Philippines, 2629 plasma samples were obtained from individuals after a 12-month treatment with zidovudine (ZDV)/lamivudine (3TC)/nevirapine (NVP). The replication competence of HIV isolates was then assessed by reinoculation into seronegative peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the absence of drugs in vitro. The drug resistance rate was estimated to be 9.2%. Drug-resistant strains were still a minority of closely related strains in a phylogenetic cluster. Among the available 295 samples, 37 HIV strains were successfully isolated. Progeny viruses were produced at a wide range (5.1 x 10(6) to 3.4 x 10(9) copies/mL) in primary culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The viral yields were higher than the corresponding plasma viral load (1300 to 3.4 x 10(6) copies/mL) but correlated with those (r = 0.4). These results suggest that strains with higher intrinsic replication competence are one of the primary targets of newly selected drugs at the increasing phase of the plasma viral load during antiretroviral therapy.

ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Spatiotemporal quantification of surface water and flooding is essential given that floods are among the largest natural hazards. Effective disaster response management requires near real-time information on flood extent. Satellite remote sensing is the only way of monitoring these dynamics across vast areas and over time. Previous water and flood mapping efforts have relied on optical time series, despite cloud contamination. This reliance on optical data is due to the availability of systematically acquired and easily accessible optical data globally for over 40 years. Prior research used either MODIS or Landsat data, trading either high temporal density but lower spatial resolution or lower cadence but higher spatial resolution. Both MODIS and Landsat pose limitations as Landsat can miss ephemeral floods, whereas MODIS misses small floods and inaccurately delineates flood edges. Leveraging high temporal frequency of 3-4 days of the existing Landsat-8 (L8) and two Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites combined, in this research, we assessed whether the increased temporal frequency of the three sensors improves our ability to detect surface water and flooding extent compared to a single sensor (L8 alone). Our study area was Australia's Murray-Darling Basin, one of the world's largest dryland basins that experiences ephemeral floods. We applied machine learning to NASA's Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) Surface Reflectance Product, which combines L8 and S2 observations, to map surface water and flooding dynamics. Our overall accuracy, estimated from a stratified random sample, was 99%. Our user's and producer's accuracy for the water class was 80% (& PLUSMN;3.6%, standard error) and 76% (& PLUSMN;5.8%). We focused on 2019, one of the most recent years when all three HLS sensors operated at full capacity. Our results show that water area (permanent and flooding) identified with the HLS was greater than that identified by L8, and some short-lived flooding events were detected only by the HLS. Comparison with high resolution (3 m) PlanetScope data identified extensive mixed pixels at the 30 m HLS resolution, highlighting the need for improved spatial resolution in future work. The HLS has been able to detect floods in cases when one sensor (L8) alone was not, despite 2019 being one of the driest years in the area, with few flooding events. The dense optical time-series offered by the HLS data is thus critical for capturing temporally dynamic phenomena (i.e., ephemeral floods in drylands), highlighting the importance of harmonized data such as the HLS.

It is therefore critical to investigate the relationship between land-use change and soil quality parameters to offer a scientific basis for optimizing land-use planning and improving soil quality status in dry ecosystems and ecologically vulnerable areas. This study, therefore, analyzed the physicochemical properties of soils in five different land-use types namely farmland, abandoned farmland, natural grassland, artificial lemon forest, and poplar woodland at YongDeng County. The soil quality status of the aforementioned land-use types was also evaluated through Principal component analysis. The results revealed that abandoned farmland and natural grassland recorded the highest average values of soil coarse particles of 24.0% and 23.4% respectively compared to the other land-use types. The highest average value (46.1%) of fine soil particles was recorded in poplar woodland followed by natural grassland (36.6%) and the average value of very fine soil particles was higher in farmland (40.8%) and artificial lemon woodland (38.3%) than in the other land-use types. The average value of clayey particles was highest in farmland (11.1%), followed by artificial lemon woodland (9.3%), and abandoned farmland (6.5%), then poplar woodland which recorded an average value of (4.2%). The average values of Soil water content, soil pH, soil electrical conductivity, and soil total nitrogen content were significantly higher in farmland compared to the other land-use types. Soil organic carbon content was significantly higher in abandoned farmland at (P < 0.03) and lemon woodland at (P < 0.01) than in farmlands, natural grasslands, and poplar stands. The soil quality indicators of the different land-use types were significantly correlated with each other. Among them, the correlation coefficient of each evaluation index was highest in poplar woodland, followed by natural grassland, lower in farmland and artificial lemon woodland, and lowest in abandoned farmland. The overall soil quality scores were in the following order: farmland > abandoned farmland > 0 > grassland > lemon woodland > poplar woodland. In the study area, the soil quality of farmland that has been finely managed and naturally restored to grassland following abandonment is superior, whereas the soil quality of natural grassland, artificial lemon woodland, and poplar forest land is substandard. The comprehensive analysis of soil quality demonstrates that conservation tillage and fine management of water-irrigated farmland, as well as the natural conversion of abandoned farmland to grassland, can significantly improve the soil quality of sandy soils, reduce water and soil loss, increase fertility, and gradually improve regional ecological environmental conditions.

The wheat straw stem cutting capacity of the device was evaluated under controlled laboratory conditions at the University of South Australia, using a purpose-made straw holding tray moving at a controlled speed under the path of a stationary UHP nozzle. The impacts of technology settings and straw conditions were measured. The cutting performance was assessed based on the degree of fully cut straw stems, integrating the extent of partially cut stems, from a quantity calibrated to an equivalent dry stem load in Mg/ha. Results showed that when operated at 380 MPa pressure, the device delivered very high cutting capacity of wheat straw stems of 10-35 Mg/ha across the range of nozzle orifice diameters (0.15-0.3 mm) and forward speeds (6-12 km/h) tested. The UHP waterjet cutting unit was found to operate most effectively when the residue was wet and placed under compression. Halving travel speed increased the cutting capacity by an average 12 % indicating a non-linear impact of speed. No effect of nozzle to target distance could be detected over the 5-70 mm range tested. The cutting performance of wet, compressed residue was mapped against the water volume rate required over a range of speeds and orifice diameters. Correction factors for extending cutting performance estimations to dry and/or loose residue conditions were also determined. Across the range of nozzle orifice diameters and speeds investigated, the laboratory data for wet compressed residue indicate that a nominal 150 L/ha volume of water, deemed acceptable under Australian dryland cropping conditions, could provide straw stem cutting capacities of up to 12.5 Mg/ha, 19 Mg/ha and 35 Mg/ha at 300 mm, 500 mm and 1000 mm nozzle row spacing, respectively, at a nominal 380 MPa operating pressure. In this study, the waterjet technology demonstrated very effective residue cutting, which could be maximised under specific residue conditions and technology settings. The results indicate that the technology could become an effective tool for assisting residue handling in no-till planting applications, particularly in wet stubble and soft soil environments where traditional mechanical coulters fail. Further research is required to develop accurate operational guidelines for a range of field residue type and conditions, as well as clarify the technology cost-effectiveness in order to facilitate adoption within the no-till cropping industry.

This study aimed to investigate the yield response of mungbean cultivars to different water stress and temperature regimes under controlled glasshouse conditions. Two mungbean cultivars, Celera II-AU and Jade-AU, were grown and evaluated under four temperature regimes with and without water stress, each replicated 10 times in a randomized complete block design. The four temperature regimes were as follows: (i) HTHT: Plants were consistently exposed to high day/high night temperatures (35/25 degrees C). (ii) LTHT: Plants experienced ambient day/ambient night temperatures (25/15 degrees C) for the first 35 days, followed by the HTHT environment. (iii) LTLT: Plants were maintained at ambient day/ambient night temperatures (25/15 degrees C) throughout the experiment. (iv) HTLT: Plants were subjected to high day/high night temperatures (35/25 degrees C) for the initial 35 days, followed by the LTLT environment. Under water stress conditions, mungbean yield declined significantly in the HTHT environment by 57% for Jade-AU and 76% for Celera II-AU compared to the LTLT environment. The highest seed yield (10.2 g plant(-1) for Jade-AU and 11.4 g plant(-1) for Celera II-AU) for both cultivars was observed when grown without water stress in the LTLT environment. However, yield decreased substantially when plants experienced combined heat and water stress during the reproductive stage (HTHT and LTHT environments). Without water stress, mungbean yield under the HTHT environment decreased by 30% for Jade-AU and 60% for Celera II-AU compared to the LTLT environment. Surprisingly, no significant difference in response to water stress was observed between the two cultivars. Furthermore, when grown under no-water stress and HTHT environments, the yield of Celera II-AU was reduced by 37% compared to Jade-AU. Similarly, a comparable response was seen between cultivars under no-water stress and LTHT environment. The results indicated that water and heat stress negatively affected mungbean seed yield. Moreover, it was observed that Jade-AU outperformed Celera II-AU regarding seed yield under heat-stress conditions. In conclusion, this study suggests that adjusting sowing time and selecting suitable heat-tolerant cultivars, such as Jade-AU, could enhance mungbean yield under heat and water stress conditions. The results demonstrate substantial impacts on mungbean productivity from changing climatic and water stress conditions and these findings can be utilized for improving mungbean productivity in dryland regions.																				2073-4395				OCT	2023	13	10							2546	10.3390/agronomy13102546	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13102546													WOS:001093375200001

The Determinants and Effects of Chronic Pain Stigma: A Mixed Methods Study and the Development of a Model	JOURNAL OF PAIN												People with chronic pain report experiencing stigma, but few studies have explored this in detail. This mixed-methods study aimed to investigate factors that contribute to chronic pain stigma, the effects of stigma, and to explore the stigma experiences of people with chronic pain. Participants were 215 adults with chronic pain who completed questionnaires assessing chronic pain stigma, opioid use, mental health conditions, pain, depression, disability and social support, and 179 also answered open-ended questions about stigma experiences. Linear regres-sion and path analysis showed that greater stigma was experienced by those who used more opioids, had a mental health condition, viewed their pain as organic, and were unemployed. Stigma was associated with greater disability, depression and lower social support. Qualitative results supported quantitative findings, with 3 themes: 1. "Faking It" : Others disbelieve pain and attribute it to drug seeking, laziness, or mental health problems, 2. A spectrum of stigma: Experiences of stigma vary from none to widespread, and 3. "I hide it well": Concealing pain and avoiding stigmatizing situations lead to isolation & disability. This study demonstrates the negative influence of stigma and presents a novel integrated model of chronic pain stigma which may be used to develop interventions.Perspective: This study demonstrates the contributors to, and negative effects of, stigma for peo-ple with chronic pain. It presents an integrated model which could guide strategies to reduce chronic pain stigma amongst health professionals and the public, and to reduce self-stigma amongst people with pain.(c) 2022 by United States Association for the Study of Pain, Inc.

It is commonly applied as partial-film mulch (PM: at least 50% soil cover) or full-film mulch (FM: complete soil cover). The PM has lower economic and environmental cost; hence it would be a superior technology provided it delivers similar gains in yield and WUE in relation to FM. RESULTS To solve contradictory results from individual studies, we compared FM and PM in a meta-analysis of 100 studies with 1881 comparisons (685 for wheat; 1196 for maize). Compared with bare ground, FM and PM both increased yield of wheat (20-26%) and maize (37-52%), and WUE of wheat (16-20%) and maize (38-48%), with statistically undistinguishable differences between PM and FM. The increases in crop yield and WUE were stronger at elevation > 1000 m, with annual precipitation<400 mm, and on loess soil, especially for maize. CONCLUSIONS We concluded that partial-film mulch could replace full-film mulch to return similar yield and WUE improvement, with reduced cost and environmental pollution.

Organic and inorganic soil carbon in a semi-arid rangeland is primarily related to abiotic factors and not livestock grazing	GEODERMA												Soil has the ability to sequester carbon (C) and mitigate anthropogenic enrichment of carbon dioxide, however numerous variables influence its C storage potential. Climate, soil properties, plant species composition, and livestock management practices, may all influence C storage in rangeland soils. The purpose of this study was to examine the relative importance of these factors in predicting organic and inorganic soil C in a semi-arid rangeland in northern Arizona USA. Sampling sites at 60 locations within the 40,469 ha Diablo Trust Ranches were selected using a stratified random method to encompass five distinct soil series across a precipitation gradient (230 mm-623 mm mean annual precipitation) with fence-lines that separate actively grazed areas with adjacent areas that have excluded livestock for at least 20 years. A total of 240 soil samples were collected from two depths (0-5 cm and 20-25 cm) in grazed and adjacent ungrazed sides of fences. Soil texture, bulk density, plant community composition, root biomass, soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) were measured. Across the precipitation and soil gradient, SOC was highest (up to 28.6 Mg ha(-1)) in the surface layer of clay-rich soil derived from basalt and SIC was highest (up to 74.7 Mg ha(-1)) in subsurface soil derived from limestone. General linear models showed that grazing had no significant impact on total soil C, instead, soil depth and soil texture were the main predictors of SOC and SIC. Precipitation was positively correlated with SOC and negatively correlated with SIC. Soil texture and precipitation were highly autocorrelated, so only soil texture was included in structural equation models (SEMs). Separate SEMs for surface and subsurface soils showed that soil texture (and autocorrelated precipitation) was the strongest predictor of SOC, SIC and plant community composition at both soil depths. The relative abundance of C4 grasses was higher in grazed plots and was positively correlated with root biomass at the soil surface. Also, surface root biomass was weakly positively related to SOC while both surface and subsurface roots were negatively related to SIC. This study shows the importance of interactions among multiple factors in predicting soil C stocks and that SIC can be a substantial C reservoir in dryland soils, especially those derived from sedimentary parent material. We could not detect an influence of livestock grazing on either SOC or SIC in this landscape scale study. This suggests that in this semi-arid rangeland it may be difficult to increase total soil C storage through livestock management.

J	Miralles, I; Trasar-Cepeda, C; Soria, R; Ortega, R; Lucas-Borja, ME				Miralles, Isabel; Trasar-Cepeda, Carmen; Soria, Rocio; Ortega, Raul; Lucas-Borja, Manuel Esteban			Environmental and ecological factors influencing soil functionality of biologically crusted soils by different lichen species in drylands	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Biocrusts are an essential soil surface cover at drylands where ecosystems are especially fragile to soil degradation processes due to climatic peculiarities. In the present work, (micro)biological and physicochemical properties indicative of soil functionality were studied in two different biocrust types dominated by Dipolschistes diacapsis and Lepraria isidiata and in underlying soil at two different depths (SL1, soil layer right below the biocrusts, and SL2, soil layer underlying SL1) at the Tabernas desert (southeast Spain). The influence of climatic factors (rainfall and temperature) and general soil properties on the (micro)biological properties were also analyzed in different environmental (climatic) conditions over a period of two years. PERMANOVA analyses showed significant statistical differences (Pseudo-F = 63.9; P (perm) = 0.001) among biocrust and soil layers. Throughout the study period, enzyme activities involved in C, N, and P cycles; microbial biomass-C; basal respiration; and several properties directly related to ecosystem productivity (total organic carbon, total nitrogen, concentration of ammonium and nitrate) were higher in both biocrust types than in the underlying soil layers, showing that biocrusts improved soil functions related to nutrient cycling. These properties progressively diminished in successive soil layers under the biocrusts (biocrusts > SL1 > SL2). Biocrusts showed greater similarity to each other and to SL1 than to SL2 in (micro)biological properties. A distance-based linear model analysis showed that total organic carbon, rainfall, pH, mineralized NNH4+, and total nitrogen were the most important variables for predicting (micro)biological soil properties in biocrusts. Different biochemical behavior between the biocrusts and successive underlying soil layers has been found in wet periods. After rainfall periods, the biocrusts showed important peaks in basal soil respiration and in enzyme activities involved in C and P cycles. Nevertheless, soil biochemical properties hardly showed any peak in SL1 and did not change in SL2 despite soil moisture being higher in the soil layers below the biocrusts. Correlation analyses corroborated the existence of different relationships between soil moisture and enzymatic activities. In biocrusts, soil moisture showed a greater number of significant positive correlations with enzymes such as beta-glucosidase, invertase, and phosphomonoesterase among others, whereas in SL1 it was only correlated with cellulase and in SL2 with dehydrogenase. A change in rainfall regime, as predicted by models based on climate change in arid and semiarid zones, could affect the activity of soil enzymes in the biocrusts and underlying layers, thus aggravating the degradation of these fragile dryland ecosystems.

In the phosphatase activity determination, a fixed buffer value (pH 5-10) is commonly used for all soils, ignoring the soil's actual pH. Here, we determined the soil phosphatase activity of 20 soils under As stress at the soils' pH, and the As inhibition mechanism was also explored by the enzyme kinetics. Our results show that soil phosphatase activity was significantly inhibited under As stress. The inhibition rate in acid soils (39.2 %) was considerably higher than in alkaline soils (25.4 %) when As concentration was 600 mg kg(-1). For alkaline soils, As inhibited phosphatase by competitive inhibition or linearmixed inhibition, while for acid soils, it was more complex, including linear mixed inhibition, non-competitive inhibition, and anti-competitive inhibition. Simultaneously, our results showed that the ecological dose (ED10) described by the partial inhibition model was far below than the complete inhibition model. According to the partial inhibition model, the ED10 of As ranged from 2.66 to 164.07 mg kg(-1) for alkaline soils and 0.11 to 89.95 mg kg(-1) for acid soils. Moreover, V-max/K-m of phosphatase is a more sensitive index for evaluating As contamination than Vmax in partial inhibition models. The ED10 obtained based on the relationship between Vmax/Km and As concentration was 0.64-34.75 mg kg(-1) for acid soils and 8.48 to 20.16 mg kg(-1) for alkaline soils. This also confirms V-max/K-m as a sensitive and ideal index for assessing As pollution under soils' actual pH. Furthermore, soil pH and cation exchange capacity are dominant factors affecting As inhibition on soil phosphatase. The above kinetic studies indicate that performing the assay by adjusting the buffer pH to the soil pH is essential for more accurately evaluating arsenic toxicity.					wang, ziqi/IQS-5011-2023; Mallavarapu, Megharaj/D-3408-2011	Mallavarapu, Megharaj/0000-0002-6230-518X													0048-9697	1879-1026				FEB 10	2023	859		1						160184	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160184	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160184		NOV 2022						36395829					WOS:000898641100001

Biodegradable plastic films show potential as sustainable alternatives that could reduce microplastic soil contamination and accumulation. However, the effects of traditional and biodegradable microplastics on soil organic matter (SOM) stability are not sufficiently understood, particularly under varying temperatures. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of polyethylene (PE) and biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) microplastics on SOM stability and bacterial community in two contrasting soils (Black soil vs. Loess soil) under varying temperature conditions (15 ? vs. 25 ?). Results showed that microplastics addition significantly enhanced cumulative CO2 emissions and DOC contents, particularly 1 % PLA treatment accelerated CO2 emissions by 19 % - 74 %, DOC content by 3 % - 23 % at 25 ?. A higher temperature sensitivity (Q10) at the PLA treatment indicated that PLA is more susceptible to elevated temperature compared to PE. The presence of both PE and PLA microplastics significantly changed the DOC spectral characteristics, i.e., high temperature increased the value of the specific UV absorbance (SUVA) in soil without microplastics, while decreased it in soil with microplastics. In comparison to soil without microplastics, soil exposed to 1 % microplastics had lower MBC concentrations and greater metabolic quotient. 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that the presence of PLA microplastic significantly alters soil bacterial community. PE and CK had similar Bray-Curtis distances between two temperatures, while PLA increased the dissimilarity between CK compared to PE. Compared to the two soils, loess soil is more sensitive to microplastics addition. Microplastics have a non-ignorable effect on soil organic matter stability, the interaction between microplastics and soil environment should be considered.					wu, yunhui/JGD-6838-2023; Shang, jianying/E-3787-2013; lin, qing/JED-5250-2023; Wang, lingyu/JLM-2013-2023; li, bo/JJC-2664-2023; wang, chen/JED-7289-2023	Shang, jianying/0000-0002-2498-9699; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				SEP 10	2022	838		3						156471	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156471	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156471		JUN 2022						35660606					WOS:000816988600007
J	Odongo, RA; De Moel, H; Van Loon, AF				Odongo, Rhoda A.; De Moel, Hans; Van Loon, Anne F.			Propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought in the Horn ofAfrica using both standardized and threshold-based indices	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												There have been numerous drought propagation studies in data-rich countries, but not much has been done for data-poor regions (such as the Horn of Africa, HOA). In this study, we characterize meteorological, soil moisture and hydrological drought and the propagation from one to the other for 318 catchments in the HOA to improve understanding of the spatial variability in the drought hazard. We calculate the standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized soil moisture index (SSMI) and standardized streamflow index (SSI). In addition, we use the variable threshold method to calculate the duration of drought below a predefined percentile threshold for precipitation, soil moisture and discharge. The relationship between meteorological and soil moisture drought is investigated by finding the SPI accumulation period that has the highest correlation between SPI and SSMI, and the relationship between meteorological and hydrological drought is analysed by the SPI accumulation period that has the highest correlation between SPI and SSI time series. Additionally, we calculated these relationships with the ratio between the threshold-based meteorological-drought duration and soil moisture drought duration and the relation between threshold-based meteorological-drought duration and streamflow drought duration. Finally, we investigate the influence of climate and catchment characteristics on these propagation metrics. The results show that (1) the propagation from SPI to SSMI and the mean drought duration ratio of meteorological to soil moisture drought (P / SM) are mainly influenced by soil properties and vegetation, with the short accumulation periods (1 to 4 months) of SPI in catchments with arable land, high mean annual precipitation, and low sand and silt content, while longer accumulations (5 to 7 months) are in catchments with low mean annual upstream precipitation and shrub vegetation; (2) the propagation from SPI to SSI and precipitation-to-streamflow duration ratio are highly influenced by the climate and catchment control, i.e. geology, elevation and land cover, with the short accumulation times in catchments with high annual precipitation, volcanic permeable geology and cropland and the longer accumulations in catchments with low annual precipitation, sedimentary rocks and shrubland; and (3) the influence of mean annual upstream precipitation is more important for the propagation from SPI to SSI than from SPI to SSMI. Additionally, precipitation accumulation periods of approximately 1 to 4 months in wet western areas of the HOA and of approximately 5 to 7 months in the dryland regions are found. This can guide forecasting and management efforts as different drought metrics are thus of importance in different regions.

J	Dou, YX; Yang, Y; An, SS; Zhu, ZL				Dou, Yanxing; Yang, Yang; An, Shaoshan; Zhu, Zhaolong			Effects of different vegetation restoration measures on soil aggregate stability and erodibility on the Loess Plateau, China	CATENA												Vegetation restoration may affect soil aggregate stability and the ability of soil to resist erosion. To evaluate the influence of vegetation restoration measures on the stability of soil aggregate and soil erodibility, we chose 7 types of vegetation restoration measures, which included artificial forest (AF), artificial mixed forest (AMF), economic forest (EF), artificial shrub (AS), natural shrub (NS), artificial grass (AG) and natural grass (NG). Then, we analyzed the distribution of water-stable aggregate fractions, mean weight diameter (MWD), geometric mean diameter (GMD), soil erodibility (K value) and other soil properties in the 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm soil layers, as well as aboveground and underground biomass (AGB and UGB). The results showed that under 7 kinds of vegetation restoration measures, the aggregate fraction < 0.25 mm was the main component (40.40-77.86%) and the proportion of the > 5 mm aggregates fluctuated greatly and ranged from 1.87% to 32.50%. And for 7 different vegetation restoration measures, the percentage of aggregate < 0.25 mm was lower than that of CK (abandoned land), however, the proportion of aggregate > 5 mm was higher than the CK. Overall, compared with CK, the MWD (2.22 and 1.93 mm) and GMD (2.86 and 2.66 mm) were both highest in two soil layers under the NS but lowest under the EF (MWD 0.68 and 0.49 mm, GMD 1.08 and 0.93 mm). The trend of the K value was opposite to these values. These results indicated that the stability of soil aggregate and the ability of soil to resist erosion under NS were strongest. The soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and UGB had significantly positive correlations with the proportion of > 1 mm aggregates and MWD but had negative correlations with the percentage of < 0.25 mm aggregates (p < 0.05), which indicated that SOC, TN and UGB were involved in the formation of macroaggregates and increased the stability of soil aggregates. These results suggested that natural shrub restoration measures could improve the soil aggregate stability and ability to resist erosion better than forest and grass restoration measures, which can provide a reference for the assessment of vegetation restoration measures.

Understanding the relationship between SWR and volumetric soil water content (theta) is critical for predicting hydrological processes in hydrophobic soils. In this study, water droplet penetration time (WDPT) was used to investigate the SWR persistence (SWRP) in three soil types with contrasting drainage levels, namely a well-drained Lismore (LIS) stony silt loam, a moderately well-drained Templeton (TEM) silt loam, and a poorly drained Waterton/Temuka (WAT) clay loam under three long-term (>20 years) land uses (irrigated pasture [IP], dryland pasture [DP], and irrigated crop [IC]) in Canterbury, New Zealand. The three soils belong to different soil orders (i.e., Brown, Pallic, and Gley, respectively) in the New Zealand soil classification. Within each land use, 9, 12, and 9 sites were sampled in the LIS, TEM, and WAT soils respectively. There was strong evidence of SWR in all three soil types under three land uses. The maximum SWRP (WDPTmax), ranging from 6 to 1470 s with the median value of 56 s, differed with land use by following descending order of IP > DP > IC. The effects of land use on SWRP differed with soil type. Compared with other two soils, LIS soil had higher differences in WDPTmax between IP and DP, but lower differences in WDPTmax between DP and IC. Most of the SWRP parameters were significantly correlated with soil organic carbon (SOC) content. In soils with higher SOC content, SWR usually developed under drier conditions and declined as soils were maintained under wetter conditions. This study suggests that the WDPTmax appears at soil water contents of 0.17 to 0.19 cm(3) cm(-3) (equivalent to 0.15 to 0.16 g g(-1)). Soil water repellency persistence was positively related to SOC content. Soils with SOC content < 2% tended to be wettable, while soils with SOC content > 4% tended to be water-repellent. A Gaussian model with three physically meaningful parameters was developed to successfully fit the SWRP curve (SWRPC, LnWDPT as a function of theta). Our study also showed the possibility to predict the model parameters and SWRPC using SOC content. The model needs to be tested across other soil types, land uses, and climates before it can be widely applied to predict the SWR occurrence from SOC data. Future work should also focus on the impacts of SOC composition on SWRP parameters and other hydrological properties for predicting soil water processes in water-repellent soils.

However, such strategy can influence the starch and grain quality. Hence, the effects of SI on winter wheat starch structure and functionality were studied on ridge-furrow (RF) and flat tillage (FT) treated fields. Flat irrigation was set as control. RF + SI significantly increased the grain yield throughout the study period (2016-2018). SI decreased the amylose content and the content of amylopectin chains with DP 13-24 but increased the proportions of amylopectin chains with DP 6-12 and 25-36. The starch granule relative crystallinity decreased, and more B-type granules were produced by SI treatment. SI significantly increased the resistant starch content in both raw and cooked starch systems. Flat tillage enhanced the effect of SI on granule specific surface area (SSA) and viscosity, which increased starch paste viscosity, while SI + RF showed the opposite effects. Our study demonstrates important combined effects of SI and tillage on wheat starch quality.																			0144-8617	1879-1344				OCT 15	2021	270								118310	10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.118310	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.118310		JUN 2021						34364588					WOS:000684293000001

Lateglacial to Mid-Holocene Vegetation History in the Eastern Vale of Pickering, Northeast Yorkshire, UK: Pollen Diagrams from Palaeolake Flixton	QUATERNARY												Palaeolake Flixton, in the eastern Vale of Pickering in northeast Yorkshire, UK, existed as open water during the Lateglacial and early to mid-Holocene, until hydroseral succession and gradual terrestrialisation changed it to an area of fen and basin peatland by the later mid-Holocene. The environs of the lake were occupied by Late Palaeolithic and Mesolithic people over thousands of years and many Early Mesolithic sites, in particular, have been found located along the ancient lake edge, including the paradigm site for the British Early Mesolithic at Star Carr, where occupation occurred over several centuries. We have analysed eleven sediment cores, distributed in most parts of the palaeolake area, for pollen and stratigraphic data with which to reconstruct lake development and vegetation history. These new diagrams augment earlier pollen studies from the western part of the lake, particularly in the Star Carr area and near other major Mesolithic sites around Seamer Carr. Especially informative are a long core from the deepest part of the lake; cores that document the Lateglacial as well as early Holocene times, and evidence for the later Mesolithic that helps to balance the high density of Late Mesolithic sites known from research in the adjacent uplands of the North York Moors. There are many records of charcoal in the deposits but, especially for the earliest examples, it is not always possible to tie them firmly to either human activity or natural causes. Overall, the new and previously existing diagrams provide evidence for the spatial reconstruction of vegetation history across this important wetland system, including (a) for the progression of natural community successions within the wetland and on the surrounding dryland (b) the influence of climate change in bringing about changes in woodland composition and (c) for discussion of the possibility of human manipulation of the vegetation in the Late Upper Palaeolithic, Early and Late Mesolithic. Results show that climate was the main driver of longer-term vegetation change. Centennial-scale, abrupt climate events caused significant vegetation reversals in the Lateglacial Interstadial. The Lateglacial vegetation was very similar throughout the lake hinterland, although some areas supported some scrubby shrub rather than being completely open. Immigration and spread of Holocene woodland taxa comprised the familiar tree succession common in northern England but the timings of the establishment and the abundance of some individual tree types varied considerably around the lake margins because of edaphic factors and the effects of fire, probably of human origin. Woodland successions away from proximity to the lake were similar to those recorded in the wider landscape of northern England and produced a dense, homogenous forest cover occasionally affected by fire.																			2571-550X					DEC	2022	5	4							52	10.3390/quat5040052	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/quat5040052													WOS:000904303300001

Assessments of salinity dynamics and sustainability indicators under alternative agricultural practices are needed to identify the right combination of practices that improve sustainability while minimizing land and environmental degradation.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the potential of conservation agriculture (CA)-based practices, water-saving irrigation, water quality, and nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates for improving the sustainability of rice-wheat (RWS) and cotton-wheat (CWS) systems in salt-affected irrigated drylands. METHODS: The study included mixed-method approaches of two years of field experiments, soil profile and groundwater salinity simulation using Hydrus-1D model, and multi-criteria trade-off analysis for the holistic assessment of alternative innovations in RWS and CWS. The treatments in experiments were composed of a combination of CA-based practices, water-saving irrigation and N rates. Fourteen sustainability indicators computed from experiments and simulation were compared to evaluate the sustainability of those cropping systems and to reveal the potential of those practices for improving sustainability.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the initial conditions, the soil salinity decreased in both cropping systems, while the reduction rate was much higher in RWS than CWS (by 28%). In RWS, the conventional treatment had the lowest salinity level, while in CWS, CA (permeant bed + residue retention) had the lowest. RWS raised the groundwater table by 25% compared to CWS. The long-term scenario analysis with Hydrus-1D demonstrated that, with increased irrigation water salinity and soil evaporation rates, soil profile salinity increases by 78% in RWS and 66% in CWS. RWS had a higher net profit (+81%) and soil organic carbon (SOC) (-15%), but lower water productivity (WP) (-147%), nitrogen, and energy use efficiency (EUE) (-46%) than CWS. The CA-based practices in CWS improved sustainability indicators with higher yield and net profit (+20%), WP (+26%), SOC (+456%), and EUE (36%) with decreased soil salinity than in the conventional system.SIGNIFICANCE: The study attempts to assess the effectiveness of resource conservation technologies such as choice of crop species and cropping systems, and tillage and water and fertilizer management practices for improving sustainability. This study showed the significance of agronomic, soil, and water management practices for minimizing soil salinity. Further, the findings from this study strongly demonstrated the role of CA in sustainable agricultural production particularly under CWS in salt-affected irrigated dryland.

R. Br.) is a staple food that is widely cultivated in sub-Saharan Africa. In August 2018, a survey was conducted in the main producing regions of Burkina Faso, and leaf samples were analyzed using virion-associated nucleic acid (VANA)-based metagenomic approach and Illumina sequencing. A new virus, tentatively named "Pennisetum glaucum marafivirus" (PGMV), was detected, and its complete nucleotide sequence of 6364 nucleotides was determined. The sequence contains a large open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polyprotein of 224.2 kDa with five domains (methyltransferase, papain-like protease, helicase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and coat proteins), typical of marafiviruses. Additionally, a characteristic conserved marafibox domain was detected in the genome. The nucleotide sequence of the complete PGMV genome shares 68.5% identity with that of sorghum bicolor marafivirus, and its coat protein shares 58.5% identity with that of oat blue dwarf virus. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the pearl millet virus is unambiguously grouped with members of the genus Marafivirus in the family Tymoviridae. This is the first report on the occurrence of a marafivirus in pearl millet.

J	Noor, H; Sun, M; Lin, W; Gao, ZQ				Noor, Hafeez; Sun, Min; Lin, Wen; Gao, Zhiqiang			Effect of Different Sowing Methods on Water Use Efficiency and Grain Yield of Wheat in the Loess Plateau, China	WATER												Research has revealed that summer fallow sowing improves the water use efficiency (WUE) and grain yield of winter wheat. However, wheat yields differ yearly with crop management. A field experiment over 8 years was established in the Loess Plateau to determine the role of precipitation and soil water storage in wheat yield formation under conservation tillage. The average WUE values were 7.8, 11.0, and 12.6 t center dot ha(-1), while the average evapotranspiration (ET) values were 334.7, 365.5, and 410 mm when the yields were 3.0, 3.0-4.5, and over 4.5 t center dot ha(-1), respectively. Compared to drill sowing (DS), high water consumption during early growth increased the spike number, grain number, and yield. In years of intermediate or low yields, wide-space sowing (WS) and furrow sowing (FS) improved the ET, WUE, spike number, grain number, and yield of wheat compared to (DS) drill sowing. When the wheat yield was 3.0-4.5 t center dot ha(-1), higher soil water intake during jointing, anthesis, and anthesis-maturity increased the tiller number, 1000-grain weight, and yield, related to the use of suitable tillers. Synchronous increases in grain number per spike and 1000-grain weight were observed with increased soil water content at jointing, maturity, and anthesis, as well as consumption of soil water in the latter part during the growing season.

Understanding the response of sorghum cultivars to nitrogen applications in the semi-arid Nigeria using the agricultural production systems simulator	JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION												The Agricultural Production Systems simulator (APSIM) model was calibrated and evaluated using two improved sorghum varieties conducted in an experiment designed in a randomized complete block, 2014-2016 at two research stations in Nigeria. The results show that the model replicated the observed yield accounting for yield differences and variations in phenological development between the two sorghum cultivars. For early-maturing cultivar (ICSV-400), the model indicated by low accuracy with root means square error (RMSE) for biomass and grain yields of 20.3% and 23.7%. Meanwhile, Improved-Deko (medium-maturing) cultivar shows the model was calibrated with low RMSE (11.1% for biomass and 13.9% for grain). Also, the model captured yield response to varying Nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications in the three agroecological zones simulated. The N-fertilizer increased simulated grain yield by 26-52% for ICSV-400 and 19-50% for Improved-Deko compared to unfertilized treatment in Sudano-Sahelian zone. The insignificant yield differences between N-fertilizer rates of 60 and 100 kgha(-1) suggests 60 kgNha(-1) as the optimal rate for Sudano-Sahelian zone. Similarly, grain yield increased by 23-57% for ICSV-400 and 19-59% for Improved Deko compared to unfertilized N-treatment while the optimal mean grain yield was simulated at 80 kgNha(-1) in the Sudan savanna zone. In the northern Guinea savanna, mean simulated grain yield increased by 8-20% for ICSV-400 and 12-23% for Improved-Deko when N-fertilizer was applied compared to unfertilized treatment. Optimum grain yield was obtained at 40 kgha(-1). Our study suggests a review of blanket recommended fertilizer rates across semi-arid environments for sorghum to maximize productivity and eliminate fertilizer losses, means of adaptation strategies to climate variability.

The objective of the present study was to assess the association between vegetation openness in traditional tree-crop agroforestry systems in Senegal, richness and abundance of vertebrates including insectivorous birds and bats, and their contribution to the natural regulation of crop pests. The millet head miner (MHM), Heliocheilus albipunctella (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae), a major constraint to increasing millet crop productivity in sub-Saharan Africa, was selected as a model system. Ten sites separated by at least one km from each other were selected in a 100 km(2) study area in the Peanut basin in Senegal. In each site, a pair of millet fields distant from at least 100 m each was selected according to a gradient of vegetation openness within a 100-m radius buffer with sampling plot (5 x 5 m) at the center. Nine insectivorous bird and bat species were recorded in millet fields over the 2017 cropping season and their predator status was confirmed by direct observation or DNA detection in fecal samples. Grain losses were reduced when panicles were accessible to birds and bats, confirming their net contribution to pest regulation. At a local scale, tree diversity and vegetation openness were important predictors of the abundance of insectivorous village weaver birds and grey-headed sparrows, respectively. Some tree species (soapberry trees and neems) indirectly contributed to natural regulation of the MHM likely by providing refuges to insectivorous vertebrates whereas other tree species (baobabs) provided disservices as possible refuges for the MHM moths. Further research is needed to better understand relationships between tree cover, food web interactions and natural pest suppression, so that specific conservation measures such as habitat management can be designed to improve pest control.

It is crucial and urgent that advanced technologies are used to efficiently and accurately assess the status of salinization processes. Case studies to determine the relations between particular types of salinization and their spectral reflectances are essential because of the distinctive characteristics of the reflectance spectra of particular salts. During April 2015 we collected surface soil samples (0-10 cm depth) at 64 field sites in the downstream area of Minqin Oasis in Northwest China, an area that is undergoing serious salinization. We developed a linear model for determination of salt content in soil from hyperspectral data as follows. First, we undertook chemical analysis of the soil samples to determine their soluble salt contents. We then measured the reflectance spectra of the soil samples, which we post-processed using a continuum-removed reflectance algorithm to enhance the absorption features and better discriminate subtle differences in spectral features. We applied a normalized difference salinity index to the continuum-removed hyperspectral data to obtain all possible waveband pairs. Correlation of the indices obtained for all of the waveband pairs with the wavebands corresponding to measured soil salinities showed that two wavebands centred at wavelengths of 1358 and 2382 nm had the highest sensitivity to salinity. We then applied the linear regression modelling to the data from half of the soil samples to develop a soil salinity index for the relationships between wavebands and laboratory measured soluble salt content. We used the hyperspectral data from the remaining samples to validate the model. The salt content in soil from Minqin Oasis were well produced by the model. Our results indicate that wavelengths at 1358 and 2382 nm are the optimal wavebands for monitoring the concentrations of chlorine and sulphate compounds, the predominant salts at Minqin Oasis. Our modelling provides a reference for future case studies on the use of hyperspectral data for predictive quantitative estimation of salt content in soils in arid regions. Further research is warranted on the application of this method to remotely sensed hyperspectral data to investigate its potential use for large-scale mapping of the extent and severity of soil salinity.

To investigate the effect and the mechanism of action of ethyl pyruvate (EP) against blue mold of sweet cherry fruit caused by Penicillium oxalicum, the spores were treated with 25mgL(-1) EP. The spore germination rate of P. oxalicum, the integrities of the cell wall and plasma membrane, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were evaluated. RESULTSEP treatment significantly suppressed post-harvest blue mold of sweet cherry fruit. We found that the treatment of 25mgL(-1) EP significantly suppressed blue mold of post-harvest sweet cherry fruit by directly inhibiting germination and the mycelial growth of P. oxalicum. After co-inoculation with EP for 30min, the spore germination rate of P. oxalicum was reduced by 83.5%. In addition, the pH of the EP solution was found to affect its antimicrobial activity. After treatment with EP, the cell surface structures of the spores of P. oxalicum were much more incomplete, and higher ROS and MDA values were recorded in the spores. CONCLUSIONSThe results suggested that EP treatment destroyed the integrities of the cell surface structures and caused oxidative damage of the spores of P. oxalicum.

Lacking discernible symptoms, toxoplasmosis is difficult to detect and diagnose in infected animals. Here, to estimate the prevalence of natural infection by Toxoplasma gondii, we used PCR to amplify and detect T. gondii DNA in semen from 92 rams of three breeds from four regions in Tunisia and seroprevalence was determined using a commercial ELISA kit. From the PCR amplifications, 51.09 +/- 10.21% of the rams were tested positive for T. gondii with an overall seroprevalence of 39.13 +/- 9.97%. Risk factors including ram location and number of accomplished mating seasons significantly (p < .05) affected the sero- and molecular prevalence of T. gondii in semen but, there was a fair concordance between sero- and molecular prevalence (Kappa = 0.33). Sequences of T. gondii from five positive samples were 100% identical (same haplotype). Comparison of these sequences with those archived at the GenBank showed a sequence similarity range between 95 and 100%. The haplotype defining the five Tunisian sequences was similar to the one observed in chicken, cats, European pole cat and humans from Brazil, St Kitts and Nevis, Great Britain and Tunisia, respectively. This indicates its wide geographic distribution and non-species specificity. Our findings suggest a high prevalence of toxoplasmosis in Tunisian matting rams; further studies concerning its venereal transmission capacity are needed prior to recommending a systematic screening of T. gondii DNA in rams' semen used for both natural breeding and artificial insemination.

J	Sun, YZ; Shi, J; Wang, X; Ding, CF; Wang, J				Sun, Yuanze; Shi, Jia; Wang, Xiang; Ding, Changfeng; Wang, Jie			Deciphering the Mechanisms Shaping the Plastisphere Microbiota in Soil	MSYSTEMS												The gradual accumulation of microplastics has aroused increasing concern for the unique niche, termed "plastisphere." As research so far has focused on their characteristics in aquatic ecosystems, our understanding of the colonization and assembly of the attached bacterial communities on microplastics in soil ecosystems remains poor. Here, we aimed to characterize the plastisphere microbiomes of two types of microplastics (polylactic acid [PLA] and polyethylene [PE]) differing in their biodegradability in two different soils. After incubation for 60 days, considerably lower alpha diversity of bacterial community was observed on the microplastic surfaces, and prominent divergences occurred in the microbial community compositions between the plastisphere and the bulk soil. The temperature, rather than polymer type, significantly induced the differences between the plastisphere communities. The rRNA gene operon (rrn) copy numbers were significantly higher in the PLA plastisphere, suggesting potential degradation. The co-occurrence network analysis showed that the PE plastisphere exhibited greater network complexity and stronger stability than those in the PLA plastisphere. The stochasticity ratio indicated the remarkable importance of stochastic process on community assembly in PE and PLA plastispheres, while the null model analysis showed the nonnegligible roles of deterministic processes in shaping the plastisphere communities. Higher contributions of homogenous selection in the PLA plastisphere were observed in comparison with the PE plastisphere, which could probably be attributed to the selective pressure induced by microplastic degradation. Our findings enhance our mechanistic understanding of the diversity patterns and assembly processes of plastisphere in soil environments and have important implications for microbial ecology and microplastic risk assessment. IMPORTANCE The increasing pervasive microplastic pollution is creating a new environmental compartment, termed plastisphere. Even though there was conclusive information characterizing the plastisphere, the underlying mechanisms shaping the bacterial communities in the plastisphere in the soil remain unclear. Therefore, we incubated two types of microplastics (PE and PLA) in two different soils and explored the differences between plastisphere and bulk soil communities. Additionally, the co-occurrence network and the assembly processes of plastisphere were subjected to further analysis. Our results highlight the importance of selective recruitment of microplastics and contribute to the understanding of the diversity patterns and assembly processes of plastisphere in soil environments. The increasing pervasive microplastic pollution is creating a new environmental compartment, termed plastisphere. Even though there was conclusive information characterizing the plastisphere, the underlying mechanisms shaping the bacterial communities in the plastisphere in the soil remain unclear.

To reveal the distributions of soil aggregate stability and its influential factors following land use change from apple orchards abandonment and development in the Nangou watershed of the Loess Plateau, China, this study selected five ages of apple orchards and their planting years were 1 year, 3 years, 6 years, 8 years and 10 years, one 15-year grassland developed from an apple orchard, one 15-year grassland developed from farmland, one natural grassland and one 15-year locust. Results showed that restored vegetation had better soil aggregate stability, soil organic carbon (SOC), and nitrogen (N) than apple orchards, and the composition of soil particles with the best aggregate stability was clay 6%, silt 8%, and sand 86%. At a 0-10 cm soil depth, soil aggregate stability had a significant positive correlation with SOC and soil total nitrogen (STN), and a negative correlation with NO3- and NH4+. In addition, vegetation diversity and coverage only affected the soil aggregate stability of the 0-10 cm soil depth; however, soil pH, bulk density, and soil aggregate-associated inorganic nitrogen were the main influential factors that drove the soil aggregate stability of the 0-30 cm soil depth. Further research discovered that macro-aggregate associated NO3- and micro-aggregate associated NH4+ may be the key factors affecting the soil aggregate stability. Therefore, it is essential to further explore the effect of soil aggregate-associated inorganic nitrogen on soil aggregate stability.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014	ZHU, GUANGYU/0000-0002-8641-2422													0341-8162	1872-6887				MAY	2021	200								105181	10.1016/j.catena.2021.105181	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.105181													WOS:000620777400042

Therefore, we analyzed the distribution of soil total N (STN), particulate organic N (PON), microbial biomass N (MBN), dissolved organic N (DON), and mineral N (NO3- and NH4+) levels down to 100 cm profile under wheat-maize rotation system in northern China. The experiment was established with four 270 kg ha(-1) N equivalent fertilizer treatments: Organic manure (OM); Organic manure with nitrogen fertilizer (OM + NF); Nitrogen fertilizer (NF); and Control (CK). Results found that the OM and OM + NF treatments had significantly higher STN, PON, MBN, DON, and NO3- contents in 0-20 cm topsoil depths. Conversely, the NF treatment resulted in the highest (p < 0.01) DON and NO3- depositions in 40-100 cm subsoil depths. The NH4+ contents in selected profile depths were significantly highest (p < 0.01) under OM treatment. The correlations between STN and its fractions were positively significant at 0-10 and 10-20 cm topsoil depths. Our results suggest that partial substitution of chemical fertilizer with organic manure could be a sustainable option for soil N management of intensive farming systems.						tester22, sciencv/0000-0002-2791-7842; Hossain, Dr. Md Elias/0000-0002-3834-6838														1660-4601				DEC	2021	18	23							12848	10.3390/ijerph182312848	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182312848								34886574					WOS:000735350400001

It is also an important objective for agronomic breeding and a critical indicator to represent the status of crop growth and nitrogen absorption in the vegetative stage. Wheat is the main crop in arid regions. However, there is insufficient understanding of wheat plant height response to soil water stress. In this study, we tried to explore a new algorithm for simulating dynamics of winter wheat height under different scenarios of soil water stress based on soil column and field experiments conducted under rainout shelters between 2012 and 2016 at Yangling, Shaanxi province, China. First, we established a temperature response function of wheat plant height based on four cardinal temperatures (i.e. base temperature, lower optimal temperature, higher optimal temperature, and ceiling temperature). And we also constructed a water stress response function of wheat plant height using relative soil water availability (A(w)) as water stress index. Then, these two functions were used as multipliers to modify the first-order derivative of six distinct growth functions (i.e. Gompertz, Logistic, Mischerlich, Richards, Von Bertalanffy, and Weibull) to represent the elongation rate of wheat plant height under soil water stresses. Consequently, six modified simulation models for wheat plant height were established and identified as Mod-Geo, Mod-Log, Mod-Mis, Mod-Ric, Mod-Von, and Mod-Wei, respectively, among which an optimal simulation model was selected for winter wheat growth under soil water stresses. Based on experimental data of 2014-2015 used for model calibration, it was found that when A(w) was greater than 0.65, elongation rate of wheat height was not influenced by soil water content; when A(w) was between 0.3 and 0.65, elongation rate of wheat height gradually reduced following an exponential function driven by water stress; when Aw was less than 0.30, elongation rate of wheat height rapidly and linearly reduced driven by water stress until A(w) was close to 0 at which the elongation stopped. After that, the data of soil column experiment of 2014-2015 growing season were used to assess the parameters of the six newly established models. The results of model calibration showed that the mean value of the Willmott Index of Agreement (WIA) between measured and simulated wheat heights of the six cultivars were all less than 0.90 for all treatments in the experiment, except for the Mod-Log model (0.95). The data of soil column experiment in 2015-2016 seasons were used to validate the six calibrated new models. The results of model validation with mean value of WIA 0.93 which were even better than model calibration. Finally, the data of two growing seasons (2012-2013 and 2013-2014) of field experiments conducted under a giant rainout shelter were used for further verification of the six new models under field conditions. Among the six different plant height simulation model, Mod-Log model obtained the best values of RMSE and WIA.

In this study, a field experiment of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was conducted in two consecutive growing seasons (2012-2014) under rainfall shelter in arid areas of China, with the purpose to identify to what extent the soil parameters could influence the simulated output variables in the DSSAT-CERES-Wheat model under water stress conditions. The permanent wilting point (PWP), which were initially indirectly measured based on soil sampling, were manually tuned through a trial-and-error method based on field observations of soil water content and aboveground biomass. The results showed that the maximum advancing of maturity date was about five days under water stress conditions. The stages of returning green and grain-filling were critical periods for agricultural water management of winter wheat in arid areas. The relative mean absolute error (RMAE) of simulated and observed variables were almost all less than 20% when water stress occurred at the heading and grain-filling stages. However, there were relatively large simulation errors when water stress occurred at the wintering and returning green stages. In addition, the CERES-Wheat model did not correctly simulate the discrepancies in phenology dates of winter wheat. The overall averaged root mean square error of all treatments for total water storage in 0-100 cm soil layer and winter wheat biomass decreased to 0.3 mm and 750 kg ha(-1) after manually tuning the initially indirectly measured value of PWP. In general, the CERES-Wheat model showed some limitations to simulate winter growth under complicated arid conditions. Meanwhile, the measurement uncertainty in soil parameter PWP could introduce large simulation errors in simulating crop growth response to severe water stress conditions. We suggest the soil parameter PWP should be more carefully calibrated based on relevant field observations since it is related to crop type and difficult to be directly and precisely measured. In general, it is necessary to further research into the responding mechanism and simulation of winter wheat growth to water stress in liable-drought areas.

Discovery and validation of candidate genes for grain iron and zinc metabolism in pearl millet [<i>Pennisetum glaucum</i> (L.) R. Br.]	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Pearl millet is an important crop for alleviating micronutrient malnutrition through genomics-assisted breeding for grain Fe (GFeC) and Zn (GZnC) content. In this study, we identified candidate genes related to iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) metabolism through gene expression analysis and correlated it with known QTL regions for GFeC/GZnC. From a total of 114 Fe and Zn metabolism-related genes that were selected from the related crop species, we studied 29 genes. Different developmental stages exhibited tissue and stage-specific expressions for Fe and Zn metabolism genes in parents contrasting for GFeC and GZnC. Results revealed that PglZIP, PglNRAMP and PglFER gene families were candidates for GFeC and GZnC. Ferritin-like gene, PglFER1 may be the potential candidate gene for GFeC. Promoter analysis revealed Fe and Zn deficiency, hormone, metal-responsive, and salt-regulated elements. Genomic regions underlying GFeC and GZnC were validated by annotating major QTL regions for grain Fe and Zn. Interestingly, PglZIP and PglNRAMP gene families were found common with a previously reported linkage group 7 major QTL region for GFeC and GZnC. The study provides insights into the foundation for functional dissection of different Fe and Zn metabolism genes homologs and their subsequent use in pearl millet molecular breeding programs globally.

In the China, schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma japonicum is mainly endemic to the Yangtze River valley. The amphibious snail Oncomelania hupensis (O. hupensis) is the unique intermediate host of S. japonicum; hence, snail control is a crucial approach in the process of schistosomiasis transmission control and elimination. In 2016, a nationwide snail survey was conducted involving all snail habitats recorded since 1950 in all endemic counties of 12 provinces. A total of 53,254 existing snail habitats (ESHs) were identified, presenting three clusters in Sichuan Basin, Dongting Lake, and Poyang Lake. The overall habitat area was 5.24 billion m(2), of which 3.58 billion m(2) were inhabited by O. hupensis. The area inhabited by snails (AIS) in Dongting and Poyang Lakes accounted for 76.53% of the population in the country. Three typical landscape types (marshland and lakes, mountains and hills, and plain water networks) existed in endemic areas, and marshland and lakes had a predominant share (3.38 billion m(2)) of the AIS. Among the 12 endemic provinces, Hunan had a share of nearly 50% of AIS, whereas Guangdong had no ESH. Ditches, dryland, paddy fields, marshland, and ponds are common habitat types of the ESH. Although the AIS of the marshland type accounted for 87.22% of the population in the whole country, ditches were the most common type (35,025 or 65.77%) of habitat. Six categories of vegetation for ESHs were identified. A total of 39,139 habitats were covered with weeds, accounting for 55.26% of the coverage of the area. Multiple vegetation types of snail habitats appeared in the 11 provinces, but one or two of these were mainly dominant. Systematic sampling showed that the presence of living snails was 17.88% among the 13.5 million sampling frames. The occurrence varied significantly by landscape, environment, and vegetation type. The median density of living snails in habitats was 0.50 per frame (0.33 m x 0.33 m), and the highest density was 40.01 per frame. Furthermore, two main clusters with high snail densities and spatial correlations indicated by hotspot analysis were identified: one in Hunan and Hubei, the other in Sichuan. This national survey is the first full-scale census on the distribution of O. hupensis, which is significant, as transmission interruption and elimination are truly becoming the immediate goal of schistosomiasis control in China. The study discerns the detailed geographic distribution of O. hupensis with the hotspots of snail density in China. It is beneficial to understand the status of the snail population in order to finally formulate further national control planning.						lv, chao/0000-0002-4087-4672; Zhou, Xiao-Nong/0000-0003-1417-8427														2414-6366				FEB	2023	8	2							120	10.3390/tropicalmed8020120	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/tropicalmed8020120								36828536					WOS:000942035500001
J	Xue, PL; Pei, JB; Ma, N; Wang, JK				Xue, Pingluo; Pei, Jiubo; Ma, Nan; Wang, Jingkuan			Microbial Residual Nitrogen Distribution in Brown Earth's Aggregates as Affected by Different Maize Residues and Soil Fertility Levels	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Brown earth is one of the typical soils in the dryland areas of Northeast China, and its degradation is closely related to food security in the local. Effectively preventing soil nitrogen (N) loss can promote the soil fertility supply. As the hub of nitrogen cycling, microorganisms play an important role in N transformation and accumulation. Soil aggregates are important in improving soil fertility and preventing soil degradation because they are an important index to maintain soil fertility. However, the allocation of microbial residual N and its contribution to total N in brown earth's aggregates are still limited, especially the effects of different maize residue types' return and soil fertility levels. Focusing on this, a 360-day laboratory incubation experiment at 25 degrees C was carried out induced by adding maize roots and shoots into brown earth with low (L) and high (H) fertility, respectively. Randomized soil samples were taken on the incubation day of 0, 30, 60, 180, and 360, and then, they were divided into macroaggregates (>250 mu m) and microaggregates (<250 mu m) using a dry-sieved method. The relative contributions of fungal and bacterial residual N to soil total N were calculated by the amino sugar content to examine the accumulated differences of microbial residual N in brown earth's aggregates with the addition of different parts of maize residues and fertility levels. The results showed that maize residue types had different effects on the fungal and bacterial residual N enrichment in soil aggregates. In macroaggregates, maize roots promoted the accumulation of fungal residual N. The fungal residual N contributions to total nitrogen with root treatments were 1.03 times more than those with shoot treatments. However, in microaggregates, the bacterial residual N contributions to total nitrogen with shoot treatments were 1.01 times more than those with root treatments. These indicated that maize roots should be more beneficial to the accumulation of bacterial residual N in microaggregates. Moreover, the high fertility soil could sequester more microbial residual N than the low fertility soil, showing the content of microbial residual N in high fertility was 1.12-1.18 times more than that in low fertility. Furthermore, the fungal residual N was more beneficially accumulated in low fertility soil. Regardless of the level of fertility, the proportion of N in total N with shoot treatment was higher than that with root treatment, indicating that the above ground maize residues could better promote the metabolic process of microorganisms than the below ground ones. These could provide a theoretical basis for studying the microbial transformation mechanism of nitrogen after maize straw returning to the field, which could be of great significance to main soil fertility.																				2296-665X				APR 14	2022	10								892039	10.3389/fenvs.2022.892039	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.892039													WOS:000796935800001

Therefore, identification of the key genes associated with endosperm development and endoreduplication would not only lay the groundwork for understanding the biological process of endoreduplication but also be important for maize breeding. Here, we identified 12 putative endoreduplication-related candidate genes as members of the Zea mays L. SIAMESE-RELATED (ZmSMR) gene family and denoted them ZmSMR1-ZmSMR12. Sequence analysis indicated that all the ZmSMR protein sequences exhibited modest sequence similarity to the SIAMESE gene from Arabidopsis. Further analyses suggested that most ZmSMR genes might be associated with the transition from mitosis to endoreduplication because the expression levels of most ZmSMR genes were upregulated in endosperm cells during the phase of switching to an endoreduplication cell cycle. Additionally, the ZmSMRs responded to various abiotic stresses at the transcriptional level. One member of the ZmSMR gene family, the ZmSMR4 (KY946768) gene, was isolated as the first maize endoreduplication-related gene and has been used to develop transgenic Arabidopsis plants. ZmSMR4 was localized to the nucleus and could interact with ZmCDKA and ZmCDKB. Moreover, ZmSMR4 was able to rescue the multicellular trichome phenotype of Arabidopsis sim mutants and enhanced the endoreduplication levels of transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Arabidopsis plants overexpressing ZmSMR4 not only displayed enhanced leaf margin serrations but also showed several interesting breeding phenotypes, such as early blossoming and fuller seeds. Taken together, our data suggest that the ZmSMR4 gene is plant-specific and functions as a key player in the signalling network that controls plant growth, development and responses to abiotic stress by regulating the transition between the mitotic cycle and endoreduplication.

J	Liu, ZB; Wang, YH; Yu, PT; Xu, LH; Yu, SP				Liu, Zebin; Wang, Yanhui; Yu, Pengtao; Xu, Lihong; Yu, Songping			Environmental and canopy conditions regulate the forest floor evapotranspiration of larch plantations	FOREST ECOSYSTEMS												Background: Integrated forest-water management focusing on forest-water coordination is an important way to alleviate water use conflicts among forests and other sectors in vast dryland regions. Forest floor evapotranspiration (FE), which is an important component of forest evapotranspiration, accounts for a large proportion of the water consumed in arid forests. Elucidating how environmental and canopy conditions impact FE has important significance for guiding integrated forest-water management in a changing environment. Methods: The microlysimeter (ML)-measured evapotranspiration (FEML), reference evapotranspiration (ETo), volumetric soil moisture (VSM), and canopy leaf area index (LAI) were monitored in a Larix principis-rupprechtii plantation located in the semi-humid Liupan Mountains of Northwest China in 2019 (June-September) and 2021 (May-September). The response functions of the FE coefficient (the ratio of daily FEML to ETo) to the individual factors of VSM and LAI were determined using upper boundary lines of scatter diagrams of measured data. The framework of the daily FE (FEML) model was established by multiplying the response functions to individual factors and then calibrated and validated using measured data to assess the FE response to environmental and canopy conditions. Results: (1) The FE coefficient increased first rapidly and then slowly with rising VSM but decreased slowly with rising LAI. (2) The simple daily FE (FEML) model developed by coupling the impacts of ETo, LAI, and VSM in this study performed well for predicting FE. (3) The impacts of ETo, LAI, and VSM were quantified using the FE (FEML) model, e.g., at a given VSM, the impact of ETo on FE increased obviously with decreasing LAI; at a given ETo, the impact of LAI on FE increased with rising VSM. (4) In the two study years, when directly using the microlysimeter measurement, the real FE on the forest floor was overestimated when the VSM in microlysimeters was above 0.215 but underestimated below 0.215 due to the difference in VSM from the forest floor. Thus, the VSM on the forest floor should be input into the FE model for estimating the real FE on the forest floor. Conclusions: The daily FE of larch plantation is controlled by three main factors of environmental (ETo and VSM) and canopy conditions (LAI). The variation in daily FE on the forest floor can be well estimated using the simple FE model coupling the effects of the three main factors and by inputting the VSM on the forest floor into the model to avoid the errors when directly using the microlysimeter measurement with different VSMs from the forest floor. The developed FE model and suggested prediction approach are helpful to estimate the FE response to changing conditions, and to guide forest management practices when saving water by thinning is required.					xu, li/GNH-3667-2022; wang, yanhui/HPG-3348-2023														2095-6355	2197-5620					2022	9								100058	10.1016/j.fecs.2022.100058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fecs.2022.100058		JUL 2022											WOS:000844618300001
J	Ibrahim, S; Kaduk, J; Tansey, K; Balzter, H; Lawal, UM				Ibrahim, Sa'Ad; Kaduk, Jorg; Tansey, Kevin; Balzter, Heiko; Lawal, Umar Mohammed			Detecting phenological changes in plant functional types over West African savannah dominated landscape	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Phenology is an important component in the climate system, and play a key role in controlling many feedbacks of vegetation to the climate systems. Differences in phenology of plant functional types (PFTs) due to the variation in seasonal cycles (e.g. changes in weather variability), the impact from land-use activities (e.g. fire) and their mechanisms for adaptation (e.g. climate change, regrowth/post-fire regeneration) have major implications in conservation planning and monitoring actions. Detecting phenological variations in PFTs is therefore of great importance to quantitative remote sensing applications, especially in a biome as diverse and complex as savannah. In this study, we implement Savitzky-Golay filtering and the Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) algorithms to detect changes in PFTs based on their phenological events using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from 2001 to 2018. In this region, PFTs present distinct seasonal, annual and interannual variability. Woody phenology presents early green-up dates with a prolonged senescence period and invariably observed the longest growing season length (GSL). The relationship between the start of season (SOS) or end of season (EOS) was assessed for each PFT to find out the extent to which they determine GSL for different PFTs. GSL is mostly determined by the SOS in woody savannah (coefficient of determination (R-2) =0.41, p <0.01), open shrubs and (R-2 =0.79, p <0.001), grassland (R-2 =0.35, p <0.01) while EOS determined the GSL for both dryland crops (R-2 =0.75, p <0.001) and paddy rice (R-2 =0.69, p <0.001). We compared the interannual variability of woody savannah and other PFTs by measuring the differences of their phenological indicators using Welch's t-test. All PFTs show statistically significant difference with the GSL of woody savannah except open shrubs (p = 0.23). The abrupt vegetation changes estimated with BFAST varied by PFT. Some PFTs are more resilient to harsh environmental conditions than others. While woody species present a few abrupt changes, grass phenology is more vulnerable to disturbance, seasonally as well as in the trend components (large number of abrupt changes) with browning trend following an abrupt negative change. In all PFTs, breakpoint (disturbance) assessed using BFAST negatively correlate with precipitation data which means the magnitude of disturbance decreases with increasing precipitation. Woody species had an r (correlation coefficient) value of -0.5 while grassland had r = -0.7 which is a further indication that grass phenology responds more strongly to annual precipitation than the woody species. These results show that MODIS NDVI time-series data can be used to distinguish the phenological events of different PFTs in West African savannah dominated landscape.

Yet, in temperate agricultural crop soils, little is understood about the functional significance of indigenous photosynthetic microbial communities for various soil processes. This study investigated how indigenous soil algae and cyanobacteria affected topsoil aggregate stability in cereal cropping systems. Topsoil aggregates from conventional and organic cropping systems were incubated in microcosms under dark or photoperiodic conditions with or without a treatment with an herbicide (isoproturon). Physicochemical parameters (bound exopolysaccharides, organic carbon) and microbial parameters (esterase activity, chlorophyll a biomass, and pigment profiles) were measured for incubated aggregates. Aggregate stability were analyzed on the basis of aggregate size distribution and the mean weight diameter (MWD) index, resulting from disaggregation tests. Soil photosynthetic microbial biomass (chl a) was strongly and positively correlated with aggregate stability indicators. The development of microalgae crusts in photoperiodic conditions induced a strong increase of the largest aggregates (>2 mm), as compared to dark conditions (up to 10.6 fold and 27.1 fold, in soil from organic and conventional cropping systems, respectively). Concomitantly, the MWD significantly increased by 2.4 fold and 4.2 fold, for soil from organic and conventional cropping systems. Soil microalgae may have operated directly via biochemical mechanisms, by producing exopolymeric matrices surrounding soil aggregates (bound exopolysaccharides: 0.39-0.45 mu g C g(-1) soil), and via biophysical mechanisms, where filamentous living microbiota enmeshed soil aggregates. In addition, they may have acted indirectly by stimulating heterotrophic microbial communities, as revealed by the positive effect of microalgal growth on total microbial activity. The herbicide treatment negatively impacted soil microalgal community, resulting in significant decreases of the MWD of the conventional soil aggregates (up to -42% of the value in light treatment). This study underscores that indigenous edaphic algae and cyanobacteria can promote aggregate formation, by forming photosynthetic microbiotic crusts, thus improving the structural stability of topsoil, in temperate croplands. However, the herbicide uses can impair the functional abilities of algal and cyanobacterial communities in agricultural soils. Originality/Significance: Edaphic algal and cyanobacterial communities are known to form photosynthetic microbial crusts in arid soils, where they drive key ecosystem functions. Although less well characterized, such communities are also transiently abundant in temperate and mesic cropped soils. This microcosm study investigated the communities' functional significance in topsoil aggregate formation and stabilization in two temperate cropping systems. Overall, our results showed that the development of indigenous microalgal communities under our experimental conditions drove higher structural stability in topsoil aggregates in temperate cropland soils. Also, herbicide use affected photosynthetic microbial communities and consequently impaired soil aggregation.

Deep tillage can effectively loosen the soil and reduce the compaction of deep soil, while no-tillage can ensure the sustainable use of soil. In this study, we selected three paddy upland multiple cropping rotation areas in Southern China. Two tillage regimes were carried out, one (DT) where rice straw mulching was followed by deep tillage (subsoiling 30 cm) and then, for the next three years, no-tillage in the flue-cured tobacco planting season and rotary tillage in the rice planting season vs a control (RT) where no tillage after rice straw mulching was carried out, and rotary tillage was conducted in both the flue-cured tobacco planting season and rice planting season for the next three years. We compared the yield and output value of flue-cured tobacco and grain yield under DT and RT tillage regimes in the three areas, and analyzed the economic benefits brought by DT. Furthermore, we identified the effects of DT on soil aggregates, soil organic carbon (SOC), crop growth, and nutrient uptake at the experimental site in Yunyuan. Compared with RT, DT can increase the weight proportion of macroaggregates and SOC content in the 10-30 cm soil layer and improve the stability of soil aggregates in the 0-30 cm soil layer. In 2019, the mean weight diameter (MWD) and geometric mean diameter (GMD) of the 0-30 cm soil layer increased by 0.47 mm and 0.20 mm, respectively, on average. In 2020, the MWD and GMD increased by 0.33 mm and 0.11 mm, respectively, on average. DT promoted the roots of flue-cured tobacco to extend down to the 30-40 cm soil layer, and DT flue-cured tobacco plants had more leaves, higher dry matter weight, and greater N and P absorption than RT flue-cured tobacco. These results were conducive to the increase of yield and output value of flue-cured tobacco. During the threeyear test period, the yield of flue-cured tobacco increased by 4%-9%, the output value increased by 7% -13%, and the net economic benefits also increased. In the paddy-upland multiple cropping rotation areas of Southern China, DT is more conducive to the improvement of dryland crop yield than paddy field crop yield. Intermittent deep tillage (one-time deep tillage and then no tillage) is expected to provide a potential way to effectively increase production, high economic efficiency, and soil improvement in promoting sustainable agricultural development and cleaner production.

Phytoremediation and high rainfall combine to improve soil and plant health in a North America Northern Great Plains saline sodic soil	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Saline/sodic soils are often remediated by applying gypsum, improving drainage, and irrigating with high quality water. However, these management approaches may not be effective or feasible in dryland soils supersaturated with gypsum. A field study, conducted between 2017 and 2021, investigated the effect of phytoremediation on soil and plant health in a landscape containing productive, transition, and saline/sodic soils. Phytoremediation treatments-corn (Zea mays) and two perennial grass mixes (mix 1 slender wheatgrass [Elymus trachycaulus] and beardless wildrye [Leymus triticoides], and mix 2 slender wheatgrass, creeping meadow foxtail [Alopecurus arundinaceus], western wheatgrass [Agropyron smithii], and green wheatgrass [Elymus Hoffmannii])-were planted and compared with a no-plant control treatment across three soil zones. Perennial grasses were dormant seeded in the winter of 2017 and 2018, and corn was grown in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Soil samples (0 to 15 cm) were collected on July 24, 2018, July 23, 2019, July 24, 2020, and April 15, 2021. Across soil zones, corn production was 5,990 (grain + stover), 3,900 (stover only), and 6,150 (grain + stover) kg ha(-1) in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, whereas perennial grass biomass yields averaged 1,220, 9,065, and 7,375 kg ha(-1) in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. Due to high rainfall that occurred from the fall of 2018 through the summer of 2019, the depth to the water table decreased and the soil electrical conductivity (EC1:1) (-0.83 +/- 0.149 dS m(-1)) and exchangeable sodium (Na+) (-656 +/- 220) decreased in all treatments. In addition, from 2018 to 2019, the risk of soil dispersion (lower Na+/EC1:1 ratio) was less in treatments with growing plants (p = 0.02) than plots without plants. With drier conditions from the fall of 2019 through the spring of 2021, the depth to groundwater increased, the EC1:1 decreased in the transition soil but increased in the saline/sodic soil (p = 0.001), and the Na+/EC1:1 ratio increased in the productive and transition soils and was static or decreased in the saline/sodic soil (p = 0.001). In conclusion, this and related work showed that phytoremediation when combined with high natural rainfall reduced soil EC1:1 and the exchangeable Na+ in all soils; however, these benefits may be short lived, and as the water tables dropped in 2020, EC1:1 increased in the saline/sodic zones. Laboratory and linked research from the study site also showed that fertilizing saline sodic soils can result in very high nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and reseeding degraded soil to perennial plants provides soil cover that reduces the risk of erosion and provides habitat for wildlife.

Nutrient cycling and microbial responses to termite and earthworm activity in soils amended with woody residues in the Sudano-Sahel	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY												Termites and earthworms are the main groups of invertebrates in dry tropical ecosystems and exert significant effects on bioturbation and soil reorganization. The dynamics of microbial communities, enzymes and substrates associated with the flux of energy and nutrients induced by their diverse biogenic structures are still under-investigated in agroecological-based cropping systems. The objective of this study was to determine whether the biogenic structures produced by a grass-woody forager termite (Nasutitermes torquatus) and an endogeic earthworm (Millsonia inermis) shift soil organic C (OC), nutrients, enzyme activities and microbial communities in soils amended with woody residues. The experiment was a randomized block design conducted in a Sudano-Sahelian cropping system that was amended annually with woody residues (3 Mg ha(-1)) or not amended (control soils) for six consecutive years. Samples were taken from fresh sheetings and casts (produced respectively by N. torquatus and M. inermis) and bulk soils in amended plots as well as from control soils in nonamended plots. Samples were analyzed for soil texture, OC, total nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), pH, enzyme activity and microbial composition. The results showed that sheetings and casts altered soil biochemical properties significantly. Sheetings and casts were remarkably enriched in OC (45-55% and 82-94%, respectively) and P (20-55% and 73-130%) compared to bulk soils and control soils. Sheetings and casts substantially stimulated beta-glucosi-dase (153-178% and 158-183%, respectively) and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (43-53% and 84-93%) activity, likely due to gut mucus excretions and favorable physicochemical conditions. Sheetings and casts did not fundamentally alter the microbial diversity but raised soil conditions favorable to selective microbial growth. Overall, casts exhibited higher nutrient content (N, P), enzyme activity, and larger total microbial biomass than sheetings. Both structures stimulated soil microbial communities and enzyme activity associated with the in-crease of pH, OC and nutrients. Earthworm casts and termite sheetings have ecological significance in OC dynamics in plant residues amended soils.

J	Sun, M; Gao, XR; Zhang, YL; Song, XL; Zhao, XI				Sun, Miao; Gao, Xuerui; Zhang, Yulin; Song, Xiaolin; Zhao, Xining			A new solution of high-efficiency rainwater irrigation mode for water management in apple plantation: Design and application	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Due to the lack of stable irrigation water sources and low rainwater utilization efficiency, soil water deficit has become the main factor restricting the sustainable development of the apple industry in the Loess Plateau. The scientific and efficient use of rainwater for irrigation may provide a new solution to alleviate the regional soil water deficit. Rainwater is the only water source for the growth of apple trees, and whether it can be used as a stable and sustainable irrigation water source should be quantitatively considered. At present, there is still a lack of quantitative data to support whether rainwater can meet the irrigation needs of apple orchards. In this research, rainwater harvesting technology is combined with a solar intelligent irrigation system equipped with soil moisture sensors to form a high-efficiency rainwater irrigation (HRI) mode suitable for dryland apple orchards. Through practical application, this study found that HRI mode can effectively improve the soil drought of 0-200 cm and keep the soil water content in a relatively stable range during the apple growth period. Compared with only using rainwater harvesting technology and combined with traditional irrigation methods (SDI), HRI mode can increase apple yield by 56.2% and 22.0%, WUE by 40.4% and 12.6%, respectively. With the increase of apple yield, HRI mode has good economic feasibility, and its economic recovery period is 2 years. On the regional scale, this study selected irrigation guarantee rate and solar energy resources as evaluation indicators to further divide the areas suitable for rainwater irrigation in apple-cultivating region on the Loess Plateau. The area where the irrigation guarantee rate of rainwater was greater than 75% is 1.22 x 10(7) m(2), accounting for 47.6% of the total area. This means that apple production in the Loess Plateau can increase by approximately 549.8 tons/year, save 1.5 x 10(4) m(3) of irrigation water resources, and increase WUE by about 33.4%. Under the two different future climate scenarios (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5), the area accounted for 49.7% and 57.2% respectively, which was higher than the current situation. The areas with high rainwater irrigation guarantee rates are mostly concentrated in the central and southern parts of the apple-cultivating region. To maintain the sustainable development of the orchard ecological environment, areas with insufficient rainwater should assist other water management measures. In conclusion, high-efficiency rainwater irrigation can effectively alleviate the water contradiction in apple-cultivating region. In future agricultural water management, more attention should be paid to precision rainwater irrigation to ensure the coordinated development of agricultural economy and ecological environment.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				JAN 1	2022	259								107243	10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107243	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107243		OCT 2021											WOS:000711629200002

Precipitation during the fallow season (fallow precipitation) influences tillering in winter wheat on the semi-arid Chinese Loess Plateau. However, little work has been done regarding tiller number changes under various types of fertilization and amounts of fallow precipitation on a long-term scale. Effects of fallow precipitation and fertilization on tiller were investigated in a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) system in a 28-year field study (1990 to 2017) in a semiarid agro-ecosystem. Tiller number, spike number and grain yield were measured in four fertilization conditions: control without fertilizer (CK); mineral nitrogen fertilizer alone (N); mineral phosphorus fertilizer alone (P); mineral nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer together (NP). Based on the long-term annual fallow precipitation, dry years (mean annual fallow precipitation) were distinguished. Phosphorus fertilization alone significantly increased the mean annual tiller number (23%), and the increase in tiller number was higher in wet years (29%) than in the dry years (17%). However, nitrogen fertilization alone had little effect on mean tiller number, while nitrogen and phosphorus together significantly increased mean annual tiller number (30%), mean tiller number in wet years (45%) and mean tiller number in dry years (17%). Tiller number was significantly and positively correlated with fallow precipitation in dry years for all fertilizer treatments, whereas it was weakly and either positively or negatively correlated with fallow precipitation in wet years depending on the treatment. This study found positive correlations between tiller number and fallow precipitation in the CK and NP treatments, and it found negative correlations between tiller number and fallow precipitation in the treatments with nitrogen fertilization alone or phosphorous fertilization alone in wet years. Understanding the impacts of fallow precipitation and fertilization on tiller development shed light on ways to improve crop production in rain-fed agricultural regions.																			2095-3119					NOV	2021	20	11					3003	3011		10.1016/S2095-3119(20)63296-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(20)63296-8		SEP 2021											WOS:000709009200013

Significant progress has been made in extracting LSP information over large areas using satellite data, yet LSP retrievals remain a challenge over vast arid and semi-arid ecosystems because of sparse greenness, high variability and the lack of distinct annual patterns; for example, the MODerate Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Land Cover Dynamics Product MCD12Q2 that provides LSP metrics globally often failed to provide LSP information in these ecosystems. In this study, we used a modified threshold algorithm to extract LSP timing metrics, including the start, peak, and end of growing seasons, using the 16-day composite Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series from MODIS data. We applied this regionally customized algorithm across all arid and semi-arid climate regions of Australia (75% of the continental land area) encompassing shrublands, grasslands, savannas, woodlands, and croplands, extracting LSP metrics annually from 2003 to 2018, with up to two (phenology) seasons accounted for in each year. Our algorithm yielded an average of 64.9% successful rate of retrieval (proportion of pixels with retrieved LSP metrics) across 16 years in Arid and Semi-arid AUStralia (ASAUS), which was a significant increase compared to the 14.5% rate of retrieval yielded in our study area by the global product and the major cause of the different performances between these two approaches was the different EVI amplitude restrictions utilized to avoid spurious peaks (i.e. EVI amplitude > 0.1 used by the global product and peak EVI > time series average EVI used by our algorithm). Gross primary productivity (GPP) measurements at OzFlux eddy covariance (EC) tower sites were used to cross-compare with the presence/absence of growing seasons detected by our algorithm, and 97% of our retrieved seasons matched with those extracted using EC data. Preliminary tests at five OzFlux sites showed that our algorithm was robust to view angle-induced sensitivity of the input data and showed similar performance when using EVI data calculated using MODIS Nadir BRDFAdjusted Reflectance product. Our retrieved LSP metrics revealed that vegetation growth in arid ecosystems is highly irregular and can occur at any time of the year, more than once in a year, or can skip a year. The proportion of pixels with two growing seasons was found to be correlated with the average annual precipitation of the study area (p < 0.01), providing an estimation approach of LSP via rainfall. Our study improves the detection and measurement of vegetation phenology in arid and semi-arid regions by improving the spatial extend of LSP retrievals, which contributes to studies on LSP variations and dryland ecosystem resilience to climate change.

However, the contribution of other drivers of the variation in MSWS, including atmospheric circulation and increasing surface air temperature, remains largely unknown. This study integrated statistical methods, spatial mapping techniques, meteorological station data, and land use products to investigate the spatiotemporal influence and integrated contribution rates of surface air temperature, surface roughness, and atmospheric circulation on MSWS in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, China. The annual mean MSWS decreased (-0.662 m<middle dot>s(-1)<middle dot>10a(-1)) during 1973-2011 and increased (0.115 m<middle dot>s(-1)<middle dot>10a(-1)) during 2011-2020, whereas the seasonal changes differed significantly, with changes in the mean MSWS in winter being greater than in the other seasons. Moreover, increases in surface air temperature owing to surface roughness change, as well as atmospheric circulation (annual total explanatory power: 91.2%) contributed to MSWS changes from 1973 to 2020. The explanatory power of the integrated contribution was clearly influenced by urbanization, especially at the high urbanization level in the warm season (>86%), and the influence of atmospheric circulation was higher than that of urbanization in the cold seasons at the moderate level (>83%), implying that atmospheric circulation partially affected the key role of urbanization in the reversal of MSWS. The analysis framework of this study, which is based on the contribution rates of surface air temperature, surface roughness, and atmospheric circulation, is transferable to other cities and can be utilized to assist in both decreasing the risk of urban wind extremes and improving wind resource utilization.																			2212-0955					NOV	2023	52								101713	10.1016/j.uclim.2023.101713	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2023.101713		OCT 2023											WOS:001096481300001

M.			Quantifying the compensatory effect of increased soil temperature under plastic film mulching on crop growing degree days in a wheat-maize rotation system	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Plastic film mulching (PM) has a compensatory effect on crop growing degree days by increasing soil temperature. However, only few studies addressed the question whether a terminal time for the compensatory effect window exists and if it exists how it can be quantified. The objective of this study was to use the logistic equation to describe the cumulative crop plant height and to quantify the compensatory effect. Crop apical meristem emergence was used as the reference for the terminal time of the compensatory effect window. A three-year field experiment (2013-2016), conducted under continuous PM in a typical winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and summer maize (Zea mays L.) rotation on the Loess Plateau, Northwest China, indicated that the logistic equation performed well in representing and quantifying the compensatory effect of PM. The compensatory effect of PM reached a plateau during winter wheat growing seasons due to the lack of increased soil temperature during regreening stage, and during summer maize growing seasons due to unfavorably delayed senescence. The terminal time can be estimated during winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons from thermal time nodes at the maximum slope (t(2)) and second inflection point (t(3)), respectively. The compensatory coefficients could be estimated by thermal time intervals of (0, t(1)) and (t(1), t(2))in winter wheat growing seasons and thermal time internals (0, t(1)), (t(1), t(2)), and (t(2), t(3)) in summer maize growing seasons, respectively.

Epidemic influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B viruses showed a wide range of growth capability (10(4)-10(11) copies/mL) in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. The growth was correlated with the nasopharyngeal viral load (r = 0.53). Six selected strains showed growth-dependent cell death (r = 0.96) in a growth kinetics assay. Epidemic influenza viruses exhibit a wide range of growth capability. Growth capability should be considered one of the key factors in disease prognosis.

Genotypic Variation in Cultivated and Wild Sorghum Genotypes in Response to <i>Striga hermonthica</i> Infestation	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Striga hermonthica is the most important parasitic weed in sub-Saharan Africa and remains one of the most devastating biotic factors affecting sorghum production in the western regions of Kenya. Farmers have traditionally managed Striga using cultural methods, but the most effective and practical solution to poor smallholder farmers is to develop Striga-resistant varieties. This study was undertaken with the aim of identifying new sources of resistance to Striga in comparison with the conventional sources as standard checks. We evaluated 64 sorghum genotypes consisting of wild relatives, landraces, improved varieties, and fourth filial generation (F-4) progenies in both a field trial and a pot trial. Data were collected for days to 50% flowering (DTF), dry panicle weight (DPW, g), plant height (PH, cm), yield (YLD, t ha(-1)), 100-grain weight (HGW, g), overall disease score (ODS), overall pest score (OPS), area under Striga number progress curve (ASNPC), maximum above-ground Striga (NSmax), and number of Striga-forming capsules (NSFC) at relevant stages. Genetic diversity and hybridity confirmation was determined using Diversity Arrays Technology sequencing (DArT-seq). Residual heterosis for HGW and NSmax was calculated as the percent increase or decrease in performance of F-4 crossover midparent (MP). The top 10 best yielding genotypes were predominantly F-4 crosses in both experiments, all of which yielded better than resistant checks, except FRAMIDA in the field trial and HAKIKA in the pot trial. Five F-4 progenies (ICSVIII IN x E36-1, LANDIWHITE x B35, B35 x E36-1, F6YQ212 x B35, and ICSVIII IN x LODOKA) recorded some of the highest HGW in both trials revealing their stability in good performance. Three genotypes (F6YQ212, GBK045827, and F6YQ212xB35) and one check (SRN39) were among the most resistant to Striga in both trials. SNPs generated from DArT-seq grouped the genotypes into three major clusters, with all resistant checks grouping in the same cluster except N13. We identified more resistant and high-yielding genotypes than the conventional checks, especially among the F-4 crosses, which should be promoted for adoption by farmers. Future studies will need to look for more diverse sources of Striga resistance and pyramid different mechanisms of resistance into farmer-preferred varieties to enhance the durability of Striga resistance in the fields of farmers.

K.; Clough, Timothy J.; Hunt, John E.; Whitehead, David			Net ecosystem carbon exchange for Bermuda grass growing in mesocosms as affected by irrigation frequency	PEDOSPHERE												Intensification of grazed grasslands following conversion from dryland to irrigated farming has the potential to alter ecosystem carbon (C) cycling and affect components of carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange that could lead to either net accumulation or loss of soil C. While there are many studies on the effect of water availability on biomass production and soil C stocks, much less is known about the effect of the frequency of water inputs on the components of CO2 exchange. We grew Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon L.) in mesocosms under irrigation frequencies of every day (I-1 treatment, 30 d), every two days (I-2 treatment, 12 d), every three days (I-3 treatment, 30 d), and every six days (I-6 treatment, 18 d, after I-2 treatment). Rates of CO2 exchange for estimating net ecosystem CO2 exchange (F-N), ecosystem respiration (R-E), and soil respiration (R-S) were measured, and gross C uptake by plants (F-G) and respiration from leaves (R-L) were calculated during two periods, 1-12 and 13-30 d, of the 30-d experiment. During the first 12 d, there were no significant differences in cumulative F-N (mean +/- standard deviation, 61 +/- 30 g C m(-2), n = 4). During the subsequent 18 d, cumulative F-N decreased with decreasing irrigation frequency and increasing cumulative soil water deficit (W), with values of 70 +/- 22, 60 +/- 16, and 18 +/- 12 g C m(-2) for the I-1, I-3, and I-6 treatments, respectively. There were similar decreases in F-G, R-E, and R-L with increasing W, but differences in R-S were not significant. Use of the C-4 grass growing in a C-3-derived soil enabled partitioning of R-S into its autotrophic (R-A) and heterotrophic (R-H) components using a C-13 natural abundance isotopic technique at the end of the experiment when differences in cumulative W between the treatments were the greatest. The values of R-H and its percentage contributions to R-S (43% +/- 8%, 42% +/- 8%, and 8% +/- 5% for the I-1, I-3, and I-6 treatments, respectively) suggested that R-H remained unaffected across a wide range of W and then decreased under extreme W. There were no significant differences in aboveground biomass between the treatments. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emission was measured to determine if there was a trade-off effect between irrigation frequency and increasing W on net greenhouse gas emission, but no significant differences were found between the treatments. These findings suggest that over short periods in well-drained soil, irrigation frequency could be managed to manipulate soil water deficit in order to reduce net belowground respiratory C losses, particularly those from the microbial decomposition of soil organic matter, with no significant effect on biomass production and N2O emission.

U.			Spatio-temporal patterns of energy exchange and evapotranspiration during an intense drought for drylands in Brazil	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												The Caatinga biome, located in the northeastern region of Brazil, is the most populated dryland region on the planet and extremely vulnerable to land degradation due to climatological and anthropogenic factors. Energy partitioning substantially influences the local climate and affects the water cycle, which is of utmost importance for the economy and livelihood of the region. Recently, eddy covariance (EC) towers were installed in the area; thus, the scientific community can thoroughly assess the water and energy fluxes over this unique biome. While EC towers have a high degree of accuracy, they only measure energy fluxes over a small land footprint. Given the biome spatial heterogeneity, the use of EC-based techniques has the limitation of not comprehensively representing water and energy fluxes profiles over the entire region. Incorporating remote sensing (RS) data into the landscape analysis is a feasible solution to overcome this issue, given that satellite data can capture the phenomena represented by the EC measurements across large spatial scales. Our research studied the capability of the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and MOD16-ET products to represent the EC measurements regarding energy and mass exchange, with an ultimate objective of applying the best approach to assess these fluxes regionally. We applied the SEBAL model using only remote sensing data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. The MOD16-ET model uses a different approach but is also based on MODIS data. Our analysis was based on three years (2014-2016) of data, which was limited to the availability of the EC tower data. We found that for the EC-based measurements, energy balance closure (EBC) achieved an average of 0.84, which is considerably high for the region. This is possibly due to the EC tower being installed on a preserved Caatinga plot, with reduced heterogeneity and higher plant density. When analyzing RS-based products to represent ET profiles in the region, we found that the SEBAL model accurately represented water fluxes during the wet season but not the dry season, whereas the MOD16-ET showed a better agreement with EC-based water fluxes throughout all the seasons. SEBAL inaccuracy in drylands is partially due to the narrow range between the cold and hot pixels in an image, as the algorithm relies on this range for input parameters, especially in the dry season. Therefore, we concluded that MOD16-ET is capable of better-representing water fluxes in the Caatinga region. We analyzed the fluxes regionally and quantified annual ET for the three years. These results are especially relevant for local policymakers on dealing with water and landscape issues in a region where the livelihood and well-being of the population is inextricably bound to water availability.

Herein, BC and N-doped BC (NBC) with various physicochemical properties were prepared at pyrolysis temperatures of 350, 550 and 750 degrees C (namely BC/NBC350, 550 and 750) and their in-teractions with LMWOAs were systematically investigated. Results of ROS quenching and electrochemical cell experiments revealed that BC/NBC could strongly interact with LMWOAs, especially ascorbic acid (AA), and acted as an electron shuttle to mediate one electron transfer from AA to oxygen to generate O-2(center dot-), followed by the robust generation of H2O2 and center dot OH. Interestingly, the generation rates of center dot OH and H2O2 in the NBC-AA system were significantly higher than that in the BC-AA system, of which the NBC550-AA system exhibited the best performance, enabling its superior ability in bisphenol A degradation. Different from conventional wisdom, the electron shuttle capacity depended on a combined aromatization degree and electron-accepting capacity of BC/ NBC. These findings complement the interfacial electron transfer mechanism during the natural BC-LMWOAs interaction and provide new inspiration for the development of green and efficient organic pollutant removal technologies.																			0304-3894	1873-3336				FEB 15	2024	464								132960	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132960	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132960		NOV 2023						37976848					WOS:001115030000001

In this study, we analyzed the cause of differences in growth capability by evaluating pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IFN-beta) and antiviral interferon-stimulated genes (ISG-15, IFIM1, and TRIM22). A549 cells (3.0 x 10(5) cells) were inoculated with circulating seasonal IAV strains and incubated for 6 and 24 h. In cells inoculated for 6 h, IAV production was assessed using IAV-RNA copies in the culture supernatant and cell pellets to evaluate gene expression. At 24 h post-infection, cells were collected for IFN-beta and ISG-15 protein expression. A549 cells inoculated with seasonal IAV strains with a high growth capability expressed lower levels of IFN-beta and ISGs than strains with low growth capabilities. Moreover, suppression of the JAK/STAT pathway enhanced the viral copies of seasonal IAV strains with a low growth capability. Our results suggest that the expression of ISG-15, IFIM1, and TRIM22 in seasonal IAV-inoculated A549 cells could influence the regulation of viral replication, indicating the existence of strains with high and low growth capability. Our results may contribute to the development of new and effective therapeutic strategies to reduce the risk of severe influenza infections.

The global climate change is further accelerating the process of soil salinization, particularly in dry areas of the world. Increasing genetic variability of currently used wheat varieties by introgression of exotic alleles/genes from related progenitors' species in breeding programs is an efficient approach to overcome limitations due to the absence of valuable genetic diversity in elite cultivars. Synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW) is widely regarded as donor of favourable exotic alleles to improve tolerance against biotic and abiotic stresses such as salinity stress. In this study, synthetic backcross lines (SBLs) winter wheat population "Z86", derived from crosses involving synthetic hexaploid wheat Syn86L with German elite winter wheat cultivar Zentos, was evaluated for salinity tolerance at different developmental stages under controlled and field conditions in three growing seasons. High genetic variability was detected across the SBLs and their parents at various growth stages under controlled as well as under salt stress field trials. Greater performance of Zentos over Syn86L was detected at germination stage across all salt treatments and with respect to shoot dry weight (SDW) and root dry weight (RDW) at seedling stage. Whereas for the root length (RL) and the shoot length (SL) Syn86L surpassed the elite cultivar and most of the progenies. Our experiments revealed for almost all traits that some genotypes among the SBLs showed higher performance than their parents. Furthermore, positive transgressive segregations were detected among the SBLs for germination at high salinity levels, as well as for RDW and SDW at seedling stage. Therefore, the studied Z86 population is a suitable population for assessment of salinity stress on morphological and physiological traits at different plant growth stages. The identified SBLs provide a valuable source for genetic gain through recombination of superior alleles that can be directly applied in breeding programs for efficiently breeding cultivars with improved salinity tolerance and desired agronomic traits.

The ecology and morphology of Australia&apos;s desert turtle (<i>Emydura macquarii emmotti</i>)	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Cooper Creek is one of Australia's largest unregulated river systems and one of the world's most variable large river systems. It is a dynamic environment that oscillates between booms and busts; yet, many species thrive in it. One of these species, the Cooper Creek turtle (Emydura macquarii emmotti) has received little attention, despite being one of Australia's largest freshwater turtles and living further inland than any other Australian turtle. We conducted surveys for E. m. emmotti in 2001-2004, 2019, and 2022, focussing predominantly on the Waterloo waterhole. Waterloo had a large population of E. m. emmotti (508 estimated individuals; 95% CI = 447-596) with an estimated density of 64.8 turtles/ha (95% CI = 57.0-76.2) and estimate biomass of 74.4 kg/ha (95% CI = 57.6-100.3 kg/ha). Juveniles were highly abundant in all years, representing up to 63.6% of captured individuals. It was slightly (but not significantly) male-biased in 2001-2004 and significantly female-biased in 2019. All sizes and sexes used the floodplain during a flooding event in 2022, but more males than females were captured on the floodplain, and there was evidence of male-biased dispersal across the years. Compared to Murray River turtles (Emydura macquarii macquarii), E. m. emmotti exhibited megacephaly across all ages and sexes, with particularly pronounced megacephaly in adult females. Algae were present on many individuals (including on the skin and plastron) but was relatively more abundant on juveniles. Leeches were not detected on any of the 66 turtles that were examined for them. The following injuries/malformations were noted: missing or injured limbs (3.2%), missing or injured eyes (1.3%), damaged shells (8.0%), scute/shell anomalies and malformations (10.6%), and marginal scute seams extending into the costals (67.4% of adults, 1.2% of juveniles). This paper presents some of the first work on this unusual turtle and makes recommendations for future research.																			1442-9985	1442-9993				2023 SEP 25	2023										10.1111/aec.13434	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aec.13434		SEP 2023											WOS:001071478000001

This paper analyzes factors underpinning the adoption of improved groundnut varieties among farmers to pave the way for upscaling quality seed used for increased production and commodity business in farming communities. A four-stage stratified sampling was used to collect data from 300 groundnut farmers in seven agro-ecological zones through individual interviews. Secondary data were collected from the literature and the Tanzania Agricultural Research Institute at Naliendele centre (TARI-Naliendele). Descriptive statistics and Probit regression model were used for data analysis. The empirical results showed that Johari 1985, Pendo 1998, Naliendele 2009, Mnanje 2009, Mangaka 2009 and Nachi 2015, are the main six improved groundnut varieties used by farmers, with Pendo 1998 having the highest adoption rate (17.1%). In the grain market, four varieties, namely Pendo 1998, Mnanje 2009, Nachi 2015 and Johari 1985, were observed to be highly preferred by grain off-takers. Furthermore, among the adopted improved varieties, Nachi 2015, is observed to be the most consistent high yielding variety, ranging from 1100 kg/ha to 1500 kg/ha in all agro-ecological zones. A farmer's decision to adopt new varieties is affected by age and gender, farmer group membership, availability of improved seed and seed cost. Overall, male farmers are more likely to adopt improved varieties of groundnut than female farmers. The implications of these findings are also discussed, in particular in the area of policy support.

Reclaimed water plays an important role in maintaining the sustainable use of urban water resources, especially in arid regions. In this paper, a system dynamics urban reclaimed water model (SDURWM) considering the status of arid regions in northwestern China was constructed. The supply and demand balance index (RWB) and the utilization efficiency index (RWUE) of reclaimed water were proposed as evaluation indicators. The potential of reclaimed water utilization (2016-2025) in three typical cities with similar natural environments and population sizes but with large economic differences were estimated by the SD model. Then the relevant values of reclaimed water quota, supply and resident awareness were adjusted within the range of 10%-20%. The predicted results from intervention demonstrate that the RWB of three cities will be closer or maintain to the ideal value, and that the RWUE will increase by about 0.1, compared with the non-intervention results. This indicates that a minor change of the targeted policies can invigorate the capacity of reclaimed water use in droughty cities. This paper provides some effective solutions for the government's planning of developing the potential of reclaimed water.					jiang, xiaohui/GWZ-4110-2022	jiang, xiaohui/0000-0002-3805-5766													0301-4797	1095-8630				SEP 15	2020	270								110878	10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110878	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110878								32721317					WOS:000554920300062

This research investigated dietary diversity and food choice drivers among low-income consumers in three urban settlements (Nairobi, Kenya; Bulawayo, Zimbabwe and Lilongwe, Malawi, representing rapid, moderate and slow urban growth patterns, respectively) as a first step towards improving diets across cultures and geographies.MethodsMixed methods data collection was employed for this study. Qualitative methods such as rapid foodscape appraisal workshops and food stories in selected low-income settlements in Nairobi, Bulawayo and Lilongwe were utilised to collect information on the food environments (food balances, infrastructure, safety, policies and institutions). Quantitative data such as socio-demographic characteristics and dietary diversity were collected via structured questionnaires using Cognitive Edge's SenseMaker (R) (n = 890, 450 and 440 for Nairobi, Bulawayo and Lilongwe, respectively). The dietary intake of respondents was assessed using a 24-h recall, which was then converted to the food group diversity score (FGDS).ResultsDifferent levels of compounded stress affected dietary diversity and quality, including high food prices, concerns about sanitation and hygiene and the role of food standards regulation bodies. The mean FGDS across all locations was lower than the recommended cut-off of 5 (4.5, 2.8 and 2.6 across Nairobi, Zimbabwe and Lilongwe, respectively). Additionally, in Nairobi, there were gender differences in diet diversity, with men having a higher dietary diversity score than women (4.6% vs. 4.3%; p = 0.004). The majority of respondents in Lilongwe (65%) reported price as the most important driver of food choice, compared to 38% in Nairobi and 42% in Bulawayo.Discussion/ConclusionsOur observation of poor-quality diets provides further evidence of the need for food policies that are cognisant of the nutrition and health of the growing population of the urban poor. Such policies would focus on lowering the costs of nutritious foods as well as ensuring food safety within the complex food system observed in the urban low-income environment. Using a theoretical framework that assessed demographic characteristics and various food environments, we determined drivers of diet diversity and food choice in selected low-income settlements in Nairobi (Kenya), Bulawayo (Zimbabwe) and Lilongwe (Malawi). Overall, all respondents identified their change in attitude as an important driver of dietary diversification. From the Nairobi responses, convenience (40% of respondents) was the main factor influencing food choice, whereas price was the most important factor in Bulawayo (31% of respondents) and Lilongwe (67% of respondents). Price and convenience are important factors to consider for improving diet diversity in urban low-income settlements. Our findings can potentially guide future nutrition interventions and dietetic practice towards stimulating healthier eating behaviour and sustainable diets more appropriately.image An investigation conducted in contrasting food environments in three urban low-income settlements in Lilongwe, Bulawayo and Nairobi suggests low consumption of nutrient-dense foods, such as fruits and animal-source foods.Several drivers of dietary diversity and food choice, as well as perceptions, were identified. Price and convenience were identified as key drivers of food choice, with gender differences reported in dietary diversity.Policies and programmes need to consider steering diets towards higher consumption of nutrient-dense foods while taking into account price, convenience and environmental sustainability.																			0952-3871	1365-277X				2023 OCT 5	2023										10.1111/jhn.13244	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jhn.13244		OCT 2023						37798958					WOS:001076128200001

Culturally-tailored cookbook for promoting positive dietary change among hypertensive Filipino Americans: a pilot study	FRONTIERS IN NUTRITION												Introduction: Among all Asian American subgroups, Filipino-Americans have consistently been shown to have the highest rates of hypertension, raising risks of heart attack and stroke. Despite this alarming fact, little has been done to investigate culturally-sensitive interventions to control hypertension rates in this vulnerable population. To address the lack of culturally-relevant lifestyle options for blood pressure management currently available to the Filipino community, this exploratory pilot study used a design thinking approach informed by culinary medicine to develop a culturally-tailored, heart-healthy, and low sodium recipe cookbook for Filipino Americans with hypertension and evaluate its feasibility as a hypertension intervention. Methods: Our team developed a cookbook using participatory methods and design thinking, utilizing input from five Filipino culinary experts and a Registered Dietitian. The cookbook incorporates traditional Filipino recipes, excerpts from community members' interviews, and nutrient analyses. Twenty Filipinx-identifying individuals* who self-reported physician-diagnosed hypertension were recruited from Filipino community-based organizations, enrolled into this study, provided with the cookbook, and asked to cook at least one recipe. Pre- and post-intervention surveys were conducted and centered around behavior change and features of the cookbook. Results: This study provided evidence for the cookbook's acceptability and feasibility, with participants' open-ended responses revealing that the recipes, nutrition labels, illustrations, and cultural aspects of the cookbook increased motivation to achieve dietary change, including reducing sodium in their diet to improve their blood pressure. Participant responses also indicated positive behavior change as a result of using the cookbook, with participants reporting increased likelihood of adopting recommended actions to lower their BP after utilizing the cookbook ((x) over bar = 80.83%), compared to before ((x) over bar = 63.75%, p < 0.008), according to Hypertension Self-Care Management scaled scores. Discussion: In conclusion, the results of this pilot study demonstrated acceptability of this unique cookbook and provide preliminary findings consistent with increased motivation in participants to make dietary changes and improve personal health, drawing attention to the importance of considering future culturally-tailored health interventions. Next steps should include a robust, randomized controlled trial design comparing measured blood pressure outcomes of an intervention vs. control group. *Filipinx is an inclusive term representing the gender identities of all participants in our study.																			2296-861X					APR 20	2023	10								1114919	10.3389/fnut.2023.1114919	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2023.1114919								37153920					WOS:000981901900001

Scaled biomass estimation in woodland ecosystems: Testing the individual and combined capacities of satellite multispectral and lidar data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data enable accurate modeling and mapping of aboveground biomass (AGB), but the limited spatial and temporal extents of ALS data collection limit the capacity for broad-scale carbon accounting. Conversely, while space-based remote sensing instruments provide increased spatial and temporal coverage, it can be difficult to directly link field-level vegetation biometrics to satellite data due to coarser spatial resolution and positional uncertainty. The combined use of ALS and satellite remote sensing data may offer a solution to efficient, accurate, and consistent AGB mapping across time and space. Such airborne-spaceborne data fusion has been demonstrated successfully in high-biomass settings; however, the unique structural conditions of dryland woodland ecosystems, with open canopies and low leaf area indices, pose mapping challenges that require further study. These challenges are particularly acute with large footprint spaceborne lidar, where short, widely-spaced trees may limit the capacity for accurate AGB estimation. In this study, we present a scaled methodological framework for linking field-measured woodland AGB to ALS data and, in turn, linking ALSmodeled AGB to satellite data, using pin similar to on-juniper woodlands in southeastern Utah as a case study. We compare the effectiveness of this scaling approach using two satellite sensors, Landsat 8 OLI (multispectral) and GEDI (lidar). Since the predicted outputs of our local-scale model are being used as inputs to our regional-scale model, we also demonstrate an approach for propagating uncertainty throughout this nested, multiscale analytical framework, leveraging the inherent variability within a random forest's decision trees. Given the positional uncertainty of GEDI footprints, we test a range of different footprint sizes for their relative effects on ALS-GEDI AGB model accuracy. Our local-scale (field-ALS) predictive model was able to account for 74% of variance in AGB, and estimate AGB with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 14 Mg/ha, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 11.09 Mg/ha. Our regional-scale (ALS-Landsat/GEDI) analysis with propagated uncertainty revealed that the combined use of Landsat and GEDI metrics produced the best predictive model (R2 = 0.68; RMSE = 12.71 Mg/ha; MAE = 9.40 Mg/ha), followed by Landsat-only metrics (R2 = 0.66, RMSE = 13.08 Mg/ha; MAE = 9.71 Mg/ha), and GEDI-only metrics (R2 = 0.49, RMSE = 16.01 Mg/ha; MAE = 12.14 Mg/ha). These results suggest that Landsat may be better-suited than GEDI for estimating AGB in woodland environments where low canopy covers and short trees limit the capacity for precisely characterizing vegetation structure within largefootprint, waveform lidar data. The footprint size analysis revealed that larger simulated footprints (e.g., 30 m radius and greater) produced higher GEDI model accuracies; however, increasing footprint radii beyond 30 m does not significantly increase model accuracy. This research represents an important step forward in improving our capacity for reliably mapping woodland AGB, and provides an early test case for the application of GEDI data to woodland AGB mapping.

A previous study showed that DREB transcription factor gene GmDREB3 from soybean can improve drought resistance in tobacco, however, whether it can improve drought resistance in wheat needs to be further investigated. In the present study, GmDREB3 was transferred to a wheat variety, Shi366 and two positive lines of the T-5 generation were obtained by additive culture and molecular identification. GmDREB3-OE (overexpression) lines conferred drought tolerance characteristics, including higher survival rates, lower malondialdehyde (MDA) content, lower relative conductivity, higher chlorophyll content, and higher proline content than Shi366 wheat plants under drought stress. The SPAD, Fv/Fm, panicle number, and grain yield of GmDREB3-OE lines were increased but the transpiration rate was decreased, compared to the Shi366 plants in the field condition under drought stress. Significant differences in the stress indices were observed between the GmDREB3-OE lines and Shi366 wheat plants, which suggested that the GmDREB3 significantly improved wheat tolerance to drought stress. In addition, RT-qPCR analysis indicated that GmDREB3 could enhance the expression of drought-related genes in wheat. Therefore, GmDREB3 significantly increased drought tolerance in wheat plants along with improved physiological and agronomic traits and grain yield.

J	Shi, J; Sun, YZ; Wang, X; Wang, J				Shi, Jia; Sun, Yuanze; Wang, Xiang; Wang, Jie			Microplastics reduce soil microbial network complexity and ecological deterministic selection	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Microplastics have been proposed as emerging threats for terrestrial systems as they may potentially alter the physicochemical/biophysical soil environments. Due to the variety of properties of microplastics and soils, the microplastic-induced effects in soil ecosystems are greatly manifold. Here, we studied effects of three polymer microplastics (polyamide-6, polyethylene, and polyethylene terephthalate) on soil properties with four different soil types. The success patterns, interaction relationships, and assembly processes of soil bacterial communities were also studied. Microplastics have the potential to promote CO2 emissions and enhance the soil humification. Even though microplastics did not significantly alter the diversity and composition of the soil microbial community, the application of microplastics decreased the network complexity and stability, including network size, connectivity, and the number of module and keystone species. The bacterial community assembly was governed by deterministic selection (77.3%-90.9%) in all treatments, while microplastics increased the contribution of stochastic processes from 9.1% in control to 13.6%-22.7%. The neutral model results also indicated most of the bacterial taxa were present in the predicted neutral region (approximately 98%), suggesting the importance of stochastic processes. These findings provided a fundamental insight in understanding the effects of microplastics on soil ecosystems.

J	Sow, A; Soti, V; Thiaw, I; Brévault, T				Sow, Ahmadou; Soti, Valerie; Thiaw, Ibrahima; Brevault, Thierry			Non-crop habitats concurrently drive crop colonization by the millet head miner and regulation by natural enemies	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												Non-crop habitats, depending on their composition, can enhance the abundance and diversity of natural enemies of crop pests, but also at the same time provide resources to pests, thereby reducing the effect on pest incidence and resulting yield losses. The objective of the present study was to test (1) the effect of semi-natural habitats in the landscape on crop colonization by pests and natural regulation, and (2) the relationship between natural regulation and pest incidence. The pearl millet head miner (MHM) was selected as a case study because it is a key pest of millet cultivated in traditional pesticide-free tree-crop agroforestry systems in which its control mostly relies on the action of natural enemies. A set of 24 millet fields were selected in a 20x20 km area in Senegal, from the analysis of high-resolution satellite images (Pleiades), and hypotheses on the relative abundance of semi-natural habitats (here trees and rangelands) in the agricultural landscape. Millet fields were monitored for pest infestation of panicles and pest natural regulation. We used partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-PM) to evaluate the relationships between the abundance and diversity of semi-natural habitats at the landscape scale, crop colonization, natural pest regulation, and pest incidence. Panicle colonization by the MHM was generally high (14-92%) and increased with the abundance of trees and to a lesser extent with the rangeland area at a 1000 m-radius around millet fields. However, regulation provided by natural enemies was amplified by the abundance of trees at a local scale (250 m-radius around millet fields). This was particularly true at early crop colonization of the MHM with parasitism and direct predation on eggs and young larvae. This multi-scale effect of semi-natural habitats on crop colonization and natural regulation could explain why no clear relationship between crop colonization and pest incidence, nor natural regulation and pest incidence, was observed. Future studies on the identification of complex species-specific interactions between trees and natural enemies should provide a better understanding of the ecological processes underlying the performance of natural regulation of MHM populations.

We have employed multiple regression time series analysis of secondary data to understand factors that influence the monthly volumes of small ruminants (sheep and goats) and cattle traded for export in three terminal markets in Somaliland. Results show that the Hajj season, number of livestock exporters active in the markets, market location and livestock ban imposed by the import countries are the main factors that influence the monthly volume of livestock transacted for export. Further, the results indicate that though drought does not influence the volume of small ruminants, it has an influence on the volume of cattle, while the implementation of quarantine stations has a significant influence on the volumes of livestock exports. Finally, border restrictions imposed by Ethiopia do not influence the volume of livestock transacted for export in the study markets. Most of the factors analysed to have influence on monthly volume livestock transacted for export are institutional and policy-related hence can be corrected though requisite regulatory, institutional and policy reforms in consultations with stakeholders.

J	Gumma, MK; Nelson, A; Yamano, T				Gumma, Murali Krishna; Nelson, Andrew; Yamano, Takashi			Mapping drought-induced changes in rice area in India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Rice is a staple food crop of India and is grown on 44 Mha (2011-12), 58.6% of which are irrigated. An inevitable phenomenon which looms over all aspects of human life and affects rice production in India is drought. Assessing drought damage using geospatial datasets available in the public domain, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), can provide specific and local ecoregion information for developing drought-resistant rice varieties. Based on multi-temporal NDVI data and field observations in 2009, we developed a methodology to identify and map drought-affected areas in India. A long-term (10-year) average of NDVI during the rainy (kharif) season (June-October) was compared with NDVI from a known drought year (2002-03) to identify changes in rice area. Rainfall data from the Tropical Rainfall Monitoring Mission (TRMM) was used to support the drought analysis. Spectral matching techniques were used to categorise the drought-affected rice areas into three classes - severe, moderate, and mild based on the intensity of damage assessed through field sampling. Based on these ground survey samples, spectral signatures were generated. It was found that the rice area was about 16% less in the drought year (2002-03) than in a normal year (2000-01). A comparison of the MODIS-derived rice area affected by drought in 2002 for each state and district against the difference in the kharif season harvested rice area between 2000 and 2002 (from official statistics) revealed a substantial difference in harvested area in 2002 that was largely attributable to drought. An 84.7% correlation was found between the MODIS-derived drought-affected area in 2002 and the reduction in harvested area from 2000-01 to 2002-03. Good spatial correlation was found between the drought-affected rice areas and reduction of rice harvested areas in different rice ecologies, indicating the usefulness of such geospatial datasets in assessing abiotic stress such as drought and its consequences.

This nutrient is especially limiting in the dry and low fertility soils where pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br] is typically grown. Globally, pearl millet is the sixth most important cereal grown by subsistence farmers in the arid and semi-arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent. Most of these agro-ecologies have low N in the root zone soil strata. Therefore, there is an immense need to identify lines that use nitrogen efficiently. A set of 380 diverse pearl millet lines consisting of a global diversity panel (345), parents of mapping populations (20), and standard checks (15) were evaluated in an alpha-lattice design with two replications, 25 blocks, a three-row plot for 11 nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) related traits across three growing seasons (Summer 2017, Rainy 2017, and Summer 2018) in an N-depleted precision field under three different N levels (0%-N-0, 50%-N-50, 100%-N-100 of recommended N, i.e., 100 kg ha(-1)). Analysis of variance revealed significant genetic variation for NUE-related traits across treatments and seasons. Nitrogen in limited condition (N-0) resulted in a 27.6 and 17.6% reduction in grain yield (GY) and dry stover yield (DSY) compared to N-50. Higher reduction in GY and DSY traits by 24.6 and 23.6% were observed under N-0 compared to N-100. Among the assessed traits, GY exhibited significant positive correlations with nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUtE) and nitrogen harvest index (NHI). This indicated the pivotal role of N remobilization to the grain in enhancing yield levels. Top 25 N-insensitive (NIS-top grain yielders) and N-sensitive (NS-poor grain yielders) genotypes were identified under low N conditions. Out of 25 NIS lines, nine genotypes (IP 10820, IP 17720, ICMB 01222-P1, IP 10379, ICMB 89111-P2, IP 8069, ICMB 90111-P2, ICMV IS89305, and ICMV 221) were common with the top 25 lines for N-100 level showing the genotype plasticity toward varying N levels. Low N tolerant genotypes identified from the current investigation may help in the identification of genomic regions responsible for NUE and its deployment in pearl millet breeding programs through marker-assisted selection (MAS).

Of 4,448 isolates from 11 consecutive years, 237 isolates could be categorized into 57 strain groups with identical hemagglutinin genes, which were monitored for the entire duration of an epidemic season. In addition, 35 isolates with identical sequences were identified at the study site and in other countries within 147 days. Consequently, it can be postulated that once an influenza virus enters a temperate region, the strain rarely mutates before the end of the season.

Agricultural management can directly or indirectly affect SOM content and associated soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. The SOM content and crop productivity are generally low in the farmlands in the arid and semi-arid regions of China, and are highly sensitive to climate changes. An improvement in SOM content may greatly enhance the efficiency of fertilizer and water use, thereby increasing the resilience of agricultural systems to climate change. However, little information is available on the response of SOM to the interactions of cultivation measures and changing climate in the regions. Here we analyzed the effects of climate and long-term management practices on SOM content at three sites in the arid and semi-arid regions of China using the SOM data monitored under a range of management practices. We showed that the manure application, crop residue return and no-tillage had significantly increased SOM content from 12.1% to 127.5% in the long-term experiment at three sites. We also used the DayCent model to simulate the effects of these management practices in combination with future climate changes on the SOM content, and found that climate changes in the near future would not increase SOM content, and even decrease SOM content under conventional agronomic management, but the possible adverse impact of climate change on SOM can be outweighed by the enhancement of agronomic management. Our results provide important information for improving management to maintain SOM content and sustainable production under future climate changes.

This study was carried out to test the newly developed open-pollinated varieties (OPVs) for field performance and stability for grain yield, grain iron (Fe), and grain zinc (Zn) contents across 10 locations in West Africa (i.e., Niger, Nigeria, Mali, Burkina Faso, Senegal, and Ghana). The test material consisted of 30 OPVs, of which 8 are Fe/Zn biofortified. The experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design in three replications. ANOVA revealed highly significant variability for grain yield and micronutrient traits. The presence of genotype x environment (G x E) indicated that the expressions of traits are significantly influenced by both genetic and G x E factors, for grain Fe and Zn contents. Days to 50% flowering and plant height showed less G x E, suggesting these traits are largely under genetic control. The genotypes CHAKTI (46 days), ICTP 8203 (46 days), ICMV 177002 (50 days), ICMV 177003 (48 days), and Moro (53 days) had exhibited early flowering across locations leading to early physiological maturity. CHAKTI (1.42 t/ha yield; 62.24 mg/kg of grain Fe, 47.29 mg/kg of grain Zn) and ICMP 177002 (1.19 t/ha yield, 62.62 mg/kg of grain Fe, 46.62 mg/kg of grain Zn) have performed well for grain yield and also for micronutrients, across locations, compared with the check. Additive Main Effect and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) ANOVA revealed the highly significant genotypic differences, the mean sum of squares of environment, and its interaction with the genotypes. Based on the AMMI stability value (ASV), the most stable genotype is SOSAT-C88 (ASV = 0.04) for grain yield and resistance to downy mildew; mean grain yield and stability rankings (YSI) revealed that the genotypes CHAKTI, SOSAT-C88, and ICMV IS 99001 were high yielding and expressed stability across regions. The strong correlation (r = 0.98*) of grain Fe and Zn contents that merits Fe-based selection is highly rewarding. CHAKTI outperformed over other genotypes for grain yield (71% higher), especially with early maturing varieties in West Africa, such as GB 8735, LCIC 9702, and Jirani, and for grain Fe (16.11% higher) and Zn (7% higher) contents across locations, and made a candidate of high-iron variety to be promoted for combating the micronutrient malnutrition in West and Central Africa (WCA).

J	Sangwan, N; Kumar, S				Sangwan, Nikita; Kumar, Shalander			Labor force participation of rural women and the household's nutrition: Panel data evidence from SAT India	FOOD POLICY												This paper investigates the role of women's labor force participation in the household's dietary diversity and the value of home-production. Using unique household panel data from Semi-Arid tropics of India, empirical estimations from a household fixed effects model reveal a positive significant effect of workdays of women on dietary diversity (overall and home-produced) and home-production. Our findings highlight a significant heterogeneity in the effect by type of work-paid and unpaid. The results for paid work are driven by a greater decision-making power emanating from labor force participation of women. Unpaid work, on the other hand, operates through the self-consumption of home-produced goods. We show that correcting for endogenous labor force participation of women leaves our conclusions unchanged. The results suggest that interventions boosting female labor force participation in paid activities are nutrition enhancing for the household and work towards improving women's bargaining power within the household. Moreover, we rule out deleterious effects on health indicators of women despite increased time burden.

Moench) is the staple cereal and is the primary source of protein for millions of people in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Sorghum grain value has been increasing in tropical countries including India owing to its gluten-free nature, anti-oxidant properties and low glycemic index. However, the nutrient composition of modern cultivars is declining thus necessitating genetic biofortification of sorghum to combat malnutrition and improve nutritional balance in the human diet. Keeping this in view, efforts were made to utilize valuable alleles, associated with nutrient composition, that might have been left behind in the varietal development in sorghum. The study aimed to determine the genetic improvement for nine nutritional and quality parameters (crude protein, in vitro protein digestibility (IVPD), total iron (Fe), total zinc (Zn), bioavailable Fe (%), bioavailable Zn (%), total phenolics, tannins and antioxidant activity) in the grains of 19 sorghum genotypes (high yield, drought and grain mold tolerant) developed from 11 superior India's landraces. After selection and advancement made from 2017 to 2022 through single seed descent method, the improvement in the nine nutritional and quality parameters was assessed. Significant variation was observed for all the nine parameters among the landraces and the genotypes. Sorghum genotypes PYPS 2 and PYPS 13 recorded the highest crude protein (13.21 and 12.80% respectively) and IVPD (18.68 and 19.56% respectively). Majority of the sorghum genotypes recorded high Fe (14.21-28.41 mg/100 g) and Zn (4.81-8.16 mg/100 g). High phenolics and antioxidant activity were recorded in sorghum genotypes PYPS 18 (85.65 mg/g gallic acid equivalents) and PYPS 19 (89.78%) respectively. Selections through SSD method revealed highest improvement in genotype PYPS 10 for crude protein (32.25%), total phenolics (18.48%) and antioxidant activity (15.43%). High improvements in genotypes PYPS 12 (23.50%), PYPS 3 (26.79%), PYPS 15 (21.18%) were recorded for total Fe, available Fe and high tannins, respectively. The study demonstrated that landraces could be effectively utilized as a potential, low-cost and eco-friendly approach in sorghum genetic biofortification to improved sorghum productivity and nutritional supply in semi-arid tropics.																			2296-861X					OCT 9	2023	10								1228422	10.3389/fnut.2023.1228422	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2023.1228422								37876619					WOS:001090273900001

Soil application of biochar and straw alone or their combinations with nitrogen (N) fertilizer are becoming increasingly common, but little is known about their agronomic and environmental performance in semiarid environments. This study was conducted to investigate the effect(s) of these amendments on soil properties, nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions and grain and biomass yield of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and to produce background dataset that may be used to inform nutrient management guidelines for semiarid environments. Methods. The experiment involved the application of biochar, straw or urea (46% nitrogen [N]) alone or their combinations. The treatments were: CN0-control (zero amendment), CN50 -50 kg ha(-1) N, CN100 -100 kg ha(-1) N, BN0 -15 t ha(-1) biochar, BN50 -15 t ha(-1) biochar + 50 kg ha-1 N, BN100 -15 t ha(-1) biochar + 100 kg ha(-1) N, SN0 -4.5 t ha(-1) straw, SN50 -4.5 t ha(-1) straw + 50 kg ha(-1) N and SN100 -4.5 t ha(-1) straw + 100 kg ha(-1) N. Fluxes of N2O, CH4 and grain yield were monitored over three consecutive cropping seasons between 2014 and 2016 using the static chamber-gas chromatography method. Results. On average, BN100 reported the highest grain yield (2054 kg ha(-1)), which was between 25.04% and 38.34% higher than all other treatments. In addition, biomass yield was much higher under biochar treated plots relative to the other treatments. These findings are supported by the increased in soil organic C by 17.14% and 21.65% in biochar amended soils (at 0-10 cm) compared to straw treated soils and soils without carbon respectively. The BN100 treatment also improved bulk density and hydraulic properties (P < 0.05), which supported the above results. The greatest N2O emissions and CH4 sink were recorded under the highest rate of N fertilization (100 kg N ha(-1)). Cumulative N2O emissions were 39.02% and 48.23% lower in BN100 compared with CN0 and CN100, respectively. There was also a approximate to 37.53% reduction in CH4 uptake under BN100 compared with CN0-control and CN50. The mean cumulative N2O emission from biochar treated soils had a significant decrease of 10.93% and 38.61% compared to straw treated soils and soils without carbon treatment, respectively. However, differences between mean cumulative N2O emission between straw treated soils and soils without carbon were not significant. These results indicate the dependency of crop yield, N2O and CH4 emissions on soil quality and imply that crop productivity could be increased without compromising on environmental quality when biochar is applied in combination with N-fertilizer. The practice of applying biochar with N fertilizer at 100 kg ha(-1) N resulted in increases in crop productivity and reduced N2O and CH4 soil emissions under dryland cropping systems.

However, few studies have been done on the pathogenicity of C. javanica to aphids. Using a virulence assay, we studied the entomopathogenic fungus C. javanica IJ-tg19, which has high virulence to the aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) (Hemiptera: Aphididae). We compared conidial germination and activity of cuticle-degrading enzyme (subtilisin-like serine protease (Pr1) and chitinase) of C. javanica IJ-tg19 with the entomopathogenic strains Cordyceps fumosorosea (Wize) (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae) IF-1106 and Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae) BB-1339. The infection process of C. javanica IJ-tg19 strain to A. pisum was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that germination time of conidia of C. javanica IJ-tg19 and C. fumosorosea IF-1106 was shorter than that of B. bassiana BB-1339, and the germination rate was significantly higher than the BB-1339 strain. The germ tube of IJ-tg19 was accompanied by mucilage secretion during the body surface germination of A. pisum. The activity of total Pr1 and chitinase of IJ-tg19 reached their highest values at 48 h post-inoculation (PI), and the activities were significantly higher than those of IF-1106 and BB-1339. SEM and TEM observations showed that the infection peak was at 24 h PI, and mycelia had entered the hemocoel cavity of A. pisum at 48 h. These results indicate that C. javanica IJ-tg19 has several desirable attributes to act as an effective agent for the biological control of aphids.

However, it is not clear whether the gully headcut migration is affected by root distribution and soil properties. Five representative gullies developed in different land uses were selected to clarify the variations of root distribution and soil properties and their effects on headcut migration in the rainy season (May to October 2021) in the Mollisols region of northeast China. Results showed that the 68.4%-93.3% of root mass density and 65.6-88.5% of root length density were concentrated in 0-30 cm soil layer of gully heads, and the roots of 85%. The gullies developed in farmlands had relatively higher soil compactness, shear strength and aggregate stability, but lower organic matter (OMC), disintegration capacity and soil permeability than those developed in woodlands, unpaved roads in farmland and stable gully-beds. Changes in soil properties of gully heads were closely related to root density. The linear, areal, and volumetric migration rate of gully heads varied greatly and were 1.07-35.11 m yr(-1), 28.95-562.46 m(2) yr(-1) and 56.82-6626.37 m(3) yr(-1), respectively, with the average of 9.07 m yr(-1), 156.92 m(2) yr(-1) and 1503.02 m(3) yr(-1), respectively. The change in headcut migration rate was significantly affected by root density, soil properties and drainage area, of which soil texture, OMC, soil aggregate structure, and the drainage area were the critical factors influencing headcut migration in the Mollisols region of northeast China.

This study was performed to clarify whether pyrazosulfuron-methyl can be used in foxtail millet fields and the effect of pyrazosulfuron-methyl on the photosynthetic performance of foxtail millet. Two foxtail millet varieties (Jingu 21 and Zhangzagu 10) were subjected to five doses (0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 g ai ha(-1)) of pyrazosulfuron-methyl in pot and field experiments. The plant height, leaf area, stem diameter, photosynthetic pigment contents, gas exchange parameters, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, antioxidant enzyme activities, and antioxidant contents at 7 and 15 days after pyrazosulfuron-methyl application, and the yield of foxtail millet were measured. The results suggested that pyrazosulfuron-methyl inhibited the growth of foxtail millet and reduced the photosynthetic pigment contents, photosynthetic rate, and photosynthetic system II activity. Similarly, pyrazosulfuron-methyl decreased the antioxidant enzyme activities and antioxidant contents. These results also indicated that the toxicity of pyrazosulfuron-methyl to foxtail millet was decreased gradually with the extension of time after application; however, the foxtail millet yield was still significantly reduced. Therefore, pyrazosulfuron-methyl is not recommended for application in foxtail millet fields.																			1664-462X					AUG 5	2021	12								696169	10.3389/fpls.2021.696169	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.696169								34421947					WOS:000685032400009

Application of a satellite-retrieved sheltering parameterization (v1.0) for dust event simulation with WRF-Chem v4.1	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												Roughness features (e.g., rocks, vegetation, furrows) that shelter or attenuate wind flow over the soil surface can considerably affect the magnitude and spatial distribution of sediment transport in active aeolian environments. Existing dust and sediment transport models often rely on vegetation attributes derived from static land use datasets or remotely sensed greenness indicators to incorporate sheltering effects on simulated particle mobilization. However, these overly simplistic approaches do not represent the three-dimensional nature or spatiotemporal changes of roughness element sheltering. They also ignore the sheltering contribution of non-vegetation roughness features and photosynthetically inactive (i.e., brown) vegetation common to dryland environments. Here, we explore the use of a novel albedo-based sheltering parameterization in a dust transport modeling application of the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). The albedo method estimates sheltering effects on surface wind friction speeds and dust entrainment from the shadows cast by subgrid-scale roughness elements. For this study, we applied the albedo-derived drag partition to the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) dust emission module and conducted a sensitivity study on simulated PM10 concentrations using the Georgia Institute of Technology-Goddard Global Ozone Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) model as implemented in WRF-Chem v4.1. Our analysis focused on a convective dust event case study from 3-4 July 2014 for the southwestern United States desert region discussed by other published works. Previous studies have found that WRF-Chem simulations grossly overestimated the dust transport associated with this event. Our results show that removing the default erodibility map and adding the drag parameterization to the AFWA dust module markedly improved the overall magnitude and spatial pattern of simulated dust conditions for this event. Simulated PM10 values near the leading edge of the storm substantially decreased in magnitude (e.g., maximum PM10 values were reduced from 17 151 to 8539 mu g m-3), bringing the simulated results into alignment with the observed PM10 measurements. Furthermore, the addition of the drag partition restricted the erroneous widespread dust emission of the original model configuration. We also show that similar model improvements can be achieved by replacing the wind friction speed parameter in the original dust emission module with globally scaled surface wind speeds, suggesting that a well-tuned constant could be used as a substitute for the albedo-based product for short-duration simulations in which surface roughness is not expected to change and for landscapes wherein roughness is constant over years to months. Though this alternative scaling method requires less processing, knowing how to best tune the model winds a priori could be a considerable challenge. Overall, our results demonstrate how dust transport simulation and forecasting with the AFWA dust module can be improved in vegetated drylands by calculating the dust emission flux with surface wind friction speed from a drag partition treatment.

This study incorporated the DSSAT-CERES-Maize model with a new algorithm for dynamic within-season irrigation scheduling for maize (Zea mays L.) based on trends in daily forecasted yields. Field experiments were undertaken at four arid and semiarid sites in Northwest China, including Changwu (2010 and 2011, rainfed), Yangling (2014 and 2015, irrigated), Jingyang (2015, irrigated), and Shiyanghe (2015, irrigated). Historical 50-year (1968-2017) weather data were available for each site. In daily yield forecasts, weather data before forecast dates were observed from local weather stations, while the unknown data between forecast and harvest dates were supplemented by local 50-year continuous weather series in the same periods. Then 50 maize yields could be obtained on each forecast day, and the median values were calculated as the prediction on that day. As the growing season advanced, historical weather data were gradually replaced by actual weather data. Further, the dynamics of daily forecasted yields were used to schedule irrigation based on a new algorithm. The new algorithm schedule irrigations by considering the feedbacks of maize grain yield to interactions of actual weather, environment, and management. The results showed that forecasted maize yield had considerable uncertainty before tasseling but rapidly converged to the actual yield about one month before harvest. The mean absolute relative errors (MAREs) of daily forecasted yields were 11.7% and 7.3% at Changwu in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Simulated irrigation use efficiency (IUE) for almost all sites and years were improved. The new irrigation scheduling algorithm will help to improve irrigation scheduling in arid and semiarid areas where precipitation is the main limited factor to maize yield.

D.; Tshingomba, Urcel Kalenga; Soti, Valerie			Assessing Worldview-3 multispectral imaging abilities to map the tree diversity in semi-arid parklands	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Semi-arid parkland agrosystems are strongly sensitive to climate change and anthropic pressure. In the context of sustainability research, trees are considered critical for various ecosystem services covering environment quality as well as food security and health. But their actual ecological impact on both cropland and natural vegetation is not well understood yet, and collecting spatial and structural information around agroforestry systems is becoming an important issue. Tree mapping in semi-arid parklands could be one of these prerequisites. While for obtaining an exhaustive inventory of individual trees and for analysing their spatial distribution, remote sensing is the ideal tool. However, it has been noted that depending on the spatial resolution and sensor spectral characteristics, tree species cannot be distinguished clearly, even in the sparsely vegetated semi-arid ecosystems of West Africa. Thus, this work focuses on assessing the capabilities of Worldview-3 imagery, acquired in 8 spectral bands, to detect, delineate, and identify certain key tree species in the Faidherbia albida parkland in Bambey, Senegal, based on a ground-truth database corresponding to 5000 trees. The tree crowns are delineated through NDVI thresholding and consecutive filtering to provide object-based radiometric signatures, radiometric indices, and textural information. A factorial discriminant analysis is then performed, which indicates that only four out of the seven most abundant species in the study area can be discriminated: "Faidherbia albida"," Azadirachta indica", "Balanites aegyptiaca" and "Tamarindus indica". Next, random forest and support vector machine classifiers are employed to identify the optimal combination of classifier parameters to discriminate these classes with a high accuracy, robustness, and stability. The linear support vector machine with cost = 1 and gamma = 0.01 provides the optimal results with a global accuracy of 88 % and kappa of 0.71. This classifier is applied to the whole study area to map all the trees with crowns larger than 2 m, sorted in four identified species and a fifth common group of unidentified species. This map thus enables analysing the variability in tree density and the spatial distribution of different species. Such information can afterwards be correlated to the ecological functioning of the parkland and local practices, and offers promising opportunities to help future sustainability initiatives in different socio-ecological contexts.

J	Yue, QX; Zhan, XY; Guo, MH; Zhao, J; Liu, BY				Yue, Qiuxing; Zhan, Xiaoyun; Guo, Minghang; Zhao, Jun; Liu, Baoyuan			A Portable Device for On-Site Measurement of Sediment Concentration Through Volume-Mass Replacement	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												To enable on-site and near-real-time sediment concentration measurements, a novel type of portable device with a constant volume sampling bottle was developed in this study. The device consisted of a sampling bottle, a measuring assembly, and a platform for auxiliary data management. Five representative soils and eight sediment concentrations were used to validate the device accuracy and application. Moreover, a novel concept of sediment effective density (SED) was proposed. Under SED, a linear regression was fit between the measured and actual sediment concentrations. The results revealed that the slopes of the fitting line were close to 1, and the R-2 values were greater than 0.999 for five soils. Moreover, for total samples, the root mean square error (RMSE) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) values were 5.59 g/L and 0.9996, respectively. Additionally, an average SED of 2.51 g/cm(3) was calculated in this study. With an average soil SED of 2.51 g/cm(3) and an average soil solid density of 2.65 g/cm(3), the RMSE and NSE were 11.85 and 18.50 g/L and 0.9981 and 0.9954, respectively. This result demonstrated that the designed device accurately measured sediment concentration under various conditions. Furthermore, relative to the traditional oven-drying method, the device could measure sediment concentration near-real-time and with high accuracy, which could be useful for researchers with excellent potential. It was recommended to measure the SED in a laboratory or runoff plot because the sediment sources could be identified and obtained. In a field or river, it was recommended to use 2.51 g/cm(3) as the SED, which was more accurate than 2.65 g/cm(3).					yue, qiuxing/JQJ-0174-2023														0043-1397	1944-7973				APR	2023	59	4							e2022WR033584	10.1029/2022WR033584	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022WR033584													WOS:001000282600001

Influence of Simultaneous Intercropping of Maize-Bean with Input of Inorganic or Organic Fertilizer on Growth, Development, and Dry Matter Partitioning to Yield Components of Two Lines of Common Bean	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Intercropping is a common practice among smallholder farmers cultivating common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and maize (Zea mays L.). It affects agronomic performance, dry matter partitioning, and grain yield. Simultaneous intercropping of common bean with maize can influence growth, development, and dry matter partitioning of grain of common bean. The main objectives of this study are to: (i) evaluate the dynamics of growth and development of the different vegetative organs, and (ii) determine the efficiency in dry matter partitioning to yield components of two common bean lines grown under monoculture compared with two simultaneous intercropping patterns (pattern 1, pattern 2) with maize and managed with two types of fertilizer application. A randomized complete block design (RCBD) with 3 replications was used in a nested trifactorial arrangement in split-plot scheme. The field experiment was conducted in two seasons under conditions of acid soils and high temperatures in the western Amazon region of Colombia. Simultaneous intercropping patterns 1 and 2 had a negative effect on growth dynamics of maize compared to maize monoculture. But the two bean lines when associated with maize showed no significant differences on growth dynamics under both types of fertilizer application. Under both intercropping patterns, the maize cobs were larger, a condition that increased the number of grains, but with smaller size of grains compared to monoculture. In the case of two bean lines, the growth and development responses were different: under monoculture the number of pods and seeds per plant was higher while the number of grains per pod increased under intercropping patterns. Among the two bean lines, 100-seed weight was significantly higher in BFS 10 compared to ALB 121. At the grain yield level of common bean, the simultaneous intercropping pattern increased 516 kg ha(-1) and 993 kg ha(-1) more than that obtained in monoculture (4936 kg ha(-1)) with inorganic and organic fertilizer, respectively. Results from this study indicated that smallholders in the Amazon region of Colombia can achieve higher grain yield through the implementation of simultaneous intercropping of maize with common bean line (BFS 10) under organic fertilizer application.					suárez salazar, juan carlos/GXH-2202-2022; Rao, Idupulapati/HOH-5542-2023	Rao, Idupulapati/0000-0002-8381-9358; Vanegas Fonseca, Jose Ivan/0000-0001-9819-375X; Contreras Bastidas, Amara Tatiana/0000-0001-9319-5799; Anzola Torres, Jose Alexander/0000-0003-2040-3678; Suarez Salazar, Juan Carlos/0000-0001-5928-1837; Urban, Milan/0000-0002-3684-856X														2073-4395				MAY	2022	12	5							1216	10.3390/agronomy12051216	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12051216													WOS:000802554100001

Here, a saline-alkali tolerant algae was selected and applied to saline-alkali land to reveal its effects on land amendment and quinoa production. The results showed that Chlorella pyrenoidosa showed best growth and photosynthetic characteristics with increasing saline-alkali stress. Whether planting quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Longli No. 1) or not, the application of C. pyrenoidosa supplied soil available nutrients, held water retention, and notably the organic matter of saline-alkali land with quinoa cultivation after algal maximum dose (OD680 = 2.0) showed 64.7% more content than the control. Saline-alkali land caused 23.7% yield loss of quinoa, which was attributed to organic lack (3.093 g kg(-1)) and saline-alkali conditions (pH 9.49 and 119.3 mS m(-1) electrical conductivity). Algal addition improved the chlorophyll synthesis and effective quantum yield of quinoa, enhanced more absorbed light energy to involve in photosynthesis rather than heat dissipation, and promoted the synthesis of osmotic regulatory substances (soluble sugar and protein) and antioxidant (anthocyanin) to alleviated osmotic and oxidative stresses. The growth improvement of quinoa confirmed the greater effect of stress alleviation than growth stimulation that reflected 41.7% and 28.6% yield increases in saline-alkali and nonsaline-alkali lands. Overall, saline-alkali tolerant alga adjusted overground and underground parts, including amending soil properties as organic addition and nutrient supply, and strengthening the tolerance of quinoa to saline-alkali environment. This assessment supports a sustainable practice of applying stress tolerant alga for land amendment and halophytic crop production to develop saline-alkali land value.

Ziwuling, China	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Soil microorganisms play an important role in the functional connection between above- and below-ground ecosystems during vegetation restoration. However, the influencing patterns of plants and soils on the microbial properties in the process remain unclear, especially in ecologically fragile zones. Here, we investigated soil bacterial and fungal communities at twelve Pinus tabulaeformis stands on Ziwuling Mountain in Loess Hilly Region, along an age gradient from 15- to 45-year-old stands, with respect to abundance and diversity using Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and ITS gene, respectively. Soil microbial biomass, enzyme activity, vegetation characteristics (i.e., coverage, fine root biomass, and the composition and diversity) and soil properties (i.e., bulk density, organic C, total N, and available N) were also determined. The results showed that the microbial biomass increased significantly along the restoration chronosequence, being consistently the highest at the 45-y site. However, the saccharase, urease, catalase, and alkaline phosphatase that regulate soil organic matter and nutrient transformation were less impacted by the restoration time. Bacterial alpha diversity gradually increased with time whereas fungal alpha diversity was highest at the 30-y site, which was related to increasing levels of NO3-, coverage, and fine root biomass. The response of soil bacterial beta diversity to the age gradients was larger than that of fungal beta diversity, although both groups were significantly affected by vegetation restoration. Moreover, bacterial communities were dominated by oligotrophic Actinobacteria at 15-y and 25-y sites and transformed into copiotrophic Proteobacteria-dominant at 30-y and 45-y sites. However, no significant variation in the fungal dominant phyla (i.e., Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Zygomycota) were detected with restoration. Furthermore, the dominant species [Pinus tabulaeformis (tree) and Carex tristachya (herb)] affected the microbial biomass, diversity, and abundance of bacterial dominant phyla significantly, but affected the fungal community composition much less. Vegetation diversity has no significant effect on microbial diversities (alpha and beta diversity). Soil physicochemical factors could widely explain the variations in microbial diversity and community composition, enzyme activity, and microbial biomass in restoration processes, especially bulk density and NO3-. Overall, our results demonstrate that soil bacteria rather than fungi can reflect the changes in plant and soil properties with increasing stand age, and the shifts in the predominant bacterial and fungal characteristics along the age gradient were mainly the result of differences in soil physicochemical factors prevailing at each restoration stage.

J	Su, NH				Su, Ninghu			Random fractional partial differential equations and solutions for water movement in soils: Theory and applications	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												This paper analyses a set of random fractional partial differential equations (rfPDEs) for water movement in soils. The rfPDEs for both rigid and swelling soils are solved for both a random flux boundary condition (BC), and random concentration BC. Solutions from a random flux BC are presented for the large-time and small-time situations with the large-time solution as a very simple method for determining the flux through the surface of the soil. The equation of cumulative infiltration is presented with random parameters of the rfPDE subject to a random concentration BC. The simulations using the results of the rfPDE for the two types of BCs yielded encouraging and stable results based on two sets of field data: the first set of the data was measurements at a single site while the second set was from 26 measurements in a small catchment. The results suggest that the presented procedures are very useful methods for the interpolation, extrapolation, and prediction of hydrological variables and parameters such as water content, hydraulic conductivity or the flux through the surface of the soil. The methodologies presented in this paper are able to reveal and reproduce the realistic hydrological processes in nature which are often stochastic and random.																			0885-6087	1099-1085				MAR	2023	37	3							e14844	10.1002/hyp.14844	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14844													WOS:000953787300001

Pearl millet, however, is an under-utilized crop, despite its superior resilience to drought and heat stress in contrast to wheat. To investigate this in more detail, we performed comparative physiological screening and large scale proteomics of drought stress responses in drought-tolerant and susceptible genotypes of pearl millet and wheat. These chosen genotypes are widely used in breeding and farming practices. The physiological responses demonstrated large differences in the regulation of root morphology and photosynthetic machinery, revealing a stay-green phenotype in pearl millet. Subsequent tissue-specific proteome analysis of leaves, roots and seeds led to the identification of 12,558 proteins in pearl millet and wheat under well-watered and stress conditions. To allow for this comparative proteome analysis and to provide a platform for future functional proteomics studies we performed a systematic phylogenetic analysis of all orthologues in pearl millet, wheat, foxtail millet, sorghum, barley, brachypodium, rice, maize, Arabidopsis, and soybean. In summary, we define (i) a stay-green proteome signature in the drought-tolerant pearl millet phenotype and (ii) differential senescence proteome signatures in contrasting wheat phenotypes not capable of coping with similar drought stress. These different responses have a significant effect on yield and grain filling processes reflected by the harvest index. Proteome signatures related to root morphology and seed yield demonstrated the unexpected intra- and interspecies-specific biochemical plasticity for stress adaptation for both pearl millet and wheat genotypes. These quantitative reference data provide tissue- and phenotype-specific marker proteins of stress defense mechanisms which are not predictable from the genome sequence itself and have potential value for marker-assisted breeding beyond genome assisted breeding.
