However, our understanding of warming rates with elevation in complex mountain regions is incomplete. The most serious concern is the lack of high-quality near-surface air temperature (Tair) datasets in these areas. To address this knowledge gap, we developed an automated mapping framework for the estimation of seamless daily minimum and maximum Land Surface Temperatures (LSTs) for the Tibetan Plateau from the existing MODIS LST products for a long period of time (i.e., 2002-present). Specific machine learning methods were developed and linked with target-oriented validation and then applied to convert LST to Tair. Spatial variables in retrieving Tair, such as solar radiation and vegetation indices, were used in estimation of Tair, whereas MODIS LST products were mainly focused on temporal variation in surface air temperature. We validated our process using independent Tair products, revealing more reliable estimates on Tair; the R-2 and RMSE at monthly scales generally fell in the range of 0.9-0.95 and 1-2 degrees C. Using these continuous and consistent Tair datasets, we found temperature increases in the elevation range between 2000-3000 m and 4000-5000 m, whereas the elevation interval at 6000-7000 m exhibits a cooling trend. The developed datasets, findings and methodology contribute to global studies on accelerated warming.					zhang, mingxi/GYI-9562-2022; Cleverly, Jamie Rose/L-2134-2016; Yu, Qiang/D-3702-2009; Wang, Bin/AFI-6568-2022; yang, xihua/AAD-9855-2022; Huete, Alfredo/C-1294-2008	Cleverly, Jamie Rose/0000-0002-2731-7150; Yu, Qiang/0000-0001-6950-1821; Wang, Bin/0000-0002-6422-5802; zhang, Hong/0000-0001-9369-7481; Liu, De Li/0000-0003-2574-1908; Huete, Alfredo/0000-0003-2809-2376; Yang, Xihua/0000-0002-5990-2186														2072-4292				JUN	2020	12	11							1722	10.3390/rs12111722	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12111722													WOS:000543397000027

Here, we used widely-targeted metab-olomics technology to study the metabolic responses of three Chinese cabbage varieties with representative leaf colors after blue light treatment. The inner leaf color of orange varieties 20S530 and 15S1094 changed from yellow to golden yellow, while no visible color change occurred in the common variety 14S23 after the treat-ment. A total of 844 metabolites were measured from the leaf samples of these three varieties in a time course study after short term blue light treatment, with kaempferol-4 '-O-glucoside, isoquercitrin, hyperin, arbutin, sulforaphane as enriched nutritional metabolites. Orange Chinese cabbage varieties showed additional nutrition enhancement after the treatment. This study is the first to explore the global metabolic responses of Chinese cabbage after blue light treatment, and our findings provided valuable insights on how to effectively use lighting conditions to enhance specific groups of nutrients in vegetables.

However, little is known regarding the effect of cover crop species, biomass quality and quantity, and method of residue placement on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Using meta-analysis, this study examined the effect of cover crop species, quality and quantity of biomass, and residue management on response ratios (RRs) of cover crops to no cover crop on CO2 and N2O emissions following cash crops. All cover crop species increased CO2 emissions, but reduced N2O emissions compared with no cover crop, except legumes which increased N2O emissions. Cover crop biomass explained 63% of variability in increased CO2 emissions and 55% of variability in decreased N2O emissions. Both CO2 and N2O emissions decreased polynomially with increased cover crop biomass C/N ratio, with greater rate of decline for legumes than nonlegumes. Cover crop residue incorporated into the soil increased CO2 and N2O emissions compared with the residue placed at surface or removed from the soil. Cover crops emitted lower CO2 and N2O emissions than no cover crops in silty loam and sandy clay loam soils, respectively, compared to clay loam and silty clay loam soils. Both soil organic carbon and total nitrogen increased with cover crop compared to no cover crop. Although CO2 and N2O emissions varied with cover crop species, using legume and nonlegume cover crop mixture to enhance residue C/N ratio compared to legumes and placing the residue at the surface instead of incorporating into the soil can reduce GHG emissions. Because of enhanced soil C and N storage and other known benefits, improvement in soil health and environmental quality due to cover crop may outweigh CO2 emissions compared to no cover crop.

Small-tailed Han sheep were introduced to the plateau and are raised mainly in feed-lots. Based on their different backgrounds, we hypothesized that the ability to cope with poor diets would be better in Tibetan than in Han sheep. To test our prediction, we examined the effect of dietary energy on apparent digestibilities, rumen fermentation, urinary purine derivatives and serum metabolites by using a 4 x 4 Latin square design in each sheep breed. Four diets were formulated to be low in crude protein (similar to 7%) but to differ in metabolizable energy concentration. Average daily gain was greater in Tibetan than in Han sheep (p < 0.01) and increased linearly with an increase in energy intake (p < 0.001). The digestibilities of dry matter, organic matter, gross energy, and neutral and acid detergent fibres were greater in Tibetan than in Han sheep (p < 0.05). Ruminal pH was lower ( p < 0.05), while volatile fatty acids ( VFAs), urea-N, ammonia-N and soluble protein-N concentrations were higher ( p < 0.05) in Tibetan than in Han sheep. As a molar proportion of total VFA, acetate decreased (p < 0.001) with an increase in dietary energy whereas propionate and butyrate increased (p < 0.05). Urinary purine derivative excretion was greater in Tibetan than in Han sheep (p < 0.01), as was microbial nitrogen production; both parameters increased with dietary energy ( p < 0.01). Serum concentrations of glucose, insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 increased ( p < 0.05) as energy level increased, while non-esterified fatty acids and growth hormone decreased (p < 0.05). It was concluded that Tibetan sheep were better able to cope with low-protein, low-energy diets and, consequently, our prediction was supported.

Here, we combined an isotopic approach with meta-genomic sequencing to investigate priming effects at five forest sites along an elevational gradient. Positive priming effects were found across the Quercus aliena var. acutiserrata (low elevation), Q. wutaishanica (low-mid elevation), Betula albosinensis (mid elevation), Abies fargesii Franch (mid-high elevation), and Larbc chinensis Beissn (high elevation) forest sites. A significant positive correlation was found between the abundance of microbial C decomposition genes and priming effects (p < 0.05). Further analysis revealed that the microbial functional genes for breaking down stable C (lignin, lipids, and chitin) predominately drove the positive priming effects. Moreover, we found strong correlations between the relative abundance of eight near-complete bacterial genome bins and the priming effect. Five out of the eight genomes were associated with the Proteobacteria, indicating their predominant role in priming effects. Our results revealed that SOM quality (soil organic C, total nitrogen, and ratio of alkyl-C to O-alkyl-C), and soil environment (pH and bulk density) were the major drivers of the priming effect in forest soils as they regulated the abundance of microbial decomposition genes. In conclusion, the present study investigated the metagenomic basis of the priming effect, highlighting the importance of bacteria in association with substrate and environmental factors for C decomposition in forest soils.

Although there have studies of maize residue decomposition, seldom focused on combining different parts of maize residue under field and incubation experiments at different temperatures in saline and alkaline soils. We carried out an incubated decomposition experiment of maize residue (15, 25, 35 degrees C) and a field experiment (12 similar to 29 degrees C) by litter bag method within 90 days in a Solonchak. A double exponential model was used to simulate labile C (carbon) and recalcitrant C in decomposition. The correlation showed a closed decomposition relationship (R-2 > 0.98) for double exponential model. Field and laboratory experiments showed decomposition increased with temperature and followed order leaf (35%similar to 73%) > stem (35%similar to 72%) > root (21%similar to 63%). The decomposition increased rapidly within first 15 days and then slowed. The decomposition rates (day(-1)) of maize residue were 0.10 similar to 0.16 (labile C) and 0.0005 similar to 0.0015 (recalcitrant C) at field, and 0.05 similar to 0.10 and 0.0001 similar to 0.0014 at lab. The decomposition rate (day(-1)) of native soil organic C (SOC) labile C (0.05 similar to 0.13) and recalcitrant C (0.0002 similar to 0.0005) changed with temperature, but recalcitrant C changed not (0.98). The decomposition rate of recalcitrant C increased by 180%similar to 1100%, which was higher than that of labile C (50%similar to 80%) with increasing temperature. The Q(10) value showed decomposition of maize residue and SOC at 15 similar to 25 degrees C was larger than that at 25 similar to 35 degrees C. By adding 1 g maize stem or leaf to field, 0.15 similar to 0.39 g or 0.18 similar to 0.33 g C stored in soil, respectively. In summary, increased temperature significantly accelerated maize residue decomposition by increasing decomposition rate and turning a part of recalcitrant C into labile C. The temperature sensitivity of maize residue and SOC decomposition was higher at 15 similar to 25 degrees C than at 25 similar to 35 degrees C. The simulated saline and alkaline soil C stock was 0.1 similar to 1.7 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) from maize stem and leaf return facing warming.

Psychological surveys have been done over ten years, including the Baum test, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (COPE), Subjective Health Complaints Inventory (SHC), the Two-Sided Personality Scale (TSPS) and medical consultations in Syowa Station, a Japanese Antarctic station to reveal the mental status of team members. Team members experienced fewer physical health risks in Antarctica than in Japan. Wintering-over team members reinterpreted situations positively and accepted their environment, sought instrumental social support, planned ahead, and used active coping skills and humour to overcome difficulties. They did not act out emotionally or deny problems. Individuals exhibited two types of coping, either stability through maintaining a previous lifestyle or flexible adjustment to a new way of life. Positive affect remained constant during the wintering-over period. In living through a harsh reality, team members drew support from the subjective feelings of an "internal relationship" with home or family in their minds. Thus, an Antarctic wintering-over station is an ideal isolated environment for psychological surveys, which can help understand future space travel and group managements in everyday societies.

Investigating hydrometeorology of the Western Himalayas: Insights from stable isotopes of water and meteorological parameters	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												The Himalayas govern the hydrometeorology of the entire Indian subcontinent and feed 19 major rivers on which a large population is dependent. Despite its vast socio-economic relevance, there exist knowledge gaps in the detailed understanding of Himalayan hydrometeorology. The present study attempts to understand subtle hy-drometeorological processes concerning precipitation in Western Himalaya (WH), which is further complex due to several mountain ranges in addition to the Great Himalaya and varied land cover. In this backdrop, oxygen and hydrogen isotopic analyses of daily precipitation samples collected from Jammu was done. Major processes and features identified are: (1) Raindrop re-evaporation is dominant, indicated by lower delta O-18 - delta D regression slope (6.6 & PLUSMN; 0.2). (2) Maximum raindrop re-evaporation occurs during Western Disturbances (WD), evident from the low d-excess (< 10%o) and high delta O-18 (> 0%o) with low rainfall. (3) Contrary to expectations, negligible moisture is derived from the Mediterranean region (MR) through WD. In contrast, maximum moisture (-97%) is derived from local terrestrial sources, estimated through backward wind trajectories and confirmed by vertical wind velocity (omega) and OLR. (4) The Arabian Sea (AS) moisture contributes more (-11%) compared to the Bay of Bengal (BOB) moisture (-8%) during the monsoon. (5) Isotopically, the most depleted precipitation during July-Aug is associated with continental recycling from the Indo-Gangetic plains and not with the BOB moisture. (6) Isotopic enrichment in precipitation towards end of monsoon is attributed to raindrop re-evaporation, lesser rainout fraction and moisture derived from enriched local sources. (7) Annually, 87% of the moisture for pre-cipitation is derived through continental recycling, and only 13% of the moisture is derived through marine sources (11% from AS and 2% from BOB). Moisture from MR (< 0.1%) is negligible.

M.; Li, Feng-Min			Film Mulching with Low Phosphorus Application Improves Soil Organic Carbon and Its Decomposability in a Semiarid Agroecosystem	AGRICULTURE-BASEL												Soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and decomposability are crucial for soil quality. Film mulching and phosphorus (P) application are important agricultural practices on the semiarid Loess Plateau. This study analyzed the combined effects of film mulching and P application on SOC, its fractions, and mineralization kinetics under alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). The six-year field experiment incorporated randomized blocks of split-plot design with two mulching treatments (no film mulching with flat planting and film mulching with ridges and furrows) as main plots and four P levels (P0: 0 kg ha(-1), P1: 9.73 kg ha(-1), P2: 19.3 kg ha(-1), P3: 28.9 kg ha(-1)) as subplots. Mulching increased SOC content, SOC fractions (light and heavy fraction organic C, microbial biomass C, and dissolved organic C), and mineralization. After six years, mulching increased SOC content by 2.18, 2.60, 2.37, and 0.17 g kg(-1) at P0, P1, P2, and P3, relative to no mulching. With increasing P levels, SOC fractions and mineralization increased under no mulching but increased initially and then decreased under mulching. P1 with mulching displayed the highest SOC utilization efficiency and stability. Kinetic models divided SOC into an active and a slow SOC pool, with the latter showing the lowest decomposability and highest stability in P1 with mulching. Overall, film mulching with a low P level, especially 11.9 kg ha(-1) P fertilizer, promoted SOC storage under alfalfa on the semiarid Loess Plateau due to the high SOC content with high C utilization efficiency and stability and low decomposability.

However, the potato yield is low and highly variable due to limited water and nutrient availabilities in the region. Irrigation and nitrogen (N) fertilization have been used widely to enhance potato yield but result in negative environmental impacts in the APE. This study aims to explore the optimum combinations of irrigation and N fertilization for different potato production goals by using APSIM-Potato model calibrated well by field experiments with different combinations of irrigation and N fertilizer conducted at the typical site in the APE. Long-term (1981-2010) simulation for potato yield, water use efficiency (WUE), nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), economic profits and environmental impacts were analyzed under different combinations of irrigation (IR, based on the soil water deficit, ranged from 10 (IR10) to 100 mm (IR100) with the interval of 10 mm) and N fertilization (ranged from 0 (N0) to 210 (N210) kg ha-1 with the interval of 30 kg ha-1). Combination of IR10 and N210 maximized potato yields in the whole APE, and the yield was highest in the middle APE, with the value of 35.2 t ha-1, which was 6.7% and 2.1% higher than that in the eastern and western APE. However, such water and nitrogen managements would cause annual decline of groundwater table by 1.6 m and N loss by 10.9 kg ha-1. In order to achieve the highest WUE, the irrigation amounts should be 124, 107 and 132 mm in the eastern, middle and western APE, respectively, coupled with 90 kg ha-1 N fertilizer, and the highest WUEs were 89.6 kg ha-1 mm-1, 93.1 kg ha-1 mm-1 and 84.8 kg ha-1 mm-1 in the eastern, middle and western APE. For highest FNUE, the combination should be IR10 and N30 across APE, and the highest values were 959 kg ha-1 kg-1, 1092 kg ha-1 kg-1 and 1022 kg ha-1 kg-1 in the eastern, middle and western APE. Moreover, to get the highest income, the irrigation ranged from IR50 to IR10 and the amounts of N fertilizers ranged from 30 kg ha-1 to 120 kg ha-1, and the maximum incomes were 18,250 CNY ha-1, 20,060 CNY ha-1 and 19,660 CNY ha-1 in the eastern, middle and western APE. In all, the combination that maximized the income could contain the relative higher yield, WUE, NUE and lower environmental sequence. Our study would be helpful in determining the optimal amounts of irrigation and N fertilization for different goals of potato production in the APE.

The so-called "Marab" WHT was initially developed by Middle Eastern agro-pastoralists that reside or commute in semi-arid and arid rangelands. The Marab WHT is a macro-catchment measure consisting of earth dams and stone spillways along the contours of a lowland depression or floodplain. Dependent on the local context (i.e., climate, soil, management, etc.), the established Marabs show highly variable effectiveness and little scientific evidence is supporting the scaling out of the technology. This study aims at filling the knowledge gap on the Marab performance in different environments by simulating its hydro-agrological effects for different soils and climatic conditions using the AquaCrop model. A case study performed for a Jordanian Marab over three seasons (2019-2022) confirms its huge improvement potential for barley production. Through Marab-based farming, barley production reached 8.37 t ha(-1) on average, versus highly variable 0.34 t ha(-1) without the WHT. The simulation-based assessment of soil textures identified that silty soils have the largest potential for producing up to 9.25 t ha(-1) barley, compared to 6.60 t ha(-1) produced in clay soils. Assessing different climate scenarios, a slight increase in daily average temperatures (+0.5 & DEG;C) led to a considerable production decline of 4%-8%, while a significant reduction of precipitation (-20%) decreased biomass production by a similar rate (4%-10%). This underlines the robustness of the "Marab" WHT to rainfall amount variation. However, simulations also highlight the sensitivity of timing and frequency of flood events: removing the last and the first flood event reduced biomass production by approximately 50% and 80%, respectively, while the barley fails to develop if both events were suppressed.					; Castelli, Giulio/O-2592-2018	Haddad, Mira/0000-0002-9450-1599; Villani, Lorenzo/0000-0002-4241-7619; Hilali, Muhi El-Dine/0000-0002-8945-9613; Castelli, Giulio/0000-0002-0209-0869													1085-3278	1099-145X				NOV	2023	34	17					5191	5206		10.1002/ldr.4838	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4838		JUL 2023											WOS:001036358400001

Here, we investigated the changes of microbial residues along soil profiles (0-100 cm) from 44 typical ecosystems with a wide range of climates (similar to 3100 km transects across China). Our results showed that microbial residues account for a larger portion of soil carbon in deeper (60-100 cm) vs. shallower (0-30 and 30-60 cm) soils. Moreover, we find that climate especially challenges the accumulation of microbial residues in deep soils, while soil properties and climate share their roles in controlling the residue accumulation in surface soils. Climatic seasonality, including positive correlations with summer precipitation and maximum monthly precipitation, as well as negative correlations with temperature annual range, are important factors explaining microbial residue accumulation in deep soils across China. In particular, summer precipitation is the key regulator of microbial-driven carbon stability in deep soils, which has 37.2% of relative independent effects on deep-soil microbial residue accumulation. Our work provides novel insights into the importance of climatic seasonality in driving the stabilization of microbial residues in deep soils, challenging the idea that deep soils as long-term carbon reservoirs can buffer climate change.

Yaks are raised by vertical transhumance, grazing at higher altitudes in summer and lower altitudes in winter. It is mainly in winter, when forage is of poor quality, that the two species co-graze. At this time, yaks do not receive supplements or shelter while cattle require supplements and night shelter. Previous studies reported that both energy and protein utilization were greater in yaks than cattle, and the rumen microbiota differed between the species. Based on the differences between species, we hypothesized that the rumen microbiota would enable yaks to digest a poor quality diet to a greater extent than cattle. This could explain why yaks are able to overcome the harsh winter without supplements while grazing poor quality pasture, but cattle require supplements. To test the hypothesis, fermentation parameters were studied in vitro using rumen inocula from yaks and cattle. Four isonitrogenous substrates of different energy levels (6.62, 8.02, 9.42, 10.80 MJ ME/kg) were used. The neutral and acid fiber detergent digestibilities were greater (P < 0.05) in yaks than in cattle and both increased linearly (P < 0.05) with increasing energy level. Methane production was lesser (P < 0.05) in yaks than cattle, and decreased linearly (P < 0.05) with increasing energy level. Concentrations of total volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and acetate, the ratio of acetate to propionate, and ammonia-N (except at 48 h) were greater (P < 0.05) in yaks than cattle; whereas concentrations of propionate (except at 6 h), butyrate, and iso-VFAs were lesser (P < 0.05) in yaks than cattle. In addition, total VFAs, propionate, butyrate, and ammonia-N increased linearly (P < 0.05), whereas, acetate and the ratio of acetate to propionate decreased linearly (P < 0.05) with increasing energy level. The relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was greater (P < 0.05), whereas of Firmicutes and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes were lesser (P < 0.01) in yaks than cattle, and Bacteroidetes decreased linearly (P < 0.001), whereas Firmicutes and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes increased linearly (P < 0.01) with increasing energy levels. The relative abundances of fibrolytic bacteria (e.g. Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group and Butyrivibrio) and of H-2-incorporating bacteria (e.g. Quinella) were greater (P < 0.05), whereas, amylolytic bacteria (e.g. Selenomonas and Succiniclasticum) and of H-2-producing bacteria (e.g. Lachnospiraceae_NK3A20_group and Ruminococcus) were lesser (P < 0.05) in the rumen inoculum from yaks than cattle. It was concluded that the greater relative abundance of fibrolytic and H-2-incorporation bacteria and lesser H-2-producing bacteria enable yaks to better digest fibers and produce less CH4 than cattle.

Soil enzyme kinetic parameters (Vmax and Km) can be used to reflect the maximum reaction rates and affinities of soil enzymes. However, how N and P fertilizers affect the temperature sensitivity of soil enzyme kinetics is poorly understood. Therefore, our study investigated the response of soil enzyme kinetic temperature sensitivity relevant to C, N, and P cycles based on a 9 year fertilization (N and P) experiment performed in an alpine grassland on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in China. Our results showed the following: N and P addition positively affected the Km of beta-glucosidase (BG); P and NP interaction significantly increased the Km of phosphatase (AP), indicating that N and P addition significantly negatively affected the substrate affinity of soil enzymes. The temperature sensitivity of Michaelis-Menten kinetics was different for different enzymes. N and P fertilization decreased the temperature sensitivity of Km of BG but increased the temperature sensitivity of the Km of N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG) and AP. In our study, P and NP fertilization increased the temperature sensitivity and activation energy of the Vmax of BG, indicating that P elements promoted the secretion of more extracellular enzymes by soil microbes to cope with temperature changes. The enzymes involved in the soil N and P cycle responded to the exogenous N and P through increases and decreases in the temperature sensitivity of the Km and Vmax, respectively. This study is crucial for investigating the impact of nutrient input on soil ecosystem functions under future climate warming conditions.

Benefits and limitations of straw mulching and incorporation on maize yield, water use efficiency, and nitrogen use efficiency	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Straw mulching and straw incorporation are widely used for conservation tillage as the primary methods of returning straw to the field. However, few studies have investigated the effects of straw mulching and straw incorporation under various agronomic management and environmental and edaphic factors. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis incorporating 112 publications to determine whether straw incorporation and straw mulching had different effects on maize yield, water use efficiency (WUE), and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) under contrasting soil textures, N application rates, straw returning amounts, and annual average precipitation, temperature, and evaporation. The results showed that straw mulching and straw incorporation significantly increase maize yields, WUE, and NUE. Straw mulching yield had a significant positive correlation with WUE, while straw incorporation yield had significant positive correlations with WUE and NUE. Maize yield and WUE increased and NUE decreased with increasing nitrogen application rate. Straw incorporation increased maize yield and NUE more than straw mulching at low straw returning amounts (< 6000 kg ha-1). In arid and semi-arid areas with 400 mm average annual precipitation and 7 <degrees>C, while straw incorporation is more conducive to increasing maize yield, WUE, and NUE with average annual temperatures 13 degrees C. Of the three soil textures, the largest weighted response ratio of straw returning on yield and NUE occurred in loam soil with straw incorporation. This study identified the benefits and limitations of straw incorporation and straw mulching on maize yield, NUE, and WUE.

Agronomic managements, such as irrigation, fertilization and intensive cropping systems, has been used for increasing potato yield but resulted in negative environmental sequences (e.g., soil dryness and groundwater table decline) in such arid and semi-arid regions. This study aims to quantify the agronomic options for better potato production and groundwater conservations based on field experiments together with APSIM-Potato model. The long-term simulated crop yield, economic income and environmental impact (surface soil water content and groundwater table) were analyzed for the different cropping systems of potato (continuous planting, CP; alternating planting and fallowing, APF; long-term continuous fallowing, LF) and irrigation scheduling (rainfed and one-four irrigations). The calibrated APSIM-Potato performed well in simulating the responses of soil water dynamics, leaf area index (LAI), biomass, evapotranspiration (ET) and yield of potato to different irrigation treatments. Long-term (1981-2010) simulated potato yield could be increased by 43.4-90.2% from rainfed yield if irrigation was applied from 60 to 240 mm and the yield gap between the potential and rainfed yields could be narrowed by 41.5-85.9%. Across the APE, CP with four irrigations (240 mm) produced the maximum income of 18,445 Yuan.ha(-1) while WUE was the highest for both CP and APF with two irrigations (120 mm). However, such irrigation amounts would decrease the groundwater table by 4.1-42 m across the APE during this period. Rainfed CP could enhance the groundwater table by 0-3 m but decrease available soil water content in 1 m depth by 15.5 mm per decade from 1981 to 2010. Rainfed APF and LF increase available soil water content in 1 m depth by 2-79 mm and 100-143 mm respectively. The study suggested that CP would decrease the soil moisture significantly and increase the risk of soil desertification in the APE. APF with one irrigation by harvesting rainwater could be a feasible way of maintaining soil moisture and groundwater conservation if government subsidy could guarantee the incomes of local farmers in the APE in North China.

Field measurements on 483 species at 48 sites across China were used to analyse variation in leaf traits, and assess their predictability. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to characterize trait variation, redundancy analysis (RDA) to reveal climate effects, and RDA with variance partitioning to estimate separate and overlapping effects of site, climate, life-form and family membership. Four orthogonal dimensions of total trait variation were identified: leaf area (LA), internal-to-ambient CO2 ratio (chi), leaf economics spectrum traits (specific leaf area (SLA) versus leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and nitrogen per area (N-area)), and photosynthetic capacities (V-cmax, J(max) at 25 degrees C). LA and chi covaried with moisture index. Site, climate, life form and family together explained 70% of trait variance. Families accounted for 17%, and climate and families together 29%. LDMC and SLA showed the largest family effects. Independent life-form effects were small. Climate influences trait variation in part by selection for different life forms and families. Trait values derived from climate data via RDA showed substantial predictive power for trait values in the available global data sets. Systematic trait data collection across all climates and biomes is still necessary.

However, Manning's coefficient of SF cannot be estimated accurately due to the strong influences of rainfall, slope gradient, ground surface roughness, sediment size, etc. The effects of rainfall, especially rain-storms, on Manning's n are usually ignored. In this study, flume tests were conducted with rainfall intensities ranging from 40 to 120 mm h-1, unit width inflow discharges ranging from 0.02 to 0.06 m2 min-1, bed surface roughness values ranging from 0.009 to 0.25 mm, and slope gradients ranging from 3 degrees to 7 degrees. Manning's n and the correction (Delta nr) induced by raindrops were calculated. The results indicated that Manning's n without rainfall increased with increasing surface roughness and decreasing unit width inflow discharge. In rainstorms, Man-ning's n increased with increasing rainfall intensity and surface roughness and decreasing unit width inflow discharge. Delta nr increased with increasing rainfall intensity and surface roughness and decreased slightly with increasing unit width inflow discharge. Manning's n significantly decreased with increasing Froude number (Fr) according to a power function, while Delta nr significantly decreased logarithmically with increasing Fr. The Delta nr values of this study were greater than 0 when Fr was less than approximately 2.15. For slope gradients of 3 degrees, 5 degrees and 7 degrees, the rainfall increased n by 1.47-49.33 %, 0.44-21.81 % and 0.43-23.94 % for the cases of Fr < 2.15, respectively. This result indicates that the effects of rainfall on Manning's n of SF cannot be ignored for laminar flows and low Reynolds numbers (<900). Additionally, two empirical equations for predicting Manning's n and Delta nr under rainfall conditions were devised. The correction Delta nr due to raindrop impact was affected by the inflow or base flow regimes. This study experimentally provides basic insights into the effects of rainfall on Manning's coefficient.

Here, a set of six subcatchments ranging in size from 0.7 hm(2) to 10,000 hm(2) were evaluated over the 2011-2015 period. (i) The annual average runoff coefficient differed with different subcatchments due to the spatial heterogeneity of landscape patterns, while the event-based runoff coefficient under the same catchment showed a decreasing trend with increasing rainfall intensity. (ii) The annual average and event-based runoff coefficients initially increased and then decreased with an increase in the area ratio of aquaculture ponds and reservoirs. The critical area ratio of aquaculture ponds and reservoirs for the maximum runoff coefficient in annual, light, and moderate rainfall intensity was about 4%; but this value would be transferred forward to the position of < 4% under the intensity of heavy rain, rainstorms, and heavy rainstorms. (iii) All runoff coefficients decreased with increasing forestland but increased with increasing paddy fields, and the decreasing rate was greater than the increasing rate. The trends of runoff coefficient for the annual and event-based rainfall are opposite between river development coefficient and watershed shape coefficient. The results provide underlying insights for decision-makers in aquaculture land-use planning and the sustainable utilization of water resources in the upstream and downstream systems of a catchment.

Based on the data of five hydrological stations from 1957 to 2018, this study investigated the variation of annual runoff both in the whole Weihe River basin (WWRB) and its sub-regions: the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Weihe River (URWR, MRWR, LRWR, respectively), the Jing River basin (JRB), and the Beiluo River basin (BLRB). Moreover, the contribution of climate change and anthropogenic activities on runoff change was quantified by double mass curve (DMC) and hydrological sensitivity analysis (HSA) methods. The results showed that runoff of the URWR, MRWR, JRB, BLRB, and WWRB showed significant downward trends, and with the change-point years of 1993, 1990, 1996, 1994, and 1993, respectively. Both results of DMC and HSA showed that anthropogenic activities were the main factors for runoff reduction. The contribution of human activities was largest in the JRB and BLRB, whereas lowest in the MRWR. Over the study period, land use has changed significantly in the basin, mainly manifested in the reduction of farmland, and the increase of construction land and grassland, indicating that intense anthropogenic activities have taken place. Moreover, the total water consumption of the WWRB increased evidently, which exacerbated the contradiction between supply and demand of water resources. The results of HSA showed that runoff was more sensitive to precipitation than to E-p. Precipitation reduced the runoff, while E-p increased runoff in the basin. The results of this study are helpful for understanding the regional hydrological situation in more detail, and can act as a reference for formulating reasonable water resources allocation schemes.

However, researches on their distribution and fates in farmland as well as their potential impacts on soil ecosystems are limited, especially studies on the influences of MPs on enzymes associated with carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycling and microbial nutrient limitations characterized by enzymatic stoichiometry are missing. In this study, we investigated the MPs characteristics under different continuous mulching management years (3, 6, 10, 15, and 20a) of tobacco fields in Enshi Prefecture, China, and identified the mechanisms of MPs pollution on soil microbial nutrient limitations. The results showed that the abundance of MPs varied from 647 to 2840 items/kg. Films, fibers and smallsized particles (0-1.0 mm) were the predominant types and size, respectively, and increased significantly with the increase of planting years. A vector analysis of enzyme activity suggested that microbial metabolism was limited both with C and P. The correlation analysis demonstrated that MPs pollution and soil properties were significantly linked to microbial nutrient limitations. Meanwhile, partial least squares path model (PLS-PM) revealed that MPs abundance exacerbated microbial limitation mainly by directly affecting soil microbial properties, followed by soil physical properties and soil nutrients, whereas MPs size and shapes indirectly exacerbated microbial nutrient limitation by significantly influencing MPs abundance. These results demonstrated that contamination of soil with MPs may have deleterious effects on soil key functions related to microbial metabolism, nutrient cycling, etc. Changes in soil properties and functions can damage plant growth and development, which may further affect crop yield and quality. This study provided a new theoretical basis for the response of soil microbial metabolism to MPs pollution and facilitated a better understanding and estimation of the environmental behavior and ecological risk of MPs in agricultural fields.(c) 2021 International Association for Gondwana Research.

Studies demonstrate that the gut microbiota and their metabolites are involved in host energy homeostasis, but little is known on the interactions among salt loading, gut microbiota, and osmoregulation. The aim of this study was to fill this gap. Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) were offered drinking water (Con) and either water containing moderate (4%, MS) or high NaCl (8%, HS) ad libitum. Intake of HS reduced alpha diversity of the microbial community and, at the genus level, reduced the relative abundances of Rikenella and Christensenella but increased Atopobium. To confirm the function of gut microbiota in host osmoregulation, we transplanted caecal microbiota in HS gerbils. To cope with salt loading, the gerbils concentrated urine, resulting in negative energy balance and systemic inflammation. The HS gerbils increased hypothalamic arginine vasopressin and intestinal and renal aquaporin 2 to support water retention, and reduced intestinal and renal epithelial sodium channel alpha to promote sodium excretion. However, HS gerbils with caecal microbiota transplant (CMT) from Con donors maintained energy balance and osmoregulation, and had a much reduced systemic inflammation. Further, CMT from Con donors to HS recipients reshaped the gut microbiota, particularly by reducing Parabacteroides distasonis and Prevotella copri, and increasing Lactobacillus reuteri abundances, with a resulting increase in bacterial metabolites such as butyrate. These findings highlight a vital role of the microbiota-gut-kidney axis in mediating salt-related osmoregulation, allowing small mammals to adapt to high salt loads in a desert habitat.

However, the responses of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in soils and soil fractions to erosion remain largely unclear, hindering the precise prediction of the fate of C and N in the terrestrial ecosystem. Herein, we compared the mineralization of organic carbon (OC) and N at two different temperatures (15 and 25 degrees C) in bulk soils and aggregate fractions of 19 soils before and after a simulated rainstorm. The temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of OC and N mineralization was calculated. Soil samples were collected from 9 sites across China, with soil types of Alfisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, Ultisols, and land uses of croplands, grasslands, and woodlands. The soil aggregate fractions were >2, 2-1, 1-0.25 and <0.25 mm, respectively. We hypothesized that erosion will decrease OC and N mineralization due to the loss of labile organic matter from soils and that the effects of erosion would decrease with clay content and vary with different aggregate fractions. In support of these hypotheses, the cumulative mineralized OC and N (C-m and N-m) in the soils and aggregate fractions were decreased of 78-85% and 37-52% after erosion, and the temperature sensitivities of OC and N mineralization were decreased of 80-84% and 4-43%, respectively. The effects of erosion varied with site where the soil was collected. The decreases in C-m and N-m mainly occurred in small aggregate sizes (1-0.25 and <0.25 mm fractions). The C-m and N-m in bulk soils and aggregates increased significantly with the contents of OC, N, labile OC and mineral N but were texture independent. These results highlighted significantly reduction of OC and N mineralization at eroding sites, which should be carefully considered when assessing emissions of greenhouse gases in eroding environments.

This is a particularly pressing problem for Ethiopia owing to centuries-old unsustainable agricultural practices. This study aimed to evaluate the inoculum potential of soils from church forest in the northwest highlands of Ethiopia and its effect on seedling growth of two selected native tree species (Olea europaeaandAlbizia gummifera) under a glasshouse environment. Seedlings germinated in a seed chamber were transplanted into pots containing sterilized and/or non-sterilized soils collected from under the canopy of three dominant church forest trees:Albizia gummifera(AG),Croton macrostachyus(CM), andJuniperus procera(JP) as well as from adjacent degraded land (DL). A total of 128 pots (2 plant species x 4 soil origins x 2 soil treatments x 8 replicates) were arranged in a factorial design. Overall, seedlings grown in AG, CM, and JP soils showed a higher plant performance and survival rate, as a result of higher soil microbial abundance and diversity, than those grown in DL soils. The results showed significantly higher plant height, root collar diameter, shoot, and total mass for seedlings grown in non-sterilized forest soils than those grown in sterilized soils. Furthermore, the bacterial relative abundance ofAcidobacteria,Actinobacteria, andNitrospiraewas significantly higher in the non-sterilized forest soils AG, CM, and JP (r(2)= 0.6-0.8,p< 0.001). Soil pH had a strong effect on abundance of the bacterial community in the church forest soils. More specifically, this study further demonstrated that the effect of soil microbiome was noticeable on the performance ofOleaseedlings grown in the soil from CM. This suggests that the soils from remnant church forests, particularly from the canopy under CM, can serve as a good soil origin, which possibly would promote the native tree seedling growth and survival in degraded lands.					taniguchi, takeshi/AAG-5450-2021; Haregeweyn, Nigussie/J-5616-2015; Ebabu, Kindiye/AAH-7884-2019; Getu Abebe, Messalea/GRS-3974-2022; Taniguchi, Takeshi/C-9364-2019; Mamedov, Amrakh I./S-3748-2016; Tsunekawa, Atsushi/L-8526-2013; Tsubo, Mitsuru/C-4027-2016	taniguchi, takeshi/0000-0001-7386-1117; Haregeweyn, Nigussie/0000-0003-2920-8094; Ebabu, Kindiye/0000-0002-1381-149X; Mamedov, Amrakh I./0000-0002-0569-983X; Tsunekawa, Atsushi/0000-0002-7690-0633; Tsubo, Mitsuru/0000-0002-8729-2215; Adgo, Enyew/0000-0001-6824-5037														2071-1050				JUN	2020	12	12							4976	10.3390/su12124976	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12124976													WOS:000550310000001

Living trees in upland forests might contribute to the global CH4 emissions but the contribution is poorly understood and the mechanisms of CH4 production in their heartwood are not completely clear. Using gene sequencing and a series of laboratory incubations, this study addressed whether CH4 produced in the heartwood of living trees in upland forests is microbial in origin and how the CH4 production is affected by secondary metabolites. Both the response of CH4 production to temperatures and the presence of methanogenic archaea indicate that the CH4 produced in heartwood was microbial in origin. Methanobacterium was the dominant methanogens in the heartwood of Populus canadensis which had high concentrations of CH4, and was absent from the heartwood of Pinus tabuliformis and Salix matsudana which produced negligible or very low CH4. Water- and ethanol-soluble extractives enhanced microbial CH4 production in heartwood incubations but acetone-soluble extractives inhibited the production. Since acetone-soluble extractives inhibited the production of microbial CH4, it is assumed that the CH4 production may be suppressed from heartwood with phenolic compounds that act as an antibiotic for methanogenic archaea in most living trees in upland forests. The inhibitory effects of secondary metabolites on microbial CH4 production in heartwood reduce the CH4 emissions from the stems of living trees in upland forests.

Here we upscaled site-level NEE from 44 grassland flux towers (1,457 site-months) to the global scale by using a model tree ensemble approach that considers the management activities (grazing and cutting) (MTE-GM). Cross-validation showed that MTE-GM performs reasonably well in terms of among-site variability and seasonal variation, with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.90 and 0.86 and an R-2 of 0.91 and 0.86, respectively. Radiation (shortwave and longwave), temperature, leaf area index, and fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation had the highest relative explanatory power in predicting NEE. Based on MTE-GM, mean annual NEE of global grassland was 72 +/- 4 g C m(-2) year(-1) (1.9 +/- 0.11 Pg C year(-1)) during 1982-2011, suggesting that the grassland ecosystems have been acting as a small carbon source during the past three decades. However, grasslands in temperate and continental regions had the largest carbon sink of -61.9 +/- 5.7 and -51.8 +/- 7.9 g C m(-2) year(-1), respectively. Moreover, we found that elimination of grassland management effect resulted in an extra emission of 1.7% CO2 to the atmosphere (CO2 sink from the management is 0.03 Pg C year(-1)). From the 1980s to the 2000s, 38% (22%) and 17% (18%) of pixels showed an increased (decreased) carbon uptake and decreased (increased) carbon release, respectively. Uncertainty assessment suggested that there would be higher confidence in NEE estimates in most parts of middle-to high-latitude regions in the Northern Hemisphere.

This study aimed at isolation and identification of M. haemolytica and P. multocida associated with pneumonic pasteurellosis in sheep and goats using bacteriological and molecular techniques. Identification of serotypes of M. haemolytica and P. multocida was done using indirect haemagglutination test. The in vitro antimicrobial sensitivity profiles of the M. haemolytica were tested using standard disk diffusion method. A total of 52 and 78 nasal swabs were collected from pneumonic cases for bacterial isolation and identification in Borana and Arsi zone, respectively. Four hundred sera samples were collected for identification of serotypes. The results showed that 17 of 52 (32.69%; 95% CI 20.33, 47.11) nasal swabs collected from pneumonic animals in Borana yielded positive results for Pasteurella/Mannheimia species, 13 (25.00%; 95% CI 14.03, 38.95) of which were M. haemolytica. None of the samples yielded P. multocida. Twenty-three of 78 (29.49%; 95% CI 19.69, 40.89) nasal swabs collected at Arsi from pneumonic animals yielded positive results for M. haemolytica (17) and P. multocida (6). Secondary biochemical characterization revealed that 14 of the 17 isolates conform to M. haemolytica whereas none of the 6 isolates suspected to be P. mutocida were confirmed. Eleven (84.62%) isolates from Borana and 4 (28.57%) from Arsi were confirmed to be M. haemolytica using PCR targeting the Rpt2 genes. Assay for M. haemolytica serotype A1 revealed all belong to A1. None of the isolates with cultural and morphological features of P. multocida gave positive results by molecular assay. Serological assay identified three serotypes of M. haemolytica namely A1, A2 and A7 almost in all of the samples whereas P. multocida serotype A was detected in 78.75% of the samples. The M. haemolytica isolates tested for susceptibility to antibiotics showed resistance against Bacitracin (83.33%) and Penicillin (50.00%) while they were found susceptible to Gentamycin (100%), Chloramphenicol (100%) and Sulfamethoxazole (100%) and Tetracycline (83.33%). In conclusion, the results of the present study revealed the association of M. haemolytica with pneumonic pasteurellosis in sheep and goats and can be of use in vaccine development in Ethiopia. Nevertheless, further investigations and continuous monitoring of antimicrobial resistance and appropriate selection and prudent use of antimicrobials in livestock sector are required.

However, the performance of the combination of different biochar application amounts and intercropping system is not clear. The objectives of this study were to determine how biochar and intercropping affected soil water, soil pH and nutrients, plant growth, yield, irrigation water - fertilizer use efficiency, and economic benefits for cotton monoculture and cotton-sugarbeet intercropping system, and find the optimal biochar application amount and application years. A three-year cotton-sugarbeet intercropping with biochar application experiment were conducted compared with cotton monoculture. The biochar was continuously applied to the field at the rates of 0, 10, 50 and 100 t ha  1 in 2018, 0, 10, 25, 50 and100 t ha  1 in 2019 and 0, 10, 25 and 30 t ha  1 in 2020. The soil water, nutrients, cotton growth, cotton and sugarbeet yields, water and fertilizer use efficiency and economic benefits were studied. The combination of biochar and cotton-sugarbeet intercropping has several positive effects compared to the cotton monoculture system. The soil water condition was improved. The comprehensive fertility of soil was increased by 3.9-28.3%. The cotton yields, water and fertilizer use efficiency and economic benefits were increased by 0.5-43.8%, 43.3-135.3% and 11.5-65.6%, respectively. The multicriteria assessment showed that the biochar application amount at 10 t ha  1 treatment performed the best with the highest scale every year. The multivariate nonlinearity equation implicated that three years of a continuous biochar application amount of 16.6 t ha  1 was an efficient mode to improve IWUE. The research provides a new insight for agricultural production in the arid and semi-arid.																			0926-6690	1872-633X				FEB	2023	192								116060	10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.116060	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.116060													WOS:001029426900001

Identification of the missing links in parasite-host networks using the dark diversity concept: a case study with two taxonomic groups of ectoparasitic arthropods and small mammalian hosts	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Dark diversity (DD) is represented by species that may potentially inhabit a locality but are absent. We applied this approach to identify missing species and links in the interaction networks of fleas and gamasid mites with small mammals and asked (a) which factors affect host, parasite or interaction (= link) DD and (b) whether the probability of an interaction to be missing is associated with the host and/or the parasite traits. The DD of both parasite taxa increased with an increase in host DD. The DD of interactions increased with an increase in the DD of the respective parasite taxon. The quantity of missing flea-host links was affected by environment, whereas that of mite-host links was affected by host DD. The values of the probability of an interaction to belong to DD were similar (= repeatable) within host and flea, but not mite, species. The probability of a flea-host and a mite-host interaction to be missing was higher if social hosts that possessed complex shelter, had low population densities but large geographic ranges. The probability of a flea-host interaction to be missing was higher if a flea species was not abundant and preferred to spend most of its life on either the body or nest of its host but not both. In conclusion, we propose a relatively simple way to apply the dark diversity concept to assess the quantity of missing links in parasite-host networks, to identify these links, and to relate the probability of a link to be missing with parasite and/or host traits.

Sequence variations and gene expression level differences suggest that TIR-NBS and LRR-RLK are candidate genes associated with FW-resistance. Fusarium wilt (FW) caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. raphani is an important disease in radish, leading to severe decrease in yield and quality. YR4 as a novel genetic source to resistant to FW was confirmed through screening with five pathogen isolates. We have generated F-2 and F-2:3 populations segregated with FW resistance using YR4 and YR18 inbred lines. The disease symptom was evaluated in F-2:3 population (n = 180) in three independent studies over two years. We identified 4 QTL including the two major QTL (FoRsR7.1(59A) and FoRsR9.3(59A)). FoRsR7.1(59A) and FoRsR9.3(59A) were detected in three replicated experiments. FoRsR7.1(59A) was delimited to the 2.18-Mb physical interval on chromosome R07, with a high LOD value (5.17-12.84) and explained phenotypic variation (9.34%-27.97%). The FoRsR9.3(59A) represented relatively low LOD value (3.38-4.52) and explained phenotypic variation (6.24%-8.82%). On the basis of the re-sequencing data for the parental lines, we identified five putative resistance-related genes and 13 unknown genes with sequence variations at the gene and protein levels. A semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that Rs382940 (TIR-NBS) and Rs382200 (RLK) were expressed only in 'YR4' from 0 to 6 days after the inoculation. Moreover, Rs382950 (TIR-NBS-LRR) was more highly expressed in 'YR4' from 3 to 6 days after the inoculation. These three genes might be important for FW-resistance in radish. We identified several markers based on these potential candidate genes. The marker set should be useful for breeding system to introduce the FW resistance loci from 'YR4' to improve tolerance to FW.

It can release NH4+-N via biodegradation, which can enhance N supply to soil thereafter promote plant growth and plant resistance to PTEs. However, the advanced feature of released N in the EDDS-enhanced phytoextraction remains unclear. In the current study, the effects of N supply released from EDDS on ryegrass phytoextraction and plant resistance to PTEs were investigated in detail by a comparison with urea. Our results supported that the addition of both EDDS and urea increased N concentration in soil solution, yet EDDS needed more time to release available N for plant uptake and transported more N from root to shoot. Additionally, EDDS significantly increased the concentration of all targeted PTEs, i.e. Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb, in the soil solution, which results in higher levels of their occurrence in plant biomass compared with urea. By contrast, the supply of N slightly enhanced the ryegrass uptake of micro-nutrients, i.e. Cu and Zn, yet it caused negligible effects on nonessential elements, i.e. Cd and Pb. The mobilized PTEs by EDDS lead to elevated oxidative stress because higher levels of malondialdehyde and O-2(center dot-) were observed. The supply of N attenuated oxidative stress caused by O-2(center dot-) and H2O2, which was associated with enhanced activities of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase. Our results advanced the understanding of the exogenous N supply and metal resistance mechanisms in the EDDS-enhanced phytoextraction. This study also highlighted that EDDS can serve as a N source to ease N-deficient problems in PTEs-contaminated soils. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The objective of this study was to analyze the variation in key soil properties as influenced by different land use types (cropland, grazing land, and bushland) and sustainable land management (SLM) practices (soil bund reinforced with grass, and fanya juu for croplands, and exclosures with and without trenches for grazing and bushlands) in the three contrasting agro-ecological zones of the drought-prone Upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia. Nine soil properties-texture, bulk density (BD), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), cation exchange capacity (CEC), total nitrogen (TN), soil organic carbon (SOC), available phosphorus (P-av), and available potassium (K-av)-were measured for topsoil (0-20 cm) samples collected from experimental plots established for monitoring runoff and soil loss rates. The results showed that seven of the nine studied soil properties significantly differed among the three land use types in the three agro-ecological zones (P< 0.05 to P< 0.001); pH, CEC, SOC, and TN values were generally lower in croplands than in others. These results imply that soil quality under crop production has been greatly deteriorated by unsustainable cropping systems practiced over centuries. Three years after the implementation of SLM practices, however, most soil parameters become within optimal ranges for supporting plant production. More particularly, sensitive soil properties (BD, SOC, TN, P-av, and K-av) showed remarkable improvement in plots where soil bunds reinforced with grass and exclosures were implemented. This improvement was primarily associated with the development of well-established vegetation cover owing to the favorable natural conditions maintained by fencing of plots and minimum tillage. These results therefore indicate that soil degradation can best be controlled through enhancing vegetation growth and reducing soil disturbance by tillage operations. We conclude that integrating land uses with suitable SLM practices is the most effective way to maintain and restore soil quality and sustain ecosystem functioning.

To identify which forest management practices, alleviate soil nutrient limitation and impact stoichiometric homeostasis in relation to microbes, we used a Pinus tabuliformis plantation in the Loess Plateau where forest management practices were conducted since 1999. Five forest management practices were implemented: two at the forest level (P. tabuliformis with and without ground litter, CK, LRL) and three of different vegetation restorations after clear-cutting (P. tabuliformis seedlings (SPL), grass land (GL), and shrub land (SL)). Generally, the threshold elemental ratios for carbon:nitrogen (TERC:N; 7.77) and carbon:phosphorus (TERCP; 44.37) were lower than the ratios influenced by forest management practices. The forest management practices significantly influenced ecoenzymatic activity and the ratios of ecoenzymes; however, the scale of the ecoenzyme activities for acquiring both organic N and organic P to that for acquiring C still follow the global pattern. The regression coefficients of C:N and C:P between the soil and microbial community at 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm depths were also influenced by these practices. Thus, the influence of forest management practices on the soil microbial community was limited by N and P in the Loess Plateau. The soil microbial community changed ecoenzymatic activities and ratios of ecoenzymes and even changed microbial community in order to balance elemental limitations in the soil. Finally, forest management practices have a minimal impact on the stoichiometric homeostasis of the microbial community at our study site.

A patented soil amendment (SA) can effectively relieve the CC obstacles to strawberry cultivation, but knowledge of the recovery mechanisms underlying this phenomenon is limited. Results In this study, transcriptomic profiling of strawberry roots in soil with and without the SA was conducted using RNA-Seq technology to reveal gene expression changes in response to SA treatment. In total, 188 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 144 upregulated and 44 downregulated DEGs, were identified. SA treatment resulted in genotype-dependent responses, and the response pattern, including an overall increase in the expression of nutrient transport genes and a decrease in the expression of defense response genes, may be a possible mechanism underlying recovery strategies in strawberry roots after the application of the SA to CC soil. We also found that 9 Hsp genes involved in plant defense pathways were all downregulated in the SA-treated roots. Conclusions This research indicated that strawberry plants reallocated defense resources to development when SA treatment alleviated the stress caused by a CC soil environment. The present study provides an opportunity to reveal the fundamental mechanisms of the tradeoff between growth and defense in strawberry.

The collected soils were used as inocula to assess the influence of indigenous AM fungi on the growth of two typical pasture grass species,?Elymus nutans?and?Poa pratensis, in a bioassay experiment. Five growth parameters and two AM parameters were determined. The mycorrhizal responsiveness and the importance value were calculated. Significant differences between the eight poisonous plants and CK were observed. Compared to CK, rhizosphere soil from the eight poisonous plants had lower AM fungal spore densities. The growth of?E. nutans?and?P. pratensis?seedlings was depressed with the inoculation from poisonous plants rhizosphere soil. This study demonstrated that the presence of poisonous plants with grassland degradation altered inherent AM fungal community abundance, and could exert inhibition effects on the growth of pasture grasses. It may attribute to discover the important role of rhizosphere soil of different poisonous plants to AM fungal community on the Alpine meadow.

But to realize efficiency gains, digital applications may need to address heterogeneous information needs by targeting agricultural advisory contents in a household-specific way. We explore the feasibility of an automated advisory service that collects household data from farmers, for example through the keypads of conventional mobile phones, and uses this data to prioritize agricultural advisory messages accordingly. To reduce attrition, such a system must avoid lengthy inquiry. Therefore, our objective was to identify a viable trade-off between low data requirements and useful household-specific prioritizations of advisory messages. At three sites in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania independently, we collected experimental preference rankings from smallholder farmers for receiving information about different agricultural and livelihood practices. At each site, we identified socio-economic household variables that improved model-based predictions of individual farmers' information preferences. We used the models to predict household-specific rankings of information options based on 2-4 variables, requiring the farmer to answer between 5 and 10 questions through an ICT interface. These predicted rankings could inform household-specific prioritizations of advisory messages in a digital agro-advisory application. Household-specific "top 3" options suggested by the models were better-fit to farmers' preferences than a random selection of 3 options by 48-68%, on average. The analysis shows that relatively limited data inputs from fanners, in a simple format, can be used to increase the client-orientation of ICT-mediated agricultural extension. This suggests that household-specific prioritization of agricultural advisory messages through digital two-way communication is feasible. In future digital agricultural advisory applications, collecting little data from farmers at each interaction may feed into learning algorithms that continuously improve the targeting of advice.

Dissection and characterization of major stable quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for KNPS would be of considerable value for the genetic improvement of yield potential using molecular breeding technology. We had previously reported a major stable QTL controlling KNPS, qKnps-4A. In the current study, primary fine-mapping analysis, based on the primary mapping population, located qKnps-4A to an interval of approximately 6.8-Mb from 649.0 to 655.8 Mb on chromosome 4A refering to 'Kenong 9204' genome. Further fine-mapping analysis based on a secondary mapping population narrowed qKnps-4A to an approximately 2.19-Mb interval from 653.72 to 655.91 Mb. Transcriptome sequencing, gene function annotation analysis and homologous gene related reports showed that TraesKN4A01HG38570 and TraesKN4A01HG38590 were most likely to be candidate genes of qKnps-4A. Phenotypic analysis based on paired near-isogenic lines in the target region showed that qKnps-4A increased KNPS mainly by increasing the number of central florets per spike. We also evaluated the effects of qKnps-4A on other yield-related traits. Moreover, we dissected the QTL cluster of qKnps-4A and qTkw-4A and proved that the phenotypic effects were probably due to close linkage of two or more genes rather than pleiotropic effects of a single gene. This study provides molecular marker resource for wheat molecular breeding designed to improve yield potential, and lay the foundation for gene functional analysis of qKnps-4A.

Prediction of irrigation water quality indices based on machine learning and regression models	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Assessing irrigation water quality is one of the most critical challenges in improving water resource management strategies. The objective of this work was to predict the irrigation water quality index of the Bahr El-Baqr, Egypt, based on non-expensive approaches that requires simple parameters. To achieve this goal, three artificial intelligence (AI) models (Support vector machine, SVM; extreme gradient boosting, XGB; Random Forest, RF) and four multiple regression models (Stepwise Regression, SW; Principal Components Regression, PCR; Partial least squares regression, PLS; Ordinary least squares regression, OLS) were applied and validated for predicting six irrigation water quality criteria (soluble sodium percentage, SSP; sodium adsorption ratio, SAR; residual sodium carbonate, RSC; potential of salinity, PS; permeability index, PI; Kelly's ratio, KR). Electrical conductivity (EC), sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca2+) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) were used as input exploratory variables for the models. The results indicated the water source is not suitable for irrigation without treatment. A good soil drainage system and salinity control measures are required to avoid salt accumulation within the soil. Based on the performance statistics of the root mean square error (RMSE) and the scatter index (SI), SW emerged as the best (0.21% and 0.03%) followed by PCR and PLS with RMSE 0.22% and 0.21% for SAR, respectively. Based on the classification of the SI, all models applied having values less than 0.1 indicate good prediction performance for all the indices except RSC. These results highlight potential of using multiple regressions and the developed machine learning methods in predicting the index of irrigation water quality, and can be rapid decision tools for modelling irrigation water quality.					kumar, Pankaj/HPF-8395-2023; Elbeltagi, Ahmed/P-4614-2018; Abdel-Fattah, Mohamed Kamal/G-9531-2019	Elbeltagi, Ahmed/0000-0002-5506-9502; Abdel-Fattah, Mohamed Kamal/0000-0002-3705-4817													2190-5487	2190-5495				APR	2022	12	4							76	10.1007/s13201-022-01590-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-022-01590-x													WOS:000771530900001

Quantitatively evaluating the benefits of forest water supply functions is important to effectively mitigate the impacts of land development, climate change, and population growth. Here, by integrating a water balance model and national drinking water data, we determined the amount of surface water yield originating on different forest ownership types at a fine resolution (88,000 watersheds) and tracked that water through the river network to drinking water intakes and the populations they serve. We found that forested lands comprised 36% of the total land area but contributed 50% of the total surface water yield. Of the 23,983 public surface drinking water intakes depending on surface water sources, 89% (serving around 150 million people) received some (>0.01%) surface water from forested lands, and 38% (serving about 60 million people) received more than 50% of their surface drinking water supply from forested lands. Privately-owned forests were the most important water source in the eastern U.S., benefiting 16 million people, followed by federal forests (14.4% of the total water supply). In contrast, federally-owned forested lands were the dominant water source (52% of the total water supply) in the West. Privately-owned forests are the most vulnerable to future land use change and associated water supply impacts. Continuing programs that support private forest landowners with financial and technical assistance through federal and state forest management agencies and potentially developing payment for ecosystem service schemes could maximize benefits for landowners so they may retain their land assets while minimizing forest loss and associated impacts on critical ecosystem services including the provisioning a clean and reliable water supply for the American public.

However, offspring neurodevelopmental outcomes following in utero exposure to these medications remain unclear.Objective To investigate the association between timing of in utero exposure to corticosteroids and beta 2-adrenergic agonists and offspring neurodevelopmental milestones during the first 3 years of life.Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study obtained data from the Japan Environment and Children's Study, an ongoing birth cohort study conducted in collaboration with 15 Regional Centers across Japan. Participants were mother-offspring pairs who were recruited between January 1, 2011, and March 31, 2014. Data were analyzed between January and February 2023.Exposure Corticosteroids and beta 2-adrenergic agonists were the exposure of interest. Timing of corticosteroid and beta 2-adrenergic agonist exposure included early pregnancy (weeks 0-12), mid- to late pregnancy (weeks >12), and both stages of pregnancy.Main Outcomes and Measures Offspring neurodevelopmental milestones (communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem-solving, and personal-social skills) were assessed using the Japanese version of the Ages and Stages Questionnaires, 3rd edition, at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months.Results In total, 91 460 mother-offspring pairs were analyzed. Among mothers, the mean (SD) age at delivery was 31.20 (5.05) years. Among offspring, 46 596 (50.9%) were males and 44 864 (49.1%) were females, of whom 66.4% had a gestational age of 39 to 41 weeks. During early, mid- to late, and both stages of pregnancy, 401 (0.4%), 935 (1.0%), and 568 (0.6%) offspring, respectively, were exposed to corticosteroids, whereas 170 (0.2%), 394 (0.4%), and 184 (0.2%), respectively, were exposed to beta 2-adrenergic agonists. No association of corticosteroid exposure during early, mid- to late, and both stages of pregnancy with all 5 neurodevelopmental milestones was found. Similarly, no association between beta 2-adrenergic agonist use during early pregnancy and all 5 neurodevelopmental milestones was observed. An association was found between beta 2-adrenergic agonist exposure during mid- to late pregnancy and delayed personal-social skills (adjusted odds ratio, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.01-2.32; P = .045).Conclusions and Relevance Results of this study found no association between in utero corticosteroid and beta 2-adrenergic agonist exposure and offspring neurodevelopmental outcomes, regardless of the timing of exposure. Despite the limitations and low power of the study, the findings suggest that corticosteroids and beta 2-adrenergic agonists are safe for pregnant individuals with asthma and the neurodevelopment of their offspring.

The establishment of a viable soil seed bank is the key to successful restoration, as it enhances the resilience of vegetation. However, little is known of how the soil seed bank affects vegetation resilience following long-term active restoration of degraded grasslands. We determined seed abundance and species composition of the soil seed bank and soil properties and vegetation resilience of intact, degraded, and long-term (> 10 years) actively restored grasslands on the Tibetan plateau (3900-4200 m a.s.l.). The plant-soil-seed bank quality index and structural equation modelling (SEM) were used to assess the effect of the soil seed bank on vegetation resilience. After long-term (> 10 years) active restoration of degraded grasslands by sowing seeds of native plant species, the densities of transient and persistent seeds increased by 5%, but seed richness (number of species) decreased by 25% when compared with degraded grasslands. This occurred largely as a result of an increase in grass but decrease in forb seeds. Persistent seeds of grasses play an important role in the productivity of restored grasslands, while the density of persistent seeds serves as an indicator of the resilience of vegetation. A combination of the plant community and soil properties determined seed density. Here, we show for the first time that long-term active restoration enhances vegetation resilience of grasslands by altering the soil seed bank. A high seed density of sown Gramineae and a low seed density of forbs in the soil seed bank is a key to the successful active restoration of degraded grasslands.

The river of the watershed drains into Lake Tana, one of the largest lakes in Ethiopia. Study focus: This study evaluated the impacts of five alternative land capability-based land use and management options in reducing runoff and sediment loss by integrating observed plot- and watershed-scale data with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool. New hydrological insights: We modified flow- and sediment-sensitive model parameters based on six best-performing plot-scale land management practices to simulate the runoff and sediment loss of the watershed under five alternative options. The results revealed that alternative land use options could reduce runoff and sediment loss by about 21-30% (from 740 to 517 mm) and 32-83% (from 101 to 18 t/ha), respectively, compared to the baseline data. The simulations of best alternative land management options also decreased runoff by 10-41% and sediment loss by 40-89%. Runoff and sediment loss reductions were estimated to be as high as 72% (from 740 to 210 mm) and 95% (from 101 to 5 t/ha), respectively, when land use and land management options are combined. These results indicate that implementing suitable land use and management practices has the potential to rehabilitate degraded watersheds in the sub-humid Ethiopian highlands and similar environments elsewhere.

However, the responses of AM fungal abundance to climate change are unclear. A global-scale meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the response patterns of AM fungal abundance to warming, elevated CO2 concentration (eCO(2)), and N addition. Both warming and eCO(2) significantly stimulated AM fungal abundance by 18.6% (95%CI: 5.9%-32.8%) and 21.4% (15.1%-28.1%) on a global scale, respectively. However, the response ratios (RR) of AM fungal abundance decreased with the degree of warming while increased with the degree of eCO(2). Furthermore, in warming experiments, as long as the warming exceeded 4 degrees C, its effects on AM fungal abundance changed from positive to negative regardless of the experimental durations, methods, periods, and ecosystem types. The effects of N addition on AM fungal abundance are -5.4% (-10.6%-0.2%), and related to the nitrogen fertilizer input rate and ecosystem type. The RR of AM fungal abundance is negative in grasslands and farmlands when the degree of N addition exceeds 33.85 and 67.64 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively; however, N addition decreases AM fungal abundance in forests only when the degree of N addition exceeds 871.31 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). The above results provide an insight into predicting ecological functions of AM fungal abundance under global changes. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

How ectoenzyme stoichiometry ratios mediate the changes in microbial community composition and diversity following the conversion of cropland into grassland remains unknown. This study assessed the effects of soil abiotic, biotic factors, and ectoenzyme stoichiometry ratios on microbial diversity (using high-throughput sequencing) following the conversion of cropland into grassland (Cropland and 5, 10, 15, 25, and 30 year natural successional grasslands). Soil ectoenzyme activities synchronously increased with the increase of bacterial and fungal alpha diversity following the conversion of cropland into grassland. Moreover, biotic and abiotic factors co-explained microbial diversity by the changes of ectoenzyme stoichiometry ratios. Specially, ectoenzyme stoichiometry ratios were strongly related to the relative abundance of predominant fungal phylum (Ascomycota, Basidiomycota) and bacterial phylum (Acidobacteria), and ultimately leading to the microbial life history strategies transiting from the oligotrophic groups with retarded growth, to the copiotrophic groups with rapid growth. These differences of microbial community composition, driven by ectoenzyme stoichiometry ratios, reflect soil microbial nutrient cycling following the conversion of cropland into grassland.

Initially, PbS thin films were deposited on GaAs substrates. Subsequently, PbS films were transformed into PbI2 following treatment with polyiodide solutions. In a second conversion step, MAPbI(3) films were obtained by reacting the films with methylammonium iodide solutions. The effect of the solvent on lead iodide morphology and consequently on MAPbI(3) morphology was demonstrated. Conversion rate was slower with increasing solvent polarity. Optimization of conversion parameters is crucial for reproducibly obtaining continuous and adhesive perovskite films. Photoluminescence measurements showed that chemical treatments can substantially enhance light emission from the films. This route for all-solution-processed perovskites enables control over film morphology while maintaining a simple and low-cost process.

J	Zhang, ZC; Liu, M; Sun, J; Wei, TX				Zhang, Zhenchao; Liu, Miao; Sun, Jian; Wei, Tianxing			Degradation leads to dramatic decrease in topsoil but not subsoil root biomass in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau, China	JOURNAL OF ARID LAND												Understanding the effects of degradation on belowground biomass (BGB) is essential for assessment of carbon budget of the alpine meadow ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau, China. This ecosystem has been undergoing serious degradation owing to climate change and anthropogenic activities. This study examined the response of the vertical distribution of plant BGB to degradation and explored the underlying mechanisms in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. A field survey was conducted in an alpine meadow with seven sequential degrees of degradation in the Zoige Plateau on the Tibetan Plateau during the peak growing season of 2018. We measured aboveground biomass (AGB), BGB, soil water content (SWC), soil bulk density (SBD), soil compaction (SCOM), soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen (STN), soil total phosphorus (STP), soil available nitrogen (SAN), and soil available phosphorus (STP) in the 0-30 cm soil layers. Our results show that degradation dramatically decreased the BGB in the 0-10 cm soil layer (BGB(0-10)) but slightly increased the subsoil BGB. The main reason may be that the physical-chemical properties of surface soil were more sensitive to degradation than those of subsoil, as indicated by the remarked positive associations of the trade-off value of BGB(0-10) with SWC, SCOM, SOC, STN, SAN, and STP, as well as the negative correlation between the trade-off value of BGB(0-10) and SBD in the soil layer of 0-10 cm. In addition, an increase in the proportion of forbs with increasing degradation degree directly affected the BGB vertical distribution. The findings suggest that the decrease in the tradeoff value of BGB(0-10) in response to degradation might be an adaptive strategy for the degradation-induced drought and infertile soil conditions. This study can provide theoretical support for assessing the effects of degradation on the carbon budget and sustainable development in the alpine meadow ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau as well as other similar ecosystems in the world.

Insight into the genetic diversity of germplasm can improve the breeding program management in various traits. This study was done using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) markers to characterize the genetic distinctiveness and differentiation of tetraploid wheat landraces collected from nine European and Asian countries. A sum of 23,334 polymorphic SNPs was detected in 126 tetraploid wheat landraces in relation to the reference genome.ResultsThe number of identified SNPs was 11,613 and 11,721 in A and B genomes, respectively. The highest and lowest diversity was on 6B and 6 A chromosomes, respectively. Structure analysis classified the landraces into two distinct subpopulations (K = 2). Evaluating the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and weighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages (WPGMA) clustering results demonstrated that landraces (99.2%) are categorized into one of the two chief subpopulations. Therefore, the grouping pattern did not clearly show the presence of a clear pattern of relationships between genetic diversity and their geographical derivation. Part of this result could be due to the historical exchange between different germplasms. Although the result did not separate landraces based on their region of origin, the landraces collected from Iran were classified into the same group and cluster. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) also confirmed the results of population structure. Finally, Durum wheat landraces in some countries, including Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, and Afghanistan, were highly diverse, while others, including Iran and China, were low-diversity.ConclusionThe recent study concluded that the 126 tetraploid wheat genotypes and their GBS-SNP markers are very appropriate for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) mapping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The core collection comprises two distinct subpopulations. Subpopulation II genotypes are the most diverse genotypes, and if they possess desired traits, they may be used in future breeding programs. The degree of diversity in the landraces of countries can provide the ground for the improvement of new cultivars with international cooperation. linkage disequilibrium (LD) hotspot distribution across the genome was investigated, which provides useful information about the genomic regions that contain intriguing genes.

Positive plant diversity effects on soil microbial drought resistance are linked to variation in labile carbon and microbial community structure	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												Biodiversity loss and drought are substantially altering both above- and below-ground terrestrial ecosystem functioning, but mechanistic understanding of plant diversity effects on the drought resistance of soil microbial biomass remains limited. We designed a mesocosm experiment to examine drought resistance of soil microbial biomass along a plant species richness gradient (five plant species richness levels based on old-field communities). We calculated resistance of microbial biomass to drought and recorded key below-ground properties which may influence microbial resistance to drought (i.e. microbial diversity, microbial community structure, soil carbon stocks and root biomass). Plant species richness had a positive effect on microbial resistance to drought. Variation in microbial resistance to drought was linked to properties of the fungal community in ambient soil (Shannon diversity, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal richness and abundance) but not soil bacterial diversity. Moreover, microbial resistance to drought increased with increasing root biomass and dissolved organic carbon recorded under ambient conditions. These results highlight the importance of plant diversity for microbial biomass stability in our old-field study system with implications for biogeochemical cycling, and suggest that indirect effects of plant species richness on labile soil carbon and soil fungi may drive resistance of soil microbial biomass to drought.

However, the response of microbial functional genes involved in soil P cycling to mulching practices is largely unknown. We used a metagenomic sequencing approach to analyze microbial functional genes related to soil P cycling in a spring maize field that was mulched with crop straw (SM) and plastic film (FM) for ten years and without mulching (CK). Thirty-nine P cycling functional genes were identified. These genes were involved in organic P-mineralization and inorganic P-solubilization, P-uptake and transport, and P-starvation response regulation. Relative abundances of functional genes coding for P-mineralization and solubilization significantly decreased by 8.8 % and 13.9 % in SM and FM (P < 0.05) than in CK, respectively. FM also decreased the total relative abundance of functional genes involved in P-uptake and transport by 13.2 % (P < 0.05) compared to CK. However, mulching practices did not affect the relative abundance of functional genes related to P-starvation response regulation. Random forest analysis suggested eleven key functional genes coding for soil P cycling as determinants of available P in which the gcd gene encoding PQQGDH was dominant. The Proteobacteria and Actbmbacteria were two dominant phyla for which P cycling genes were taxonomically attributed. The Mantel test indicated that soil C:P ratio, pH, and available P were closely associated with the relative abundances of functional genes responsible for soil P cycling. Overall, this study demonstrated a decrease in the relative abundance of soil P cycling genes with mulching practices in agroecosystems, irrespective of the mulch type. The mechanism may differ depending on the mulch type.																			0929-1393	1873-0272				JUL	2023	187								104833	10.1016/j.apsoil.2023.104833	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2023.104833		FEB 2023											WOS:000933046000001

However, it is still unclear how habitat fragmentation affects frugivorous interactions due to the lack of high-quality data on plant-frugivore networks. Here we recorded 10,117 plant-frugivore interactions from 22 reservoir islands and six nearby mainland sites using the technology of arboreal camera trapping to assess the effects of island area and isolation on the diversity, structure, and stability of plant-frugivore networks. We found that network simplification under habitat fragmentation reduces the number of interactions involving specialized species and large-bodied frugivores. Small islands had more connected, less modular, and more nested networks that consisted mainly of small-bodied birds and abundant plants, as well as showed evidence of interaction release (i.e., dietary expansion of frugivores). Our results reveal the importance of preserving large forest remnants to support plant-frugivore interaction diversity and forest functionality. Smaller communities, such as those on islands, under ecological network simplification reduce interactions between specialist organisms.

Species associations in arthropod ectoparasite infracommunities are spatially and temporally variable and affected by environmental factors	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. We applied a Markov random fields/conditional random fields (MRF/CRF) modelling to understand whether and how species associations in ectoparasite infracommunities of small mammals vary along environmental gradients across space and time. 2. We analysed the variation in species associations in flea and mite infracommunities of seven host species across localities (spatial scale) and time periods (in the same locality; temporal scale). 3. The performance of the CRF models differed between ectoparasite taxa, scales, and host species. The model performance for flea and mite infracommunities in the majority of host species was satisfying although the proportions of correctly predicted positive occurrences and model sensitivity were moderate. 4. The probability of occurrence of many flea and mite species depended mostly on the occurrence of another flea and mite species (respectively), with many negative interspecific interactions, although occurrences of some species were mainly affected by environmental factors. The patterns of pairwise associations between some ectoparasite species were affected by environmental factors. 5. Although many ectoparasite pairs demonstrated stability in the strength or sign of association across space or time, interactions between other species pairs were spatially or temporally variable, with the association between the same pair of species being stable in one host species and variable in another host species. 6. We conclude that ectoparasite associations are mediated by the off-host environment and may depend on the life histories of both host and ectoparasite species.

The objective of this study was to analyse the variation in outflows of soil total nitrogen (TN) and available phosphorus (P-av) as influenced by land use types (cropland, grazing land, and bushland) and land management practices (soil bunds for cropland and exclosures for non-croplands) in the three contrasting agro-ecological zones of the Upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia. Field data were collected for TN and P-av outflows by water erosion (Eo), leaching (Lo), product harvest (Ho), and gaseous emissions (Go) from 18 runoff plots (30 m x 6 m) for two years (2018-2019). TN and P-av losses significantly varied (p < 0.05. p < 0.01) among agro-ecological zones, land use types, and management practices. Losses of TN ranged from 39.6 to 55.5 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) and those of P-av from 4.1 to 5.9 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), with a total replacement cost of US$26-38 ha(-1) yr(-1) Nutrient losses and cost generally increased from lowland (Dibatie) to midland (Aba Gerima) to highland (Guder), although the highland and midland sites did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) in nutrient losses. Cropland showed significantly higher TN and P-av losses than other land use types, but TN loss did not differ significantly between grazing and bushland. In all land use types at all sites, the magnitude of nutrient losses was Ho > Lo > Go. In plots with land management practices, TN and P-av losses associated with Eo, Lo, and Go were reduced on average by 44-76%, 9-47%, and 1%-36%. respectively. These practices were most effective to reduce Eo nutrient losses. Further study is required to analyzing the soil nutrient balance and identify priority areas for implementing mitigation measures.

PbSe was deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), and treated with polyiodide solution to form lead iodide. The solvent used was mixtures of isopropanol and water at different ratios. Conversion parameters, namely solvent ratio, potassium iodide (KI) concentration, iodine (I-2) concentration and conversion temperature were optimized. A second conversion step, from PbI2 to MAPbI(3), was carried out by treating the films with a solution of methylammonium iodide (MAI) dissolved in isopropanol. Different morphologies of MAPbI(3) were achieved by converting PbI2 films with different morphologies, and also by converting PbI2 films using solutions of variable MAI concentration. Effect of grain size on UV-Vis light absorption and photoluminescence (PL) is discussed: while absorption was found to be lower for the films with smaller grain size, PL was higher, suggesting less non-radiative recombination traps in films containing smaller grain perovskites.

Epicuticular wax is responsible for the glaucous appearance of plants and protects against many biotic and abiotic stresses. In wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), beta-diketone is a major component of epicuticular wax in adult plants and contributes to the glaucousness of the aerial organs. In the present study, we identified an ethyl methanesulfonate-induced epicuticular wax-deficient mutant from the elite wheat cultivar Jimai22. Compared to wild-type Jimai22, the mutant lacked beta-diketone and failed to form the glaucous coating on all aerial organs. The mutant also had significantly increased in cuticle permeability, based on water loss and chlorophyll efflux. Genetic analysis indicated that the mutant phenotype is controlled by a single, semidominant gene on the long arm of chromosome 7D, which was not allelic to the known wax gene loci W1-W4, and was therefore designated W5. W5 was finely mapped to an ~ 194-kb region (flanked by the molecular markers SSR2 and STARP11) that harbored four annotated genes according to the reference genome of Chinese Spring (RefSeq v1.0). Collectively, these data will broaden the knowledge of the genetic basis underlying epicuticular wax deposition in wheat.

In this study, we examine the spatiotemporal variability of Rs and the factors that influence it. Mean Rs was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the teff farmland (TC) and khat plantation (KP) than in grazing land (GL) in the midland; Rs rates were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in GL than A. decurrens (AP) and TC in the highland area. In the highlands, seasonal variation of Rs was significantly (p < 0.05) greater in autumn in GL than in TC and AP, but in winter, Rs varied significantly (p < 0.05) more in AP than in TC and GL. In the midland, TC had significantly (p < 0.05) higher Rs than GL in autumn. In addition, TC and KP had significantly higher Rs than GL in winter and spring. In the highlands, S-T explained 0.02-45% Rs variation using the exponential model; however, in the midlands, S-T explained 5-28%. In the midland, the quadratic function explained 32-89% of the variation in the seasonal Rs rates based on S-M, while in the highlands, it explained 11-66%. Moreover, multiple regressions explained 57-80% of the variation in annual Rs rates in midlands based on S-T and S-M, while they explained only 12-32% in the highlands. Thus, Rs was mainly influenced by environmental factors, although it varied spatially and temporally.

Rising temperatures and climate change may lead to increased evapotranspiration, specifically soil evaporation, causing water to evaporate and salt to accumulate in the soil, resulting in increased soil salinity. As a result, there is a need to evaluate methods for predicting and monitoring the effects of salinity on crop growth and production through rapid screening. Our study was conducted on 20 wheat genotypes, 10 sensitive and 10 tolerant, exposed to two salinity levels (90 and 120 mM NaCl) with the control under greenhouse conditions. Our results revealed significant differences in the genotypes' response to salinity. Salt stress decreased chlorophyll index in sensitive genotypes but increased chlorophyll a and carotenoids in tolerant genotypes at 90 mM. Salt stress also increased protein, proline, lipoxygenase, and reactive thiobarbituric acid levels in all wheat genotypes. The study suggests that plant photosynthetic efficiency is a reliable, non-destructive biomarker for determining the salt tolerance of wheat genotypes, while other biochemical traits are destructive and time-consuming and therefore not suitable for rapid screening.					faid, sobhi/ABP-4190-2022; Yousef, Ahmed Fathy/AAA-1316-2022; Kalaji, Mohamed Hazem/E-8086-2012	faid, sobhi/0000-0002-5003-9275; Yousef, Ahmed Fathy/0000-0002-6614-5566; Kalaji, Mohamed Hazem/0000-0002-3833-4917; Ali, Muhammad Moaaz/0000-0002-3092-6328													1932-6203					MAR 31	2023	18	3							e0282606	10.1371/journal.pone.0282606	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0282606								37000787					WOS:000967546000020

The purpose of this study was to analyze runoff and SL from different land use types and evaluate the effectiveness of different SLM practices through monitoring runoff and sediment from 42 runoff plots (30 m x 6 m) in different agro-ecologies of the Upper Blue Nile basin of Ethiopia. Four treatments for croplands (control, soil bund, Fanya juu, and soil bund reinforced with grass) and three treatments for non-croplands (control, exclosure, and exclosure with trenches) were investigated during the rainy seasons. The results showed that runoff and SL varied greatly depending on agro-ecology, land use type, and SLM practice. Seasonal runoff ranged from 52 to 810 mm in 2015 and 37 to 898 mm in 2016, whereas SL ranged from 0.07 to 39.67 t ha(-1) and 0.01 to 24.70 t ha(-1). The highest rates were observed from untreated grazing land in the midland agro-ecology, largely because of heavy grazing and the occurrence of intense rain events. Runoff and SL were both significantly lower (P < 0.05) in SLM plots than in control plots. On average, seasonal runoff was reduced by 11% to 68%, and SL by 38% to 94% in SLM plots. Soil bund reinforced with grass in croplands and exclosure with trenches in non-croplands were found to be the most effective SLM practices for reducing both runoff and SL. Integrating structural and vegetative measures was therefore found to be the best way to control soil erosion and its consequences. Additional investigation is needed in consideration of ecological succession and other possible effects of these types of integrated measures, for example, the effects on soil properties, biomass, and biodiversity.

However, current SIF-based GPP estimations regard the canopy as a large leaf and seldom consider the impact of interactions among light, canopy structure, and leaf physiology. In this study, we proposed GPP estimation models with different descriptions of light-structure-physiology interactions (including the layered model, the two-leaf model, and the layered two-leaf model) and compared their performances with the big-leaf model using half-hourly (or hourly) observations at evergreen needleleaf forest sites. First, we found that the big-leaf model underestimated GPP, especially at noon. All models showed higher accuracy than that of the big-leaf model. Second, we investigated the diurnal dynamics of GPP estimations in each canopy layer and found that models with a two-leaf assumption captured the diurnal variations in GPP better than that with the layered assumption. We also deduced that the poor performance of the big-leaf model was related to its overestimation of the overall light stress on the redox state of PSII reaction centers (qL). Finally, we noticed that the qL at the canopy scale had lower sensitivity to light change than the single-leaf qL and that the light response of canopy-scale qL was influenced by the leaf area index during seasonal cycles. Overall, this study describes methods to accurately estimate sub-daily GPP from SIF in evergreen needleleaf forests and demonstrates that the interactions among light, canopy structure, and leaf physiology regulate the SIF-GPP relationship at the canopy scale. Further, it indicates the need to consider the description of light distribution within the canopy in next generation terrestrial biosphere models, even if they incorporate SIF to constrain their parameterization. Thus, upscaling the established leaf-scale mechanistic SIF-GPP relationship or findings to canopy-scale applications still requires much work, especially when there are significant changes in environmental conditions and their within-canopy distributions.																			0034-4257	1879-0704				JAN 1	2024	300								113919	10.1016/j.rse.2023.113919	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2023.113919		NOV 2023											WOS:001125697300001

AimsThis study aimed to develop an evaluation tool to determine genotypic variation in low-P tolerance and P use efficiency under low P environments. MethodsRoot response and P efficiency traits in 20 maize genotypes with contrasting root systems were assessed 32 days after transplanting into the semi-hydroponic root phenotyping system under low P (10 mu M) or optimal P (200 mu M) supply. ResultsCompared to optimal P, low P supply increased root-to-shoot biomass ratio by 48.7% (shoot dry weight decreased by 20.0% and root dry weight increased by 20.6%). Low P supply increased total root length by 17.8% but decreased primary root depth, with no significant change in lateral root number across all genotypes. Low P stress enhanced P utilization efficiency. Based on genotypic variation and correlations among the 17 measured plant traits in response to low P stress, nine traits were converted to low-P tolerance coefficients (LPTC), compressed by principal component analysis. The three principal component scores were extracted for hierarchical cluster analysis and classified the 20 genotypes into three groups with different P efficiency, including two P-efficient genotypes and nine P-inefficient genotypes. ConclusionsThe study demonstrated genotypic variation in response to low P stress. The P-efficient genotypes with higher LPTC values better adapted to low P environments by adjusting root architecture and re-distributing P and biomass in plant organs. The systematic cluster analysis using selected traits and their LPTC values can be used as an evaluation tool in assessing P efficiency among the genotypes.

A balanced interaction between the rangeland's hydrology and vegetation states is vital for achieving long-term sustainability. To gain a better insight into the impact of restoration on surface runoff and erosion and its role in recovering the ecosystem functions, we used the Rangeland Hydro-logical and Erosion Model (RHEM) to simulate various vegetation scenarios. Our research aims to un-derstand the rangelands' water and sediment dynamics and the vegetation transition states of the ecosystem through evaluating the current (degraded) situation, assess the restoration approach on improving the degraded status (restored), and investigate the long-term sustainability of the restoration approach compared with historical rangeland conditions (baseline). Several scenarios were developed with rangeland experts, local community representatives, and measurements at protected and restored areas to represent the rangeland conditions. We found that restoration of the degraded Badia areas will decrease annual surface runoff from an average of 23.5 to 19.1 mm/year and soil erosion rate from 3.3 to 1.3 tons/ha. With time, restoration can bring back rangeland water and sediment dynamics closer to-wards the baseline conditions, which were 16.9 mm/year runoff rates and 0.85 ton/ha/year soil loss. The results indicate that restoration is a promising methodology to restore the degraded ecosystem and approximate the environment's historical hydrological regime.(c) 2022 International Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation, China Water and Power Press, and China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research.

This study investigated the impacts of geographic unit difference on soil erosion in the Shaanxi Province in China through the model simulation (RUSLE) and quantitative analysis. The following results were achieved. First, the amplitudes of environmental change varied at different rates in the three regions over the past 35 years (1980-2015). The frequency of severe rainstorms, the main trigger for soil erosion, intensified most in the Loess Plateau compared to the Qinling Mountains and Guanzhong Plain and led to an increase in the number of geological disasters in that region. In addition, after the 1990s, vegetation improved most in the Loess Plateau, and socioeconomic activities related to urbanization, another important driver of soil erosion, increased the most in Guanzhong Plain. Second, improved vegetation cover was the most significant contributor to the reduction in soil erosion during the past 35 years, although intensified rainstorms and human activities enhanced the risks of soil erosion. Third, the comparative study revealed that different environmental parameters dominated soil erosion processes in the three regions.					lin, Yunhong 蔺云宏/HCG-9370-2022	lin, Yunhong 蔺云宏/0000-0002-5066-138X														2071-1050				SEP	2022	14	17							10512	10.3390/su141710512	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su141710512													WOS:000851756900001

This study evaluated the separate and combined impacts of soil and water conservation (SWC) practices, land use/land cover, and climate variability, on runoff and sediment yield (SY) using two approaches in drought-prone watersheds of northwestern Ethiopia. In the first (paired watershed) approach, runoff and SY outputs of Kecha (treated) and Laguna (untreated) watersheds were compared. In the second approach, we compared data before and after the implementation of SWC practices in the Kecha watershed. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was adopted for both untreated and treated watersheds and used to evaluate runoff and SY responses in the two approaches. Paired watershed approach results revealed that the SWC practices reduced the surface runoff in Kecha by about 28-36% and SY by about 51-68% as compared to those in Laguna. Similarly, compared with the baseline data at Kecha, the SWC practices reduced the surface runoff and SY by about 40% and 43%, respectively, corresponding to about 65-78% of the total changes brought by changes in land use/land cover and climate variability. Hence, combining the two approaches helped reasonably estimate the reduction of surface runoff and SY due to SWC practices by about 28-40% and about 43-68%, respectively, implying that SWC practices had a considerably greater effect on SY than surface runoff. The study further revealed that the untreated Laguna watershed, where >86% of the total area is categorized as the very high soil erosion severity class, should be an immediate conservation priority. The findings of this study will be vital to devise future alternative land management scenarios in these watersheds and similar agro-ecological areas elsewhere. (C) 2020 The Authors.

However, large uncertainties remain in assessing the impact of human activities on terrestrial ecosystems. In consequence, we established a quantitative indicator based on terrestrial potential and actual net primary productivity (NPP), as well as the forage harvest NPP, to better reveal the spatiotemporal changes of grassland ecosystems in response to human activities in eastern Inner Mongolia, and to further explore the relationship between human activities and grassland degradation in typical ecologically fragile areas. The quantitative indicator showed that NPP loss induced by human activities is weakening in the study area, and a positive relationship between human activities and grassland degradation was found. The results of this study will provide a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the grassland degradation influenced by human activities, and a method reference for similar research. Global enhanced human activities have deeply influenced grassland ecosystems. Quantifying the impact of human activities on grasslands is crucial to understanding the grassland dynamic change mechanism, such as grassland degradation, and to establishing ecosystem protection measures. In this study, potential net primary productivity (PNPP), actual NPP (ANPP), and the forage harvest NPP (HNPP) were employed to establish the human activities index (HAI) to reveal the spatiotemporal changes of the effects of human activities on grassland ecosystems in eastern Inner Mongolia from 2000 to 2017, and to further explore the relationship between human activities and grassland degradation. The results showed that the total average PNPP, ANPP, and HNPP of grasslands in eastern Inner Mongolia were 187.2 Tg C yr(-1), 152.3 Tg C yr(-1), and 8.9 Tg C yr(-1), respectively, during the period of 2000 to 2017. The HAI exhibited a clear decreasing trend during the study period, with annual mean values ranging from 0.75 to 0.47, which indicates that the NPP loss induced by human activities is weakening, and this trend is dominated by the difference between potential NPP and actual NPP. About 42.4% of the study area was non-degraded grassland, and the declining grassland degradation index (GDI) indicated that the degradation grade in eastern Inner Mongolia improved from moderate to light degradation. A positive relationship was found between HAI and GDI. This relationship was more significant in Xilingol League, which is a typical ecologically fragile area, than that in Xing'an League and Hulunbuir City.

Hence, it is urgent to assess the green development level of cultivated land (GDL-CL). The objective of this study was to develop a new multi-dimensional framework considering environmental impacts to assess GDL-CL based on "elements - processes - dimensions - goals - drivers" according to the interaction between the soil-water-plant -atmosphere system (SWPAS) and CLUS. The entropy weight method, spatial autocorrelation analysis, and the Geodetector method were applied to provincial data in China from 1990 to 2018 to determine the spatiotemporal evolution, correlation, and quantitative attributes, respectively, of GDL-CL. The results indicated that the changing agricultural input-output farming patterns in China during 1990-2018 followed U-shaped trend in GDL-CL that reached an inflection point in 1998. In addition, GDL-CL differed significantly between the eastern and western regions in China, with the eastern areas showing an obviously high-high agglomeration and the western areas showing an apparently low-low agglomeration. The reason behind this phenomenon is that climate and socio-economic factors such as temperature, precipitation, sunshine, assets, markets, education, employ-ment, and policies profoundly and extensively influenced GDL-CL in different regions during 1990-2018. However, the contribution of climate factors to GDL-CL overtook the socio-economic factors in 2010-2018. Therefore, this study suggests that priority should be given to optimizing production modes of cultivation, coordinating regional GDL-CL contradictions, and warning of climate change to sustainably manage cultivated land.

Quantitative reconstruction of soil erosion, sediment transport, and delta deposition in the basin enhances understanding of the dynamic mechanisms of fluvial surface processes. This study reconstructs the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation and vegetation cover based on geological profile records, paleoclimatic datasets, and historical documentation in the Yellow River basin during the Holocene. A landscape evolution model (Landlab) is introduced to simulate soil erosion and sediment deposition processes. Modeling results show that soil erosion intensity in the middle reaches of the Yellow River was weak during the early and middle Holocene. Since the late Holocene, soil erosion has increased due to vegetation degradation, as the climate became drier, but with more fluctuations. Since 2.0 ka (1 ka = 1,000 calibrated a B.P.), and especially since 1.0 ka, soil erosion in the middle reaches of the Yellow River increased rapidly due to strong human activity, with the intensity-six times higher than the average level before the late Holocene. Average sediment deposition thickness in the lower reach of the Yellow River (North China Plain) was about 2.4 m, and sediment volume was about 3.6 x 1011 m3. The deposition rate and soil erosion intensity showed synchronous changes during the Holocene. Since 2.0 ka, the sediment load and deposition rate have increased rapidly, to 6-10 times higher than in the early and middle Holocene. On this basis, the effects of climate change and human activities on the evolution of the fluvial landscape are discussed.					Delang, Claudio O.

Due to their diversity and heterogeneity, researches have mainly investigated the effect of solution chemistry on the stability of soil NPs, but little attention is paid to the influences of particle properties. Methods In the present study, NPs were separated from the eluviated cinnamon soil (ECS), typical cinnamon soil (TCS), and carbonate cinnamon soil (CCS), namely ECS-NP, TCS-NP, and CCS-NP. The particle composition, surface-related properties, and the aggregation kinetics of soil NPs were investigated. Correlation analyses between soil NP properties and their critical coagulation concentrations (CCCs) were further discussed. Results The bulk ECS, TCS, and CCS differed highly in CaCO3 content. While in soil NP fractions, the contents of soil organic matter and illite were more abundant. The particle size, specific surface area, and Hamaker constant of soil NPs followed the order of ECS-NP < TCS-NP < CCS-NP, while the yield, zeta potential (in absolute values), and the CCCs were in the reverse trend. The particle diameter, specific surface area, and zeta potential significantly correlated with the CCCs. Conclusion The present study revealed the important role of particle properties in dominating the stability (aggregation and dispersion) of soil NPs. Therefore, it is necessary to further systematically explore the composition of soil NPs on dominating their environmental behaviors.																			1439-0108	1614-7480				JUN	2022	22	6					1761	1772		10.1007/s11368-022-03176-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-022-03176-1		MAR 2022											WOS:000766998700001

Most collapsing gullies are formed on a well-developed granite crust; thus, granite residual soil plays a critical role. However, the extent to which the geotechnical features of residual soil, especially soil disintegration, affects collapsing gully formation is poorly understood. This study performed laboratory disintegration tests on granite residual soil taken from the red soil, sandy soil, and detritus layers of a collapsing gully. The disintegration behaviour was quantified by defining the disintegration ratio, R-d, and three equivalent disintegration rates, v(I), v(II,) and vI(II), corresponding to R-d =10%, 30%, and 50%, respectively. The results revealed that the red soil layer (depth < 1.3 m) and the soil at the shallower depth of the sandy soil layer (depth < 3.0 m) showed similar disintegration behaviours, which were complete (R-d = 100%) and rapid, with vI values in the range of 66.7-266.7%/min. The soil disintegration in the sandy soil layer was characterised by an incremental increase in R-d to 100% within 100 min. The residual soil at the bottom of the sandy soil layer and the top of the detritus layer (depths of 4.0-8.0 m) disintegrated consistently at the first, after which the disintegration rate gradually decreased with v(III) lower than 1%/min. The detritus layer soil at a depth greater than 10.0 m showed incomplete disintegration, and the ultimate R-d was approximately 60%. The formation mechanism for the soil disintegration and gully collapse was also proposed. The weakening of cementation triggered the breakup of soil aggregates and led to soil disintegration and the occurrence of a gully collapse. This study provided new insights on gully erosion.

In the past few decades, the Yellow River (YR) basin faced enormous social and environmental sustainability challenges associated with environmental degradation, soil erosion, vegetation restoration, and economic development, which makes it important to understand the long-term land use/cover dynamics of this region. Here, using three decades of Landsat imagery (17,080 images) and incorporating physiography data, we developed an effective annual land use/cover mapping framework and provided a set of 90 m resolution continuous annual land use/cover maps of the YR basin from 1986 to 2018 based on the Google Earth Engine and the Classification and Regression Trees algorithm. The independent random sampling validations based on the field surveys (640 points) and Google Earth (3456 points) indicated that the overall accuracy of these maps is 78.3% and 80.0%, respectively. The analysis of the land system of the YR basin showed that this region presents complex temporal and spatial changes, and the main change patterns include no change or little change, cropland loss and urban expansion, grassland restoration, increase in orchard and terrace, and increase in forest during the entire study period. The major land use/cover change has occurred in the transitions from forests, grasslands, and croplands to the class of orchard and terrace (19.8% of all change area), which not only increase the greenness but also raised the income, suggesting that YR progress towards sustainable development goals for livelihood security, economic growth, and ecological protection. Based on these data and analysis, we can further understand the role of the land system in the mutual feedback between society and the environment, and provide support for ecological conservation, high-quality development, and the formulation of sustainable management policies in this basin, highlighting the importance of continuous land use/cover information for understanding the interactions between the human and natural systems.

The analysis of 22 studies identified from 419 research articles sheds light on the relationships between aspirations, agriculture, women's empowerment, poverty, and rural youth. Aspirations of the rural poor play a significant role in shaping their activities and investments. Furthermore, the poor and those who are exposed to natural disasters are more likely suffering from aspiration failure and their resilience needs to be built. Specifically, women's empowerment could be supported through raising aspirations. In addition, intergenerational aspirations and corresponding investment plans in agriculture are in absolute contrast and parental desires and their children's aspirations do not align. Overall, development program-specific research is needed to determine policies and programs that successfully and cost-effectively raise the rural poor's aspirations and thereby improve livelihoods in developing countries.

Recent studies have used different machine learning techniques to develop such yield forecast systems for single crops at regional scales. However, no study has used multiple sources of environmental predictors (climate, soil, and vegetation) to forecast yields for three major crops in China. In this study, we adopted 7-year observed crop yield data (2013-2019) for three major grain crops (wheat, maize, and rice) across China, and three major data sets including climate, vegetation indices, and soil properties were used to develop a dynamic yield forecasting system based on the random forest (RF) model. The RF model showed good performance for estimating yields of all three crops with correlation coefficient (r) higher than 0.75 and normalized root means square errors (nRMSE) lower than 18.0%. Our results also showed that crop yields can be satisfactorily forecasted at one to three months prior to harvest. The optimum lead time for yield forecasting depended on crop types. In addition, we found the major predictors influencing crop yield varied between crops. In general, solar radiation and vegetation indices (especially during jointing to milk development stages) were identified as the main predictor for winter wheat; vegetation indices (throughout the growing season) and drought (especially during emergence to tasseling stages) were the most important predictors for spring maize; soil moisture (throughout the growing season) was the dominant predictor for summer maize, late rice, and mid rice; precipitation (especially during booting to heading stages) was the main predictor for early rice. Our study provides insights into practical crop yield forecasting and the understanding of yield response to environmental conditions at a large scale across China. The methods undertaken in this research can be easily implemented in other countries with available information on climate, soil, and vegetation conditions.

Due to the unique climate and the clean air conditions over the TP, it might be feasible to calibrate the angstrom ngstrom-Prescott model with short-term observations from scientific expeditions. To test this hypothesis, we used various datasets with different lengths at four stations, together with 435 daily radiations measured during a scientific expedition at Banga in the central TP from 2014 to 2015, to calibrate the angstrom ngstrom-Prescott model. We found that calibration with a 1-year data length resulted in model performances comparable to those with a 20-year data length. Analysis of the expedition observations showed that the monthly average daily radiation ranged from 15.2 MJ/m(2)d in December 2014 to 26.5 MJ/m(2)d in July 2015, with an average value of 20.6 MJ/m(2)d. When this set of expedition data was used for calibration, the angstrom ngstrom-Prescott model performed well with an NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency) of 0.820. If no data were available for calibration, the coefficients of the angstrom ngstrom-Prescott model could also be directly calculated by parameterization methods established with calibrations at the other radiation stations. In this situation, the LiuJD method performed the best with the highest NSE of 0.792, followed by the LiuXY method with an NSE of 0.764. The FAO method performed poorly with an NSE of 0.578, while the Gopinathan method performed the worst with the lowest NSE of 0.218. Thus, the best strategy to calibrate the angstrom ngstrom-Prescott model in the Tibetan Plateau is to use data from local observations, even if collected over short periods. When these are not available, the coefficients of the angstrom ngstrom-Prescott model should be calculated using the parameterization method established with calibrations over the Tibetan Plateau.																				1996-1073				OCT	2023	16	20							7093	10.3390/en16207093	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16207093													WOS:001092649100001

However, the distribution characteristics of soil and water conservation measures (SWCMs) under ecological restoration projects and the water storage and soil conservation benefits from a macro perspective are not yet clear. To solve this problem, first of all, the red soil hilly region (RSHR) of China has been chosen to analyze the 30-year process and spatial trends of SWCMs in ecological restoration projects. The spatial distribution of SWCMs is analyzed from the three-dimensional plane of level and elevation. In addition, four benefit characteristics of SWCMs have been obtained by comparing the amount of water and soil protected and the intensity of soil erosion. Finally, the paper explores methods that improve the efficiency of SWC in key areas. The research results show that the paradigm of SWC changes from comprehensive management to ecological rules and the goal of SWCMs has shifted from initial farmland maintenance to natural forest restoration, and the average soil erosion has not only decreased by 291 t/(km(2).a) as a whole but has also reflected the transformation from agriculture to ecology in the national ecological restoration project strategy. The distribution model of SWCMs on the horizontal plane is a convex second-order function. In the vertical direction, the proportion of measures distributed in hilly areas was 38%, higher than that in plain and mountain areas. Moreover, SWCMs are concentrated in cultivated land and forest land, among which the proportion of terraces, SWC forests and grass planting measures is as high as 35% in areas with high erosion. For the RSHR in the four SWC benefits of group characteristics and the distribution ratio, respectively: SWC ability and soil erosion intensity are lower (group 1, 9%). There is a lower amount of soil and water storage and higher intensity of soil erosion (group 2, 19%). The amount of soil and water storage is large, and the intensity of soil erosion is low (group 3, 27%). Soil and water storage and soil erosion intensity are both high (group 4,13%). In a word, it is necessary to improve the proportion of SWC forest construction in river basins and intensive agricultural cultivation areas in national key SWC areas to enhance ecosystem service functions. This paper analyzes the pattern changes and benefit characteristics of SWCMs from a macro perspective, which provides a new perspective for the large-scale study of SWC in the future. This result in preventing soil erosion aims to make China's ecological civilization construction and ecological management more sustainable. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Black and biodegradable biochar/gutta percha composite films were developed by adding different contents of biochar (0, 2, 4, 6 and 8%, w/w) into the gutta percha matrix. The results showed that the biochar effectively improved the hydrophobicity and mechanical properties compared with the control film. Moreover, the biochar/gutta percha composite films showed high stretchability and barrier properties. In particular, the 2% BC film had the highest tensile strength (18.3 MPa) and elongation at break (280.4%) and the lowest water vapor permeability value (0.09 x 10(-9)g/m/h/Pa) at 34% relative humidity. However, the melting enthalpy (Delta H-m) and crystallinity decreased. In addition, these composite films exhibited little electromagnetic interference shielding with a reflection loss up to -1.79 dB at 8.2 GHz. Finally, the composite films were more biodegradable than PE film after 60 days in soil.

However, land management interventions aimed at controlling erosion in the region are hampered, mainly by a lack of watershed-based appropriate management practices and anticipated climate changes. This study examined the effectiveness of different land use changes and management scenarios in decreasing runoff and sediment loss under current and future climates in the drought-prone humid watershed of the Ethiopian highlands. We employed a modeling approach integrating observed data at watershed and plot scales with Soil and Water Assessment Tool. In the first step, we evaluated the impact of land use changes between 2006 and 2017 on runoff and sediment loss. Then, we developed five land use and management scenarios based on watershed land capabilities and selected land management practices. Model parameters were modified based on runoff and sediment loss results obtained from experimental plots of biophysical and agronomical land management practices in the watershed. The runoff and sediment loss were simulated under current (2014-2019) and future climates (the 2050s) for each land use and management scenario. Results revealed that land use changes (mainly an increase in Acacia decurrens plantations by 206%) alone between 2006 and 2017 reduced runoff by 31% and sediment loss by 45%. Under the current climate, the five land use and management scenarios reduced runoff by 71-95% and sediment loss by 75-96% compared to the baseline scenario. Under the future climate (2050s), these scenarios decreased runoff by 48-90% and sediment loss by 54-91%. However, their effectiveness was slightly decreased (5-23%) as a result of increases in rainfall (10-46%) and mean temperature (1.7-1.9 degrees C) in the 2050s. The scenario of improving vegetation cover through forage production and plantations in appropriate areas plus best land management practices was the most effective and climate-resilient of the five scenarios. This study suggests that evaluating the impact of land use and management practices under future climate change shows promise for guiding effective and sustainable interventions to adapt to climate change.

Methods: Continuous multiple-year simulations (31 years) with the HERMES model were used to spatially quantify N and water losses at county scale in order to identify best-practice management applications. Results: Results show simulated annual long-term N losses for the investigated Quzhou County, Hebei Province of 297 kg N ha(-1) under common farmers practice treatment (FP) and 102 kg N ha(-1) under optimized treatment including model derived N fertilizer recommendation and automated irrigation (OPTai). Total losses by N leaching, volatilization and denitrification were 57% (FP) and 40% (OPTai) of the applied fertilizer N, respectively. Spatial differences in N losses were found due to survey-specific differences of average N inputs among the townships. More than 260 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) of fertilizer input, N losses of 190 kg N ha(-1) y(-1), and around 116 mm y(-1) of irrigation water could be saved on average by optimized treatments compared to farmers practice. Conclusion: On clay loam soil only OPTai could maintain crop yield without drought stress.

Understanding the entire CLP's ecosystem carbon-water relationship and its response to the vegetation coverage increase and climate change is essential for the water resources management in this semi-humid to arid region. Water-use efficiency (WUE), defined as the ratio of gross primary productivity (GPP) over evapotranspiration (ET), is an important indicator linking carbon and water cycles at the ecosystem scale. In this study, the spatial and temporal variations in the ecosystem WUE were analyzed to investigate the responses of WUE variation to regional climate and vegetation coverage changes in the CLP using MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets of GPP and ET from 2000 to 2014. Results indicate that the spatial pattern of annual WUE was different from that of WUE over active growing season (AGS), generally with higher annual WUE but lower AGS-WUE for the semi-humid southeastern CLP areas. Significant increases were observed in annual and autumn WUE during the study period at both the per-pixel and spatial-average levels, while AGS-WUE, spring WUE, and summer WUE remained quite stable. Correlations between WUE trends and interannual variability of vegetation coverage (expressed as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index or NDVI), precipitation (P), and air temperature (T-a) showed that WUE trends were positively correlated with NDVI variation due to faster increases in GPP as compared to ET caused by enhanced NDVI. Precipitation variation was generally negatively correlated to WUE variation by contributing to faster increases in ET than GPP especially at different seasons. The positive correlations between interannual variability of WUE and T-a were subject to negative feedbacks between ET and T-a. Similar results were also found using net primary productivity (NPP) to calculate ecosystem annual WUE (i.e., NPP/ET). Our findings suggest that revegetation-induced vegetation coverage change rather than P and T-a changes is the primary cause for the increasing ecosystem annual WUE in the CLP. This study contributes to our enhanced understanding of the coupled carbon-water dynamics over regional terrestrial ecosystem under climate and vegetation coverage changes.

But these have not been investigated comprehensively in climate-sensitive regions. North Korea (NK) and its neighbours, South Korea and China, represent three economic levels that provide us with examples for examining climatic risk and quantifying the contribution of social resilience to rice production. Here our data-driven estimates show that climatic factors determined rice biomass changes in NK from 2000 to 2017, and climate extremes triggered reductions in production in 2000 and 2007. If no action is taken, NK will face a higher climatic risk (with continuous high-temperature heatwaves and precipitation extremes) by the 2080s under a high-emissions scenario, when rice biomass and production are expected to decrease by 20.2% and 14.4%, respectively, thereby potentially increasing hunger in NK. Social resilience (agricultural inputs and population development for South Korea; resource use for China) mitigated climate shocks in the past 20 years (2000-2019), even transforming adverse effects into benefits. However, this effect was not significant in NK. Moreover, the contribution of social resilience to food production in the undeveloped region (15.2%) was far below the contribution observed in the developed and developing regions (83.0% and 86.1%, respectively). These findings highlight the importance of social resilience to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on food security and human hunger and provide necessary quantitative information.

Analysis of Nutritional Quality Attributes and Their Inter-Relationship in Maize Inbred Lines for Sustainable Livelihood	SUSTAINABILITY												The present investigation was planned to understand the variability and inter-relationship among various nutritional quality attributes of maize kernels to identify potential donors of the respective traits for future hybridization programs. Sixty-three maize inbred lines were processed for the estimation of protein, starch, fat, sugar, 100-kernel weight, specific gravity, and moisture level of the grain. The results reveal that a wide variability among protein, starch, 100-kernel weight, specific gravity, and fat was seen, with special emphasis on the protein concentration that varied from 8.83 to 15.54%, starch (67.43-75.31%), and 100-kernel weight (9.14-36.11 gm). Factor analysis revealed that the protein concentration, starch, and 100-kernel weight, the three major components, comprise 68.58% of the kernel variability. Protein exhibited a significant negative correlation with starch and 100-kernel weight, indicating that an increase in the protein concentration will down-regulate the starch and 100-kernel weight. The inbred lines are proposed as donors for the development of high cultivars for their respective traits, viz., high protein (DMR WNC NY 403 and DMR WNC NY 404), high starch concentration (DMR WNC NY 2163, DMR WNC NY 2219, DMR WNC NY 2234, DMR WNC NY 2408, DMR WNC NY 2437, and DMR WNC NY 2466), high 100-kernel wt.

Genetic distance analysis revealed that DMR WNC NY 397 and DMR WNC NY 404 are the farthest apart inbred lines, having major differences in their protein, fat, starch, and sugar contents, followed by DMR WNC NY 2436 and DMR WNC NY 2394, DMR WNC NY 2212 and DMR WNC NY 2430, DMR WNC NY 396 and DMR WNC NY 2415, DMR WNC NY 404 and DMR WNC NY 2144, and DMR WNC NY403 and DMR WNC NY 2115. Moreover, this study proposes that these possible combinations of lines (in a breeding program) would result in genetic variability with simultaneous high values for the respective characteristics.					herlambang, susila/ADC-0479-2022; Langyan, Sapna/AAD-2571-2022; Sayyed, R Z/Q-4313-2016; El Enshasy, Hesham Ali/D-3733-2014	Langyan, Sapna/0000-0003-2826-1803; Sayyed, R Z/0000-0002-1553-1213; El Enshasy, Hesham Ali/0000-0002-9712-2033; herlambang, susila/0000-0001-5340-295X														2071-1050				JUN	2021	13	11							6137	10.3390/su13116137	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13116137													WOS:000660715400001

Here, we conducted a seven year N-addition experiment to comprehensively evaluate the effects of N deposition on P limitation, cycling, and use strategy in a subtropical Moso bamboo forest. N addition significantly increased foliar litterfall by 4.7%-21.7% and subsequent P return to the soil by 49.0%-70.1%. It also increased soil acidity, acid phosphatase activity, and soil microbial biomass P, which substantially contributed to a significantly increased soil P availability and largely alleviated the P limitation. This resulted in a significant decrease in the foliar P-resorption efficiency and the abundance and colonization of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Our results indicate that N deposition can reduce plant internal cycling while enhancing ecosystem-scale cycling of P in Moso bamboo forests. This suggests a shift in P use from a 'conservative consumption' strategy to a 'resource spending' strategy. Our findings shed new light on N deposition effects on P cycle processes and P use strategy at the ecosystem scale under increasing atmospheric N deposition.

The results revealed that during the study period, no changes in land cover type occurred in 7447.31 thousand km(2) of China, while the area of vegetation cover increased by 160.97 thousand km(2) in the rest of the country. Forest cover increased to 20.91%, which was mainly due to the conversion of large areas of savanna (345.19 thousand km(2)) and cropland (178.96 thousand km(2)) to forest. During the 12-year study period, the annual mean NPP of China was 2.70 PgC and increased by 0.25 PgC, from 2.50 to 2.75 PgC. Of this change, 0.21 PgC occurred in areas where there was no land cover change, while 0.04 PgC occurred in areas where there was land cover change. The contributions of forest and cropland to NPP exhibited increasing trends, while the contributions of shrubland and grassland to NPP decreased. Among these land cover types, the contributions of forest and cropland to the national NPP were the greatest, accounting for 40.97% and 27.95%, respectively, of the annual total NPP. There was no significant correlation between changes in forest area and changes in total annual NPP (R-2 < 0.1), while the correlation coefficient for changes in cropland area and total annual NPP was 0.48. Additionally, the area of cropland converted to other land cover types was negatively correlated with the changes in NPP, and the loss of cropland caused a reduction in the national NPP.

Its dominant fluxes, gross primary productivity (GPP), and respiration (in particular soil respiration, RS), are typically estimated from independent satellite-driven models and upscaled in situ measurements, respectively. We combine carbon-cycle flux estimates and partitioning coefficients to show that historical estimates of global GPP and RS are irreconcilable. When we estimate GPP based on RS measurements and some assumptions about RS:GPP ratios, we found the resulted global GPP values (bootstrap mean 149(-23)(+29) Pg C yr(-1)) are significantly higher than most GPP estimates reported in the literature (113(-18)(+18) Pg C yr(-1)). Similarly, historical GPP estimates imply a soil respiration flux (RsGPP, bootstrap mean of 68(-8)(+10) Pg C yr(-1)) statistically inconsistent with most published RS values (87(-8)(+9) Pg C yr(-1)), although recent, higher, GPP estimates are narrowing this gap. Furthermore, global RS:GPP ratios are inconsistent with spatial averages of this ratio calculated from individual sites as well as CMIP6 model results. This discrepancy has implications for our understanding of carbon turnover times and the terrestrial sensitivity to climate change. Future efforts should reconcile the discrepancies associated with calculations for GPP and Rs to improve estimates of the global carbon budget.

Some research thought that was feasible to install sensors in the greenhouse so that can obtain the input variables for predicting Timin. However, lots of expenditures would be spent for intensive greenhouse parks. Local weather data can be easily and economically obtained so that considered it as an input variable for predicting Timin. First, the Pearson correlation coefficients were used to select the relevant input meteorological variables and eight different input combinations were consequently constructed. Then, three generalized machine learning models (i.e. Random forest, RF; Support vector machine, SVM; and Multiple linear regression, MLR) and two deep learning models (i.e. Long-short term memory, LSTM; Gated recurrent unit, GRU) were used to predict Timin based on the eight different input combinations. The results showed that the RF and GRU model had the best prediction performance among the generalized machine learning and deep learning models, respectively. Deep learning models were not sensitive to the number of input variables. In the absence of sufficient meteorological factors as input variables, the GRU model generally had better prediction performance than the other models. The prediction ability of deep learning models was obviously superior to the generalized machine learning models when Timin > 28.5 degrees C or Timin < 13.9 degrees C, particularly for the GRU model. Most of the differences between predicted and observed value (Di) of deep learning models distributed between-1 degrees C and 1 degrees C. And most of the predicted Timin by RF, SVM and MLR models were lower than the actual Timin, while the deep learning models were relatively stable. Finally, consider the prediction accuracy in terms of lacking input variables and the stability of the model, we recommended deep learning models to predict Timin, especially the GRU model.

Miscanthus sacchariflorus and Miscanthus lutarioriparius were used as the parents to develop hybrids. We performed the transcriptome for 110 F1 hybrids of Miscanthus sacchariflorus x Miscanthus lutarioriparius and their parents that had been established on the Loess Plateau mine area, to estimate the population's genetic expression variation, and illuminate the adaptive mechanism of the F1 population. The result speculated that the F1 population has mainly inherited the stress response metabolic pathway of its female parent (M. sacchariflorus), which may be responsible for its higher environmental adaptability and biomass yield compared with male parents. Based on PopART, we assembled a leaf reference transcriptome for M. sacchariflorus (LRTMS) and obtained 8116 high-quality transcripts. When we analyze the differential expression of genes between F1 population and parent, 39 and 56 differentially expressed genes were screened out in the female parent and male parent, respectively. The enrichment analysis showed that pathways of carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and circadian rhythm-plant played a key role in resisting the harsh environment. The carbohydrate metabolism and lipid metabolism were also significantly enriched, and the synthesis of these substances facilitated the yield. The results provided an insight into breeding Miscanthus hybrids more suited to the harsh environment of the Loess Plateau.

Herein we selected two groups of wide and narrow slopes on the middle Loess Plateau, with each slope group including slopes with and without upslope runoff and sediment. For each slope, we collected soil samples from topsoil along the slope at different distances from the upper slope to the lower slope, and collected samples from depths of 0-60 cm at the upper, middle and lower positions of the slope. The contents of soil organic matter and nutrients were analysed. The purpose of this study was to disentangle the effects of upslope runoff and sediment on spatial distribution of soil nutrients on slopes of different widths. We showed that compared with slopes without upslope runoff and sediment, upslope runoff and sediment increased the content of most nutrients in topsoil on the wide slope, but had a contrasting effect on the narrow slope. Upslope runoff and sediment reduced the random spatial heterogeneity of soil nutrients on both the wide and narrow slopes, with greater effects observed on the narrow slope. The influence of upslope runoff and sediment on the profile distribution of soil nutrients varied with slope position and slope width, and was nutrient typedependent. These results indicated that slope topographical conditions interact with upslope runoff and sediment in influencing vertical and horizontal patterns of soil nutrients on slopes.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				DEC	2022	219								106588	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106588	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106588		AUG 2022											WOS:000863322300007

This study explores water-use characteristics of Robinia pseudoacacia during the transition period between the dry and rainy seasons in the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). A stable isotope technique (delta O-18 and delta D) and two complementary approaches (i.e., the direct inference method and the MixSIAR model) were used to distinguish water source changes during this transition period. Based on delta O-18 and delta D distribution patterns, we subdivided a 500 cm soil profile into four potential water sources: shallow (0-40 cm), intermediate-shallow (40-120 cm), intermediate (120-200 cm) and deep (200-500 cm). During the transition period, R. pseudoacacia exhibited different water uptake patterns. In April 26.2% and 48.4% of water uptake derived from the 40 to 120 and 200 to 500 cm soil profile layers; in May, 21.5%, 24.5% and 37.4% of water was absorbed from the 0 to 40, 40 to 120 and 200 to 500 cm soil profile layers. In June and July, 51.6% and 53.6% of the water mainly derived from the 0 to 120 cm soil profile layer, respectively. During the dry season (April), the trend in water uptake shifted to the deep soil layer, potentially a key period for the onset of soil desiccation in this soil layer. As precipitation increased, the proportion of water uptake from the shallow and intermediate-shallow soil layers increased. Because water-use pattern characteristics could provide important information on the development of the dried soil layer (DSL), the stable isotope technique could help reveal the water sources used by trees while also offering insight into water movement mechanisms of local ecosystems. Given its usefulness, the application of the stable isotope technique should be expanded in analyzing practical ecohydrological issues that occur in deep soils in the future.

Understanding the mechanisms of NO-involved stress alleviation is progressing; however, a quantitative description of the alleviative capacity of NO against heavy metal stress is still lacking. We combined the results of 86 studies using meta-analysis to statistically assess the responses of heavy metal-stressed plants to NO supply across several metal stresses and plant families. The results showed that plant biomass was consistently improved following NO supply to metal-stressed plants. NO played an important role in mitigating oxidative damage caused by heavy metal stress by significantly stimulating the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, NO supply consistently increased the Ca, Fe, and Mg contents in both leaves and roots. Plant tissues accumulated less heavy metals when exposed to heavy metal stress after NO addition. Additionally, the best concentration of SNP (an NO donor) for hydroponic culture is in the range of 75-150 mu M. We further confirmed that NO application can generally alleviate plant heavy metal stress and its action pathway. The results presented here can help guide future applications of NO as a plant growth regulator in agriculture and breeding plants for heavy metal stress tolerance.

The Qinghai-Tibetan plateau (QTP) is regarded as one of the remaining 'Green' places in the world. With the fast-developing intensive livestock production, sustainable and environmentally-friendly practices are required urgently on the QTP. In the current study, Tibetan sheep were supplemented with the root of Astragalus membranaceus (AMT) to reduce the use of chemical veterinary drugs and antibiotics, and to examine the effect on rumen bacteria, the antioxidant capacities and immunity indices of small intestinal mucosa and meat tissue, and the liver metabolome responses. Natural, non-toxic feed additives can potentially replace chemical medications and antibiotics that are offered sheep to improve performance. In the present study, Tibetan sheep were supplemented with the root of Astragalus membranaceus (AMT), a traditional herb used widely in China. Twenty-four male Tibetan sheep (31 +/- 1.4 kg; 9-month-old) were assigned randomly to one of four levels of supplementary AMT: 0 g/kg (A(0)), 20 g/kg (A(20)), 50 g/kg (A(50)) and 80 g/kg (A(80)) dry matter intake (DMI). The A(50) and A(80) groups increased the diversity of rumen bacteria on d 14 and the relative abundances of fiber decomposing bacteria. Supplementary AMT upregulated the metabolism of vitamins, nucleotides, amino acids and glycan, and downregulated the metabolism of lipids and carbohydrates. In addition, supplementary AMT enriched rumen bacteria for drug resistance, and reduced bacteria incurring cell motility. In general, AMT supplementation increased the concentrations of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) in the small intestinal mucosa and CAT and SOD in meat tissue. The liver tissue metabolome response showed that AMT in the A(80) lambs compared to the A(0) lambs upregulated the metabolites for energy synthesis. It was concluded that supplementary A. membranaceus increased the relative abundances of fiber decomposing bacteria and improved the antioxidant capacities and immunity indices of small intestinal mucosa and meat tissue in Tibetan sheep.					xianju, wang/GWZ-6542-2022	Degen, Allan/0000-0003-4563-6195													2076-2615					NOV	2021	11	11							3236	10.3390/ani11113236	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani11113236								34827968					WOS:000806921200001

It is not practical to build a flume long enough to measure the STC in ephemeral gully through traditional soil erosion. Therefore, a methodology and a criteria were proposed to adjust the sediment feeding by regulating the length of main sediment supply section to achieve measurement of STC in ephemeral gully. The STC measurements were conducted under slope gradients of 5 degrees, 10 degrees, 15 degrees, and 20 degrees and unit-width flow rates of 5.33, 10.67, 21.33 and 42.67 m(3) s(-1) m(-1). The measured STC in ephemeral gullies ranged from 1.19 to 38.29 kg s(-1) m(-1) with high accuracy. Also, the measured STCs were positively and well correlated with unit-width flow rate and slope gradient. According to the values of Reynolds number and Froude number, the water flow in experimental ephemeral gully can be categorized as a turbulent and supercritical flow. A multivariate non-linear model was developed to predict the STC with slope gradients and unit-width flow rates, which performed well under experimental hydraulic conditions. The proposed methodology and measuring setup provide a new and reliable approach for measuring STC in ephemeral gully.

Yet, studies analyzing the specific effect of conservation agriculture practices on N2O emissions give contradictory results. Herein, we synthesized a comprehensive database on the three main conservation agriculture practices (cover crops, diversified crop rotations, and no-till and/or reduced tillage (NT/RT)) to elucidate the role of conservation practices on N2O emissions. Further, we used a random meta-forest approach to identify the most important predictors of the effects of these practices on soil N2O emissions. Averaged across all comparisons, NT/RT significantly decreased soil N2O emissions by 11% (95% CI: -19 to -1%) compared to conventional tillage. The reductions due to NT/RT were more commonly observed in humid climates and in soils with an initial carbon content < 20 g kg(-1). The implementation of cover crops and diversified crop rotations led to variable effects on soil N2O emissions. Cover crops were more likely to reduce soil N2O emissions at neutral soil pH, and in soils with intermediate carbon (similar to 20 g kg(-1)) and nitrogen (similar to 3 g kg(-1)) contents. Diversified crop rotations tended to increase soil N2O emissions in temperate regions and neutral to alkaline soils. Our results provide a comprehensive predictive framework to understand the conditions in which the adoption of various conservation agriculture practices can contribute to climate change mitigation. Combining these results with a similar mechanistic understanding of conservation agriculture impacts on ecosystem services and crop production will pave the way for a wider adoption globally of these management practices.					; Chen, Ji/A-6299-2018	Abalos, Diego/0000-0002-4189-5563; Chen, Ji/0000-0001-7026-6312													1774-0746	1773-0155				OCT	2023	43	5							63	10.1007/s13593-023-00911-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-023-00911-x													WOS:001063498800003

However, how vegetation presence affects N mineralization and its response to erosion has not been directly examined, hindering our ability to predict N cycling in eroding environments. Herein, we compared the effect of vegetation presence on N mineralization and mineral N dynamics in two growing seasons between erosion vs. deposition sites in three sub-watersheds in the transition zone between water erosion and wind erosion of North China. We aim to examine how soil N cycling responds to erosion and vegetation presence at temporal and spatial scales. The mineral N concentration in the soil solution and mineralization rates between May 2017 and October 2018 in plots with and without vegetation were measured to assess the effects of vegetation presence. We showed that N mineralization rates did not significantly vary among the three sub-watersheds or between erosion and deposition sites. The concentrations of mineral N in the soil solution were higher in relatively larger sub-watersheds for the erosion sites and in smaller sub-watersheds for the deposition sites. Vegetation decreased soil NO3--N and total mineral N and increased NH4+-N concentrations in the early and middle periods of the growing season. The effects of vegetation presence on net N mineralization rates varied with size of sub-watersheds, with increased rates of net nitrification and mineralization at both deposition and erosion sites in relatively larger sub-watershed, but reduced rates of net nitrification and mineralization in smaller sub-watersheds. Moreover, the presence of vegetation shifted the seasonal pattern of N mineralization. Therefore, vegetation presence had important ecological regulation on soil N cycling at spatial and temporal scales in the transition zone between water erosion and wind erosion.

Due to the widely occurred patchy vegetation cover and water-limited environment, regulation of vegetation cover pattern on runoff and soil erosion in arid and semiarid environment was addressed widely. In tropical and subtropical environment, patchy vegetation cover pattern also widely occurred in human-dominated landscapes. However, the effect of vegetation cover pattern on runoff generation and sediment yield and its dependence on rainfall characteristics attract little attention, and are unclear. Correspondingly, this study addresses two relevant issues: (1) the rainfall-dependent capacity of vegetation cover pattern to mitigate runoff and soil erosion; (2) rainfall-runoff and rainfall-erosion regimes mitigated by vegetation cover pattern. Eighteen 10 m-by-5 m plots were constructed for the three-year (2015-2017) observation in a humid and red-soil-covered environment in southern China. The results show that vegetation cover pattern affected the response of runoff generation and soil erosion to rainfall. The soil loss was more readily to be regulated by the fraction and spatial pattern of vegetation cover than runoff; the potential of the fraction of vegetation cover in regulating soil loss positively response to rainfall depth and rainfall intensity; and rising rainfall depth led to a weakened relationship between vegetation coverage and runoff volume. Our results illustrated that the increased rainfall intensity promotes the regression relationship between vegetation coverage and runoff volume. In this humid environment, vegetation cover pattern regulates the response of runoff and sediment discharge to rainfall characteristics; and the effectiveness of vegetation cover pattern on regulation runoff and sediment discharge was rainfall-dependent. This study indicates that including connectivity parameters in quantifying the spatial pattern of vegetation may lead to different understanding of the effectiveness of vegetation cover on hydrology and soil erosion.

Due to its significant beneficial effects on the crop yield and environment, DANF has been applied in many regions throughout the world. However, the effects of DANF on the crop yield, nitrogen apparent recovery (NAR), nitrogen uptake (NU), and farmland management strategies have not been comprehensively evaluated, and thus it is not possible to accurately determine and assess the optimal depth for nitrogen application in widespread use. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis based on 716 observations from 96 studies to examine the effects of three nitrogen application depths comprising 5-10 cm, 10-15 cm, and > 15 cm on the crop yield, NAR, and NU. The results showed that compared with the surface application of nitrogen fertilizer, under the three nitrogen application depths of 5-10 cm, 10-15 cm and > 15 cm, the crop yield increased significantly by 7.57%, 11.63%, and 11.85%, respectively, NAR increased by 46.37%, 55.27%, and 58.57%, and NU increased by 19.36%, 26.24%, and 20.93%. In general, a nitrogen application depth of 10-15 cm was most effective. Further analysis showed that the positive effects of DANF on the crop yield, NAR, and NU were influenced by climate factors, soil physical and chemical factors, and management factors. Mean annual precipitation > 800 mm and mean annual temperature > 15 degrees C were most conducive to improving the crop yield under different nitrogen application depths. In addition, we found that DANF was more effective in fields with poor soil and medium and low fertility. More importantly, DANF was highly adaptable to different crops. When DANF was applied in combination with slow-or controlled-release nitrogen fertilizer, the same or higher yields could be obtained at lower nitrogen application rates, thereby improving NAR and NU. These results provide novel insights into the optimal nitrogen application scheme for global agroecosystems by considering the climatic conditions, soil fertility, nitrogen application method, and nitrogen application rate at specific sites.																			0378-4290	1872-6852				MAY 1	2023	295								108895	10.1016/j.fcr.2023.108895	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2023.108895		MAR 2023											WOS:000957826900001

The purpose of this study was to examine runoff and soil loss responses under cropland (CL) and grazing land (GL) management practices in three climatic regions of the Ethiopian highlands: semi-arid (Mayleba), dry sub -humid (Gumara), and humid (Guder). We measured runoff and soil loss using runoff plots with and without soil and water conservation (SWC) measures (trenches, stone/soil bunds [embankments] with trenches on the upslope side, and exclosure) during the rainy season (July-September). The results revealed significant variation in runoff and soil loss amounts across land uses, SWC measures, and climatic regions. At Mayleba, seasonal runoff and soil loss in control plot were far higher from GL (280 mm, 26.5 t ha-1) than from CL (108 mm, 7.0 t ha-1) largely due to lack of protective vegetation cover and soil disruption because of intense grazing. In contrast, at Gumara and Guder, seasonal soil loss values were much higher from CL (21.4-71.2 t ha -1) than from GL (0.6-24.2 t ha -1) irrespective of runoff values. This was attributed to the excessive tillage/weeding operations involved in cultivation of teff (cereal crop) at Gumara and potato at Guder. Although SWC measures (practices) substantially reduced runoff and soil loss (decreased by 23%-86%) relative to control plot, seasonal soil loss under GL uses with trenches at Mayleba (12.6 t ha-1), CL with soil bunds and trenches at Gumara (22.1 t ha-1), and Guder (21.4 t ha-1) remained higher than the average tolerable soil loss rate (10 t ha- 1 year-1) proposed for the Ethiopian highlands. This suggests that SWC measures should be carefully designed and evaluated specific to land use and climatic conditions. Overall, the results of this study can help improve SWC planning in regions where land use and climate impact on soil erosion vary across geographical areas, as they do in Ethiopia and anywhere else. However, further investigation is crucial with replication of measurements over years and lo-cations to provide more accurate information on land use, management and climate controls on hydrological and soil erosion processes.					; Haregeweyn, Nigussie/J-5616-2015; Tsunekawa, Atsushi/L-8526-2013; Fenta, Ayele A./P-1639-2016	POESEN, Jean/0000-0001-6218-8967; Sultan, Dagnenet/0000-0002-1449-924X; Haregeweyn, Nigussie/0000-0003-2920-8094; Tsunekawa, Atsushi/0000-0002-7690-0633; Fenta, Ayele A./0000-0002-8228-4048; Ebabu, Kindiye/0000-0002-1381-149X													0301-4797	1095-8630				JAN 15	2023	326		A						116707	10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.116707	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.116707		NOV 2022						36375436					WOS:000886983500003

Meeting the high food demands in areas affected by desertification is a major problem. This case study provided fundamental information to demonstrate the potential for utilizing the desertified land. The soybean trial was established in two sandy clay loam soils (desertified land) and one silty clay loam soil. Two types of biochar were applied as treatments. We aimed to investigate the response of soybean plants to soil structure, soil nutrient condition, and biochar amendment in the two types of soil. In addition, ridge regression was employed to model the plant growth indicators by soil structure, soil nutrients condition, soil water content, and biochar amendment. We conclude that (1) overall soil productivity in sandy clay loam soil is lower than in silty clay loam soil. The sandy clay loam soil may have high efficacy for crop production due to its higher harvest index. (2) Aggregate size 0.5-1 mm, 1-2 mm, and 2-3 mm indicated more important in plant biomass formation in silty clay loam soil. The low aggregate stability of sandy clay loam soil made the field more vulnerable to wind erosion in the semi-arid monsoon climate. (3) Cob biochar and wood biochar increased soybean shoot biomass by 48.7% and 45.0% in silty clay loam soil. (4) The higher N-fixing ability of nodules in sandy clay loam soil indicates an advantage to reduce the use of N-fertilizers in desertified areas. (5) Exponential polynomial regression ameliorated the accuracy of prediction of plant growth indicators in comparison to linear regression.

Future climate change impacts on mulched maize production in an arid irrigation area	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Future climate change (FCC) and water scarcity significantly affect agricultural production in arid areas. Plastic film mulching (PM) combined with large irrigation amounts is popular for agricultural production in these areas. Crop model is an important tool for studying FCC's effect on crop production and its countermeasures. In this study, after calibration and validation using measured values from a two-year field experiment, the SPACSYS (v 6.0) and modified DSSAT-CERES-Maize (v 4.7.0.0) models were used to evaluate the implementation of six management systems (three mulching measures: transparent film, black film, no film; two fertilization levels: high, low) and to optimize management measures under FCC. Both models well simulated maize's anthesis and maturity dates, the final aboveground biomass, yield, and topsoil soil water content (SWC) compared with the measured values. SPACSYS simulated the maize growth and SWC under nitrogen stress better than DSSAT. Total 27 global climate models (GCMs) were used to drive DSSAT and SPACSYS models with different irrigation schemes, including three irrigation amounts (I1, I2, I3) and four irrigation ratios (the proportion of total irrigation amount in different growing stages: T1, T2, T3, T4) to simulate crop phenology and yield under FCC in future decades (2040s and 2080s). Both models advanced the anthesis date (by 8.1-16.2 d in the 2040s and 12.8-20.3 d in the 2080s), maturity date (by 12.7-18.9 d in the 2040s and 19.1-24.8 d in the 2080s), and length of reproductive growth period (by 3.6-6.1 d in the 2040s and 5.8-11.0 d in the 2080s). The I1T1 scenario under transparent film mulching produced the highest yields (12.14-16.07% in the 2040s and 5.36-6.07% in the 2080s higher than the average). The I3T4 scenario maintained stable yields in the 2040s, decreasing by nearly 20% in the 2080s. Consequently, the I3T4 scenario could be the optimal management practice for balancing yield and irrigation for maize production in this arid area in the future decades.

Wheat straw and its biochar differently affect soil properties and field-based greenhouse gas emission in a Chernozemic soil	BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS												A 2-year field study was conducted to compare the effect of wheat straw, its biochar, and wheat straw plus biochar addition on soil fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O during the growing season, and soil properties and crop yield in a Black Chernozemic soil planted to barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) in central Alberta, Canada. The objective was to assess the benefit of applying biochar instead of its feedstock, wheat straw, in improving environmental sustainability. Biochar addition did not affect soil CH4 oxidation, but decreased CO2 and N2O emissions as compared with both wheat straw applied alone and wheat straw and biochar applied together in 2010 and 2011 (p < 0.001), and resulted in a lower global warming potential, indicating that the biochar was effective in mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from the agricultural soil, as a result of biochar suppressing soil microbial activity and reducing soil N availability. Biochar application reduced N2O emission over 2 years, indicating its longer-term impact. Biochar application alone increased barley yield by 9.9 to 20.4% as compared to the other three treatments, thus reducing yield-scaled greenhouse gas emission intensity by 27.2 to 50.9% (p = 0.013 for the control and p < 0.001 for both wheat straw-amended treatments), with an average reduction of 3.43 t CO2-eq t(-1) grain. The application of both wheat straw and its biochar reduced the temperature sensitivity of soil CO2 emission (Q(10), p < 0.001), but the application of wheat straw or its biochar alone did not affect Q(10), indicating that biochar application reduces the sensitivity to temperature changes of the decomposition of the new organic matter added to the soil. We conclude that (1) the application of wheat straw-derived biochar was preferred to raw wheat straw in mitigating GHG emission and (2) biochar can be an effective management strategy for properly handling crop residues in sustainable agriculture.

The major landscape in the hilly-gully region of the Loess Plateau is greatly affected by vegetation rehabilitation on abandoned cropland. Although many studies have shown that the rehabilitation have greatly improved soil conditions and protected them from erosion, these effectiveness were not always in consensus possibly due to the land type of vegetation or to the rehabilitation time. To close this gap, we conducted a long term experiment as follows. Methods. In this study, we analysed four land types of vegetation rehabilitation (shrub land, woodland, naturally revegetated grassland, and orchard land) with different rehabilitation times and investigated the mechanical composition and erodibility of the soil. Areas of slope croplandand natural forest were selected as controls. Results. The results showed that soil depth, rehabilitation time and rehabilitation land type had strong impacts on soil mechanical composition, micro-aggregation and erodibility. Following rehabilitation, naturally revegetated grassland and shrub land had lower fractal dimensions of particle size distribution (fractal dimensions of PSD), fractal dimensions of micro-aggregation, and erodibility (K factor) than did cropland. Compared to the positive effects of rehabilitation mainly happened in the topsoil layer at other rehabilitation land type, that of woodland happened in the deeper soil layer. Besides, the indispensable rehabilitation time for the significant improvement of soil condition was shorter at naturally revegetated grassland than that at shrub land and woodland. Discussion. Although rehabilitation time was more influential than was rehabilitation land type or soil depth, the differences among the rehabilitation land types showed that naturally revegetated grassland with native plants is the most time-saving rehabilitation vegetation for the Loess Plateau in the conversion from slope cropland. The success of rehabilitation in this forestry practice was mainly contributed by the suited species of rehabilitation land type to the local climate and soil. Based on the differences of rehabilitation effectiveness resulting from land type, we should be cautious to choose land types for the rehabilitation of soil conditions in the Loess Plateau.

Lake debris and meltwater samples were collected from the supraglacial lake to determine bacterial diversity. Geochemical analyses of samples showed free amino acids (FAAs), anions, cations, and heavy metals. Comparable viable bacterial counts were observed in meltwater and debris samples. Using R(2)A media, a total of 52 bacterial isolates were identified: 40 from debris and 12 from meltwater. The relative abundance of Gram-positive (80.8%) bacteria was greater than Gram-negative (19.2%). Molecular identification of these isolates revealed that meltwater was dominated by Firmicutes (41.6%) and Proteobacteria (41.6%), while lake debris was dominated by Firmicutes (65.0%). The isolates belonged to 14 genera with the greatest relative abundance in Bacillus. Tolerance level of isolates to salts was high. Most of the Gram-positive bacteria were eurypsychrophiles, while most of the Gram-negative bacteria were stenopsychrophiles. Gram-negative bacteria displayed a higher minimum inhibitory concentration of selected heavy metals and antibiotics than Gram-positive. This first-ever study of culturable bacteria from a freshly formed supraglacial lake improves our understanding of the bacterial diversity and antibiotic resistance released from the glaciers as a result of GLOF.

Among the recent breakthroughs is the identification and utilization of a three-phase (donor-mixed-acceptor) BHJ, where the (intermediate) mixed phase can inhibit mesoscale morphological changes, such as phase separation. Using a mean-field approach, we reveal and distinguish between generic mechanisms that alter, through transverse instabilities, the evolution of stripes: the bending (zigzag mode) and the pinching (cross-roll mode) of the donor-acceptor domains. The results are summarized in a parameter plane spanned by the mixing energy and illumination, and show that donor-acceptor mixtures with higher mixing energy are more likely to develop pinching under charge-flux boundary conditions. The latter is notorious as it leads to the formation of disconnected domains and hence to loss of charge flux. We believe that these results provide a qualitative road map for BHJ optimization, using mixed-phase composition and, therefore, an essential step toward long-lasting OPV. More broadly, the results are also of relevance to study the coexistence of multiple-phase domains in material science, such as in ion-intercalated rechargeable batteries.

Effects of spatial variation in water quality and hydrological factors on environmental flows	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Environmental flow is the quantity, timing, and quality of water flows required to sustain freshwater and estuarine ecosystems and the human livelihoods and well-being that depend on these ecosystems. Environmental flows (e-flows) are crucial parameters for ecosystem restoration. Understanding the effects of spatial variation in the hydrological and water quality factors on e-flows aids the determination of recovery prior areas and helps to improve the success rate of ecosystem restoration projects. However, few studies have investigated the effects, which severely hinder the restoration of aquatic ecosystems and the sustainable use of water resources in inland waters. This paper therefore presents a framework for studying such effects. Spatial autocorrelation, a geostatistical method, is used to analyze the spatial variation in the hydrological and water quality factors and to further analyze the effects of various factors on the spatial heterogeneity of e-flows. Four different methods including the Tennant method, wetted perimeter method, AEHRA, and integrated water quality method are integrated to comprehensively evaluate e-flows. The former three methods consider the demands of biota on the streamflow, whereas the latter considers the demands on both the streamflow and the water quality. The results show that the Tennant and wetted perimeter methods, which focus on the statistics of only streamflow, result in similar spatial distribution of e-flows; the AEHRA and integrated water quality method, which consider the effects of water quality and other hydrological factors such as flow velocity and water depth on fish, also result in a similar spatial variation. Consideration of both demands on the hydrological factors and the water quality environmental factors makes the integrated water quality method more practical, particularly in developing regions with excessive pollutant discharge into rivers. In addition, spatial variation in the hydrological and water quality factors influenced the presence of principal fish species and consequently affected the e-flows. Of the 37 water quality factors identified, water transparency had a negative impact on e-flow because the increase in transparency could reduce the number of principal fish species. Of the four hydrological factors, flow velocity and river width had positive impacts on fish because the increase in flow velocity can provide breeding sites and habitats for more fish, respectively, both of which result in increases in the numbers of principal fish species. We found that spatial variation in the hydrology and water quality factors had a profound impact on the living environments of aquatic organisms; negative changes in these factors lowered the survival probability of principal species, which changed the hierarchy and structure of the ecosystems and thus led to variation in e-flows. The results can provide priori knowledge for e-flow methods selection and a reference for ecosystem restoration helping improve the success rate of project elsewhere in the world.

Methods We identified 57 relevant papers about grazing on the Tibetan Plateau, from which 366 data sets suitable for the meta-analysis were extracted. Effect sizes were assessed by computing natural log-converted response ratios of response variables. Percentage change relative to control was used for each estimate of grazing effects. Results The aboveground biomass, soil water content (SWC), soil organic carbon, soil total nitrogen, and soil total phosphorus significantly decreased with increased grazing intensities, while plant species richness (SR), soil bulk density (SBD) and the ratio of root to shoot exhibited the opposite tendency. Belowground biomass (BGB) showed no significant differences under light and high grazing intensities while apparently increased under moderate grazing intensity (MG) that verifies the biomass transfer hypothesis. BGB was positively related to SBD and SR but was negatively associated with SWC. Conclusions The biomass transfer in MG supports the optimal partitioning hypothesis that plants partition biomass among various organs to maximize growth rate responding to environmental stress. The findings suggest that the primary mechanisms leading to the enhancement of BGB in MG are compensatory growth of individual plants, a dwarfing tendency within the plant community, a significant increase in species richness, and changes in soil microbial communities resulting from grazing.

Rill erosion, as the initial stage of channel erosion, accounts for > 80% of total eroded sediments on sloping fanning lands in many parts of the world. Previous researches often regard rill erosion as an entirety or focus on individual rill erosion process separately. Few attentions have been paid to the contributions of individual processes including nil headcut advance, bed incision, sidewall expansion and their interactions to the over-all rill erosion. Thus, simulated upslope inflow experiments were designed to investigate the impacts of individual processes involved and their interactions in rill erosion under four inflow rates (1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 L min(-1)) and two slope gradients (15 degrees and 20 degrees). Photogrammetry and manual sampling were used to measure hillslope morphology variation and sediment delivery, repectively. The results show that headcut advance, bed incision and sidewall expansion interact with each other and exhibit both independent and dependent features across spatial and temporal scales. Headcut advance interacts with bed incision and sidewall expansion before rill head advancing to a critical slope length. Initial rill depth and width are determined by initial headcut morphology. Bed incision and sidewall expansion dominate rill erosion before and after the non-erodible layer is exposed to concentrated flow, respectively. Headcut advance contributed the largest amount of rill erosion (44%-68%), followed by bed incision (27%-44%) and sidewall expansion (3.8%-12%). Headcut advance contributed more (63%-83%) to total rill width increment while bed incision contributed larger percentage (51%-65%) to total rill depth increment. Prediction equations for length, width and depth of a single rill on a loessial hillslope and empirical equations of rill erosion for the individual erosion processes were fitted and validated. Quantification and understanding of the contributions of individual rill erosion processes provides the necessary scientific basis for the development of process-based rill erosion models, and then, for preventions of soil losses and land degradation.

Through interviews with farmers and field inventories, 107 IFTS species were identified as ruminant feeds, from which 37 potential IFTS species were selected. The chemical composition and anti-nutritional factors of the selected IFTS were analysed. Among the 37 selected IFTS species, crude protein (CP) ranged from 83.3 to 230.5 (mean, 134.3) g kg(-1 )dry matter (DM); CP was greater than 80 g kg(-1) DM in all selected species. Condensed tannin (CT) content varied from 2.57 to 210.91 g kg(-1) (p < 0.05) among the selected species, of which 72% had < 40 g kg(-1) DM, an amount that is tolerable for ruminants. Farmers' preferences and the nutritive value of the selected fodder species were positively correlated (p < 0.05) for CP (0.61), organic matter digestibility (0.303) and metabolisable energy (0.25). Farmers' preference ranking and the nutritive value of the plants were considered to select the top 14 IFTS, all of which had CP > 110 g kg(-1), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) < 350 g kg(-1), and CT < 40 g kg(-1). Thus, the selected potential IFTS need further evaluation for their agronomic practice, biomass production and animal performance.

Yet, surprisingly few studies have investigated the effects of mulching film upon soil microbial diversity and community structure. In this research, two kinds of mulching film, a traditional PE (polyethylene) mulching film and a degradable PBAT ((Poly [butyleneadipate-co-terephthalate])) mulching film, were applied to cotton (Gossypium spp.) plants grown in Xinjiang Province, China. The respective influence of the two mulching films on the cotton's soil microbial (bacteria and fungi) diversity and community were investigated. The results showed that applying the PBAT mulching film could significantly alter the diversity of non-rhizosphere soil fungi when compared to using the PE mulching film. However, neither the PE nor PBAT mulching film had any significant influence on the diversity of soil bacteria and rhizosphere soil fungi. Nevertheless, soil microbial community composition differed under the PBAT mulching film treatment vis-a-vis the PE mulching film treatment. The abundance of Gibellulopsis was higher under the PBAT than PE mulching film treatment. Our study's findings provided an empirical basis for the further application of degradable PBAT mulching film for the sustainable development of cotton crops.

Lateral overland inflow creates tributaries to the main EG channel for runoff and sediment discharge which exacerbates the EG erosion and local soil degradation. However, research concerning tributary formation by overland flow, especially contributions of overland upslope and lateral inflows to EG erosion, are still lacking. Thus, simulated rainfall and inflow experiments under two erosive rainfall intensities (50 and 100 mm h(-1)) and two typical slope gradients (15 degrees and 20 degrees) were conducted under representative lateral and upslope overland inflow conditions using an 8-m long, 2-m wide and 0.6-m deep soil pan. The results showed that upslope and lateral inflow both contributed to the runoff connectivity of the EG channel and lateral rills in the EG system. For these simulated conditions, upslope inflow contributions to total runoff and soil loss were 62-78% and 65-81%, respectively, while lateral inflow only contributed around 10%. The contribution differences could be attributed to flow hydrodynamic characteristics in that shear stress and stream power in the EG channel were 4.9-8.6 times greater than those on the lateral slopes. Lateral inflow was important to lateral rill formation, which contributed to imbricated landform and lateral gradient formation process, and consequently promoted runoff and sediment connectivity of the EG system. Soil erosion induced by concentrated flow in channels and sheet flow in interill areas coarsened soil textures, soil particles lager than 0.02 min increased 12.6% on average, which may contribute to reduction of local soil productivity. This work demonstrates the critical need of preventing both upslope and lateral drainage into EG channels.

However, few study was made on studying the effects of ant-burrowing activities on soil erosion previously. This study quantified the impacts of ant (Camponottis japonicus)-burrowing activities on runoff and soil erosion rates. Simulated laboratory rainfall experiments were undertaken on six soil tanks filled with clay-loam soil classified as a cumulic anthrosol, three of which introduced with ant colonies for two days and the other three were without ant colonies, under 40, 80, and 120 mm h(-1) of rainfall intensities and a slope of 15 degrees. Results showed that ants made mounds with a bulk density of 0.75 g cm(-3), which was lower than that of the soil matrix, i.e. 1.34 g cm(-3). Soil erosion rates for the tanks with ants were 6.78, 36.90, and 62.00 g m(-2) min(-1) under three rainfall intensities of 40, 80, and 120 mm h(-1), which were much higher than those of 3.94, 23.49, and 44.48 g m(-2) min(-1) for the tanks without ants. Ant nests reduced the runoff rate by 31%, 20% and 13% compared with those without ants and enhanced the soil water storage within 90 cm depth. Ant nests played a positive role in soil water conservation due to the large nest entrance diameter and the continuous macropore network. However, the ant mounds provided a loose erodible material and changed micro-topography of the slope surface, thereby accelerating the rill formation and exacerbating soil erosion. This study can help understand the effects of burrowing insects on soil erosion, which is an important environmental problem on the Loess Plateau.

The Gully Land Consolidation project (GLC) was implemented in 2011 on the Chinese Loess Plateau and it may influence the spatial distribution and temporal variability of SWS at the watershed scale. However, there have been limited studies assessing the magnitude and pattern of such changes. We measured SWS to a depth of 5 m nine times over four seasons across two watersheds- one treated by the GLC project (GT-T, n = 89) and the other untreated (GT-U, n = 72). We then used correlation analysis, principle component analysis, multiple linear regression analysis, generalized linear model, and regression kriging to evaluate the seasonal variability, as well as spatial patterns, of SWS. Mean SWS in the spring, summer, autumn, and winter ranged from 830 to 934 mm in the GT-T watershed and from 681 to 771 mm in the GT-U watershed. Land use was the most important factor for predicting SWS in the two watersheds. After land management as a result of the GLC project, SWS exhibited different spatial patterns in the GT-T watershed compared with the GT-U watershed. Dynamics of SWS between adjacent seasons in the GT-U watershed displayed more variability than that in the GT-T watershed. In both watersheds, soil water volume (SWV, i.e., SWS per unit area x watershed area) declined from spring to summer (-3.9% in the GT-T and -13.4% in the GT-U), and increased from summer to autumn (11.7% in the GT-T and 20.7% in the GT-U). After the whole year, SWV displayed different degrees of increase in the two watersheds (10.6% in the GT-T, 2.7% in the GT-U) due to the effect of land restoration. The ratios of SWV in the gully land filled in the GT-T watershed to the SWV of the whole GT-T watershed for the four seasons ranged from 21.4-23.3%, with a mean value of 22%. Our results provide new insights regarding how human engineering of landscapes (as exemplified by GLC project) affect the spatial distribution of SWS and the dynamics of SWV storing capacity at the watershed scale.

However, how such region-specific scale effect varies with basin properties still remains poorly understood. This seriously limits the ability of runoff prediction in ungauged watersheds with different environments and the integrated management of watershed under climate change and land use/cover change. In this study, the scaling relationships of annual RC and its variations with basin properties were quantified based on annual precipitation and runoff data series in twenty-five sub-basins belonging to two large basins on the Loess Plateau, Northwest China. The scaling behavior of RC was found to be significant, and the mean annual RC range significantly decreased as basin size increase. And this decrease of mean annual RC was faster in areas with thin loess cover than that in areas with thick loess cover. Area thresholds, beyond which the mean RC was no longer sensitive to basin size change, were observed for the scaling behavior of annual RC and it was approximately 10,000 km(2) in thick loess areas and 25,000 km(2) in thin loess areas. This indicated that the effects of basin properties on RC scaling behavior was related with scales. Soil thickness might be one of the key basin properties that determined the scaling behavior. An exponential regression equation (R-2 = 0.71, p < 0.01) was built for the annual runoff (R) according to the corresponding geomorphic area (a(n)) and annual precipitation (P) for basins with multiple geomorphic types (n). The results imply that the basin properties not only control the form of the scaling relationships of annual RC but also limit its variations under different geomorphic conditions. These findings may help us assess and manage water resources at the basin scale more accurately.					wang, yanhui/HPG-3348-2023; xu, li/GNH-3667-2022														0022-1694	1879-2707				DEC	2020	591								125727	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125727	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125727													WOS:000599757800111

Slope and soil type affect the spatial distribution of erosion-deposition; however, little is known about where erosion and deposition occur specifically and how they interact with influencing factors. To address this issue, four rainfall simulation experiments were conducted in a 1m x 5m plot with varying slopes (i.e., 5 degrees, 10 degrees, 15 degrees, and 20 degrees) and simulated rainfall for 1 h at a rate of 60 mm h(-1). For the two soils, the runoff rate and sediment concentration were correlated with a similar temporal pattern. Runoff increased gradually and ultimately approached a steady state, and the sediment concentration decreased gradually and ultimately approached a steady state, which indicated that the erosion processes of the two soils were controlled by the detachment-limited condition. The sediment concentration and erosion rate were positively correlated with slope. However, the onset of runoff was delayed for AS soil, which also had a relatively high sediment concentration. The distribution range and area of deposition for the two soils were negatively correlated with the slope gradient, and the main deposition area occurred at the bottom of the plots. In contrast, the SD soil was more susceptible to deposition, and the deposition thickness was mainly concentrated within a 0-4 mm depth; this concentration was not observed for AS soil because of its high erosion intensity. Overall, this similarity also existed in the spatial variations of silt and fine sand contents in the soil surface. The silt and fine sand-sized particles were the primary eroded particle sizes; however, selective mechanisms of these two particle sizes were obviously different in the two soils. The results indicated that the erosion-deposition characteristics and the main eroded materials differed with varying erosion intensities and soil types. These findings are essential for a more comprehensive understanding of soil erosion mechanisms under conditions without rill formation.					ma, long/JHU-2289-2023; Wang, Yiping/IZQ-2052-2023; wang, yue/ISA-4119-2023; Wang, Xuezhen/IUN-6267-2023; wu, jun/ISB-8607-2023														0167-1987	1879-3444				OCT	2020	204								104714	10.1016/j.still.2020.104714	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2020.104714													WOS:000580938500013

Their status, especially in drought-prone landscapes, is associated mainly with the land-use type and topographic position. This study aimed to clarify the effect of land use and topographic position on SOC and TN stocks to further clarify the ecological processes occurring in the landscape. To analyze the status of SOC and TN, we collected 352 composite soil samples from three depths in the uppermost soil (0-50 cm) in four major land-use types (bushland, cropland, grazing land, and plantation) and three topographic positions (upper, middle, and lower) at three sites: Dibatie (lowland), Aba Gerima (midland), and Guder (highland). Both SOC and TN stocks varied significantly across the land uses, topographic positions, and agro-ecosystems. SOC and TN stocks were significantly higher in bushland (166.22 Mg ha(-1)) and grazing lands (13.11 Mg ha(-1)) at Guder. The lowest SOC and TN stocks were observed in cropland (25.97 and 2.14 Mg ha(-1)) at Aba Gerima, which was mainly attributed to frequent and unmanaged plowing and extensive biomass removal. Compared to other land uses, plantations exhibited lower SOC and TN stocks due to poor undergrowth and overexploitation for charcoal and firewood production. Each of the three sites showed distinct characteristics in both stocks, as indicated by variations in the C/N ratios (11-13 at Guder, 10-21 at Aba Gerima, and 15-18 at Dibatie). Overall, land use was shown to be an important factor influencing the SOC and TN stocks, both within and across agro-ecosystems, whereas the effect of topographic position was more pronounced across agro-ecosystems than within them. Specifically, Aba Gerima had lower SOC and TN stocks due to prolonged cultivation and unsustainable human activities, thus revealing the need for immediate land management interventions, particularly targeting croplands. In a heterogeneous environment such as the Upper Blue Nile basin, proper understanding of the interactions between land use and topographic position and their effect on SOC and TN stock is needed to design proper soil management practices.

EUPHYTICA												The genetic architecture of nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and its two component traits i.e. NUpE (N uptake efficiency) and NUtE (N utilization efficiency) was studied using a bi-parental RIL mapping population derived from a cross HUW468 (high NUE)/C306 (low NUE). The mapping population, two parental genotypes and three check genotypes were evaluated under four different N levels (0, 60, 120, and 180 kg/ha) over three years. A genetic map containing 456 SNP markers (2571.38 cM length) was used for QTL analysis. Thirty six main effect QTLs (17 QTLs for NUE, 13 NUpE and 6 QTLs for NUtE) distributed on 12 chromosomes (1B, 1D, 2A, 2B, 3A, 4B, 5A, 5B, 5D, 6A, 6D, and 7A) were identified at 2.52-9.27 LOD scores. Individual QTLs explained 6.65-22.89% phenotypic variation. Multi-traits QTLs (Mt-QTLs) and epistatic QTLs involving first-order epistatic (QTL x QTL) interactions were also discovered. Candidate genes (CGs, as many as 737) were mined from QTL regions which were mainly involved in metabolic process, cellular process and catalytic activity, etc.; differential expression was observed for 49 CGs in roots and 34 in shoots. The CGs encoded important transcription factors, transporters, etc. having a role in NUE. QTLs and CGs reported in this study enriched the available knowledge. Seven QTLs (including three Mt-QTLs) and QTLs involved in six epistatic interactions are recommended for MAS for improvement of NUE in wheat.

The wide contrast in soil texture and structure (e.g., density, soil aggregation) in agriculture topsoils (0-10 cm) makes it challenging for soil-gas diffusivity predictive models to make accurate predictions across different moisture conditions. This study characterized gas diffusivity and gas-phase tortuosity in soils sampled from managed pasture and cultivated sites in Sri Lanka at 0-10 cm depth, together with selected soil-gas diffusivity data from the literature. Soil-gas diffusivity was measured using a one-chamber diffusion apparatus using N-2 and O-2 as experimental gases. The measured diffusivity, together with literature data representing both intact and repacked soils, were tested against five existing widely known gas diffusivity predictive models. The tested models tended to mischaracterize the two-region behavior in some of the aggregated soils, suggesting the need of soil-specific diffusivity models to better describe gas diffusivity in agricultural soils. We suggested a new parametric two-region model, developed in line with literature-based models, to represent both unimodal and bimodal/two-region behavior of selected soils. The new model statistically outperformed the existing predictive models for both intact and repacked soils and, hence, demonstrated its applicability to better characterize site-specific greenhouse gas emissions under different soil water regimes.

J	Wu, L; Yen, H; Arnold, JG; Ma, XY				Wu, Lei; Yen, Haw; Arnold, Jeffrey G.; Ma, Xiaoyi			Is the correlation between hydro-environmental variables consistent with their own time variability degrees in a large-scale loessial watershed?	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Temporal scale is an important keyword in environmental hydrology but little information is available in the relationship between correlation and time variability degree of hydro-environmental variables at a watershed scale, which makes it difficult to design effective real-time management strategies. Here we take the Yanhe River Watershed as a study case to simulate and inventory the fractal characteristics of correlation and time variability degree of runoff, rainfall, and NH4+-N at different time scales, focusing on the long-term series of 1984-2012. (i) The coupled modeling framework based on SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool), statistics and fractal theory is a time series analysis method that is particularly suitable for the evaluation of long-range correlation of non-linear time series. The Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient (NSE), R-2 and PBIAS during the calibration and verification period proved the reliability and acceptability of the established SWAT model in modeling multi-time scale runoff and NH4+-N load in the upstream catchment of Ganguyi hydrological station. (ii) Runoffs at all time scales showed positive correlations with rainfall although the significant level had a certain time scale differences. More interestingly, the correlation between NH4+-N loss and runoff at different time scales was significantly higher than that of rainfall. (iii) Each hydro-environmental variable has different fractal and time variation characteristics at different time scales, and the correlation levels between different hydrological variables are not completely consistent with their own time variability degrees at different time scales. These findings point to a fundamental challenge in managing regions with leading infiltration-excess runoff and uneven nutrient loading because the meteorological and hydrological variables in these regions exhibit the strongest temporal variability, which will affect the effective allocation and implementation in management practices.

Background and Objectives: Vegetation restoration changes community structure and species composition in ecosystems, thus changing the physicochemical properties of soil. Soil aggregate is the most basic physical structure of the soil. Therefore, in order to understand dynamic changes in soil aggregate nutrients as vegetation restoration progresses, we set out to investigate the nutrient distribution and utilization in aggregates, and how enzymes respond to the nutrient changes in achieving a nutritional balance along successive stages of vegetation restoration. Materials and Methods: We collected and analyzed soil from plots representing six different stages of a vegetation restoration chronosequence (0, 30, 60, 100, 130, and 160 years) after farmland abandonment on the Loess Plateau, China. We investigated soil nutrient stoichiometry, GRSP, and enzyme stoichiometry in the different successional stages. Results: The results revealed that soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, enzyme activity, and GRSP increased with vegetation recovery age, but not total phosphorus, and not all enzymes reached their maximum in the climax forest community. The easily extractable GRSP/total GRSP ratio was the largest at the shrub community stage, indicating that glomalin degradation was the lowest at this stage. Ecological stoichiometry revealed N-limitation decreased and P-limitation increased with increasing vegetation restoration age. Soil enzymes had a significant impact on the GRSP production, directly and indirectly affecting nutrient metabolism balance. Conclusions: Further study of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to identify changes in their category and composition is needed for a better understanding of how soil enzymes affect their release of GRSP, in order to maintain a nutrient balance along successive stages of vegetation restoration.					chen, wenjing/IZE-8536-2023															1999-4907				SEP	2019	10	9							796	10.3390/f10090796	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f10090796													WOS:000487978700047

A total of 1069 samples were collected from cropland soils in the Baiyin District (Loess Plateau, Northwest China), a characteristically resource-based region to investigate the sources of arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), vanadium (V), and zinc (Zn). Source identification was analyzed by multiple methods including spatial deviation (SD), correlation analysis (CA), enrichment factor (EF), principal component analysis (PCA), geographic information system (GIS), and positive matrix factorization (PMF). The results showed the combined applications of PMF, GIS, and PCA were accurate, pragmatic, and effective for source apportionment. Three origins were identified and the contribution rates were calculated as follows: approximately 95% of As came from wastewater irrigation; 75, 88, 60, and 76% of Cr, Mn, Ni, and V were separately derived from natural origins; and 81,93, and 70% of Cu, Pb, and Zn originated from industrial sources, respectively. Natural origins, industrial sources, and wastewater irrigation were the three main contributors of heavy metals to cropland soils in this region. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Yet assessing the importance of different soil erosion processes during such events remains a critical challenge, especially due to a lack of field observations. Based on detailed field surveys and remote-sensing analyses, we therefore provide erosion budgets for three representative catchments in the Chinese Loess Plateau, following an exceptional rainstorm event (July 26, 2017; estimated return period: 200 years). Our results show that the associated catchment-scale erosion intensities were 2815 +/- 529 t km(-)(2) for rill erosion, 787 +/- 486 t km(-)(2) for gully erosion, 4433 +/- 657 t km(-)(2) for landsliding and 3927 +/- 1009 t km(-)(2) for the collapse of implemented soil and water conservation measures (SWCMs, specifically terraces and check-dams). Hence, landslides (37 +/- 4%) and SWCMs collapses (33 +/- 4%) were the most important sediment sources, followed by rill (24 +/- 3%) and gully erosion (7 +/- 4%). The lower contribution of gully erosion likely results from earlier vegetation restoration efforts. Overall, our results indicate that successful erosion control during extreme events strongly depends on integrative and robust catchment management strategies. Specifically, the spatial intersecting of forestland and grassland can play a large role, with reforestation on problematic slopes being an important strategy limiting rill and gully erosion. Sufficient consideration should be given to the planning and maintenance of terraces and check-dams. The latter should be constructed with good flood-release facilities, meanwhile many small-scale dams likely work better than a few large ones. Likewise, (unpaved) roads should receive attention as they can also be a significant runoff and sediment source.

Use of near-infrared spectroscopy for the classification of medicinal cannabis cultivars and the prediction of their cannabinoid and terpene contents	PHYTOCHEMISTRY												Cannabis sativa L. is used to treat a wide variety of medical conditions, in light of its beneficial pharmacological properties of its cannabinoids and terpenes. At present, the quantitative chemical analysis of these active compounds is achieved through the use of laborious, expensive, and time-consuming technologies, such as high-pressure liquid -chromatography-photodiode arrays, mass spectrometer detectors (HPLC-PDA or MS), or gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Hence, we aimed to develop a simple, accurate, fast, and cheap technique for the quantification of major cannabinoids and terpenes using Fourier transform near infra-red spectroscopy (FT-NIRS). FT-NIRS was coupled with multivariate classification and regression models, namely partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and partial least squares regression (PLS-R) models. The PLS-DA model yielded an absolute major class separation (high-THC, high-CBD, hybrid, and high-CBG) and perfect class prediction. Using only three latent variables (LVs), the cross-validation and prediction model errors indi-cated a low probability of over-fitting the data. In addition, the PLS-DA model enabled the classification of chemovars with genetic-chemical similarities. The classification of high-THCA chemovars was more sensitive and more specific than the classifications of the remaining chemovars. The prediction of cannabinoid and terpene concentrations by PLS-R yielded 11 robust models with high predictive capabilities (R2CV and R2pred > 0.8, RPD >2.5 and RPIQ >3, RMSECV/RMSEC ratio <1.2) and additional 15 models whose performance was acceptable for initial screening purposes (R2CV > 0.7 and R2pred < 0.8, RPD >2 and RPIQ <3, 1.2 < RMSECV/RMSEC ratio <2). Our results confirm that there is sufficient information in the FT-NIRS to develop cannabinoid and terpene prediction models and major-cultivar classification models.

To determine the effects of long-term warming on soil structure and erodibility in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (China), a 21-year field warming experiment was conducted, where the soil response to temperature changes was investigated for two vegetation types (shrubland and grassland). The measured parameters included the fractal dimension (D-v) of aggregates, mean weight diameter (MWD), geometric mean diameter (GMD), multifractal dimensions of particle size distribution [capacity dimension (D-0), information dimension (D-1), information dimension/capacity dimension ratio (Di/Do), and correlation dimension (D-2)], and soil erodibility value (K). The results show that warming significantly increases the erodibility of the topsoil (0-2 cm). Among them, the larger particles (0.2-2 mm aggregates, sand) decreased, the K factor, D-v, and multifractal dimension (D-0) increased, and the MWD and GMD of the soil aggregates decreased. Long-term warming affected the amounts of soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus. Furthermore, warming weakened microbial activity and led to a reduction in the aboveground biomass of plants. With increasing soil depth, the effect of warming on the erodibility of underlying soil (2-12 cm) gradually weakened. Warming exhibited different effects on the erodibility of the shrubland and grassland because of their different soil aggregates and particle size distributions. These results confirm that long-term warming has obvious soil layering effects on different soil depths. Soil properties, plants, and microorganisms respond to warming and have direct or indirect effects on soil emdibility. The results of this study provide important insights into changes in soil structure and emdibility at high altitudes, especially under global warming.					chen, wenjing/IZE-8536-2023; li, xiang/JCN-9316-2023; wang, wenjuan/JGD-0428-2023; li, bai/JNE-1502-2023														0016-7061	1872-6259				JAN 1	2022	405								115382	10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115382	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115382		SEP 2021											WOS:000703712100003

To date seasonal change of soil erosion and soil redistribution on long gentle hillslopes are not fully quantified due to the variable erosive forces in different seasons. A multi-tracer method using rare earth elements (REE) was employed to discriminate seasonal changes of soil erosion and its spatial distribution on a sloping farmland driven by snowmelt runoff, wind force and rainfall-runoff. A long-slope runoff plot with 5 m wide and 320 m long located in the typical Mollisol region of China was divided into eight segments, each of which was 40 m long and tagged with one of eight REE oxides. The spot method of a partial-area tagging scheme was employed and a grid-based layout was used for REE application. Results showed that annual soil erosion rate was 3251.0 t km(-2) for the whole runoff plot, in which snowmelt runoff erosion contributed 537.3 t km(-2), wind erosion 363.1 t km(-2) and rainfall-runoff erosion 2350.6 t km(-2). Surface runoff is the main external erosive force of hillslope soil erosion, accounting for 88.8% of the total annual soil loss. Furthermore, for the eight slope segments of the 320-m long hillslope, the sediment transport ratios of each slope segment caused by snowmelt runoff and rainfall-runoff erosion were more than 23.5% and 34.7%, respectively. The results will enrich the understanding of seasonal soil erosion on long hillslopes. (C) 2021 International Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation, China Water & Power Press.

The present research was performed to determine the effect of drought stress on several physiological and agro-morphological traits in 17 durum wheat genotypes under two conditions (control and drought) over two years. The results of analysis of variance indicated that the various durum wheat genotypes responded differently to drought stress. Drought stress significantly reduced the grain filling period, plant height, peduncle length, number of spikes per plot, number of grains per spike, thousand grains weight, grain yield, biomass, and harvest index in all genotypes compared to the control condition. The heatmap-based correlation analysis indicated that grain yield was positively and significantly associated with phenological characters (days to heading, days to physiological maturity, and grain filling period), as well as number of spikes per plant, biomass, and harvest index under drought conditions. The yield-based drought and susceptible indices revealed that stress tolerance index (STI), geometric mean productivity (GMP), mean productivity (MP), and harmonic mean (HM) were positively and significantly correlated with grain yields in both conditions. Based on the average of the sum of ranks across all indices and a three-dimensional plot, two genotypes (G9 and G12) along with the control variety (G1) were identified as the most tolerant genotypes. Among the investigated genotypes, the new breeding genotype G12 showed a high drought tolerance and yield performance under both conditions. Hence, this genotype can be a candidate for further multi-years and locations test as recommended for cultivation under rainfed conditions in arid and semi-arid regions.

For this purpose, the heading date (HD), maturity date (MD), and length of the reproductive growth period (LRGP) were detected from the remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI) data by a threshold-based method during the harvest year 2003 to 2018 across the North China Plain. The results show that there was high spatial heterogeneity of winter wheat phenology in pixel scale across the whole area, which could not be detected in previous site-based studies. The results also verified that climate warming could explain part of the change in the HD. However, for the LRGP, the potential impact of non-climate effects should be further investigated. This study presents the spatio-temporal changes both in winter wheat phenology and corresponding mean temperature and then analyzes their relationships in pixel scale. Additionally, this study further discusses the potential impact of non-climate effects on the LRGP.

(Pt), is a global wheat disease threatening wheat production. Dissecting how Pt effector proteins interact with wheat has great significance in understanding the pathogenicity mechanisms of Pt. In the study, the cDNA of Pt 13-5-72 interacting with susceptible cultivar Thatcher was used as template to amplify Pt13024 gene. The expression pattern and structure of Pt13024 were analyzed by qRT-PCR and online softwares. The secretion function of Pt13024 signal peptide was verified by the yeast system. Subcellular localization of Pt13024 was analyzed using transient expression on Nicotiana benthamiana. The verification that Pt13024 inhibited programmed cell death (PCD) was conducted on N. benthamiana and wheat. The deletion mutation of Pt13024 was used to identify the virulence function motif. The transient transformation of wheat mediated by the type III secretion system (TTSS) was used to analyze the activity of regulating the host defense response of Pt13024. Pt13024 gene silencing was performed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS). The results showed that Pt13024 was identified as an effector and localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus on the N. benthamiana. It can inhibit PCD induced by the Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX) from mice and infestans 1 (INF1) from Phytophthora infestans on N. benthamiana, and it can also inhibit PCD induced by DC3000 on wheat. The amino acids 22 to 41 at N-terminal of the Pt13024 are essential for the inhibition of programmed cell death (PCD) induced by BAX. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species and deposition of callose in near-isogenic line TcLr30, which is in Thatcher background with Lr30, induced by Pt13024 was higher than that in 41 wheat leaf rust-resistant near-isogenic lines (monogenic lines) with different resistance genes and Thatcher. Silencing of Pt13024 reduced the leaf rust resistance of Lr30 during the interaction between Pt and TcLr30. We can conclude that Pt13024 is avirulent to TcLr30 when Pt interacts with TcLr30. These findings lay the foundation for further investigations into the role of Pt effector proteins in pathogenesis and their regulatory mechanisms.

However, knowledge about the influences of soil moisture drought on WUE is still lacking. Therefore, this paper aims to quantify the lagged effect and impact of soil moisture drought on terrestrial ecosystem WUE from 1982 to 2018 using ERA5 and Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) datasets. Drought conditions are described by the soil moisture anomaly percentage index (SMAPI). The lagged effect of drought on WUE is measured by the month with the maximum significant correlation between SMAPI and WUE. The impact of drought on WUE is estimated through the relative change of WUE during drought and non-drought periods. The results showed that: (1) Drought had an approximately 4month lagged effect on WUE, which was observed in 70.87% of the global vegetated areas. The lagged effect of drought on WUE was a short period (1-4 months) for shrubland and sparse vegetation, middle and long periods (5-12 months) for forest. (2) When drought occurred, WUE decreased by 36.95% in the Tibetan Plateau and 24.93% in West Africa, while WUE in North Europe, Alaska/N.W. Canada, and West Asia increased by 14.64%, 8.83%, and 8.53%, respectively. The negative and positive impacts of drought on WUE in each vegetation type were commensurate. Our results provide useful information for understanding the response of ecosystem carbon and water cycles to drought..

The regulatory effects of biotic and abiotic factors on soil respiration under different land-use types	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Assessing the impacts of land use on soil respiration (Rs) and its temperature sensitivity (Q10) is of vital significance for understanding regional carbon cycles. In this study, the regulation of Rs and Q10 by soil biotic and abiotic factors under different land-use types, i.e., cropland, apple orchard, abandoned land, Coronilla varia grassland, and Robinia pseudoacacia woodland, were examined in the Luoyugou watershed on the Chinese Loess Plateau. We monitored Rs, soil temperature, and moisture in situ from July to December 2018 and evaluated soil microbial abundance, root biomass, carbon and nitrogen nutrient levels. The results showed that soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, available nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, and microbial biomass carbon decreased by the following order: grassland > woodland > abandoned land > cropland > orchard. The high amounts of plant residues and the low levels of human disturbance in grassland and woodland contributed to higher soil carbon and nitrogen nutrient levels in these land-use types than in cropland and orchard. Rs decreased from July to December, with soil temperature and moisture being the key explanatory factors. The mean Rs in grassland (3.68 mu mol m- 2 s- 1) and woodland (3.81 mu mol m- 2 s- 1) was significantly higher than that in cropland, orchard, and abandoned land. Q10 ranged from 1.77 to 5.87 across all land-use types, and orchard, abandoned land, grassland, and woodland had Q10 values 1.91, 1.37, 1.47, and 3.32 times higher, respectively, than the Q10 of cropland. The variable importance in the projection (VIP) values from the partial least squares regression model showed that soil temperature (VIP = 1.41), pH (VIP = 1.22), microbial biomass nitrogen (VIP = 1.13), microbial biomass carbon (VIP = 1.12), bacterial abundance (VIP = 1.12), available nitrogen (VIP = 1.01), and soil moisture (VIP = 1.01) were the most important predictors of Rs. Our study suggests that soil temperature and labile organic matter exert stronger impacts on Rs than do microbial abundance and root biomass. Our results contribute to a better understanding of ecosystem carbon cycles.

We studied the growth and physiological responses of alfalfa to soil P supply at different N levels. Methods Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) plants were grown in an alkaline soil supplied with different levels of P (0, 5, and 20 mg kg(-1)) as monopotassium phosphate, and N (50 and 100 mg kg(-1)) as ammonium nitrate. Results Plant biomass and P concentrations always showed positive responses to P addition but not to N addition, nodulation was inhibited by lower P supply and higher N supply. Roots released more phosphatase and carboxylates, mainly tartrate, into the rhizosheath at lower soil P supply and higher N supply. Roots always acidified the rhizosheath, but rhizosheath pH did not vary considerably among treatments. Conclusions This study demonstrates the release of tartrate as a major carboxylate as affected by soil P supply and N supply, and highlights the importance of investigating plant adaptive strategies for P acquisition from soil with different N availability for proper application of P and N fertilizers.

We used multisource data on soil water content (SWC) and vadose zone thickness, combined with a spatial interpolation method, to quantify the vadose zone water and further deduce the water resource composition in the CLP. Vadose zone water is approximately 3.1 x 10(12) m(3) (+/- 27.5%) in the CLP, 92.4% of which is stored in the deep vadose zone (>5 m and above the groundwater table). The water resources composition of the CLP comprises precipitation, river water, vadose zone water, and the saturated zone water (shallow groundwater), accounting for 2.1, 0.1, 42.1, and 55.7%, respectively. Although a large amount of water exists in the vadose zone, the SWCs in the upper (<5 m) and deep vadose zones are 47.4 and 65.3%, respectively, of the mean field capacity, both being at a low level. Our findings bridge the knowledge gaps on the deep vadose zone water and water resources composition in the CLP, providing the basis for decision-making on balancing revegetation and water resources conservation.

Today, however, yaks are also raised in feedlots; conse-quently, more information is needed in choosing optimal feeding regimes. This study examined the effects of substituting steam-flaked corn (SFC) for coarse ground corn (CGC) on average daily gain (ADG), in vitro true digestibility (IVTD), concentrations of ruminal volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and serum metabolites, and rumen bacterial diversity of growing yaks. Twenty-one, 2-year-old male yaks (138 +/- 37.3 kg) were divided randomly into 3 groups (n = 7 per group) and received a total mixed ration (TMR) for 143 days. The TMR contained 446 g corn per kg dry matter (DM), but the ratio of CGC: SFC differed among the three groups as: 1) 100:0 (SFC0), 2) 50:50 (SFC50), and 3) 0:100 (SFC100). To maintain conditions similar to the feedlots, the yaks were fed as a group and feed intake was recorded daily. The yaks were weighed on 6 occasions during the study and ADG was calculated for each yak from the regression equation of body weight (BW) on days of treatment. On the morning of d 144 before feed was offered, jugular vein blood was collected to measure the concentrations of serum metabolites, and rumen contents were collected to determine ruminal VFAs, fermentation parameters and bacterial diversity. The daily dry matter intake (DMI) averaged between 6.08 and 6.15 kg per yak for the three dietary treatments and the IVTD increased with an increase in SFC (P < 0.05). The ADG was higher (P < 0.05) by 13.2% (812 vs 717 g/d) in the SFC100 group than in the SFC0 group while the ratio of the average daily DMI per yak to the average ADG per yak was lowest numerically for the SFC100 group (7.51), followed by the SFC50 group (8.46) and then the SFC0 group (8.66). The serum concentrations of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), serum urea-N, and triglycerides (TG) decreased (P < 0.05) but of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and total cholesterol (TC) increased (P < 0.05) with an increasing proportion of dietary SFC. The greater serum concentration of LDH and lesser concentration of serum urea-N suggests that the SFC50 and SFC100 groups were proliferating cells at a faster rate and depositing more protein in muscle tissue than the SFC0 group, as the ADG increased with an increase in the level of dietary SFC. The ruminal concentrations of VFAs increased and of NH3-N decreased with an increase in the pro-portion of SFC. The rumen bacterial diversity did not differ among dietary groups; Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the dominant phyla and Prevotella and Succiniclasticum were the dominant genera in all dietary treatments. These results demonstrated that increasing the proportion of SFC could improve IVTD, ruminal concentration of VFAs, ADG and the group DMI to ADG ratio.																			0377-8401	1873-2216				FEB	2023	296								115553	10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2022.115553	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2022.115553		DEC 2022											WOS:000916497200001

We show that the band structure is strongly influenced by the diameter of the nanowire, while substantial variations in the formation energy are observed by changing the passivation species. We modeled an octane moiety absorption on the (111) and (110) surface of the silicon nanowire to address the effects on the electronic structure of the chlorinated and hydrogenated systems. We found that the moiety does not substantially affect the electronic properties of the investigated systems. Indeed, the states localized on the molecules are embedded into the valence and conduction bands, with no generation of intragap energy levels and moderated change in the band gap. Therefore, Si-C bonds can enhance protection of the hydrogenated and chlorinated nanowire surfaces against oxidation without substantial modification of the electronic properties. However, we calculated a significant charge transfer from the silicon nanowires to the octane moiety.

Small intestinal morphology and sugar transporters expression when consuming diets of different energy levels: comparison between Tibetan and small-tailed Han sheep	ANIMAL												Some non-structural carbohydrates, especially starch, escape ruminal fermentation, are converted into glucose, and are absorbed from the small intestine. This glucose provides an important source of energy, and its usage is more efficient than glucose from carbohydrates which are fermented as short chain fatty acids in the rumen and, subsequently, undergo hepatic gluconeogenesis. Tibetan sheep graze on the harsh Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) all year round and their carbohydrate and energy intakes fluctuate greatly with seasonal forage availability. Consequently, a high capacity to absorb glucose from the small intestine would be particularly beneficial for Tibetan sheep to allow them to cope with the inconsistent dietary intakes. This study examined how the small intestinal morphology and sugar transporters' expression of Tibetan and Small-tailed Han (Han) sheep respond to fluctuating energy intakes under the harsh conditions of the QTP. Han sheep graze on the QTP only in summer and are generally raised in feedlots. Twenty-four Tibetan sheep and 24 Han sheep, all wethers, were assigned randomly to four groups (n = 6 per breed/group), with each group offered a diet differing in digestible energy content: 8.21, 9.33, 10.45 and 11.57 MJ/kg DM. After 49 d, all sheep were slaughtered, tissues of the small intestine were collected, and measurements were made of the morphology and glucose transporters and the related regulation gene expressions. At intakes of low energy levels, Tibetan sheep had a greater villus surface area in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum and higher mRNA expression of sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1 in the duodenum and ileum (P < 0.05) than Han sheep. In the glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) mediated glucose absorption pathway, Tibetan sheep had higher GLUT2 and taste receptor family 1 member 2 and 3 mRNA expressions than Han sheep in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum (P < 0.05). We concluded that the differences between breeds indicated a greater glucose absorption capacity in the small intestine of Tibetan than Han sheep, which would confer an advantage to Tibetan over Han sheep to an inconsistent energy intake on the harsh QTP. These findings suggested that ruminants raised under harsh environmental conditions with highly fluctuating dietary intakes, as is often the case in grazing ruminants worldwide, are able to absorb glucose from the small intestine to a greater extent than ruminants raised under more moderate conditions.

AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Nitrogen (N) is one of the most common macronutrients applied to soil to promote crop productivity, but no more information can be found in the effect of different management practices on the surface pathways of N loss in the process of drying-rewetting alternation. In this study, the laboratory intermittent rainstorms were adopted to quantify the mechanism and implication of agricultural interventions on slope runoff N fractions. Results indicate that: (i) The threshold ranges of sediment yield rate under 0% and 3% biochar vegetated slopes are generally smaller than that of bare slope while 6% biochar is just the opposite, but all of them increased with increased rainfall intensity. Horizontal ridge and vegetation strips show good performance on reducing sediment and fixing N under 0?3% biochar application, but the sediment and N loss increased dramatically when the biochar application increased from 3% to 6%. (ii) N loss can be aggravated from P3 (conventional flat planting + 3% biochar) to H6 (horizontal ridge planting + 6% biochar) on 10? bare slope and 120 mm.h-1 heavy rainstorm due to the drying-wetting cycle and the redistribution of eroded soil particles, but N loss on 10? vegetated slopes experienced overall significant decreases because vegetation combined with horizontal ridge or appropriate biochar curtail erosion and retain sediment. (iii) The hydrological pathways transporting various N fractions vary with different management practices. e.g., the particulate fractions in H6 of vegetated slope is 90.29% while 44.88% in bare slope under 120 mm.h-1, indicating biochar in excessive application would increase the loss of particulate nutrients under heavy rainstorms even with vegetation and horizontal ridge. The results will be helpful to parameterize from a lower scale or disaggregate from a higher scale in the runoff nutrient management of agroecological systems of the Loess Plateau.

Tibetan sheep are better able to cope with low energy intake than Small-tailed Han sheep due to lower maintenance energy requirements and higher nutrient digestibilities	ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Tibetan sheep are indigenous to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and are well-adapted to and even thrive under the harsh alpine conditions. Small-tailed Han sheep were introduced to the plateau because of their high prolificacy and are maintained mainly in feedlots. Because of their different backgrounds, we hypothesised that Tibetan and Small-tailed Han sheep would differ in their utilization of energy intake and predicted that Tibetan sheep would cope better with low energy intake than Small-tailed Han sheep. To test this prediction, we determined nutrient digestibilities, energy requirements for maintenance and blood metabolite and hormone concentrations involved in energy metabolism in these breeds. Sheep of each breed (n = 24 of each, all wethers and 1.5 years of age) were distributed randomly into one of four groups and offered ad libitum diets of different digestible energy (DE) densities: 8.21, 9.33, 10.45 and 11.57 MJ DE/kg Dry matter (DM). Following 42 d of measuring feed intake, a 1-week digestion and metabolism experiment was done. DM intakes did not differ between breeds nor among treatments but, by design, DE intake increased linearly in both breeds as dietary energy level increased (P < 0.001). The average daily gain (ADG) was significantly greater in the Tibetan than Small-tailed Han sheep (P = 0.003) and increased linearly in both breeds (P < 0.001). In addition, from the regression analysis of ADG on DE intake, daily DE maintenance requirements were lower for Tibetan than for Small-tailed Han sheep (0.41 vs 0.50 MJ/BW0.75, P < 0.05). The DE and metabolizable energy (ME) digestibilities were higher in the Tibetan than Small-tailed Han sheep (P < 0.001) and increased linearly as the energy level increased in the diet (P < 0.001). At the lowest energy treatment, Tibetan sheep when compared with Small-tailed Han sheep, had: 1) higher serum glucose and glucagon, but lower insulin concentrations (P < 0.05), which indicated a higher capacity for gluconeogenesis and ability to regulate glucose metabolism; and 2) higher non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and lower very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and triglyceride (TG) concentrations (P < 0.05), which indicated a higher capacity for NEFA oxidation but lower ability for triglyceride (TG) synthesis. We concluded that our prediction was supported as these differences between breeds conferred an advantage for Tibetan over Small-tailed Han sheep to cope better with low energy diets.

However, sensitivity studies on palaeoclimate proxies under different geological periods and different climatic conditions are still lacking, which affects the accurate identification of palaeoclimate changes and the precision with which future climate change predictions can be made. Three soil profiles in Luochuan County were sampled, and the magnetic susceptibility (chi(lf)), frequency-dependent susceptibility (chi(fd%)), clay content (<0.005 mm), clay/coarse silt ratio, calcium carbonate content (CaCO3), and total content of organic carbon (TOC) of the profiles were analysed. The results showed that the climate changed from dry and cold to warm and wet to dry and cool since the end of the late Pleistocene. The precipitation (MAP) and temperature (MAT) since the end of the late Pleistocene were reconstructed by using the magnetic susceptibility of different soil particle size fractions (>2 mm, 2-1 mm, 1-0.5 mm, 0.5-0.25 mm, <0.25 mm), and the results were compared with those from other researchers. The results showed that the magnetic susceptibility of the fine fraction (<0.25 mm) was more sensitive at 0-3200 cal. yr. BP, 8500-13,000 cal. yr. BP, and 15,000-25,000 cal. yr. BP, while that of the coarse fraction (>0.25 mm) was more sensitive at 3200-8500 cal. yr. BP. Based on this finding, the precipitation and temperature of this period were reconstructed. This study provides a research method for selecting suitable climate proxies to describe climate changes in different geological periods to accurately conduct quantitative or semiquantitative assessments of climate change.

The response of SOC to climate change and its associated control processes are still not well understood at the national level due to limited surface monitoring and control experiments. With changes in vegetation growth and the regulation of its carbon input, the feedback of topsoil SOC to climate change is likely to become more complex at broad geographical scales. Here, on the basis of the long-term satellite remote sensing data from 2000 to 2019, multiple linear regression and pathway analyses were applied to the raster scale to investigate the importance of vegetation carbon input relative to climate change impacts on topsoil SOC in China and quantify the direct effects of climate change on topsoil SOC and the indirect effects through vegetation net primary productivity (NPP). The results show that the overall trend of increase in topsoil SOC in China from 2000 to 2019 is significant (P < 0.05), and most regions show a good development trend in the future, except for some areas in the Central South, East, and Northeast regions, where a risk of degradation exists. Relative to climate change, the dominant areas of NPP impact on topsoil SOC in China occupy a considerable proportion, especially in the North, Northwest, and Central South regions, with area proportions of 68.15 %, 49.52 %, and 47.99 %, respectively. The indirect positive impacts of climate change on changes in topsoil SOC in China through vegetation carbon input offset the direct negative impacts in most areas. These results have important implications for enhanced prediction of future SOC changes and provide references for terrestrial carbon sinks management strategies in the context of response to climate change.

In this study, three hybrid models (PSO-ELM, GA-ELM and ABC-ELM) integrating the extreme learning machine model (ELM) with three biological heuristic algorithms, i.e., PSO, GA and ABC, were proposed for predicting daily ET0 based on daily meteorological data from 2000 to 2019 at twelve representative stations in different climatic zones of China. The performances of the three hybrid ELM models were further compared with the standalone ELM model and three empirical models (Hargreaves, Priestley-Talor and Makkink models). The results showed that the hybrid ELM models (R-2 = 0.973-0.999) all performed better than the standalone ELM model (R-2 = 0.955-0.989) in four climatic regions in China. The estimation accuracy of the empirical models was relatively lower, with R-2 of 0.822-0.887 and RMSE of 0.381-1.951 mm/d. The R-2 values of PSO-ELM, GA-ELM and ABC-ELM models were 0.993, 0.986 and 0.981 and the RMSE values were 0.266 mm/d, 0.306 mm/d and 0.404 mm/d, respectively, indicating that the PSO-ELM model had the best performance. When setting T-max, T-min, and RH as the model inputs, the PSO-ELM model presented better performance in the temperate continental zone (TCZ), subtropical monsoon region (SMZ) and temperate monsoon zone (TMZ) climate zones, with R-2 of 0.892, 0866 and 0.870 and RMSE of 0.773 mm/d, 0.597 mm/d and 0.832 mm/d, respectively. The PSO-ELM model also performed in the mountain plateau region (MPZ) when only T-max and T-min, data were available, with R-2 of 0.808 and RMSE of 0.651 mm/d. All the three biological heuristic algorithms effectively improved the performance of the ELM model. Particularly, the PSO-ELM was recommended as a promising model realizing the high-precision estimation of daily ET0 with fewer meteorological parameters in different climatic zones of China.

A method is advanced in this study to measure soil matrix infiltration to verify its uniformity, before it was used to partition temporal preferential flow from the total infiltration employing two double-ring infiltrometers. A thin layer of fine sands were placed onto the nylon cloth in the inner ring and between the inner and outer rings of one double-ring infiltrometer to shelter the preferential paths and ensure that water infiltrates the soil matrix only. The other double-ring infiltrometer was directly inserted a shallow depth into soil to measure total infiltration at a nearby spot. Therefore, the difference of the total and the matrix infiltration is used to determine the preferential flow infiltration. Field experiments were conducted at five sites of a forested field in Tianshui Soil and Water Conservation Experimental Station, on the Loess Plateau, Gansu province of China. Experimental results indicated that the soil matrix infiltration processes at the five sites were roughly the same, thereby indicating that the matrix infiltration at one spot could be replaced by that of the nearby spot at the experimental site. The measured matrix infiltration can be used to partition the preferential infiltration from the total. The measured initial preferential flow infiltration rate (PIR) was 2.6-10.2 times of soil matrix infiltration rate (MIR) and the steady PIR was 2.3-4.9 times of that of the MIR. Preferential cumulative infiltration contributed 66-82% to total infiltration. These highlighted that preferential flow was a main part of forest soil infiltration at the experiment sites. This study provides a convenient method for fast determination of preferential flow infiltration in field conditions which is helpful for managing agricultural water resources and infiltration-related ecosystem service.					huang, xuan/AAH-9558-2019	Chen, Chao/0000-0002-2872-6407													0016-7061	1872-6259				AUG 1	2019	347						150	159		10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.03.026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.03.026													WOS:000468715000015

In the sub-optimal environment in Xishuangbanna, rubber trees undergo lengthy periods of defoliation and refoliation. The timing of refoliation from budburst to leaf aging could be affected by powdery mildew disease (Oidium heveae), which negatively impacts seed and latex production. Rubber trees are most susceptible to powdery mildew disease at the copper and leaf changing stages. Understanding and predicting leaf phenology of rubber trees are helpful to develop effective means of controlling the disease. This research investigated the effect of several meteorological factors on different leaf phenological stages in a sub-optimal environment for rubber cultivation in Jinghong, Yunnan in Southwest China. Partial least square regression was used to quantify the relationship between meteorological factors and recorded rubber phenologies from 2003 to 2011. Minimum temperature in December was found to be the critical factor for the leaf phenology development of rubber trees. Comparing the delayed effects of minimum temperature, the maximum temperature, diurnal temperature range, and sunshine hours were found to advancing leaf phenologies. A comparatively lower minimum temperature in December would facilitate the advancing of leaf phenologies of rubber trees. Higher levels of precipitation in February delayed the light green and the entire process of leaf aging. Delayed leaf phenology was found to be related to severe rubber powdery mildew disease. These results were used to build predictive models that could be applied to early warning systems of rubber powdery mildew disease.

Although previous studies have utilized crop potential distribution for crop planting strategies, they overlooked the high and stable crop-yielding areas within the potential distribution zone, which hinders the optimal utili-zation of these areas. Taking China as a case, this study proposed a high and stable yield index based on crop potential yield using a hybrid model at site scale (i.e., establishing the relationship between the observed crop yield and the outputs of process-based LPJ-GUESS model as well as climate variables using the random forest method) and assessed planting suitability of China's main grain crops (i.e., maize, wheat, and rice) under future climate change using the index. According to the results, (1) the determination coefficients between observed and modeled yield in the hybrid models were 0.71, 0.49, and 0.66 for maize, wheat, and rice, respectively, suggesting that the hybrid model had an acceptable performance. Moreover, the hybrid models had much better performance than the LPJ-GUESS model in crop yield simulation at site scale. (2) Compared with the 2001-2020, future average potential yield of three crops in the actual cultivated land would decline in 2081-2100, where the declined areas for maize, wheat, and rice would account for 83.8-89.2 %, 68.2-70.2 %, and 74.2-80.9 % of cultivated land, respectively. (3) High yield and stable yield areas of each crop do not overlap completely spatially, indicating that establishment of the high and stable yield index for crop planting suitability mea-surement is necessary. Compared with the 2001-2020, the optimal suitability areas of each crop will decrease under future climate change, implying that future climate change will reduce and shift the high and stable yield area of each crop. (4) Spatial overlay between the actual distribution and the optimal suitability area of each crop demonstrates that the optimal suitability area of each crop has not and will not be occupied completely by actual crop planting, suggesting a large available area for the adjustment of future crop planting area. This work could facilitate spatial optimization of crop planting to adapt to future climate change in China.																			0378-4290	1872-6852				OCT 15	2023	302								109112	10.1016/j.fcr.2023.109112	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2023.109112		SEP 2023											WOS:001071671400001

The relative importance that the surface runoff and interflow processes govern the nitrogen loss under extreme rainfall events, however, is ambiguous. Moreover, this ambiguity could be further enhanced by conservation practices on sloping farmland, such as straw returning and contour tillage. To better understand these ambiguities, five simulated rainfall experiments at the intensity of 100 mm h(-1) under four treatments including downslope tillage (DT), cross-slope tillage (CT), cross-slope tillage with whole straw returning (CT + WR), cross-slope tillage with crushed straw returning (CT + CR), were con-ducted in 2 years' maize season on a typical purple sloping farmland in the hilly area of Sichuan, China. Results showed: 1) Compared with DT, straw returning and cross-slope tillage significantly reduced surface runoff and nitrogen load of surface runoff. However the concomitant potential increase of the interflow runoff would result in the increase of nitrogen loss via interflow, offsetting the benefits of conservation practices; 2) The nitrogen loss through interflow is 6.38 +/- 0.21 kg ha(-1), accounting for 77.9 % of the total nitrogen loss and suggesting that interflow is the dominant process; 3) Dissolved organic nitrogen is one of the main nitrogen loss forms, accounted for 41.06 % (24.31-57.69 %) of the total nitrogen loss in surface runoff and 32.02 % (12.28-47.81 %) for interflow, should not been ignored; 4) The results of the three prediction models showed that the nitrogen loss caused by interflow drainage under extreme rainfall should not be ignored. These findings enhance our understanding of nitrogen exports induced by extreme rainfall events and provide references for nitrogen loss predictions and control in sloping farmland.

J	Zhao, YL; Wang, YQ; Zhang, XC				Zhao, Yali; Wang, Yunqiang; Zhang, Xingchang			Spatial and temporal variation in soil bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity and its influencing factors along a 500 km transect	CATENA												Soil bulk density (BD) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) are two critical soil physical parameters that affect soil water holding capacity, infiltration, carbon stocks, and many land and surface processes. Although variations in spatial and temporal BD and Ks are widely recognized and known to differ at different scales, little large-scale data is available. This study explores changes in spatial and temporal BD and Ks along a 500 km transect on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). On seven different occasions, we took BD and Ks measurements in undisturbed soil samples within the surface (0-10 cm) and subsurface (10-20 cm) soil layers from August 2015 to October 2018 along this long transect. This transect covers two climate zones (subhumid and semiarid) and mainly includes five land-use types. BD and log10-transformed Ks (LogKs) exhibited weak and moderate spatial variations during different sampling periods along the long transect, respectively. The highest LogKs values of the two soil layers were observed in summer. Only BD (LogKs) in the surface soil layer of semiarid zone was significantly higher (lower). Grassland had slightly lower BD and higher Ks compared to the other land-use types. Climate had no significant effect on BD and Ks variability. Land-use type and season separately had a significant impact on BD and Ks variability, while sampling time significantly influenced both BD and Ks variability. Ks was negatively correlated with soil water content in spring, summer and autumn. In this long transect, spatial and temporal variations in BD and Ks are determined by land-use types, seasonal changes, sampling time and soil water condition. Understanding temporal BD and Ks variations and their dominant factors will help in the selection of soil physical parameters to optimize hydrological models more accurately at a regional scale.

Amla (Phyllanthus emblica) fruit could be a good candidate to improve gut health due to its antimicrobial, gastro-protective, and immunomodulatory effects. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of amla fruit powder supplementation on frequency of diarrhea and growth performance of dairy calves. One hundred male Holstein calves [2-days (d)-old; 42.6 +/- 1.7 kg body weight (BW)] were randomly assigned into five treatments, CON, PEF5, PEF10, PEF20, and PEF40, with 0, 5, 10, 20, and 40 g/d amla fruit powder (PEF) supplementation, respectively, and housed in individual hutches (n = 20 calves per treatment). The experiment lasted from 2 to 75 d of age (weaning) and calves were fed milk (2-7 d), milk replacer (8-75 d), and calf starter (2-75 d). The PEF supplementations were fed in two meals a day, equal amount each time, by mixing into milk or milk replacer. Feed intake and fecal score data were collected daily; BW and body frame measurements at 2, 14, 28, 42, and 75 d; and rumen fluid samples at 14, 28, 42, and 75 d. Starter and total dry matter intakes (DMI) differed among treatments during 22-75 with the highest in CON and linearly decreased with increasing PEF doses. Liquid feed DMI tended to decrease with increasing PEF doses. PEF supplementation had quadratic effect on body weight (BW), average daily gain (ADG), feed efficiency, body length, heart girth, and withers height. The BW and ADG differed among treatments during 29-75 and 15-75 d, respectively, with the highest in PEF5 followed by CON and lowest in PEF40. However, PEF did not improve BW and ADG compared to the CON. The overall feed efficiency in PEF5 was higher than in PEF20 and PEF40. PEF5 decreased the frequency of fecal score "3" (P = 0.02) while PEF5 (P < 0.01) and PEF10 (P =0.03) increased the frequency of fecal score "1", compared to the CON. Frequency of diarrhea in the PEF5 group (7.9%) was lower (P < 0.05) than all groups (11.1%, 14.3%, 22.6%, and 24.2% for PEF10, PEF20, and PEF40, respectively). Rumen fermentation (pH, ammonia-N, and volatile fatty acids) was not affected by PEF supplementation. However, ammonia-N showed a decreasing trend with increasing PEF levels. The results suggested that PEF could be fed at 5 g/d to reduce diarrhea in preweaning dairy calves.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi have the potential to enhance nutrient uptake by crops and immo-bilization by soil particles, and improving soil structure, which together reduce overall nutrient losses from soils. Despite their importance, the mechanism(s) by which AM fungi ameliorate erosion-induced nutrient losses have not been reported. This understanding is urgently needed for management of nutrient in agricultural systems and for ecosystem sustainability. In this study, we conducted simulated erosion experiments to determine the effects of exogenous AM fungal inoculation (Glomus mosseae) on erosion-induced soil nutrient losses, and how such effects vary with erosion intensities (light vs heavy erosion) and cropping systems (maize vs soybean). We show that AM fungal inoculation decreased the total loss of nitrogen (N) (-18.4% and-14.1% in maize and soybean, respectively) and phosphorus (P) (-27.6% and-38.8% in maize and soybean, respectively) in runoff and sediment compared to control treatments. The positive effect of AM fungal inoculation on reducing soil nutrient losses was consistent with crop systems, it increased with erosion intensity. Some of the positive effect of AM fungal inoculation on nutrient losses was likely due to enhanced plant nutrient uptake (33.1-128.2%) and decreased runoff and sediment loss (3.4-49.7%). Taken together, these results demonstrate that AM fungal inoculation significantly reduced erosion-induced soil nutrient losses, and highlight the potential of using AM fungal inoc-ulation as a means to support sustainability of agriculture systems and other environments.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				JAN	2023	220		A						106687	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106687	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106687		OCT 2022											WOS:000877327800004
J	Wu, L; Liu, X; Yang, Z; Yu, Y; Ma, XY				Wu, Lei; Liu, Xia; Yang, Zhi; Yu, Yang; Ma, Xiaoyi			Effects of single- and multi-site calibration strategies on hydrological model performance and parameter sensitivity of large-scale semi-arid and semi-humid watersheds	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												In large-scale watersheds, only the calibration of parameters for the outlet may ignore spatial heterogeneity and fail to meet the simulation accuracy of local areas. Based on the runoff observation data of three hydrological stations (Qingyang, Yangjiaping and Zhangjiashan) in the Jinghe River Watershed, single- and multi-site calibration strategies were designed to investigate the performance and applicability of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in predicting the monthly runoff of nested catchments and evaluate the differences in parameter sensitivity between the upstream and downstream. (i) The two calibration strategies showed little difference in the simulation accuracy of the watershed outlet; the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and determination coefficient (R-2) were approximately 0.8 and 0.6, respectively, and the percentage of bias (PBIAS) was mostly <15%. The single-site one-by-one calibration was significantly better than the multi-site joint calibration at the interior points of the watershed. Among them, Qingyang decreased most obviously in the joint calibration with Zhangjiashan, with both NSE and R-2 < 0.5, whereas Yangjiaping was >0.5 in combination with the other two sites. (ii) The sensitive parameters obtained by the two calibration strategies were different, and different parameters were effective for different-sized catchments because hydrological processes exhibit astounding variability at all scales. The single-site one-by-one calibration was mainly affected by the hydrological processes of the local catchment, whereas the multi-site joint calibration was largely constrained by the sensitive parameters of the single-site calibration. (iii) Parameters at different scales and locations were related to the problem of scaling and regionalization. The multi-site joint calibration did not significantly improve the model performance of the watershed outlet but increased the capacity for synchronous identification of local sensitive parameters when compared to single-site calibration. These findings are expected to provide experience for parameter calibration in other similar large-scale watersheds and to lay a good foundation for the accurate identification of other related hydrological behaviours at watershed scales.

Identified as a key ecological area, southwest China (SWC) has experienced frequent extreme climatic events. Using daily meteorological data and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data, we analyzed the spatiotemporal variations of 21 extreme climate indices (ECIs) and 3 ecosystem metrics, namely, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI), and gross primary production (GPP), as well as the responses of these metrics to ECIs during 2000-2018. Our results showed that the regionally averaged NDVI, LAI, and GPP increased significantly in this period with annual rates of 0.003, 0.04 m(2) m(-2), and 10.58 g C m(-2), respectively (P < 0.001). Cold-related ECIs and consecutive wet days decreased, while warm-related ECIs, heavy precipitation days, and extreme precipitation intensity displayed the opposite trend. The sums (22.48%, 12.98%, and 32.70%, respectively) of the relative contribution proportions of the sensitive temperature-related ECIs (T-ECIs) to NDVI, LAI, and GPP were higher than that those (14.60%, 12.75%, and 16.37%, respectively) of the sensitive precipitation-related ECIs (P-ECIs). Ecosystem metrics were significantly correlated with most ECIs with time lags of 2-3-month. The correlation coefficients between large-scale atmospheric circulation indices and T-ECIs were significant (P < 0.05). The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation had a greater influence on T-ECIs than any other large-scale climatic oscillations. Our study indicated that T-ECIs had a greater impact on ecosystems than P-ECIs in SWC and that more attention should be paid to increasingly heavy precipitation and extreme high temperatures in the region.

However, the quantitative assessment of soil carbon in profile and its dynamics affected by vegetation restoration and erosion is still extremely inadequate. In this study, we synthesized soil and vegetation properties, stable carbon isotopic compositions, and radiocarbon ages to investigate the soil carbon processes in two temperate forests of different successional stages (Populus forest versus Quercus forest) on the Chinese Loess Plateau. The objectives of this study are to (1) examine the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) in the topsoil and subsoil, and (2) evaluate the effect of vegetation restoration and historical erosion on the changes of SOC and SIC in the temperate forests. We found that from Populus to Quercus forests, the SOC stock increased in the topsoil but declined in the subsoil, whereas the SIC stock exhibited a completely opposite variation trend. The significant increase in litter biomass enhanced the SOC in the topsoil, while a stronger historical erosion and priming effect would contribute to the decrease of SOC in the subsoil along succession. Changes in delta C-13 and Delta C-14 in the soil profile provided evidence that the turnover rate of SOC increase in the topsoil but decrease in the subsoil along succession. Over the past 10,000 years, due to soil erosion process, the estimated loss of the SOC and SIC was 26.2 and 64.1 Mg ha(-1) in Populus forest and 20.2 and 42.6 Mg ha(-1) in the Quercus forest.

A 3-yr study was conducted at the Aba Gerima watershed in northwestern Ethiopia, to investigate the effects of two tillage practices (reduced tillage [RT] and conventional tillage [CT]), two planting methods (row planting [RP] and broadcast planting [BP]), and two compaction options (with [+T] and without [-T] trampling) on soil loss and teff yields in a split-split plot arrangement. Sediment concentration ranged from 0.01 to 5.37 g L-1 (mean, 0.25 g L-1) in our study. Accordingly, the estimated total (August-October) soil loss ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 t ha(-1) (mean, 0.3 t ha(-1)). The sediment concentration and total soil loss were significantly influenced (P < 0.05) by tillage, planting methods, and trampling only in the third monitoring year. RT reduced soil loss by 19% relative to that of CT, whereas RP resulted in a 13% reduction in soil loss over BP. The -T plots showed a 15% reduction in soil loss as compared to + T plots. Results revealed significant increase in soil total carbon and nitrogen in RT and -T. Less soil loss and greater teff grain yield were obtained in plots with improved agronomic practices (RT and RP) compared to conventional ones (CT and BP). Based on our findings we conclude that the use of RT, RP, and -T practices can effectively minimize soil loss without any crop yield penalty.

The vegetation status in Qinghai Province has undergone substantial changes, which are more pronounced than other regions in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. However, a clear understanding of the response characteristics of plateau vegetation to extreme climate events is currently lacking. In this study, we investigated the response of net primary productivity (NPP) to different forms of extreme climate events across regions characterized by varying levels of aridity and elevation gradients. Specifically, we observed a significant increase in NPP in relatively arid regions. Our findings indicate that, in relatively arid regions, single episodes of high-intensity precipitation have a pronounced positive effect (higher correlation) on NPP. Furthermore, in high-elevation regions (4000-6000 m), both the intensity and frequency of precipitation events are crucial factors for the increase in regional NPP. However, continuous precipitation can have significant negative impacts on certain areas within relatively wet regions. Regarding temperature, a reduction in the number of frost days within a year has been shown to lead to a significant increase in NPP in arid regions. This reduction allows vegetation growth rate to increase in regions where it was limited by low temperatures. Vegetation conditions in drought-poor regions are expected to continue to improve as extreme precipitation intensifies and extreme low-temperature events decrease.																			0020-7128	1432-1254				2023 DEC 5	2023										10.1007/s00484-023-02593-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-023-02593-2		DEC 2023						38052751					WOS:001113210000001

Policy implications of multiple concurrent soil erosion processes in European farmland	NATURE SUSTAINABILITY												Soil erosion is a serious threat to soil functions leading to land productivity decline and multiple off-site effects. Here we show, using a multi-model approach, the spatial risk of soil erosion by water, wind, tillage and harvesting and where the co-occurrence of these different processes is observed. Moreover, we analysed where these locations of multiple erosion co-occurrence are likely to intersect with the projected increase of dry/wet climate conditions. Of the similar to 110 million hectares (M ha) of arable land in the European Union, our estimates show that 43 M ha are vulnerable to a single driver of erosion, 15.6 M ha to two drivers and 0.81 M ha to three or more drivers. About 3.2 M ha of arable land are vulnerable to the possible interaction of increased flood, drought, water and wind erosion. We contend that this set of predictions serves as a basis for developing an efficient stratified monitoring network and informing targeted mitigation strategies under the Common Agricultural Policy 2023-2027. The road to the sustainable, carbon-neutral and biodiversity-friendly system of agriculture advocated for in the EU Green Deal goes through a thematic strategy for soil protection from multiple concurrent erosion processes.

However, weather ensembles containing the unknown future weather conditions occurring after prediction dates are essential for such predictions using crop models. Two strategies were established for selecting analogue weather years as the target growing season based on a five-year maize experiment conducted at eight sites in the Loess Plateau of China. The first strategy tried weather data from different lengths of years ahead the planting year. The second strategy used the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm to select analogue weather according to different combinations of weather variables with daily or accumulative values. The results showed that satisfactory predictions could be obtained after maize tasseling (about 50 d prior to maturity). The mean absolute relative error (ARE) and coefficient of variation (CV) of the daily yield predictions after tasseling were 6.6% and 5.7%, respectively, in 2010 at the Yulin site. In the leadingyear strategy, the most reliable predictions were obtained by the weather data from the 10 years ahead of planting, with an overall average ARE of 11.7%. In the k-NN strategy, the most reliable predictions were obtained by using the analogue weather selected with only accumulative precipitation, with an overall average ARE of 11.5%. Additionally, both of the two optimal strategies improved the original predictions in most cases. However, the k-NN strategy was more likely to generate worse predictions in the early part of the growing season. Generally, it was more convenient to use the weather data of 10 leading years before the planting year to represent the unknown weather data after the prediction dates. This strategy provided reliable prediction accuracy without complex programming and requirement for long-term weather records.

We analyzed winter chilling and spring forcing accumulation in relation to the spring phenology of three tree species (Ulmus pumila, Populus simonii, and Syringa oblata) growing in a cold region (CR) compared with trees in a warmer reference region (WR), using the Dynamic Model and the Growing Degree Hour (GDH) model. We tested that forcing rather than chilling affects the spring phenology of trees in CR (hypothesis I), and that trees in CR have both lower mean chilling and forcing temperature and thus longer accumulation periods than trees in WR (hypothesis II). The modeling results confirmed that chilling and forcing occur simultaneously during the early spring when temperature gradually increases. In line with our hypotheses, forcing played a crucial role in spring phenology in CR, but chilling and forcing combined to determine spring phenology in WR. The temperature during the chilling and forcing periods was lower and the accumulation period started earlier and ended later in CR than in WR. Moreover, the chilling accumulation was broken into two periods by the low deep winter temperature in CR, and that interruption will be removed by future strong winter warming. Future asymmetric warming, with a stronger temperature increase in winter than in spring, could decrease the forcing accumulation effects and increase the chilling effects on the spring phenology of plants in CR. This change in the balance between chilling and forcing will lead to a shift in plant phenology, which will further have major impacts on biogeochemical cycles and on ecosystem functions and services.

PCR and transgenic assays were used to elucidate the exact sequences and biological function of Pb-binding proteins and heterogeneous expression of Pb-binding flagellin in E. colt could significantly enhance Pb removal from aqueous solution by approximately 45%. This method provides a benchmark procedure to rapidly identify biological factors responsible for metal bio-sorption. Identification of this unique Pb-binding flagellin highlights that microorganisms can survive high metal stresses due to various complex biological pathways for metal detoxification and remediation.

However, few studies have been done specifically on Cd(II) removal by composites of potassium phosphates with biochar, and the removal potential and mechanisms are not clear. Herein, apple tree branches, a major agricultural waste suitable for the development of porous materials, were pyrolyzed individually or together with KH2PO4, K2HPO4 center dot 3H(2)O, or K3PO4 center dot 3H(2)O to obtain biochars to remove Cd(II), denoted as pristine BC, BC-1, BC-2, and BC-3, respectively. The results showed that the orthophosphates containing more K+ enlarged the specific surface area, total pore volume and phosphorus loading of biochar. Co-pyrolysis of apple tree branches and P promoted the thermochemical transformation of P species. Only weak signal of orthophosphate was observed in the pristine BC, while the presence of orthophosphate, pyrophosphate and meta-phosphate were detected in BC-1, and BC-2 and BC-3 showed the presence of orthophosphate and pyrophosphate. The maximum Cd(II) adsorption capacities of pristine BC, BC-1, BC-2 and BC-3 were 10.4, 88.5, 95.8, and 116 mg.g(-1), respectively. Orthophosphate modification enhanced the Cd(II) adsorption capacity due to the formation of Cd-P-precipitates, namely Cd-5(PO4)(3)Cl, Cd-5(PO4)(3)OH, Cd-3(PO4)(2), Cd2P2O7, and Cd(PO3)(2). Furthermore, higher cat-ion exchange efficiencies between Cd(II) and K+ in P-modified biochars also contributed to their high Cd(II) adsorp-tion capacity. Cd(II) removal by BC-3 from artificially polluted water bodies showed more than 99.98% removal rates. Application of BC-3 also reduced the diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid-extracted Cd(II) in soil by 69.1%. The co-pyrolysis of apple tree branches and potassium phosphates shows great prospect in Cd(II) wastewater/soil treatment and provide a promising solution for agricultural waste utilization and carbon sequestration.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				MAY 1	2022	819								152876	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152876	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152876		JAN 2022						34998767					WOS:000766803100006

However, limited knowledge exists regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying wax biosynthesis in trees. Here, PeSHN1, an AP2/ethylene response factor transcription factor, was isolated from a fast-growing poplar Populus x euramericana cv. 'Neva' clone. To study the potential biological functions of PeSHN1, transgenic 84K poplar (Populus alba x Populus glandulosa) plants overexpressing PeSHN1 were generated. PeSHN1 overexpression resulted in decreased transpiration, increased water-use efficiency (WUE) and increased drought tolerance. The transgenic poplar plants exhibited increased wax accumulation and altered wax composition, mainly because of a substantial increase in long-chain (>C30) fatty acids, aldehydes and alkanes. Gene expression analyses revealed that many genes involved in wax biosynthesis were induced in the PeSHN1 overexpression plants. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR assays and dual luciferase assays revealed that at least one of those genes, LACS2, is likely targeted by PeSHN1. Moreover, the PeSHN1 overexpression plants maintained higher photosynthetic activity and accumulated more biomass under drought stress conditions. Taken together, these results suggest that PeSHN1 regulates both WUE and drought tolerance in poplar by modulating wax biosynthesis and that altered PeSHN1 expression could represent a novel approach (altering the wax trait on leaf surfaces to increase WUE) for breeding drought-tolerant plants.

In this study, we investigated the effects of different rainfall types on rill erosion and the degree of rill dissection of roads involving petroleum transportation and agricultural production in the hilly and gully region on the Loess Plateau of China from 2019 to 2021. During this period, 30 natural rainfall events occurred that were classified into four rainfall types using K-means clustering analysis.The results indicated that road erosion caused by large amount of rainfall with high intensity (LH-R) was 4.31, 3.82, and 3.48 times higher than that with small amount of rainfall with high intensity (SH-R), small amount of rainfall with low intensity (SL-R), and large amount with low intensity (LL-R), respectively. This highlighted the devastating impact of the LH-R on road erosion (the most severe of all types), with an average erosion rate of 527.04 t ha- 1. Road erosion caused by SL-R events (most frequent) during the rainy season also deserves attention because of its cumulative impact on rill erosion. Moreover, compared to bare runoff plots and sloping farmlands, unpaved roads experienced a greater erosion rate due to upslope drainage areas and frequent human disturbance. In addition, the drainage system mitigates road erosion under LH-R, thereby reducing the average erosion rate by 56.42 %. We also found that road rehabilitation impedes the development of rills and diminishes the rate of road erosion compared to road segments without road rehabilitation.Collectively, the effects of rainfall types and maintenance activities on road erosion were assessed. The findings indicate that strengthening water and land management of upslope drainage areas, complementing the drainage system of unpaved roads, maintaining appropriate maintenance activities, and promoting vegetation coverage on the downslope of roads mitigate the resistance of unpaved roads to LH-R.

Impact of spatial variations in water quality and hydrological factors on the food-web structure in urban aquatic environments	WATER RESEARCH												Global aquatic ecosystems are essential to human existence and have deteriorated seriously in recent years. Understanding the influence mechanism of habitat variation on the structure of the food-web allows the effective recovery of the health of degraded ecosystems. Whereas most previous studies focused on the selection of driving habitat factors, the impact of habitat variation on the food-web structure was rarely studied, resulting in the low success rate of ecosystem restoration projects globally. This paper presents a framework for exploring the effects of spatial variations in water quality and hydrological habitat factors on the food-web structure in city waters. Indices for the evaluation of the food-web structure are first determined by integrating model-parameter extraction via literature refinement. The key water quality and hydrological factors are then determined by coupling canonical correspondence analysis with partial least squares regression. Their spatial variation is investigated using spatial autocorrelation. Finally, fuzzy clustering is applied to analyze the influence of the spatial variations in water quality and hydrological factors on the food-web structure. The results obtained in Ji'nan, the pilot city of water ecological civilization in China, show that the Shannon diversity index, connectance index, omnivory index, and the ratio of total primary production to the total respiration are important indicators of food-web structural change. They show that the driving factors affecting the aquatic food-web structure in Ji'nan are hydrological factors (e.g., river width, water depth, and stream flow), physical aspects of water quality (e.g., air temperature, water temperature, electrical conductivity, and transparency), and chemical aspects (e.g., potassium, dissolved oxygen, calcium, and total hardness). They also show that the stability of the food-web is more prone to spatial variations in water quality than in hydrological factors. Higher electrical conductivity, potassium, total hardness, and air temperature lead to deteriorated food-web structures, whereas better transparency improves structure and stability. We found that water and air temperature are the most important factors in the spatial variation of the food-web structure in the study area, followed by total hardness. Transparency is the least important factor. Large disparities and varied spatial distributions exist in the driving effects of water quality and hydrological factors across regions attributable to differences in geographical environments, water salinity (fresh vs. sea water), and environmental factors (e.g., water pollution). The above methods and results serve as a theoretical and scientific basis for a high success rate of aquatic ecosystem restoration projects in the study area and other cities worldwide.

Moreover, the optimal rill morphological indicators for rill erosion evaluation were selected based on the relationship of rill morphological parameters and erosion amount. The results showed that total rill length (L), rill density (p), maximum width (Wmax), the degree of contour line departure (mu) and shape ratio (I) increased with the increase of slope gradient, whilst the mean rill depth (Dmean), mean rill width (Wmean) and width/depth ratio (W/D) decreased with the increase of slope gradient. The spatial distribution pattern of each rill morphology parameter was also changed with slope gradient, showing differences in upper slope, central slope and lower slope. Most of rill morphological parameters were highly correlated with rill erosion amount, except the mean rill width (Wmean), degree of contour line departure (mu), and rill density (p). The plane area of rill (Parea) or the degree of rill dissection (o) was selected as the optimal morphological parameter to predict rill erosion amount, followed by the maximum area of cross section (CSmax), the maximum rill depth (Dmax), and the mean rill depth (Dmean). In particular, the parameters of CSmax and Dmax are recommended for rill erosion estimation based on the conve-nience and ease of data acquisition.					zhang, yue/JAC-3705-2023; LI, Xiang/JBJ-8387-2023; Wang, lili/IXD-9828-2023; .., What/IXW-6776-2023; wang, yue/ISA-4119-2023; Wang, Xuezhen/IUN-6267-2023; ma, long/JHU-2289-2023; Wang, Yiping/IZQ-2052-2023; liu, xinyu/IWD-6630-2023; ZHAO, S/IWV-4219-2023; Wang, Xingyu/JNE-0602-2023; Ma, Xiaodong/JAN-7473-2023; wang, juan/IUO-6218-2023; wang, yu/IUQ-6654-2023	sun, liying/0000-0003-0629-6079													0341-8162	1872-6887				MAR	2023	222								106895	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106895	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106895		DEC 2022											WOS:000960832400001

Allan; Bai, Yanfu			An increase in livestock density increases forage nutritional value but decreases net primary production and annual forage nutritional yield in the alpine grassland of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Pasture biomass and quality are dependent on herbivore grazing and precipitation, but the responses of vegetation to the interactive effects of climate and grazing regimes remain unclear. We conducted an eight-year sheep grazing experiment with 4 stocking rates (0, 3.5, 5.5, and 7.5 sheep/ha) in an alpine meadow of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. The above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) and forage nutritional value (FNV) of four dominant species (Poa annua, Kobresia humilis, Astragalus adsurgens and Potentilla fruticosa) were measured during a wet year (360 mm rainfall) and a drought year (216 mm rainfall). The FNV was used as indicator of forage quality and was calculated from the crude protein (CP) content, in vitro true dry matter digestibility (IVTD), metabolic energy (ME) yield, and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content of the plant. The stocking rate explained a minimum of 76% of the variations of ANPP, and the precipitation sub-additive effect for ANPP ranged from 5% to 12%. The interaction of sheep stocking rate and precipitation affected ANPP of the 4 species, except for P. fruticosa. The FNV of the pasture increased with increasing grazing pressure, but ANPP and forage nutritional yield (FNY) decreased. In calculating FNY, the increase in FNV did not compensate for the decrease in ANPP. In non-grazed plots, the CP yield declined sharply (18%-55%) in response to drought, but there was no effect on ME yield. The interaction between stocking rate and precipitation affected forage quality of the 4 plant species differently. The grassland ANPP and FNY could be maintained at a grazing intensity of 3.5 sheep/ha in wet and dry years. Our results highlight that stocking density affects pasture ANPP and FNV, and is contingent on rainfall.

Traditional handling and processing of dairy products using basic equipment and infrastructure coupled with a preference for raw milk consumption pose potential health risks to consumers. We tested the effect of an intervention designed to improve the hygienic handling and safe consumption of milk on the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of women who produce and sell dairy products. The intervention consisted of 16 h of training on good milk production practices and prevention of milk-borne diseases. A total of 120 women were trained and their KAP assessed at baseline (pretraining), immediately after training, and 6 mo after training. Overall, training increased the knowledge score of the participants from 75.6 to 91.4% in the immediate past-training assessment, and to 90.0% at 6 mo post-training. Compared with pretraining (58.8%), we found a statistically significant difference in the overall attitude score at the immediate post-training evaluation (64.7%) but not 6 mo after (61.4%). We observed a similar increase in the understanding of correct practices from 49.5% at pretraining to 64.7% 6 mo following the training. For some desirable attitudes and practices, the proportion of women reporting adoption at pretraining was low and the change derived from training still left one-third of respondents displaying a negative attitude and a quarter of them reporting wrong practices. We recommend that future training interventions be complemented with locally adaptable technologies, provision of incentives, and creation of an enabling environment including improved access to clean water and sanitation facilities to affect not only knowledge, but also attitudes and ultimately practices in the long term.					; Kerro Dego, Oudessa/L-5286-2018; Ejeta, Kebede Amenu/E-6876-2018	Agga, Getahun/0000-0002-9903-5283; Kerro Dego, Oudessa/0000-0003-2108-8905; Kumbe, Adem/0000-0003-3496-6316; Wieland, Barbara/0000-0003-4020-9186; Grace, Delia/0000-0002-0195-9489; Ejeta, Kebede Amenu/0000-0002-0985-2950													0022-0302	1525-3198				NOV	2020	103	11					9748	9757		10.3168/jds.2020-18292	http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2020-18292								33076186					WOS:000579895400007

This study selects the Goulburn River catchment that is located in southeastern Australia having more than 100 years of streamflow observations and more than 90 years of mining history, and divides the streamflow period from 1913 to 2015 into four sub-periods: 1913-1920 (no mining), 1921-1950 (small-scale underground mining), 1951-1980 (commence of new underground mining) and 1981-2015 (large-scale mining of open cut and underground mining). Process-based hydrological modelling (SIMHYD), simple one-parameter hydrological model (Budyko-based method) and a data-driven approach (the double mass curve, DMC), are used to assess mining-related centennial streamflow changes and to quantify relative contributions of climate variability and mining activities on streamflow. These results show that streamflow increased during periods of underground mining, which is likely due to over-pumping to sustain the underground mining. The difference between the observed streamflow and the SIMHYD simulated was very marginal in the reference period of 1913-1920; while it increased by 3.39 mm yr(-1) in 1921-1950 and by 10.51 mm yr(-1) in 1951-1980. The DMC slope increased from 0.021 in 1913-1920 to 0.025 in 1921-1950, then 0.033 in 1951-1980. These impacts of underground mining on increased streamflow have been greatly reduced and even become negative when open cut mining was largely expanded. The average difference of streamflow during the period of 1981-2015 was reduced from 10.51 mm yr(-1) to 2.84 mm yr(-1). The DMC slope decreased from 0.033 in 1951-1980 to 0.027 in 1981-2015. The contributions between climate changes and mining activities to streamflow changes estimated using these methods are consistent in trends in different mining periods, but noticeably different in magnitudes.

Understanding the physiological and molecular responses of E. grandis to abiotic stress is essential for developing strategies to improve its drought resistance. This study focuses on the potential vulnerability of E. grandis during the initial months of root system proliferation and investigates the role of the essential oil-derived compound Taxol in enhancing its drought resistance. Methodology: A comprehensive analysis was performed on various aspects of E. grandis, including morphological features, photosynthetic rates, pigment concentrations, nitrogenous components, and lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, the study examined the accumulation of soluble carbohydrates, proline, and antioxidant enzymes as part of the tree's response to drought stress. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to determine the binding affinity of Taxol, an essential oil derived from Taxus brevifolia, with the VIT1 protein in E. grandis. Results: E. grandis displayed remarkable resilience to drought by accumulating vast reserves of soluble carbohydrates, proline, and antioxidant enzymes. The essential oil-derived compound Taxol exhibited a strong binding affinity with the VIT1 protein (-10.23 kcal/mol), suggesting its potential role in enhancing the tree's drought resistance. Conclusion: This study reveals the pivotal role of Taxol in augmenting the resilience of E. grandis against drought stress and improving its therapeutic oil tproperties. Emphasizing the tree's inherent tolerance during its susceptible early stages is crucial in promoting sustainable agriculture and forestry practices. The findings underscore the importance of advanced scientific research in uncovering the concealed capabilities of robust trees like E. grandis as we continue our pursuit of a sustainable future.

We used multiple approaches to assess the benefits of rhizobium (Rh) inoculation and phosphorus (P) fertilization on soybean yield increase and profitability from large-scale conducted trials in the savanna areas of Nigeria [i.e., the Sudan Savanna (SS), Northern Guinea Savanna (NGS), and Southern Guinea Savanna (SGS)]. Soybean yield results from the established trials managed by farmers with four treatments (i.e., the control without inoculation and P fertilizer, Rh inoculation, P fertilizer, and Rh + P combination treatments) were predicted using mapped soil properties and weather variables in ensemble machine-learning techniques, specifically the conditional inference regression random forest (RF) model. Using the IMPACT model, scenario analyses were employed to simulate long-term adoption impacts on national soybean trade and currency. Our study found that yields of the Rh + P combination were consistently higher than the control in the three agroecological zones. Average yield increases were 128%, 111%, and 162% higher in the Rh + P combination compared to the control treatment in the SS, NGS, and SGS agroecological zones, respectively. The NGS agroecological zone showed a higher yield than SS and SGS. The highest training coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.75) for yield prediction was from the NGS dataset, and the lowest coefficient (R-2 = 0.46) was from the SS samples. The results from the IMPACT model showed a reduction of 10% and 22% for the low (35% adoption scenario) and high (75% adoption scenario) soybean imports from 2029 in Nigeria, respectively.

Accurately forecasting the first-flowering time of apple trees can assist orchard managers in their deciding when to apply anti-freeze. The temperature-driven sequential model from previous studies can be used to forecast the flowering phenology of deciduous fruit trees. However, this model requires many years of observational data for calibration, so flowering forecasts based on traditional phenological models cannot be implemented in areas that lack such historical data. To overcome this problem, the present work combines a spatial rather than a temporal phenological survey method with 1-km-gridded temperature products to calibrate the chill and heat requirement parameters of the sequential model. We then use the model to forecast the first-flowering on a regional scale for Luochuan and Linyi, which are two main apple-producing areas of China. The results show that the proposed method accurately forecasts regional flowering. The root mean squared errors (RMSE) for Luochuan and Linyi were 4.7 and 4.4 days, respectively, and the normalized RMSEs were all less than 5.19%. We expect the proposed regional first-flowering forecast method to be an important aid to optimize orchard management.

The adsorbent were characterized by SEM-EDS mapping, TEM, BET, XPS, FTIR, Raman spectroscopy and zeta potential. The characterization results indicated that L-HPC contained three-dimensional connected channels and many adsorbing N, O and other adsorption groups, which is very beneficial for Cr(VI) adsorption. The kinetics showed that the L-HPC adsorption of Cr(VI) was chemical adsorption and mainly controlled by intraparticle diffusion. The isotherm and thermodynamics indicated that L-HPC adsorption of Cr(VI) conforms to the Freundlich model, L-HPC is a kind of multimolecular layer adsorbent, and the adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) by LHPC was 887.8 mg/g, which was significantly higher than values for other adsorbents. Ion competition simulation and actual water body tests showed that L-HPC exhibits high selectivity for Cr(VI) adsorption, adsorption cycle experiments show that L-HPC maintains over 83% performance after 12 cycles. Cost analysis shows that LHPC is suitable for mass production. Therefore, L-HPC is a Cr(VI) adsorbent with high efficiency, high selectivity, and high reusability, which is broadly applicable and shows favorable prospects.

AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Agricultural interventions such as biochar, grassing, and different planting modes affect the migration and transformation of soil phosphorus (P). However, the effect of different management practices on the mechanism of runoff P fractions and possible tradeoffs associated with consecutive rainstorms is not well understood. This study aggregated management practices (biochar, grassing, and planting modes) to evaluate the surface pathways of P loss from loessial bare and grassed slopes with different slope angles (10 degrees, 15 degrees, and 20 degrees) and consecutive rainstorms (60, 90, and 120 mm.h(-1)). Results indicated that: (i) The highest sediment yield rate and total phosphorus loss concentrations were registered during the first rainstorm event (10 degrees slope and 60 mm.h(-1)). Soil erosion and P loss under different rainfall intensities could be effectively reduced by 0-3% biochar grassed slope with horizontal ridge but were aggravated under bare slope with 3-6% biochar or grassed slope with 6% biochar. (ii) Planting grass on bare slope could effectively mitigate erosion and runoff P at different rainfall intensities, and the reduction rate increased with increased rainfall intensity. The sediment reduction effect of bare slope with horizontal ridge decreased with increased rainfall intensity and was liable to fail in the 90 and 120 mm.h(-1) rainfall intensities. (iii) The particulate phosphorus (PP) was the primary loss fraction of soil P from loessial sloping land (> 80%), and PP increased with increased biochar content and rainfall intensity but reduced by grass and horizontal ridge interventions. Integrating grass with horizontal ridge was considered to be the most effective way to control erosion and protect soil fertility. These outcomes provide underlying insights for employing appropriate best management practices (BMPs) to decrease runoff P on sloping soils, which can be highlighted through a reasonable allocation of biochar, ridge, growing plants, and other BMPs.					wu, lei/D-3286-2017; Wu, Lei/JDC-4172-2023; Ma, Xiaoyi/HJH-6205-2023	wu, lei/0000-0002-5602-674X; 													0378-3774	1873-2283				OCT 1	2021	256								107121	10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107121		AUG 2021											WOS:000696806100007

We hypothesized that differences in water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) in soils of varying land uses and rainfall events may significantly affect the quality and the quantity of stream DOM. To test our hypotheses, characteristics of rainfall-runoff DOM and WEOM of source materials (topsoil from different land uses and gullies, as well as typical vegetation) were investigated at two adjacent catchments in the Loess Plateau of China, using ultraviolet-visible absorbance and excitation emission matrix fluorescence with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Results indicated that land-use types may significantly affect the chemical composition of soil WEOM, including its aromaticity, molecular weight, and degree of humification. The PARAFAC analysis demonstrated that the soils and stream water were dominated by terrestrial/allochthonous humic-like substances and microbial transformable humic-like fluorophores. Shifts in the fluorescence properties of stream DOM suggested a pronounced change in the relative proportion of allochthonous versus autochthonous material under different rainfall patterns and land uses. For example, high proportions of forestland could provide more allochthonous DOM input. This study highlights the relevance of soils and hydrological dynamics on the composition and fluxes of DOM issuing from watersheds. The composition of DOM in soils was influenced by land-use type. Precipitation patterns influenced the proportion of terrestrial versus microbial origins of DOM in surface runoff. Contributions of allochthonous, terrestrially derived DOM inputs were highest from forested landscapes.

Tibetan sheep require less energy intake than small-tailed Han sheep for N balance when offered a low protein diet	ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Tibetan sheep are indigenous to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and graze natural pasture all year round; small-tailed Han sheep were introduced to the plateau, are raised mainly in feedlots and graze natural pasture only in summer. A low energy intake could have a negative effect on N utilization and N balance in ruminants. We hypothesized that Tibetan sheep require less energy for N balance and utilize N more efficiently than Han sheep when offered a low protein and low energy diet. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of dietary energy on whole-body N retention and urea kinetics in Tibetan (47.7 +/- 2.46 kg BW) and Han (46.2 +/- 3.42 kg BW) sheep. Diets were formulated to be low in crude protein (7%) with different metabolizable energy levels (6.73, 7.65, 8.57 and 9.49 MJ/kg). Urea kinetics were determined using continuous intrajugular infusion of (NN)-N-15-N-15-urea for 72 h. N retention was greater (P < 0.01) in Tibetan than in Han sheep and increased linearly with increasing energy intake (P < 0.001). Tibetan sheep maintained a positive N balance on all dietary energy levels, whereas Han sheep were in a negative N balance at the lowest energy intake. To achieve a N balance of zero, Tibetan sheep required 0.28 MJ/kg(0.75), whereas Han sheep required 0.33 MJ/kg(0.75) per day. Fecal N excretion was less (P < 0.05) for Tibetan than for Han sheep. Plasma urea concentrations tended to be greater in Tibetan than in Han sheep (P < 0.10), but urinary urea excretion was lower in Tibetan sheep at the lowest energy diet (linear dietary energy x breed; P < 0.05). As energy intake increased, urinary N decreased linearly (P < 0.001) and microbial N production increased linearly (P < 0.001). Urea entry rate and gastrointestinal tract entry rate were greater in Tibetan than in Han sheep (P < 0.01). Urinary purine derivatives excretion, microbial N production, and the portion of microbial N that originated from recycled urea were greater in Tibetan than in Han sheep (P < 0.01). Renal urea reabsorption rate was greater in Tibetan than in Han sheep (P < 0.05) and increased linearly with dietary energy level (P < 0.05). We concluded that: 1) Tibetan sheep were better able to cope with low N diets when energy intake was low; and 2) when N intakes are low, N utilization is improved by supplemental energy.

However, this covariation and its spatiotemporal response mechanisms are still unclear, especially whether this covariation can be used as a basis for identifying critical source areas of sediment in large-scale ecological restored watersheds. In this study, an integrated methodology framework by the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE), index of connectivity (IC) and sediment delivery ratio (SDR) was proposed to visually assess the spatiotemporal characteristics of erosion and sediment yield processes in the Yanhe Watershed with large-scale ecological restoration from 1985 to 2020 and to identify the covariation between sediment connectivity and erosion in subbasins. The soil erosion estimated by RUSLE has decreased by over 80% since 1985 owing to increased vegetation cover and the effective implementation of soil conservation measures, but the upper reaches still have high erosion intensity due to differences in specific controlling factors such as topographic conditions and land cover, requiring focused soil conservation practice. The IC results showed that as the vegetation restoration and soil conservation measures in the Yanhe Watershed varied from year to year, their spatial and temporal patterns had a strong influence on the distribution of sediment connectivity, and some local areas in the middle reaches showed local minima of IC in 1995, 1998 and 2010 mainly due to the implementation of long-term ecological restoration project. The developed IC-Erosion maps indicated that areas with high connectivity but low erosion accounted for over 60% of the total watershed area from 1985 to 1999, demonstrating a reverse correlation between sediment connectivity and erosion. Meanwhile, over 40% of the erosion occurred in a few areas (approximately 20%) with high connectivity and high erosion from 2000 to 2004, which can be characterized as the critical areas of erosion. The methods and results of this study provide ideas for separately defining both erosion and connectivity and quantifying bi-variable erosion-connectivity classification, which can be easily viewed on a scatterplot.

The present study analyzed the separate and combined effects of these two factors on annual surface runoff and evapotranspiration (ET) after validating the selected models in three drought-prone watersheds of the Upper Blue Nile basin: Kasiry (highland), Kecha (midland), and Sahi (lowland). LULC maps were produced from aerial photographs and very-high-resolution satellite images from 1982, 2005/06 and 2016/17. During 1982-2016/17 the area covered by natural vegetation showed dramatic decreases, ranging from 602% in Kasiry to 51.8% in Sahi. In contrast, increases in cultivated land ranged from 367% in Kasily to 279.6% in Sahi; the smaller increase in Kasiry resulted from the conversion of a portion of the cultivated land to an Acacia decunens plantation after 2006. The observed LULC changes over the study period resulted in runoff increases ranging from 4% in Kecha to 28.7% in Kasiry. Climate variability in terms of annual rainfall had no significant effect on estimated runoff; whereas both LULC change and climate variability had significant effect on estimated ET. Though climate variability increased ET from 33.6% in Kecha to 42.1% in Kasity, the LULC change related to the reduction in natural vegetation had an offsetting effect, which led to overall decreases in ET ranging from 15.8% in Kasiry to 32.8% in Kecha watershed. As changes in LULC and climate are expected to intensify in the future, it is important to study further hydrological responses considering these changes to devise future sustainable land and water management strategies.

Selecting higher nutritive value annual pasture legumes increases the profitability of sheep production	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												CONTEXT: The nutritive value of annual pasture legumes changes with phenology during each season, with a progressive decrease in feeding value as plants accumulate structural carbohydrates and nutrients are diluted. However, these changes differ widely among annual legume species, affecting the pattern of nutrient availability and production in a grazing enterprise. OBJECTIVE: This paper set out to examine the implications of differences in the nutritive value of annual pasture legumes in relation to their economic value for mixed farming systems of southern Australia. METHODS: Calibrated GrassGroTM plant models with data generated from field experiments to represent Dry Matter Digestibility (DMD) profiles of six annual legume species; Medicago truncatula Gaertn. (barrel medic), B. pelecinus L. (biserrula), Trifolium spumosum L. (bladder clover), Ornithopus sativus Brot. (French serradella), Medicago littoralis Rhode ex Loisel. (strand medic) and Trifolium subterraneum L. (subterranean clover). The plant models were used in a modelling study to support a self-replacing Merino sheep enterprise, which was simulated at seven locations across southern Australia, where annual pasture species are heavily relied on for livestock production. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Modelled values of DMD of green material, averaged across all phenological stages, ranged from approximately 62% (French serradella) to 73% (bladder clover), with little variation due to location. Pastures with higher nutritive value had a reduced requirement for supplementary feeding of sheep. Variation in nutritive value had a greater effect on supplementary feeding costs and gross margins than differences in biomass production among the annual legume species. Differences in the levels of supplementary feeding required in systems with the different legumes was most pronounced during the period from May to July (late autumn to winter). For sheep enterprises compared at the same stocking rate, the total supplementary feed required was 18% lower with bladder clover pastures, and 9% lower in subterranean clover pastures, compared with an average of the remaining four pasture species. SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study to compare the effects of variation in nutritive value among the annual pasture legumes developed for the soils and climatic conditions of southern Australia. Our results demonstrated that the magnitude of differences in nutritive value among annual pasture legumes are economically important and that the establishment of higher nutritive value legumes will reduce supplementary feeding costs in extensive grazing systems, in some cases even where their biomass production is lower.

However, we still have a poor understanding of what nutrients limit soil microbial metabolism that drives soil carbon release across the range of boreal to tropical forests. Here we used ecoenzymatic stoichiometry methods to investigate the patterns of microbial nutrient limitations within soil profiles (organic, eluvial and parent material horizons) across 181 forest sites throughout China. Results show that, in 80% of these forests, soil microbes were limited by phosphorus availability. Microbial phosphorus limitation increased with soil depth and from boreal to tropical forests as ecosystems become wetter, warmer, more productive, and is affected by anthropogenic nitrogen deposition. We also observed an unexpected shift in the latitudinal pattern of microbial phosphorus limitation with the lowest phosphorus limitation in the warm temperate zone (41-42 degrees N). Our study highlights the importance of soil phosphorus limitation to restoring forests and predicting their carbon sinks. Phosphorus limitation of soil microbial communities in forests is widespread, increases with soil depth, and is enhanced under wetter and warmer climates and elevated anthropogenic nitrogen deposition, according to ecoenzymatic stoichiometric analyses across 181 forests in China.

In this short communication, we review previous distribution models of the fire salamander (Salamandra infraimmaculata) in northern Israel, produced by the group of the late Prof. Leon Blaustein, while suggesting a biologically-infor med reinterpretation of their main predictions. We argue for the prime importance of bedrock, specifically hard limestone, because it is tightly associated with the availability of karstic formations that are key to adult survival throughout the summer. Furthermore, we suggest that the spatial distribution of limestone bedrock also determines large-scale inter-population connectivity, and may explain the observed genetic differentiation among populations, as well as the southernmost limit of the species' global distribution.

J	Wu, L; Liu, X; Yu, Y; Ma, XY				Wu, Lei; Liu, Xia; Yu, Yang; Ma, Xiaoyi			Biochar, grass, and cross-ridge reshaped the surface runoff nitrogen under consecutive rainstorms in loessial sloping lands	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Many options for reducing nitrogen (N) losses from agriculture rely on changing the surface pathways of N runoff in one way or another, but the runoff N mechanism by agricultural interventions such as biochar, grass, and cross-ridge is not well understood. Herein, 12 artificial simulated rainstorms by three biochars (0%, 3%, and 6%), two planting modes (conventional flat planting, cross-ridge), and two underlying surfaces (bare, grass) were designed to investigate the surface pathways of N loss and possible tradeoffs in loessial sloping lands under 60 mm.h(-1) rainfall intensity. Results indicate that: (i) 3% and 6% biochar application can aggravate soil erosion on bare slope, but planting grass on 0% or 3% biochar bare slope has good reduction effects on sediment and N loss, while 6% belongs to excessive biochar on grassed slopes. (ii) Grass planting may decrease the loss fractions of particulate nitrogen (PN) more obviously than bare slope because it decreases the kinetic energy of raindrops, slows the rate of water flow, and improves the shear strength of soils with deep penetrating roots. Configuring cross-ridge with 0% or 3% biochar on grassed slope can reduce PN fraction obviously but the interception of cross-ridge on bare slope is limited and easy to fail. (iii) The hydrological pathways transporting various N fractions vary greatly owing to the interaction of biochar, grass, and cross-ridge. Runoff N from 10 degrees, 15 degrees, and 20 degrees bare slope materializes mainly in particulate fractions (65.58%, 50.15%, and 60.46%), while from grassed slope it occurs mainly in dissolved fractions (54.01%, 59.50%, and 66.48%). These findings may help provide new insights needed to enhance soil health and maintain agroecosystem sustainability through decreasing N losses via sloping farmland management in loess hilly and gully regions.

Therefore, carbon wet deposition and rainfall-runoff processes were examined, as well as carbon fluxes and sources in water in the Xiangxi River watershed, a typical subtropical forested watershed in China. Wet deposition of carbon amounted to 1.31 x 10(4) kg km(-2) between June 2015 and May 2016 (inclusive). The concentration of measured forms of carbon in rainwater of single rainfall event peaked in summer, when the concentration of dissolved total carbon (DTC) was 16.5 mg L-1. In 2016, rainfall-runoff amounted to 7440 kg km(-2), accounting for about 57% of the carbon wet deposition in the watershed. The forest ecosystem in the watershed was found to be a carbon sink every month of the year, with net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) in 2016 of -5.11 x 10(5) kg C km(-2), and monthly NEE was lowest in July (- 8.93 x 10(4) kg C km(-2)). The C-13/C-12 ratio in dissolved inorganic carbon in the river water, relative to Pee Dee Belemnite (delta C-13(DIC)), was higher in the dry season (range, -12.00 to -9.70 parts per thousand; mean, -11.0 parts per thousand) than in the rainy season (range, -14.00 to -12.20 parts per thousand; mean, -12.90 parts per thousand), and higher in downstream reaches (mean values in winter and spring: -10.45 and -12.35 parts per thousand, respectively) than in upstream and middle reaches (-10.63 and -13.30 parts per thousand, -11.63 and -12.87 parts per thousand). In addition, atmospheric precipitation made the highest contributions to the C concentration in the river water in spring and winter (48.6 and 43.2%, respectively).

Insitu monitoring of soil erosion at high altitudes is extremely difficult and challenging due to harsh environmental conditions. This study examines the in-situ effects of different mixed cultivated grassland on runoff and sediment yield through runoff plots. The results showed that the cultivated grasslands could increase 41.5%-175.9% runoff and reduce 51.2%-58.8% sediment concentration compared to bare land. The combination of rhizomatic type (Poa pratensis L.cv. Qinghai) and dense-plexus type (Deschampsia cespitosa) cultivated grasslands appears an effective approach to prevent soil erosion on extremely degraded grassland. The aboveground characteristics and root system of plants determined rainwater movement in the soil and shifted the runoff and sediment in cultivated grassland community. Our findings indicate that plant morphological characteristics should be considered when alleviating soil erosion in the early stage of cultivated grassland in alpine areas. These results provide a new insight into vegetation restoration and soil and water conservation in alpine areas.

Alpine meadow and alpine steppe are the primary rangeland ecosystem types on the QTP. However, the vegetation trends of the two land cover types and the underlying mechanisms behind their variation remain under debate. In this study, we used Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) 3g Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (i.e., GIMMS NDVI3g) by coupling the Breaks for Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) model and the Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) model to analyze alpine meadow and alpine steppe vegetation trends on the QTP between 1982 and 2015. We also assessed vegetation variation response to climatic and anthropogenic indicators in conjunction with climatic and human footprint datasets. Results show that growing season NDVI (GSNDVI) values increased overall for both alpine meadow (0.0001 year-1, p = 0.33) and alpine steppe (0.0002 year-1, p < 0.05) throughout 1982-2015. Significant greening trends in both alpine meadow (0.0007 year-1; p < 0.05) and alpine steppe (0.0005 year-1; p < 0.05) ecosystems were obtained before 1998 and 2001, respectively. However, browning trends ascertained by GSNDVI (-0.0006 year-1; p = 0.12) in alpine meadows were observed throughout 1998-2015, while greening trends ascertained by GSNDVI (0.0002 year-1; p = 0.12) in alpine steppes were observed throughout during 2001-2015. Opposing trends in precipitation, solar radiation, and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) occurred before and after breakpoints in both ecosystems. For the alpine meadow ecosystem, adverse precipitation trends caused browning before 1998 followed by greening after 1998 in the Three-RiverSource National Park (TNP). Conversely, opposing changes in precipitation, solar radiation, and SPEI resulted in greening before 1998 followed by browning after 1998 in southern Tibet and the southeastern QTP. Alpine meadow vegetation trends were generally dominated by solar radiation before 1998 and jointly by precipitation and solar radiation after 1998. Prior to 2001 variation in alpine steppe greenness was controlled by precipitation, while after 2001 solar radiation dominated. Along with an increase in human footprint pressure (HFP) gradients, greenness trends gradually increased before 1998 but reversed after 1998 in the alpine meadow ecosystem. Additionally, greenness trends gradually decreased before 2001 but remained unchanged after 2001 for the alpine steppe ecosystem. These results highlight the different effects that climate change and anthropogenic disturbances have had on alpine meadow and alpine steppe ecosystems on the QTP over different time frames.

Although many studies have been conducted on this topic, we still have little understanding of how N deposition affects soil C pools and GHG budgets at the global scale. We synthesized a comprehensive dataset of 275 sites from multiple terrestrial ecosystems around the world and quantified the responses of the global soil C pool and GHG fluxes induced by N enrichment. The results showed that the soil organic C concentration and the soil CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions increased by an average of 3.7%, 0.3%, 24.3% and 91.3% under N enrichment, respectively, and that the soil CH4 uptake decreased by 6.0%. Furthermore, the percentage increase in N2O emissions (91.3%) was two times lower than that (215%) reported by Liu and Greaver (Ecology Letters, 2009, 12:1103-1117). There was also greater stimulation of soil C pools (15.70 kg C ha(-1) year(-1) per kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) than previously reported under N deposition globally. The global N deposition results showed that croplands were the largest GHG sources (calculated as CO2 equivalents), followed by wetlands. However, forests and grasslands were two important GHG sinks. Globally, N deposition increased the terrestrial soil C sink by 6.34 Pg CO2/year. It also increased net soil GHG emissions by 10.20 Pg CO2-Geq (CO2 equivalents)/year. Therefore, N deposition not only increased the size of the soil C pool but also increased global GHG emissions, as calculated by the global warming potential approach.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014	Kim, Dong-Gill/0000-0003-3084-2658													1354-1013	1365-2486				APR	2020	26	4					2613	2629		10.1111/gcb.14970	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14970		JAN 2020						31863618					WOS:000509605300001

Identifying spatial process relationships can be challenging due to overlapping of underlying processes at different scales. The objective of this study was to evaluate noise-assisted multivariate empirical mode decomposition (NA-MEMD) for characterizing Ks variability and depicting its scale-dependent relationships with different soil properties and environmental factors. At an interval of 10 km along an 860-km south-north transect across the Loess Plateau of China, Ks, bulk density, soil organic carbon content, sand and clay contents at three depths of 0 to 10, 10 to 20 and 20 to 40 cm were investigated as well as four environmental factors of elevation, slope gradient, annual precipitation and temperature. Decomposed into different intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and residues by NA-MEMD, Ks at all depths were found to vary at the smallest scale of 29 km mainly, corresponding to IMF1s, which manifested 33.0 to 48.1% of the total Ks variance. The small-scale variations of Ks reflected not only in IMF1s but also in IMF2s and IMF3s were dominated by soil properties especially bulk density, and the large-scale variations corresponding to IMF4s and IMF5s were controlled by environmental factors in general. For each depth, Ks at the scale of investigation was estimated by adding all the IMFs and residue derived from the factor components at equivalent scales using multiple linear regression (MLR). Such Ks estimations after NA-MEMD evidently outperformed the MLR before NA-MEMD by explaining additional 9.4 to 18.7% of the total Ks variance, but underper-formed the artificial neural network and state-space approach also implemented on undecomposed spatial series of Ks and its underlying factors. NA-MEMD serves as a useful tool for Ks characterization and its incorporation with non-linear functions or spatial interactions with impact factors is suggested for the estimation of Ks and other soil processes.

Interception and use efficiency of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were estimated in relay grass pea under different nutrient management schedules in consecutive two crop seasons of 2017-2018 and 2018-2019. Treatments were two levels of seed priming (i.e., 1. S-1 : Without seed priming and 2. S-2: Seed priming with ammonium molybdate at 0.5 g kg(-1) seed) and five levels of foliar-applied nutritions with various combinations of 2% Urea and 0.5% NPK (19:19:19) shuffling their times of application, replicated thrice laying out in a factorial randomized block design. Seed priming along with twice sprays of NPK (19:19:19) at pre-flowering followed by a second one after 15 days recorded maximum leaf area index (LAI) and total chlorophyll content augmenting greater interception and use efficiency of PAR with highest biomass accumulation, crop growth rate (CGR) and leaf nutrient contents leading to a significant increase in seed yield over control (1696.70 and 1182.00 kg ha(-1), respectively) in a pooled analysis. LAI and total chlorophyll content established linear relationships with PAR interception explaining about 94 and 88% variations in intercepted PAR at 90 DAS. Intercepted PAR during different phenophases was positively correlated to dry matter accumulation and net photosynthetic rate with polynomial relationships. Seed yield of grass pea varied about 95 and 96% respectively during 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 with the variations in PAR interception at the pod developmental stage.

The soil nematode metabolic carbon footprint, based on nematode biomass and respiration, can be used to indicate ecosystem function and the response of nematodes to nutrient enrichment in the ecosystem. However, it is unclear whether or how climate warming and litter removal affect the metabolic carbon footprint of soil nematodes and soil food webs. In this study, we investigated four warming and litter removal treatments in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China, to determine the effects of climate warming and litter removal on soil microbial food webs. The treatments included: (1) control (CK), (2) warming, (3) litter removal, (4) warming + litter removal. We found that warming and litter removal had significant negative effects on the diversity and richness of soil nematodes. In addition, our results showed warming indirectly and directly affected vegetation diversity, thereby altering soil nematode diversity. Vegetation played an important role in the maintenance of soil nematode community diversity. The enrichment and structural footprints reflected nematodes that could respond most rapidly to resource enrichment and those with higher trophic levels in soil food webs, respectively. Overall, warming and litter removal significantly negatively affect the enrichment metabolic footprint, indicating they could significantly reduce the external resource inputs into the food web. Both warming and litter removal reduced the structural metabolic footprint of the soil food web, although the changes were not significant, indicating that the metabolic activity of nematodes of high nutrient levels decreased and the ability to regulate the food web from top-bottom effects was weakened under warming and litter removal. The nematode functional metabolic footprints indicated that litter removal could aggravate the effect of warming on the soil food web and result in more severe degradation. The combination of warming and litter removal significantly inhibited the connectance of the bacterial channel, but had no significant effect on the fungal channel. These results suggest that the soil food web enhanced resistance to the environment by increasing the proportion of the fungal channel. It is critical to understand the responses of soil food webs to climate warming and litter removal to better predict how ecosystem functions will change in the future.					li, xiang/JCN-9316-2023; wang, wenjuan/JGD-0428-2023; li, bai/JNE-1502-2023; chen, wenjing/IZE-8536-2023	WANG, jie/0009-0004-1824-7244													0016-7061	1872-6259				NOV 1	2021	401								115318	10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115318	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115318		JUN 2021											WOS:000667306700025

Both slope length and slope gradient are potentially sensitive to spatial resolution when calculated in a GIS framework. The resolution effect on the LS factor and approaches suitable for improving the LS factor at a coarse resolution have not been well identified. To address this problem, the LS factor at 5-m and 30-m resolution in twenty-four watersheds with various terrains was estimated. And a downscale model based on matching of the lower resolution LS cumulative frequency curves to a higher resolution ("Histogram Matching" method) was tested for its potential to improve LS factor estimation accuracy. In the larger relief mountainous area, compared to 5-m resolution, the 30-m resolution generated LS was generally overestimated by more than 20% and in lower relief areas underestimated by more than 15%. This bias is less than 10% in medium relief areas. The downscale model improved LS factor estimates compared to the 30-m resolution estimate by more than 10% when comparing frequency distribution curves and more than 20% in mean values in larger relief areas. The downscale model worked well in all regions except for the low relief areas, which intuitively are the low soil erosion potential areas. The results of this research help quantify the uncertainty in soil erosion estimates and may ultimately help to improve the assessment of soil erosion through its impact on LS factor estimates, especially at regional and global scales.

After fermentation, the microbes and metabolites are changed. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, untargeted metabolomics, and 16 S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer sequencing were used to study metabolites and microorganisms in pre-fermented tea and Fu brick tea fermented for 6 months. Among the seven flavor-related metabolites detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, only epigallocatechin significantly increased, which can be used as a marker metabolite of Fu brick tea. In total, 292 differentially accumulated metabolites were obtained using untargeted metabolomics, and they were mainly enriched in gingerol biosynthesis and other health-related metabolic pathways. Eurotium cristatum, which accounted for more than 99% of all fungi, and gamma-Proteobacteria may be used as the signature microorganisms of Fu brick tea. Correlation analysis showed that 2-formylglutarate was the metabolite with the strongest correlation with Aspergillaceae and was of great significance for fermentation. In the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway, microorganisms and metabolites were significantly enriched. The changes in metabolites and microbes in pre-fermented tea and Fu brick tea provide important information for analyzing the interactions between microbes and metabolites and improving the characteristics of Fu brick tea.																			0023-6438	1096-1127				MAY 1	2023	181								114775	10.1016/j.lwt.2023.114775	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2023.114775		APR 2023											WOS:001055181000001

However, the changes of genes that encoding enzymes for plant- and microbial-derived carbon decomposition along environmental gradients remains unclear.MethodsWe used metagenomic sequencing to explore changes in genes encoding enzymes for carbon decomposition in five forest sites along an elevational gradient (1503-3182 m) on Qinling Mountain, China.ResultsThe genes encoding CAZymes showed various patterns along the elevational gradient. In particular, the abundance of genes encoding auxiliary enzymes and glycoside hydrolases decreased with increasing elevation. The abundance of genes encoding enzymes for plant- and fungi-derived carbon decomposition was higher at low elevations than at high elevations, whereas the abundance of genes encoding enzymes for bacteria-derived carbon decomposition was higher at high elevations than at low elevations. The results indicate contrasting patterns of fungal- and bacterial-derived carbon decomposition with elevation. Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria were the dominant species that decomposed dead plant and microbial biomass. Moreover, our results reveal that soil properties (i.e., ammonium nitrogen and bulk density) and vegetation properties dominated the CAZymes gene distribution along the elevational gradient.ConclusionBacteria- and fungi-derived carbon decomposition potentials show contrasting elevational patterns in forest soils; soil and vegetation properties are common controls for the elevational patterns.

These uses raise the agricultural demand for low quality water. To provide appropriate management techniques for safely using saline water, different mulching materials were tested on ridge-tillage tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). Four treatments: control (bare land, CK), black plastic (BPM), black sheet net (BSN), and wheat straw (SM) were designed to: (i) evaluate the effects of mulching on the irrigation amount, soil salinity, tomato yield, and irrigation water productivity (IWP); and (ii) develop integrated irrigation strategies using saline water securely. The average required water for the SM and BPM treatments reduced by 12 and 20%, respectively. Electrical conductivity of saturated paste extracts (ECe) increased from 1.91 to 4.07 dS m(-1) in 0- to 40-cm root zone and from 2.33 to 4.24 dS m(-1) in 0- to 120-cm soil profile after the first year irrigation, and then fluctuated slightly during the next 3 yr due to precipitation and evaporation. The ECe for the SM treatment was always the least in 4 yr. Compared with CK, the BPM and SM treatments over 4 yr increased the average tomato yield by 26 and 42%, and increased the average IWP by 62 and 70%, respectively. Therefore, straw mulching was the best mulching material to safely use saline water of <6.3 dS m(-1) for the ridge-tillage tomato under drip irrigation, followed by black plastic mulching, in a temperate semi humid monsoon climate zone.																			0002-1962	1435-0645				JUL-AUG	2019	111	4					2116	2127		10.2134/agronj2018.09.0620	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2018.09.0620													WOS:000476472300056

Building soil organic carbon (SOC) is proposed as a key strategy for climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, practices that increase SOC may also increase nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and impact crop yields and on-farm income. A comprehensive assessment of the effects of different management practices on trade-offs between GHG emissions and agricultural systems profitability under climate change is needed. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to: (1) analyze the long-term trends of SOC and N2O emissions, and ascertain whether the croplands of the study region are net GHG sources or sinks under climate change; (2) quantify the GHG abatement on a gross margin basis; (3) identify effective management practices that could achieve a win-win strategy; and (4) investigate sources of uncertainty in estimates of GHG emissions and gross margins under climate change. METHODS: APSIM was used to simulate the effects of three crop residue retention rates (10%, 50% and 100%), and six representative crop rotations (wheat-canola, wheat-field pea-wheat-canola, wheat-field pea-wheat-oats, wheat-wheat-barley, wheat-wheat-canola, and wheat-wheat-oats) under two Shared Socio-economic Pathways scenarios (SSP245 and SSP585) using climate projections from 27 GCMs. GHG emissions and gross margins from 1961 to 2092 were assessed across 204 study sites in southeastern Australia. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that residue retention can turn the soil from a carbon source (10% retention, 304-450 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1)) to a carbon sink (100% retention,-269 similar to-57 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) yr(-1)), and the potential of carbon sequestration was partly offset by concomitantly increased N2O emissions. The wheat-wheat-canola rotation with full residue retention was shown to be a win-win solution with both large potential of GHG abatement and high gross margin compared with other rotations. Spatial analysis showed that the southeastern part of the study region, with higher rainfall, had higher gross margins, while the drier northwestern part had greater GHG emission reduction potentials. Although climate change led to increased GHG emissions and decreased yields for some crops, these adverse effects were overweighed by the higher SOC and yield advantages from full residue retention. SIGNIFICANCE: This study emphasizes the significant potential for agronomic management to maximize gross margin and reduce GHG emissions under climate change in southeast Australia. Results from this study could be used by farmers and policymakers to mitigate climate change without compromising agroecosystem profitability.

The genetic diversity among 135 onion individuals, belonging to 23 accessions, was evaluated using microsatellite (SSR) markers and phenotypic information. A total of 35 alleles were generated with 11 SSRs. The polymorphic information content (PIC) value ranged from 0.08 to 0.95, with an average PIC of 0.43. The expected heterozygosity averaged 0.37, and the observed heterozygosity averaged 0.42. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that 79% of genetic variation existed within individuals. Structure and cluster analysis grouped the accessions into two major clusters: landraces and pre-breeding lines. For the phenotypic traits evaluated, field trials were conducted in two different environments. Significant differences among accessions were shown, and for most traits, there was also a significant environmental effect and a significant interaction between environment and accession. Great variability was found for all the traits that could be exploited to create new varieties of onion adapted to local conditions by selecting appropriate parents in hybridization breeding.

We examined: 1) the nutritive quality of ENRS; 2) in vitro rumen fermentation parameters and microbiota composition with ENRS as substrate; and, 3) serum metabolites and average daily gain (ADG) of growing Hu lambs consuming ENRS. Ensiling of rice straw increased in vitro neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) degradabilities (both P < 0.05), and total gas production (P < 0.05) but decreased (P < 0.05) methane (CH4) production. In addition, ensiling increased bacterial diversity and reduced the relative abundance of the methanogen Methanobrevibacter. Twelve male Hu lambs (initial live body weight = 25.2 & PLUSMN; 0.47 kg), aged 70 ( & PLUSMN; 6) days, were assigned randomly to one of two groups (n = 6) and offered a total mixed ration (TMR) that included 400 g/kg DM of either RS or ENRS for 4 weeks. Ensiling ruptured the physical structure of the RS, decreased (P < 0.05) dry matter and hemicellulose contents, and increased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of lactate, acetate and organic acids. Feeding ENRS up-regulated purine metabolism and improved ADG and gain to feed ratio of Hu lambs when compared to RS. In summary, ensiling was effective in improving both the nutritive quality of the feed and ADG of the lambs.

However, its effect on sheep is unknown. To fill this gap, we examined the effects of supplementary FNT on serum biochemistry and the rumen bacteria in Hu rams. The results demonstrated that FNT could improve the immunity of sheep and increase the relative abundance of beneficial rumen bacteria. However, the rumen fermentation variables were not altered with supplementary FNT. The fruit of Nitraria tangutorum (FNT) is reputed to possess medicinal properties; however, its effect on sheep (Ovis aries) is unknown. The aim of this study was to fill this gap. In a 3 x 3 Latin square design, six 12-month-old rumen-fistulated Hu rams (56.2 +/- 8.26 kg; mean +/- SD) were penned individually and offered one of three levels of FNT, namely, 0 g/d (control; CON), 16 g/d (N-16), and 48 g/d (N-48). The concentration of serum immunoglobulin G increased linearly (p = 0.03) with an increasing intake of FNT. The serum concentration of beta-hydroxybutyrate in the N-48 group was lower than in the CON group (p = 0.01) and decreased linearly with increasing FNT (p = 0.001). The concentration of serum lactate dehydrogenase tended to decrease (p = 0.07) linearly with an increase in FNT intake, while the concentration of glucose did not differ among groups (p = 0.14) but displayed a quadratic curve with an increase in FNT (p = 0.05). The rumen concentration of lipase decreased linearly with increasing FNT (p = 0.04). The rumen fermentation variables were not affected by FNT. The FNT intake increased the abundance of beneficial ruminal bacteria, such as Lachnoclostridium, Rhodocyclaceae, and Candidatus Arthromitus. Prevotella, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Ruminococcus, Olsenella, Lachnospiraceae_NK3A20_group, and Quinella were the dominant bacterial genera in all treatments. We conclude that FNT can improve immunity and increase the relative abundance of beneficial ruminal bacteria in sheep.					wang, wenjuan/JGD-0428-2023	Degen, Allan/0000-0003-4563-6195; Cheng, Xindong/0000-0001-7760-1654													2076-2615					NOV	2022	12	22							3211	10.3390/ani12223211	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani12223211								36428439					WOS:000887013400001

We examined 6 Altay (A) and 6 Hu (H) six-month-old ewe lambs. Altay sheep are raised in northern China and are adapted to dry, cold climates, while Hu sheep are raised in southern China and are adapted to warm, humid climates. Each breed was divided into two groups: chronic cold sheep, exposed to -5 degrees C for 25 days (3 A(C); 3 H(C)), and thermo-neutral sheep, maintained at 20 degrees C (3 A(w); 3 H-w). The transcriptome profiles of hypothalamus, tail-fat and perirenal fat tissues from these four groups were determined using paired-end sequencing for RNA expression analysis. There are differences in cold tolerance between Hu and Altay sheep. Under cold exposure of the lambs: (1) UCP1-dependent thermogenesis and calcium- and cAMP-signaling pathways were activated; and (2) different fat tissues were activated in Hu and Altay lambs. Several candidate genes involved in thermogenesis including UCP1, ADRB3, ADORA2A, ATP2A1, RYR1 and IP6K1 were identified. Molecular mechanisms of thermogenesis in the sheep are discussed and new avenues for research are suggested.

Improper agri-waste management causes environmental pollution which resulted in economic losses and human health-related problems. Hence, there is an urgent need to design and develop eco-friendly, cost-effective, and socially acceptable agriwaste management technologies. Agri-waste has high energy conversion efficiency as compared to fossil fuelbased energy generation materials. Agri-waste can potentially be exploited for the production of secondgeneration biofuels. However, composted agri-waste can be an alternative to energy-intensive chemical fertilizers in organic production systems. Furthermore, value-added agri-waste can be a potential feedstock for livestock and industrial products. But comprehensive information concerning agri-waste management is lacking in the literature. Therefore, the present study reviewed the latest advancements in efficient agri-waste management technologies. This latest review will help the researchers and policy planners to formulate environmentally robust residue management practices for achieving a green economy in the agricultural production sector.

The poor availability of nitrogen (N) and P in soils often restricts crop growth. However, the effects of P addition on plant growth and plant nutrient transport changes during the establishment of Leymus chinensis fields in Xinjiang are not clear. We investigated the responses of Leymus chinensis biomass and nutrient absorption and utilization to changes in soil N and P by adding P (0, 15.3, 30.6, and 45.9 kg P ha(-1) year(-1)) with basally applied N fertilizer (150 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)). The results showed that (a) Principal component analysis (PCA) of biomass, nutrient accumulation, soil available P, and soil available N during the different periods of Leymus chinensis growth showed that their cumulative contributions during the jointing and harvest periods reached 95.4% and 88%, respectively. (b) Phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) increased with the increase of P fertilizer gradient and then decreased and the maximum PUE was 13.14% under moderate P addition. The accumulation of biomass and nutrients in Leymus chinensis can be effectively improved by the addition of P fertilizer at 30.6 kg ha(-1). Different P additions either moderately promoted or excessively inhibited Leymus chinensis growth and nutrient utilization.																			2045-2322					APR 6	2023	13	1							5660	10.1038/s41598-023-31402-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31402-4								37024558					WOS:001039063700007

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Amla fruit powder supplementation on antioxidant capacity, immune response, and gut microbial diversity of preweaning dairy calves. Supplementation of Amla fruit powder at 5 g per day improved the antioxidant capacity and immune response of preweaning dairy calves, while higher doses (20 and 40 g per day) negatively affected the antioxidant capacity and immune response. Ten grams per day supplementation showed comparable results to the control. Thus, 5 g per day Amla supplementation could be recommended for preweaning dairy calves. Disease is the main reason for the use of antimicrobials in calf rearing, and antibiotics are commonly used to treat calves, including for unknown diseases. This leads to antimicrobial resistance, which is a challenge to the livestock industry and public health. Plant products containing high levels of phytochemicals may improve the immunity and resistance of calves against infections, thereby reducing the use of antimicrobials. This study aimed to investigate the effect of Phyllanthus emblica (Amla) fruit powder (PE) supplementation on antioxidant capacity and immune response of preweaning dairy calves. One hundred, 2-day-old, male Holstein calves were randomly assigned into five treatment groups receiving 0, 5, 10, 20, and 40 g/d PE supplementation. Antioxidant and immune indices and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were analyzed from serum samples, whereas 16S rRNA was analyzed from rumen fluid and fecal samples. PE supplementation, at 5 g/d, protected calves against oxidative stress and improved antioxidant enzymes and immune and anti-inflammatory responses, showing its immunity-enhancing and protective roles against infections. However, the antioxidant capacity and immune response decreased with increasing PE levels, illustrating the adverse effects of PE supplementation at higher doses. The analysis of ruminal and fecal bacterial community abundance detected higher proportions of Firmicutes at an early age, and a higher Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio at weaning, in calves supplemented with 5 g/d PE. This contributed to the development of the immune system in early life, and improved immune and anti-inflammatory responses at a later age. The overall results suggest that PE could be supplemented at 5 g/d for preweaning dairy calves to protect against oxidative stress and infections while maintaining normal gut microbial hemostasis.

AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Green manure is a widely applied to increase grain yield, while it also attributes to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agriculture ecosystems. Combining green manure with inorganic fertilizer inputs is a common practice that can influence soil GHG emissions and grain yield, however, its impacts on grain yield and global warming potential (GWP) under different initial soil conditions before rotating experiments and agronomic management in paddy fields remain unclear. We synthesized 508 data pairs to evaluate the responses of CO2 emissions, CH4 emissions, N2O emissions, and grain yield to combined inputs of green manure plus inorganic fertilizer compared with only inorganic fertilizer application. Our findings indicate that both inorganic fertilizer plus extra green manure (GM-E) and green manure substitutes for inorganic fertilizer (GM-S) could increase CO2 emissions (22.5 %-76.8 %), CH4 emissions (100 %-103 %), N2O emissions (29.8 %-50.9 %), and yield (2.21 %-19.6 %). Except for GM-E, which showed a non-significant increase in grain yield. The initial soil properties before rotating experiments, the types and timing of green manure application were key drivers of GHG emissions and yield, and extra green manure applied in areas with low initial soil pH and high C:N can increase GWP and yield. Overall, the mixed green manure application had greater impact than leguminous or non-leguminous green manure applied alone. The responses of GHG emissions and yield to GM-S were modulated by mean annual precipitation and initial soil properties before rotating experiments, and green manure substitutes for inorganic fertilizer in areas with high initial soil pH and low C:N can increase GWP and yield. Meanwhile, excessive precipitation caused a reduction in yield and a significant increase in GWP intensity. Our results showed that extra green manure applications of less than 68.1 kg N ha-1 would not significantly increase GWP. Therefore, an effective green manure strategy can achieve a win-win situation for the dual challenge of agricultural production and climate change mitigation.

A factorial design consisting of two N rates [adequate-N (AN) and low-N (LN)] and four water treatments [well-watered (WW), horizontally partial root-zone drought (H-PRD), vertically partial root-zone drought (V-PRD) and full root-zone drought (FRD)] was used. On the whole, the effects of nitrogen applications on seedling growth, physiological parameters and gene expression of key genes may vary among different water treatments. For example, A, E, gs and CO2int were significantly increased under WW and V-PRD conditions while A and WUEi were decreased under FRD by N addition. As compared with the sharp stoma closure under FRD, stoma was moderately regulated under H-PRD and V-PRD conditions by triggering a network of signaling including phytohormones, NO and Ca2+. Despite the more sensitive drought responses under H-PRD, the intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) was higher under VPRD, mainly due to the homeostasis of abscisic acid (ABA) signals. The higher WUEi and the efficient carbohydrate production contributed to the dominant xylem development under V-PRD. In contrast, the constitutive activation of ABA signaling over long-term H-PRD reduced WUEi and thus suppressed stem growth under H-PRD.

Moreover, N application increased IAA levels and the transcription of critical PIPs genes, which contributed to the dominant WUEi and xylem development under V-PRD conditions.

Biological Control of Lepidopteran Pests in Rice: A Multi-Nation Case Study From Asia	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT												We provide a case study where Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for rice production systems has been introduced to the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). Funded by the European Union (EU), this IPM initiative brought together local and international partners to develop an environmentally friendly and economically sustainable rice pest management strategy for southwestern China, Laos, and Myanmar. A key component of the strategy was to establish 12 Trichogramma spp. rearing facilities (TRFs) that mainly targeted rice stem borers. Four TRFs were established in each of the participating countries. The most promising strains of Trichogramma chilonis (Ishii) and T. japonicus (Ashmead) were selected for production in theTRFs based on extensive field surveys as well as laboratory and field release studies. The project also considered the potential for Trichogramma spp. of each strain to withstand the high temperatures expected under a changing climate. Implementation of the IPM strategy resulted in higher rice yields (2-10%), an increase in natural enemy abundance (e.g., twice as many spiders), and a reduction in insecticide applications (1.5 fewer applications). During a capacity-building program, IPM practices with strong cultural and biological control-based components were promoted among ca 50 IPM trainers and ca 6,400 rice farmers.This case study indicates the potential successes of advanced biological control-based IPM systems. We believe that these systems merit wider consideration, including adaptations for other regions and crops.

However, they have adapted well and even thrive under these conditions. The aim of the present study was to gain insight into how the rumen epithelium of Tibetan sheep has adapted to the consumption of low-energy-level diets. For this purpose, we compared Tibetan and small-tailed Han sheep (n 24 of each breed, all wethers and 1 center dot 5 years of age), which were divided randomly into one of four groups and offered ad libitum diets of different digestible energy (DE) densities: 8 center dot 21, 9 center dot 33, 10 center dot 45 and 11 center dot 57 MJ DE/kg DM. The Tibetan sheep had higher rumen concentrations of total SCFA, acetate, butyrate and iso-acids but lower concentrations of propionate than small-tailed Han sheep. The Tibetan sheep had higher absorption capability of SCFA due to the greater absorption surface area and higher mRNA expression of the SCFA absorption relative genes than small-tailed Han sheep. For the metabolism of SCFA in the rumen epithelium, the small-tailed Han sheep showed higher utilisation of the ketogenesis pathway than Tibetan sheep; however, Tibetan sheep had greater regulation capacity in SCFA metabolism pathways. These differences between breeds allowed the Tibetan sheep to have greater capability of absorbing SCFA and better capacity to regulate the metabolism of SCFA, which would allow them to cope with low energy intake better than small-tailed Han sheep.

ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Sloping farmland is widely distributed in Chinese loess hilly regions but the coupling mechanism between slope gradient and sediment yield was not clear in a large-scale ecological restoration watershed. A piecewise sediment delivery ratio (SDR) algorithm was embedded in the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to identify the spatiotemporal responses of sediment yield to slope gradient before and after "Grain for Green" project in the Yanhe River Watershed. Results indicate that (i) The sediment yield rate in the Yanhe River Watershed varied greatly from 1995 to 2012 but it presented an overall decreasing trend especially after 2006, the average sediment yield rate was 1013.3 t.km(-2) from 2009 to 2012, which decreased by 80.7% compared with the early stage of "Grain for Green" project (1995-1998). The high risk regions of sediment yield were mainly concentrated in the sloping farmlands located at the main stream banks of Yanhe River. (ii) The contribution ratio of steeper slope under each sediment yield rate increased gradually with increased sediment yield rate in 1995, while only the contribution ratio of 15 degrees similar to 20 degrees slope presented a significant increasing trend in 2010. (iii) The slope classification of the highest contribution ratio transferred from 0 degrees similar to 15 degrees to 15 degrees similar to 20 degrees when the sediment yield rate was > 30 t.ha(-1) in 1995, but 15 degrees similar to 20 degrees always dominated the key contribution of sediment yield under each sediment yield rate in 2010. Results could provide new understanding for reasonable soil conservation planning and management of sloping farmland in loess hilly regions.					wu, lei/D-3286-2017; Wu, Lei/JDC-4172-2023; Ma, Xiaoyi/HJH-6205-2023	wu, lei/0000-0002-5602-674X; 													0925-8574	1872-6992				JAN	2020	142								105630	10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.105630	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.105630													WOS:000497646800005

Recently, the decline in central Asian terrestrial water storage (TWS) has threatened the health of local ecosystems. Therefore, it is of great significance to adopt an efficient approach to explore and identify the nonlinear relationship between two important indicators, i.e., the TWSA and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the arid central Asian endorheic basins. In this study, we analysed the long-term trends of the TWSA and NDVI, and identified the lag month (1 month) as the optimal moving window of the nonlinear Granger causality test embedded in random forest to detect the nonlinear NDVI change response of NDVI changes in vegetation to the TWSA from 2003 to 2015. There are decreasing trends in TWSAs over approximately 81.7% of the study area and the NDVI generally decreased resulting in approximately 36% vegetation browning in the study area. The nonlinear Granger uni-directional causes of the TWSA were responsible for 97.9% of the NDVI variation in the study area considering the optimal response time for moving windows. The causes of vegetation browning in the central Asian Aral Sea basin and vegetation greening in the basins of Northwest China could be mostly explained by the changes in TWS. Our findings contribute to understanding the nonlinear causal linkages between vegetation and the TWSA in endorheic basins, and these findings provide insights for obtaining terrestrial water consumption patterns and water resource management under the joint influence of climate change and human activities.					, Ping/ACH-8897-2022	, Ping/0000-0003-2481-9953; Yu, Zongxu/0000-0002-2973-0475													1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2023	154								110901	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110901	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110901		SEP 2023											WOS:001077427000001

However, a systematic analysis of previous studies indicates that there are large gaps in our knowledge regarding the spatial patterns of soil P due to the lack of sufficient field observations, especially at larger scales. Thus, we explored the spatial patterns of soil total P (TP) and Olsen-available P (AP) in the Hexi Corridor, which is an important commodity grain base for China where large quantities of chemical P fertilizers were applied. We analyzed the spatial variability of soil P using semivariogram and Anselin Local Moran's I analysis at the regional and local scales. We explored the driving factors that influence the variances in soil P using principal component regression and Johnson's relative weights. Overall, soil TP was at a "low" level (0.55 g/kg in 0-20 cm and 0.49 g/kg in 20-40 cm) and AP was at the "lowest" level (2.54 mg/kg in 0-20 cm and 1.73 mg/kg in 20-40 cm). The soil TP and AP levels tended to be similar within land use types and they varied according to the following decreasing order: farmland > grassland > forestland > bare land. The soil TP and AP both exhibited strong spatial dependence (nugget ratio = 4.4-8.0%) within large ranges (132.0-222.0 km). At the local scale, Anselin Local Moran's I analysis indicated the existence of some clusters and outlier areas, and land use determined the local disparities in the soil P contents. Ordinary kriging (OK) interpolation was used to obtain unbiased estimates of the soil TP content (mean absolute error (MAE) < 0.002 g/kg) and AP content (MAE = 0.027 mg/kg), but the predictions of the soil P at local positions were not satisfactory, where the normalized root mean square error varied from 78.8 to 84.8%. Land use and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were major factors that contributed to the spatial variability in the soil P. These results indicate severe P limitation in the northwestern China and land use dominates the spatial variability of soil P at both local and regional scales. Our finding provides information that is relevant to assess fertilizer application, soil P predication and vegetation restoration.																			0168-2563	1573-515X				AUG	2021	155	1					59	75		10.1007/s10533-021-00812-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-021-00812-9		JUL 2021											WOS:000668850600003

The contribution of A. saligna in biomass restoration can be quantified using a precise estimation of tree biomass carbon. This study developed species-specific allometric models and evaluated the spatial variation of tree biomass across restored areas in exclosures and open grazing landscapes. These models could play a considerable role in the monitoring of carbon dynamics across A. saligna planation dominated areas. We harvested, excavated, and weighed twenty-one sample trees representing different size classes to develop allometric models for the estimation of aboveground (AGB), belowground (BGB) and total tree (TB) biomass. The average dry-to-fresh mass ratio and the root-to-shoot ratio was 0.47 (+/- 0.13) and 0.28 (+/- 0.14), respectively. Tree biomass significantly correlated with diameter at breast height (r = 0.93; P < 0.001), diameter at stump height (r = 0.88, P < 0.001) and tree height (r = 0.56, P < 0.05). Our best biomass estimation models explained 86%, 82% and 87% of variations in AGB, BGB, and TB, respectively. Models using DSH and DSH & H explained 70%-78% of the variation in AGB, BGB, and TB. Estimated C-stock showed a significant relationship with stem density (R-2= 0.91, P < 0.01). Estimated TB varied between 1.5-18 Mg ha(-1) on grazed land and exclosures. Estimated C-stocks in the exclosure exceeded the estimated C-stock in the open grazing land by similar to 60%. This implies that with proper management practices and enrichment planting A. saligna significantly contributes to increasing carbon accumulation on degraded landscapes, playing a key role in climate change mitigation efforts while improving land productivity.																			2515-7620					DEC 1	2023	5	12							125007	10.1088/2515-7620/ad12e1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2515-7620/ad12e1													WOS:001126496600001

However, quantitative information regarding the flow resistance induced by raindrops impact to sheet flow (& UDelta;f) under the influence of different surface roughnesses is limited. In this study, multiple experimental simulations of rainfall and inflow were conducted on flumes with five unit width inflow discharges ranging from 0.02-0.1 m2 min-1, five rainfall intensities ranging from 40 to 120 mm h-1, and three levels of surface roughnesses ranging from 0.009 to 0.25 mm to identify flow resistance due to raindrop impact under different surfaces. Results showed that surface roughness was able to increase the total flow resistance without raindrop impact (fo) and with raindrop impact (fr), respectively. Under rainfall conditions, raindrop impact was able to increase fr on different surfaces. The surface roughness played a stronger role on contributing the fr than the raindrop impact. The major control of fr was the Reynolds number (Re), and fr decreased with the increasing Re. & UDelta;f were positively affected by surface roughness and rainfall intensity. Rough surface can increase the effects of raindrop impact on water flow by reducing the flow velocity of base flow or inflow, which leads to the increase in & UDelta;f. The major control of & UDelta;f was the Re, and & UDelta;f decreased with Re. Flow resistance induced by raindrop impact was larger for shallower and slower moving sheet flow with the low Re. In addition, a new equation has been developed to predict & UDelta;f under the conditions of Fr < 2.16 by using rainfall intensity, surface roughness, velocity, and water depth. This study helps to estimate the flow resistance induced by raindrops impact to sheet flow under surface roughness and provide the scientific insights for improving hydrologic and soil erosion models.

J.			Effects of level of feed intake and season on digestibility of dietary components, efficiency of microbial protein synthesis, rumen fermentation and ruminal microbiota in yaks	ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Yaks (Poephagus gninniens) are raised under the harsh conditions of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and, traditionally, they graze only natural grasslands all year round without receiving any supplements. The pasture peaks in biomass and quality during the summer when yaks usually gain body weight; however, it is sparse and of poor quality in winter when yaks generally lose body weight. Yaks are well adapted to the extreme conditions and are able to cope with low energy and nitrogen intakes. We hypothesized that the level of feed intake would affect the digestibility of nutrients and the efficiency of microbial protein synthesis (EMPS, as g microbial N/kg organic matter intake) and predicted that at very low dietary intakes in yaks, dietary components would be digested at a higher rate but that there would be little, if any effect on EMPS. We also predicted that the EMPS in yaks would be higher than values reported for cattle. To test these predictions, we offered six yaks a dry matter intake of 0.010 to 0.011 BW (low intake: LI) and six yaks a dry matter intake of 0.020 to 0.021 BW (high intake: HI) both in summer and in winter. Apparent digestibilities of dry matter (DM, P = 0.04), organic matter (OM, P = 0.048) and crude protein (CP, P = 0.04) were greater in the LI yaks than in the HI yaks in winter. The HI group was in positive N balance in summer and in winter, whereas the LI group was in positive N balance in summer, but not in winter. The total volatile fatty acids (TVFA) tended or was greater (P = 0.09 in summer; 0.053 in winter) and estimated microbial N yield was greater (P < 0.001) in the HI than in the LI yaks in both seasons. The EMPS did not differ between seasons (P = 0.51) or between feed levels (P = 0.26) and, in general, was higher in yaks than in cattle. The proportion of Fibrobacter succinogenes, a major fibrolytic ruminal bacterium, was significantly greater in LI than in HI yaks (P = 0.007). We concluded that in yaks: 1) the apparent digestibilities of the dietary components increase at low level dietary intakes in winter when the forage is of poor quality; 2) EMPS does not differ between feed levels and is generally higher in yaks than for reported values in cattle; and 3) the higher digestion of NDF and ADF in the LI yaks than in the HI yaks in winter when the pasture is of poor quality, was due, at least in part, to a greater proportion of ruminal Fibrobacter succinogenes bacterium.

This optical response has immense potential in photocatalytic applications. In this work, KBFO was successfully synthesized using citrate combustion method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) as well as Mossbauer spectroscopic studies, identify the valence state of Iron (Fe) as Fe3+. The strong magneto dielectric coupling in KBFO was demonstrated by integrating both magnetization (M) and dielectric constant (epsilon) characteristics as a function of temperature. Magnetic and dielectric transitions were observed in close proximity in temperature range similar to 780 K-760 K respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the photoelectrochemical properties of as developed KBFO were analyzed for the first time revealing a significant photoresponse with an average photocurrent density of 0.1 mu A cm(-2). The photocatalytic properties of KBFO were investigated by degrading organic effluent methylene blue (MB) under direct sunlight followed by a comparison with the photodegradation performance of perovskite BiFeO3 (BFO). KBFO showed enhanced photocatalytic performance as compared to BFO due to its enhanced structural and optical properties.

The Loess Plateau (LP) suffered from severe land degradation, such as vegetation degradation, soil erosion and desertification. This study assessed land degradation changes by considering different land degradation types including vegetation degradation, soil erosion, aridity, loss of soil organic carbon and desertification in the Huangfuchuan watershed of the northern LP. A comprehensive land degradation index (LDI) was developed by combining different degradation processes using the fuzzy logic modeling method. Our results showed significant land use transitions from bare land and sandy area to grass land and forest land from 1990 to 2018, which were consistent with an obvious increase in vegetation cover from 31.24% to 40.72%. The soil erosion rate predicted by the RUSLE model decreased by 51.95% during 1990-2018. The basin-average LDI decreased from 0.68 in 1990 to 0.51 in 2018, suggesting the great success of land degradation prevention in a fragile ecological environment region on the LP during the past decades. This study proposed an integrated framework for land degradation assessment in the high erodible area. The results can provide good references for the improvement of ecological environment in the future.

In this study, we measured soil properties in the 0-to-100-cm soil layer of eroded orchards in southern China after 17-yr of application of different conservation measures. The purpose of the experiment was to examine the effect of biological (grass planting, intercropping) and engineering measures (terrace) on the soil quality of eroded orchards. We selected an orchard plot with traditional clean-tillage as control. In comparison, soil pH, organic carbon, total phosphorus, microbial carbon, available potassium, and available micro-elements contents increased significantly in orchards with biological measures, and the improvements were more dramatic in orchards planting grass in strips. However, biological measures significantly reduced the mean weight diameter of aggregates. Engineering measures significantly increased the soil pH of orchards but decreased the contents of available iron and available manganese. The soil quality index (SQI) was 4-55% higher in the biological treatment than in the control. Moreover, higher SQIs were found in the orchards with grass planting than that with intercropping, and this effect was greater in the topsoil than in deeper soils. On the contrary, engineering measures had similar SQI with clean tillage. These results suggest that biological measures are more effective than engineering measures in maintaining soil quality and nutrient content in eroded orchards in southern China.

Phytoremediation is a sustainable and highly accepted technology for remedi-ation of PTE-contaminated soils. Alfalfa has been widely adopted for the phytoremediation of PTE-contaminated soils due to its large biomass productivity, high PTE tolerance, and strong capacity to take up PTEs. However, there are still no literature reviews systematically summarized the potential of alfalfa in the phytoremediation. Therefore, we review the available literatures that present its PTE uptake, phytotoxicity, tolerance mechanisms, and aided techniques improving the phytoremediation efficiency. In this review, alfalfa shows high amounts of PTEs accumulation, especially in their root tissue. Meanwhile, the inner mechanisms of PTE tolerance and accumulation in alfalfa are discussed including: (i) the activation of antioxidant enzyme system, (ii) subcellular localization, (iii) production of glutathione, phytochelatins, and proline, and (iv) regulation of gene expression. Indeed, excessive PTE can overcome the defense system, which causes oxidative damage in alfalfa plants, thereby inhibiting growth and physiological processes and weakening the ability of PTE uptake. Till now, several ap-proaches have been developed to improve the tolerance and/or accumulation of PTE in alfalfa plants as follows: (i) selection of PTE tolerant cultivars, (ii) applying plant growth regulators, (iii) addition of chelating agents, fertilizer, and biochar materials, and (iv) inoculation of soil microbes. Finally, we indicate that the selection of PTE-tolerant cultivars along with inoculation of soil microbes may be an efficient and eco-friendly strategy of the soil PTE phytoremediation.					黄, 旭/JFJ-8744-2023; Huang, Xu/HOH-0307-2023; Beiyuan, Jingzi/Y-5280-2019; Fang, Lin/HTN-5779-2023; fang, lin chuan/K-4923-2013	Beiyuan, Jingzi/0000-0001-5846-6071; fang, lin chuan/0000-0003-1923-7908; Chen, Li/0000-0002-2113-8872													0045-6535	1879-1298				APR	2022	293								133577	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.133577	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.133577		JAN 2022						35016965					WOS:000793069600003

Human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) has been extensively used as an important indicator for evaluating the sustainable development of the ecosystem. However, few studies quantitatively assessed the driving factors of HANPP. Based on Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectmradiometer (MODIS) data, methods of net primary production (NPP) model and regression analysis, the spatial and temporal distribution of HANPP and its driving factors in the Qilian Mountains from 2005 to 2015 were illustrated. The results showed that the HANPP in the Qilian Mountains decreased gradually from both east to west and from south to north, showing a slight upward overall. The regions affected by human activities and climate change accounted for 26.8% and 73.2% respectively. Moreover, there was a significant negative impact between grain yield and HANPP, and a significant positive impact of either the annual sunshine duration, or livestock amount to HANPP.

However, the P acquisition strategies of plants in such situation are still unclear. In this study, analyses on soil zymography and root morphology were combined for the first time to investigate the effects of pristine and P-modified biochars from apple tree branches on the P acquisition strategies of wheat under Cd stress. The results show that the application of pristine biochar exacerbated the soil's rel-ative P deficiency. Wheat was forced to improve foraging for P by forming longer and thinner roots (average diameter 0.284 mm) as well as releasing more phosphatase to promote P mobilization in the soil. Moreover, bioavailable Cd af-fected the P acquisition strategies of wheat through stimulating the release of phosphatase from roots. The P-modified biochar maintained high levels of Olsen-P (>100 mg kg-1) in the soil over time by slow release, avoiding the creation of relative P deficiency in the soil; and increased the average root diameter (0.338 mm) and growth performance index, which promoted shoot growth (length and biomass). Furthermore, the P-modified biochar reduced DTPA-extracted Cd concentration in soils by 79.8 % (pristine biochar by 26.9 %), and decreased the Cd translocation factor from root to shoot as well as Cd concentration in the shoots. Therefore, P-modified biochar has a great potential to reg-ulate the soil element balance (carbon, nitrogen, and P), promote wheat growth, and remediate the Cd-contaminated soil.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				JAN 15	2023	856		1						159033	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159033		SEP 2022						36183665					WOS:000871023300004

To fill this gap, we collected samples from the mouth, teat skin, and rumen of lactating yaks and from the rumen of sucking calves concomitantly on seven occasions between days 7 and 180 after birth under grazing conditions. We observed that the eukaryotic communities clustered based on sample sites, except for the protozoal community in the teat skin, with negative correlations between fungal and protozoal diversities in the rumen of calves. Furthermore, fungi in the dam's mouth, which is the greatest source of the calf's rumen fungi, accounted for only 0.1%, and the contribution of the dam's rumen to the calf's rumen fungi decreased with age and even disappeared after day 60. In contrast, the average contribution of the dam's rumen protozoa to the calf's rumen protozoa was 3.7%, and the contributions from the dam's teat skin (from 0.7 to 2.7%) and mouth (from 0.4 to 3.3%) increased with age. Thus, the divergence in dam-to-calf transmissibility between fungi and protozoa indicates that the foundation of these eukaryotic communities is shaped by different rules. This study provides the first measurements of the maternal contribution to the fungal and protozoal establishment in the rumen of sucking and grazing yak calves in early life, which could be beneficial for future microbiota manipulation in neonatal ruminants.

Exclosure Management in the Highlands of Ethiopia	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												In order to foster the potential of exclosures to sequester carbon, it is understood that they are increasingly assisted through enrichment planting. To study the impact of the enrichment planting on carbon sequestration process, five exclosures with enrichment planting and five pure naturally regenerated exclosures were selected. Along parallel transects, 20 x 20 m plots were laid at 100 m intervals where all woody vegetations were counted and measured for their diameter and total height. For soil sampling, five subplots at the center and four at each corner of the plots were established. The samples were collected at a depth of 0-0.2 m, and this procedure was repeated for each plot. In this case, when good management practices were implemented (such as Wukro exclosures), significant differences in organic soil carbon above the ground and the total carbon between naturally regenerated and enriched exclosures (P < 0.05) were found. The mean estimates of the above ground carbon, soil carbon, and total carbon were respectively 8.08, 31.04, and 39.12 ton/ha for natural regeneration vs. 7.94, 31.00, and 38.93 ton/ha for enriched regeneration. Lower altitudes had significantly higher soil organic carbon (P < 0.05) than the higher altitudes. However, the slope had an insignificant effect on carbon distribution. Enriched exclosures performed more poorly in carbon sequestration. This was possibly due to the disturbances caused by mass plantation and poor post plantation follow up, since improved performance (P < 0.05) was seen in one enriched exclosure with better management practices.

Ruminal bacteria play a major role in feed degradation, and therefore, we hypothesized that ruminal bacteria composition would differ between yaks and cattle, and confer an advantage to yaks for poor quality diets. To test our hypothesis, we determined the ruminal bacteria profiles, rumen fermentation parameters, and enzyme activities in these bovine species consuming a low-protein diet differing in energy level. Six castrated yaks (155 +/- 5.8 kg) and 6 castrated Qaidam cattle (154 +/- 8.0 kg) were used in two concurrent 4 x 4 Latin square designs with 2 additional animals of each species in each period. The animals were offered a low-protein diet of 70.4 g/kg dry matter (DM) and one of four metabolizable energy levels, namely 6.62, 8.02, 9.42, and 10.80 MJ/kg. Ruminal pH, concentrations of ammonia-N and total volatile fatty acids (VFAs), the molar proportion of acetate, and the ratio of acetate to propionate (A:P) were greater (P < 0.05), whereas the molar proportion of propionate was lesser (P = 0.043) in yaks than in cattle. With increasing dietary energy level, ruminal pH, the molar proportion of acetate and the ratio of A:P decreased linearly (P < 0.05), whereas, the concentration of total VFAs, molar proportions of propionate, butyrate, iso-butyrate, and iso-valerate and concentration of ammonia-N increased linearly (P < 0.05). The relative abundance (RA) of Firmicutes increased linearly (P < 0.01), whereas, the RA of Bacteroidetes decreased linearly (P < 0.001) with increasing energy level in both bovine species. The RAs of Prevotella and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group decreased linearly (P < 0.05) with increasing energy level in both yaks and cattle. The RAs of fibrolytic (e.g., Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group), and H-2-incorporating (e.g., Quinella) bacteria were greater (P < 0.05) in yaks than in cattle. We concluded that the two bovines differ in ruminal bacterial profiles and rumen fermentation parameters, and confer an advantage to yaks over cattle in consuming a low protein diet with differing energy level.					wang, wenjuan/JGD-0428-2023; RAN, TAO/JOZ-6216-2023; Sun, Tao/ABI-9387-2022	RAN, TAO/0000-0001-9699-3091; 														1664-302X				SEP 6	2022	13								982338	10.3389/fmicb.2022.982338	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.982338								36147854					WOS:000858598800001

To assess the spatial variability of soil chemical properties in the Fogera plain, Ethiopia, we used Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), pair-wise comparisons, descriptive analysis, and principal component analysis (PCA). In 2019, soil samples were collected at topsoil (a soil depth of 0-20 cm) from three representative land-uses (cropland, plantation forestland, and grazing lands) using a grid-sampling design. The variance analysis for soil pH, available phosphorus (avP), organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), electrical conductivity (EC), exchangeable potassium (exchK), exchangeable calcium (exchCa), and cation exchange capacity (CEC) revealed significant differences among the land-uses. The highest mean values of pH (8.9), avP (32.99 ppm), OC (4.82%), TN (0.39%), EC (2.28 dS m(-1)), and exchK (2.89 cmol (+) kg(-1)) were determined under grazing land. The lowest pH (6.2), OC (2.3%), TN (0.15%), and EC (0.11 dS m(-1)) were recorded in cultivated land. The PCA result revealed that the land-use change was responsible for most soil chemical properties, accounting for 93.32%. Soil maps can help identify the nutrient status, update management options, and increase productivity and profit. The expansion of cultivated lands resulted in a significant decrease in soil organic matter. Thus, soil management strategies should be tailored to replenish the soil nutrient content while maintaining agricultural productivity in the Fogera plain.

Yet the productivity of the major cereals - rice, wheat, and maize - in the region are far lower than their potential. Nutrient management plays a crucial role in improving cereal yields and economic return, and continued improvement in nutrient management practices and their on-farm implementation is required to develop locally relevant solutions that are site-specific, easy-to-develop and geared towards system resilience. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to conduct the comparative assessment of three nutrient management strategies for the three major cereals considering productivity, profitability and nutrient use efficiencies (NUE); estimate their potential yields and yield gaps; and explain the causes of yield variability across farmer-participatory on-farm trials in the EIGP of Nepal. METHODS: We compared three nutrient management strategies (farmer's fertilizer practice- FP, government recommendation -GR, and Nutrient Expert (R)- NE-based recommendation), in 600 on-farm trials. We used the NE DSS tool, APSIM - a cropping system simulation model, and machine learning (ML) approaches (Linear Mixed Effect model-LME; and Random Forest model - RF) for the three cereals using data from those trials. The NE and APSIM were chosen due to simplicity in use and their wider evaluation and application in fertilizer recommendation yield prediction; RF was chosen due to its robustness in predictive ability and identifying and ranking factors determining yield or other variables of interest. RESULTS: The NE-based fertilizer recommendations for maize, wheat and rice increased yield by about 3.5, 1.4, and 1.3 t ha(-1) respectively, increased profits, and improved NUE over FP or GR. The risk analysis showed that at a given probability level, NE always resulted in higher yields of all cereals than GR or FP. APSIM identified 25th June as optimum transplanting date for rice and 10th December as optimum sowing date for maize and wheat and simulated long-term average potential yield of 7-7.5, 5-5.5 and 13-13.3 t ha(-1) respectively for rice, wheat and maize. There were larger yield gaps between PY and FP (2.6-8.5 t ha(-1)) than PY and NE (2.0-3.7 t ha(-1)) across crops and villages. The LME model showed highly significant treatment and location effects for grain yield of all cereals. The point estimate of the difference for grain yield as estimated by Tukey's HSD test was highest for NE-FP and lowest for GR-FP for all crops. The RF model identified grain N uptake for rice and grain P and K uptakes for wheat and maize as most influential factors contributing to their grain yield under each nutrient management strategy. CONCLUSIONS: The NE-based nutrient management had significant effects over FP and GR leading to positive changes on yield and economic performance under varied growing environments. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings based on novel tools and approaches have important policy implications for increasing food security and profits from the major cereals by refining or improving the GR or FP and increasing their NUE in Nepal. Studies with larger sample size across varied agro-climatic zones in the EIGP and much of South Asia would help policy makers consider DSS tools and ML approaches suitable for upscaling and largescale adoption by smallholder farmers.

The refined single crystal X-ray diffraction data reveals cubic Bi12FeO20 structure with single crystal parameters. Occurrence of rare Fe4+ state is identified via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The lattice parameter (a) and corresponding molar volume (V-m) of Bi12FeO20 have been measured in the temperature range of 30-700 degrees C by the X-ray diffraction method. The thermal expansion coefficient (alpha) 3.93x10(-5) K-1 was calculated from the measured values of the parameters. Electronic structure and density of states are investigated by first principle calculations. Photoelectrochemical measurements on single crystals with bandgap of 2 eV reveal significant photo response. The photoactivity of as grown crystals were further investigated by degrading organic effluents such as Methylene blue (MB) and Congo red (CR) under natural sunlight. BFO showed photodegradation efficiency about 74.23% and 32.10% for degrading MB and CR respectively. Interesting morphology and microstructure of pointed spearhead like BFO crystals provide a new insight in designing and synthesizing multifunctional single crystals.

AimsWe aimed to determine the temporal variation in PSF at different stages of grassland community succession and the influencing factors. MethodsWe conducted a 3-year experiment to examine how PSF changes during different successional stages (early-, mid- and late-). Setaria viridis, Stipa bungeana and Bothriochloa ischaemum were selected as representative and dominant early-, mid- and late-species, respectively, in the semiarid grassland of the Loess Plateau, China. ResultsThe temporal variation in the PSF pattern was found to be species-specific. Negative and neutral PSF patterns in early- and mid-species, respectively, were found within the 3-year growth periods. A positive PSF pattern for late-species was found in the second growth period, and a negative PSF pattern was found in the third growth period. The shoot biomass of early-species was overall positively correlated with soil nutrients and enzyme activity in the soil of the three species. However, the shoot biomass of late-species was overall negatively correlated with soil nutrients and enzyme activity in early-species soil. ConclusionsWe suggest that the negative PSF of early-species over the growing period explains why the advantage of these early colonizers is temporary. In contrast, the positive PSF of late-species likely contributes to their successful colonization and the entire community succession process. Our results indicated that PSF plays an important role in the progression of plant community succession.						xue, sha/0000-0002-4452-8726; Xu, Hongwei/0000-0002-3628-3378													1436-8730	1522-2624				APR	2023	186	2					169	176		10.1002/jpln.202200292	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.202200292		DEC 2022											WOS:000903772200001

Therefore, exploring the stress response of winter wheat to different soil water changes during this stage can improve the drought priming strategies. This study examined the physiological response of winter wheat during two seasons of greenhouse pot experiments (2018-2019, 2019-2020) in the following four treatments: adequate water supply (control, C), persistent drought (P), intermittent drought (I), and gradual drought (G). An adequate water supply (75-85 % FC, field capacity) was always maintained for treatment C. Before jointing, plants in treatment P were maintained in a drought state (55-65 % FC), while in treatment I, plants underwent a change in soil water status from 55-65% FC to re -watering up to 75-85 % FC and back to 55-65 % FC. After entering the jointing stage, plants in treatments P and I were re-watered to 75-85 % FC. There was no water supplied in treatment G throughout the experiment. The soil water content (SWC) in treatment G gradually decreased with time (100-34 % FC). At the same time, abscisic acid (ABA), and osmotic substances accumulated exponentially with the reduction of SWC, the activity of antioxidant protective enzymes increased significantly, and the change in the stomatal closure rate was faster than the decrease in photosynthetic rate (Pn). Drought priming before jointing in treatments P and I prompted photosynthetic compensation after re-watering at the jointing stage, with the highest Pn in treatment I, followed by treatment P, and lastly, treatment C. The drought-re-watering cycle stimulated the stress response indicators in primed plants; hence, they were significantly higher than the stable levels in non-primed plants. Specifically, the ABA level in the leaves increased faster than the other indicators under repeated drought. Moreover, the relationship between photosynthesis and ABA was stronger than with antioxidative enzymes and osmolytes. Besides, increasing the number of drought-re-watering cycles enabled the primed plants to achieve a higher maximum Pn after re-watering and enhanced the association between soluble sugar and Pn. Overall, increasing the frequency of drought-re-watering enhanced the drought priming effect on the wheat stress response. Besides, there is a time difference in the response of different drought stress indicators to soil water changes. The findings in this study provide an empirical reference for better utilization of drought priming strategies to stimulate crop production.

Nevertheless, the effect of As on soil phosphatase activity after its desorption by P is not adequately studied. This study employed sequential extraction procedure and ecological dose parameters to show As mobility and its toxicity to acid phosphatase (AcP). Results indicated that P application significantly increased As desorption ratio in the As ageing process. In S1 (As 2895 mg kg(-1)) soil, after P addition, the water-soluble (F-WS) fraction had the highest proportion of As, while for S2 (As 645 mg kg(-1)) and S3 (As 39 mg kg(-1)) it was residual (F-RES) fraction. Additionally, P addition increased the As bioavailability in all soils. Generally, P addition significantly reduced soil AcP activity under all P concentrations and increased in the soil with minimum As content. The variation partitioning analysis indicated that for S1, P concentration was the major factor, for S2 and S3 soils, it was As desorption and ageing time, respectively, that influenced the AcP activity in soils. The calculated ecological dose (ED50) showed that in most cases, As toxicity increased at the end of ageing. Thus, it is essential to control the phosphorus fertilizer applications in silty soils with acid and neutral pH, since it can lead to increased As mobility and toxicity to soil AcP.

Plastic mulching significantly improves soil enzyme and microbial activities without mitigating gaseous N emissions in winter wheat-summer maize rotations	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Plastic mulching is an important agricultural practice to increase crop yield by increasing soil temperature and moisture. Plastic mulching can also affect soil greenhouse gas emissions [e.g., N2O emissions and NH3 volatilization] and soil characteristics such as soil enzyme and microbial activities, but the simultaneous effects of plastic mulching on these parameters and the potential links between them are rarely evaluated. Here, we conducted a field study to investigate the concurrent responses of N2O emissions, NH3 volatilization, soil enzyme and microbial activities, soil dissolved organic C (DOC) and N (DON), and crop yield to plastic mulching (mulching) and no mulching (ambient) under consecutive winter wheat-summer maize rotation cycles in China's Loess Plateau. The mulching treatment significantly increased soil water-filled pore spaces (WFPS) and soil temperature during growing cycle 1 (2018-2019 winter wheat and 2019 summer maize) and cycle 2 (2019-2020 winter wheat and 2020 summer maize). Averaged across both growing cycles, the mulching treatment significantly increased winter wheat yield by 31.8 %, summer maize yield by 36.4 %, soil NO3--N content by 18.2 %, NH4+-N content by 27.4 %, cumulative N2O emissions by 34.0 % and NH3 volatilization by 50.6 %, relative to the ambient treatment. Moreover, the mulching treatment significantly enhanced soil alkaline phosphatase, invertase, catalase, and urease activities and soil microbial biomass C and N contents in the 0-10 cm soil layer across both growing cycles. This study revealed a tradeoff, with plastic mulching significantly improving crop yields and soil enzyme and microbial activities but not mitigating N2O emissions or NH3 volatilization. Our results highlight that simultaneously documenting gaseous N emissions and changes in soil properties under plastic mulching can advance the understanding of sustainable agriculture in semi-arid areas.

NO3--rich groundwater has been recorded in the Guanzhong Plain in the Yellow River Basin of China for over 1000 years. To assess the sources and fate of NO3- in the vadose zone and groundwater, numerous samples were collected via borehole drilling and field surveys, followed by analysis and stable NO3- isotope quantification. The results demonstrated that the NO3- concentration in 38% of the groundwater samples exceeded the limit set by the World Health Organization. The total NO3- stock in the 0???10 m soil profile of the orchards was 3.7 times higher than that of the croplands, suggesting that the cropland-to-orchard transition aggravated NO3- accumulation in the deep vadose zone. Based on a Bayesian mixing model applied to stable NO3- isotopes (delta N-15 and delta O-18), NO3- accumulation in the vadose zone was predominantly from manure and sewage N (MN, 27-54%), soil N (SN, 0-64%), and chemical N fertilizer (FN, 4-46%). MN was, by far, the greatest contributor to groundwater NO3- (58-82%). The results also indicated that groundwater NO3- was mainly associated with the soil and hydrogeochemical characteristics, whereas no relationship with modern agricultural activities was observed, likely due to the time delay in the thick vadose zone. The estimated residence time of NO3- in the vadose zone varied from decades to centuries; however, NO3- might reach the aquifer in the near future in areas with recent FN loading, especially those under cropland-to-orchard transition or where the vadose zone is relatively thin. This study suggests that future agricultural land-use transitions from croplands to orchards should be promoted with caution in areas with shallow vadose zones and coarse soil texture.

Radiative transfer (RT) models for simulating scattering and (re-) absorption of SIF provide a powerful tool to study the upscaling of SIF signal from leaf level to terrestrial ecosystems. Based on the Monte Carlo ray-tracing (MCRT) model, WPS (Weighted Photon Spread), we made major extensions with new functionalities and systematic evaluation of the new modules. By modeling the radiative coupling between atmosphere and land surface with the same MCRT method, the non-fluorescent and SIF radiance received by sensors can be simulated at levels from top-of canopy to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) in a coherent manner. New extension to represent the three-dimensional (3-D) canopies with geometrical primitives composed of turbid medium makes the hyperspectral simulation (especially SIF) for a sensor with medium spatial resolution at kilometer-scale feasible and practical. Evaluations through ROMC (Radiation transfer model intercomparison Online Model Checker) show that the accuracy of the new module of 3-D structure representation in WPS is within 1% of the reference solution. The spectra of TOA radiance and SIF and their components simulated at nadir by WPS agree closely with those simulated by the coupled SCOPE and MODTRAN models with the coefficient of determination (R-2) higher than 0.99 and the average absolute relative error (AARE) lower than 6.39%; for angular distributions of TOA radiance and SIF at 685 nm and 740 nm, R-2 is higher than 0.81 and AARE is lower than 6.94%. Comparisons of the spectra of TOA radiance and SIF and their components simulated at nadir by WPS and the DART model give R-2 higher than 0.99 and AARE lower than 3.5%; R-2 is higher than 0.92 and AARE is lower than 5.92% for the TOA angular simulations. The WPS model was also evaluated by hyperspectral measurements through unmanned aerial vehicle at different altitudes, which shows that WPS can reproduce the spectral features of a rapeseed crop. WPS can be used as a versatile tool to assess the impacts of various factors on the SIF signal and to evaluate the SIF retrieval methods under different conditions.

However, to date, little is known about how vegetation and erosion individually or jointly affect soil N mineralization under field conditions across a range of sites varying in soil and climate properties on a long-term observational scale. In this study, we elucidated how soil net N mineralization responds to vegetation removal (plots with vs. without vegetation) and landscape position (eroding vs. depositional zones) during a two-year manipulation experiment using an in situ incubation method on the China's Loess Plateau. The results indicated that the nitrate and total mineral N concentrations and net nitrification and mineralization rates were higher in the eroding zone (2.74 +/- 0.12 mg kg-1, 4.47 +/- 0.13 mg kg- 1, 0.046 +/- 0.005 mg kg- 1 d-1 and 0.046 +/- 0.006 mg kg- 1 d-1) than those in the depositional zone (2.01 +/- 0.10 mg kg- 1, 3.80 +/- 0.12 mg kg- 1, 0.030 +/- 0.005 mg kg- 1 d-1 and 0.032 +/- 0.006 mg kg- 1 d-1) on the China's Loess Plateau. Vegetation removal resulted in an increase in the nitrate (2.88 +/- 0.13 vs. 1.87 +/- 0.09 mg kg- 1) and total mineral N concentrations (4.56 +/- 0.14 vs. 3.71 +/- 0.11 mg kg- 1), but did not affect the soil net N mineralization rates on the China's Loess Plateau. The effects of vegetation removal on soil mineral N pools depended on the site, season and landscape position, with stronger effects in the eroding zone than those in the depositional zone. However, the responses of the net N mineralization rates to vegetation removal were consistent across the various landscape positions and sites, but varied with the season. Variance partitioning revealed that soil properties rather than climate and vegetation conditions were the most dominant contributors to the variations of soil N mineralization in both the eroding and depositional zones, explaining 37.6-64.6% of the variation. These results emphasized the substantial spatial (landscape position and site) and temporal (seasonal) dependence of the effects of vegetation removal on soil N mineralization at large scale.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				AUG	2022	215								106336	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106336	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106336		MAY 2022											WOS:000804506700002

In strawberry cultivation, continuous cropping (CC) can seriously threaten yield and quality. However, our understanding of the gene expression changes in response to CC and during subsequent defense processes is limited. In this study, we analyzed the impact of CC on the transcriptome of strawberry roots using RNA-Seq technology to elucidate the effect of CC and the subsequent molecular changes. Results We found that CC significantly affects the growth of strawberry plants. The transcriptome analysis identified 136 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 49 up-regulated and 87 down-regulated DEGs. A Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicated that the up-regulated DEGs were mainly assigned to defense-related GO terms, and most down-regulated DEGs were assigned to nutrient-related GO terms. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that the responsive DEGs were classified in a large number of important biological pathways, such as phenylalanine metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism and plant-pathogen interaction. We also found that four WRKY transcription factors and three peroxidase genes involved in plant defense pathways were up-regulated in the roots of strawberry plants subjected to CC. Conclusion Several unigenes involved in plant defense processes, such as CNGCs, WRKY transcription factors, PR1, and peroxidase genes with highly variable expression levels between non-CC and CC treatments may be involved in the regulation of CC in strawberry. These results indicate that strawberry roots reallocate development resources to defense mechanisms in response to CC. This study will further deepen our understanding of the fundamental regulatory mechanisms of strawberry resource reallocation in response to CC.

In the present study, we assessed occurrence, composition, and risk assessment of PAHs in Wei River Basin. It was found that the total concentration ( n-ary sumation (16)PAHs) of selected PAHs in sediments for the main stream of Wei River and its tributaries ranged from n.d. (not detectable) to 577.25 ng g(-1) and 36.35 to 2348.77 ng g(-1), respectively. The PAHs were mostly dominated by PHE and FLT. Based on the diagnostic ratios of FLT/(FLT + PYR), BaA/(BaA + CHR), and PCA analysis, we deducted that diesel emissions and incomplete combustion of petroleum fuels were predominant in the selected area. For sediment quality guidelines (SQGs), adverse effects of three PAHs (ACE, PHE, and BgP) in sediment were occasionally observed, while the other 9 PAHs were considered to occur rarely. The total carcinogenicity of PAHs assessed by TEQ(BaP) ranged from n.d. to 138.84 ng g(-1), and BaP played the dominant role. The ecological risk of individual PAHs (ACE, FLU, PHE, FLT, PYR, BaA, BbF, BaP) were moderate, while other compounds were negligible. Total ecological risk of n-ary sumation (16)PAHs posed low to moderate ecological risk in Wei River Basin.

Qaidam cattle (Bos taurus), introduced to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau 1,700 years ago, are raised at a lower altitude than yaks, provided with shelter at night and offered supplements in winter. Based on their different backgrounds, we hypothesized that yaks have lower energy requirements for maintenance than cattle. To test this hypothesis, we measured average daily gain (ADG), apparent digestibilities, energy balance, rumen fermentation parameters, and serum metabolites in growing yaks and cattle offered diets differing in metabolizable energy (ME) levels (6.62, 8.02, 9.42 and 10.80 MJ/kg), but with the same crude protein concentration. Six castrated yaks (155 +/- 5.8 kg) and 6 castrated Qaidam cattle (154 +/- 8.0 kg), all 2.5 years old, were used in 2 concurrent 4 x 4 Latin square designs. Neutral and acid detergent fiber digestibilities were greater (P < 0.05) in yaks than in cattle, and decreased linearly (P < 0.05) with increasing dietary energy level; whereas, digestibilities of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein and ether extract increased (P < 0.05) linearly with increasing energy level. The ADG was greater (P < 0.001) in yaks than in cattle, and increased (P < 0.05) linearly with increasing energy levels. From the regressions of ADG on ME intake, the estimated ME requirement for maintenance was lower (P < 0.05) in yaks than in cattle (0.43 vs. 0.57 MJ/kg BW0.75). The ratios of digestible energy (DE):gross energy and ME:DE were higher (P < 0.05) in yaks than in cattle, and increased (P < 0.05) linearly with increasing dietary energy level. Ruminal pH decreased (P < 0.05), whereas concentrations of total volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and ammonia increased (P < 0.01) with increasing dietary energy level, and all were greater (P < 0.05) in yaks than in cattle. Concentrations of ruminal acetate and iso-VFAs were greater (P < 0.05), whereas propionate was lower (P < 0.05) in yaks than in cattle; acetate decreased (P < 0.001), whereas butyrate and propionate increased (P < 0.001) linearly with increasing dietary energy level.

Presently, it is not known how an afforestation-induced decrease in moisture affects soil microbial community and functionality, hindering our ability to understand the sustainability of the rehabilitated ecosystems. To address this issue, we examined the impacts of 20 years of afforestation on soil bacterial community, co-occurrence pattern, and functionalities along vertical profile (0-500 cm depth) in a semiarid region of China's Loess Plateau. We showed that the effects of afforestation with a deep-rooted legume tree on cropland were greater in deep than that of in top layers, resulting in decreased bacterial beta diversity, more responsive bacterial taxa and functional groups, increased homogeneous selection, and decreased network robustness in deep soils (120-500 cm). Organic carbon and nitrogen decomposition rates and multifunctionality also significantly decreased by afforestation, and microbial carbon limitation significantly increased in deep soils. Moreover, changes in microbial community and functionality in deep layer was largely related to changes in soil moisture. Such negative impacts on deep soils should be fully considered for assessing afforestation's eco-environment effects and for the sustainability of ecosystems because deep soils have important influence on forest ecosystems in semiarid and arid climates.

Insights from nine long-term fertilization experiments	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Manure application is widely recognized as a method of improving soil structure and soil fertility due to additional organic matter and nutrient inputs. However, the salinity of animal manure may have a detrimental effect on soil aggregation. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of long-term animal manure application on soil aggregation, binding agents (soil organic carbon, SOC and glomalin-related soil protein, GRSP), and dispersing agents (e.g., Na+) and their relationships based on nine long-term fertilization experiments (12 to 39 yr) across China. The two red soil experiments (Qiyang, QY and Jinxian, JX) and one paddy soil experiment in Jinxian (JX-P) were conducted in southern China (precipitation above 1200 mm yr(-1)), whereas the other six experiments were established in semi-humid or arid regions in China with precipitation in the range of 500-900 mm yr(-1). Each experiment included three treatments as follows: no fertilization (Control), inorganic fertilizer (NP or NPK), and a combination of inorganic fertilizer and animal manure (NPM or NPKM). Longterm animal manure application not only significantly increased the biological binding agents (i.e., SOC and GRSP) in the nine experiments but also considerably increased the dispersing agents (i.e., exchangeable Na+) (P < 0.05), except for the paddy soil experiment. Consequently, soil aggregate stability increased after animal manure application in three experimental sites in southern China but not in the experimental sites in northern China. Aggregate stability had a positive relationship with SOC and GRSP in the experimental sites in southern China (P < 0.01) but a negative relationship with exchangeable Na+ in the experimental sites in northern China (P < 0.05). The Na+ accumulation in soils was negatively related to mean annual precipitation (P < 0.001). Our study demonstrates that the long-term application of animal manure may degrade soil structure via the Na+ accumulation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We compared sucrose digestion capacity and sucrase enzymatic activity per unit intestinal surface area among 50 avian species from the New World, Africa, and Australia, including 20 nectarivores. With some exceptions, nectarivores had smaller intestinal surfaces, higher sucrose hydrolysis capacity, and greater sucrase activity per unit intestinal area. Convergence analysis showed high values for sucrose hydrolysis and sucrase activity per unit intestinal surface area in specialist nectarivores, matching the high proportion of sucrose in the nectar of the plants they pollinate. Plants pollinated by generalist nectar-feeding birds in the Old and New Worlds secrete nectar in which glucose and fructose are the dominant sugars. Matching intestinal enzyme activity in birds and nectar composition in flowers appears to be an example of convergent coevolution between plants and pollinators on an intercontinental scale.

However, few studies reported the effects of the divergent successions on ecohydrological process of alpine meadow. Here, we report an in situ experiment to examine the effects of the divergent successions on soil pore structure, infiltration rate and evapotranspiration of the two types of divergent-succession meadows (the shrub-encroached meadow and the severely degraded meadow), compared to the normal alpine meadow. Results showed that both the shrub-encroached meadow and the severely degraded meadow significantly reduced the dominant Kobresia spp. (Cyperaceae family) coverage, soil compactness, and belowground biomass, but significantly increased soil non-capillary porosity (P < 0.05) compared to the normal alpine meadow. Soil infiltration rate was significantly negatively correlated with Kobresia spp. coverage, soil compactness and belowground biomass, while significantly positively correlated with soil non-capillary porosity (P < 0.05). Therefore, the shrub-encroached meadow and the severely degraded meadow increased soil infiltration rates not only by reducing the dominated Kobresia spp. (Cyperaceae family) coverage and belowground biomass, but also by increasing soil non-capillary porosity. Compared with the normal alpine meadow, the cumulative infiltration and evapotranspiration increased by 245.25% and 45.19% in the shrub-encroached meadows, and increased by 208.23% and 29.95% in the severely degraded meadow. However, short-term grazing exclusion presented little effect on soil infiltration rate in alpine meadows. Overall, the divergent successions of alpine meadows had a greater impact on soil water replenishment and evapotranspiration than the short-term grazing exclusion. These findings can help to better understand the impacts of the divergent community succession on the ecohydrological process in alpine grassland ecosystem.

In this study, a Budyko framework was used to analyze the impact of ecological construction measures on the long-term water-energy balance and quantify the contribution of climate variables and ecological construction measures to runoff change. First, the explanatory variables of land surface parameters were selected and evaluated; next, the long-term rainfall-runoff models were established based on the Budyko hypothesis with land surface parameters expressed as a function of explanatory variables. Finally, the runoff elasticities of each explanatory variable were derived, and the contribution of climate variables and ecological construction measures to runoff change at different sub-periods were further analyzed. The framework was applied to the Wuding River, which is a large tributary of the Yellow River located in the Loess Plateau, and a bootstrapping technique was applied to conduct cross validation of the proposed framework. Among the five ecological construction measures, i.e. horizontal terrace, check-dam, artificial grassland, artificial afforestation, and natural reforestation, the most significant impact on the long-term water-energy balance was the natural reforestation; the role of artificial grassland on runoff was also significant. Analysis of contribution rates to runoff change revealed that precipitation is the main factor associated with the decrease in runoff from the 1970s to the 1990s compared to the baseline period from 1957 to 1971, and the impact of vegetation measures increased and gradually became dominant after the year 2000.

Here, we investigated the potential antioxidant role of H2S in soybean (Glycine max)-rhizobia (Sinorhizobium fredii) symbiotic root nodules. Method An endogenous H2S production deficit rhizobia mutant increment CSE was constructed to study the effect of decreased content of H2S in soybean nodules. Fluorescent probes and confocal microscope were used to observe the production and accumulation of H2S and reactive oxygen species. Transmission electronic microscopy was conducted to study the structural changes in increment CSE soybean nodules. Finally, qRT-PCR, enzymatic activity, and oxidative damage parameters were measured. Result The results demonstrated that abundant H2S was generated in the nitrogen-fixing zone of soybean nodules. The deletion of the cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) gene in S. fredii ( increment CSE) caused a sharp decrease in H2S production in both free-living rhizobia and soybean nodules. We found that decrease in the H2S level in nodule cells inhibited nitrogenase activity. In addition, to elevated H2O2 and malondialdehyde accumulation, increased protein carbonyl content and decreased O-2(-) scavenging ability was observed in increment CSE root nodules. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that an H2S deficit caused the deformation of bacteroids and damage of peribacteroid membranes in nodule cells. Moreover, the expression of some rhizobial and soybean genes related to antioxidant defense was up-regulated in increment CSE nodules. Conclusion H2S is crucial for the nitrogen-fixation ability of soybean nodules by acting as an antioxidant element that protects nodule cells and bacteroids from oxidative damage.

We quantified the effects of N deposition on biomass increment, soil organic carbon (SOC), and N2O and CH4 fluxes and, ultimately, the net GHG budget at ecosystem level of a Moso bamboo forest in China. Nitrogen addition significantly increased woody biomass increment and SOC decomposition, increased N2O emission, and reduced soil CH4 uptake. Despite higher N2O and CH4 fluxes, the ecosystem remained a net GHG sink of 26.8 to 29.4 of CO2 equivalent hectare(-1) year(-1) after 4 years of N addition against 22.7 hectare(-1) year(-1) without N addition. The total net carbon benefits induced by atmospheric N deposition at current rates of 30 kilograms of N hectare(-1) year(-1) over Moso bamboo forests across China were estimated to be of 23.8 teragrams of CO2 equivalent year(-1).					deng, lei/M-1340-2014; Ciais, Philippe/A-6840-2011	Ciais, Philippe/0000-0001-8560-4943; Song, Xinzhang/0000-0003-2434-7466													2375-2548					MAR	2020	6	12							eaaw5790	10.1126/sciadv.aaw5790	http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaw5790								32206705					WOS:000521937000001

However, the effects of grassland type on changes in SOC stocks with grassland degradation over broad geographic scales remain unclear. Here, we explored the probably different responses of SOC stocks to grassland degradation for alpine meadows and alpine steppes based on 58 peer-reviewed publications regarding the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The results showed that SOC stock consistently decreased with increasing degradation levels in both alpine meadows and steppes, whereas the magnitudes of reduction of SOC stock in alpine meadows were significantly larger than those in alpine steppes (p < 0.05). The variations in SOC stock were significantly positively correlated with variations in aboveground biomass in the alpine steppes only (p < 0.05) but were significantly positively correlated with variations in belowground biomass in both alpine meadows and alpine steppes (p < 0.01). The relationships between change rates of SOC stock with initial SOC stock and mean annual precipitation were both significantly negative during the lightly and moderately degraded stages, while the negative relationship became nonsignificant for the heavily degraded stage (p > 0.05). These findings suggest that soil organic carbon stock responded more sensitively to degradation in alpine meadows with higher initial SOC stock and annual mean precipitation than in alpine steppes. Our study might have significant implications for future sustainable management practices for carbon sequestration of alpine grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

Although variation in such effects is expected to be related to fire severity, another potentially important and poorly understood factor is the effect of fire seasonality on soil microorganisms. We carried out a large-scale field experiment examining the effects of spring (early-dry season) versus autumn (late-dry- season) burns on the community composition of soil fungi in a typical Mediterranean woodland. Although the intensity and severity of our prescribed burns were largely consistent between the two burning seasons, we detected differential fire season effects on the composition of the soil fungal community, driven by changes in the saprotrophic fungal guild. The community composition of ectomycorrhizal fungi, assayed both in pine seedling bioassays and from soil sequencing, appeared to be resilient to the variation inflicted by seasonal fires. Since changes in the soil saprotrophic fungal community can directly influence carbon emission and decomposition rates, we suggest that regardless of their intensity and severity, seasonal fires may cause changes in ecosystem functioning.

Understanding the mechanism of its interaction with the habitat process is conducive to formulating targeted ecological recovery plans. In this study, fish and macroinvertebrates were collected from 49 investigation sites in the Weihe River basin, China, during periods of the summer and the autumn of 2017. Cluster analysis and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) were used to analyze the similarity of community distribution of fish and macroinvertebrates and their response to environmental variables. The biological integrity index of fish (F-IBI) and benthic-macroinvertebrate (B-IBI) was introduced to evaluate the aquatic ecological health. The results showed that fish communities were more coherent than macroinvertebrate communities. The distinguished response to ecological factors was identified for fish and macroinvertebrates. The ecological factors of total nitrogen, conductivity and river width have significant effects on both fish and macroinvertebrate communities. In addition, the fish community was significantly influenced by chlorine, fluorine, pH and flow velocity, while the macroinvertebrate community was significantly influenced by bicarbonate and water depth. The differences in community structure and response to ecological factors between communities were amplified in their environmental quality scores. Although F-IBI and B-IBI tend to be consistent temporally, the correlation is not significant. B-IBI showed decreasing gradient of ecological health status in the downstream area, while F-IBI tended to be different across river systems, which further illustrated the differences in the response of fish and macroinvertebrates to environmental variables.

However, there are crucial scientific/knowledge gaps regarding the change in the response of soil erodibility of gully heads to revegetation along a vegetation zone gradient. Therefore, we selected the gully heads with different restoration years along a vegetation zone gradient encompassing the steppe zone (SZ), forest-steppe zone (FSZ), and forest zone (FZ) on the Chinese Loess Plateau to clarify the variation in soil erodibility of gully head and its response to soil and vegetation properties from SZ to FZ. Furtherly, we systematically and comprehensively reveal driving factors of changes in soil erodibility in three vegetation zones. Results showed that: (1) Vegetation and soil properties were affected positively by revegetation and differed significantly in three vegetation zones. (2) Soil erodibility of gully heads in SZ was significantly higher than in FSZ and FZ, by 3.3 % and 6.7 % on average, respectively, and it showed a significantly different decrease with restoration years in three vegetation zones. (3) Standardized major axis analysis proved that the sensitivity of response soil erodibility to vegetation characteristics and soil characteristics presented a significant difference as the revegetation proceeded. Vegetation roots were the primary driver in SZ, but soil organic matter content dominated the change in soil erodibility in FSZ and FZ. (4) Structural equation modeling indicated that climate conditions played an indirect role in regulating soil erodibility of gully heads by mediating vegetation characteristics. This study offers essential insights for assessing the ecological functions of revegetation in the gully heads of the Chinese Loess Plateau under different climatic scenarios.					chen, zhuoxin/ABH-4099-2020	chen, zhuoxin/0000-0002-8673-0498													0048-9697	1879-1026				SEP 20	2023	892								164833	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164833	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164833		JUN 2023						37315617					WOS:001035695900001

However, the effects of these factors and their interactions on hillslope soil erosion processes, particularly on long slopes in the Chinese Mollisol region, are still lacking to date. Thus, a set of laboratory experiments, including six upslope inflow rates (0, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 300 L min-1), two tillage depths (5 and 20 cm) and two slope gradients (5 degrees and 10 degrees), were conducted to quantify the impacts of these factors and their interactions on hillslope soil erosion processes. The results showed that soil erosion rates increased as a power function with increase of inflow rate and slope gradient, while they decreased as a power function with an increase in tillage depth. The slope gradient had a greater impact on soil erosion rates than inflow rate and tillage depth. Moreover, inflow rate, slope gradient, and their pairwise interaction mainly governed hillslope soil erosion. Compared with hillslope soil erosion, hillslope runoff rate was dominantly affected by inflow rate. The inflow rate and slope gradient affected the hydrodynamic characteristics and erosion rates by shifting erosion patterns; while tillage depth mainly influenced them by converting surface flow to seepage flow. In addition, the dimensionless effective stream power was the optimal index (R2 = 0.884, NSE = 0.861) affecting soil erosion rates, followed by the dimensionless stream power (R2 = 0.879, NSE = 0.848). The dimensionless soil erosion rates were correlated with the dimensionless hydrodynamic parameter following a power function. Therefore, soil erosion in the Chinese Mollisol region could be effectively prevented by dispersing runoff, increasing deep tillage and reducing the impact of slope gradient through soil conservation measures.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				JUL	2023	228								107189	10.1016/j.catena.2023.107189	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.107189		MAY 2023											WOS:001054572000001

THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS												Key message A stable QTL QPm.caas-3BS for adult-plant resistance to powdery mildew was mapped in an interval of 431 kb, and candidate genes were predicted based on gene sequences and expression profiles. Powdery mildew is a devastating foliar disease occurring in most wheat-growing areas. Characterization and fine mapping of genes for powdery mildew resistance can benefit marker-assisted breeding. We previously identified a stable quantitative trait locus (QTL) QPm.caas-3BS for adult-plant resistance to powdery mildew in a recombinant inbred line population of Zhou8425B/Chinese Spring by phenotyping across four environments. Using 11 heterozygous recombinants and high-density molecular markers, QPm.caas-3BS was delimited in a physical interval of approximately 3.91 Mb. Based on re-sequenced data and expression profiles, three genes TraesCS3B02G014800, TraesCS3B02G016800 and TraesCS3B02G019900 were associated with the powdery mildew resistance locus. Three gene-specific kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) markers were developed from these genes and validated in the Zhou8425B derivatives and Zhou8425B/Chinese Spring population in which the resistance gene was mapped to a 0.3 cM interval flanked by KASP14800 and snp_50465, corresponding to a 431 kb region at the distal end of chromosome 3BS. Within the interval, TraesCS3B02G014800 was the most likely candidate gene for QPm.caas-3BS, but TraesCS3B02G016300 and TraesCS3B02G016400 were less likely candidates based on gene annotations and sequence variation between the parents. These results not only offer high-throughput KASP markers for improvement of powdery mildew resistance but also pave the way to map-based cloning of the resistance gene.					liang, shuang/JOK-5869-2023; Xia, Xianchun/L-2402-2015; Hao, Yuanfeng/ABE-5163-2020	He, Zhonghu/0000-0003-1384-3712													0040-5752	1432-2242				MAR	2022	135	3					1083	1099		10.1007/s00122-021-04019-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-021-04019-2		JAN 2022						35006334					WOS:000741617400001

To meet this demand, crop yields need to increase but climate change presents a potential threat. Genetic and agronomic strategies are helping agriculture adapt to climate change, but introducing new genetic traits into crops is time-consuming and costly. Process-based biophysical modelling is a powerful tool for targeting and accelerating development of new synthetic cultivars, and we have used it to identify the traits of rainfed wheat ideotypes and suitable sowing dates needed to adapt to future climate change in south-eastern Australia. Our simulations involved two Global Climate Models (GCMs) with the driest conditions under a high emission scenario of Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 We compared simulated yields under future climate with those under historical climate with and without changes in cultivar and sowing date. Our results show that wheat yield for the reference cultivar would decrease on average by 23% and 38% in 2061-2100 under RCP8.5 at two contrasting sites (wet and dry, respectively). Ideotypes with an early flowering date, longer grain filling period, larger radiation use efficiency, larger maximum grain size and faster potential grain filling rate, sown on the optimum sowing date proved to be effective at the wet site in reversing these declines, leading to an average yield increase of 20-24% for both GCMs. However, improving cultivars and altering sowing times would have little impact for a drier GCM at the dry site. Although there is some uncertainty in simulations related to the genetic coefficients used in the crop model, climate projections and emission scenarios, we demonstrate that it is possible to enhance wheat production under a future climate if a cultivar with a longer grain filling period and larger yield component parameter was adopted in eastern Australian wheat-growing areas.					, De Li Liu/Y-4656-2019; Yu, Qiang/D-3702-2009; Chen, Chao/A-8242-2015; Wang, Bin/AFI-6568-2022	Yu, Qiang/0000-0001-6950-1821; Wang, Bin/0000-0002-6422-5802; Liu, De Li/0000-0003-2574-1908; Waters, Cathleen/0000-0003-1020-5248													0308-521X	1873-2267				MAR	2019	170						9	18		10.1016/j.agsy.2018.12.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2018.12.005													WOS:000456903400002

This study evaluated the impacts of climate change on the hydrological regime by predicting the change in both monthly and seasonal streamflow, and identified water supply and demand relations under supply management options and environmental flow maintenance. To reach a better understanding of the consequences of possible climate change scenarios and adaptive management options on water supply, an integrated modeling approach was conducted by using the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) and water evaluation and planning model (WEAP). Future scenarios were developed for the future period: 2060s (2051-2070), using an ensemble of three general circulation model (GCM) simulations: GFDL-CM3, GISS-E2-R-CC, and IPSL-CM5A-MR, driven by the climate projection for representative concentration pathways (RCPs): 6.0 (medium emission scenario). The results indicated that, firstly, the future streamflow will decrease, resulting in a decline of future water availability. Secondly, water supply under natural flow conditions would support 46,167 ha of irrigation schemes and the water shortages will be more noticeable when environmental flow maintenance was considered. The study concludes that reservoir construction would be necessary for agriculture mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Furthermore, the water resources management options considering both supply and demand management are more effective and useful than supply management only, particularly in dealing with climate change impacts.

Quantifying the relative contributions of vegetation and climate change on the ET and TF dynamic is of great significance to better understand the water budget between the land and atmosphere. Here, we chose Yellow River Basin (YRB) as the study area and analyzed the spatiotemporal changes of ET, T, and TF from 1982 to 2015 using the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) model. Meanwhile, the relative contributions of vegetation and climate change to ET, T and TF change were quantified. Model evaluation showed that the PT-JPL model performs well in the simulation of ET and T. During 1982-2015, the average annual ET, T, and TF increased at a rate of 3.20 mm/a, 0.77 mm/a and 0.003/a over the YRB during 1982-2015, respectively. The regions with significant increases in ET, T and TF almost covered the whole study area except for the upper reaches of the YRB. Vegetation greening was the main factor for the increase of ET and TF in the YRB and enhanced ET and TF at a rate of 0.72 mm/a and 0.57/a, respectively, which mainly observed in the entire Loess Plateau region (over 50 % of the study area). Precipitation (PRE) was also the dominated factor contributing to the increase in ET and TF, and temperature (TEM) showed a positive correlation with the changes in ET and TF in the most areas of YRB, which jointly dominated ET changes in the upper reaches of the YRB and TF changes in the southern part of the basin. Except for the total effects, leaf area index (LAI) also indirectly promoted ET changes by affecting PRE, TEM and relative humidity (RH). While wind speed (WS) and radiation (RAD) had a relatively weak regulatory effect on the changes in ET and TF. These findings were helpful for regional water resources management and formulating water resources-sustainable vegetation restoration strategies for local government.					chen, yan/JRY-4645-2023; Wang, zijun/JNS-5435-2023; zhou, wei/JQJ-0490-2023; Jing, Jing/JSK-6237-2023; zhao, hang/JVM-8270-2024; Liu, Yangyang/IST-5125-2023	Liu, Yangyang/0000-0001-5118-4901													0048-9697	1879-1026				DEC 15	2023	904								166926	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166926	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166926								37689185					WOS:001080413500001

Environmental thresholds are known to govern global vegetation patterns, but it is still unknown whether they can be used to predict the distribution of soil organisms and functions across global biomes. Using a global field survey of 383 sites across contrasting climatic and vegetation conditions, here we showed that soil biodiversity and functions exhibited pervasive nonlinear patterns worldwide and are mainly governed by water availability (precipitation and potential evapotranspiration). Changes in water availability resulted in drastic shifts in soil biodiversity (bacteria, fungi, protists and invertebrates) and soil functions including plant-microbe interactions, plant productivity, soil biogeochemical cycles and soil carbon sequestration. Our findings highlight that crossing specific water availability thresholds can have critical consequences for the provision of essential ecosystem services needed to sustain our planet. A global field survey of 383 sites with different vegetation types spanning an environmental gradient reveals that soil biodiversity and functions exhibit pervasive nonlinear behaviours worldwide and are mainly governed by water availability.

Here, we estimated biomass productivity and carrying capacity dynamics in the Borana rangeland of southern Ethiopia by using field-based data and remote sensing data (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)). Data was collected from both rainy and dry seasons when biomass production was high and low respectively. Results of linear regression showed that both biomass production (R2adj 1/4 0.672) and NDVI value (R2adj 1/4 0.471) were significantly decreased from 1990 to 2019. Field data and NDVI values for mean annual biomass showed a significant linear rela-tionship. The model accuracy in the annual relationship between the observed and predicted biomass values was strong (R2adj 1/4 0.986) but with high standard error, indicating that the observed biomass production in the rangeland area was not in good condition as compared with the predicted one. This study suggests that, using NDVI data and field-based data in combined way has high potential to esti -mate rangeland biomass and carrying capacity dynamics at extensively grazed arid and semi-arid ran-gelands. And to use for estimating stoking rates and predicting future management techniques for decision making.Copyright (c) 2022 Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Genome-wide transcriptome and physiological analyses provide new insights into peanut drought response mechanisms	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Drought is one of the main constraints in peanut production in West Texas and eastern New Mexico regions due to the depletion of groundwater. A multi-seasonal phenotypic analysis of 10 peanut genotypes revealed C76-16 (C-76) and Valencia-C (Val-C) as the best and poor performers under deficit irrigation (DI) in West Texas, respectively. In order to decipher transcriptome changes under DI, RNA-seq was performed in C-76 and Val-C. Approximately 369 million raw reads were generated from 12 different libraries of two genotypes subjected to fully irrigated (FI) and DI conditions, of which similar to 329 million (90.2%) filtered reads were mapped to the diploid ancestors of peanut. The transcriptome analysis detected 4,508 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 1554 genes encoding transcription factors (TFs) and a total of 514 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among the identified DEGs. The comparative analysis between the two genotypes revealed higher and integral tolerance in C-76 through activation of key genes involved in ABA and sucrose metabolic pathways. Interestingly, one SNP from the gene coding F-box protein (Araip.3WN1Q) and another SNP from gene coding for the lipid transfer protein (Aradu.03ENG) showed polymorphism in selected contrasting genotypes. These SNPs after further validation may be useful for performing early generation selection for selecting drought-responsive genotypes.

This challenge is especially true for a crop like groundnut that is often grown as a rainfed crop in diverse environments and management, leading to considerable production fluctuations among regions and seasons. Developing a means to characterize the drivers of variable yield and to identify region specific breeding objectives were the main motivations for this research, using groundnut production in India, as a case study for rainfed crops. Historically, five groundnut production areas have been considered by Indian crop improvement programs. Our objectives were to assess the relevance of this zonation system and possibly to re-define production areas with a higher degree of similarities into homogeneous production units (HPUs). Towards this, we used yield gap analysis and the geo-biophysical characters of the production region to understand and deal with GxExM interactions. Weather and soil data, crop parameters, and management information data were collected and groundnut production was simulated at the district scale over 30 consecutive years. Consequently, the geographic distribution of the potential yields and the yield gaps were first estimated to understand the main production limitations in a given region. Large and variable yield gaps (with a mean of -70 %) were observed and results revealed a readily exploitable production gap (- 8 M tons), which might be bridged by following recommended agronomic practices. Water deficit limited the yield potential by an average of 40 %, although with large variability among districts. However, large and variable yield gaps remained. To resolve the unexplained variation, principal component and cluster analysis of agronomic model output together with geo-biophysical indicators for each district were carried out. This resulted in seven HPUs, having well-defined production-limiting constraints. Grouping by HPU greatly reduced variance in actual and simulated yields, as compared to grouping across all groundnut production zones in India. The HPU based approach delimited precise geographic regions within which HPU-specific GxM products could be designed by crop improvement programs to boost productivity.

More importantly, most parts of the YRB are located in semi-arid areas of Northwest China, where the ecology and environments are fragile. So, ecological restoration and agricultural production always are the key research topics of the YRB. However, the specific research interest of YRB changed over time and was always closely related to the implementation of government policies. Hence, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of YRB's research topics based on the methods of bibliometrics. The results showed that the number of papers about YRB's research experienced a change from slowly increasing (1998-2010, 83 papers) to rapidly increasing (2011-2015, 128 papers), and then to exponentially rising (2016-2020, 369 papers). Secondly, the main research fields of the YRB included farming, crops, water, soil, environment, and etc. The journal of Agriculture Water Management had the highest global total citations and H-index, even local cited references were the highest among all of the reference papers about the YRB. Through summarizing the most cited papers and references, we found the most important research hotspots about the YRB were: the impacts of climate change and human activities on the amount of sediment in the YRB, the management of soil erosion and vegetation restoration in the YRB, and the relationship between crops and environment and management in the Loess Plateau of China. In addition, "Loess Plateau" was the most frequent keyword in the past ten years and the popularity of "climate change" rose sharply in the past five years. For YRB's research in near future, how to effectively control carbon emissions, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and carbon surplus is becoming an important implication for YRB's agricultural production and ecological restoration in the future. In general, this research is expected to promote a comprehensive and quantitative understanding of the past, present and future of YRB's research.					zhang, zhiliang/IUO-3330-2023; He, Jianqiang/GXN-3764-2022; Yu, Qiang/D-3702-2009	zhang, zhiliang/0009-0001-9306-7989; He, Jianqiang/0000-0002-2094-555X; Yu, Qiang/0000-0001-6950-1821; He, Zhihao/0000-0002-0691-8010													0378-3774	1873-2283				MAR 31	2022	262								107404	10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107404	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107404													WOS:000788796200003

The interrill erodibility (Ki) is quantified by the soil particle size distribution, which is a key parameter in WEPP model. However, the important effects of soil structure on soil erodibility are ignored, which seriously affects the prediction accuracy of the model. In this study, simulated rainfall experiments (60, 90, 120 mm h-1) were performed to improve the prediction equation of interrill erosion incorporating the aggregate instability index (As). Rare earth elements (REEs) were employed as tracers to distinguish interrill and rill erosion on slopes in a box (2 m long, 0.5 m wide, 0.4 m deep) with gradients of 10 degrees, 20 degrees and 30 degrees. The Le Bissonnais method was used to determine the soil aggregate stability. The results showed that aggregate stability played a crucial role in interrill erosion under similar runoff rates. The improved equation contains four parameters, As, runoff rate (q), rainfall intensity (I) and slope gradient (Sf), with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.81 and model efficiency (ME) of 0.79. This equation exhibits greatly improved efficiency in estimating the interrill erosion rate compared to the WEPP model. Furthermore, a new equation incorporating the As, flow velocity (v), flow depth (h) and hydraulic gradient (J) was developed, with R2 of 0.90 and ME of 0.89. This study provides a deeper understanding of the mechanism of interrill erosion and improves upon the physical process-based soil erosion model.

This study aimed to investigate variations of precipitation extremes in China's mainland over 1961-2100 based on 27 newly released General Circulation Models (GCMs) in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) under four shared socioeconomic pathway scenarios (SSPs). 10 extreme precipitation indices (EPIs) were extracted for quantifying changes of precipitation extremes. A statistical downscaling method was applied to downscale original precipitation data from the GCMs. Taylor diagram and interannual variability skill methods were used to evaluate performance of the downscaled GCM data for simulating the EPIs. The results displayed that: (1) The downscaled 27 GCMs performed well for the wet EPIs. Based on the multi-model ensemble results, more severe and frequent precipitation extremes over 2015-2100 were projected. (2) The largest changes in extreme precipitation intensities over 2015-2100 would occur in central and southeast China. The maximum changes in extreme precipitation frequencies would occur in Tibetan Plateau and central and southern China. (3) Precipitation extremes in Xinjiang and Tibetan Plateau would be more sensitive to climate change than other subregions. The future EPI generally have longer than 10-year of primary periods. (4) The GCMs had larger contribution than the SSPs to the uncertainty in projecting the 10 EPIs. (5) CMIP6 models performed better than CMIP5 models in reproducing interannual variations of EPIs. This study supplies useful information to cope with future intensified precipitation extremes in China.																			0169-8095	1873-2895				DEC 15	2022	280								106462	10.1016/j.atmosres.2022.106462	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2022.106462		OCT 2022											WOS:000890914900001

From the aspects of regional "water supply", "water use" and "water demand", the coupling characteristics of water resources and food security were systematically revealed; the new challenges faced by regional food security from the perspective of water resources were clarified; and effective ways to promote the utilization of regional water resources and the sustainable development of grain production were explored. This paper took Northwest China, which is the most arid region, where water-resource utilization and food security are in contradiction, as the research area. The water-resource load index, the water footprint of grain production and the water-consumption footprint were used to quantify the regional water-resource pressure index, as well as the residential grain-consumption types, population urbanization, the industrial-grain-processing industry and their corresponding water-consumption footprints from 2000 to 2020. The coupling characteristics of water resources and food security were systematically revealed. The results showed the following: (1) In 2000-2020, the water-resource load index increased from 4.0 to 10.7, and the load level increased from III to I. At the same time, agricultural water resources were largely allocated elsewhere. (2) During the period, the food rations showed a significant decreasing trend, and the average annual reduction was 3.4% (p < 0.01). The water footprint of animal products increased, particularly for beef and poultry (the average annual growth rates were 9.9% and 6.3%, respectively). In addition, the water footprint of industrial food consumption increased by 297.1%. (3) With the improvement of the urbanization level, the water-consumption footprint increased by 85.9%. It is expected that the water footprint of grain consumption will increase by 39.4% and 52.3% by 2030 and 2040, respectively. Exploring how to take effective measures to reduce the water footprint to meet food-security needs is imperative. This study proposed measures to improve the utilization efficiency of blue and green water and reduce gray water and the grain-consumption water footprint from the aspects of regional planting-structure optimization potential, water-saving irrigation technology, dietary-structure transformation and virtual water trade; these measures could better relieve the water-resource pressure and promote the sustainable development of grain production and water-resource utilization.

Nonetheless, it is important to understand these relationships to maintain soil health and ensure sustainable land use, especially in the current "plastic age. " This case study explored how different particle sizes (20, 200, and 500 mu m) and concentrations (up to 6%) of polypropylene microplastics affect the hydraulic properties of three soil textures (loam, clay, and sand). The results show that addition of microplastic reduced the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) of the three soils by 69.79%, 77.11%, and 95.79%, respectively. These observed adverse effects of microplastics on the infiltration properties of the three studied soils were influenced by particle size, with larger particles having the weakest effect. Furthermore, microplastic addition reduced the water retention capacity of the clay to a greater extent than that of the loam and sand. In the case of clay, the slope of the water characteristic curve (SWRC) increased significantly, whereas the saturated water content (theta s) and residual water content (theta r) curves decreased significantly. Importantly, the interaction between microplastics and soil alters the soil pore-size distribution and reduces pore availability. Overall, this case study demonstrates the impact of microplastic on the hydraulic properties of different soil textures, which can inform management strategies to minimize the adverse effects of microplastic accumulation on yields where plastics are used in agricultural production.

This research aimed to advance an approach for building correction equations to remove measurement errors in designed sediment concentration range. Experimental data of sediment measurement from the stirring-sampling method, with four representative soils, under the designed sediment concentrations (1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 20, 50, 80, 100, 200, 500, 800, and 1000 kg/m3) were used to demonstrate the correction methodological process. Two correction methods (step-wise correction and universal correction) were suggested for the trial in this study based on the distribution of measurement errors. In the step-wise correction, the correction equations were made with a series of linear functions without intercept for the low concentration group (0-20 kg/m3), a series of linear functions with intercept for the high (20-200 kg/m3) and extremely high (200-1000 kg/m3) concentration groups, consecutively. The correction equations were a series of power functions in the universal correction. For the step-wise correction, most of the relative errors of correction sediment concentrations were smaller than 15% and 10% under high and extremely high concentration groups, but the corrected accuracy was not good in the sediment concentration of 1, 2, 5 kg/m3 with the corrected relative errors of 0.20%-206.07%. For the universal correction, the corrected relative errors (0.19%-31.81%) of the four soils were low under the condition of extremely high sediment concentrations, but other corrected accuracies weren't good with the corrected relative errors of 0.68%-1154.71%. The corrected accuracy of step-wise correction is higher than that of the universal correction, but the universal correction is more convenient. These results indicated that the correction equations could efficiently revise the measurement errors of the tested soils and that this method can be generalized to other soil types and was meaningful in monitoring soil erosion.																			1934-6344	1934-6352				NOV	2022	15	6					134	142		10.25165/j.ijabe.20221506.6972	http://dx.doi.org/10.25165/j.ijabe.20221506.6972													WOS:000906828500001

However, the role of raindrop temperature in aggregate disintegration is unclear. The aims of this study are to investigate the effects of raindrop temperatures on soil aggregate disintegration and to evaluate their effects on the contribution of slaking and mechanical striking to splash erosion. Deionized water and ethanol (95%) were employed as rain-drop materials to quantify the effects of raindrop temperature on the contributions of slaking and mechanical striking to splash erosion. Raindrop temperatures were set to 2 & DEG;C, 10 & DEG;C and 20 & DEG;C, and the rainfall heights were set to 0.5 m, 1.0 m and 1.5 m. The results showed that the splash erosion rate decreased with increasing tem-perature in the Loam1 and Loamy sandy. The breakdown rate decreased with increasing temperature in ethanol tests. The influence of temperature on slaking was greater than that on mechanical striking. The contribution rates of mechanical striking and slaking decreased and increased with increasing temperature, respectively. Slaking contributed more to aggregate disintegration at 10 & DEG;C and 20 & DEG;C, while mechanical striking was the primary contributor at 2 & DEG;C in the Loam2 and Loamy sandy. The results provided a deeper understanding of the mechanism of splash erosion and contributed to improving soil erosion prediction models.					Elbasit, Mohamed A. M.

It is worth mentioning that no comprehensive study has been done so far on the overall change of LULC within the surrounding of Desa'a forest areas. This study aimed at analyzing the LULC changes and driving factors in Desa'a forest through Landsat images (i.e., 1973 (MSS), 1986 (TM), and 2015 (OLI)) and maximum likelihood supervised classification. Post classification pixel to pixel comparison was also performed to detect changes from year to year. Finally, focus group discussions were made to identify the LULC change drivers and support the computer-based classifications accuracy. Results demonstrated that both dense (54.11%) and open forest (28.48%) in 1973 covered almost 83% of the total forest area while only 17% was covered by grasslands (10%), farmland (3%), and bare land (4%). This is despite the fact that woody vegetation covered only 39% of the total forest reserve in 2015. During the study period, almost 54,000 ha of grasslands and open and dense forests have been converted to either bare land or farmland, of which 48,163 ha were previously open dense forests. Continuing with such a trend will lead to more severe deforestation and it is necessary to identify and modify the driving variables in Desa'a forest. The results also showed that fire, agricultural expansion, grazing and browsing effect, drought, extraction of wood, and lack of government attention are the major deforestation driver in Desa'a forest. The results of this study can provide a practical perspective for land use planners to manage LULC changes, reduce greenhouse gases, and enhance the biodiversity conservation in the region. In addition, the findings of the current study could provide a perfect source for calculations and choosing the best policy-making decisions to protect and manage plans for Desa'a forest.

Sugarcane leaf photosynthetic light responses and their difference between varieties under high temperature stress	PHOTOSYNTHETICA												Leaf photosynthetic light response (PLR) of six sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) varieties with a high sugar content was measured in the field. PLR curves were fitted by the rectangular hyperbola (RH) model, the nonrectangular hyperbola (NRH) model, and the Ye model, respectively. Photoinhibition occurred under warm and humid environment for all tested sugarcane varieties except for GT02-467 with the photosynthetic rate reduced significantly. The Ye model was the best for PLR curve fitting, especially when photoinhibition occurred. Nearly all PLR parameters estimated by the Ye model were better than the other two models. Some PLR parameters correlated with each other. A significant negative correlation was found between the photoinhibition coefficient and the photosaturation coefficient. The varieties with high light-use efficiency (e.g., YZ99-91 and YZ01-1413) are suitable for dense planting under warming climate, while the varieties with strong ability for dim light use (e.g., GT02-467 and MT69-421) would be appropriate for planting at a high density under warming and dimming climate in the future.

Despite its importance, accurate estimation of large-scale SM remains a challenge. Here we leverage the strength of neural network (NN) and fidelity of long-term measurements to develop a daily multilayer cropland SM dataset for China from 1981 to 2013, implemented for a range of different cropping patterns. The training and testing of the NN for the five soil layers (0-50 cm, 10-cm depth each) yield R-2 values of 0.65-0.70 and 0.64-0.69, respectively. Our analysis reveals that precipitation and soil properties are the two dominant factors determining SM, but cropping pattern is also crucial. In addition, our simulations of alternative cropping patterns indicate that winter wheat followed by fallow will largely alleviate the SM depletion in most parts of China. On the other hand, cropping patterns of fallow in the winter followed by maize/soybean seem to further aggravate SM decline in the Huang-Huai-Hai region and southwestern China, relative to prevalent practices of double cropping. This may be due to their low soil porosity, which results in more soil water drainage, as opposed to the case that winter crop roots help maintain SM. This multilayer cropland SM dataset with granularity of cropping patterns provides an important alternative and is complementary to modeled and satellite-retrieved products.

We hypothesized that this herb would improve the meat quality of lambs. To test this hypothesis, 24 Tan ewe-lambs (27.7 +/- 0.45 kg) were offered diets containing 0 (CON), 100 (AS100), 200 (AS200) and 300 (AS300) g A. squarrosum/kg DM, and average daily gain, carcass traits, blood metabolites, meat quality and fatty acid profiles were determined. Drip loss % and cooking loss % decreased with the AS100 and AS200 diets (P < 0.05). Dietary A. squarrosum reduced muscle fiber area and diameter and increased density of the meat (P < 0.05), which indicated that the meat was more tender. The concentrations of C10:0 and C18:1n-9 t were 1ower and of C17:0 and C18:3n-3 were greater in the AS200 and AS300 treatments than CON (P < 0.05). Our results suggest that feeding lambs up to 200 g/kg DM of A. squarrosum can increase the water-holding capacity and L* value of meat without compromising growth. Further research is needed to determine the optimal level.

This has led to the development of cost-effective, resource-efficient, and environmentally clean rice production systems by optimizing water and nitrogen (N) use. Hence, a 2-year field study (2019 and 2020) was conducted at the ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, to assess the effect of precision N and water management strategies on growth, land, and water productivity, as well as energy-use efficiency in scented direct-seeded rice (DSR). Two crop establishment methods, conventional-till DSR (CT-DSR) and zero-till DSR (ZT-DSR) along with three irrigation scenarios (assured irrigation (irrigation after 72 h of the drying of surface water), irrigation at 20% depletion of available soil moisture (DASM), and 40% DASM+Si (80 kg ha(-1))) were assigned to the main plots; three N management options, a 100% recommended dose of N (RDN): 150 kg ha(-1); Nutrient Expert (R)(NEC)+leaf color chart (LCC) and NE (R)+soil plant analysis development (SPAD) meter-based N management were allocated to sub-plots in a three-time replicated split-plot design. The CT-DSR produced 1.4, 11.8, and 89.4, and 2.4, 18.8, and 152.8% more grain yields, net returns, and net energy in 2019 and 2020, respectively, over ZT-DSR. However, ZT-DSR recorded 8.3 and 10.7% higher water productivity (WP) than CT-DSR. Assured irrigation resulted in 10.6, 16.1 16.9, and 8.1 and 12.3, 21.8 20.6, and 6.7% higher grain yields, net returns, net energy, and WP in 2019 and 2020, respectively, over irrigation at 20% DASM. Further, NE (R)+SPAD meter-based N management saved 27.1% N and recorded 9.6, 18.3, 16.8, and 8.3, and 8.8, 21.7, 19.9, and 10.7% greater grain yields, net returns, net energy, and WP over RDN in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Thus, the study suggested that the NE (R)+SPAD-based N application is beneficial over RDN for productivity, resource-use efficiency, and N-saving (similar to 32 kg ha(-1)) both in CA-based and conventionally cultivated DSR. This study also suggests irrigating DSR after 72 h of the drying of surface water; however, under obviously limited water supplies, irrigation can be delayed until 20% DASM, thus saving two irrigations, which can be diverted to additional DSR areas.

To comprehensively evaluate and screen the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of six selected BMPs, we integrated the entropy weight method with the calibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The results demonstrate that (i) the hybrid use of the SWAT model and the entropy weight method can affordably help refine existing and future BMPs. Watershed management plans should be adjusted according to the wet season and critical source areas (CSAs) because all BMPs show differences in the reduction efficiency of soil erosion under different hydrological seasons and CSAs. (ii) Agricultural BMPs and tree planting can effectively control soil erosion; the reduction rankings in the whole watershed were as follows: > 15 degrees returning farmland to forest (32.16%), residue cover tillage (25.06%), strip tillage (16.43%), > 25 degrees returning farmland to forest (8.96%), contour tillage (8.75%), and no tillage (3.18%). The reduction in soil erosion in the wet season was 17.62 times higher than that in the dry season. Priority and reasonable allocation of BMPs in the wet season can be made according to the timely situation and local conditions of the Yanhe River watershed. (iii) The reduction effects of various BMPs on soil erosion in different CSAs are different. The highest comprehensive evaluation index of both efficacy and cost-effectiveness among the six BMPs was scored by residue cover tillage, which we recommend to be popularized in CSAs of the Yanhe River watershed. In areas with different erosion intensities, strip tillage was also highly efficient, that is, the cost was low, and the reduction effect adequate; hence, it is also suitable for large-scale popularization. Some cultivated lands on the > 15 slope can be selectively returned to forest, supplemented by conservation tillage practices such as strip tillage, residue cover tillage, and contour tillage. The introduced framework can be adapted as a suitable tool for selecting cost-effective conservation practices in different regions by managing efficacy and cost trade-offs.					li, jinfeng/GVS-5425-2022; Ma, Xiaoyi/HJH-6205-2023; Wu, Lei/JDC-4172-2023; wu, lei/D-3286-2017	wu, lei/0000-0002-5602-674X													0378-3774	1873-2283				MAY 1	2022	265								107546	10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107546	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107546		FEB 2022											WOS:000792801600004

It is often estimated based on some meteorological factors but seldom takes total cloud cover into consideration. In this study, cloud cover data are used to establish models, compared with other regular models for estimating diffuse radiation in different climatic zones of China during 1992?2015. The results showed that the performance of the new model based on sunshine fraction (n/N), clearness index (kt), total cloud cover (CI), air temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH), wind speed and the day of the year outperformed other models and further improved the predictive accuracy. Generally, the kd models based on the single kt was generally more precise compared with single n/N-based or single CI-based models. And models on the basis of multiple factors performed better than the single factor-based model. Comparisons between these models indicated that neural network models (with the largest R and smallest RMSD values) provided better overall accuracy than other models. The parameter of CI as the co-factor can improve the prediction of diffuse radiation. The models developed and evaluated in this study can contribute to developing and utilizing solar energy in China, especially in areas without diffuse radiation records.

Evaluation in a Mediterranean Grassland	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The coupling of radiative transfer, energy balance, and photosynthesis models has brought new opportunities to characterize vegetation functional properties from space. However, these models do not accurately represent processes in ecosystems characterized by mixtures of green vegetation and senescent plant material (SPM), in particular grasslands. These inaccuracies limit the retrieval of vegetation biophysical and functional properties. Green and senesced plants feature contrasting spectral properties and carry out different functions that current coupled models do not represent separately. Besides, senescent pigments' absorption features change as SPM decomposes, and neither is this process well parameterized in radiative transfer models. This manuscript aims at overcoming these limitations. On the one hand, we have developed senSCOPE, a version of the Soil-Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) that separately represents light interaction and physiology of green and senesced leaves. On the other, we have characterized new specific absorption coefficients of senescent pigments (K-s) from optical measurements of SPM from a Mediterranean grassland. Sensitivity analyses revealed that compared to SCOPE, senSCOPE 1) predicts variables that respond more linearly to the faction of green leaf area; and 2) keeps high levels of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation in the green leaves, which leads to significant differences in leaf photosynthesis, non-photochemical quenching, and transpiration. Moreover, we compared SCOPE vs. senSCOPE's capability to provide estimates of functional and biophysical parameters of vegetation. We assimilated different combinations of reflectance factors (R), chlorophyll sun-induced fluorescence radiance in the O-2-A band (F-760), gross primary production (GPP), and thermal radiance (L-t) measured in a Mediterranean grassland. Besides, we compared the role of three different sets of K-s coefficients in the inversion of senSCOPE, two estimated from SPM. The performance of the inversions was assessed using field data and a pattern-oriented model evaluation approach. Unlike SCOPE, senSCOPE provided unbiased estimates of chlorophyll content (C-ab) during the dry season. The use of SPM-specific K-s improved the representation of R in the near-infrared wavelengths; and, consequently, the estimation of leaf area index (LAI). Compared with field LAI, the coefficient of determination R-2 increased from similar to 0.4 to similar to 0.6, depending on the inversion constraints. Compared with SCOPE, the new model and coefficients together reduced the root mean squared error between observed and modeled R (similar to 40%), F-760 (similar to 30%), and GPP (similar to 5%). Both models failed to represent L-t; in this case, senSCOPE featured larger uncertainties. The modeling approach we propose improves the simulation and retrieval of vegetation properties and function in grasslands. Further work is needed to test the applicability of senSCOPE in different ecosystems, improve the simulation of the thermal spectral domain, and better characterize the optical parameters of SPM. To do so, new databases of SPM optical and biophysical properties should be produced.

The ant Formica manchu is active on the nest surface and prefers a hot, dry environment; therefore, warming may provide a favourable environment for its activities. We hypothesized that F. manchu benefit from warming and mitigate the negative effects of warming on litter decomposition. We examined the effects of ant nests (nest absence versus nest presence) and warming (+1.3 and +2.3 & DEG;C) on litter decomposition, soil properties and the plant community in alpine grassland. Decomposition stations with two mesh sizes were used to differentiate effects of microorganisms (0.05 mm) and macroinvertebrates (1 cm) on decomposition. Ant nests increased litter decomposition with and without macroinvertebrates accessing the decomposition station when compared to plots without ant nests. Only litter decomposition in ant nests with macroinvertebrates having access to the decomposition station was not affected negatively by warming. Plots with ant nests had greater soil carbon, nutrient contents and plant growth than plots without ant nests, regardless of warming.

Consequently, a management strategy in alpine grasslands should include the protection of these ants and ant nests.

It results in increasing areas of land degradation, which further threaten the productive potential of landscapes. Consistent and continuous erosion monitoring will help identify the location, magnitude, and trends of soil erosion. This information can then be used to evaluate the impact of land management practices and inform programs that aim to improve soil conditions. In this study, we applied the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and the Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWEQ) to simulate water and wind erosion dynamics. With the emerging earth observation big data, we estimated the monthly and annual water erosion (with a resolution of 90 m) and wind erosion (at 1 km) from 2001 to 2020. We evaluated the performance of three gridded precipitation products (SILO, GPM, and TRMM) for monthly rainfall erosivity estimation using ground-based rainfall. For model validation, water erosion products were compared with existing products and wind erosion results were verified with observations. The datasets we developed are particularly useful for identifying finer-scale erosion dynamics, where more sustainable land management practices should be encouraged.

However, the magnitudes of the effects of multiple global change factors on leaf gas exchanges are currently lacking. Therefore, a global meta-analysis of 337 published articles was conducted to determine the effects of elevated CO2 (eCO(2)), elevated O-3 (eO(3)), elevated temperature (eT), and drought on plant leaf gas exchanges. The results indicated that (1) the overall responses of photosynthesis rate (P-n) and instantaneous water use efficiency (WUEi) to eCO(2) increased by 28.6% and 58.6%. But transpiration rate (T-r) and stomatal conductance (g(s)) responded negatively to eCO(2) (- 17.5% and - 17.2%, respectively). Furthermore, all P-n, g(s), and WUEi responded negatively to eO(3) (- 32.7%, - 24.6%, and - 27.1%), eT (- 23.2%, - 10.8%, and - 28.9%), and drought (- 53.6%, - 59.3%, and - 4.6%, respectively), regardless of functional groups and various complex experimental conditions. (2) Elevated CO2 increased WUEi combined with eO(3), eT, and drought (26.6%, 36.0%, and 58.6%, respectively, for eCO(2) + eO(3), eCO(2) + eT, and eCO(2) + drought) and mitigated their negative impacts on P-n to some extent. (3) Plant form and foliage type play an important role in the responses of leaf gas exchanges. Trees responded mostly to eCO(2), but responded least to eT in P-n, T-r, g(s), and WUEi compared with shrubs and herbs. Evergreen broad-leaved species were more responsive to eCO(2) and drought. (4) The stress level of each factor can also significantly influence the responses of leaf gas exchanges to environment change. Hopefully, the quantitative results are helpful for the further assessments of the terrestrial carbon-water cycle.

However, the knowledge on how the loss of plant functional groups impacts multitrophic interactions across soil biota and associated ecological functioning knowledge is lacking. This study aimed to evaluate responses of soil nematode communities to PFG (Gramineae, Cyperaceae, Leguminosae, and other Forbs) identity and richness loss after 9 years by comparing 15 treatments. Specifically, the loss of PFG richness significantly decreased carbon biomass and the abundance of bacterivores and negatively affected footprints of bacterivores and omnivore-predators (OP), leading to a decline in the enrichment and structure footprints. The response of nematode community structure and functional composition at different trophic levels to PFG richness loss varied with PFG identity. Gramineae removal reduced the community structural footprint positively associated with the biomass carbon and footprint of OP, suggesting carbon and energy enrichment are likely to be lower in soil micro-food webs. Although the removal of Cyperaceae reduced carbon biomass and the footprint of bacterivores, it did not cause significant shifts in carbon and energy enrichment and structural footprints in the soil food web, similar to the other two PFGs. Notably, Gramineae strongly controlled carbon and energy enrichment regulations in soil micro-food webs than other PFGs. The present study highlights the key role and influence of PFG richness and identification on food web ecosystem services. It provides a basis for the development of sustainable strategies for grazed alpine meadow ecosystem's management.					li, bai/JNE-1502-2023; Wang, Chao/JHT-6081-2023; chen, wenjing/IZE-8536-2023; li, xiang/JCN-9316-2023; xuan, li/JNI-7432-2023; Wang, Jiacheng/ABE-5948-2020	WANG, jie/0009-0004-1824-7244													0929-1393	1873-0272				OCT	2022	178								104566	10.1016/j.apsoil.2022.104566	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2022.104566													WOS:000835659700011

Hall; Wang, Deli			Large herbivores facilitate a dominant grassland forb via multiple indirect effects	ECOLOGY												While large herbivores are critically important components of terrestrial ecosystems and can have pronounced top-down effects on plants, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving these effects remains incomplete. Large herbivores can alter plant growth, reproduction, and abundance through direct effects (predominantly consumption) and through indirect effects via altered interactions with abiotic factors and other species. We know considerably less about these indirect effects than the direct effects. Here, we integrate medium- and small-scale field experiments to investigate how a large vertebrate herbivore, cattle (Bos taurus), affects the aboveground biomass of a dominant forb species, Artemisia scoparia, via diverse direct and indirect pathways in a temperate grassland in northeast China. Although cattle consumed this forb, its biomass increased significantly in response to grazing, due to multiple indirect positive effects that outweighed the direct negative effects of consumption. Cattle preferentially consumed the competing grass Leymus chinensis, and altered Artemisia microhabitats by reducing total plant cover and litter biomass and by increasing the abundance of co-occurring ant species (e.g., Formica spp. and Lasius spp.). This led to additional indirect positive effects on A. scoparia likely due to (1) increased light availability in understory layers and other limiting resources (e.g., soil nutrients and moisture) caused by removal of competitors and plant litter at the soil surface and (2) the changes in resource availability (e.g., soil nutrients and moisture) associated with ant colonies. Our results show that large herbivores can affect plant growth not only via direct consumption, but also via multiple indirect effects. Focusing on the causes and consequences of herbivore-induced indirect effects will not only help us to better understand the influence of these animals in ecological systems, but will also lead to more effective land management and conservation practices in the regions they inhabit.					liu, kaiyuan/JHU-0258-2023; Li, xiaofei/GXF-7187-2022; li, xiao/HJP-5134-2023; Vázquez, Diego/ACN-8759-2022; smit, christian/B-9817-2008; li, xiao/HKV-8405-2023; zhao, yujie/JLL-1283-2023; LI, XIAO/IQV-9318-2023	smit, christian/0000-0002-4044-9473; 													0012-9658	1939-9170				APR	2022	103	4							e3635	10.1002/ecy.3635	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3635		MAR 2022						35060616					WOS:000763882700001
J	Bai, XJ; Huang, YM; Wang, BR; Kuzyakov, Y; An, SS				Bai, Xuejuan; Huang, Yimei; Wang, Baorong; Kuzyakov, Yakov; An, Shaoshan			Belowground allocation and fate of tree assimilates in plant-soil-microorganisms system: <SUP>13</SUP>C labeling and tracing under field conditions	GEODERMA												Although forests account for only 27% of the total land area, they store approximately 80% of the aboveground carbon (C) and 40% of soil C globally. However, there is currently little information regarding the input and distribution of photoassimilates of trees in plant-soil systems. To quantify the belowground C input and allocation to plant-soil pools, we pulse labeled 5-year-old pioneer (Populus davidiana) and climax (Quercus wutaishanica) species with (CO2)-C-13 under field conditions. The C-13 allocation dynamics were traced in the leaves, branches, roots, and soil microorganisms, rhizosphere and bulk soil under Populus davidiana and Quercus wutaishanica over 21 days. C-13 recovery (% of assimilated C-13) in the leaves of Populus davidiana and Quercus wutaishanica decreased from nearly 90% at 6 h after labeling to 40% and 45% at 21 days, respectively. Continuous assimilate allocation from above- to belowground increased C-13 recovery in roots from 0.4% at 6 h after labeling to 9.5% in Populus davidiana and from 1.5% to 15% in Quercus wutaishanica at 21 days after labeling. The recently assimilated C was detected in the soil immediately after labeling. The C-13 amounts in the bulk and rhizosphere soil of the climax species Quercus wutaishanica was two-fold greater than that under the pioneer species Populus davidiana. The total belowground net C input (including that in roots) by Populus davidiana and Quercus wutaishanica was 109 and 283 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (top 20 cm of soil), respectively, including rhizodeposition of 4.2 and 28 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Consequently, the belowground C allocation and soil C sequestration increase from pioneer to climax tree species.

However, properties and toxicity associated with environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) in such emissions are not well known. This paper investigated the characteristics and cytotoxicity of soot-associated EPFRs discharged from Chinese household stoves. Our results showed that the concentrations of EPFRs were related to fuel types, and they were higher in wood-burning soot (8.9-10.5 X 10(16) spins/g) than in coal-burning soot (3.9-9.7 X 10(16) spins/g). Meanwhile, EPFR concentrations in soot decreased with an increase of coal maturity. The soot EPFRs, especially reactive fractions, readily induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Potential health effects of soot EPFRs were also examined using normal human bronchial epithelial cell line 16HBE as a model. Soot particles were internalized by 16HBE cells inducing cytotoxicity. The main toxicity inducers were identified to be reactive EPFR species, which generated ROS inside human cells. Our findings provided valuable insights into potential contributions of soot EPFRs associated with different types of fuel to health problems. This information will support regulations to end or limit current stove usage in numerous households.

However, few studies have evaluated the available water-holding capacity (AWHC) and plant-available water storage (PAWS) for plant growth or determined the saturation of available soil water (SASW) in deep profiles (> 2m). This study investigated characteristics of AWHC and PAWS to a depth of 5 m along a revegetation and precipitation gradient on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). The results showed that AWHC(5) (m) exhibited a decreasing trend along the transect, with a mean value of 762.9 mm. PAWS(5) (m) first decreased, then increased following changes in vegetation types with a mean value of 257.3 mm. The PAWS(5) (m) significantly differed under different soil layers and showed high variation (coefficient of variation = 88.0%) in its profile. AWHC(5) (m) was significantly correlated with all environmental factors except slope aspect and slope gradient. A comparative analysis showed that PAWS(5) (m) had a small portion of AWHC(5) (m), both of which varied among different vegetation species. Variations in PAWS(5) (m) and AWHC(5) (m) were higher in the 450-550 mm precipitation zone and silt loam soil. Planted forests with deep root systems introduced in the 450-550 mm precipitation zone had lower SASW(5) (m) values than the areas with shallow root vegetation. A complete understanding of the spatial variations of PAWS, AWHC, and SASW along the revegetation and precipitation gradient will be helpful in assessing regional water resources and optimizing vegetation species on the CLP and possibly in other water-limited regions around the world.

Degradation of alpine grassland is widespread on the Tibetan Plateau and sown grassland has become one of the main strategies for grassland restoration. However, the diversity and community structure of ANF bacteria in different grassland types remain unknown. The aim of this study was to fill this gap. Soil samples were obtained from 39 grassland plots selected from three counties in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. The plots were classified as natural grassland (NG), sown grassland (SG), lightly degraded grassland (LDG), and severely degraded grassland (SDG). ANF microbial communities of the four grassland types were compared at the level of community and species diversity by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing technology. The phylum Proteobacteria accounted for >72% of the ANF bacteria. The community structures of soil ANF bacteria differed significantly (p < 0.01) among grassland types. We concluded that: (1) planting gramineous forage could possibly mitigate the decrease in diversity of soil ANF bacteria caused by grassland degradation; and (2) the diversity of soil ANF bacteria in alpine grassland of the Tibetan Plateau is closely related to grassland degradation and restoration.

Being affected by different climate forcing factors (forcings), SWC is spatially and temporally variable, occurring at various intensities and scales. We compared scale-specific controls on SWC in a sub-humid and a semiarid climate zone based on a multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) method in conjunction with a multivariate dataset, including SWC (collected separately seven times within five soil layers to a depth of 500 cm) and eight measured climate forcing factors (i.e., precipitation, temperature, normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), elevation, clay, silt, sand and soil organic carbon (SOC)). We also identified the percent variance of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and residuals relative to the original data. Two to three IMFs of SWC were further obtained in the two climate zones. IMFs explained the percent variance of SWC (79.3%), NDVI (77.3%), clay content (76.6%) and SOC (93.9%) to the original data in the sub-humid climate zone, while residuals from all environmental variables (except for SOC) yielded most of the total variance (55.5-93.2%) in the semiarid climate zone. Correlations between the two climate zones exhibited different IMF characteristics (scales) and different climatic conditions. Forcings of the two climate zones also played different roles in controlling SWC. Precipitation and temperature controlled large-scale SWC in both climate zones, namely, NDVI had an inverse effect on SWC between the two climate zones, SOC had a moderate and large-scale effect on SWC in the sub-humid climate zone and clay content had a comparatively critical effect on SWC in the semiarid climate zone. Scale-specific controls of soil properties on SWC were depth dependent in the sub-humid climate zone, while similar characteristics were obtained among the five soil layers in the semiarid climate zone. The specific scale dependence of SWC and relevant forcings were similar regardless of soil water condition (dry or wet). Our results offer insight into relationships between SWC and the main forcings of two different regional climate zones and their scale-dependent controls.

The changed distribution area of an ecosystem is one of the key criteria in such assessments. The Stipa bungeana grassland is one of the most widely distributed grasslands in the warm-temperate semi-arid regions of China. However, the total distribution area of this grassland was noted to have shrunk and become fragmented because of its conversion to cropland and grazing-induced degradation. Following the IUCN-RLE standards, here we analyzed changes in the geographical distribution of this degraded grassland, to evaluate its degradation and risk of collapse. Past (1950-1980) distribution areas were extracted from the Vegetation Map of China (1:1,000,000). Present realizable distribution areas were equated to these past areas minus any habitat area losses. We then predicted the grassland's present and future (under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario) potential distribution areas using maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt), based on field survey data and nine environmental layers. Our results showed that the S. bungeana grassland was mainly distributed in the Loess Plateau, Hexi Corridor, and low altitudes of the Qilian Mountains and Longshou Mountain. This ecosystem occurred mainly on loess soils, kastanozems, steppe aeolian soils and sierozems. Thermal and edaphic factors were the most important factors limiting the distribution of S. bungeana grassland across China. Since 56.1% of its past distribution area (4.9x10(4) km(2)) disappeared in the last 50 a, the present realizable distribution area only amounts to 2.2x10(4) km(2). But only 15.7% of its present potential distribution area (14.0x10(4) km(2)) is actually occupied by the S. bungeana grassland. The future potential distribution of S. bungeana grassland was predicted to shift towards northwest, and the total area of this ecosystem will shrink by 12.4% over the next 50 a under the most pessimistic climate change scenario. Accordingly, following the IUCN-RLE criteria, we deemed the S. bungeana grassland ecosystem in China to be endangered (EN). Revegetation projects and the establishment of protected areas are recommended as effective ways to avert this looming crisis. This empirical modeling study provides an example of how IUCN-RLE categories and criteria may be valuably used for ecosystem assessments in China and abroad.

However, due to climatic variability and field data limitations, uncertainties remain regarding the influence of ERW on food security and soil carbon pools in temperate regions. This study focused to evaluate the crop productivity and carbon sequestration potential of farmland ERW in China by conducting field monitoring in different humid regions and ERW performance model. Additionally, the contribution of climate, soil, and management factors to ERW-mediated yield and carbon sequestration changes was explored using random forest and correlation networks. Field monitoring indicated that farmland ERW significantly improved crop yield in humid region (13.5 & PLUSMN; 5.2 %), along with notable improvements in soil pH and available nutrients. Precipitation (10.4-16.7 %) and soil pH (9.7-16.8 %) had the highest contribution on ERW mediated yield and carbon sequestration changes, but the contribution of management factors (24-26.2 %), especially N input (2.7-7.0 %), should not be disregarded. The model evaluation demonstrated that the carbon sequestration rate of farmland ERW in China can reach 0.28-0.40 Gt yr  1, thereby presenting an opportunity to expand and accelerate the nationally determined contributions of China. The mean sequestration cost of farmland ERW was 633 & PLUSMN; 161 CNY yen t-CO2  1, which was an attractive sequestration price considering the positive benefits of rock powder on soil pH and nutrients. Deploying ERW in acidified and mineral nutrient deficient regions was able to serve as an alternative to lime and part chemical fertilizers to improve yield and maximize agricultural sustainability and resource co-benefits. Farmland ERW also has the potential to resource silicate waste to assist traditional, difficult-to-decarbonize industries to reduce carbon emissions. As a result, a comprehensive assessment of existing artificial silicate waste materials could further expand the application of farmland ERW.

Yaks (Bos grunniens) graze at higher altitudes than Qaidam cattle (Bos taurus), but the two bovine species co-graze in their overlapping ranges. We hypothesized that yaks would digest nutrients to a greater extent and utilize energy more efficiently than cattle at low dietary intakes, but the difference between bovine species would not be apparent at high intakes. To test this hypothesis, six yaks (203 +/- 6.0 kg) and six Qaidam cattle (214 +/- 9.0 kg), all 3.5-year-old castrated males, were used in two concurrent 4 x 4 Latin square designs with two extra steers of each species in each period. The digestibilities of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, ether extract, neutral and acid detergent fiber were greater (p < 0.05) in yaks than in cattle and decreased linearly (p < 0.05) when feed level (FL) increased. The average daily gain (ADG), the ratios of digestible energy (DE) to gross energy and metabolizable energy (ME) to DE, and ruminal total volatile fatty acids and ammonia-N concentrations were greater (p < 0.001) in yaks than in cattle and increased linearly (p < 0.001) when FL increased. Based on the regression equations of ADG on ME intake, the daily ME requirement for maintenance in yaks was 0.53 MJ BW-0.75 d(-1), which was lesser (p < 0.05) than the 0.62 MJ BW-0.75 d(-1) in cattle. We concluded that: (1) when differences between breeds emerged, the differences existed for all FLs; (2) maintenance energy requirement was lesser and ADG was greater in yaks than in cattle; (3) the digestibilities of nutrients were greater in yaks than in cattle when consuming only oat hay pellets. These findings indicate that yaks adapt to fluctuating dietary intakes in harsh environments by having a low energy requirement and high digestibility of nutrients, independent of the FL.

Alternate partial root-zone drip irrigation (APRD) is an innovative water-saving drip irrigation technology. However, the coupling effects of water and nitrogen (N) supply under APRD on crop growth, water and N use efficiency, as well as the utilization and fate of residual nitrates accumulated in the soil profile are not clear. A simulated soil column experiment where 30-40 cm soil layer was (NO3)-N-15-labeled as residual nitrate was conducted to investigate the coupling effects of different water [sufficient irrigation (W-1), two-thirds of the W-1(W-2)] and N [high level (N-1), 50% of N-1 (N-2)] supplies under different irrigation modes [conventional irrigation (C), APRD (A)] on tomato growth, irrigation water (IWUE) and N use efficiencies (NUE), and the fate of residual N. The results showed that, compared with CW1N1, AW(1)N(1) promoted root growth and nitrogen absorption, and increased tomato yield, while the N absorption and yield did not vary significantly in AW(2)N(1). The N absorption in AW(2)N(2) decreased by 16.1%, while the tomato yield decreased by only 8.8% compared with CW1N1. The highest IWUE appeared in AW(2)N(1), whereas the highest NUE was observed in AW(2)N(2), with no significant difference in NUE between AW(2)N(1) and CW1N1 at the same N supply level. The N-15 accumulation peak layer was almost the same as the originally labeled layer under APRD, whereas it moved 10-20 cm downwards under CW1N1. The amount of N-15 accumulated in the 0-40 cm layer increased with the decreasing irrigation water and nitrogen supply, with an increase of 82.9-141.1% in APRD compared with that in CW1N1. The utilization of the N-15 labeled soil profile by the tomato plants increased by 9-20.5%, whereas the loss rate of N-15 from the plant-soil column system decreased by 21.3-50.1% in APRD compared with the CW1N1 treatment. Thus, APRD has great potential in saving irrigation water, facilitating water use while reducing the loss of residual nitrate accumulated in the soil profile, but has no significant effect on the NUE absorbed.

The microbial community plays an important role in the functional stability of alpine grassland ecosystems. Therefore, it is important to understand how the microbial community structure of grassland ecosystems changes under different herbivore grazing assemblages to ensure their sustainable development. To fill this gap, a field study was carried out to investigate the effects of YG, SG, and MG on plant communities, soil physico-chemical properties and microbial communities under moderate grazing intensity in alpine meadows. Grazing increased the beta-diversity of the bacteria community and decreased the beta-diversity of the fungal community. The herbivore assemblage affected the microbial community diversity, but not the plant community diversity. Total phosphorus, soil bulk density, root biomass, and plant alpha-diversity were correlated with both the bacterial and fungal community composition, available phosphorus and soil moisture were correlated only with the bacterial community composition, while available potassium and above-ground net primary production (ANPP) were correlated only with the fungal community composition. Soil available nitrogen, soil available phosphorus and soil bulk density were highest in SG, while ANPP was highest in MG. It was concluded that MG can improve ANPP and stabilize the soil microbial community, suggesting that MG is an effective method for sustainable use and conservation of alpine meadows on the QTP.

The genetic basis of Al-tolerance in chickpea remains unclear. Here, we assessed the Al-tolerance of 8 wild Cicer and one cultivated chickpea (PBA Pistol) accessions by measuring the root elongation in solution culture under control (0 mu M Al3+) and Al treatments (15, 30 mu M Al3+). Compared to PBA Pistol, the wild Cicer accessions displayed both tolerant and sensitive phenotypes, supporting wild Cicer as a potential genetic pool for Al-tolerance improvement. To identify potential genes related to Al-tolerance in chickpea, genome-wide screening of multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) encoding genes was performed. Fifty-six MATE genes were identified in total, which can be divided into 4 major phylogenetic groups. Four chickpea MATE genes (CaMATE1-4) were clustered with the previously characterized citrate transporters MtMATE66 and MtMATE69 in Medicago truncatula. Transcriptome data showed that CaMATE1-4 have diverse expression profiles, with CaMATE2 being root-specific. qRT-PCR analyses confirmed that CaMATE2 and CaMATE4 were highly expressed in root tips and were up-regulated upon Al treatment in all chickpea lines. Further measurement of carboxylic acids showed that malonic acid, instead of malate or citrate, is the major extruded acid by Cicer spp. root. Protein structural modeling analyses revealed that CaMATE2 has a divergent substrate-binding cavity from Arabidopsis AtFRD3, which may explain the different acid-secretion profile for chickpea. Pangenome survey showed that CaMATE1-4 have much higher genetic diversity in wild Cicer than that in cultivated chickpea. This first identification of CaMATE2 and CaMATE4 responsive to Al3+ treatment in Cicer paves the way for future functional characterization of MATE genes in Cicer spp., and to facilitate future design of gene-specific markers for Al-tolerant line selection in chickpea breeding programs.

IWAs were further submitted to the genebank of International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), Mexico. 2,403 IWAs from CIMMYT's genebank were assayed by DArT-seq technology to assess genetic diversity. No apparent ecogeographic patterns related to genetic diversity were detected, probably due to long-term transport and frequent interchange of landraces among farmers. A multivariate clustering procedure combining genotypic and phenotypic information was used in selecting a core-set, which represented 15% of the hexaploid wheat accessions included in this study. This subset captured an estimated 93% of rare (frequency <0.05) alleles. Multisite phenotypic data (India, Mexico) validated the ability of the core-set in detecting useful variants. Potential donor accessions for multiple traits (disease resistance, zinc concentration) were identified from the core-set for wheat-breeding. This report illustrates a breeder friendly robust core-set formulation strategy for harnessing the useful genetic variation stored in the genebanks.

Applications	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Soybean (Glycine max L.) is gaining in importance due to its many uses, including as a food crop and a source of industrial products, among others. Increasing efforts are made to accelerate soybean research and develop new soybean varieties to meet global demands. Soybean research, breeding, identification, and variety protection all rely on precise genomic information. While DNA markers are invaluable tools for these purposes, the older generations, especially those developed before the advent of genome sequencing, lack precision and specificity. Thankfully, advancements in genome sequencing technologies have generated vast amounts of sequence data over the past decade, allowing precise and high-resolution analyses. However, making sense of the genomic information requires a certain level of professional training and computational power, which are not universally available to researchers. To address this, we generated a set of PCR-based DNA markers out of the existing genomic data from 228 popular soybean varieties that offer precise, unambiguous genomic information and can be easily adapted in various applications. A standard operating procedure (SOP) was also designed for these markers and validated on diverse soybean varieties to ensure their reproducibility. This user-friendly universal panel of DNA markers, along with the SOP, will facilitate soybean research and breeding programs through simple applications.

S.; Solanki, Iswhar S.; Steinke, Jonathan			Crop variety management for climate adaptation supported by citizen science	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Crop adaptation to climate change requires accelerated crop variety introduction accompanied by recommendations to help farmers match the best variety with their field contexts. Existing approaches to generate these recommendations lack scalability and predictivity in marginal production environments. We tested if crowdsourced citizen science can address this challenge, producing empirical data across geographic space that, in aggregate, can characterize varietal climatic responses. We present the results of 12,409 farmer-managed experimental plots of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in Nicaragua, durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) in Ethiopia, and bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in India. Farmers collaborated as citizen scientists, each ranking the performance of three varieties randomly assigned from a larger set. We show that the approach can register known specific effects of climate variation on varietal performance. The prediction of variety performance from seasonal climatic variables was generalizable across growing seasons. We show that these analyses can improve variety recommendations in four aspects: reduction of climate bias, incorporation of seasonal climate forecasts, risk analysis, and geographic extrapolation. Variety recommendations derived from the citizen science trials led to important differences with previous recommendations.					de Sousa, Kauê/AAX-5396-2020; Dell'Acqua, Matteo/B-4728-2017	de Sousa, Kauê/0000-0002-7571-7845; Dell'Acqua, Matteo/0000-0001-5703-8382; van Etten, Jacob/0000-0001-7554-2558; Kidane, Yosef Gebrehawaryat/0000-0002-6876-7158; Steinke, Jonathan/0000-0001-5742-702X; GUPTA, Arnab/0000-0002-5672-5735; Fadda, Carlo/0000-0003-3075-6207													0027-8424					MAR 5	2019	116	10					4194	4199		10.1073/pnas.1813720116	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1813720116								30782795					WOS:000460242100045

Thirty-six, 7-month old wether Tan lambs (initial body weight, 35.0 +/- 1.66 kg) were assigned into one of six groups (n = 6) in a randomized complete block design. The experiment was a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement of treatments. The lambs were either not supplemented (control) or supplemented (RPLM) with 4.5 g/ day rumen protected Lys plus 1.5 g/day rumen protected Met and combined with three FLs (1.0, 0.8 and 0.6 voluntary intake -VI). The basal diet, on a dry matter (DM) basis, consisted of 400 g/ kg forage and 600 g/kg concentrate. The average daily gain (ADG) increased linearly (P < 0.05) with increasing FL, and ADG was greater (interaction, P = 0.01) and the DM intake to ADG ratio was lesser (interaction, P = 0.04) in RPLM than control lambs in the 0.8 VI and 1.0 VI FLs, but not in the 0.6 VI FL. Digestibilities of DM, organic matter, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber decreased linearly (P < 0.01) with increasing FL. Concentrations of total volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and butyrate and the acetate:propionate ratio increased linearly with increasing FL (P < 0.05). In addition, concentrations of propionate and iso-VFAs were greater (P < 0.05); whereas, of butyrate and the acetate: propionate ratio were lesser (P < 0.05) in RPLM than control lambs. Daily faecal-N output and N-retention were greater (interaction, P < 0.05) in RPLM than control lambs in the 1.0 VI and 0.8 VI FLs, but not in the 0.6 VI FL. In addition, microbial-N (MN) and the efficiency of microbial protein synthesis increased linearly (P < 0.01) with increasing FL and MN was greater (P = 0.02) in RPLM than in control lambs. Serum glucose concentration increased linearly (P < 0.01) with decreasing FL and was greater (P < 0.01) in RPLM than in control lambs. It was concluded that supplementary RPLM at 1.0 VI and 0.8 VI could improve ADG, feed conversion, and N-balance in growing Tan lambs and could be beneficial for sheep fed a low protein diet.																			0377-8401	1873-2216				SEP	2021	279								115024	10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2021.115024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2021.115024		JUL 2021											WOS:000691546700015

This study analyzed spatiotemporal characteristics of five types of AMDs (drought, flood, hail, low-temperature freezing and snow (LTFS), and typhoon) in China, assessed the impacts of AMDs on meteorological yield, and explored the influences of extreme climate on AMDs and meteorological yield. The results demonstrated that the total covered rate of AMDs generally showed a decreasing trend from 1978 to 2020 in China. The covered rates of drought, flood, and hail had significant downward trends, while the covered rates of the LTFS and typhoons had insignificant increasing trends. The AMDs' structure in different regions obviously changed after 2010. In addition, Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the covered rates of drought, flood, and typhoon were affected by the extreme precipitation indicators, and hail and LTFS were affected by the extreme temperature indicators. The increases of extreme temperature led to the decrease of the meteorological yield, while the effect of extreme precipitation on meteorological yield varied from region to region. This study provides significant references for guiding disaster mitigation.

The present study evaluated the effects of herbal root extracts from three traditional Chinese medicinal herbs as dietary supplements on dry matter intake (DMI), average daily gain (ADG), rumen fermentation and ruminal microbiota in early weaned yak calves (Poephagus grunniens). Twenty, four-month old weaned yak calves (72.3 +/- 3.65 kg) were divided into four groups, matched for bodyweight and sex (n = 5 per group), and received either no supplement (control group) or 80 mL/kg DMI of herbal root extracts of Angelica sinensis, Codonopsis pilosula or Glycyrrhiza uralensis. The water extract (similar to 170 mL) was mixed with 300 g concentrate and offered to the calves each day for 60 days following a 14-day adaptation period. Dry matter intake did not differ among treatments, but ADG was highest for calves fed Codonopsis pilosula root extract (P = 0.026). Compared with control calves, calves fed root extract of Glycyrrhiza uralensis had a higher ruminal proportion of propionate (P = 0.034), calves fed root extracts of Codonopsis pilosula and Glycyrrhiza uralensis had higher ruminal proportions of isovalerate (P = 0.032) and calves fed root extract of Glycyrrhiza uralensis had a lower acetate:propionate ratio (P = 0.027) on d 30. Calves consuming Angelica sinensis, Codonopsis pilosula and Glycyrrhiza uralensis root extract had lower ruminal NH3-N concentrations than control calves on d 60 (P < 0.05). The abundances of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes comprised over 90 % of the total phyla in the four groups. Yak calves consuming Glycyrrhiza uralensis root extract had the highest abundance of Bacteroidetes (P = 0.009) and lowest abundance of Firmicutes (P = 0.023). Calves consuming Codonopsis pilosula root extract had the highest abundances of Proteobacteria (P = 0.035) and Actinobacteria (P = 0.007), while calves consuming the three herbal root extracts tended to have lower abundances of Kiritimatiellaeota (P = 0.082), Spirochaetes (P = 0.081) and Synergistetes (P = 0.058) than control calves. In conclusion, consuming Codonopsis pilosula root extract increased ADG in early weaned yak calves, while consuming the three herbal root extracts increased ruminal proportions of propionate and isovalerate, and altered rumen microbiota. Supplementary Codonopsis pilosula proved to be the most beneficial of the three herbal roots for the early weaned calves.

Our current investigation was oriented to establish a minimum data set (MDS) of soil quality indicators through the selection of apt scoring functions for each indicator, thus evaluating soil quality in the Himalayan foothills. The experiment was conducted during two consecutive years, viz. 2016 and 2017, and comprised of 13 treatments encompassing different combinations of chemical fertilizers, organic manure, and biofertilizers, viz. (i) the control, (ii) 20 kg P + PSB (Phosphorus solubilizing bacteria), (iii) 20 kg P + PSB + Rhizobium, (iv) 20 kg P + PSB + Rhizobium+ FYM, (v) 20 kg P + 0.5 kg Mo + PSB, (vi) 20 kg P + 0.5 kg Mo + PSB + Rhizobium, (vii) 20 kg P + 0.5 kg Mo + PSB + Rhizobium + FYM, (viii) 40 kg@ P + PSB, (ix) 40 kg P + PSB + Rhizobium, (x) 40 kg P + PSB + Rhizobium+ FYM, (xi) 40 kg P + 0.5 kg Mo + PSB, (xii) 40 kg P + 0.5 kg Mo + PSB + Rhizobium, and (xiii) 40 kg P + 0.5 kg Mo + PSB + Rhizobium + FYM. Evaluating the physical, chemical, and biological indicators, the integrated module of organic and inorganic fertilization reflected a significant improvement in soil characteristics such as the water holding capacity, available nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and molybdenum, different carbon fractions and soil biological characteristics encircling microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and total bacterial and fungal count. A principal component analysis (PCA) was executed for the reduction of multidimensional data ensued by scoring through the transformation of selected indicators. The soil quality index (SQI) established for different treatments exhibited a variation of 0.105 to 0.398, while the magnitude of share pertaining to key soil quality indicators for influencing soil quality index encircled the water holding capacity (WHC), the dehydrogenase activity (DHA), the total bacteria count, and the available P. The treatments that received an integrated nutrient package exhibited a higher SQI (T10-0.398; T13-0.372; T7-0.307) in comparison to the control treatment (T1-0.105). An enhanced soil quality index put forth for all organic treatments reflected an edge of any conjunctive package of reduced synthetic fertilizers with prime involvement of organic fertilizers over the sole application of inorganic fertilizers.

An important agricultural production base was selected, a total of 251 topsoil samples were collected, eight toxic elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, Zn) in soil were analyzed, and environmental and health risk assessments were conducted. Results showed that all concentrations of eight elements in soil samples were lower than the risk screening values with negligible pollution risk. Approximately 83.8% of Hg in soil was originated from atmospheric deposition related to industrial emissions, 53.2% of Cd was derived from direct industrial activities, and the other elements came from soil parent materials or agricultural activities. Accumulation risk of As in agricultural products, potential ecological risk from Cd, and As's ingestion risk and Cr's dermal contact risk should be paid more attention. More stricter monitoring and coping countermeasures and strategies should be established to ensure the sustainable development of agriculture.

We conducted a controlled trial using a randomized block design with 10 Tan lambs fed a control diet (CD) and 10 Tan lambs fed a pelleted diet containing 8% GP (dry matter basis) for 46 days. Rumen, jejunum, cecum, and colon bacterial and archaeal composition were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Dry matter intake (DMI) was greater (p < 0.05) in the GP than CD group; however, there was no difference in average daily gain (ADG, p < 0.05) and feed conversion ratio (FCR, p < 0.05) between the two groups. The GP group had a greater abundance of Prevotella 1 and Prevotella 7 in the rumen; of Sharpe, Ruminococcaceae 2, and [Ruminococcus] gauvreauii group in the jejunum; of Ruminococcaceae UCG-014 and Romboutsia in the cecum, and Prevotella UCG-001 in the colon; but lesser Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group in the rumen and cecum, and Ruminococcaceae UCG-005 and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010 in the colon than the CD group. The pathways of carbohydrate metabolism, such as L-rhamnose degradation in the rumen, starch and glycogen degradation in the jejunum, galactose degradation in the cecum, and mixed acid fermentation and mannan degradation in the colon were up-graded; whereas, the pathways of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle VIII, and pyruvate fermentation to acetone in the rumen and colon were down-graded with GP. The archaeal incomplete reductive TCA cycle was enriched in the rumen, jejunum, and colon; whereas, the methanogenesis from H-2 and CO2, the cofactors of methanogenesis, including coenzyme M, coenzyme B, and factor 420 biosynthesis were decreased in the colon. The study concluded that a diet including GP at 8% DM did not affect ADG or FCR in Tan lambs. However, there were some potential benefits, such as enhancing propionate production by microbiota and pathways in the GIT, promoting B-vitamin production in the rumen, facilitating starch degradation and amino acid biosynthesis in the jejunum, and reducing methanogenesis in the colon.					wang, wenjuan/JGD-0428-2023	Cheng, Xindong/0000-0001-7760-1654														1664-302X				SEP 28	2023	14								1264840	10.3389/fmicb.2023.1264840	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1264840								37840727					WOS:001083366700001

The impact of fires used for slash-and-burn on forest edge effects remains unclear. Here, using high-resolution satellite-based forest-cover and biomass datasets, we find that edge effects extend a median distance and an interquartile range of 0.11(-0.04)(+0.06) km and 0.15(-0.05)(+0.09) km into moist and dry forests, and biomass within the forest edge zones has a carbon deficit of 4.1 PgC. Fires occurred in 52% of the forest edges and increased the carbon deficit by 5.5(-2.9)(+4.3) MgC ha(-1), compared with non-fire edges, through both the direct impact of fires intruding into forests and the indirect impact of changes in the local atmospheric circulations increasing canopy dryness. If small-scale slash-and-burn practices continue, increased fragmentation during 2010-2100 will result in a carbon loss from edge effects of 0.54-4.6 PgC. Fragmentation-caused forest degradation could be avoided by implementing dedicated forest protection policies supported by satellite monitoring of forest edges.

Remote sensing of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has emerged as a promising approach to approximating GPP across ecosystems, but its capability for tracking GPP in evergreen mangroves has not been assessed. The SIF-GPP link at a subtropical mangrove and its environmental controls are explored using 1-year time-series measurements from tower-based hyperspectral and eddy covariance systems. Both the relationship between SIF and GPP as well as that between SIFy (SIF yield: the ratio of SIF over absorbed photosynthetically active radiation [APAR]) and LUE (light use efficiency: the ratio of GPP over APAR) at diurnal and seasonal time scales are analyzed. The temporal variations of SIF and GPP shared overall similar changing patterns, but their functional relationship tended to be time scale-dependent. Midday depressions in SIF were observed when environmental stresses occurred around noon (including excess light and high VPD), and the strength of the SIF-GPP link was affected by changing environmental conditions. The SIFy-LUE relationship was temporally more dynamic, tending to match during midday hours but diverge from each other during morning and afternoon hours. These findings confirm SIF can serve as a potential remotely sensed indicator of mangrove canopy photosynthesis. This paper provides the first, high temporal-resolution, continuous SIF measurements in mangroves, and highlights the importance of the impacts of environmental conditions on the SIF-GPP relationship.

However, little information exists regarding the response of soil respiration to precipitation variation. To examine the response of soil respiration to precipitation variation through biogeochemical regulation, a manipulative field experiment was conducted along a precipitation gradient (-60%, -40%, -20%, CK = natural precipitation, + 20%, +40% and +60%) in a native desert grassland ecosystem in Inner Mongolia. Plant biomass, total soil carbon and soil respiration were determined across the precipitation treatments during the growing season (from late May to early October) in 2017. Above-ground biomass tended to increase but total soil carbon varied little with an increase in precipitation. Soil respiration exhibited a unimodal curve diurnally in all precipitation treatments, peaking between 09:00 and 13:00, but showed irregular patterns seasonally. Both the daily and seasonal average soil respirations increased with an increase in precipitation (diurnal Rs ranged from 0.37 mu mol m(-2)S(-1 )to 0.75 mu mol m(-2)S(-1); seasonal Rs ranged from 0.43 mu mol m(-2)S(-1) to 0.66 mu mol m(-2)S(-1)). Soil respiration was correlated positively with precipitation-induced change in above-ground plant biomass, but was correlated negatively with precipitation-induced change in total soil carbon. It was concluded that carbon released from the soil increases with an increase in precipitation.

The Loess Plateau in China, is known for its severe soil erosion and distinctive loess deposits, with soil nutrient levels declining from southeast to northwest. However, little is known about the relative effects of different host plants on soil microbial communities under different environmental stress in the Loess Plateau. We investigated the microbial community within soil profiles (0-100 cm) under two types of grasses community (Agropyron cristatum and Stipa spp.) with different drought tolerances, which are widely distributed in three different climate regions of the Loess Plateau. The diversity, composition, community assembly, and predicted functions of the bacterial and fungal community were evaluated. We discovered that the climate-plant-soil microbe interactions were the most significant factor affecting the community composition of bacteria and fungi on the regional scale. In addition, the effects of edaphic factors (e.g., soil organic carbon [SOC], total nitrogen [TN], and total phosphorus [TP]) on the soil bacterial and fungal communities increased from the warm-temperate to the desert steppe environment. Furthermore, the microbial community and assembly processes were driven by TP content of Agropyron grass, which is more resistant to environmental stress, while the soil of Stipa grass was driven by SOC. This may have occurred because the soil microbes in the Agropyron grassland had a stronger ability to utilize refractory organic matter thus reducing dependence on SOC, compared to soil microbes in the Stipa grassland. Collectively, our results show that the soil microbes recruited by the different plant communities responded differently in microbial composition, assembly, and functions to adapt the environmental stress change.

Maternal rumen and milk microbiota shape the establishment of early-life rumen microbiota in grazing yak calves	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE												Early-life gut microbial colonization and development exert a profound impact on the health and metabolism of the host throughout the life span. The transmission of microbes from the mother to the offspring affects the succession and establishment of the early-life ru-men microbiome in newborns, but the contributions of different maternal sites to the rumen microbial estab-lishment remain unclear. In the present study, samples from different dam sites (namely, oral, rumen fluid, milk, and teat skin) and rumen fluid of yak calves were collected at 6 time points between d 7 and 180 post-partum to determine the contributions of the different maternal sites to the establishment of the bacterial and archaeal communities in the rumen during early life. Our analysis demonstrated that the dam's microbial communities clustered according to the sites, and the calves' rumen microbiota resembled that of the dam consistently regardless of fluctuations at d 7 and 14. The dam's rumen microbiota was the major source of the calves' rumen bacteria (7.9%) and archaea (49.7%) compared with the other sites, whereas the potential sources of the calf rumen microbiota from other sites varied according to the age. The contribution of dam's rumen bacteria increased with age from 0.36% at d 7 to 14.8% at d 180, whereas the contribution of the milk microbiota showed the opposite trend, with its contribution reduced from 2.7% at d 7 to 0.2% at d 180. Maternal oral archaea were the main sources of the calves' rumen archaea at d 14 (50.4%), but maternal rumen archaea became the main source gradually and reached 66.2% at d 180. These findings demonstrated the potential microbial transfer from the dam to the offspring that could influence the rumen microbiota colonization and establishment in yak calves raised under grazing regimens, providing the basis for future microbiota manipulation strategies during their early life.

The intake of energy and amino acids, especially lysine and methionine, of grazing, lactating yaks are often below requirements and this could explain, at least in part, the low milk yield. We hypothesized that grazing, lactating yaks, supplemented with energy and/or amino acids, would improve their performance and the average daily gain (ADG) of their calves. Twenty-four multiparous yaks (218 +/- 5.3 kg), blocked by bodyweight, were offered one of four dietary treatments (n = 6 yaks per treatments) as: 1) no supplement (CON); 2) 15.0 g/d rumen-protected lysine plus 5.0 g/d rumen-protected methionine (SA); 3) 1.20 kg/d concentrate (SC); and 4) both SA and SC (SAC). The ADG was greater (P < 0.001) in yaks with than without supplementary concentrate, whereas the greatest ADG for calves was in the SAC group (interaction, P = 0.034). The concentration of ruminal total volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and of butyrate increased (P < 0.01) in yaks with supplementary concentrate, whereas iso-VFAs increased (P < 0.01) in yaks with supplementary rumen-protected lysine plus methionine (RPLM). The relative abundances of the ruminal bacteria Prevotella brevis and Ruminococcus albus increased (P < 0.01) in yaks with supplementary concentrate or RPLM, with the greatest abundance (interaction, P < 0.05) in the SAC group. Milk yield from hand-milking, and the concentrations of fat, protein, total solids and urea were not affected by dietary supplements, but lactose concentration increased (P = 0.021) with concentrate supplementation, whereas somatic cell count decreased (P < 0.01) when yaks received either supplementary concentrate or RPLM. Milk lysine and methionine, as proportions of total amino acids (TAAs), and concentration of TAAs increased with supplementary concen-trate or RPLM. The milk concentrations of C16:1, C18:2n-6c and C18:3n-6 increased (P < 0.05) in yaks supplemented with concentrate, whereas, the concentrations of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids were not affected (P > 0.05) by treatments. These results indi-cated that the ADG of calves improved, whereas the rumen fermentation capacity of the lactating yaks was enhanced with supplementary concentrate and RPLM. It was concluded that dietary supplements could be an effective management option to improve performance in grazing, lactating yaks and the ADG of their calves raised on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.					li, jiaxin/JNT-5073-2023; Zhou, Jianwei/JPW-9256-2023														0008-6223	1873-3891				MAR 5	2023	205								115591	10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2023.115591	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2023.115591		FEB 2023											WOS:000927356200001

Its medicinal properties have been studied in mice and human, but the nutritional value and metabolic function of the above-ground parts as a ruminant feed ingredient have not been reported. Here, we find that supplementing lamb diets with A. squarrosum reduced blood lipids, enhanced immunity and anti-inflammatory capacities, and mediated lipid metabolism in adipose tissue and adipocytes of Tan lambs. These findings have provided strong evidence that A. squarrosum has the potential to be used as a beneficial dietary supplement for ruminants. Agriophyllum squarrosum (sand rice), a widespread desert plant, possesses anti-hyperglycemic and anti-inflammatory properties, and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for many years. However, its effects on ruminants are unknown. To fill this gap, we examined the effects of A. squarrosum on the immune and anti-inflammatory responses of lambs. A total of 23, 6-month-old Tan ewe-lambs (27.6 +/- 0.47 kg) were divided into four groups and offered a basic diet (C-control), or a diet that contained 10%, 20%, or 30% A. squarrosum, on a dry matter basis, for 128 days. Serum concentrations of total cholesterol were lower (p = 0.004) in the 30% supplemented lambs than controls, while concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were lower (p = 0.006) in the 10% and 20%, but not in 30% supplemented lambs than controls. Serum-cortisol concentrations were lower (p = 0.012) in the 30% supplemented lambs and free fatty acid concentrations were higher in the 10% and 20% supplemented lambs than in control lambs (p < 0.001). Supplementation with A. squarrosum decreased (p < 0.05) the area of adipocytes in subcutaneous adipose tissue, but there was no difference between the 20% and 30% diets. Conversely, the area in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) increased (p < 0.05), especially for the 10% and 20% supplemented diets. Supplementation with A. squarrosum also enriched immune and anti-inflammatory related and lipid and glucose-metabolic pathways and associated differentially expressed gene expressions in adipose tissue. A total of 10 differential triacylglycerol, 34 differential phosphatidylcholines and seven differential phosphatidylethanolamines decreased in the diet with 30% supplementation, when compared to the other diets. Finally, adipocyte-differentiation genes, and immune and inflammatory response-related gene expression levels decreased in lamb adipocytes cultured with an aqueous A. squarrosum extract. In conclusion, supplementing lamb diets with A. squarrosum reduced blood lipids, enhanced immunity and anti-inflammatory capacities, and mediated lipid metabolism in adipose tissue and adipocytes of Tan lambs. A level of approximately 10% is recommended, but further research is required to determine the precise optimal level.					wang, wenjuan/JGD-0428-2023; Ma, Xiaofei/ABB-5302-2022	Ma, Xiaofei/0000-0001-9456-0065; Degen, Allan/0000-0003-4563-6195													2076-2615					DEC	2022	12	24							3486	10.3390/ani12243486	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani12243486								36552407					WOS:000900361700001

In this study, we focused on environmental changes, that is, natural disasters and human activities, in the Poyang Lake Basin over the past 2000 years, to analyze interactions between land use cover changes and human activities from the perspective of regional sustainable development. We collected historical records of climate and hydrology, floods and droughts, and rivers and lakes in the Poyang Lake area, and established time sequences for the floods and droughts, lake water level and lake area, amount of farming land, and population, in order to discuss interactions between changes in the environment and the climate, with emphasis on the impacts of extreme events on lake and river basin environment changes. The following results were obtained. First, climate changes in historical periods had wide-ranging and far-reaching impacts on agricultural production, especially disasters caused by climate change. Among the changes in the Poyang Lake basin environment, including river network systems, lake water levels, etc., changes in lake water volume are direct evidence of climate change, adaptation to climate change, and obvious phased characteristics. Second, in the process of changes to the lake and river network in the Poyang Lake Basin, social and economic development is accompanied by evolution of the lake. Increases and decreases in population, the scale of agricultural production, and lake environment changes have direct and significant interactions. Third, the Poyang Lake basin's environmental changes during the historical period are mainly reflected in the pressure feedback mode of "population-agriculture" in the lake environment.

Following the synthesis of GG-HAP composite by a simple chemical precipitation method, the various analyses were employed to understand the crystallinity, morphology, chemical composition, surface functionality and internal bonding, etc. From the comparison of physical properties among the sintered and unsintered GG-HAP composites and that too with different concentrations of GG (1%, 5%, and 10%), we observed the superior properties for the samples formed from higher GG concentration (10%) with sintering. We observed the lowest crystal size of 30 nm with 95% crystallinity, a surface area of 108 m(2)/g, a total pore volume of 0.2 mL/g, an average pore diameter of 33 angstrom for the Sin-10% GG-HAP composite. In addition, the biocompatibility test performed on the Sin-GG-HAP pellet confirmed the in-built bioactivity and biostability of the composites in simulated body fluid. Further, the Naringenin drug delivery profiles confirmed for the stable and controlled release of loaded drug from the Sin-GG-HAP composites (with 1, 5, and 10% of GG). We observed the highest release of 96% from the Sin-10% GG-HAP matrix in just 90 min and T-50% of 416 h, and a mean diffusion time period of 459 h. Finally, the antimicrobial (using both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria) and cytotoxic activities (with the use of healthy normal and diseased cells) of the drug-loaded and un-loaded GG-HAP composites confirm the potential role of the formed Sin-10% GG-HAP composite towards biomedical applications.

The impact of k(d) on LUE should be considered in crop models to accurately evaluate the effect of radiation changes on crop production. However, the magnitude of the k(d) effect is difficult to quantify because of the complicated interacting relationships among all of the meteorological parameters, as well as the changing effects for various ecosystem types and research sites. Eight site-years of flux data and two years of diffuse radiation data from two field ecosystems in the North China Plain were used to (1) compare the performance of five k(d) models, (2) explore the impacts of environmental factors on LUE and gross primary production (GPP) of winter wheat (Triticum aestivium L.), and (3) quantify the relationships between k(d) and both LUE and GPP of winter wheat. Comparison results showed that the k(d) model developed by Boland et al. performed the best of the five models evaluated. This model was chosen to calculate k(d) in this research. Path analysis show that k(d) was the main factor affecting LUE of winter wheat, explaining up to 55% of the variability in LUE. The relationship between k(d) and LUE was significantly linear (slope of about 0.326 g C mol(-1)). GPP initially increased and then decreased with increasing kd. A moderate radiation condition (k(d) = 0.53) was favorable for increasing GPP. The effect of k(d) on LUE should be added in the LUE module of APSIM-Nwheat to improve simulation accuracy. The results of this study highlight the importance of k(d) in correctly modeling LUE for winter wheat with a crop model and provide quantitative relationships between these two parameters. These relationships will be helpful in improving crop model simulation accuracy under changed climate conditions.

While the area under afforestation has increased globally during the last 20 years, the dynamics of SOC accumulation due to afforestation are still poorly known, as it cannot be directly compared to that in cropland. The goals of this study were: i) to investigate the dynamics of SOC accumulation after afforestation on the Loess Plateau; ii) to determine SOC contents and distribution in density fractions and aggregates most strongly affected by afforestation; and iii) to analyze the relationships between old and new SOC in relation with afforestation periods. A chronosequence of forest plots aged 1, 5, 12 (with Chinese pine, Pinus tabulaeformis Carr.) and 30 years (with white poplar, Popidus alba L.) were selected within the large scale "Grain for Green" project. A maize field nearby was chosen as a control, which represents the land use prior to afforestation. At each location, soils were sampled at depths of 0-10 and 10-30 cm, respectively and aggregates were fractionated into < 250, 250-2000 and > 2000 mu m sizes, which were subsequently separated into light (rho < 1.85 g cm(-3)) and heavy (rho > 1.85 g cm(-3)) density fractions. SOC content was generally higher in afforested soils than in cropland and increased with stand age. The mean SOC accumulation rate was 0.11 g C kg(-1) year(-1) for the 0-10 cm layer of the 30-year-old forests, whereas the maximum rate was found for 5-year-old forest at 0.24 g C kg(-1) year(-1). For each period of afforestation, the maximum SOC content was recorded in the macroaggregates. The C turnover of the light fraction (calculated based on delta C-13 of SOC) peaked in the large macroaggregates and ranged from 21 to 23 years). Whereas SOC turnover in the heavy fraction, peaked in the microaggregates at a relatively longer period of 46 to 70 years. We conclude that the initial SOC accumulation under afforestation occurs mainly in the macroaggregates, with a faster turnover compared with microaggregates. During the first 30 years of afforestation, the SOC accumulation and stabilization is ongoing mainly in the upper 10 cm, while the C sequestration in 10 to 30 cm depth needs much longer time.

The supply of photo-assimilation to ovaries plays a significant role in the overall grain development. However, whether ovary abortion induced by soil water deficit (SWD) during ear differentiation is correlated with photo-assimilation supply is not clear. This study investigated if occurrence of SWD before silking suppresses ovary development and photo-assimilation supply. In 2018 and 2019, water deficit effects on controlled field-grown maize plants were surveyed from jointing to silking (ear differentiation stage) stages on ovary development, anthesis and silking interval (ASI), leaf and canopy photo-assimilation including SPAD, photosynthetic index, net photosynthetic rate, leaf area index (LAI), net assimilation rate (NAR), and yield and its components. Four SWD treatments were used: control, mild, moderate, and severe. SWD suppressed plant growth and photo-assimilation supply and increased ASI. Water-deficit significantly decreased the canopy photosynthetic characteristics, while severe SWD additionally decreased LAI and NAR at silking stage by 20 % and 58 % in 2018, and by 17 % and 65 % in 2019. Under water-deficit conditions, the temporal and spatial variation of carbon metabolism in the maize ovaries revealed significantly reduced soluble sugar and starch contents at 20 days after fertilization. Thus, the grain-filling rate was suppressed during initial grain growth stage, and the degree of decrease was positively related with the magnitude of water-deficit stress severity. The soluble sugar and starch contents in the apical ovaries were lower than in ovaries in the middle and basal positions. In 2019, highest ovary abortion frequency at the apical position was recorded, followed by the basal and middle positions, while in 2018 90 % abortion frequency was observed in all the ear positions with severe stress. Under mild, moderate, and severe water-deficit stress conditions, grain number per ear decreased by 26 %, 61 %, and 93 % in 2018, and 9 %, 14 %, and 41 % in 2019, respectively. To address more frequent and intense water-deficit stress events under future changing climate, maize breeding needs to focus on developing drought-tolerant maize varieties with minimal ovary abortion.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014														0378-4290	1872-6852				MAR 15	2023	293								108830	10.1016/j.fcr.2023.108830	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2023.108830		JAN 2023											WOS:000926785500001

However, the interactions between O2 dynamics and the concentration and flux of GHGs during the soil mois-ture transitions under various soil pore conditions have not yet been clarified. In this study, a soil-column experiment was conducted under wetting-drying phases using three pore-structure treatments, FINE, MEDIUM, and COARSE, with 0 %, 30 %, and 50 % coarse quartz sand applied to soil, respectively. The concentrations of soil gases (O2, nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4)) were monitored at a depth of 15 cm hourly, and their surface fluxes were measured daily. Soil porosity, pore size distribution, and pore connectivity were quantified using X-ray computed microtomography. The soil O2 concentrations were found to decline sharply as soil moisture increased to the water holding capacities of 0.46, 0.41, and 0.32 cm cm-3 in the FINE, MEDIUM, and COARSE, respectively. The dynamic patterns of the O2 concentrations varied across the soil pore structures, decreasing to anaerobic in FINE (<0.01 %) and MEDIUM (0.02 %), and to hypoxic (4.42 %) in COARSE. Correspondingly, the soil N2O concen-tration was the highest in FINE (101 & mu;L L-1) and the lowest in COARSE (10 & mu;L L-1), whereas the highest surface N2O flux was observed in MEDIUM (131 & mu;g N m-2 h-1). As soil CO2 concentrations declined, CO2 fluxes increased from FINE to MEDIUM to COARSE. Most pores of FINE, MEDIUM, and COARSE were 15-80 & mu;m, 85-100 & mu;m, and 105-125 & mu;m, respectively, in terms of diameter. The X-ray CT visible (>15 & mu;m) porosity in FINE, MEDIUM and COARSE were 0.09, 0.17, and 0.28 mm3 mm-3, respectively. The corresponding Euler-Poincare numbers were 180,280, 76,705, and -10,604, respectively, indicating higher connectivity in COARSE than in MEDIUM or FINE.In soil dominated by small air-filled porosity which limits gas diffusion and result in low soil O2 concentration, N2O concentration was increased and CO2 flux was inhibited as the moisture content increased. The turning point in the sharp decrease in O2 concentration was found to correspond with a moisture content, and a pore diameter of 95-110 & mu;m was associated with the critical turning point between holding water and O2 depletion in soil. These find-ings suggest that O2-regulated biochemical processes are key to the production and flux of GHGs, which in turn are dependent on the soil pore structure and a coupling relationship between N2O and CO2. Improved understanding of the intense effect of soil physical properties provided an empirical foundation for the future development of mechanis-tic prediction models for how pore-space scale processes with high temporal (hourly) resolution up to GHGs fluxes at larger spatial and temporal scales.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				OCT 15	2023	895								165192	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165192	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165192		JUL 2023						37385503					WOS:001036845900001

Organic farming is advocated as a sustainable solution for ensuring food security without compromising environmental sustainability. However, poor farm productivity quizzed the sustainability of organic production systems. Hence, a field study was carried out in the Sikkim region of the Indian Himalayas to assess the efficacy of conservation-effective tilling and diversified cropping on system productivity, profitability, environmental quality, and soil nutrient balance in organic farming. Three tillage systems, namely, (i) conventional tillage (CT), (ii) reduced tillage (RT), and (iii) zero tillage (ZT), and four maize based diversified cropping systems (maize-black gram-toria, maize-black gram-buckwheat, maize-rajmash-toria, and maize-rajmash-buckwheat) were tested using a three times replicated split-plot design. The ZT system recorded 13.5 and 3.5% higher system productivity over CT and RT, respectively. Of the four diversified cropping systems, the maize-rajmash-buckwheat system recorded the maximum system productivity (13.99 Mg ha(-1)) and net returns (3,141 US$ ha(-1)) followed by the maize-black gram-buckwheat system. Among the tillage practices, ZT recorded the significantly high eco-efficiency index (EEI; 1.55 US$ per kg CO2-eq emission) and the lowest greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI; 0.15 kg CO2-eq per kg production). Of the diversified cropping systems, the maize-rajmash-buckwheat registered the lowest GHGI (0.14 CO2-eq per kg production) and the highest EEI (1.47 US$ per kg CO2-eq emission). Concerning soil nutrient balance, after three cropping cycles, the soil under ZT recorded significantly higher available N (340.0 kg ha(-1)), P (16.6 kg ha(-1)), and K (337.3 kg ha(-1)) over the CT system at 0-10 cm soil depth. Similarly, the soil under the maize-black gram-buckwheat system had the maximum bio-available NPK. Thus, the study suggests that the cultivation of the maize-black gram/rajmash-buckwheat systems under ZT and/or RT would increase farm productivity, profitability, and soil fertility with minimum GHGI in organic farming under the Eastern Himalayan region of India.

However, this has to be done with caution because of the high mortality rate of calves due to the lack of nutrients and the harsh environmental conditions. Twenty-four weaned male yak calves were used in a 60 day feeding trial in which astragalus root extract (ARE) was supplemented. They were assigned randomly to one of four dietary treatments (n= six per treatment) that differed in ARE level: 0 g kg(-1)(control), ARE(0); 20 g kg(-1), ARE(20); 50 g kg(-1), ARE(50;)and 80 g kg(-1)dry matter intake (DMI), ARE(80). RESULTS Final bodyweight and average daily gain (ADG) were significantly higher and the DMI/ADG ratio was significantly lower in calves with ARE supplementation than control (ARE(0)) calves. Ruminal concentrations of acetate and propionate and serum concentration of superoxide dismutase in ARE(80)calves were higher than in the other groups and serum concentration of insulin was higher in ARE(80)calves than in ARE(20)calves. Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) concentrations in ARE-fed calves were higher than in controls. Serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) concentration was higher in ARE(50)and ARE(80)groups than ARE(0)calves and serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentration was higher in ARE(80)than in ARE(0)calves. Serum immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgG and immunoglobulin M (IgM) concentrations increased with age in ARE-fed calves. ARE supplementation increased the abundance of fiber degrading bacteria. CONCLUSION ARE at a dosage of 5% to 8% DMI can be supplemented to early weaned yak calves to improve growth performance, antioxidant capacity and immunity.

However, the 2019-2020 austral spring-summer was an exception, with over four times the previous maximum area burnt in southeast Australian temperate forests. Temperate forest fires have extensive socio-economic, human health, greenhouse gas emissions, and biodiversity impacts due to high fire intensities. A robust model that identifies driving factors of forest fires and relates impact thresholds to fire activity at regional scales would help land managers and fire-fighting agencies prepare for potentially hazardous fire in Australia. Here, we developed a machine-learning diagnostic model to quantify nonlinear relationships between monthly burnt area and biophysical factors in southeast Australian forests for 2001-2020 on a 0.25 degrees grid based on several biophysical parameters, notably fire weather and vegetation productivity. Our model explained over 80% of the variation in the burnt area. We identified that burnt area dynamics in southeast Australian forest were primarily controlled by extreme fire weather, which mainly linked to fluctuations in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), with a relatively smaller contribution from the central Pacific El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Our fire diagnostic model and the non-linear relationships between burnt area and environmental covariates can provide useful guidance to decision-makers who manage preparations for an upcoming fire season, and model developers working on improved early warning systems for forest fires.

Farmland ERW has great CO2 removal potential and is accompanied by various co-benefits, such as improving soil pH and providing mineral nutrients. However, the environment-driven mechanisms of ERW remain unclear, and the uncertainty on crop productivity also requires further evaluation in field trials.OBJECTIVE: We tried to explore the response of crop productivity and soil inorganic carbon to ERW in farmland and analyze the contribution and prioritization of environment drivers for the above change.METHODS: A series of monitoring trials were established in a multi-agroclimatic region in central China from 2019 to 2021. Firstly, crop productivity and SIC change mediated by ERW were evaluated by applying 10 kg m  2 mixed rock powder in field trials. Secondly, the random forest and correlation network analysis were used to quantify the influence of climate, soil, and management drivers on yield and SIC change. Finally, the carbon footprint of silicate rock powder was calculated by life cycle analysis.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Farmland ERW significantly improved the crop yield (7 & PLUSMN; 4.3%) and biomass (11 & PLUSMN; 4.6%) in the whole region. In the low water balance region, the net carbon sequestration during three years caused by ERW was 4.31 & PLUSMN; 0.82 t-CO2 ha  1, which increased the carbon capture of the agricultural system by 1.6-2.4 times. Contribution analysis showed that soil pH had the highest relative importance (18%) on yield change mediated by ERW. Low soil pH was conducive to yield and nutrient effectiveness increases, and the largest yield increase reached 31 & PLUSMN; 6.9%. Water balance (rainfall/evapotranspiration) was the dominant driver affecting (20%) inorganic carbon sequestration, the accumulation of SIC in low water balance reached 3.8 times that in high water balance regions. Moreover, fertilizer input also significantly correlated with ERW field effect, and N input significantly increased the SIC in the arid region.SIGNIFICANCE: This study provided detailed field data for large-scale potential analysis of ERW in farmland. These findings contribute to understanding the environmental influence of ERW and assisting decision-making for ERW layout. Moreover, our results could inspire soil improvement in regions with soil acidification and mineral nutrient shortages.

However, the current understanding of how ecosystem processes will respond to predicted extreme dry and wet years is limited. The current study was conducted for three years field experiment to examine the effects of environmental variables and soil microbes on soil respiration (Rs), autotrophic respiration (Ra) and heterotrophic respiration (Rh) under extreme wet and dry conditions in mowed and unmowed grassland of Inner Mongolia. Across treatments (i.e. control, dry spring, wet spring, dry summer and wet summer), the mean of Rs was increased by 24.9 % and 24.1 % in the wet spring and wet summer precipitation treatments, respectively in mowed grassland. In other hand, the mean of Rs was decreased by -22.1 % and -3.5 % in dry spring and dry summer precipitation treatments, respectively in mowed grassland. The relative contribution of Rh and Ra to Rs showed a significant (p < 0.05) change among simulated precipitation treatments with the highest value (76.18 %) in wet summer and 26.41 % in dry summer, respectively under mowed grassland. Rs was significantly (p < 0.05) affected by the interactive effect of extreme precipitation and mowing treatments in 2020 and 2021. The effects of precipitation change via these biotic and abiotic factors explained by 52 % and 81 % in Ra and Rh, respectively in mowed grassland. The changes in microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) had significant (p < 0.05) direct effects on Rh in both mowed and unmowed grasslands. The influence of biotic and abiotic factors on Rs was stronger in mowed grass-lands with higher standardized regression weights than in unmowed grassland (0.78 vs. 0.69). These findings high-light the importance of incorporating extreme precipitation events and mowing in regulating the responses of C cycling to global change in the semiarid Eurasian meadow steppe.

An understanding of the major sources of uncertainty in yield change is needed to develop strategies to reduce the total uncertainty. Here, we simulated rain-fed wheat cropping at four representative locations in China and Australia using eight crop models, 32 global climate models (GCMs) and two climate downscaling methods, to investigate sources of uncertainty in yield response to climate change. We partitioned the total uncertainty into sources caused by GCMs, crop models, climate scenarios and the interactions between these three. Generally, the contributions to uncertainty were broadly similar in the two downscaling methods. The dominant source of uncertainty is GCMs in Australia, whereas in China it is crop models. This difference is largely due to uncertainty in GCM-projected future rainfall change across locations. Our findings highlight the site-specific sources of uncertainty, which should be one step towards understanding uncertainties for more robust climate-crop modelling. Understanding major sources of uncertainty in yield change facilitates adaptation strategies for cropping systems. Using eight crop models, 32 global climate models and two climate downscaling methods, it is shown that their relative contribution to uncertainty in climate-crop modelling depends on location.

We compared Tibetan and Small-tailed Han sheep (n24 of each breed), all wethers and 1 center dot 5 years of age, which were each divided randomly into four groups and offered diets of different digestible energy (DE) densities: 8 center dot 21, 9 center dot 33, 10 center dot 45 and 11 center dot 57 MJ DE/kg DM. When the sheep lost body mass and were assumed to be in negative energy balance: (1) adipocyte diameter in subcutaneous adipose tissue was smaller and decreased to a greater extent in Tibetan than in Small-tailed Han sheep, but the opposite occurred in the visceral adipose tissue; (2) Tibetan sheep showed higher insulin receptor mRNA expression and lower concentrations of catabolic hormones than Small-tailed Han sheep and (3) Tibetan sheep had lower capacity for glucose and fatty acid uptake than Small-tailed Han sheep. Moreover, Tibetan sheep had lower AMPK alpha mRNA expression but higher mammalian target of rapamycin mRNA expression in the adipocytes than Small-tailed Han sheep. We concluded that Tibetan sheep had lower catabolism but higher anabolism in adipose tissue and reduced the capacity for glucose and fatty acid uptake to a greater extent than Small-tailed Han sheep to maintain energy homoeostasis when in negative energy balance. These responses provide Tibetan sheep with a high ability to cope with low energy intake and with the harsh environment of the QTP.

Ecosystem respiration (ER) and soil respiration (SR) account for two of the largest terrestrial C fluxes to the atmosphere, and they play critical roles in regulating C-climate feedbacks. Here, the responses of ER, SR and their source components to experimental burning in a meadow grassland on the Tibetan Plateau were investigated. Fire treatment increased ER by 9% but decreased SR by 15%. The contrasting post-fire responses of SR and ER can be explained by the behaviour of their source components; that is, fire increased aboveground plant respiration (R-agb) by 37%, but decreased heterotrophic respiration (HR) by 21%. Increases in ER and R-agb were mainly related to enhanced plant productivity, whereas smaller SR and HR were associated with reductions in microbial biomass and soil moisture. Accounting for the responses of ER, SR and their intrinsic components has advanced our understanding of how fire affects ecosystem C fluxes.

Salt-tolerant halophytes are often used as a promising approach to remedy the saline soils. Yet, how rhizosphere microbes' association and functions vary with halophytes in saline ecosystems remains unclear, restricting our ability to assess the role of halophytes in remedying saline ecosystems. Herein, we examined bacterial and fungal diversities, compositions, and co-occurrence networks in the rhizospheres of six halophytes and bulk soils in a semiarid inland saline ecosystem, and related these parameters to microbial functions. The microbiomes were more diverse and complex and microbial activity and residues were higher in rhizospheres than bulk soils. The connections of taxa in the rhizosphere microbial communities increased with fungi-fungi and bacteria-fungi connections and fungal diversity. The proportion of the fungi-related central connections were larger in rhizospheres (13-73%) than bulk soils (3%). Moreover, microbial activity and residues were significantly correlated with microbial composition and co-occurrence network complexity. These results indicated that enhanced association between fungi and bacteria increased microbial co-occurring network complexity in halophytes rhizosphere, which contributed to the higher microbial functions (microbial activities and residue) in this inland saline ecosystem.					zhang, jiayue/JUF-0129-2023; Zhou, Hong/JKJ-1067-2023; Zhang, Qian/JPK-7486-2023; Hansong Zhu, 祝寒松/IAN-2892-2023; QIU, LI/JPK-7397-2023; Sadowsky, Michael/J-2507-2016	Zhang, Qian/0000-0002-1222-308X; Hansong Zhu, 祝寒松/0000-0001-6940-5565; Sadowsky, Michael/0000-0001-8779-2781													0048-9697	1879-1026				JUL 20	2022	831								154944	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154944	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154944								35367547					WOS:000892738200004

The interplays between the host and gut microbiota remain largely unclear, and few studies have investigated these interplays using integrative multi-omics data. In this study, large-scale multi-comic datasets, including microbiome, metabolome, bulk transcriptomics and single cell RNA sequencing of CRC patients, were analyzed individually and integrated through advanced bioinformatics methods. We further examined the clinical relevance of these findings in the mice recolonized with microbiota from human. We found that CRC patients had distinct microbiota compositions compared to healthy controls. A machine-learning model was developed with 28 biomarkers for detection of CRC, which had high accuracy and clinical applicability. We identified multiple significant correlations between genera and well-characterized genes, suggesting the potential role of gut microbiota in tumor immunity. Further analysis showed that specific metabolites worked as profound communicators between these genera and tumor immunity. Integrating microbiota and metabolome perspectives, we cataloged gut taxonomic and metabolomic features that represented the key multi-omics signature of CRC. Furthermore, gut microbiota transplanted from CRC patients compromised the response of CRC to immunotherapy. These phenotypes were strongly associated with the alterations in gut microbiota, immune cell infiltration as well as multiple metabolic pathways. The comprehensive interplays across multi-comic data of CRC might explain how gut microbiota influenced tumor immunity. Hence, we proposed that modifying the CRC microbiota using healthy donors might serve as a promising strategy to improve response to immunotherapy.

However, information about warming effects on the stability of carbon pools in soil aggregates is limited. Here, we implemented a 21-year long-term open-top-chamber (OTCs) warming experiment to reveal the warming effects on the stability of topsoil aggregate structure and carbon pools in a Tibetan alpine meadow and shrubland. The results demonstrated that long-term warming significantly reduced the soil aggregate stability of the shrubland, but had no significant effect on the alpine meadow. Although warming enhanced the stability of carbon pools in topsoil aggregate fractions for both the alpine meadow and shrubland, a negative response of the carbon management index (CMI) and carbon pool storage in the alpine meadow was found, while shrubland showed a positive response to warming. The response of carbon fractions to warming depended on soil aggregate size, with a reduction of labile C fraction 1 (C1) and stable carbon fraction (C4) in large (LMGA: >2 mm) and small macroaggregates (SMGA: 2-0.25 mm) of the alpine meadow, and unchanged carbon fractions in micro -aggregates (MIGA: <0.25 mm) for both the alpine meadow and shrubland. Long-term warming significantly decreased C-acquiring enzyme activity in shrubland, but had no significant effect on the meadow. Enzyme ac-tivity and glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) concentration decreased as the size of soil aggregates increased in the alpine meadow and shrubland, which could be attributed to the structural characteristics of microaggregates, which have larger specific surface area and stronger microbial protection ability. Our findings provide a new perspective in understanding the response of alpine meadow and shrubland soil structure and carbon pool sta-bility to long-term warming at the soil aggregate level.					xuan, li/JNI-7432-2023; Wang, Jiacheng/ABE-5948-2020; chen, wenjing/IZE-8536-2023; li, bai/JNE-1502-2023; li, xiang/JCN-9316-2023; Yang, Jing/JFK-4046-2023	Yang, Jing/0009-0004-8274-9863													0341-8162	1872-6887				MAR	2023	222								106848	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106848	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106848		DEC 2022											WOS:000905153600001

Human activities will alter the components of the atmosphere and lead to climate change, which consequently affects crop production badly. In this context, wheat is considered an important crop and ranks as one of the top strategic crops globally. The main objective of this research is to develop a new approach (a weighted climatic suitability index) for evaluating the climate suitability for wheat production. The specific objectives are to project the impact of future climate change on wheat suitability using three models based on WCSI and CMIP6-based projections and to identify the most vulnerable area to climate change and productivity reduction. The climatic criteria for wheat production were selected and classified into eight indicators based on the Sys' scheme and the FAO framework, and then the weighted overlay approach was used in conjunction with the analytic hierarchy process. To confirm the reliability of the integrated WCSI, we determined the nonlinear curve fitting of integrated WCSI-induced wheat yields by the exponential growth equation. Finally, the CMIP6-GCMs projected from three shared socioeconomic pathways were used for WCSI mapping and predicting wheat yields in the short and long term (Southern Syria was selected as a case study). The results show that the nonlinear correlation between wheat yields and the integrated WCSI was 0.78 (R-2 = 0.61) confirming the integrated WCSI's reliability in reflecting yield variation caused by climate suitability. The results indicated that WCSI for wheat will be lower over the study area during 2080-2100 compared to the current climate. During 2080-2100, the wheat yield is projected to decrease by 0.2-0.8 t. -ha(-1) in the western parts of the study area. The findings of this study could be used to plan and develop adaptation strategies for sustainable wheat production in the face of projected climate change. The results of the study will also help in the strategic planning of wheat production in Syria under the projected climate. The results of this research are limited to small areas as a case study, although they are not relevant to similar regions worldwide. However, the study employs novel analytical methods that can be used broadly.

However, recently, it was argued that carboxylate release may be a way to discharge surplus carbon produced under conditions that limit plant growth. Plant P status may not be the main factor driving carboxylate release by roots. Instead, plant nitrogen (N) status and/or N:P ratio of the soil or plant may play a more important role in enhancing carboxylate release. Methods A greenhouse pot experiment was performed to grow alfalfa in a P-deficient soil, supplied with two rates of P (0 and 20 mg kg(-1)) in combination with four forms of nitrogen (N) at five rates (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg kg(-1)), to explore the effects of P rate, N form, N rate, and their interactions on plant growth, P and N status, and carboxylate release, and to determine the factors driving carboxylate release. Results Nitrogen addition weakened the positive effect of P addition on plant growth, and increased plant N and P concentrations; P addition increased plant P concentration, but weakened the effect of N addition on plant N concentration. The amount of tartrate increased dramatically with increasing N rate, which decreased shoot growth, depending on N form. At high P supply, tartrate exudation correlated negatively with shoot biomass. Conclusions Nitrogen addition to P-deficient alfalfa decreased shoot growth and enhanced the release of tartrate, likely to discharge surplus carbon; and the effects varied with N form.

The field mulching could improve sustainability of spring maize production on the Loess Plateau	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Despite field mulching has been widely adopted to improve crop productivity, agro-ecosystem sustainability of this technology in arid and semi-arid areas is inconclusive. We examined the response of yield stability, changes in soil water storage (delta SWS), nitrogen (N) budget, soil total nitrogen (TN) content and soil organic carbon (SOC) content to furrow-ridge tillage and film or straw field mulching practices in a 6-year field experiment of rain-fed spring maize (Zea mays L.) on the Loess Plateau from 2016 to 2021. Five tillage practices included conventional tillage (CT), ridge tillage (RT), flat planting with plastic film mulching (FM), ridge tillage with plastic film mulching on ridge (RTF) and maize straw mulching (SM). Nitrogen application rates were 0 and 225 kg N ha(-1). Maize yield and yield sustainability index (SYI) of plastic film mulching increased by 26.8%- 73.4% and 4.4%13.9%, respectively, compared with CT, and coefficient of variation (CV) of plastic film mulching declined by 0.7%- 10.7% relative to that of CT. The average delta SWS of all tillage patterns were positive, and the rainwater use potential was 88.3-96.9%. The N budget in all practices was positive under N applied treatments but negative without N input. Without N application, N consumption was substantially exacerbated by plastic film mulching, whereas it was mitigated to some extent by SM. The TN and SOC contents were maintained under plastic film mulching. Soil TN and SOC contents in SM increased by 27.1-29.8% and 22.3-33.3%, respectively, in tested stage. However, its yield varied substantially, particularly under no N application. Small yield increase and higher CV and lower SYI occurred in RT practice. The SOC declined similar to CT. Overall, there was higher variation of yield in SM practice. The SOC appeared to decline in RT practice. The plastic film mulching was a promising practice to increase and stabilize maize yields, improve the rainfall use potential, increase or maintain the TN and SOC contents in semi-arid regions. However, attention should be paid to the impact of microplastic contamination in future research.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				APR 1	2023	279								108156	10.1016/j.agwat.2023.108156	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2023.108156		JAN 2023											WOS:000927999300001

Microplastics can threaten air quality, food and water health, as well as human health by wind erosion processes. In this research, we investigated MPs collected in four wind erosion events at sampling heights between 0 and 60 cm in typical semiarid farmlands in northern China that employ plastic film mulch. Height distribution and enrichment heights of the MPs were measured. The results revealed that the average amounts of MPs for 0-20 cm, 20-40 cm and 40-60 cm sampling heights were 868.71 +/- 249.21, 799.87 +/- 271.25, 1102.54 +/- 317.44 particles kg-1. The average enrichment ratios of MPs for the different heights were 0.89 +/- 0.54, 0.85 +/- 0.56, 1.15 +/- 0.73. Height distribution of MPs was combined affected by shape (fiber and non-fiber) and size of MPs, wind speed and soil aggregate stability. The amount of fibers approximately <4 mm in size and non-fibers <2 mm in size increased with sampling height, while both shapes of larger MPs than these two sizes was almost independent of the sampling height. Enrichment ratios of microfibers were positively related to wind speed but negatively related to soil aggregate stability at each sampling height. The results revealed that although MPs have similar density to organic matter (OM), the MPs' amount and enrichment were independent of height but the OM content and enrichment ratios increased with height. These results suggested that more attention should be paid to the exploration of the influence of higher sampling heights (>60 cm) on the distribution of MPs in the future and the MPs characteristics for different sampling heights require carefully parameterization in detailed models of atmospheric MPs transport by wind erosion.

Our 342-day leaf litter (Quercus wutaishanica) decomposition experiment at the Loess Plateau (China) sheds light on how soil microorganisms - mainly the soil microbial biomass C, N, P, and soil enzyme activities - maintain element homeostasis of C, N, and P by producing soil enzymes during various phases of litter decomposition. Overall, the highest soil enzyme activities were measured in summer, whereas soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and soil microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) were highest in winter. Soil water content and soil temperature had significant effects on soil enzyme activities and stoichiometry. The results indicate that the stoichiometry of extracellular enzyme activities (lnBG:lnNAG:lnAP) changes significantly between individual stages of litter decomposition. The resources available for microorganisms were restricted by C and P, while P limitation progressively decelerated during decomposition and C limitation was enhanced at the latest stage. Strong positive correlations between ecological indicators of microbial element limitation and soil enzyme activities indicated that microbes allocate C and nutrients towards soil enzyme production to mine for scarce nutrients. This adaptation strategy enabled the soil microorganisms to maintain element homeostasis. Soil MBC, MBN, soil microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP), MBC:MBN, MBC:MBP, and MBN:MBP rarely showed significant correlations with soil or leaf litter C, N, P, C:N, C:P, and N:P. This suggests no resource dependency of microbial element composition but supports the concept of element homeostasis of soil microorganisms. Besides compensating for element imbalances by adjusting soil enzyme production, the microorganisms also adjusted element use efficiencies such as C use efficiency. We conclude that the maintenance of element homeostasis by soil microorganisms induces a tight co-regulation of enzymes involved in covering their C and nutrient supply during successive litter degradation.

J	Wu, L; He, Y; Ma, XY				Wu, Lei; He, Yin; Ma, Xiaoyi			Using five long time series hydrometeorological data to calibrate a dynamic sediment delivery ratio algorithm for multi-scale sediment yield predictions	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The sediment delivery ratio (SDR) is a key link between slope erosion and river sediment transport but the accurate quantification of sediment yield in different catchments has been hampered by a lack of dynamic multi-scale information on SDR. A dynamic multi-scale SDR algorithm was innovatively applied in the modified sediment yield model to quantify the spatiotemporal evolutions of sediment delivery and inventory the relationships between sediment yield and different hydrometeorological and landscape factors in the loess hilly and gully catchment. Results indicate that (i) The sloping farmland (dry lands in hilly areas) in the upstream catchment of Ansai hydrological station was an important sediment source because its soil erosion grade was between intensive and extremely intensive. The high-risk regions of sediment yield were primarily concentrated in the sloping farmlands locating at both sides of the river banks. (ii) The large-scale soil conservation practices since the late 1990s have played a very significant role in sediment reduction. The annual sediment yield rate showed an overall decreasing trend from 1981 to 2015, particularly, it decreased dramatically from 11,844.08 t center dot km(-2) in 2005 to 65 t center dot km(-2) in 2015. (iii) The correlations between SDR and sediment yield rate, maximum peak flow, or runoff amount were all greater than that of rainfall parameters, indicating that there was no direct causal relationship between SDR and rainfall indicators in loessial ecological restoration watersheds. Results provide scientific insights needed to guide model modifications and sustainable soil conservation planning in the Loess Plateau.

There is some debate about whether the grassland desertification is related to climate or grazing. Here, we employed vegetation coverage normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and landscape indexes to investigate the grassland desertification conditions and its impacts. We also linked these indexes to changes in climate and grazing to explore the major drivers. Our results demonstrated that the grassland conditions were improved, and the desertification area (35.28.104 km(2)) was smaller than the restoration area (38.77.104 km(2)) from 2001 to 2015 across Northern Tibet through the statistical analysis of different desertified gradient areas. A decrease in landscape indexes (e.g., patch density (PD) and splitting index (SPLIT)) and increases in largest patch index (LPI) and contagion index (CONTAG) were observed across Northern Tibet. The aridity index and grazing significantly influenced the landscape pattern of the whole alpine grassland. In general, changes in climate factors had the positive effects on the vegetation coverage of alpine grassland, but mean annual temperature had insignificant influence in alpine meadow and desert steppe (P > 0.05). In addition, mean annual precipitation had the most significant effect in the desert steppe (93.28%), followed by alpine steppe (79.31%) and alpine meadow (38.25%). Therefore, our results highlighted that the conditions of the alpine grassland were improved and more stable, and landscape fragmentations were mainly influenced by the aridity index and grazing.

Making full use of the genetic resources of Sea-island cotton will facilitate genetic improvement of widely cultivated Upland cotton varieties. The chromosome segments substitution lines (CSSLs) provide an ideal strategy for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) in interspecific hybridization. Results In this study, a CSSL population was developed by PCR-based markers assisted selection (MAS), derived from the crossing and backcrossing ofGossypium hirsutum(Gh) andG. barbadense(Gb), firstly. Then, by whole genome re-sequencing, 11,653,661 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified which ultimately constructed 1211 recombination chromosome introgression segments from Gb. The sequencing-based physical map provided more accurate introgressions than the PCR-based markers. By exploiting CSSLs with mutant morphological traits, the genes responding for leaf shape and fuzz-less mutation in the Gb were identified. Based on a high-resolution recombination bin map to uncover genetic loci determining the phenotypic variance between Gh and Gb, 64 QTLs were identified for 14 agronomic traits with an interval length of 158 kb to 27 Mb. Surprisingly, multiple alleles of Gb showed extremely high value in enhancing cottonseed oil content (SOC). Conclusions This study provides guidance for studying interspecific inheritance, especially breeding researchers, for future studies using the traditional PCR-based molecular markers and high-throughput re-sequencing technology in the study of CSSLs. Available resources include candidate position for controlling cotton quality and quantitative traits, and excellent breeding materials. Collectively, our results provide insights into the genetic effects of Gb alleles on the Gh, and provide guidance for the utilization of Gb alleles in interspecific breeding.																			1471-2164					JUN 26	2020	21	1							431	10.1186/s12864-020-06800-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-020-06800-x								32586283					WOS:000545712500001

However, the variation and factors influencing gene-encoding enzymes for plant- and microbial-derived carbon decomposition in alpine steppes and alpine meadows remain unclear. Here, the trends in microbial carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) and their responses to the decomposition of biomass of different origins were studied using metagenomics in the alpine steppes and alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau. Our results revealed the abundance of GTs and CBMs was higher in the alpine steppes than in the alpine meadows, whereas AAs were higher in the alpine steppes than in the alpine meadows. Soil properties (i.e., soil water content, soil ammonium nitrogen, and nitrate nitrogen) highly related to CAZyme genes (GTs, CBMs, and AAs) showed an abundant pattern between the alpine steppes and alpine meadows. Moreover, our results indicated that the relative abundance of genes encoding CAZymes involved in the decomposition of plant- (indicated by cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) and fungal-derived carbon (indicated by chitin and glucans) was higher by 8.7% and 10.1%, respectively, in the alpine steppes than in the alpine meadows, whereas bacterial-derived carbon (indicated by peptidoglycan) was lower by 7.9% in the alpine steppes than in the alpine meadows. Soil water content (SWC), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-), and pH influenced on the abundance of CAZyme genes involved in the decomposition of plant-, fungal-, bacterial-derived carbon. In addition, the dominant microbial phyla (Actinobacteria, Protebacteria, and Acidobacteria) mineralized carbon sources from plant- and microbial-derived carbon through their corresponding CAZyme families. In conclusion, our study compared plant- and microbial-derived carbon decomposition potentials and influencing factors to illustrate the contribution of dead biomass to carbon accumulation in alpine grasslands.

However, it remains largely unclear about the effect of extreme weather events (extreme drought, heavy rainfall, extreme heat, and extreme cold) on terrestrial C and N cycling. This study aims to analyze the responses of pools and fluxes of C and N in plants, soil, and microbes to extreme weather events by conducting a global meta-analysis of 656 pairwise observations. Results showed that extreme weather events (extreme drought, heavy rainfall, and extreme heat) decreased plant biomass and C flux, and extreme drought and heavy rainfall decreased the plant N pool and soil N flux. These results suggest that extreme weather events weaken the C and N cycling process in terrestrial ecosystems. However, this study did not determine the impact of extreme cold on ecosystem C and N cycling. Additional field experiments are needed to reveal the effects of extreme cold on global C and N cycling patterns.																			0269-7491	1873-6424				FEB 15	2023	319								120996	10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120996	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120996		JAN 2023						36608729					WOS:000938114800001

Appropriately assessing the impacts of climate change on crop productivity and understanding the adaptation potential of agriculture to climate change are urgently needed to help develop effective strategies for future agriculture and to maintain food security. In this study, we studied future maize yield changes under 1.5 degrees C (2018-2037) and 2 degrees C (2044-2063) warming scenarios and investigated the adaptation potential across China's Maize Belt by optimizing the sowing date and cultivar using the APSIM-Maize model. In comparison to the baseline scenario, under the 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C warming scenarios, we found that without adaptation, maize yields would increase in the relatively cool regions with a single-cropping system but decrease in other regions. However, in comparison with the baseline scenario, under the 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C warming scenarios with adaptation, maize yields would increase by 11.1%-53.9% across the study area. Across the maize belt, compared with the baseline scenario, under warming of 1.5 degrees C, the potential sowing window would increase by 2-17 d, and under warming of 2 degrees C, this sowing window would increase by 4-26 d. The optimal sowing window would also be significantly extended in the regions with single-cropping systems by an average of 10 d under the 1.5 degrees C warming scenario and 12 d under the 2 degrees C warming scenario. Late-maturing cultivar achieved higher yield than early-middle maturing cultivars in all regions except the north part of Northeast China. Adjusting the sowing date by increasing growth-period precipitation contributed more (44.5%-96.7%) to yield improvements than shifting cultivars (0%-50.8%) and climate change (-53.1% to 23.0%) across all maize planting regions except in the wet southwestern parts of the maize belt. The differences among the maize planting regions in terms of high adaptation potential provide invaluable information for policymakers and stakeholders of maize production to set out optimized agricultural strategies to safeguard the supply of maize.

Temperatures lower than 12 degrees C are generally detrimental for the germination of peanuts. To date, there has been no report on precise information on the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for cold tolerance during the germination in peanuts. In this study, we developed a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population comprising 807 RILs by tolerant and sensitive parents. Phenotypic frequencies of germination rate low-temperature conditions among RIL population showed normally distributed in five environments. Then, we constructed a high density SNP-based genetic linkage map through whole genome re-sequencing (WGRS) technique and identified a major quantitative trait locus (QTL), qRGRB09, on chromosome B09. The cold tolerance-related QTLs were repeatedly detected in all five environments, and the genetic distance was 6.01 cM (46.74 cM - 61.75 cM) after taking a union set. To further confirm that qRGRB09 was located on chromosome B09, we developed Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) markers for the corresponding QTL regions. A regional QTL mapping analysis, which was conducted after taking the intersection of QTL intervals of all environments into account, confirmed that qRGRB09 was between the KASP markers, G22096 and G220967 (chrB09:155637831-155854093), and this region was 216.26 kb in size, wherein a total of 15 annotated genes were detected. This study illustrates the relevance of WGRS-based genetic maps for QTL mapping and KASP genotyping that facilitated QTL fine mapping of peanuts. The results of our study also provided useful information on the genetic architecture underlying cold tolerance during germination in peanuts, which in turn may be useful for those engaged in molecular studies as well as crop improvement in the cold-stressed environment.					liu, xiao/JLL-2119-2023; zhao, lin/JPK-8436-2023; WANG, YING/JLM-9219-2023; Yang, Min/JPY-3791-2023; zhao, weiwei/JUU-6585-2023; Yang, Fan/JMA-9594-2023; chen, yanhong/JVE-0289-2024; Yang, Ying/JLL-3724-2023; Wang, lili/IXD-9828-2023; yang, xiao/JLL-7721-2023; Zhou, heng/JCN-6493-2023; Li, Wei/JLL-4365-2023; Chen, Yu/JLL-0171-2023														1664-462X					MAY 8	2023	14								1153293	10.3389/fpls.2023.1153293	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2023.1153293								37223785					WOS:000990287500001

M.; Feng, Hao; Wang, Naijiang			Ammoniated straw incorporation increases maize grain yield while decreasing net greenhouse gas budget on the Loess Plateau, China	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Two major concerns of sustainable agriculture are safeguarding food security and attenuating climate warming. Straw incorporation is a widely used field management measure, but issues are associated with its high carbon: nitrogen (C:N) ratio. Ammoniated straw treatments aim to reduce straw C:N ratio; however, studies on the performances of long-term ammoniated straw incorporation on maize grain yield and net greenhouse gas (GHG) budget are still scarce. We conducted a long-term in situ trial (2012-2021) to estimate the performance of different straw utilization methods (CK, straw removal; CSI, conventional straw incorporation; ASI, ammoniated straw incorporation) on grain yield, GHG emissions, net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB), net greenhouse gas budget (NGB), and net greenhouse gas intensity (NGHGI) in maize fields. Grain yield was 8.3% and 24.7% greater with ASI than that with CSI and CK, respectively. And ASI had the lowest coefficient of variation for grain yield and the highest sustainable yield index. However, in comparison with CK, both straw incorporation methods significantly aggravated CO2 and N2O emissions, on average, by 101.0% and 107.5% (CSI) and 59.4% and 80.8% (ASI), respectively. The CK, CSI, and ASI obtained average NECB values of 38, 841, and 1556 kg C ha(-1), respectively. The amount of C in soil heterotrophic respiration, roots, extra-root material, and straw input significantly affected NECB. NGB and NGHGI were ranked ASI < CSI < CK, which was attributed primarily to significant changes in NECB, followed by N2O emissions. These results suggested that ASI can enhance maize yield and yield stability and reduce net GHG budget on the Loess Plateau.

However, the scheme has failed to consider farmers' potential willingness to pay (WTP) for SLM practices, as well as basic biophysical, socioeconomic, and institutional factors. This study estimated farmers' potential WTP (in terms of labor) and analyzed the drivers behind it in the Upper Blue Nile basin in Ethiopia. A contingent valuation method and Tobit econometric model were used to analyze survey data from 300 household heads. About 76% of the farmers said they would be willing to contribute labor (3.5-28 man-days yr(-1)), but the mean WTP (9.4 man-days yr(-1)) of the three watersheds was less than the set government value (28 man-days yr(-1)). The farmers' WTP aggregate benefit at the watershed scale was estimated to be US$55,572 yr(-1). The econometric model results revealed that sex, age group, farmland size, SLM-related training, and household perception of land degradation influenced farmers' potential WTP. To this end, revising the current CBWD scheme by considering various aspects of farmers' WTP would help to make the scheme demand-driven. Moreover, the provision of gender- and resource-disaggregated training and the introduction of economic incentives to increase the economic productivity of SLM practices would enhance farmers' maximum WTP capacity and assure sustainable community participation.

Genome-Wide Detection of SNP Markers Associated with Four Physiological Traits in Groundnut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i> L.) Mini Core Collection	AGRONOMY-BASEL												In order to integrate genomics in breeding and development of drought-tolerant groundnut genotypes, identification of genomic regions/genetic markers for drought surrogate traits is essential. We used 3249 diversity array technology sequencing (DArTSeq) markers for a genetic analysis of 125 ICRISAT groundnut mini core collection evaluated in 2015 and 2017 for genome-wide marker-trait association for some physiological traits and to determine the magnitude of linkage disequilibrium (LD). Marker-trait association (MTA) analysis, probability values, and percent variation modelled by the markers were calculated using the GAPIT package via the KDCompute interface. The LD analysis showed that about 36% of loci pairs were in significant LD (p < 0.05 and r(2) > 0.2) and 3.14% of the pairs were in complete LD. The MTAs studies revealed 20 significant MTAs (p < 0.001) with 11 markers. Four MTAs were identified for leaf area index, 13 for canopy temperature, one for chlorophyll content and two for normalized difference vegetation index. The markers explained 20.8% to 6.6% of the phenotypic variation observed. Most of the MTAs identified on the A subgenome were also identified on the respective homeologous chromosome on the B subgenome. This could be due to a common ancestor of the A and B genome which explains the linkage detected between markers lying on different chromosomes. The markers identified in this study can serve as useful genomic resources to initiate marker-assisted selection and trait introgression of groundnut for drought tolerance after further validation.

This paper examines the covariates that shape rural livelihood diversification and examines their effects on the intensity of adoption of SLM practices. Household-level data were collected in 2017 from 270 households in three drought-prone watersheds located in northwestern Ethiopia. We used the Herfindahl-Simpson diversity index to explore the extent of livelihood diversification. A stochastic dominance ordering was also employed to identify remunerative livelihood activities. A multivariate probit model was employed to estimate the probability of choosing simultaneous livelihood strategies, and an ordered probit model was estimated to examine the effect of livelihood diversification on the adoption intensity of SLM practices. In addition to mixed cropping and livestock production, the production of emerging cash crops (e.g., Acacia decurrens for charcoal, and khat) dominated the overall income generation of the majority of farmers. Stress/shock experience, extent of agricultural intensification, and agro-ecology significantly affected the probability of choosing certain livelihood strategies. Livelihood diversification at the household level was significantly associated with the dependency ratio, market distance, credit access, extension services, membership in community organizations, level of income, and livestock ownership. A greater extent of livelihood diversification had a significant negative effect on adopting a greater number of SLM practices, whereas it had a positive effect on lower SLM adoption intensity. Overall, we found evidence that having greater livelihood diversification could prompt households not to adopt more SLM practices. Livelihood initiatives that focus on increasing shock resilience, access to financial support mechanisms, improving livestock production, and providing quality extension services, while also considering agro-ecological differences, are needed. In addition, development planners should take into account the livelihood portfolios of rural households when trying to implement SLM policies and programs.					nigussie, zerihun/AAV-9190-2020; Tsunekawa, Atsushi/L-8526-2013; Ketema, Dessalegn Molla/AAL-4589-2021; Nigussie, Zerihun/AAA-5865-2021; Abeje, Misganaw/AAA-4130-2020; Abeje, Misganaw/AAH-7923-2019; Haregeweyn, Nigussie/J-5616-2015; Elias, Asres/D-4847-2019	nigussie, zerihun/0000-0002-8001-2073; Tsunekawa, Atsushi/0000-0002-7690-0633; Nigussie, Zerihun/0000-0002-8001-2073; Abeje, Misganaw/0000-0001-6271-6459; Haregeweyn, Nigussie/0000-0003-2920-8094; Adgo, Enyew/0000-0001-6824-5037														2071-1050				MAY 2	2019	11	10							2991	10.3390/su11102991	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11102991													WOS:000471010300274

In this study, we carry out a quantitative and comprehensive analysis to identify dynamic processes and mechanisms of soil erosion, fluvial plain deposition, and river delta formation in response to Holocene envi-ronmental changes over the past 10,000 years. In this investigation, the following results are achieved. First, spatial variations of the monsoon border (400 mm isohyet) resulted in dynamic changes in soil erosion on the Loess Plateau, sediment transportation downstream, and fluvial deposition on the plains and delta during the Holocene. Climate change and human activities played essential roles in variations of the plateau-plain-delta system during different periods. In the early Holocene, the number and scale of Neolithic cultural sites in the Yellow River basin increased. In the past 3000 years, human activities have strongly influenced and dominated environmental evolution in this region. Second, soil erosion was the critical contributor to the construction of the North China Plain. The Yellow River Delta provided the preliminary living environment where historical civi-lization in the Yellow River basin formed and developed, giving birth to the Yellow River civilization. Sediment discharge in the Loess Plateau was the primary source for river channel development and shaping of the river delta.					Delang, Claudio O.

This study aimed to detect the variability of carbon productivity using the standardized evapotranspiration deficit index (SEDI). Sixteen countries in the Middle East (ME) were selected to investigate drought. To this end, the yearly GPP dataset for the study area, spanning the 35 years (1982-2017) was used. Additionally, the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM, version 3.3a), which estimates the various components of terrestrial evapotranspiration (annual actual and potential evaporation), was used for the same period. The main findings indicated that productivity in croplands and grasslands was more sensitive to the SEDI in Syria, Iraq, and Turkey by 34%, 30.5%, and 29.6% of cropland area respectively, and 25%, 31.5%, and 30.5% of grass land area. A significant positive correlation against the long-term data of the SEDI was recorded. Notably, the GPP recorded a decline of >60% during the 2008 extreme drought in the north of Iraq and the northeast of Syria, which concentrated within the agrarian ecosystem and reached a total vegetation deficit with 100% negative anomalies. The reductions of the annual GPP and anomalies from 2009 to 2012 might have resulted from the decrease in the annual SEDI at the peak 2008 extreme drought event. Ultimately, this led to a long delay in restoring the ecosystem in terms of its vegetation cover. Thus, the proposed study reported that the SEDI is more capable of capturing the GPP variability and closely linked to drought than commonly used indices. Therefore, understanding the response of ecosystem productivity to drought can facilitate the simulation of ecosystem changes under climate change projections.

However, hyporheic water exchange is poorly understood because of the complicated river morphology within a river confluence. Therefore, the river confluence between the Juehe River and Haohe River located in arid and semi-arid areas of northwestern China was selected to evaluate the hyporheic water exchange processes, and the temperatures of different depth sediment were measured on July 11th and 12th, 2016 by an instrument equipped with five temperature sensors. The patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange were estimated using a one-dimensional heat transport model coupled with temperature data. Meanwhile, terrain points elevations and sediment particle distributions in this river confluence were collected to determine the confluence riverbed morphology. Furthermore, the river confluence morphology effects on hyporheic water exchange were investigated in this study. The different riverbed morphology and hydrodynamic zone locations were observed, which were controlled by the planform geometry with low river confluence flux momentum during the test period. Meanwhile, the upwelling flow dominated in the test area, and the downwelling occurred at three of the 23 total test points, which was induced by the complicated riverbed morphology and hydraulic characteristics. Additionally, the magnitudes of the upwelling flow were significantly influenced by the sediment heterogeneity subjected to the erosional and depositional processes. Hyporheic water exchange is a vital hydrological process in arid and semi-arid areas, where it significantly impacts the ecological environment of rivers. This study provides a valuable guideline for water quality and quantity management in arid and semi-arid areas.

However, revegetation in water-limited regions will inevitably reduce the water available for socio-economic systems, which is poorly considered in decision-making on sustainable ecosystem management. This paper proposed a framework to determine the threshold of vegetation productivity (i.e., ecosystem carrying capacity), corresponding to available water resources for ecosystems (i.e., annual precipitation minus water demand for socioeconomic systems) on the Loess Plateau. The average annual ecosystem carrying capacity (ECC) during 1982-2012 is 577 +/- 124 g Cm-2 yr(-1), with spatial gradients increasing from northwest to southeast. Vegetation in rocky mountain areas has the largest value of 833 +/- 200 g Cm-2 yr(-1). Factorial analysis suggests that changes in precipitation and human water use contributed to 55% and 45% of the multi-decadal changes in regional ECC, respectively. Meanwhile, due to revegetation, 26 counties on the Loess Plateau, mainly in the southeast and eastern parts, have exceeded the ECC threshold during the study period. An additional 138 counties have a high potential for water competition between the ecosystems and socio-economic systems. At the regional scale, there are 9 years (similar to 30% of the study period) during which the ECC threshold has been exceeded, especially after 1997. Considering the climate change in the future and the growing demand for water in socioeconomic systems, the corresponding ECC threshold will increase by 6-36%. We believe that these findings can provide reference for policy-makers to make decisions towards ecosystem sustainability while meeting human needs for water resources.

In efforts to restore degraded lands, fencing enclosure has been used extensively. However, the effect of fencing on N allocation patterns and nutritional strategy of alpine plants are equivocal. In this study, we used N-15 tracer (CO ((NH2)-N-15)(2), 10 g N m(-2)) to examine the allocation and distribution of N in plants and soil in grasslands either grazed heavily by livestock or fenced for three years in an alpine meadow of Northern Tibet. The N-15 recovery (N-15(rec)) in shoots of the fenced enclosure increased by 207% in grasses, decreased by 103% in forbs, and did not change in sedges when compared to the grazed meadow. The N-15(rec) in shoots accounted for only 1.97% and 4.65% of the total N in the grazed and fenced meadows, respectively. Fencing increased soil N-15 content at 0-5 cm depth by 6.9%, but decreased the content at 5-10 cm depth by 11.7%. The results demonstrated that fencing altered the soil N distribution by increasing N-15 rec in top soil and by decreasing N-15(rec) in subsurface soil. In addition, fencing had no impact on root N-15 storage (33%-39%), N-15 losses (9.6%-12.5%) and soil available N-15(rec) (NH4+ -N, NO3--N and light fraction organic N), but decreased root:shoot N-15(rec) ratio by 49.8% (16.9:1 in grazed and 8.4:1 in fenced grassland). Fencing increased soil organic carbon, total N and NO3--N concentrations, which indicated that the strategy of the plants was to allocate relatively more N to roots in nutrient-poor soil (grazed) but relatively more N to shoots in nutrient-rich soil (fenced).

The liver produces and mediates heat production in mammals; however, to date, little is known about the role of liver genes in cold-induced thermogenesis in lambs. In this study, the difference in the liver transcriptome between Altay and Hu ewe lambs was compared. Because of different backgrounds of the two breeds, we hypothesized that the transcriptome profiles of the liver would differ between breeds when exposed to cold. Cold-exposed Altay lambs activated 8 candidate genes (ACTA1, MYH1, MYH2, MYL1, MYL2, TNNC1, TNNC2, and TNNT3) involved in muscle shivering thermogenesis; 3 candidate genes (ATP2A1, SLN, and CKM) involved in muscle nonshivering thermogenesis related to the Ca2+ signal and creatine cycle; and 6 candidate genes (PFKM, ALDOC, PGAM2, ENO2, ENO3, and ENO4) involved in enhancing liver metabolism. In contrast, the liver may not act as the main tissue for thermogenesis in cold-exposed Hu lambs. We concluded that Altay lambs rely on liver-mediated shivering and nonshivering thermogenesis by muscle tissue to a greater extent than Hu lambs. Results from this study could provide a theoretical foundation for the breeding and production of cold-resistant lambs.																			0016-6723	1469-5073				AUG 11	2021	2021								5510297	10.1155/2021/5510297	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/5510297								36017327					WOS:000687446900001

The competitive advantage of a constitutive CAM species over a C<sub>4</sub> grass species under drought and CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment	ECOSPHERE												Plants with crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) are increasing in distribution and abundance in drylands worldwide, but the underlying drivers remain unknown. We investigate the impacts of extreme drought and CO2 enrichment on the competitive relationships between seedlings of Cylindropuntia imbricata (CAM species) and Bouteloua eriopoda (C-4 grass), which coexist in semiarid ecosystems across the Southwestern United States. Our experiments under altered water and CO2 water conditions show that C. imbricata positively responded to CO2 enrichment under extreme drought conditions, while B. eriopoda declined from drought stress and did not recover after the drought ended. Conversely, in well-watered conditions B. eriopoda had a strong competitive advantage on C. imbricata such that the photosynthetic rate and biomass (per individual) of C. imbricata grown with B. eriopoda were lower relative to when growing alone. A meta-analysis examining multiple plant families across global drylands shows a positive response of CAM photosynthesis and productivity to CO2 enrichment. Collectively, our results suggest that under drought and elevated CO2 concentrations, projected with climate change, the competitive advantage of plant functional groups may shift and the dominance of CAM plants may increase in semiarid ecosystems.

We investigated the impacts of climate change on maize yield across China's Maize Belt (23 degrees-48 degrees N) using the CERES-Maize model driven by future climate scenarios under contrasting maize growing season temperatures of 18-24 degrees C during the 2050s (2040-2069) and the 2080s (2070-2099). We also assessed the potential of different cultivars to adapt to rising temperatures and heat stress with an extreme hot global climate model from CMIP6 under a high emission scenario (SSP585). Our simulated results indicated that the shortened growth period resulting from rising temperatures, decreased photosynthesis caused by heat stress, and decreased grain-filling rate due to heat stress were the main reasons causing future maize (Zea mays L.) yield decreases in all subregions of China's Maize Belt. The priority applied to using a cultivar with a longer growth period or higher heattolerance to cope with climate warming depends on the particulars of the local climate and cropping system. Specifically, the potential for adapting to rising temperature is generally higher than the potential for adapting to heat stress in all subregions except the North China Plain (NCP) where the potential for adapting to heat stress is higher than the potential for adapting to rising temperature. Our study demonstrated the necessity of using cultivars with appropriate traits to alleviate the adverse effects of climate warming. Also, our findings provide important information for the direction and priority of future breeding in different climate regions with various cropping systems across China's Maize Belt.

Its belowground carbon turnover process is sensitive to land use changes and has a huge impact on atmospheric CO2 contents. However, the interpretation of the vertical distribution of delta C-13 values of soil organic carbon (SOC-delta C-13), the SOC turnover rate (beta value) and their changes in the soil profile remain uncertain after fencing (grazing exclusion). Grasslands that have been fenced for 39 years and grazed (as the control) on the Loess Plateau, China were selected to evaluate the vertical distribution of SOC-delta C-13 and beta values and their influencing factors across the 0-100 cm soil profile (0-10, 10-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, 80-100 cm). The results showed that SOC gradually decreased but SOC-delta C-13 overall increased with soil depths. Fencing significantly decreased the SOC-delta C-13 in 10-80 cm depth. The SOC delta C-13 had a positive correlation with delta C-13 values of microbial biomass carbon (MBC-delta C-13), but negative correlations with root biomass. Besides, the beta values of 0-60 cm depth were higher in fencing grasslands (-2.70) than that in grazing grasslands (-11.38). Overall, carbon input, microbial fractionation and soil leaching contributed to the increasing trend of SOC-delta C-13 with soil depths, and fencing increased the SOC content in the profile but decreased the SOC turnover rate in 0-60 cm soils. The results provide direct evidence for the change of SOC-delta C-13 and a more comprehensive understanding of SOC-delta C-13 and SOC turnover dynamics with long-term fencing across the soil profile. The information on SOC dynamics and their feedback to long-term fencing can aid in developing reasonable grassland management measures.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014	Li, Jiwei/0000-0003-3912-4564; Wu, Jianzhao/0000-0003-3124-1109													0167-8809	1873-2305				NOV 1	2022	339								108119	10.1016/j.agee.2022.108119	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2022.108119		AUG 2022											WOS:000869180700003

This study investigated the effects of e[CO2] on stomatal morphology and distribution, gas exchange and growth parameters of oilseed rape plants under water deficit [soil moisture decreased from 80% field capacity (FC) (W; full irrigation) to 60% FC (D1), 40% FC (D2), and < 35% FC (D3)] and re-watering conditions in growth chambers with [CO2] controlled at 400 mu mol mol-1 (a[CO2]) or 800 mu mol mol-1 (e[CO2]). e[CO2] had a strong CO2 fertilization effect on the net photo-synthetic rate (An) and growth of plants under water deficit. Under a[CO2], stomatal density and aperture on the adaxial leaf surface increased when soil moisture decreased from W to D1, while the stomatal aperture and regularity of the spatial distribution pattern of stomata decreased with decreasing soil moisture. Stomatal conductance (gs) were 47.1% and 26.1% capacity of anatomically determined maximum anatomical conductance (gsmax) with W under a[CO2] and e[CO2], respectively. e[CO2] enhanced plant recovery after re-watering through modifying stomatal traits. This study offers insights into the trade-off between stomatal traits and gas exchange for adapting plants to future climates.

However, the impacts of increased atmospheric N depositions on soil CH4 flux in tropical rainforests are still poorly understood. From January 2015 to December 2018, a field experiment was conducted in a primary tropical montane rainforest (PTMR) and a secondary tropical montane rainforest (STMR) in southern China to quantify the impact of N additions at four levels (N0: 0 kg N center dot ha-1 center dot year-1; N25: 25 kg N center dot ha-1 center dot year-1; N50: 50 kg N center dot ha-1 center dot year-1; N100: 100 kg N center dot ha-1 center dot year-1) on soil CH4 flux. Results: Four years of measurements showed clear seasonal variations in CH4 flux in all treatment plots for both forest types (PTMR and STMR), with lower rates of soil CH4 uptake during the wet season and higher rates of soil CH4 uptake during the dry season. Soil CH4 uptake rates were significantly and negatively correlated with both soil temperature and soil moisture for both forest types. Annual CH4 uptake for the N0 plots from the PTMR and STMR soils were -2.20 and -1.98 kg N center dot ha-1 center dot year-1, respectively. At the PTMR site, mean CH4 uptake compared with the N0 treatment was reduced by 19%, 29%, and 36% for the N25, N50, and N100 treatments, respectively. At the STMR site, mean CH4 uptake compared with the N0 treatment was reduced by 15%, 18%, and 38% for the N25, N50, and N100 treatments, respectively. High level N addition had a stronger inhibitory impact on soil CH4 uptake than did the low level N addition. Conclusion: Our data suggest that soil CH4 uptake in tropical rainforests is sensitive to N deposition. If atmospheric N deposition continues to increase in the future, the soil CH4 sink strength of tropical rainforests may weaken further.

However, irrigation effects have not been well addressed in the application of crop models at a regional scale due to limited availability, which constrains the reliability and accuracy of simulation results. Assimilating remote sensing information into crop models can provide a viable approach to reduce associated uncertainties. In this study, regional irrigation data for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown on the Loess Plateau was used to calibrate and validate the ChinaAgrosys (China Agricultural System) crop model at site and regional scales. Remote sensing data was then assimilated into the ChinaAgrosys crop model under four assimilation schemes. remotely sensed assimilation state variables (i.e., LAI and NDVI) and two assimilation algorithms (i.e., (Partical swarm optimization) and SCE-UA (Shuffled complex evolution)) were considered. During the winter wheat growing season on the Loess Plateau, 30.6% of the wheat production area was irrigated once, 6.7% irrigated two times, 3.7% was irrigated three times, and the remaining wheat area was rainfed. The R2 values between maturity date, LAI, and yield simulated by the ChinaAgrosys crop model and observations agrometeorological stations on the Loess Plateau were greater than 0.73, 0.44, and 0.60, respectively, during 2010-2015. The accuracy and spatial heterogeneity of winter wheat yield estimation were effectively improved by assimilating remote sensing data into the ChinaAgrosys crop model based on regional irrigation data. the four assimilation schemes, the combination of PSO+NDVI produced the highest accuracy for yield estimation in Hongtong county (92.8%), followed by SCE-UA+NDVI (92.0%). Our results demonstrated the importance accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of water availability when applying a crop model in arid and semi-arid regions. Additionally, our analysis regarding different assimilation state variables and algorithms indicated both simulation accuracy and calculation efficiency should be considered when assimilating remote sensing					TAO, BO/I-4166-2014; Wang, He/JCO-3900-2023; He, Liang/JDM-6141-2023														0378-3774	1873-2283				MAY 31	2022	266								107583	10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107583	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107583		MAR 2022											WOS:000793224400003

The Hargreaves model (HG) is currently recognized as the simplest and most effective ET0 estimation model. To further improve the prediction accuracy of the HG model, this study is based on the data of 98 meteorological stations in southwest China (1961-2019), using artificial bee colony (ABC), differential evolution (DE) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms to calibrate the HG model globally. The standard ET0 value was calculated by FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (PM) model. We compare the calculation accuracy of 3 calibrated HG models and 4 empirical models commonly used (Hargreaves, Priestley-Taylor, Imark-Allen and Jensen-Hais). The main outcomes demonstrated that on a daily scale, the calibrated HG models (R-2 range 0.74-0.98) are more accurate than 4 empirical models (R-2 range 0.55-0.84), and ET0-PSO-HG has the best accuracy, followed by ET0-ABC-HG and ET0-DE-HG, with average R-2 of 0.83, 0.82 and 0.80, average RRMSE of 0.23 mm/d, 0.25 mm/d and 0.26 mm/d, average MAE of 0.52 mm/d, 0.53 mm/d and 0.57 mm/d, and average GPI of 0.17, 0.05, and 0.04, respectively; on a monthly scale, ET0-PSO-HG also has the highest accuracy, followed by ET0-ABC-HG and ET0-DE-HG, with median R-2 of 0.96, 0.95 and 0.94, median RRMSE of 0.16 mm/d, 0.17 mm/d and 0.18 mm/d respectively, median MAE of 0.46 mm/d, 0.50 mm/d, and 0.55 mm/d, median GPI of 1.12, 0.44 and 0.34, respectively. The calibrated HG models (relative error of less than 10.31%) are also better than the four empirical models (relative error greater than 16.60%). Overall, the PSO-HG model has the most accurate ET0 estimation on daily and monthly scales, and it can be suggested as the preferred model to predict ET0 in humid regions in southwest China regions.

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of 142 studies and evaluated 986 observations comparisons of different carbon source responses to warming. Our results revealed several key insights. Firstly, climate warming resulted in an average increase of 5.46 % in the terrestrial soil carbon pool. Specifically, microbial-derived carbon showed an average increase of 6.32 %, while plant-derived carbon exhibited an average increase of 3.70 %. Secondly, while warming duration and magnitude do not significantly affect the response of microbial-derived carbon to warming, they did impact the response of plant-derived carbon. Lastly, we observed that the response of different carbon sources to warming was affected by the specific environmental backgrounds:ecosystem and climatic zone types affect the response of warming to microbial derived carbon, while differences in climatic region affect response of warming to plant-derived carbon. The variations in the response of different soil carbon sources to warming can be attributed to the nature of the carbon source themselves, as well as the complex transformations that occur between them through microbial metabolic processes and their interactions with soil mineral particles. We suggest that interactions at the soil plant-microbe interface should be considered more carefully, and the response of ecosystems to warming should be observed from the perspective of soil organic carbon sources, so as to better understand the response of terrestrial ecosystems carbon cycle to global warming.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				DEC 20	2023	905								166977	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166977	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166977		SEP 2023						37716687					WOS:001083149800001

Although field observations have demonstrated the strong spatial heterogeneity of Q10, a significant knowledge gap still exists regarding to the factors driving spatial and temporal variabilities of Q10 at regional scales. Therefore, we used a machine learning approach to predict Q10 from 1994 to 2016 with a spatial resolution of 1 km across China from 515 field observations at 5 cm soil depth using climate, soil and vegetation variables. Predicted Q10 varied from 1.54 to 4.17, with an area-weighted average of 2.52. There was no significant temporal trend for Q10 (p = 0.32), but annual vegetation production (indicated by normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) was positively correlated to it (p < 0.01). Spatially, soil organic car-bon (SOC) was the most important driving factor in 62 % of the land area across China, and varied greatly, demonstrat-ing soil controls on the spatial pattern of Q10. These findings highlighted different environmental controls on the spatial and temporal pattern of soil respiration Q10, which should be considered to improve global biogeochemical models used to predict the spatial and temporal patterns of soil carbon fluxes to ongoing climate change.

In this study, a vegetation correction coefficient was innovatively embedded in a dynamic particulate nutrient loss model to evaluate the monthly trends of particulate N and P loss in a small highly erodible watershed. Results indicate that (i) the monthly sediment yield from June to August 2013 accounted for the dominant percentage in this extreme hydrological year, which was consistent with the monthly trends of rainfall erosivity. The largest monthly sediment yield rate under four different vegetation scenarios all occurred in July with the values of 530.56, 258.09, 579.69, and 370.74 t km(-2). (ii) Particulate N and P loss from April to September changed significantly under different vegetation scenarios, and they were mainly concentrated in June and July 2013; only the N and P loss loads in July accounted for > 70% of annual load. However, the loads in January, February, March, October, November, and December were considered as zero because there was no erosive rainfall during the above 6 months. (iii) The reduction efficiency of particulate N and P loss by scenario 1 was about 1.7 times higher than scenario 3, which shows that forestland in sediment reduction was stronger than grassland and cropland in Zhifanggou Watershed. Results provide the underlying insights needed to guide vegetation reconstruction and soil conservation planning in loess hilly regions.

However, it is unclear how ensemble configurations (model composition and size) influence crop yield projections and uncertainty. Here, we investigate the influences of ensemble configurations on crop yield projections and modeling uncertainty from Global Gridded Crop Models and Global Climate Models under future climate change. We performed a cluster analysis to identify distinct groups of ensemble members based on their projected outcomes, revealing unique patterns in crop yield projections and corresponding uncertainty levels, particularly for wheat and soybean. Furthermore, our findings suggest that approximately six Global Gridded Crop Models and 10 Global Climate Models are sufficient to capture modeling uncertainty, while a cluster-based selection of 3-4 Global Gridded Crop Models effectively represents the full ensemble. The contribution of individual Global Gridded Crop Models to overall uncertainty varies depending on region and crop type, emphasizing the importance of considering the impact of specific models when selecting models for local-scale applications. Our results emphasize the importance of model composition and ensemble size in identifying the primary sources of uncertainty in crop yield projections, offering valuable guidance for optimizing ensemble configurations in climate-crop modeling studies tailored to specific applications. A random selection of six global crop grid models and ten global climate models is sufficient to determine the uncertainty of a model ensemble, but the contribution of each crop model to this uncertainty varies by region and crop type, according to a cluster analysis of future crop yield projections.

Crop residues with distinct ecological stoichiometry from inorganic fertilizers can help balance soil ecological stoichiometry and thus increase soil organic matter accumulation. The combined use of inorganic fertilizers and crop residues is expected to alleviate the metabolic limitations of organisms and enhance soil C, N, and P sequestration, hence increasing grain yields. However, the effects of this practice on soil C, N, and P stocks and grain yield remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of 806 paired data to investigate the impact of crop residue return combined with inorganic fertilizer on soil and grain yield across different land uses (paddy, upland, paddy-upland rotation) and soil profiles (0-60 cm). Our findings indicate that crop residue return significantly enhances soil C (8-13%) stocks across all soil layers, particularly in the topsoil (0-20 cm). Soil N (9%) and P (5%) stocks also increase significantly in the topsoil. In uplands, crop residue return can mitigate soil acidification and increase grain yield (by 7%). Moreover, the soil C and N stocks increase depending on the initial soil pH, C and N levels, and C:N ratio. In contrast, the soil P stock increase depends on rainfall, while the grain yield increase is closely linked to the soil texture and fertilizer rate. Our study highlights that crop residue return can increase topsoil C, N, and P stocks, which can benefit crop growth and environmental mitigation efforts.

Although Iran is a suitable location for the cultivation of the Camelina sativa plant, it is not well known. Therefore, in this study, the physicochemical properties of camelina oil obtained from the Soheil cultivars grown in different regions of Iran (Ilam, Kermanshah, Fars, and Hamedan) were determined to be used as an edible oil source. Results showed that regions had a significant effect (p < 0.05) on the physicochemical properties of the extracted oils. Linolenic acid was the predominant fatty acid (30-33%) followed by linoleic and oleic acids. Among the tocopherols, ctocopherol was predominant. In sterol composition, beta-sitosterol and campesterol were the predominant compounds. Oxidative stability and quality parameters of camelina oil were in the ranges of acceptable values for cold-pressed oils. In conclusion, this plant can be cultivated in the different regions of Iran to extract oil to be used as salad and cooking oils and also in food product formulations. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Although warming-induced advances of both leaf-out and flowering are well documented, it remains unclear whether shifts in these phenological phases differ in magnitudes and whether changes have occurred in the length of the inter-stage intervals. Here, we present an extensive synthesis of warming effects on flower-leaf time intervals, using long-term (1963-2014) and in situ data consisting of 11,858 leaf-out and flowering records for 183 species across China. We found that the timing of both spring phenological events was generally advanced, indicating a dominant impact of forcing conditions compared with chilling. Stable time intervals between leaf-out and flowering prevailed for most of the time series despite increasing temperatures; however, some of the investigated cases featured significant changes in the time intervals. The latter could be explained by differences in the temperature sensitivity (ST) between leaf and flower phenology. Greater ST for flowering than for leaf-out caused flowering times to advance faster than leaf emergence. This shortened the inter-stage intervals in leaf-first species and lengthened them in flower-first species. Variation in the time intervals between leaf-out and flowering events may have far-reaching ecological and evolutionary consequences, with implications for species fitness, intra/ inter-species interactions, and ecosystem structure, function, and stability.

Thousand kernel weight (TKW) is an important yield component trait in wheat, and identification of the underlying genetic loci is helpful for yield improvement. We previously identified a stable quantitative trait locus (QTL) QTKW.caas-5DL for TKW in a Doumai/Shi4185 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population. Here we performed fine mapping of QTKW.caas-5DL using secondary populations derived from 15 heterozygous recombinants and delimited the QTL to an approximate 3.9 Mb physical interval from 409.9 to 413.8 Mb according to the Chinese Spring (CS) reference genome. Analysis of genomic synteny showed that annotated genes in the physical interval had high collinearity among CS and eight other wheat genomes. Seven genes with sequence variation and/or differential expression between parents were predicted as candidates for QTKW.caas-5DL based on whole-genome resequencing and transcriptome assays. A kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) marker for QTKW.caas-5DL was developed, and genotyping confirmed a significant association with TKW but not with other yield component traits in a panel of elite wheat cultivars. The superior allele of QTKW.caas-5DL was frequent in a panel of cultivars, suggesting that it had undergone positive selection. These findings not only lay a foundation for map-based cloning of QTKW.caas-5DL but also provide an efficient tool for marker-assisted selection.

An alternative use of the dung that would be profitable and offset the loss as a fuel would be very beneficial. Sweet sorghum silage with yak dung biochar as an additive was compared with a control silage with no additives and three silages with different commercial additives, namely Lactobacillus buchneri, Lactobacillus plantarum and Acremonium cellulase. Biochar-treated silage had a significantly greater concentration of water-soluble carbohydrates than the other silages (76 vs 12.4-45.8 g/kg DM) and a greater crude protein content (75.5 vs 61.4 g/kg DM), lactic acid concentration (40.7 vs 27.7 g/kg DM) and gross energy yield (17.8 vs 17.4 MJ/kg) than the control silage. Biochar-treated and control silages did not differ in in vitro digestibility and in total gas (507 vs 511 L/kg DM) and methane production (57.9 vs 57.1 L/kg DM). Biochar inhibited degradation of protein and water-soluble carbohydrates and enhanced lactic acid production, which improved storability of feed. It was concluded that yak dung biochar is an efficient, cost-effective ensiling additive. The profit could offset the loss of dung as fuel and improve the health of Tibetan people.

The use of cover crops can be considered an ideal solution to reduce the negative impacts of extreme rainfall events on soil erosion. However, there is no enough information about the main cultivated areas of Syria due to the current conflicts and the very few types of research conducted there. Therefore, the main aim of this research was to assess soil erosion (soil loss and sediment concentration) and hydrological response (run-off and infiltration) considering the impact of different types of cropping systems on soil organic matter. To achieve this goal, using erosion plots, five grouped natural rainfall events and soil samples were collected, and infiltration measurements were performed between November 2012 and April 2013 (rainy season) on three different cropping systems (wheat, vetch, bean and control) with different sloping gradients (8% and 20%) in Tartous governorate (W Syria). Our results showed a cumulative rainfall amount from 68.8 to 201 mm during the study period. The highest sediment yield was generated in the control and wheat plots, registering 0.468 and 0.368 kg m(-2), respectively, with an inclination of 8%. For an inclination of 20%, the control and wheat plots registered 1.145 and 0.967 kg m(-2), respectively. In comparison with the control plots, there was a decrease in the total eroded organic matter, which ranged from 0.0579 (control) to 0.0289 (bean) kg m(-2) year(-1) in the plots with 20% inclination, and from 0.0233 (control) to 0.0069 (bean) kg m(-2) year(-1) with 8% inclination. To sum up, bean and vetch play an effective role to mitigate soil erosion, delay run-off and reduce sediment yield. The output of this research provides first insights into the impact of different land uses on soil loss. Also, it could help rural inhabitants and farmers to correctly manage their soils against soil erosion processes.

Several methods have been proposed for semantic root segmentation based on homogeneous, single-source MR datasets. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have enabled automated feature extraction, but comparisons of segmentation accuracy, false positives and transferability are virtually lacking. Here we compare six state-of-the-art methods and propose two improved DL models for semantic root segmentation using a large MR dataset with and without augmented data. We determine the performance of the methods on a homogeneous maize dataset, and a mixed dataset of > 8 species (mixtures), 6 soil types and 4 imaging systems. The generalisation potential of the derived DL models is determined on a distinct, unseen dataset.Results The best performance was achieved by the U-Net models; the more complex the encoder the better the accuracy and generalisation of the model. The heterogeneous mixed MR dataset was a particularly challenging for the non-U-Net techniques. Data augmentation enhanced model performance. We demonstrated the improved performance of deep meta-architectures and feature extractors, and a reduction in the number of false positives.Conclusions Although correction factors are still required to match human labelled root lengths, neural network architectures greatly reduce the time required to compute the root length. The more complex architectures illustrate how future improvements in root segmentation within MR images can be achieved, particularly reaching higher segmentation accuracies and model generalisation when analysing real-world datasets with artefacts-limiting the need for model retraining.

This research tries to explore a suitable strategy for simulating potential yields of highland barley by the WOFOST (WOrld FOod STudies) crop growth model, and further to identify variations in climate conditions and potential yields in TRR from 1961 to 2020 for making policies on adaptation of agricultural production to the climate change impacts on the Tibetan Plateau. Validation results indicated that WOFOST could accurately simulate the potential yields of highland barley with the global radiation estimated by the calibrated Angstrom model. The global radiation during the growth periods decreased at a rate of 0.047 MJ/m(2)a, while the temperature during the growth periods increased at rates ranging from 0.019 to 0.087 degrees C/a, which was greater than the average warming rate of the globe. The simulated potential yields ranged from 10,300 to 14,185 kg/ha in TRR, with an average decreasing rate of 28 kg/ha/a. The decrease in the potential yields was mainly attributed to the shortened critical period caused by warming effects, so cultivation of new varieties of highland barley with longer growth periods is suggested as an achievable strategy for the adaptation of highland barley to climate change in TRR.

JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Exploring the potential of crop type adjustment to improve regional food security, ecological security and net economic benefits is significant for agricultural water management, green production and sustainable development in drylands. Previous studies on the optimization of crop type were mostly concentrated within the region, without considering the impact of interregional food trade on the adjustment of regional crop type. It is difficult to give full play to the advantages of crop type optimization in improving regional food security. This paper introduces the virtual water trade theory into the optimization model of crop type. By quantifying the water footprint, carbon footprint, crop calories and net economic benefits of food crops in Northwest China and Central Asia. On the basis of fully considering farmers' planting willingness in Northwest China and food trade with Central Asian, the relative and absolute comparative advantage index is used as the optimization coefficient of the model. The food security and ecological security of the region, the blue water use efficiency, the green water ratio and the net food efficiency of the provinces (districts) in the region were used as objective functions to construct an open-ended crop type optimization model to optimize the crop type in the region. The results showed that the use of the constructed open crop type optimization model to guide regional food crop type adjustment increased the calories and grey water footprint provided by regional crops by 7.5% and -6.6%, respectively. The provinces in the region have seen varying degrees of improvement in the benefits of blue water use and net economic benefits, particularly in Gansu Province, which have increased by 51.0% and 53.5%, respectively. Due to the effect of crop type adjustment on the regional green water footprint and carbon footprint targets is less than satisfactory. On this basis, effective suggested measures to improve the efficiency of crop green water use and reduce the carbon footprint were proposed. In this study, the combination of relevant measures and grain crop type adjustment can give full play to the role of grain crop type adjustment in alleviating regional water resources and ecological pressure, improving food security, ecological security and sustainable grain production. It is expected to ensure global food security and promote green production and sustainable development of crops.

M.			Biochar incorporation increases winter wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum L</i>.) production with significantly improving soil enzyme activities at jointing stage	CATENA												The responses of yield production and soil nutrients availability to agricultural organic inputs are crucial for cropland management. However, the simultaneous impacts of straw-derived biochar and straw addition on yield production and soil properties (e.g., soil enzyme activities at winter wheat growing stages) as well as their potential relationships remain poorly evaluated in semi-arid areas. Here, a field experiment based on the longterm study (i.e., commenced in 2011) was conducted in the semi-arid Chinese Loess Plateau to explore the responses of soil water storage (SWS), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield and a range of soil biochemical properties to straw-derived biochar and straw addition in 2018-2019 and 2019-2020. The four treatments were: 1) no straw and no biochar (Control), 2) conventional straw mulching (SM), 3) straw incorporated into the soil (SI), and 4) straw-derived biochar incorporated into the soil (BI). We found that the BI treatment on average increased SWS in 0-160 cm soil depth by 13%, 17%, and 21% across entire growing seasons, respectively, when compared to the SM, SI and Control treatments. Enhancements in grain yield and aboveground biomass were related to the BI treatment-induced increases in soil carbon and nitrogen content. The BI treatment had higher soil enzyme activities at jointing stage than at grain filling and maturity stages during winter wheat growing seasons. The mixed-effects models showed there were significant effects of growth stage and soil depth on soil microbial biomass and soil dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen, even when analyzed by each growing season. Moreover, no significant relationships were found between SWS and soil enzyme activities (invertase, urease, catalase, and alkaline phosphatase). Therefore, straw-derived biochar incorporation could be one of the appropriate practices for increasing crop yield and sustaining soil fertility in the Chinese Loess Plateau and other areas with similar climates.

It has been suggested that dietary composition is a key driver of gut microbiota variation; however, how gut microbiota respond to seasonal dietary changes under extreme natural conditions remains poorly understood. Sequencing plant trnL (UAA) region and 16S rRNA gene analysis were employed to determine dietary composition and gut microbiota in freely grazing yaks on the Tibetan plateau. Dietary composition was more diverse in winter than in summer, while Gramineae and Rosaceae were consumed frequently all year. Turnover of seasonal diet and gut microbiota composition occurred consistently. Yaks shifted enterotypes in response to dietary change between warm and cold seasons to best utilize nitrogen and energy, in particular in the harsh cold season. Our findings provide insights into understanding seasonal changes of diet-microbiota linkages in the adaptation of mammals to high altitudes.

The detection of glucose has a direct and significant clinical importance in the management of diabetes. Herein, we demonstrate the application of in-situ synthesized Ti2C-TiO2 MXene nanocomposite for high throughput non-enzymatic electrochemical sensing of glucose. The nanocomposite was synthesized by controlled oxidation of Ti2C-MXene nanosheets using H2O2 at room temperature. The oxidation results in the opening up of Ti2C-MXene nanosheets and the formation of TiO2 nanocrystals on their surfaces as revealed in microscopic and spectroscopic analysis. Nanocomposite exhibited considerably high electrochemical response than parent Ti2C MXene, and hence utilized as a novel electrode material for enzyme-free sensitive and specific detection of glucose. Developed nanocomposite-based non-enzymatic glucose sensor (NEGS) displays a wide linearity range (0.1 mu M-200 mu M, R-2 = 0.992), high sensitivity of 75.32 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), a low limit of detection (0.12 mu M) and a rapid response time (similar to 3s). NEGS has further shown a high level of repeatability and selectivity for glucose in serum spiked samples.

Eco-grass restoration has the functions of increasing vegetation coverage, preventing soil and water loss, conserving water sources, and preventing pika and insect pests. However, the effects of the eco-grass on soil and water conservation are still unclear. Here, a field experiment was conducted to determine the effects of an ecograss species (Elymus tangutorum) on the processes of soil and water loss in alpine hillslopes grasslands on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The results showed that the soil loss rate decreased with the increase of litter biomass in the presence of the selected eco-grass. The presence of eco-grass reduced the soil loss rate by 65% and this was mainly associated with the increase of the rainfall infiltration rate and litter interception rate. Our findings showed that eco-grass could take into account both soil and water conservation and ecological benefits in alpine hillslope grasslands. Therefore, eco-grass should be considered and extensive application to maintain the multifunctions and stability of artificial hillslopes grassland on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

Yet the mechanisms of how afforestation could simultaneously alter both the soil fungal and bacterial communities and its implications for ecosystem management are poorly understood, especially in nitrogen-limited ecosystems. Using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and ITS rRNA genes, the present study investigated the changes in soil properties and soil microorganisms after afforestation of natural grasslands with Chinese pine (Pinus tabuliformis) on the Loess Plateau in China. Results showed that soil bacterial diversity had no significant differences among the grassland (GL), forest-grassland transition zone (TZ), and forestland (FL), while soil fungal diversity in the GL was significantly higher than that in the FL and TZ (P< 0.05). The proportion of shared OTUs in the soil bacterial community was higher than that in the soil fungal community among the three land use types. The dominant bacterial phylum shifted from Proteobacteria to Actinobacteria, while the dominant fungal phylum shifted from Ascomycota to Basidiomycota after the GL conversion to the FL. The functional groups of ECM fungi increased significantly while biotrophic fungi decreased significantly after grassland afforestation. Both the soil bacterial and fungal communities in the TZ showed great similarity with those in the FL In addition, among all examined soil properties, soil nitrogen (N) showed a more significant effect on the soil microbial communities. The reduction of soil N after grassland afforestation resulted in both the structure and function changes in soil microbial communities. Our results demonstrated simultaneously differential changes in the composition and diversity of both soil bacterial and fungal communities after afforestation from grasslands to planted forests.

It is pivotal to groundwater supply as well as the interactions between groundwater and surface water. In the Loess Plateau of China, the baseflow plays a fundamental role in sustaining the aquatic ecosystem. Rational estimation of baseflow is of critical importance for understanding the functioning of the groundwater system and informing management of regional water resources. In this study, a two-well parameterised digital filter was used to separate baseflow from observed daily total streamflow on the Weihe River Basin. Two parameters (maximum baseflow index (BFImax) and the recession constant) of this filter were estimated using UKIH and a recession analysis with physical meaning, respectively. The results show that the baseflow index increased from the upstream to downstream (0.27-0.32) of the Weihe River, and the baseflow of the river is summer dominant. In general, the baseflow has been increasing gradually owing to the implementation of soil conservation measures. This study provides an understanding of baseflow response to seasonal variability and water environmental management in basin scale.

This monu-mental undertaking allows, for the first time, an examination of threats and prioritization of conservation effort, not just for reptiles, but for land vertebrates as a whole. Reptiles are now the largest class of land vertebrates in terms of species numbers. The dynamic nature of reptile taxonomy, the 18 years it took for the Global Reptile Assessment to be completed, the poor state of knowledge for many species - especially of squamates - and the evolving nature of threats, however, all highlight the need for continued monitoring of reptile species and threats. Here we review the status of reptile conservation assessments, and identify the challenges facing the next reptile assessments. We then recommend potential avenues that could facilitate efficient, accurate and timely future assessments.

According to National Forest Inventory (NFI), China has experienced substantial increases in forest cover by benefiting from national afforestation projects initiated in the l980s. However, none of the current land use and land cover (LULC) data sets can reproduce the long-term changes of forest cover derived from NFI in China. Here, by combining NFI and 20 LULC data sets, we developed a new method of reconstructing historical forest cover in China from 1980 to 2015 at 5-year intervals. The new forest cover data set can accurately reproduce the historical changes of forest cover in China during this period. Validated against 3851 field survey samples covering the study period of 1985-2015, the data sets show high accuracy with overall accuracy varying from 76.9% to 99.4%. Accurate long-term forest cover maps have great potential for use in estimating terrestrial carbon, tracking forest management, and other scientific research studies.

This study focuses on assessing, evaluating and managing evapotranspiration in Egyptian Nile Delta over 1997-2017 for thirteen regions. The monthly data of minimum and maximum temperatures, precipitation and solar radiation from November to May were derived from open access data for calculation of reference evapotranspiration and rainfall accounts. Wheat crop coefficient (K-c) values were estimated using the air temperature and base temperature of crop. GWET and BWET were calculated and mapped for each region in the ArcGIS environment. Land use land cover (LULC) was analyzed during 1997, 2005, 2011, and 2017 using Landsat images. The main findings of the research are as follows: (1) average values of crop coefficients Kc-init, Kc-mid and Kc-end were 0.72, 1.13, and 0.41 through initial, middle, and end growing seasons, respectively; (2) the best regions for saving green and blue water were Sidi-Salim, Bilqas, Ar-Riyad, Al-Hamul, and Biyala; (3) the total water saved was 4.80% and 53.12% of blue and green water accounts; (4) high coefficients of determination between precipitation, GWET, and BWET proportions were 0.99 for both. Furthermore, relative irrigation supply is a good indicator for predicting GWET and BWET with determination coefficients of 0.99 and 0.76, respectively. It can be concluded that the data integration of geographic information and LULC changes is the best way for water management and sustainable agro system development under limited water resources.

However, this change is not uniform throughout the world, both spatially and temporally. This study, therefore, examined the spatiotemporal (annual and seasonal) variability and trends of rainfall and temperature over Ethiopia from 1901 to 2020. Monthly rainfall and temperature (maximum, minimum, and mean) data were extracted from the latest version of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU 4.05) dataset. Using long-term seasonal rainfall patterns and pixel-based correlation techniques, five homogeneous rainfall zones were identified. The rainfall and temperature from CRU were validated using observed data from 235 and 145 meteorological stations, respectively. The results revealed that inter-seasonal rainfall and temperature variabilities are more pronounced than interannual variabilities in all rainfall zones. Only 19% (215,700 km(2)) and 3% (33, 900 km(2)) of the country's total area experienced statistically significant (& alpha; = 0.05) decreasing and increasing trends of rainfall, respectively from 1901 to 2020. A statistically significant decreasing trend in rainfall with time was observed during the summer in only one zone that received rainfall in all months. A precipitation concentration index analysis revealed that the country exhibited a moderate to strongly irregular annual and seasonal rainfall distribution, except during the summer when the rainfall distribution was uniform. There was hence a high degree of rainfall seasonality throughout the study period. In addition to the devastating 1984 nationwide drought, Ethiopia also experienced local droughts for a number of 10 to 20 years. Unlike rainfall, there was a significant (& alpha; = 0.05) spatiotemporal increasing trend of temperature over the country. The spatial and temporal increasing trend of mean temperature over 120 years ranged from 0.24(o)C to 1.92(o)C and 0.72(o)C to 1.08(o)C, respectively. This increasing trend was higher in two zones located in the western and northwest parts of Ethiopia and the inflection points occurred after the 1970s in all zones. It is noteworthy that the maximum temperature increased at a lower rate than the minimum temperature. The warming trends and changes in rainfall patterns are likely to increase the frequency of climate extreme events and impact ecosystem services. This study suggests that climate change-sensitive zones require more attention and further study to enhance awareness of climate change in Ethiopia and facilitate adaptation to climate change and inform actions to mitigate adverse effects.

However, how the depth-profile microbial community structure and metabolic limitations change along aridity gradients are still poorly explored. Here, 16S rRNA and ITS amplicon sequencing and ecoenzymatic stoichiometry analysis were used to investigate both bacterial and fungal diversities and resource limitations in 1 m depth profiles across a wide aridity gradient (0.51-0.78) in a semiarid region. Results showed a sharp decrease in microbial diversity with soil depth, accompanied by an increase in microbial phosphorus (P) vs. N (nitrogen) limitation and a decrease in microbial carbon (C) vs. nutrient limitation. Aridity led to a strong shift in microbial community composition, but aridity has a threshold effect on microbial resource limitation through impacts on soil pH and C/P or N/P. When the aridity threshold (1-precipitation/evapotranspiration) exceeds 0.65, relationship between aridity and microbial resource demand was decoupled; but at aridity threshold = 0.65, microbial relative C limitation and C-acquiring enzyme activity dropped. These results suggest that aridity might have a stronger influence on microbial community composition, than on diversity, shaped by inherent soil biotic factors (i.e., MBC:MBP or MBN:MBP). These findings suggest that soil microbial diversity or enzymatic stoichiometry may be not necessary to mirror changes in water availability in the drylands, while aridity would be well explained by microbial community composition.

At the soil, vegetation, and atmosphere interfaces, root water uptake and solar radiation predominantly regulate the dynamics and health of vegetation growth, which can be remotely monitored by satellites, using the soil-plant relationship proxy - solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence. However, most current canopy photosynthesis and fluorescence models do not account for root water uptake, which compromises their applications under water-stressed conditions. To address this limitation, this study integrated photosynthesis, fluorescence emission, and transfer of energy, mass, and momentum in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum system, via a simplified 1D root growth model and a resistance scheme linking soil, roots, leaves, and the atmosphere. The coupled model was evaluated with field measurements of maize and grass canopies. The results indicated that the simulation of land surface fluxes was significantly improved by the coupled model, especially when the canopy experienced moderate water stress. This finding highlights the importance of enhanced soil heat and moisture transfer, as well as dynamic root growth, on simulating ecosystem functioning.					zeng, yijian/C-1207-2008; Su, Z./D-4383-2009; Yu, Qiang/D-3702-2009	zeng, yijian/0000-0002-2166-5314; Yu, Qiang/0000-0001-6950-1821; Su, Zhongbo/0000-0003-2096-1733; YU, LIANYU/0000-0001-9226-1774													1991-959X	1991-9603				MAR 11	2021	14	3					1379	1407		10.5194/gmd-14-1379-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-1379-2021													WOS:000629043800002

The globally growing demand for chickpea suggests superior/climate-resilient varieties, which in turn necessitates the germplasm characterization to unravel underlying genetic variation. Methodology and results A chickpea core collection comprising of diverse 192 accessions which include cultivated Cicer arietinum, and wild C. reticulatum, C. echinospermum, and C. microphyllum species were investigated to analyze their genetic diversity and relationship, by assaying 33 unlinked simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The results amplified a total of 323 alleles (Na), ranging from 2 to 8 with an average of 4.25 alleles per locus. Expected heterozygosity (He) differed from 0.46 to 0.86 with an average of 0.68. Polymorphic information content (PIC) ranged from 0.73 to 0.98 with an average of 0.89. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that most of the variation was among individuals (87%). Cluster analysis resulted in the formation of four distinct clusters. Cluster I represented all cultivated and clusters II, III, and IV comprised a heterogeneous group of cultivated and wild chickpea accessions. Conclusion We report considerable diversity and greater resolving power of SSR markers for assessing variability and interrelationship among the chickpea accessions.

THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS												Leaf rolling is an important agronomic trait related to plant architecture that can change the light condition and photosynthetic efficiency of the population. Here, we isolated one EMS-induced mutant in Chang7-2 background with extreme abaxial rolling leaf, named abrl1. Histological analysis showed that the increased number and area of bulliform cells may contribute to abaxial rolling leaf in abrl1. The F-2 and F-2:3 populations derived from Wu9086 with flat leaves and abrl1 were developed to map abrl1. Non-Mendelian segregation of phenotypic variation was observed in these populations and five genomic regions controlling the leaf rolling index (LRI) were identified, which could be due to the phenotypic difference between Chang7-2 and Wu9086. Moreover, one major QTL qLRI4 on chromosome 4 was further validated and finely mapped to a genetic interval between InDel13 and InDel10, with a physical distance of approximately 277 kb using NIL populations, among which one 602-bp insertion was identified in the promoter region of HD-Zip class IV gene Zm00001d049443 (named as ZmOCL5) of abrl1 compared with wild-type Chang7-2. Remarkably, the 602-bp InDel was associated with LRI in an F-2 population developed by crossing abrl1 mutant and its wild-type. In addition, the 602-bp insertion increased ZmOCL5 promoter activity and expression. Haplotype analysis demonstrated that the 602-bp insertion was a rare mutation event. Taken together, we propose that the rolled leaf in the abrl1 mutant may be partially attributed to the 602-bp insertion, which may be an attractive target for the genetic improvement of LRI in maize.																			0040-5752	1432-2242				NOV	2019	132	11					3047	3062		10.1007/s00122-019-03405-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-019-03405-1								31399756					WOS:000498068400009

This system involves excessive tillage operations that result in numerous resource- and production-vulnerabilities besides impeding environmental-stresses. Likewise, phosphorus is a vital nutrient that limits crop growth and development. It's a matter of great concern when similar to 80% of Indian soils are low to medium in available-P due to its sparing solubility, resulting in crop stress and low yields. Hence, crop productivity, photosynthetic parameters and resilience to nutritional and environmental stresses were assessed in a MWCS using four crop-establishment and tillage management (CETM) practices [FBCT-FBCT (Flat bed-conventional tillage both in maize and wheat); RBCT-RBZT (Raised bed-CT in maize and raised bed-zero tillage in wheat); FBZT-FBZT (FBZT both in maize and wheat); PRBZT-PRBZT (Permanent raised bed-ZT both in maize and wheat)], and five P-fertilization practices [P-100 (100% soil applied-P); P-50+2FSP (50% soil applied-P + 2 foliar-sprays of P through 2% DAP both in maize and wheat); P-50+PSB+AM-fungi; P-50+PSB+AMF+2FSP; and P-0 (100% NK with no-P)] in split-plot design replicated-thrice. The results indicated that double zero-tilled PRBZT-PRBZT system significantly enhanced the grain yield (6.1; 5.4 t ha(-1)), net photosynthetic rate (Pn) (41.68; 23.33 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)), stomatal conductance (SC) (0.44; 0.26 mol H2O m(-2) s(-1)), relative water content (RWC) (83.3; 77.8%), and radiation-use efficiency (RUE) (2.9; 2.36 g MJ(-1)) by 12.8-15.8 and 8.5-44.4% in maize and wheat crops, respectively over conventional tilled FBCT-FBCT. P-50+PSB+AMF+2FSP conjugating soil applied-P, microbial-inoculants and foliar-P, had significantly higher Pn, SC, RUE and RWC over P-100 besides saving similar to 34.7% fertilizer-P under MWCS. P-50+PSB+AMF+2FSP practice also had higher NDVI, PAR, transpiration efficiency and PHI over P-100. Whereas lower stomatal limitation index (Ls) was observed under PRBZT-PRBZT system as compared to the conventional FBCT-FBCT system indicating that P is the limiting factor but not stomata. Hence, optimum P supply through foliar P-fertilization along with other sources resulted in higher grain yield by 21.4% over control. Overall, double zero-tilled PRBZT-PRBZT with crop residue retention at 6 t/ha per year, as well as P-50+PSB+AMF+2FSP in MWCS, may prove beneficial in enhancing the crop productivity and, thereby, bolstering food security in semi-arid south-Asia region.

Consequently, there is increasing interest in exploiting natural products to improve health and production of livestock with no detrimental side effects. In this study, we examined the effect of Astragalus membranaceus root (AMT) supplementation on DM intake, growth performance, rumen fermentation and immunity of Tibetan sheep. Twenty-four male Tibetan sheep (31 +/- 1.4 kg; 9 months old) were assigned randomly to one of four dietary treatments with different levels of AMT: 0, 20. 50 and 80 gikg DM (A(0), A(2), A(5) and A(8), respectively) in addition to their basal diets. Ac, acted as a control group, and measurements were recorded over a 56-d feeding period. Sheep fed with AMT had a higher ave rage daily gain and a lower feed:gain ratio than controls (P <0.001). Rumen concentrations of NH3-N (P < 0.001), total volatile fatty acids (P = 0.028), acetate (P = 0.017) and propionate (P = 0.031) in A(5) and A(8) were higher than those in A(0). The addition of AMT in the feed significantly increased serum antioxidant and immunity factors of the sheep and increased the concentrations of serum interleukin, immunoglobulin and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (P = 0.010). We concluded that AMT can be used as a feed additive to improve growth performance and rumen fermentation and enhance the immunity of Tibetan sheep. Some responses exhibited a dose-dependent response, whereas other did not exhibit a pattern, with an increase in AMT. The addition of 50 and 80 g/kg AMT of total DM intake showed the most promising results. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Dominant role of climate in determining spatio-temporal distribution of potential groundwater recharge at a regional scale	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Knowledge of spatio-temporal groundwater recharge (GR) is crucial for optimizing regional water management practices. Daily potential GR at 58 sites over the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) during 1981-2099 was simulated using the HYDRUS-1D and robust model inputs. The objective was to explore the impacts of soil, vegetation, and climate on potential GR at a regional scale. The median potential GR over the CLP during 1981-2010 was 1.8 cm, accounting for 4.1% of the annual precipitation (P). As dominated by P, the annual potential GR decreased from 18.8 cm (28% of P) at the southeast to 0.0 cm at the northwest. Temporally, consistent low-intensity of GR interspersed with extreme rainfall-induced high GR, being episodic or seasonal depending on sites and years. The lag (average of 5 months) between deep drainage at 3 m depth and rainfall was controlled by climate (i.e., P). From 1981 to 2010, annual potential GR significantly decreased as a result of increased ETp and leaf area index (LAI) over time. A warmer and wetter CLP at the end of this century as predicted by the HadCM3 model may decrease the potential GR because of the increased ETp. This study highlights the dominance of water input factor (P) on the spatial GR and water output factors (ETp and LAI) on the temporal GR. Measures such as water-saving practices and land use optimization should be taken to mitigate climate change effect on groundwater recharge.

However, little is known about their changes in quantity and composition in degraded alpine meadows in the Tibetan plateau. We compared vegetation C density, soil organic carbon (SOC) density, and soil sugars in nondegraded (ND), degraded (DA; following artificial restoration), and extremely degraded (ED) grasslands and analyzed the relation among these parameters by redundancy analysis (RDA) and structural equation models (SEMs). Belowground biomass, soil microbial biomass C, soil microbial biomass nitrogen (N), belowground biomass C density, SOC density, and soil sugars were lower in DA and ED grasslands than in ND grasslands. In addition, the ratio of belowground biomass to aboveground biomass (BAR) decreased with an increase in degradation. The ratio of belowground biomass to aboveground biomass was identified as the main indirect driving force of ecosystem C density by affecting total vegetation C and SOC densities. Soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (SMBC), neutral sugars (NS), and total nitrogen (TN) were identified as main direct driving forces. The ratio of belowground biomass to aboveground biomass altered DOC. SMBC, NS, and TN and, consequently, was the primary driving force for the alpine meadows' ecosystem C density. It was concluded that land management in alpine meadows should include practices that maintain a relatively high BAR in order to curb degradation and increase ecosystem C density.

However, what is the most economical biochar application rate (BCAR) for cotton in saline-alkali soils in arid and semi-arid zones remains unclear. To narrow the gap, this study aims to investigate how biochar application affected the nutrient content, growth, yield, quality, and productivity of cotton, and to find the rational BCAR. The three-year field experiments of biochar application combined with plastic film mulched drip irrigation were conducted for cotton in Xinjiang, China. The biochar was continuously applied to the farmland at 0 (in 2018)+ 0 (in 2019)+ 0 (in 2020), 10 + 10 + 10, NT (no test)+ 25 + 25, 50 + 50 + 30, and 100 + 100 +NT t ha- 1 during cotton growth period of 2018-2020. The cotton growth, yield, and quality indicators were observed and used for computing water-fertilizer productivity. The cost-benefit analysis was referred to recommend a rational BCAR. All four biochar application treatments increased the leaf/stem/root nutrient (N, P, and K) content than control during different cotton growth stages. The daily relative content of chlorophyll increased with the increasing BCAR and were larger at biochar treatments of 50 and 100 t ha- 1 than 0, 10, and 25 t ha -1. The growth and yield-related indicators (plant height, stem diameter, leaf area index and seed yield), irrigation water produc-tivity, and partial fertilizer (N, P, and K) productivity consistently increased than control under biochar appli-cation conditions, and the BCAR of 10 t ha- 1 showed the greatest advantages in enhancing germination rates, cotton yields, water-fertilizer productivities, and financial income than biochar treatments of 0, 25, 50 and 100 t ha -1. However, neither cotton fiber quality indices (length, Micronaire, strength or uniformity index) were significantly affected by biochar applications. Based on the economic analysis, the rational BCAR was 10 t ha- 1 each year (continued for three years) for cotton planting, which was a best dose that could be applied to arid zones and have not been reported before.

Most of the Earth System Models (ESMs) project increases in future Net Primary Productivity (NPP) due to climate warming. However, large uncertainty exists in projected NPP due to future P limitation. Subtropical China is a region with high vegetation NPP, but its forests are mostly P limited. In this study, we used the simulations of Atmospheric-Vegetation Interaction Model 2 (AVIM2) to diagnose the P limitation in forests in this region, and found that climate warming in the period of 1951-2010 had enhanced P limitation. The P demand during 1981-2010 for Evergreen Broad-leaved Forest (EBF) and Evergreen Needle-leaved Forest (ENF) are 1.67 and 1.8 times than that during 1951-1980, respectively. The observed current Available Soil P (ASP) density in 4 representative forest sites in subtropical China varied between 940 and 2365 and the P demands account for 0.86% to 25.5% of the ASP for the period of 1951-2010. Future P demands are estimated to account for 3.2% to 68.3% of the current ASP at the end of this century for RCP8.5. Therefore, forests, especially plantations, in subtropical China are facing high risks of P limitation.					wang, zhaosheng/AAX-1350-2021	wang, zhaosheng/0000-0001-7307-2249; Wang, Na/0000-0002-7338-8515; Yan, Huimin/0000-0003-0678-0397														2071-1050				APR 2	2019	11	8							2202	10.3390/su11082202	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11082202													WOS:000467752200015

However, currently, little is known about the service life for the PBAT/PLA mulch films. Herein, PBAT/PLA mulch films are subjected to indoor UV-accelerated degradation (UAD experiments and field cultivation environment degradation (CED) experiments to systematically investigate the relationship between UAD and CED processes. Results demonstrate that 10 days of indoor UAD treatment corresponds to around 120 days aging under outdoor CED conditions. Using eight PBAT/PLA evaluation indicators (haze, elongation at break, tensile strength, gel content, light transmittance, polydispersity index, M-n, M-w), we established a service life prediction model for PBAT/PLA mulch films based on short-term indoor UAD experiments, which could accurately estimate the long-term service life of the mulch films in the field. In particular, using the haze value, near-perfect correlation (R-2 = 0.995 for eq. 1 and R-2 = 0.993 for eq. 2) was found between CED days and UAD days. The establishment of these reliable predictive models for the service lifetime of PBAT/PLA mulch films will avoid the undesirable premature breakdown during crop growth, thus fostering end-user confidence in eco-friendly biodegradable mulch films.

However, it is unclear how the radial growth of treeline trees on the Tibetan Plateau responds to climate warming. We totally collected 534 ring cores of spruce (Picea spp.) and fir (Abies spp.) genera from 17 sites on the east edge of the Tibetan Plateau. The pairwise correlations between the ring width index of all trees in a population were analysed before and after the rapid warming, respectively, and the correlations between individual tree growth and monthly mean temperature were accordingly studied. The proportions of trees positively correlated with spring and growing season temperature were also counted. The results showed that the growth coherency of the trees decreased for both spruce and fir, but the coherency of the correlation between individual tree growth and monthly temperature decreased only for fir. The proportion of spruce positively responding to the spring and growing season temperature increased while that of fir did not change, except for those in the wetter sites. The spatial variability of trees' response to the spring and growing season temperature coincided with the precipitation decrease. The results indicate that higher spring and growing season temperatures are beneficial for the radial growth of spruce but could cause drought stress to fir. We conclude that drought stress induced by climate warming may drive the divergent responses and the spatial variability for trees on the east edge of the Tibetan Plateau.

Prioritizing forest conservation strategies using a multi-attribute decision model to address concerns with the survival of the endangered dragon tree<i> (Dracaena</i><i> ombet</i> Kotschy and Peyr.)	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												The globally endangered Dracaena ombet is one of the ten dragon multipurpose tree species in arid ecosystems. Anthropogenic and natural factors are now impacting the sustainability of the species. This study was conducted to prioritize criteria and alternative strategies for conservation of the species using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) model by involving all relevant stakeholders in the Desa'a dry Afromontane forest, northern Ethiopia. Information about the potential alternative strategies and the criteria for their evaluation were first collected from experts, personal experiences and literature reviews. Afterwards, they were validated using stakeholders' focus group discussions. Five candidate strategies with three evaluation criteria were considered for prioritization using the AHP techniques. The overall priority ranking value of the stakeholders showed that the ecological criterion was deemed as the most essential factor for the choice of the alternative strategies, followed by the economic and social criteria. The minimum cut-off strategy, combining exclosures with collection of only 5% of plant parts from the species, soil and water conservation and habitat protection man-agement options, was selected as the best alternative strategy for sustainable D. ombet conservation. The live-lihood losses due to the selected strategy should be compensated by the collection of non-timber forest products, poultry farming, home gardens, rearing small ruminants, beekeeping and agroforestry. This approach may be extended to study other dragon tree species and explore strategies for the conservation of other arid ecosystems.

Currently, studies characterizing leaf-scale WUE-I responses are rare and key questions have not been answered. In particular, (1) What shape does the response function take? (2) Are there maximum intrinsic (WUEi; WUEi max) and instantaneous WUE (WUEinst; WUEinst-max) at the corresponding saturation irradiances (Ii-sat and Iinst-sat)? This study developed WUEi-I and WUEinst-I models sharing the same non-asymptotic function with previously published A(n-I) and g(s-I) models. Observation-modeling intercomparison was conducted for field-grown plants of soybean (C-3) and grain amaranth (C-4) to assess the robustness of our models versus the non-rectangular hyperbola models (NH models). Both types of models can reproduce WUE-I curves well over light-limited range. However, at light-saturated range, NH models overestimated WUEi-max and WUEinst-max and cannot return Ii-sat and Iinst-sat due to its asymptotic function. Moreover, NH models cannot describe the down-regulation of WUE induced by high light, on which our models described well. The results showed that WUEi and WUEinst increased rapidly within low range of I, driven by uncoupled photosynthesis and stomatal responsiveness. Initial response rapidity of WUEi was higher than WUEinst because the greatest increase of A(n) and T-r occurred at low gs. C4 species showed higher WUEi-max and WUEinst-max than C-3 species-at similar Ii sat and Iinst sat. Our intercomparison highlighted larger discrepancy between WUEi-I and WUEinst-I responses in C-3 than C-4 species, quantitatively characterizing an important advantage of C-4 photosynthetic pathway-higher A(n) gain but lower T-r cost per unit of g(s) change. Our models can accurately return the wealth of key quantities defining species-specific WUE-I responses-besides A(n-I) and g(s-I) responses. The key advantage is its robustness in characterizing these entangled responses over a wide I range from light-limited to light-inhibitory light intensities, through adopting the same analytical framework and the explicit and consistent definitions on these responses. Our models are of significance for physiologists and modelers-and also for breeders screening for genotypes concurrently achieving maximized photosynthesis and optimized WUE.

The overlooked non-rainfall water input sibling of fog and dew: Daily water vapor adsorption on a !Nara hummock in the Namib Sand Sea	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The Namib Sand Sea is a hyper-arid coastal fog desert, with limited vegetation scattered across the extensive sand dunes. Minimal and unpredictable rainfall, along with proximity to the ocean, make non-rainfall water inputs (NRWIs), i.e. fog, dew and water vapor adsorption, an important part of the ecohydrology. We studied water accumulation across an elevated hummock formed around a !Nara (Acanthosicyos horridus) thicket in the Namib dunes during February 2020. Continuous measurements of temperature and relative humidity (RH) gradients between the soil and the air were complemented with three nights of intensive NRWI observations using 14 micro-lysimeters. While the overall objective was to study total NRWI accumulation, micro-lysimeter placement was designed to address additional questions about how NRWI accumulation was affected by hummock microtopography and the position of the !Nara thicket. Water vapor adsorption was the primary form of NRWI, occurring nightly and accounting for at least half of the total water accumulation, even on nights with fog. This was confirmed by the measured water vapor pressure gradients between the air and the soil, which indicated nightly downward vapor fluxes. Actual vapor pressures in the air were similar on nights with and without fog, indicating fog was mostly determined by temperature. Soil RH was used as a proxy for soil water content and was found to be strongly correlated with air RH. Average nighttime air RH was correlated with total nighttime water accumulation with an R-2 of 0.69-0.78. Average nighttime air RH was correlated with total nighttime water accumulation with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.69-0.78. Even though measurements were limited to the soil, comparison between micro-lysimeters placed on the hummock inside and outside the !Nara thicket indicated consistent, but not significant, lower water contents inside the thicket, suggesting interception of water vapor by the spines and stems of the !Nara. We conclude that water vapor adsorption, though not always appreciated as such, is a large contributor to total NRWI. The fact that water vapor adsorption was the primary NRWI in sand, which has a much lower surface area than most other soil types, and in a place where fog occurs regularly, has implications for deserts worldwide.

This lack of information endangers the sustainability of these fragile ecosystems. The current study assessed spatial-temporal variations of soil drought, as indicated by dried soil layers (DSL), at a watershed scale, and tested the hypothesis that soil drought in deep profiles is controlled by the combined effects of meteorological processes, land use, and topography. We measured SM to a depth of 500 cm on 20 occasions at 73 locations from 2013 to 2016 at a small watershed on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). We also collected data on possible environmental factors including meteorological variables, land use, topographical elements, and soil properties. The DSLs occurred at > 90% of the sampling sites within the watershed, and the spatially and temporally averaged DSL formation depth (DSLFD), DSL thickness (DSLT) and soil water content within the DSL (DSL-SWC) were 125 cm, 257 cm, and 10.4%, respectively. This suggests that 51.4% of the 500-cm-profile is drying out below 125 cm. The DSLFD, DSLT and DSL-SWC demonstrated a moderate degree of variability (20% < CV < 84%) in space, and showed a moderate, moderate and weak temporal variability, in time, respectively. The temporal series of the mean spatial DSLT and DSLFD were significantly correlated with climatic variables. The spatial variation of the mean temporal DSL-SWC differed significantly among the land uses and between shaded and sunlit aspects. We found that plan curvature, slope gradient, clay and silt content regulated DSLs in both space and time. This result verified our hypothesis that meteorological processes, land use, and topography play an essential role in shaping DSL variation and distribution pattern. Taking DSL reclamation into account in the study area, grassland would be the optimum land use type. Understanding this information is helpful for watershed soil and water conservation, and soil drought meditation via the best management practices in the CLP and other water-limited regions with deep soils.

Sixteen 3-year-old yak steers (124 +/- 15.3 kg) were divided randomly into two groups and were offered either heat-treated rapeseed (HTR) or rapeseed meal (CONT). The yaks were allowed 14 days for adjustment and measurements were made over 120 d. There was no difference in DMI between groups (p = 0.67), but average daily gain tended to be higher (p < 0.056) and feed to gain ratio tended to be lower (p = 0.050) in HTR than in CONT yaks. Meat from HTR yaks was more tender (p = 0.006), had higher intramuscular fat (p = 0.013), and had lower cholesterol content (p = 0.009) than from CONT yaks. In addition, the atherogenic index was lower (0.37 vs. 0.43; p = 0.049), the PUFA:SFA ratio was higher (0.55 vs. 0.37; p = 0.049), and the n-6:n-3 (n-6 PUFA to n-3 PUFA) ratio was lower (2.76 vs. 4.78; p = 0.003) in HTR than in CONT yaks, which all favoured the HTR yaks. Meat from HTR yaks met human health standards of a PUFA:SFA ratio of above 0.4 and n-6:n-3 ratio of less than 4, whereas meat from CONT yaks just missed these standards.

Inputs of inorganic fertilizer and crop residue are key cropland anthropogenic managements, with potential to alter their soil ecological stoichiometry. We conducted a global synthesis of 682 data pairs to quantify the responses of soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) and grain yields to combined inputs of crop residue plus inorganic fertilizer compared with only inorganic fertilizer application. Crop residue inputs enhance soil C (10.5%-12%), N (7.63%-9.2%), and P (2.62%-5.13%) contents, with an increase in C:N (2.51%-3.42%) and C:P (7.27%-8.00%) ratios, and grain yields (6.12%-8.64%), indicating that crop residue alleviated soil C limitation caused by inorganic fertilizer inputs alone and was able to sustain balanced stoichiometry. Moreover, the increase in soil C and C:N(P) ratio reached saturation in similar to 13-16 years after crop residue return, while grain yield increase trend discontinued. Furthermore, we identified that the increased C, N, and P contents and C:N(P) ratios were regulated by the initial pH and C content, and the increase in grain yield was not only related to soil properties, but also negatively related to the amount of inorganic N fertilizer input to a greater extent. Given that crop residual improvement varies with soil properties and N input levels, we propose a predictive model to preliminary evaluate the potential for crop residual improvement. Particularly, we suggest that part of the global budget should be used to subsidize crop residue input management strategies, achieving to a win-win situation for agricultural production, ecological protection, and climate change mitigation.

Here, we provide an estimate of the spatial patterns of cropland susceptibility to erosion by sheet and rill, gully, wind, tillage, and root crops harvesting and report the co-occurrence of these processes using a multi-model approach. In addition, to give a global overview of potential future changes, we identify the locations where these multiple concurrent soil erosion processes may be expected to intersect with projected dry/wet climate changes by 2070. Of a modelled 1.48 billion hectares (B ha) of global cropland, our results indicate that 0.56 B ha (-36% of the total area) are highly susceptible (classes 4 and 5) to a single erosion process, 0.27 B ha (-18% of the total area) to two processes and 0.02 B ha (1.4% of the total area) to three or more processes. An estimated 0.82 B ha of croplands are susceptible to possible increases in water (0.68 B ha) and wind (0.14 B ha) erosion. We contend that the presented set of estimates represents a basis for enhancing our foundational knowledge on the geography of soil erosion at the global scale. The generated insight on multiple erosion processes can be a useful starting point for decision-makers working with ex-post and ex-ante policy evaluation of the UN Sustainable Development Goal 15 (Life on Land) activities.

PRECISION AGRICULTURE												Sustainability in our food and fiber agriculture systems is inherently knowledge intensive. It is more likely to be achieved by using all the knowledge, technology, and resources available, including data-driven agricultural technology and precision agriculture methods, than by relying entirely on human powers of observation, analysis, and memory following practical experience. Data collected by sensors and digested by artificial intelligence (AI) can help farmers learn about synergies between the domains of natural systems that are key to simultaneously achieve sustainability and food security. In the quest for agricultural sustainability, some high-payoff research areas are suggested to resolve critical legal and technical barriers as well as economic and social constraints. These include: the development of holistic decision-making systems, automated animal intake measurement, low-cost environmental sensors, robot obstacle avoidance, integrating remote sensing with crop and pasture models, extension methods for data-driven agriculture, methods for exploiting naturally occurring Genotype x Environment x Management experiments, innovation in business models for data sharing and data regulation reinforcing trust. Public funding for research is needed in several critical areas identified in this paper to enable sustainable agriculture and innovation.

Double zero tillage and foliar phosphorus fertilization coupled with microbial inoculants enhance maize productivity and quality in a maize-wheat rotation	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Maize is an important industrial crop where yield and quality enhancement both assume greater importance. Clean production technologies like conservation agriculture and integrated nutrient management hold the key to enhance productivity and quality besides improving soil health and environment. Hence, maize productivity and quality were assessed under a maize-wheat cropping system (MWCS) using four crop-establishment and tillage management practices [FBCT-FBCT (Flat bed-conventional tillage both in maize and wheat); RBCT-RBZT (Raised bed-CT in maize and raised bed-zero tillage in wheat); FBZT-FBZT (FBZT both in maize and wheat); PRBZT-PRBZT (Permanent raised bed-ZT both in maize and wheat], and five P-fertilization practices [P-100 (100% soil applied-P); P-50 + 2FSP (50% soil applied-P + 2 foliar-sprays of P through 2% DAP both in maize and wheat); P-50 + PSB + AM-fungi; P-50 + PSB + AMF + 2FSP; and P-0 (100% NK with no-P)] in split-plot design replicated-thrice. Double zero-tilled PRBZT-PRBZT system significantly enhanced the maize grain, starch, protein and oil yield by 13.1-19% over conventional FBCT-FBCT. P-50 + PSB + AMF + 2FSP, integrating soil applied-P, microbial-inoculants and foliar-P, had significantly higher grain, starch, protein and oil yield by 12.5-17.2% over P-100 besides saving 34.7% fertilizer-P both in maize and on cropping-system basis. P-50 + PSB + AMF + 2FSP again had significantly higher starch, lysine and tryptophan content by 4.6-10.4% over P-100 due to sustained and synchronized P-bioavailability. Higher amylose content (24.1%) was observed in grains under P-50 + PSB + AMF + 2FSP, a beneficial trait due to its lower glycemic-index highly required for diabetic patients, where current COVID-19 pandemic further necessitated the use of such dietary ingredients. Double zero-tilled PRBZT-PRBZT reported greater MUFA (oleic acid, 37.1%), MUFA: PUFA ratio and P/S index with 6.9% higher P/S index in corn-oil (an oil quality parameter highly required for heart-health) over RBCT-RBCT. MUFA, MUFA: PUFA ratio and P/S index were also higher under P-50 + PSB + AMF + 2FSP; avowing the obvious role of foliar-P and microbial-inoculants in influencing maize fatty acid composition. Overall, double zero-tilled PRBZT-PRBZT with crop residue retention at 6 t/ha per year along with P-50 + PSB + AMF + 2FSP while saving 34.7% fertilizer-P in MWCS, may prove beneficial in enhancing maize productivity and quality so as to reinforce the food and nutritional security besides boosting food, corn-oil and starch industry in south-Asia and collateral arid agro-ecologies across the globe.

This present study focuses on the role of WRKY transcription factors on drought tolerance in tomato, Solanum lycopersicum L., which is a significant vegetable crop. WRKY transcription factors are a group of proteins that regulate a wild range of growth and developmental processes in plants such as seed germination and dormancy and the stress response. These transcription factors are defined by the presence of a DNA-binding domain, namely, the WRKY domain. It is well-known that WRKY transcription factors can interact with a variety of proteins and therefore control downstream activities. It aims to simulate the effect of curcumin, a bioactive compound with regulatory capacity, on the protein-protein interaction events by WRKY transcription factors with an emphasis on drought stress. It was found that curcumin binds to WRKY with an energy of -11.43 kcal/mol with inhibitory concentration (K-i) 0.12 mM and has the potential to improve fruit quality and reinforce drought tolerance of S. lycopersicum, according to the results based on bioinformatics tools. The root means square deviation (RMSD) of the C-alpha, the backbone of 2AYD with ligand coupled complex, displayed a very stable structure with just a little variation of 1.89 angstrom. MD simulation trajectory of C alpha atoms of 2AYD bound to Curcumin revealed more un-ordered orientation in PC1 and PC10 modes and more toward negative correlation from the initial 400 frames during PCA. Establishing the binding energies of the ligand-target interaction is essential in order to characterize the compound's binding affinity to the drought transcription factor. We think we have identified a phyto-agent called curcumin that has the potential to enhance the drought tolerance. Compared to the part of the mismatch repair-base technique that can be used to fix drought related genes, curcumin performed better in a drop-in crop yield over time, and it was suggested that curcumin is a potential candidate factor for improving drought tolerance in tomatoes, and it needs future validation by experiments in laboratory and field.

Slope position and rhizosphere effect (RE) are two critical drivers of biological P utilization, but their unknown potential interaction limits the improvement of ecological restoration under P limitation. To bridge this gap, we investigated the interaction on plant-microbe P utilization by quantifying the REs at different slope positions (top, middle, and bottom) of a typical artificial forest on the Loess Plateau, China. The results showed that: (1) most of the positive REs increased by 1.5 to 5.6 times with decreasing slope position, which reversed the resource distribution trend along the slope. (2) Due to nutrient competition, plant and microbial P limitation exhibited contrasting patterns across the slope, both of which were aggravated by the RE on soil nitrogen (N)-P imbalance and litter carbon (C):P imbalance, respectively. (3) Conversely, plant P resorption and the rhizosphere process of microbial P utilization had a synergistic relationship to achieve P co-utilization in the plant-soil-microbe system. (4) The decreasing slope position promoted this P co-utilization by regulating the REs on resource quantities and resource imbalances. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of rhizosphere processes and the mediation of slope position in biological P utilization, further revealing that the rhizosphere-linked synergism of P utilization by plants and microbes may counteract the adverse consequences of P limitation on ecological restoration.

However, the quantification of DOC in forest ecosystems remains uncertain. Here, the processed-based biogeochemical model TRIPLEX-DOCwas modified by optimizing the function of soil organic carbon distribution with increasing depths, as well as DOC sorption-desorption efficiency. The model was validated by field measurements of DOC concentration and flux at five forest sites and Beijiang River basin in monsoon regions of China. Model validation indicated that seasonal patterns of DOC concentration across climatic zones were different, and these differences were captured by our model. Importantly, the modified model performed better than the original model. Indeed, model efficiency of the modified model increased from -0.78 to 0.19 for O horizon predictions, and from -0.46 to 0.42 for the mineral soils predictions. Likewise, DOC fluxes were better simulated by the modified model. At the site scale, the simulated DOC fluxes were strongly correlated with the observed values (R-2 = 0.97, EF = .91). At the regional scale, the DOC flux predicted in the Beijiang River basin was 16.44 kg C/ha, whichwas close to the observed value of 17 kg C/ha. Using sensitivity analysis, we showed that temperature, precipitation and temperature sensitivity of DOC decomposition (Q(10)) were the most sensitive parameters when predicting DOC concentrations and fluxes in forest soils. We also found that both the percentage of DOC flux to forest net ecosystem productivity, and the retention of DOC by mineral soil were highly correlated with the amount of precipitation. Overall, our model validations indicated that the modified TRIPLEX-DOC model is a useful tool for simulating the dynamics of DOC concentrations and fluxes in forest ecosystems. We highlight that more accurate estimates of parameter Q(10) in deep mineral soils can reduce model uncertainty, when simulating DOC concentrations and fluxes in forest soils. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we investigated the nitrifying population and community dynamics in response to fertilization in paddy soil under long-term treatment with different urea concentrations (0, 100, 200, and 300 kg N ha(-1); designated N0, N100, N200, and N300, respectively). The community structure of nitrifiers, including comammox, was changed by long-term N fertilizers input, which also enhanced AOB abundance and comammox clade A/B abundance ratio, whereas it did not affect AOA abundance. Nevertheless, the microbial population sizes and community compositions remained largely similar following short-term fertilization throughout one rice-growing season. Furthermore, by employing a (NO3)-N-15 pool dilution technique in combination with chlorate and 1-octyne inhibition, we conducted a soil microcosm incubation without substrate supplementation to distinguish the relative contribution of comammox to gross ammonia oxidation from those of AOA and AOB. Comammox exhibited higher nitrification activity in soils treated with more N fertilizers, with the contribution increasing from 34 % (N0) to 75 % (N300), although its abundance was not dominant. This could be attributed to the repeated N-based fertilization, which reduced the soil pH, thereby decreasing the soil-free ammonia concentration. In contrast, the contribution of AOA declined from 57 % (N0) to 19 % (N300), while that of AOB only accounted for a minor fraction (<25 %) despite being in high abundance. Altogether, our findings provide evidence that the activity of nitrifying guilds is more valuable than their abundance and provide insights into the potential functional significance of comammox in the nitrification process in rice paddy systems.

This study aims to model the Water Footprint (WF) by using the four kernels of Gaussian processes models (Polynomial, Normalized Poly, Radial Basis Function RBF, and Pearson Universal Function PUK) and select the best kernel with best climate scenario. This study investigates the predicting WF of maize based on meteorological variables including maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), mean temperature (Tmean), solar radiation (SR), wind speed (WS), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), Extraterrestrial radiation (Ra) relative humidity (RH) and crop coefficient (Kc) by applying ten scenarios of climate variables in the Egyptian Nile Delta, Ad Daqahliyah Governorate for predicting blue WF of maize during 2000-2019. The main findings are following as, firstly; based on developing four kernels, the performance of the PUK kernel in predicting blue WF is far better than the other three kernels followed by the Poly kernel. Secondly; for PUK kernel, model 7 (Tmax, Tmin, Tmean, WS, Sunshine Hours (SH), VPD and SR) has good performance which is close to models 8 (model 7 + Ra), model 9 (model 7 + Ra and RH) and model 10 (all inputs). Thirdly; in all four kernels, the error rate in small blue WF values is higher than the other values, moreover, the error value decreases at the medium blue WF values, while, it increases again at large WF values. Therefore, the developed models in this study can help and promote the decision makers to manage and secure the water resources management under the extreme climate events.					kumar, Pankaj/HPF-8395-2023; Pande, Chaitanya Baliram/ISU-8862-2023; Ramezani Etedali, Hadi/AFK-1402-2022; Arshad, Arfan/AAX-6947-2021; Bhat, Shakeel/AAI-9957-2021; Mohammed (PhD), Safwan/AAA-7126-2019; Ramezani Etedali, Hadi/AAF-8691-2022; Arshad, Arfan/JFS-3712-2023; Elbeltagi, Ahmed/P-4614-2018; Deng, Jinsong/A-9301-2015; Islam, Abu Reza Md.

To investigate this, a three-year field experiment with drip irrigation under plastic film mulch was conducted from 2018 to 2020 in a saline-alkali cotton and sugarbeet field in Xinjiang, China. The experiment examined the influences of different biochar application rates (BAR) on the distribution and variations of soil Na+ and K+ contents, soil nutrient contents (NO3--N, NH4+-N, soil organic carbon, available phosphorus, and available potassium), soil salt content and accumulation. Four BAR treatments of 0, 10, 50, and 100 t ha(-1), namely CK, B10, B50, and B100 were designed in 2018, with adjusted in 2019 and 2020 based on the former 2 year's results, namely CK, B10, B25 (25 t ha(-1)), B50, and B100 in 2019, and CK, B10, B25, and B30 (30 t ha(-1)) in 2020. The results indicated that increasing BAR significantly increased Na+, K+, and soil nutrient contents in cotton and sugarbeet fields. Soil salinity were the highest in inter-rows, followed by narrow and wide rows, and salt accumulated at 0-60 cm depth the most. Weighted-average planar soil salt storage positively correlated with BAR, with lower soil salt contents for sugarbeet than cotton at the same depth. Based on the effects of different BAR on soil ion concents, soil nutrients, and soil salinity, we recommended 10 t ha 1 as an optimal BAR for improving the chemical environment of saline-alkali soil, and sugarbeet as an effective crop for reducing soil salinity. These findings provided valuable technique parameters for biochar application in saline-alkali land.

In this study, strain Bacillus subtilis LZU-GM was isolated from Pakistani traditional fermented sourdough and could degrade 73.7% of gluten in 24 h in vitro. Strain LZUGM was employed for practical application to investigate gluten degradation in mice models. The results showed that strain LZU-GM was colonized in mice and the survival rate was around 0.95 % (P < 0.0001). The gluten degradation was 3-fold higher in the small intestine of the strain LZU-GM treated mice group remaining 1511.96 ng/mL of gluten peptides than the untreated mice group (6500.38 ng/mL). Immunochemical analysis showed that gluten-treated mice established positive antigliadin antibodies (AGA) in serum (IgA, IgG, and anti-TG2 antibodies) as compared to the strain LZU-GM treatment group. Furthermore, the number of IFN-& gamma;, TNF-& alpha;, IL10, and COX-2 cells decrease in the lamina propria of the strain LZU-GM treatment group (P < 0.0001). Microbial community bar plot analysis showed that Lactobacillus, Dubosiella, and Enterococcus genera were restored and stabilized in the LZU-GM treatment group while Blautia and Ruminococcus were found lower. The oral gavage of probiotic strain LZU-GM might be useful for gluten metabolism in the intestine during digestion and would be a long-term dietary treatment for CeD management.

Nanofertilizers for agricultural and environmental sustainability	CHEMOSPHERE												Indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers in the agricultural production systems to keep pace with the food and nutritional demand of the galloping population had an adverse impact on ecosystem services and environmental quality. Hence, an alternative mechanism is to be developed to enhance farm production and environmental sustainability. A nanohybrid construct like nanofertilizers (NFs) is an excellent alternative to overcome the negative impact of traditional chemical fertilizers. The NFs provide smart nutrient delivery to the plants and proves their efficacy in terms of crop productivity and environmental sustainability over bulky chemical fertilizers. Plants can absorb NFs by foliage or roots depending upon the application methods and properties of the particles. NFs enhance the biotic and abiotic stresses tolerance in plants. It reduces the production cost and mitigates the environmental footprint. Multitude benefits of the NFs open new vistas towards sustainable agriculture and climate change mitigation. Although supra-optimal doses of NFs have a detrimental effect on crop growth, soil health, and environmental outcomes. The extensive release of NFs into the environment and food chain may pose a risk to human health, hence, need careful assessment. Thus, a thorough review on the role of different NFs and their impact on crop growth, productivity, soil, and environmental quality is required, which would be helpful for the research of sustainable agriculture.

Fire globally reduces the tree covered area and vegetation carbon storage by 10%. Regionally, the effects are much stronger, up to 20% for certain latitudinal bands, and 17% in savanna regions. Global fire effects on total carbon storage and carbon turnover times are lower with the effect on gross primary productivity (GPP) close to 0. We find the strongest impacts of fire in savanna regions. Climatic conditions in regions with the highest burned area differ from regions with highest absolute fire impact, which are characterized by higher precipitation. Our estimates of fire-induced vegetation change are lower than previous studies. We attribute these differences to different definitions of vegetation change and effects of anthropogenic land use, which were not considered in previous studies and decreases the impact of fire on tree cover. Accounting for fires significantly improves the spatial patterns of simulated tree cover, which demonstrates the need to represent fire in dynamic vegetation models. Based upon comparisons between models and observations, process understanding and representation in models, we assess a higher confidence in the fire impact on tree cover and vegetation carbon compared to GPP, total carbon storage and turnover times. We have higher confidence in the spatial patterns compared to the global totals of the simulated fire impact. As we used an ensemble of state-of-the-art fire models, including effects of land use and the ensemble median or mean compares better to observational datasets than any individual model, we consider the here presented results to be the current best estimate of global fire effects on ecosystems.

Synthesis of Ni@Au core-shell magnetic nanotubes for bioapplication and SERS detection	COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS												Ni@Au core-shell nanotubes were synthesized using a two-stage method including Ni nanotubes growth in pores of PET template and their electroless wet-chemical functionalizing with gold. The structure, morphology, chemical composition, surface condition and magnetic properties of Ni@Au nanotubes were comprehensively studied. Cellular cytotoxicity of Ni and Ni@Au nanotubes was evaluated demonstrating its strong reduction when nanotubes were coated with Au layer. The gold layer had a granular structure with some agglomerations resulting in surface irregularities which is advantageous for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).

This is a gradual decline in meadow patch coverage, which can result in soil and surface water loss due to increased bare soil surface. However, little is known about how the loss of mattic epipedons alters soil erosion processes in alpine regions. This study sheds light on this topic by conducting simulated rainfall experiments with different rainfall intensities to assess runoff and sediment generation. We selected representative degraded alpine meadows on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in China. The observed temporal variations of runoff and soil loss rates were explained by the presence of two stages of meadow patch coverage decline: an increasing and a relatively stable stage. Compared to 30% and 60% meadow patch coverage, 90% meadow patch coverage displayed an extended increasing stage with delayed entrance into the stable stage during the rainfall period. The runoff coefficients were significantly higher in 90% and 30% meadow patch coverage than in 60%. The sediment concentrations were significantly lower in 90% and 60% meadow patch coverage than in 30%. It is worth stressing that 90% meadow patch coverage could prompt more rainfall flowing as runoff and reduce sediment under different rainfall intensities. The complex mosaic-pattern formed by meadow and bald patches changed the hydrological response of the soil, decreasing runoff coefficient in 60% meadow patch coverage. The destruction, reduction or even disappearance of some mattic epipedons led to a higher sediment concentration in 30% meadow patch coverage. The meadow patch coverage exerted a greater influence on sediment yield than on runoff volume, although it was generally affected by rainfall intensity. Our findings highlight the importance of maintaining runoff and reducing sediment through the presence of mattic epipedons. Mattic epipedons appear as an effective soil erosion control feature, and this study offers a theoretical guidance for planning adaptive management strategies for degraded alpine meadows on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

Despite decades of scientific research, no consensus has been achieved on the impact of climate conditions on soil respiration (Rs). Here, we recon-structed 110 published studies across diverse biomes, magnitudes, and driving variables to evaluate how Rs responds to N addition, altered precipitation (both enhanced and reduced precipitation or precipitation changes), and warming. Our findings show that N addition significantly increased Rs by 44 % in forests and decreased it by 19 % and 26 % in croplands and grasslands, respectively (P < 0.05). In forests and croplands, altered precipitation significantly increased Rs by 51 % and 17 % (all, P < 0.05), respectively, whereas impacts on grassland were insignificant. In comparison, warming stimulated Rs by 62 % in forests but inhibited it by 10 % in croplands (all, P < 0.05), whereas impacts on grassland were again insignificant.

Several empirical and physically based tools have been proposed to assess erosion induced soil losses and runoff driving the processes, from plot to regional spatial scales. The main goal of this research is to evaluate the performance of the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model in predicting runoff in comparison with field experiments in the Al-Sabahia region of Western Syria in three ecosystems: agricultural lands (AG), burned forest (BF) and forest (FO). To achieve this, field experimental plots (2*1.65*0.5 m) were prepared to obtain runoff observation data between September 2012 and December 2013. In addition, the input data (atmospheric forcing, soil, slope, land management) were prepared to run the WEPP model to estimate the runoff. The results indicate that the average observed runoffs in the AG, BF and FO were 12.54 +/- 1.17, 4.81 +/- 0.97 and 1.72 +/- 0.16 mm/event, respectively, while the simulated runoffs in the AG, BF and FO were 15.15 +/- 0.89, 9.23 +/- 1.48 and 2.61 +/- 0.47mm/event, respectively. The statistical evaluation of the model's performance showed an unsatisfactory performance of the WEPP model for predicting the run-offs in the study area. This may be caused by the structural flaws in the model, and/or the insufficient site-specific input parameters. So, to achieve good performance and reliable results of the WEPP model, more observation data is required from different ecosystems in Syria. These findings can provide guidance to planners and environmental engineers for proposing environmental protection and water resources management plans in the Coastal Region in Syria.

M.; Yu, Qiang			Integrating machine learning and environmental variables to constrain uncertainty in crop yield change projections under climate change	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												Robust crop yield projections under future climates are fundamental prerequisites for reliable policy formation. Both process-based crop models and statistical models are commonly used for this purpose. Process-based models tend to simplify processes, minimize the effects of extreme events, and ignore biotic pressures, while statistical models cannot deterministically capture intricate biological and physiological processes underpinning crop growth. We attempted to integrate and overcome shortcomings in both modelling frameworks by integrating the dynamic linear model (DLM) and random forest machine learning model (RF) with nine global gridded crop models (GGCM), respectively, in order to improve projections and reduce uncertainties of maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merrill) yield projections. Our results demonstrated substantial improvements in model performance accuracy by using RF in concert with GGCM across China's maize and soybean belt. This improvement surpasses that achieved using DLM. For maize, the GGCM+RF models increased the r values from 0.15 to 0.61-0.64-0.77 and decreased nRMSE from approximately 0.20 to 0.50-0.13-0.17 compared with using GGCM alone. For soybean, the models increased r from 0.37 to 0.70-0.54-0.70 and decreased nRMSE from 0.17 to 0.35-0.17-0.20 compared with using GGCM alone. The main factors influencing maize yield changes included chilling days (CD), crop pests and diseases (CPDs), and drought, while for soybean the primary influencing factors included CPD, tropical days (based on exceeding a maximum temperature), and drought. Our approach decreased uncertainties by 33-78% for maize and by 56-68% for soybean. The main source of uncertainty for GGCM was the crop model. For GGCM+RF, the main source of uncertainty for the 2040-2069 period was the global climate model, while the main source of uncertainty for the 2070-2099 period was the climate scenario. Our results provide a novel, robust, and pragmatic framework to constrain uncertainties in order to accurately assess the impact of future climate change on crop yields. These results could be used to interpret future ensemble studies by accounting for uncertainty in crop and climate models, as well as to assess future emissions scenarios.

Traits mediate drought effects on wood carbon fluxes	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												CO2 fluxes from wood decomposition represent an important source of carbon from forest ecosystems to the atmosphere, which are determined by both wood traits and climate influencing the metabolic rates of decomposers. Previous studies have quantified the effects of moisture and temperature on wood decomposition, but these effects were not separated from the potential influence of wood traits. Indeed, it is not well understood how traits and climate interact to influence wood CO2 fluxes. Here, we examined the responses of CO2 fluxes from dead wood with different traits (angiosperm and gymnosperm) to 0%, 35%, and 70% rainfall reduction across seasonal temperature gradients. Our results showed that drought significantly decreased wood CO2 fluxes, but its effects varied with both taxonomical group and drought intensity. Drought-induced reduction in wood CO2 fluxes was larger in angiosperms than gymnosperms for the 35% rainfall reduction treatment, but there was no significant difference between these groups for the 70% reduction treatment. This is because wood nitrogen density and carbon quality were significantly higher in angiosperms than gymnosperms, yielding a higher moisture sensitivity of wood decomposition. These findings were demonstrated by a significant positive interaction effect between wood nitrogen and moisture on CO2 fluxes in a structural equation model. Additionally, we ascertained that a constant temperature sensitivity of CO2 fluxes was independent of wood traits and consistent with previous estimates for extracellular enzyme kinetics. Our results highlight the key role of wood traits in regulating drought responses of wood carbon fluxes. Given that both climate and forest management might extensively modify taxonomic compositions in the future, it is critical for carbon cycle models to account for such interactions between wood traits and climate in driving dynamics of wood decomposition.

We examined how P-sufficient 6-week-old soil-grown Trifolium subterraneum plants, and 2-week-old seedlings in solution culture, accumulated P in roots after inorganic P (Pi) addition. In contrast to our expectation that vacuoles would accumulate excess P, after 7 days, X-ray microanalysis showed that vacuolar [P] remained low (<12 mmol kg(-1)). However, in the plants after P addition, some cortex cells contained globular structures extraordinarily rich in P (often >3,000 mmol kg(-1)), potassium, magnesium, and sodium. Similar structures were evident in seedlings, both before and after P addition, with their [P] increasing threefold after P addition. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy showed seedling roots accumulated Pi following P addition, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed large plastids. For seedlings, we demonstrated that roots differentially expressed genes after P addition using RNAseq mapped to the T. subterraneum reference genome assembly and transcriptome profiles. Among the most up-regulated genes after 4 hr was TSub_g9430.t1, which is similar to plastid envelope Pi transporters (PHT4;1, PHT4;4): expression of vacuolar Pi-transporter homologs did not change. We suggest that subcellular P accumulation in globular structures, which may include plastids, aids cytosolic Pi homeostasis under high-P availability.

Our objectives in this study were to develop RZ-SHAW to include a new plastic module, and to evaluate the model's performance over three years of maize (Zea mays L.) production in China. A new plastic module was added to compute changes in the shortwave and longwave radiation transfer, turbulent heat and vapor transfer from the surface, and the energy and water balances in the system associated with a plastic mulch layer. The modified RZ-SHAW model can adequately simulate soil water (0.017 cm(3) cm(-3) <= RMSE <= 0.030 cm(3) cm(3)) and capture the evaporation reduction and transpiration increase under plastic mulch. The model over-estimated the increased soil temperatures under plastic mulch (2.3. over the 100-cm profile) compared to the measured data (1.4.). Overall, the revised RZ-SHAW model adequately simulated soil water and heat exchange under plastic mulch conditions. The modified RZ-SHAW model can be used as an effective decision tool for management optimization in plastic mulched cropland.

Carbon allocation plays an important role in forest carbon cycling and reflects forest adaptation to changing en-vironmental conditions. However, carbon allocation to RA(soil) has not been fully examined at the global scale. To fill this knowledge gap, we first used a Random Forest algorithm to predict the spatio-temporal patterns of RA(soil) from 1981 to 2017 based on the most updated Global Soil Respiration Database (v5) with global environmental variables; calculated carbon allocation from photosynthesis to RA(soil) (CA(B)) as a fraction of gross primary produc-tion; and assessed its temporal and spatial patterns in global forest ecosystems. Globally, mean RA(soil) from forests was 8.9 +/- 0.08 Pg C yr(-1) (mean +/- standard deviation) from 1981 to 2017 and increased significantly at a rate of 0.006 Pg C yr(-2), paralleling broader soil respiration changes and suggesting increasing carbon respired by roots. Mean CA(B) was 0.243 +/- 0.016 and decreased over time. The temporal trend of CA(B) varied greatly in space, reflecting uneven responses of CAR to environmental changes. Combined with carbon use efficiency, our CA(B) results offer a completely independent approach to quantify global aboveground autotropic respiration spatially and temporally, and could provide crucial insights into carbon flux partitioning and global carbon cycling under climate change.

Evidence has shown that climate change exacerbates the situation and presents a daunting challenge to predominantly rain-fed agricultural livelihoods. The aim of this study was to analyze the extent and sources of smallholder famers' livelihood vulnerability to climate change/variability in the Upper Blue Nile basin. We conducted a household survey (n = 391) across three distinct agroecological communities and a formative composite index of livelihood vulnerability (LVI) was constructed. The Mann-Kendall test and the standard precipitation index (SPI) were employed to analyze trends of rainfall, temperature, and drought prevalence for the period from 1982 to 2016. The communities across watersheds showed a relative difference in the overall livelihood vulnerability index. Aba Gerima (midland) was found to be more vulnerable, with a score of 0.37, while Guder (highland) had a relatively lower LVI with a 0.34 index score. Given similar exposure to climate variability and drought episodes, communities' livelihood vulnerability was mainly attributed to their low adaptive capacity and higher sensitivity indicators.

However, there is limited understanding regarding the temporal responses and underlying factors influencing ecosystem C stocks following grazing exclusion. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive synthesis of data from 199 independent experiments (454 pairwise observations) to analyze responses of plant and soil C stocks to grazing exclusion across four distinct grassland ecosystems (desert, typical, meadow, and alpine) in the globe. We found that rates of change in plant biomass C stocks and soil organic C stocks exponentially or rationally decreased with years since enclosure. Grazing exclusion generally enhanced aboveground biomass C in plants, while its effects on C stocks of belowground biomass and soil were more contingent upon various factors, such as climate, initial levels of C stocks, and grazing exclusion duration. Furthermore, the responses of C stocks of plant biomass and soil to livestock grazing cessation tend to stabilize over time, with equilibrium typically reaching after approximately 40 years, while soil C sequestration responses exhibited a lagged pattern compared to plant biomass C. Our results underscored the effectiveness of grazing exclusion as an effective strategy to enhance C stocks in regions characterized by low C content and non-water limited conditions. We propose that grazing exclusion for 1-5 years was the best restoration time for typical, meadow and alpine grasslands. Given the limited effects of grazing exclusion on soil organic C stocks of desert types, grazing exclusion might not be an effective measure to increase the soil organic C stocks in water-limited areas like desert grasslands.

For the small watershed with high management in this area, the scientific problem that has been paid attention to in recent years is the impact of the land consolidation project on the erosion environment in the gully region. In this study, the 3D simulation method of vegetation, eroded sediment and pollutant transport was innovated based on the principles of erosion sediment dynamics and similarity theory, and the impacts of GLCP were analyzed on the erosion environment at different scales. The verification results show that the design method and the scale conversion relationship (geometric scale: lambda(l) = 100) were reasonable and could simulate the transport process on the complex underlying surface of a small watershed. Compared with untreated watersheds, a significant change was the current flood peak lagging behind the sediment peak. There were two important critical values of GLCP impact on the erosion environment. The erosion transport in HMSW had no change when the proportion was less than 0.85%, and increased obviously when it was greater than 3.3%. The above results have important theoretical and practical significance for watershed simulation and land-use management in HMSW.					wang, zhiwen/JDV-9990-2023; Yuan, Fang/JQV-7426-2023; 王, 娅冰/JGE-0541-2023; XIE, WANYING/JNR-9259-2023; WANG, JIAXUAN/JMP-8599-2023; wen, liang/JNR-7720-2023; Liu, Gang/I-8858-2019	Liu, Gang/0000-0002-3444-3649														2073-4441				JUN	2021	13	11							1540	10.3390/w13111540	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13111540													WOS:000660834500001

However, the dominant factors of vegetation distribution showed greatly spatiotemporal variation, especially the alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau, which is known as an amplifier of climate warming. In this study, to identify the dominant factors of vegetation distribution, we verified the reliability and accuracy of the classification of alpine steppe and alpine meadow by Random Forest and tried to provide a new reference for the classification schemes. Dataset collected from the field investigations (200 sites) and previous publications(200 sites) were used in this study for model calibration and validation. Then climate models of CMIP6 were used to forecast the underlying transfers and changes of vegetation boundary in the future. Our results revealed that precipitation may be the dominant driver in the alpine grassland distribution, with the highest relative importance of 41.26%. Through different climate scenarios from 2000 to 2100, the vegetation boundary showed a shift from northeast to southwest. Within the SSP5-8.5 scenario it moves from 94.50 degrees to 93.49 degrees and shifted from north to south by 0.34 degrees. Our results demonstrated the significant role of precipitation in the alpine grassland distribution and revealed the migration of the alpine grassland ecosystem under different climate change scenarios. Our work may be useful to deal with global climate change, early warning, and grassland protection, as well as adaptive management of grassland.

THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS												Key message A novel wax locus GLOSSY1 was finely mapped to an approximately 308.1-kbp genomic interval on chromosome 2DS of wheat. The epicuticular wax, the outermost layer of aerial organs, gives plants their bluish-white (glaucous) appearance. Epicuticular wax is ubiquitous and provides an essential protective function against environmental stresses. In this study, we identified the glossy1 mutant on the basis of its glossy glume from an EMS population in the elite wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar Jimai22. The mutant had a dramatically different profile in total wax load and composition of individual wax constituents relative to the wild type, resulting in the increased cuticle permeability of glumes. The glossy glume phenotype was controlled by a single, semidominant locus mapping to the short arm of chromosome 2D, within a 308.1-kbp genomic interval that contained ten annotated protein-coding genes. These results pave the way for an in-depth analysis of the underlying genetic basis of wax formation patterns and enrich our understanding of mechanisms regulating wax metabolism.

However, the nutshell is frequently considered as a low-quality material. Further, its metabolic profile is still uncharacterized. In order to explore the industrial significance of the nutshell, this study performed metabolic and transcriptomic analyses at various developmental stages of the nutshell. The qualitative and quantitative metabolic data analysis identified 596 metabolic substances including several species of phenolic acids, flavonoids, lipids, organic acids, amino acids and derivatives, nucleotides and derivatives, alkaloids, lignans, coumarins, terpenoids, tannins, and others. However, phenolic acids and flavonoids were predominant, and their abundance levels were significantly altered across various developmental stages of the nutshell. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression patterns of phenolic acid and flavonoid pathway related genes were significantly changed during the nutshell growth. In particular, the expression of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, C4H, 4CL, CHS, CHI, F3H, and FLS had dynamic differences at the various developmental stages of the nutshell. Our integrative metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses identified the key metabolic substances and their abundance levels. We further discussed the regulatory mechanism of phenolic and flavonoid biosynthesis in the nutshell of M. ternifolia. Our results provide new insights into the biological profiles of the nutshell of M. ternifolia and help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of phenolic and flavonoid biosynthesis in the nutshell of M. ternifolia.																				1664-8021				FEB 21	2022	12								809986	10.3389/fgene.2021.809986	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.809986								35265099					WOS:000766941400001

These groups can be classified as always rare (ART), conditionally rare (CRT), dominant, and total taxa, each affecting ecosystem function in distinct ways. Thus, understanding the functional traits of organisms within these taxa is crucial for comprehending their contributions to overall ecosystem function. In our study, we investigated the influence of climate warming on the biogeochemical cycles of the ecosystem in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, utilizing an open top chamber experiment. Simulated warming significantly lowered ecosystem function in the grassland but not in the shrubland. This discrepancy was due to the diverse responses of the various taxa present in each ecosystem to warming conditions and their differing roles in determining and regulating ecosystem function. The microbial maintenance of ecosystem function was primarily reliant on the diversity of bacterial dominant taxa and CRT and was less dependent on ART and fungal taxa. Furthermore, bacterial CRT and dominant taxa of the grassland ecosystem were more sensitive to changing climatic conditions than grassland ART, resulting in a more pronounced negative diversity response. In conclusion, the biological maintenance of ecosystem function during climate warming is dependent on microbiome composition and the functional and response characteristics of the taxapresent. Thus, understanding the functional traits and response characteristics of various taxa is crucial for predicting the effects of climate change on ecosystem function and informing ecological reconstruction efforts in alpine regions of the plateau.

However, it remains unclear how animal grazing or its intensity affect nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and the main driving factors. A grazing experiment including four grazing intensities (G0, G0.7, G1.2, G1.6 yak ha(-1)) was conducted between January 2013 and December 2014 to evaluate the soil nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes under different grazing intensities in an alpine meadow on the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China. The N2O fluxes were examined with gas collected by the static chamber method and by chromatographic concentration analysis. N2O emissions in the growing seasons (from May to September) were lower than that in non-growing seasons (from October to April) in 2013, 1.94 +/- 0.30 to 3.37 +/- 0.56 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1). Annual mean N2O emission rates were calculated as 1.17 +/- 0.50 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1) in non-grazing land (G0) and 1.94 +/- 0.23 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1) in the grazing land (G0.7, G1.2, and G1.6). The annual mean N2O flux showed no significant differences between grazing treatments in 2013. However, there were significantly greater fluxes from the G0.7 treatment than from the G1.6 treatment in 2014, especially in the growing season. Over the two years, the soil N2O emission rate was significantly negatively correlated with soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content as well as positively correlated with soil available phosphorus (P). No relationship was observed between soil N2O emission rate and temperature or rainfall. Our results showed that the meadow soils acted as a source of N2O for most periods and turned into a weak sink of N2O later during the sampling period. Our results highlight the importance of proper grazing intensity in reducing N2O emissions from alpine meadow. The interaction between grazing intensity and N2O emissions should be of more concern during future management of pastures in Zoige Plateau.

However, the contents and distributions of these elements in deep soils and sediments are largely underestimated. We aimed to estimate the stocks, patterns, and driving factors of deep soil C and N on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) after large-scale ecological restoration projects. Materials and methods Soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) contents in different soil layers were measured directly at 86 sites along a regional transect across the CLP. Results and discussion SOC and TN contents ranged from 1.97 to 6.83 g C kg(-1) and 0.24 to 0.72 g N kg(-1), respectively, as the soil depth varied from 0 to 5 m. The mean contents and degrees of variability of SOC and TN decreased with the increasing of soil depth. Based on SOC and TN content patterns, we divided the 0-5-m soil profile into layers of 0-0.1, 0.1-0.4, 0.4-1, and 1-5 m. In the 1-5-m soil layer, approximately 70% of the mean SOC stock (14.97 kg C m(-2)) and 71% of the mean TN stock (1.75 kg N m(-2)) were stored. A partial least square regression model showed satisfactory predictive performance, with R-2 and Q(2) > 0.5 for SOC and TN stocks in the 0.1-0.4-m soil layer. Climatic factors, soil water content (SWC), and field capacity strongly affected SOC and TN stocks in all soil layers. The significance of clay content, SWC, and normalized difference vegetation index varied with soil depth and became the strongest in the 1-5-m soil layer. The highest proportion of SOC and TN stocks for this soil layer were found in grassland and in 450-550 mm rainfall zone. Conclusion Considerable amounts of SOC and TN stocks were stored in the 1-5-m-deep soils. Land-use types and rainfall zones can significantly affect the SOC and TN stocks. This information is helpful for identifying local land uses associated with high SOC and TN stocks and is essential for accurately estimating and predicting regional C and N stocks and cycles in terrestrial ecosystems.

The aim of this study was to investigate the storage, spatial patterns, and influencing factors of SOC in frozen ground on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which known as the earth's Third Pole.Materials and methodsUsing the observed edaphic data from China's Second National Soil Survey, we estimated the SOC storage (SOCS) of frozen ground (including permafrost, seasonally, and short time frozen ground) on the plateau with a depth of 0-3m. Furthermore, the effect of vegetation and climate factors on spatial variance of SOC density (SOCD) was analyzed.Results and discussionThe SOCD decreased from the southeastern to the northwestern part of the plateau, and increased with shorten of freezing duration. SOCS of permafrost, seasonally, and short time frozen ground were calculated as 40.9 (34.2-47.6), 26.7 (24.1-29.4), and 6 (5.6-6.4)Pg, making a total of 73.6 (63.9-83.3)Pg in 0-3m depth on the plateau. Normalized difference vegetation index and mean annual precipitation could significantly affect the spatial distribution of SOC in permafrost and seasonally frozen ground.ConclusionsThe soil in plateau frozen ground contained substantial organic carbon, which could be affected by plant and climate variables. However, the heterogeneous landform may make the fate of carbon more complicated in the future.

Understanding energy partitioning and evapotranspiration can reveal land-atmosphere interaction processes. We investigated energy fluxes, evapotranspiration, and their related biophysical factors using eddy covariance techniques in a black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) plantation in 2016, 2018, and 2019 on the Yellow River Delta. Downward longwave radiation offsets 84-85% of upward longwave radiation; upward shortwave radiation accounted for 12-13% of downward shortwave radiation. The ratio of net radiation to downward radiation was 18-19% over the three years. During the growing season, latent heat flux was the largest component of net radiation; during the dormant season, the sensible heat flux was the dominant component of net radiation. The seasonal variation in daily evapotranspiration was mainly controlled by net radiation, air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and leaf area index. Black locust phenology influenced daily evapotranspiration variations, and evapotranspiration was greater under sea winds than under land winds because soil water content at 10-cm depth was greater under sea winds during the day. Seasonal patterns of daily evaporative fraction, Bowen ratio, crop coefficient, Priestley-Taylor coefficient, surface conductance, and decoupling coefficient were mainly controlled by leaf area index. The threshold value of daily surface conductance was approximately 8 mm s(-1) over the plantation.					zhang, weijie/JQX-1450-2023; yang, qing/JBR-8440-2023; Wang, Xiaogang/B-2439-2013	Wang, Xiaogang/0000-0002-7929-5889													1007-662X	1993-0607				AUG	2022	33	4					1219	1232		10.1007/s11676-021-01376-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-021-01376-y		OCT 2021											WOS:000712237400002

Water use efficiency (WUE) has proven to be a crucial metric to quantify the trade-off linking global carbon and water cycles in many aspects of terrestrial ecosystem function. Investigating the response of ecosystem WUE to multiannual precipitation fluctuations has major implications for our understanding of ecosystem carbon and water dynamics. However, the impacts of water availability variation on evapotranspiration- and transpiration-based ecosystem WUE and their mechanisms are poorly understood due to limited observations. We investigated ecosystem WUE in response to interannual precipitation fluctuations in order to reveal the regularity underlying WUE changes under different levels of water stress. We optimized the parameters of two remote sensing models (PT-JPL and PM) based on different biophysical processes using the differential-evolution Markov Chain (DE-MC) method. We investigated ecosystem WUEET (GPP/ET) and WUET (GPP/T) in response to interannual precipitation fluctuations at 73 sites. We found ecosystem WUET appears to decline during drought years and to increase in wet years contrasting with WUEET, which was mostly attributable to differing sensitivities of GPP, ET and T to multiannual precipitation fluctuations. The vegetation generally consumes more T to improve ecosystem GPP during dry years, meanwhile, no apparent change in WUEET during dry years because of the trade of between GPP/T and T/ET. The replenishment of soil moisture to ecosystem transpiration is higher than we thought during dry years.

However, the effects of long-term active restoration of extremely degraded grassland on soil parameters have been equivocal. The aims of this study were to evaluate the impact of active restoration of degraded alpine grassland on: (a) soil organic matter (SOM) mineralization; and (b) the importance of biotic factors for temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of SOM mineralization. Soils were sampled from intact, degraded and restored alpine grasslands at altitudes ranging between 3,900 and 4,200 m on the Tibetan Plateau. The samples were incubated at 5, 15 and 25 degrees C, andQ(10)values of SOM mineralization were determined. Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the importance of vegetation, soil physico-chemical properties and microbial parameters forQ(10)regulation. TheQ(10)of N mineralization was similar among intact, degraded and restored soils (0.84-1.24) and was higher in topsoil (1.09) than in subsoil (0.92). The best predictive factor of CO2-Q(10)for intact grassland was microbial biomass, for degraded grassland was basal microbial respiration, and for restored grassland was soil bulk density. Restoration by planting vegetation decreased theQ(10)of SOM mineralization as soil bulk density, the most important negative predictor, increased in restored grassland. TheQ(10)of SOM mineralization in topsoil was 14% higher than in subsoil because of higher microbial abundance and exo-enzyme activities. The NH(4)(+)content was greatest in intact soil, while NO(3)(-)content was greatest in degraded soil. The SOM mineralization rate decreased with grassland degradation and increased after long-term (>10 years) restoration. In conclusion, extremely degraded grassland needs proper long-term management in active restoration projects, especially for improvement of soil nutrients in a harsh environment.

A case study from Xishuangbanna, southwest China	SILVA FENNICA												Despite the influence of cavities on the survival and distribution of cavity-dependent fauna, the variation in the density and characteristics of tree cavities across different habitat types in tropical forests is unknown. In this study, we surveyed 26 312 living trees from 376 species and compared cavity density and characteristics (height, size, type, and orientation) across five habitat types (valley, low-slope, high-slope, high-gully, and high-plateau) in a 20-hectare tropical rainforest in southwest China. From a total of 2047 cavities, we found that cavity density was mainly driven by habitat rather than tree species richness or diameter at breast height (DBH), and the characteristics of cavities were not uniformly distributed across habitats. Cavities were significantly more abundant in high-and low-slope than high-plateau habitats. Compared with other habitats, more "butt hollow" cavity types were found in high-slope habitat and they occurred at a lower tree height, whereas more "crack" cavities were found in low-slope habitat and they had a narrower entrance diameter. Although the mean orientation of cavities faced towards the northeast, cavity orientation varied significantly across habitat types. Our results indicate that certain types of cavities are concentrated in specific habitat types, which can provide avenues for forest management and biodiversity conservation. We highlight the importance of habitat heterogeneity in providing resources for cavity nesters.

The rapid expansion of oil palm cultivation is seen as one of the major causes for deforestation emissions and threatens the conservation of rain forest and swamp areas and their associated ecosystem services in tropical areas. Given the importance of oil palm in oil production and its adverse environmental consequences, it is important to understand the physiological and phenological processes of oil palm and its impacts on the carbon, water and energy cycles. In most global vegetation models, oil palm is represented by generic plant functional types (PFTs) without specific representation of its morphological, physical and physiological traits. This would cause biases in the subsequent simulations. In this study, we introduced a new specific PFT for oil palm in the global land surface model ORCHIDEE-MICT (v8.4.2, Organising Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic Ecosystems-aMeliorated Interactions between Carbon and Temperature). The specific morphology, phenology and harvest process of oil palm were implemented, and the plant carbon allocation scheme was modified to support the growth of the branch and fruit component of each phytomer. A new age-specific parameterization scheme for photosynthesis, autotrophic respiration and carbon allocation was also developed for the oil palm PFT, based on observed physiology, and was calibrated by observations. The improved model generally reproduces the leaf area index, biomass density and fruit yield during the life cycle at 14 observation sites. Photosynthesis, carbon allocation and biomass components for oil palm also agree well with observations. This explicit representation of oil palm in a global land surface model offers a useful tool for understanding the ecological processes of oil palm growth and assessing the environmental impacts of oil palm plantations.

Identifying baseflow characteristics and influencing factors can facilitate the understanding of the water budget of catchments. In this study, a revised one parameter digital filter was used to separate baseflow from total daily streamflow in 18 mountainous catchments around the North China Plain (NCP). Nine baseflow signatures (BSs) including Baseflow Index (BFI), the five-distribution signature (with the representative percentiles Q(b1) Q(b33) Q(b50) Q(b66) Q(b99), respectively), and the three-dynamics signature (seasonality ratio, SR; concavity index, CI; and slope of the baseflow duration curve, S-BDC) were used to assess the baseflow hydrological behaviour (i.e., seasonality, stability, and sensitivity). Our findings showed (1) an apparent spatial pattern for most baseflow signatures (except for Q(b1)), but no particular temporal variation in the studied catchments, (2) that summer precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil texture, vegetation, and geomorphic factors (i.e., elevation and slope) were the main factors influencing the variation of baseflow, (3) that winter dominated baseflow was associated with the karst geological distribution, and (4) that Q(b50), Q(b66), Q(b99) and CI were good predictors to estimate the BFI (R-2 = 0.756). This study analysed the baseflow signature behaviour of mountainous catchments and provided insights into the hydrological processes related to baseflow.

Despite its importance, the microbial traits behind this process are largely undetermined. Knowledge of the role of these traits is integral to advance our understanding of how soil microbes regulate carbon (C) emissions in forests, which support the largest soil carbon stocks globally. Using metagenomic sequencing and C-13-glucose, we provide unprecedented evidence that microbial traits explain a unique portion of the variation in soil priming across forest biomes from tropical to cold temperature regions. We show that microbial functional profiles associated with the degradation of labile C, especially rapid simple sugar metabolism, drive soil priming in different forests. Genes involved in the degradation of lignin and aromatic compounds were negatively associated with priming effects in temperate forests, whereas the highest level of soil priming was associated with beta-glucosidase genes in tropical/subtropical forests. Moreover, we reconstructed, for the first time, 42 whole bacterial genomes associated with the soil priming effect and found that these organisms support important gene machinery involved in priming effect. Collectively, our work demonstrates the importance of microbial traits to explain soil priming across forest biomes and suggests that rapid carbon metabolism is responsible for priming effects in forests. This knowledge is important because it advances our understanding on the microbial mechanisms mediating soil-climate feedbacks at a continental scale.

Prediction of baseflow index (BFI), the ratio of baseflow to total streamflow, has a great significance in unravelling the baseflow characteristics for large scale trajectory. Therefore, this study compares BFI predictive performance derived from a new multilevel regression approach along with two other commonly used approaches: hydrological modelling (SIMHYD, a simplified version of the HYDROLOG model, and Xinanjiang model), and linear regression (traditional linear regression, and alternative traditional regression considers the second-order interaction). The multilevel regression approach does not only group the catchments into the four climate zones (arid, tropics, equiseasonal and winter rainfall), but also considers inter-catchment and interclimate zone variances. Likewise, calibration and two regionalisation techniques namely spatial proximity and integrated similarity are used to obtain the BFI from hydrological modelling approach. Correspondingly, the traditional linear regression technique estimates BFI establishing linear regressions between catchment attributes and four climate zones. Then, all the three approaches are evaluated against combined average estimation from four well-parameterised baseflow separation methods (Lyne-Hollick (LH), United Kingdom Institute of Hydrology (UKIH), Chapman-Maxwell (CM) and Eckhardt (ECK)) at 596 catchments across Australia for 1980-2012. The findings show that the multilevel regression has greatly improved the performance of BFI prediction in comparison to other methods. In particular, the two calibrated and regionalised hydrological models perform worst in predicting BFI with a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of - 8.44 and - 2.58 along with an absolute percent bias (PBIAS) of 81% and 146% (overestimation of baseflow), respectively. However, the traditional linear regression remains in intermediate position with the NSE of 0.57 and bias of 25. In addition, alternative traditional regression also shows very close proximity. In contrast, the multilevel regression approach shows the best performance with the NSE of 0.75 and bias of 19%. The study also demonstrates that the multilevel regression approach can improve BFI prediction, and shows potential for being used in the prediction of other hydrological signatures in large-scale.

Taoyuan, China, is famous worldwide as a special ecosite for ultrahigh rice yield. Climatological factors affecting this phenomenon have been identified, but the potential molecular processes and environmental mechanisms promoting ultrahigh yield remain mysteries. This study identifies soil biotic factors affecting ultrahigh yield, considering soil microbial community structure and metagenomic functions during four key rice growth stages, together with results from nitrogen enrichment experiments and rice root transcriptome analysis. Our results show that Taoyuan has more diverse bacterial taxa, less diverse fungal taxa, and a 10-fold-stronger connection among microbial taxa as well as a significantly higher proportion of nutrient transport functions than a regular site. Notably, our metagenomic analysis shows that Taoyuan contains more taxa with nitrogen metabolism functions and a higher abundance of genes involved in the nitrification process (e.g., hydroxylamine oxidoreductase and nitric oxide dioxygenase), promoting effective transformation of ammonium (NH4+) to nitrate (NO3-) in rice fields and stimulating high expression of nitrate transporters in rice roots, leading to ultrahigh yields. Our results indicate that soil microbiota contribute to ultrahigh rice yield in Taoyuan, and indicate that nitrogen metabolism functions could be one of the mechanism for the ultrahigh yield of rice.

However, a comprehensive and robust methodology for estimating the relevant GHG budgets and net mitigation of China's ecological restoration projects is still urgently to await development. Based on the methods from IPCC and statistical data of the management practices under the projects, we constructed a methodology for carbon accounting and determining net mitigation for ecological restoration projects in China (CANM-EP). GHG emissions generated from different processes and practices of the projects were included in the CANM-EP, and by this methodology, carbon sequestration, GHG balance changes induced by ecological response, on-site and off-site GHG emissions could be estimated. Therefore, the CANM-EP provides comprehensive methods to estimate the whole GHG budgets as well as the net mitigation of China's ecological restoration projects. The CANM-EP provides accounting methods for comprehensive processes and management practices under respective ecological restoration projects in China. The CANM-EP could simultaneously estimate carbon sequestration and GHG emissions of the projects. The CANM-EP indicates net carbon sequestration and net contribution of China's ecological restoration projects to climate change mitigation. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Little is known about how the fluxes of these three greenhouse gases, from managed and natural grasslands worldwide, have contributed to past climate change, or the roles of managed pastures versus natural grasslands. Here, global trends and regional patterns of the full greenhouse gas balance of grasslands are estimated for the period 1750 to 2012. A new spatially explicit land surface model is applied, to separate the direct effects of human activities from land management and the indirect effects from climate change, increasing CO2 and regional changes in nitrogen deposition. Direct human management activities are simulated to have caused grasslands to switch from a sink to a source of greenhouse gas, because of increased livestock numbers and accelerated conversion of natural lands to pasture. However, climate change drivers contributed a net carbon sink in soil organic matter, mainly from the increased productivity of grasslands due to increased CO2 and nitrogen deposition. The net radiative forcing of all grasslands is currently close to neutral, but has been increasing since the 1960s. Here, we show that the net global climate warming caused by managed grassland cancels the net climate cooling from carbon sinks in sparsely grazed and natural grasslands. In the face of future climate change and increased demand for livestock products, these findings highlight the need to use sustainable management to preserve and enhance soil carbon storage in grasslands and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from managed grasslands. Grasslands, and the livestock that live there, are dynamic sources and sinks of greenhouse gases, but what controls these fluxes remains poorly characterized. Here the authors show that on the global level, grasslands are climate neutral owing to the cancelling effects of managed vs. natural systems.

However, it is inadequately represented in most global land surface models due to limited understanding of its controls. Based on intensive field studies at four Amazonian evergreen forests, we propose a novel, quantitative representation of tropical forest leaf phenology, which links multiple environmental variables with the seasonality of new leaf production and old leaf litterfall. The new phenology simulates higher rates of leaf turnover (new leaves replacing old leaves) in dry seasons with more sunlight, which is then implemented in ORCHIDEE, together with recent findings of ontogeny-associated photosynthetic capacity, and is evaluated against ground-based measurements of leaf phenology (canopy leaf area index and litterfall), eddy covariance fluxes (photosynthesis and latent heat), and carbon allocations from field observations. Results show the periodical cycles of solar radiation and vapor pressure deficit are the two most important environmental variables that are empirically related to new leaf production and old leaf abscission in tropical evergreen forests. The model with new representation of leaf phenology captures the seasonality of canopy photosynthesis at three out of four sites, as well as the seasonality of litterfall, latent heat, and light use efficiency of photosynthesis at all tested sites, and improves the seasonality of carbon allocations to leaves, roots, and sapwoods. This study advances understanding of the environmental controls on tropical leaf phenology and offers an improved modeling tool for gridded simulations of interannual CO2 and water fluxes in the tropics.

Sensitivity of simulated soil water content, evapotranspiration, gross primary production and biomass to climate change factors in Euro-Mediterranean grasslands	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Grassland models often yield more uncertain outputs than arable crop models due to more complex interactions and the largely undocumented sensitivity of grassland models to environmental factors. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of single-factor changes in temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric [CO2] on simulated soil water content (SWC), actual evapotranspiration (ET), gross primary production (GPP) and yield biomass, and also to link the sensitivity analysis with experimental results. We employed an unprecedented multi-model framework consisting of seven grassland models at nine sites with different environmental characteristics in Europe and Israel, with two management options at three sites. For warming/cooling and wetting/ drying, models showed general consistency in the direction of SWC and ET changes, but less agreement regarding GPP and biomass changes. The simulated responses consistently revealed an overall positive effect of CO2 enrichment on GPP and biomass, while the direction of change differed for SWC and ET. Comparing with singlefactor experimental manipulations, SWC simulations slightly underestimated the observed effect of warming, while the overall mean model sensitivity for biomass (+7.5%) closely matched the mean response observed with 1-2 degrees C warming (+6.6%). The models exhibited lower sensitivity of SWC to wetting or drying compared to the experiments. The overall mean sensitivity of biomass to drying was -4.3%, contrasting with the mean experimental effect size of -9.6%, which proved to be more realistic than the mean wetting effect (+3.2%, against +38.9% in the field trials). The simulated sensitivity of SWC to CO2 enrichment was markedly underestimated, while the biomass response (+12.0%) closely matched the observations (+17.5%). Although the multi-model averaging did not manifestly improve the realism of the simulations, it ensured a realistic response in the direction of change to varying conditions. The results suggest a paradigm shift in grassland modelling meaning that the usual practice of model optimisation/validation needs to be complemented by a sensitivity analysis following the approach presented. The results also highlight the importance of model improvements, especially in terms of soil hydrology representation, a key environmental driver of grassland functioning.

Among them, the coupling and coordination relationship between vegetation and soil is the key to the smooth implementation of ecological restoration and the project of returning farmland to forest and grassland. However, people have neglected whether the choice of vegetation restoration method is suitable for the development of ecological environment in this region, and whether vegetation and soil coexist harmoniously. In this paper, the typical watersheds with similar terrain environment but different vegetation restoration methods were selected as the research objects, which were Dongzhuanggou (natural restoration, NR) and Yangjiagou (artificial restoration, AR). Through vegetation investigation and soil physical property experiment, the comprehensive evaluation function was used to quantify the impact of restoration methods on vegetation characteristics and soil properties, and the vegetation-soil coupling model was used to explore the coordinated development of vegetation and soil under different restoration methods. The results showed that there were significant differences between the two restoration methods in terms of vegetation characteristics (P < 0.05). The vegetation diversity indices of NR were 1.59-4.81 times that of AR. For root characteristic indices, NR was 1.05-2.25 times that of AR. For soil physical properties, there was no significant difference between the two restoration methods (P > 0.05). The comprehensive evaluation function of vegetation (VCE) and soil (SCE) under NR were 0.74 and 0.42, respectively, while those under AR were 0.55 and 0.63, respectively. The comprehensive function showed that the vegetation population performance under NR was slightly better than that under AR, while the soil restoration effect was opposite. Under the two restoration methods, the vegetation-soil coupling relationship was barely coordinated (NR: 0.53; AR: 0.54), and both were the intermediate coordinated development mode. The vegetation diversity, tending level and soil management level should be improved simultaneously during the process of vegetation restoration on the Chinese Loess Plateau.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				AUG 1	2023	884								163828	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163828	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163828		MAY 2023						37121322					WOS:000999540100001

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Droughts represent one of the most severe abiotic stress factors that could result in great crop yield loss. Numer-ous vegetation indices have been proposed for monitoring the vegetation condition under stress and assessing drought impacts on yield loss. However, the understanding and comparison between traditional vegetation indi-ces (VIs) and the newly emerging satellite Sun-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) for monitoring vegetation condition is still limited especially under drought stress and at multiple spatial scales. In this study, the potential of satellite observation SIF for monitoring corn response to drought was investigated based on the 2012 drought in the US Corn Belt. The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was used here to quantify drought. We found that all SPEI were above -1, except for July (-1.27), August (-1.39) and September (-1.14) in 2012, indicating the severity of this drought. We examined the relationship between satellite mea-surements of SIF, SIFyield, VIs (e.g., NDVI and EVI) and SPEI. Results indicated that SIFyield was sensitive to drought and SIF captured the stress more accurately both at the regional and state scales for the US Corn Belt. Quantita-tively, SIFyield had a high correlation with SPEI (r = 0.987, p < 0.05) over the entire Corn Belt, and it indicated losses in response to drought approximately one month earlier than SIF/NDVI/EVI. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that SIF could be trusted as an effective indicator to study the relationship between GPP (R-2 >= 0.8664, p < 0.01) under drought conditions across the Corn Belt. This study highlighted the advantage of using satellite SIF observations to monitor the drought stress on crop growth especially GPP at regional scale. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Fasting in the ureotelic Lake Magadi tilapia, <i>Alcolapia grahami</i>, does not reduce its high metabolic demand, increasing its vulnerability to siltation events	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY												Lake Magadi, Kenya, is one of the most extreme aquatic environments on Earth (pH similar to 10, anoxic to hyperoxic, high temperatures). Recently, increased water demand and siltation have threatened the viable hot springs near the margins of the lake where Alcolapia grahami, the only fish surviving in the lake, live. These Lake Magadi tilapia largely depend on nitrogen-rich cyanobacteria for food and are 100% ureotelic. Their exceptionally high aerobic metabolic rate, together with their emaciated appearance, suggests that they are energy-limited. Therefore, we hypothesized that during food deprivation, Magadi tilapia would economize their energy expenditure and reduce metabolic rate, aerobic performance and urea-N excretion. Surprisingly, during a 5-day fasting period, routine metabolic rates increased and swimming performance (critical swimming speed) was not affected. Urea-N excretion remained stable despite the lack of their N-rich food source. Their nitrogen use switched to endogenous sources as liver and muscle protein levels decreased after a 5-day fast, indicating proteolysis. Additionally, fish relied on carbohydrates with lowered muscle glycogen levels, but there were no signs indicating use of lipid stores. Gene expression of gill and gut urea transporters were transiently reduced as were gill rhesus glycoprotein Rhbg and Rhcg-2. The reduction in gill glutamine synthetase expression concomitant with the reduction in Rh glycoprotein gene expression indicates reduced nitrogen/ammonia metabolism, most likely decreased protein synthesis. Additionally, fish showed reduced plasma total CO2, osmolality and Na+ (but not Cl-) levels, possibly related to reduced drinking rates and metabolic acidosis. Our work shows that Lake Magadi tilapia have the capacity to survive short periods of starvation which could occur when siltation linked to flash floods covers their main food source, but their seemingly hardwired high metabolic rates would compromise long-term survival.

Currently, tools to assist decision -making are either dedicated to small-scale management guidance or large-scale assessment, which ignore the cross-scale linkages and interactions and thus may not provide robust and consistent guidance and assessment. Here, we developed an advanced agricultural modeling framework by integrating the strengths of conventional crop models in representing crop growth processes and management practices into a terrestrial biosphere model (TBM), the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM), to meet the cross-scale application needs (e.g., adaptation and mitigation). Specifically, dynamic crop growth processes, including crop-specific phenological development, carbon allocation, yield formation, biological nitrogen fixation processes, and management practices such as tillage, cover cropping and genetic improvements, were explicitly represented in DLEM. The new model was evaluated against site-scale observations and the results showed that the model performed generally well, with an average normalized root mean square error of 19.91% for leaf area index and 17.46% for aboveground biomass at the seasonal scale and 14.42% for annual yield. Then the model was applied to simulate corn, soy-bean, and winter wheat productions in the conterminous United States from 1960 to 2018. The spatial patterns of simulated crop productions were consistent with ground survey data. Our model also captured both the long-term trends and interannual variations of the total national productions of the three crops. This study demon-strates the significance of fusing conventional crop modeling techniques into TBMs to establish a unified modeling framework, which holds the potential to address climate impacts, adaptation and mitigation across varied spatiotemporal scales.

Thirty-six male yaks, aged 2-3 years, were divided into three groups and received a ME:N ratio of 0.42 (HY), 0.36 (MY,) or 0.32 (LY) MJ/g. Dry matter intake ranged between 3.16 and 3.63 kg/d and was lesser (p < 0.001) in the LY group than the other two groups. ME intake increased (p < 0.001) with an increase in the ME:N ratio, while N intake did not differ among groups. The ADG was 660 g/day for the MY group, which was higher (p < 0.005) than the 430 g/day in the LY group, while the HY group gained 560 g/day and did not differ from the other two groups. Feed intake to ADG ratio ranged between 5.95 and 7.95, and numerically was highest in the LY group and lowest in the MY group. In general, the concentration of ruminal total volatile fatty acids (p < 0.03) and molar proportions of propionate (p < 0.04), increased, while the molar proportion of acetate (p < 0.005) and the acetate:propionate ratio decreased (p < 0.001) with a decrease in the ME:N ratio. The molar proportion of butyrate did not differ among groups (p = 0.112). Group MY had higher ruminal NH3-N content than group HY and had a higher serum glucose content but lower urea content, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase content than group LY. In ruminal bacteria at the phylum level, the relative abundance of Firmicutes (F) was greater and of Bacteroidetes (B) was lesser, while the F:B ratio was greater in group MY than in groups HY an LY. We concluded that the yaks consuming the diet containing a ME:N ratio of 0.36 MJ/g had the best performance of the three groups.																				1664-302X				OCT 11	2022	13								1013980	10.3389/fmicb.2022.1013980	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.1013980								36304954					WOS:000874639600001

Based on this methodology, the annual variance and composition of carbon sequestration, GHG emissions and net carbon sequestration were analyzed for the first stage of the Beijing-Tianjin Sand Source Control Project (BTSSCP) (2001-2010) in the respective project provinces. The total carbon sequestration in the BTSSCP from 2001 to 2010 was 71.25-71.66 Tg C, and the additional GHG emissions from the BTSSCP were 7.28-7.50 Tg Ce, which counteracted 10.2-10.5% of the sequestered carbon. Among the different project measures in their corresponding ecosystems, the counteraction effect of grassland management in the grassland ecosystem was over 50%, which was much higher than that of afforestation and the conversion of cropland to forest. The net carbon sequestration in the BTSSCP was 63.75-64.38 Tg Ce, and the annual average was 6.38 -6.44 Tg Ce.yr(-1). The annual rate of net carbon mitigation for Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia was 1.16-1.17, 1.29-1.30, 1.06-1.07, 0.85-0.86 and 0.63-0.65 t Ce . ha(-1) . yr(-1), respectively. The GHG emissions offset a minor part of the carbon sequestration in the BTSSCP. Therefore, the BTSSCP makes a relatively significant contribution to GHG mitigation in China.

Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are essential elements limiting plant-microbial growth in forest ecosystems. However, whether the pattern of plant-microbe nutrient limitation is consistent across forest biomes and the associated potential mechanisms remain largely unclear, limiting us to better understand the biogeochemical processes under future climate change.2. Here, we investigated patterns of plant-microbial N/P limitation in forests across a wide environmental gradient and biomes in China to explore the divergence of plant-microbial N/P limitation and the driving mechanisms.3. We revealed that 42.6% of the N/P limitation between plant-microbial communities was disconnected. Patterns in plant-microbial N/P limitations were consistent only for 17.7% of N and 39.7% of P. Geospatially, the inconsistency was more evident at mid-latitudes, where plants were mainly N limited and microbes were mainly P limited. Furthermore, our findings were consistent with the ecological stoichiometry of plants and microbes themselves and their requirements. Whereas plant N and P limitation was more strongly responsive to meteorological conditions and atmospheric deposition, that of microbes was more strongly responsive to soil chemistry, which exacerbated the plant-microbe N and P limitation divergence.4.

This work presents the results of an interlaboratory study conducted between five laboratories from four countries. Carbon-based PSCs are prepared by screen printing, encapsulated, and sent to different laboratories across Europe to assess their stability by the application of three ISOS aging protocols: (a) in the dark (ISOS-D), (b) under simulated sunlight (ISOS-L), and (c) outdoors (ISOS-O). Over 1000 h stability is reported for devices in the dark, both at room temperature and at 65 degrees C. Under continuous illumination at open circuit, cells survive only for few hours, although they recover after being stored in the dark. Better stability is observed for cells biased at maximum power point under illumination. Finally, devices operate in outdoors for 30 days, with minor degradation, in two different locations (Barcelona, Spain and Paola, Malta). The findings demonstrate that open-circuit conditions are too severe for stability assessment and that the diurnal variation of the photovoltaic parameters reveals performance to be strongly limited by the fill factor, in the central hours of the day, due to the high series resistance of the carbon electrode.

Regional contributions to the interannual variation (IAV) of China's terrestrial carbon sink and the attributions to climate variations are not well understood. Here we have investigated how terrestrial ecosystems in the four climate zones with various climate variabilities contribute to the IAV in China's terrestrial net ecosystem productivity (NEP) using modeled carbon fluxes data from six ecosystems models. Model results show that the monsoonal region of China dominates national NEP IAV with a contribution of 86% (69%-96%) on average. Yearly national NEP changes are mostly driven by gross primary productivity IAV and half of the annual variation results from NEP changes in summer. Regional contributions to NEP IAV in China are consistent with their contributions to the magnitude of national NEP. Rainfall variability dominates the NEP annual variability in China. Precipitation in the temperate monsoon climate zone makes the largest contribution (23%) to the IAV of NEP in China because of both the high sensitivity of terrestrial ecosystem carbon uptake to rainfall and the large fluctuation in the precipitation caused by the East Asian summer monsoon anomalies. Our results suggest that NEP IAV can be mainly attributed to ecosystems with larger productivity and response to precipitation, and highlight the importance of monsoon climate systems with high seasonal and interannual variability in driving internannual variation in the land carbon sink.					wang, KiKi/JFZ-3334-2023; Ren, Xiao/HNS-0057-2023; li, yue/HSF-7296-2023; li, yueyue/IVH-9846-2023; Ge, Rong/AAK-5637-2021; LI, Yue/GRS-8071-2022; Liu, Zhiyu/JNR-8043-2023	Liu, Zhiyu/0000-0001-8351-1268; zhang, li/0000-0002-0423-5494; Yan, Huimin/0000-0003-0678-0397													1748-9326					JAN	2019	14	1							014003	10.1088/1748-9326/aaec95	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aaec95													WOS:000455056100003

L.			Pervasive decreases in living vegetation carbon turnover time across forest climate zones	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Forests play a major role in the global carbon cycle. Previous studies on the capacity of forests to sequester atmospheric CO2 have mostly focused on carbon uptake, but the roles of carbon turnover time and its spatiotemporal changes remain poorly understood. Here, we used long-term inventory data (1955 to 2018) from 695 mature forest plots to quantify temporal trends in living vegetation carbon turnover time across tropical, temperate, and cold climate zones, and compared plot data to 8 Earth system models (ESMs). Long-term plots consistently showed decreases in living vegetation carbon turnover time, likely driven by increased tree mortality across all major climate zones. Changes in living vegetation carbon turnover time were negatively correlated with CO2 enrichment in both forest plot data and ESM simulations. However, plot-based correlations between living vegetation carbon turnover time and climate drivers such as precipitation and temperature diverged from those of ESM simulations. Our analyses suggest that forest carbon sinks are likely to be constrained by a decrease in living vegetation carbon turnover time, and accurate projections of forest carbon sink dynamics will require an improved representation of tree mortality processes and their sensitivity to climate in ESMs.					Penuelas, Josep/D-9704-2011; Smith, William/HLW-4325-2023; Sardans, Jordi/AEM-0228-2022; Schaub, Marcus/E-4874-2012; Gessler, Arthur/C-7121-2008	Penuelas, Josep/0000-0002-7215-0150; Smith, William/0000-0002-5785-6489; Sardans, Jordi/0000-0003-2478-0219; Schaub, Marcus/0000-0002-0158-8892; Trugman, Anna/0000-0002-7903-9711; Zhu, Kai/0000-0003-1587-3317; Gessler, Arthur/0000-0002-1910-9589; Cailleret, Maxime/0000-0001-6561-1943													0027-8424					DEC 3	2019	116	49					24662	24667		10.1073/pnas.1821387116	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1821387116								31740604					WOS:000500804600044

However, previous studies on the spatial dynamics and transport mechanism of HMs have been profoundly limited by the field sampling issues, such as the uneven observations of individual carriers and their spatial mismatch, especially over large-scale catchments with complex environment. In this study, a novel methodological framework for mapping HMs at catchment scale was proposed and applied, combining a species distribution model (SDM) with physical environment and human variables. Based on the field observations, we ecologicalized HMs in different carriers as different species. This enabled the proposed framework to model the 'enrichment area' of individual HMs in the geographic space (termed as the HM 'habitat') and identify their 'hotspots' (peak value points) within the catchment. Results showed the output maps of HM habitats from secondary carriers (soil, sediment, and wet deposition) well agreed with the influence of industry contaminants, hydraulic sorting, and precipitation washout process respectively, indicating the potential of SDM in modeling the spatial distributions of the HM. The derived maps of HMs from secondary carriers, along with the human and environmental variables were then input as explanatory variables in SDM to predict the spatial patterns of the final HM accumulation in river water, which was observed to have largely improved the prediction quality. These results confirmed the value of our framework to leverage SDMs from ecology perspective to study HM contamination transport at catchment scale, offering new insights not only to map the spatial HM habitats but also help locate the HM transport chains among different carriers.

Yet our understanding of ecosystem fires and their carbon cycle consequences is still limited, largely due to the difficulty of large-scale fire monitoring and the complex interactions between fire, vegetation, climate, and anthropogenic factors. Here, using data from satellite-derived fire observations and ecosystem model simulations, we performed a comprehensive investigation of the spatial and temporal dynamics of China's ecosystem fire disturbances and their carbon emissions over the past two decades (1997-2016). Satellite-derived results showed that on average about 3.47 - 4.53 x 104 km(2) of the land was burned annually during the past two decades, among which annual burned forest area was about 0.81 - 1.25 x 104 km(2), accounting for 0.33-0.51% of the forest area in China. Biomass burning emitted about 23.02 TgC per year. Compared to satellite products, simulations from the Energy Exascale Earth System Land Model (ELM) strongly overestimated China's burned area and fire-induced carbon emissions. Annual burned area and fire-induced carbon emissions were high for boreal forest in Northeast China's Daxing'anling region and subtropical dry forest in South Yunnan, as revealed by both the satellite product and the model simulations. Our results suggest that climate and anthropogenic factors play critical roles in controlling the spatial and seasonal distribution of China's ecosystem fire disturbances. Our findings highlight the importance of multiple complementary approaches in assessing ecosystem fire disturbance and its carbon consequences. Further studies are required to improve the methods of observing and modelling China's ecosystem fire disturbances, which will provide valuable information for fire management and ecosystem sustainability in an era when both human activities and the natural environment are rapidly changing.

The FAO56 recommended Penman-Monteith (P-M) model is widely adopted as the standard method for ET0 estimation, but its application is usually restricted by limited meteorological data worldwide, especially global solar radiation (Rs). This study provided two possible solutions to deal with the missing Rs data in ET0 estimation in China mainland. In the first solution, Rs data were estimated with the & ANGS;ngstro & BULL;m-Prescott (A-P) formula and daily sunshine hours. The values of two A-P formula fundamental co-efficients a and b were obtained through three ways: (1) estimated based on limited Rs measurements at 80 solar radiation measurement stations (or site-calibrated); (2) recommended by the FAO-56 manual (or FAO-recommended); and (3) estimated based on the altitude and latitude of each weather station through the sup-port vector machine algorithm (or SVM-estimated). The second solution used the SVM algorithm and available weather variables without Rs. The results showed that the FAO-recommended coefficients a and b were sepa-rately overestimated and underestimated in China mainland, which generated the largest simulation errors of Rs. However, the transfer errors from Rs estimations to ET0 estimations were reduced by using the P-M model for all of the three kinds of coefficients. Compared with the Rs-based models, the estimation accuracy of the SVM-ET0 model yielded the highest accuracy both at the training stage (R2 = 0.979; RMSE = 0.273 mm d-1) and the testing stage (R2 = 0.973; RMSE = 0.302 mm d-1). Generally, both the P-M and the machine-learning-based methods could be used for the ET0 estimation, when only Rs data were missing. However, considering the complexity in the programming, the P-M model combining with the A-P formula with the SVM-estimated A-P coefficients is recommended for daily ET0 estimation in China.

Despite its widespread application to a broad range of research topics, it remains unclear how synthesis has affected the discipline. Using a case study of publications (n = 2304) from the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis compared with papers with similar keywords from the Web of Science (n = 320,000), we address several questions about the comparative impact of synthesis, the role of synthesis in driving key research themes, and whether synthesis is focused on different topics than is the broader ecological literature. We found much higher citation rates for synthesis papers overall (fivefold more) and within eleven key topic themes (e.g., species richness, biodiversity, climate change, global change). Synthesis papers often played key roles in driving, redirecting, or resolving core questions and exhibited much greater cross-theme connectivity. Together, these results indicate that synthesis in science has played a crucial role in accelerating and advancing ecological knowledge.

As a cool season crop, wheat (Triticum aestivum) is sensitive to HS-induced damages. To support the genetic improvement of wheat HS tolerance (HST), we conducted fine mapping of TaHST1, a locus required for maintaining wheat vegetative and reproductive growth under elevated temperatures. TaHST1 was mapped to the distal terminus of 4AL chromosome arm using genetic populations derived from two BC6F6 breeding lines showing tolerance (E6015-4T) or sensitivity (E6015-3S) to HS. The 4AL region carrying TaHST1 locus was approximately 0.949 Mbp and contained the last 19 high confidence genes of 4AL according to wheat reference genome sequence. Resequencing of E6015-3S and E6015-4T and haplotype analysis of 3087 worldwide wheat accessions revealed heightened deletion polymorphisms in the distal 0.949 Mbp region of 4AL, which was confirmed by the finding of frequent gene losses in this region in eight genome-sequenced hexaploid wheat cultivars. The great majority (86.36%) of the 3087 lines displayed different degrees of nucleotide sequence deletions, with only 13.64% of them resembling E6015-4T in this region. These deletions can impair the presence and/or function of TaHST1 and surrounding genes, thus rendering global wheat germplasm vulnerable to HS or other environmental adversities. Therefore, conscientious and urgent efforts are needed in global wheat breeding programmes to optimize the structure and function of 4AL distal terminus by ensuring the presence of TaHST1 and surrounding genes. The new information reported here will help to accelerate the ongoing global efforts in improving wheat HST.

Though China's vegetation biomass in recent decades has been widely investigated, only two studies have quantitatively assessed its century-scale changes so far and reported totally opposite trends. This study provided the first multi-model estimates of China's vegetation biomass change for the 20th century and its responses to historical changes in environmental and anthropogenic factors, based on simulations evaluated with the field observations from 3757 inventory plots in China and bias-corrected using machine learning (Gaussian process regression). A significant decline in vegetation biomass over the 20th century was shown by bias-corrected simulations from the six Dynamic Global Vegetation models (DGVMs) with trends ranging from -32.48 to -11.10 Tg C yr(-1)and a mean trend of -17.74 Tg C yr(-1). Land use and land cover change (LULCC) was primarily responsible for the simulated downward trend (-50.71 to -24.28 Tg C yr(-1)), while increasing atmospheric CO(2)concentration lead to increased vegetation biomass (+9.27 to + 13.37 Tg C yr(-1)). Climate change had limited impacts on the long-term trend (-3.75 to + 5.06 Tg C yr(-1)). This study highlights the importance of LULCC for historical reconstruction and future projection of vegetation biomass over China. It also suggests that the incorrect change in China's forest area for 1980-2000 in the LULCC dataset used as model input data of many existing and ongoing model intercomparison projects (MIPs) has likely led to inaccurate estimations of historical vegetation biomass changes in China.

Unfortunately, such climatic risks remained largely unexplored due to the complexity in future climate predictions, uncertainties in apple phenological simulations, and difficulties in quantifications of risks of late-spring frost and poor pollination. Here, focusing on the main apple production Sub-regions I-IV (i.e., the Loess Plateau, the Bohai Bay, the Southwest Cool Highland, and Xinjiang) in China, we used an ensemble of seven phenological models to estimate changes in apple first flowering and fruit-setting. Based on phenological sensitivity window proposed, we evaluated the late-spring frost risk and climatic risk of poor pollination based on two individual indices developed for these two kinds of meteorological risks. The phenology model ensemble was driven by climatic data derived from an ensemble of 27 global climate models (GCMs) from CMIP6 to simulate apple phenology in two periods of 2021 -2060 (Near Future) and 2061 -2100 (Far Future) under two climate scenarios of SSP245 and SSP585. Model ensemble could largely improve phenology prediction accuracy. Our results also confirmed the general earlier occurrence of apple phenological stages and the shortening of phenological sensitive windows. The first flowering advanced about 0.19 -0.32 d & BULL;y-1 and fruit-setting advanced about 0.24 -0.47 d & BULL;y-1. Although the shortening of phenological sensitivity window might decrease frost frequency in some regions and reduce the general risk of late-spring frost (e.g. in Sub-region II), the increase of frost intensity could offset this kind of alleviation and even exacerbate frost risks in Sub-regions I and IV. Finally, except for Sub-region III and a few sites in Sub-regions I and IV, shifts in climatic risks of poor pollination in spatial contrasts were lower than late-spring frost risk. This highlighted late-spring frosts would be more possibly the reason for apple yield or quality losses than the un-favorable climatic pollination conditions under climate change. Model ensemble provides a realistic assessment for quantifying future risks of late spring frost and poor pollination in apple production systems, and helps to identify urgent meteorological risks and provide options for apple production systems in response to climate change.																			1161-0301	1873-7331				OCT	2023	150								126945	10.1016/j.eja.2023.126945	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2023.126945		AUG 2023											WOS:001062641700001

Recently the combination of crop models (CMs), global climate models (GCMs), and species distribution models (SDMs) has been applied to assess the impacts of climate change on crop production with consideration of changes of crop climate-suitable regions. However, little is known about the uncertainty sources in the wheat production projections with consideration of crop climatic suitability under future climate. In this study, an integration method based on multiple CMs, SDMs, and GCMs was adopted to assess the impacts of climate change on winter wheat production in the Loess Plateau of China. A comprehensive analysis of different uncertainty sources (i.e. CM, GCM, SDM, Emission Scenario or Scen, and their interactions) was conducted through the ANOVA (Analysis of variance) method. Based on the projections of CM ensemble and ensemble-SDMs driven by 27 GCMs, multi-model mean winter wheat production would increase by 14.6% and 19.7% in 2041-2060 and 4.9% and 3.5% in 2081-2100 under SSP245 and SSP585, respectively. We found that the changes in climate-suitable areas of winter wheat caused larger changes in winter wheat production than the changes of per unit yield. SDM was the largest uncertainty contributor among the four main factors of CM, GCM, SDM, and Scen in the projections of winter wheat production under future climate in the Loess Plateau, accounting for about 20.3% of total uncertainty. At the same time, CM was the lowest uncertainty contributor and accounted for only about 3.0% of total uncertainty. Thus, CM was proved more certain in future projections of winter wheat production when considering the changes of crop climate-suitable areas. The efforts in this study could help to rationally integrate the crop modeling, species distribution modeling, and climate models on the projections of global wheat production under future global climate change.

However, the annual C accumulation rates contributing to the C storage in these systems have yet to be spatially estimated on a large scale. We synthesized C accumulation rate (CAR) in tidal wetlands of the conterminous United States (US), upscaled the CAR to national scale, and predicted trends based on climate change scenarios. Here, we show that the mean CAR is 161.8 +/- 6 g Cm-2 yr(-1), and the conterminous US tidal wetlands sequestrate 4.2-5.0 Tg C yr(-1). Relative sea level rise (RSLR) largely regulates the CAR. The tidal wetland CAR is projected to increase in this century and continue their C sequestration capacity in all climate change scenarios, suggesting a strong resilience to sea level rise. These results serve as a baseline assessment of C accumulation in tidal wetlands of US, and indicate a significant C sink throughout this century.

Inter-Basin Transfers Extend the Benefits of Water From Forests to Population Centers Across the Conterminous US	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Clean water from forests is commonly used to supply drinking water to communities both within and outside basin boundaries through inter-basin transfers (IBTs). Here, we modified the Water Supply Stress Index (WaSSI) model to provide estimates of mean water yield and the proportion of mean flow originating on forested lands at the 12-Digit Hydrologic Unit Code scale across the conterminous United States (CONUS). We accounted for the benefits of forests for drinking water supply and receiving populations through IBTs by incorporating a new IBT database, surface intake location information for public drinking water systems, and modeled water yield from forests. We compiled the new database of 594 IBTs ranging from 0.01 million m(3) yr(-1) to 8,900 million m(3) yr(-1), for a total transferred volume of 116,894 million m(3) yr(-1). According to our results, forested lands comprised 28.7% of the total land area across CONUS, but contributed 46% of the total surface water yield. Approximately 125.5 million people derived more than 10% of their surface drinking water supply from forested lands, and 83.1 million people received more than 50% of their surface drinking water supply from forested lands. Of those 83.1 million people receiving more than 50% of their surface drinking water supply from forested lands, 19.4 million people obtained some (>= 0.01%) of that water through IBTs. We conclude that accounting for IBTs is critical to accurately assess the contribution of forested watersheds for surface drinking water supply. Hydrologic models for assessment and decision making must include IBTs to fully account for the effects of climate change and human population dynamics on water resource availability at watershed to regional scales. Results from this study can aid water resource and forest managers in developing integrated watershed management plans at a time when climate change, population growth, and land use change threaten water supplies.

Variations in root system architecture (RSA) affect the functions of roots and thus play vital roles in plant adaptations and agricultural productivity. The aim of this study was to unravel the genetic relationship between RSA traits and shoot-related traits in soybean. This study characterized RSA variability at seedling stage in a recombinant inbred population, derived from a cross between cultivated soybean C08 and wild soybean W05, and performed high-resolution quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. In total, 34 and 41 QTLs were detected for RSA-related and shoot-related traits, respectively, constituting eight QTL clusters. Significant QTL correspondence was found between shoot biomass and RSA-related traits, consistent with significant correlations between these phenotypes. RSA-related QTLs also overlapped with selection regions in the genome, suggesting the cultivar RSA could be a partial consequence of domestication. Using reciprocal grafting, we confirmed that shoot-derived signals affected root development and the effects were controlled by multiple loci. Meanwhile, RSA-related QTLs were found to co-localize with four soybean flowering-time loci. Consistent with the phenotypes of the parental lines of our RI population, diminishing the function of flowering controlling E1 family through RNA interference (RNAi) led to reduced root growth. This implies that the flowering time-related genes within the RSA-related QTLs are actually contributing to RSA. To conclude, this study identified the QTLs that determine RSA through controlling root growth indirectly via regulating shoot functions, and discovered superior alleles from wild soybean that could be used to improve the root structure in existing soybean cultivars.

In addition to medical applications, CT has also been widely used in soil and plant science for visual and quanti-tative descriptions of physical, chemical, and biological properties and processes. The technique has been used successfully on numerous applications. However, with a rapidly evolving CT technologies and expanding ap-plications, a renewed review is desirable. Only a few attempts have been made to collate and review examples of CT applications involving the integrated field of soil and plant research in recent years. Therefore, the objectives of this work were to: (1) briefly introduce the basic principles of CT and image processing; (2) identify the research status and hot spots of CT using bibliometric analysis based on Web of Science literature over the past three decades; (3) provide an overall review of CT applications in soil science for measuring soil properties (e.g., porous soil structure, soil components, soil biology, heat transfer, water flow, and solute transport); and (4) give an overview of applications of CT in plant science to detect morphological structures, plant material properties, and root-soil interaction. Moreover, the limitations of CT and image processing are discussed and future per-spectives are given.

Although there exists a few national/global structure databases for natural forests, a country-wide synthetic structure database for plantation forests over China, the world's largest player in plantation forests, has not been achieved. In this study, we built a country-wide synthetic stand structure database by surveying more than 600 peer-reviewed literature. The database covers tree species, mean stand age, mean tree height, stand density, canopy coverage, diameter at breast height, as well as the associated ancillary in-situ topographical and soil properties. A total of 594 published studies concerning diverse forest stand structure parameters were compiled for 46 tree species. This first synthesis for stand structure of plantation forests over China supports studies on the evolution/ health of plantation forests in response to rapid climate change and intensified disturbances, and benefits country-wide sustainable forest management, future afforestation or reforestation planning. Potential users include those studying forest community dynamics, regional tree growth, ecosystem stability, and health, as well as those working with conservation and sustainable management.

These events may alter the availability of oxygen and substrate utilized by soil microbes, which may impact the microbial decomposition rate in the different peat layers. We investigated the bacterial and fungal communities in surface (0-25 cm), subsurface (25-75 cm) and deep (> 76 cm) layers, and assessed the response of these communities to aerobic conditions and substrate of varying complexity additions to soils in Zoige peatlands, China. Bacterial and fungal communities varied in different peat layers, with the largest community sizes in the surface layer. The aerobic incubation significantly altered bacterial and fungal community compositions in the subsurface and deep layers. Both bacterial and fungal community size increased by 155% and 53% in the deep layer, respectively. Under aerobic conditions, substrate additions to soils significantly shifted fungal community compositions across all soil layers but not bacteria. Soil substrate increased the fungal community size by 130%-1000% in the subsurface layer without substantially altering bacterial abundance in any of the layers. Our results highlight the importance of vertical stratification in bacterial and fungal communities and the depth-dependent changes that occur under the influence of an aerobic environment and changes in the quality of the substrate. We suggest that fungi may be more sensitive to climate change than bacteria, especially in subsurface layers. Thus, this is an essential factor that needs to be considered when analyzing the role of microbes in peatland carbon dynamics.

However, crop growth simulations at large scales have often lacked consideration of variation in crop cultivars, which were represented by different sets of genetic coefficients in crops models. In this study, taking the phenology of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) as an example, we compared four different strategies for upscaling genetic parameters in phenology simulations at large scales with two experimental datasets. The first dataset was from field experiments comprising 40 different spring wheat cultivars at Altay (2014) and Yangling (2015-2017) station; the second dataset was historical (2010-2014) observed phenology records from 57 national agro-meteorological observation stations in China. The four strategies were the representative cultivar estimated at a single site (SSPs), the representative cultivar estimated at the 57 sites (NRPs), the various representative cultivars estimated at different agro-ecological zones (RRPs), and the virtual cultivars generated from the posterior distributions (VCPs). The posterior distributions aforesaid were established based on the calibrated parameter values of the 40 different spring wheat cultivars planted in Yangling. Then, 1000 sets of VCPs were randomly sampled from the posterior distributions. The results indicated that both the SSPs and NRPs strategy obtained large errors and uncertainties in spring wheat phenology simulations in China since only one representative cultivar was used. The RRPs strategy achieved the second high and the highest accuracy in anthesis and maturity data simulations. The VCPs strategy obtained the highest accuracy in anthesis simulation but relative larger errors in maturity simulation. The VCPs strategy can be directly used in large-scale crop growth simulations without tedious process of calibration. Hence, this strategy is recommended in areas where observations are scarce and for model users who not good at model parameter estimation.

Drought vulnerability of four different crops (wheat, rice, maize and sugarcane) cultivated in three provinces (Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan) within southwest China were investigated in this study. It was based on the drought index of standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) for -3- and -6 months timescales (SPEI-3 and SPEI-6). The correlation between the SPEI and the standardized yield residuals series index for the individual crops was estimated for the period from 1960 to 2018. The highest drought duration was recorded in the southern part of the study area especially in the Yunnan Province. For SPEI-3, 60% of the total area was affected by drought mainly during the months from August to December for about 13 years (2005-2018). In terms of SPEI-6, the total affected area by the drought exceeded 80% during the timeframe from 2009 to 2013. Among the studied crops, winter wheat had the highest annual crop yield losses particularly in 2010 when the loss exceeded 50%. The results of this study have implications for agricultural management and climate policymaking in minimizing the influence of drought under the warming climate in southwest China. Further, it provides greater insight into crop-climate interactions and sustainable crop production.					kumar, Pankaj/HPF-8395-2023; Mohammed (PhD), Safwan/AAA-7126-2019; Elbeltagi, Ahmed/P-4614-2018; Abdo, Hazem Ghassan/Z-3481-2019; Abdelwahab, Ossama.M.M/N-9357-2019; Alsafadi, Karam/AAI-5270-2020	Mohammed (PhD), Safwan/0000-0003-2311-6789; Elbeltagi, Ahmed/0000-0002-5506-9502; Abdo, Hazem Ghassan/0000-0001-9283-3947; Abdelwahab, Ossama.M.M/0000-0003-1095-4361; Alsafadi, Karam/0000-0001-8925-7918													0899-8418	1097-0088				APR	2022	42	5					3056	3075		10.1002/joc.7407	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.7407		NOV 2021											WOS:000713842200001

However, it is poorly known whether the phenological dynamics responding to climate change would increase the severity and frequency of frost in apple trees. Here, we investigated the variation of phenophase (budburst and fruit-setting) and the frost risk for apple trees in the Loess Plateau combined with phenology models driven by Global Climate Models (GCMs) under two emission scenarios (SSP2-RCP4.5 and SSP5-RCP8.5 for two time periods 2050s and 2090s, respectively). The results showed that apple budburst and fruit-setting are expected to be advanced to varying degrees, but the rate of advance is decreasing (budburst 0.04-0.14 d.y(-1), fruit-setting 0.12-0.22 d.y(-1)). The combinations of high emission scenarios and 'far' time periods (SSP5-RCP8.5, 2090s) in budburst and fruitsetting advance larger than conservative emission scenarios and 'near' time periods (SSP2-RCP4.5, 2050s). Furthermore, although frost frequency is expected to decrease about 0.09-0.36 d under both SSP2-RCP4.5 and SSP5-RCP8.5, frost intensity tends to increase about 0.004-0.008 degrees C.d(-1) (except SSP5-RCP8.5, 2090s). Due to the different directions of changes in frequency and intensity of frost under future time periods, overall frost risk showed regional differences. The unchanged or decreased frost risk distributed in the northern and southern areas of the study areas, while the increased frost risk mainly distributed across the central areas of the study areas. Finally, the advancement of two phenophase was disproportionately related to frost risks in the geographic distributions. Areas with large advance in phenophase were themselves expected to be at greater frost risk. Our findings will help to promote local preventative interventions for reasonably reducing the risk of late spring frosts in future climate warming scenarios.					zhou, yang/JED-3951-2023; Li, Jiawei/JOJ-9277-2023; cheng, cheng/JBR-8359-2023; Li, Mai-He/L-6390-2013; li, yurong/JMQ-8540-2023; ru, xiaoya/HGA-1327-2022	Li, Mai-He/0000-0002-7029-2841; 													0304-4238	1879-1018				JAN 27	2023	308								111604	10.1016/j.scienta.2022.111604	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2022.111604		OCT 2022											WOS:000880815700004

Multi-source data for site-specific soils, climates, and remotely sensed vegetation indices are essential for yield prediction. Algorithms of data-model fusion for crop growth monitoring and yield prediction are complicated and need to be optimized to deal with model uncertainty. This study integrated multi-source environmental variables (e.g., satellite-based vegetation indices, climate data, and soil properties) into random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models for wheat yield prediction in China. The performance of both RF and SVM models was investigated using different types of vegetation indices associated with other predictors. Relative importance and partial dependence analyses were used to identify the main predictors and their relationships with wheat yield. We found that using remotely sensed vegetation indices improved our model precision, and that near-infrared reflectance of terrestrial vegetation (NIRv) was slightly better than normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in predicting yield. NIRv was better in detecting climate stress on crops, and could capture more information regarding crop growth and yield formation. Compared with the SVM model, the RF model with NIRv and other covariates had better performance in wheat yield prediction, with R-2 and RMSE being 0.74 and 758 kg/ha respectively. We also found that NIRv from jointing to heading was the most important predictor in determining yield, followed by solar radiation (especially during tillering-heading), relative humidity (during planting-tillering), soil organic carbon, and wind speed (throughout the growing season). In addition, wheat yield exhibited threshold-like responses to most factors based on our RF model. These threshold values can help to better understand how different environmental factors limit wheat yield, which will provide useful information for climate-adaptive crop management. Our findings demonstrated the potential of using NIRv for yield prediction. This approach is broadly applicable to other regions globally using publicly available data.

Plastic film mulching (PFM) is one of the major agricultural practices in semi-arid areas, but few studies have synthetically studied the effects of PFM on GHGI, grain yield, soil char-acteristics, and their potential relationships at different winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) growing stages. Here in the semi-arid Chinese Loess Plateau, we simultaneously investigated two cropping systems from 2018 to 2020: PFM with 100 % cover and no film mulching (control). Averaged across two growing seasons, the PFM treatment significantly increased soil temperature, water-filled pore spaces and soil water storage, while sustaining high aboveground biomass (31.9 %) and grain yield (45.5 %). The PFM treatment significantly increased cumulative N2O emissions by 56.2 %, CO2 emissions by 39.7 %, and CH4 uptake by 151.4 % compared to the control treatment. GHGI are on average 14.2 % lower in the PFM treatment than in the control treatment. Moreover, the PFM treatment significantly improved soil enzyme activities (alkaline phosphatase, catalase, invertase, and urease) and microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen from grain filling to maturity stage. Altogether, the re-ductions in GHGI suggest that PFM-induced increases in grain yield could outweigh the adverse impacts on GHG emissions, underscoring the potential to apply PFM for sustainable intensification of crop production in semi-arid areas.					wu, wenjie/IUN-9258-2023; Chen, Ji/A-6299-2018; wu, wenjie/HKM-3623-2023; Siddique, Kadambot H.M./B-3462-2011; Zhang, Yuefang/W-9045-2019	Chen, Ji/0000-0001-7026-6312; Siddique, Kadambot H.M./0000-0001-6097-4235; Li, Yue/0000-0002-9358-8178													0378-3774	1873-2283				DEC 1	2022	274								107941	10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107941	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107941		SEP 2022											WOS:000872378000001

However, it remains poorly understood whether this is true at broad scales where soil P strongly rely on climate, soil type and vegetation type. Here, based on the data of 946 mature natural forest sites from a nationwide field survey in China, we analyzed the impact of tree species richness on soil P density of China's mature natural forests (deciduous coniferous forest, DCF; evergreen coniferous forest, ECF; deciduous broad-leaved forest, DBF; evergreen broad-leaved forest, EBF; and mixed coniferous and broad-leaved forest, MF). Our results showed that tree species richness had a negative effect on soil P density in China's mature natural forests. The Random Forest regression model showed that the relative importance of tree species richness to soil P density was second only to the climate factors (mean annual temperature, MAT; mean annual precipitation, MAP).

Influenced on the different regional/local environments, the contributions of recycled moisture to precipitation present as different proportions. Recycled moisture has an important impact on the hydrological cycle, further occurred a series of environmental effect for regional/local. Aimed to estimate the contribution of recycled moisture to precipitation in an enclosed basin, Guanzhong Basin of northern China, precipitation and lake/reservoir samples were collected. The isotope ratio analysis was done for the summer season, and a three-component mixing model based on the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes was applied. The results indicated that the averaged contribution of recycled moisture to precipitation was 17.44% in Guanzhong Basin of northern China, while the mean proportions of surface evaporation moisture and transpiration moisture were found to be 0.38% and 16.97%, respectively. Comparatively, most of the recycled moisture mainly comes from transpiration moisture rather than evaporation moisture, suggesting that transpiration moisture from cropland, vegetation, and plants instead of evaporation is dominant in moisture recycling of the Guanzhong Basin.					li, xiao/HJP-5134-2023; Li, xiaofei/GXF-7187-2022; LI, ZHI/D-7204-2015; Tripathee, Lekhendra/T-4350-2019; Junji, Cao/D-3259-2014	LI, ZHI/0000-0002-9268-6497; Tripathee, Lekhendra/0000-0001-6210-5105; Junji, Cao/0000-0003-1000-7241; Wang, Shengjie/0000-0001-8095-2674													0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2020	27	22			SI		27926	27936		10.1007/s11356-020-09099-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09099-z		MAY 2020						32405940					WOS:000532643300012

It invaded the Mediterranean over the past century and most of the Caribbean over the last two decades. Understanding the main drivers behind the successful invasiveness of H. stipulacea has become crucial. We performed a comprehensive study including field measurements, a mesocosm experiment, and a literature review to identify 'superior growth traits' that can potentially explain the success story of H. stipulacea. We assessed meadow characteristics and plant traits of three invasive H. stipulacea populations growing off the Island of Sint Eustatius (eastern Caribbean). We compared similar parameters between native (Eilat, northern Red Sea) and invasive (Caribbean) H. stipulacea plants in a common-garden mesocosm. Lastly, we compared our field measurements with published data. The newly arrived H. stipulacea plants from St. Eustatius were characterized by higher percent cover, higher below- and above-ground biomasses, more apical shoots, and faster leaf turnover rates than those measured in both native and older invaded habitats. These results were further confirmed by the mesocosm experiment where the invasive H. stipulacea plants grew faster and developed more apical shoots than the native plants. Results suggest that increased growth vigour is one of the main invasive traits that characterize successful invasive H. stipulacea populations in the Caribbean and potentially in other invaded areas. We encourage long-term monitoring of H. stipulacea in both native and invaded habitats to better understand the future spread of this species and its impacts on communities and their ecosystem functions and services.

Stomatal responses of terrestrial plants to global change	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Stomatal conductance is an important plant ecophysiological trait and a common parameter in earth system models. This global meta-analysis shows how CO2, warming and other global change factors affect stomatal conductance individually and interactively. Quantifying the stomatal responses of plants to global change factors is crucial for modeling terrestrial carbon and water cycles. Here we synthesize worldwide experimental data to show that stomatal conductance (g(s)) decreases with elevated carbon dioxide (CO2), warming, decreased precipitation, and tropospheric ozone pollution, but increases with increased precipitation and nitrogen (N) deposition. These responses vary with treatment magnitude, plant attributes (ambient g(s), vegetation biomes, and plant functional types), and climate. All two-factor combinations (except warming + N deposition) significantly reduce g(s), and their individual effects are commonly additive but tend to be antagonistic as the effect sizes increased. We further show that rising CO2 and warming would dominate the future change of plant g(s) across biomes. The results of our meta-analysis provide a foundation for understanding and predicting plant g(s) across biomes and guiding manipulative experiment designs in a real world where global change factors do not occur in isolation.

However, it remains largely unclear how soil microbial communities respond to long-term, moderate warming. In this study, we used Illumina sequencing and microarrays (GeoChip 5.0) to analyze taxonomic and functional gene compositions of the soil microbial community after 14 years of warming (at 0.8-1.0 degrees C for 10 years and then 1.5-2.0 degrees C for 4 years) in a Californian grassland. Long-term warming had no detectable effect on the taxonomic composition of soil bacterial community, nor on any plant or abiotic soil variables. In contrast, functional gene compositions differed between warming and control for bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities. Functional genes associated with labile carbon (C) degradation increased in relative abundance in the warming treatment, whereas those associated with recalcitrant C degradation decreased. A number of functional genes associated with nitrogen (N) cycling (e.g., denitrifying genes encoding nitrate-, nitrite-, and nitrous oxidereductases) decreased, whereas nifH gene encoding nitrogenase increased in the warming treatment. These results suggest that microbial functional potentials are more sensitive to long-term moderate warming than the taxonomic composition of microbial community.

FIRST EXPERIENCES WITH A NOVEL FARMER CITIZEN SCIENCE APPROACH: CROWDSOURCING PARTICIPATORY VARIETY SELECTION THROUGH ON-FARM TRIADIC COMPARISONS OF TECHNOLOGIES (TRICOT)	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												Rapid climatic and socio-economic changes challenge current agricultural R&D capacity. The necessary quantum leap in knowledge generation should build on the innovation capacity of farmers themselves. A novel citizen science methodology, triadic comparisons of technologies or tricot, was implemented in pilot studies in India, East Africa, and Central America. The methodology involves distributing a pool of agricultural technologies in different combinations of three to individual farmers who observe these technologies under farm conditions and compare their performance. Since the combinations of three technologies overlap, statistical methods can piece together the overall performance ranking of the complete pool of technologies. The tricot approach affords wide scaling, as the distribution of trial packages and instruction sessions is relatively easy to execute, farmers do not need to be organized in collaborative groups, and feedback is easy to collect, even by phone. The tricot approach provides interpretable, meaningful results and was widely accepted by farmers. The methodology underwent improvement in data input formats. A number of methodological issues remain: integrating environmental analysis, capturing gender-specific differences, stimulating farmers' motivation, and supporting implementation with an integrated digital platform.

However, their quantitative relationship is not invariant, which undermines the reliability of empirical SIF-based GPP estimation at fine spatiotemporal scales, especially under extreme conditions. In this study, we developed a parsimonious mechanistic model for SIF-based GPP estimation in evergreen needle forests (ENF) by employing the Mechanistic Light Response framework and Eco-Evolutionary theory to describe the light and dark reactions during photosynthesis, respectively. Specifically, we found that considering the seasonal variation in a key parameter of the MLR framework, the maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Phi(PSIImax)), can avoid the GPP overestimation in winter and early spring due to the relatively low environmental sensitivity of SIF. Compared to the estimates from other benchmark models, our GPP estimates were closer to the 1: 1 line and had higher accuracy (average R-2 = 0.86, RMSE=1.99 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) across sites. Furthermore, the changes in the relationship between SIF and J (refers to the electron transport rate) contribute a lot to the dynamic SIF-GPP relationship in this study, while the J-GPP relationship is less variant when the temperature drops. The seasonal variation in the SIF-J relationship, especially the reduction in its slope at low temperatures, is found largely explained by the Phi(PSIImax). These results indicate the importance of the uncertainty caused by the variation in the SIF-J relationship for SIF-based GPP estimation, and the consideration of changes in Phi(PSIImax) under extreme conditions (such as severe winter in this study) is crucial for the improvement of GPP estimation via SIF.

However, this may not be true in a warming climate. Here we use a crop model and a machine learning algorithm to demonstrate the changing impacts of climate drivers on wheat productivity in Australia. We find that, from the end of the nineteenth century to the 1980s, wheat productivity was mainly subject to the impacts of the El Nino Southern Oscillation. Since the 1990s, the impacts from the El Nino Southern Oscillation have been decreasing, but those from the Indian Ocean Dipole have been increasing. The warming climate has brought more occurrences of positive Indian Ocean Dipole events, resulting in severe yield reductions in recent decades. Our findings highlight the need to adapt seasonal forecasting to the changing impacts of climate variability to inform the management of climate-induced yield losses. Simulated annual wheat yields during 1889-2020 show that, since the 1990s, Indian Ocean Dipole has replaced El Nino Southern Oscillation as the dominant climate driver across most of the Australian wheatbelt. The occurrences of more positive Indian Ocean Dipole events in recent decades resulted in severe yield reductions.

Sustainable chemical preventive models in COVID-19: Understanding, innovation, adaptations, and impact	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												COVID-19 is considered as a major public health problem caused by the SARS CoV-2. This Viral infection is known to induce worldwide pandemic in short period of time. Emerging evidence suggested that the transmission control and drug therapy may influence the preventive measures extensively as the host surrounding environment and pathogenic mechanism may contribute to the pandemic condition earlier in COVID-19 disease. Although, several animals identified as reservoir to date, however human-to-human transmission is well documented. Human beings are sustaining the virus in the communities and act as an amplifier of the virus. Human activities i.e., living with the patient, touching patient waste etc. in the surrounding of active patients or asymptomatic persons cause significant risk factors for transmission. On the other hand, drug target and mechanism to destroy the virus or virus inhibition depends on diversified approaches of drugs and different target for virus life cycle. This article describes the sustainable chemical preventive models understanding, requirements, technology adaptation and the implementation strategies in these pandemic-like situations. As the outbreak progresses, healthcare models focused on transmission control through disinfections and sanitization based on risk calculations. Identification of the most suitable target of drugs and regional control model of transmission are of high priority. In the early stages of an outbreak, availability of epidemiological information is important to encourage preventive measures efforts by public health authorities and provide robust evidence to guide interventions. Here, we have discussed the level of adaptations in technology that research professionals display toward their public health preventive models. We should compile a representative data set of adaptations that humans can consider for transmission control and adopt for viruses and their hosts. Overall, there are many aspects of the chemical science and technology in virus preventive measures. Herein, the most recent advances in this context are discussed, and the possible reasons behind the sustainable preventive model are presented. This kind of sustainable preventive model having adaptation and implementation with green chemistry system will reduce the shedding of the virus into the community by eco-friendly methods, and thus the risk of transmission and infection progression can be mitigated.

However, the impacts of human-driven environmental changes on the stability of natural grasslands have been typically assessed by comparing differences between manipulative plots and reference plots. Little is known about whether or how ambient climate regulates the effects of manipulative treatments and their underlying mechanisms. We collected two datasets, one a 36-year long-term observational dataset from 1983 to 2018, and the other a 10-year manipulative asymmetric warming and grazing experiment using infrared heaters with moderate grazing from 2006 to 2015 in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. The 36-year observational dataset shows that there was a nonlinear response of community stability to ambient temperature with a positive relationship between them due to an increase in ambient temperature in the first 25 years and then a decrease in ambient temperature thereafter. Warming and grazing decreased community stability with experiment duration through an increase in legume cover and a decrease in species asynchrony, which was due to the decreasing background temperature through time during the 10-year experiment period. Moreover, the temperature sensitivity of community stability was higher under the ambient treatment than under the manipulative treatments. Therefore, our results suggested that ambient climate may control the directional trend of community stability while manipulative treatments may determine the temperature sensitivity of the response of community stability to climate relative to the ambient treatment. Our study emphasizes the importance of the context dependency of the response of community stability to human-driven environmental changes.

Over the past few decades, a natural disaster has accelerated its occurrence, which has significantly impacted agricultural systems, economies, environments, water resources, and supplies. Therefore, it is essential to develop new techniques that enable comprehensive determination and observations of droughts over large areas with satisfactory spatial and temporal resolution. This study modeled a new drought index called the Combined Terrestrial Evapotranspiration Index (CTEI), developed in the Ganga river basin. For this, five Machine Learning (ML) techniques, derived from artificial intelligence theories, were applied: the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, decision trees, Matern 5/2 Gaussian process regression, boosted trees, and bagged trees. These techniques were driven by twelve different models generated from input combinations of satellite data and hydrometeorological parameters. The results indicated that the eighth model performed best and was superior among all the models, with the SVM algorithm resulting in an R-2 value of 0.82 and the lowest errors in terms of the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) (0.33) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) (0.20), followed by the Matern 5/2 Gaussian model with an R-2 value of 0.75 and RMSE and MAE of 0.39 and 0.21 mm/day, respectively. Moreover, among all the five methods, the SVM and Matern 5/2 Gaussian methods were the best-performing ML algorithms in our study of CTEI predictions for the Ganga basin.

Boron availability in soils and its nutrition of crops under long-term fertility experiments in India	GEODERMA												Using 12 long-term (of 15 to 42 years duration) experiments with different cropping systems under various soils and agro-climatic conditions, we studied how different (inorganic and integrated) nutrient management practices influenced boron (B) availability in soils, and its nutrition of nine crops. To this end, four nutrient management practices viz., NPK (recommended dose of N, P and K), NPK + FYM (farmyard manure), control and fallow, which were common in all the experiments, were selected and their effects on B availability in soils were tested using four commonly used methods viz., hot-CaCl2 (HCC), KH2PO4 (PDP), mannitol-CaCl2 (MCC) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) in relation to B nutrition of wheat, rice, cowpea, sorghum, sesame, mustard, groundnut, soybean and lentil. Amounts of B extracted by the four different methods followed the order HCC = HCl > MCC > PDP across the tested soils. Averaged over the extractants, long-term nutrient management practices with NPK + FYM resulted in 15% increases in available B in soil over the control, which produced 20% increase in plant tissue B concentration. Such increases with integrated (NPK + FYM) nutrient management practices maintained available B in soils and plant tissues above its critical limits that supplied adequate amounts of B for nutrition of all the tested crops grown intensively for so many years. A B balance study in six experimental sites showed a net B accumulation over time as irrigation water contained and supplied (130-296 g B ha(-1) year(-1)) more B than removed by harvested crops. Of the four methods used, HCC was the best for assessment of availability of B in soils under long-term cultivation.

Frequent historical YR flooding events, however, have resulted in tremendous loss of life and property, whereas in recent decades YR runoff and sediment load have fallen sharply. To put these recent changes in a longer-term context, we reconstructed natural runoff for the middle reach of the YR back to 1492 CE using a network of 31 moisture-sensitive treering width chronologies. Prior to anthropogenic interference that started in the 1960s, the lowest natural runoff over the past 500 y occurred during 1926 to 1932 CE, a drought period that can serve as a benchmark for future planning of YR water allocation. Since the late 1980s, the low observed YR runoff has exceeded the natural range of runoff variability, a consequence of the combination of decreasing precipitation and increasing water consumption by direct and indirect human activities, particularly agricultural irrigation. This reduced runoff has resulted in an estimated 58% reduction of the sediment load in the upper reach of the YR and 29% reduction in the middle reach.

The male displays including mode and frequency of antennation and position while copulating, the displays further comprises of intensity and frequency of rejecting behaviour. The presence of the male's copulatory and postcopulatory courtship studies, understands the maintenance of monandry. The wasp has numerous secondary sexual characters, and the mating behaviour follows a phyletic and the specific sexual mating characters in context of sexual selection. The duration of mating phases and the number of male antennation series during precopulatory, copulatory and postcopulatory phases of mounting, differs significantly. Mating success depends mostly on the activities of male in the premounting phase and the behaviour of both sexes has a roughly equal importance for it in precopulatory phase. While during copulation, activity of male has little influence on its duration; however, behaviour of female has crucial effect, inducing its earlier termination. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

The database was compiled through a global collaboration between a network of researchers, meteorological services and environmental organisations from 65 countries. GloREDa is the first open access database of rainfall erosivity (R-factor) based on hourly and sub-hourly rainfall records at a global scale. This database is now stored and accessible for download in the long-term European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC) repository of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre. This will ensure the further development of the database with insertions of new records, maintenance of the data and provision of a helpdesk. In addition to the annual erosivity data, this release also includes the mean monthly erosivity data for 94% of the GloREDa stations. Based on these mean monthly R-factor values, we predict the global monthly erosivity datasets at 1 km resolution using the ensemble machine learning approach (ML) as implemented in the mlr package for R.

However, most ecosystem services (ESs) models (e.g., InVEST and ARIES) ignored the relationships among ESs. Process-based models can overcome this limitation, and the integration of ecological models with remote sensing data could greatly facilitate the investigation of the complex ecological processes. Therefore, based on the Carbon and Exchange between Vegetation, Soil, and Atmosphere (CEVSA) models, we developed a process-based ES model (CEVSA-ES) integrating remotely sensed leaf area index to evaluate four important ESs (i.e., productivity provision, carbon sequestration, water retention, and soil retention) at annual timescale in China. Compared to the traditional terrestrial biosphere models, the main innovation of CEVSA-ES model was the consideration of soil erosion processes and its impact on carbon cycling. The new version also improved the carbon-water cycle algorithms. Then, the Sobol and DEMC methods that integrated the CEVSA-ES model with nine flux sites comprising 39 site-years were used to identify and optimize parameters. Finally, the model using the optimized parameters was validated at 26 field sites comprising 135 site-years. Simulation results showed good fits with ecosystem processes, explaining 95%, 92%, 76%, and 65% interannual variabilities of gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration, net ecosystem productivity, and evapotranspiration, respectively. The CEVSA-ES model performed well for productivity provision and carbon sequestration, which explained 96% and 81% of the spatial-temporal variations of the observed annual productivity provision and carbon sequestration, respectively. The model also captured the interannual trends of water retention and soil erosion for most sites or basins.

The interactive mechanisms of long-term fertilization affecting the functional soil organic matter (SOM) fractions, microbial community, and enzyme activities are unclear. We investigated the effects of manure and mineral fertilization on six SOM fractions (non-protected, physically, chemically, biochemically, physical-chemically, and physical-biochemically protected), microbial community structure, and enzyme activities based on a 35-year fertilization experiment. The combined application of manure and mineral fertilizers (NPKM) increased the soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in the biochemically (28.6-43.9%) and physically (108-229%) protected fractions, compared to their content in the unfertilized soil (CK). The total phospholipid fatty acid content, Gram(-) bacteria, and actinomycetes, as well as the activities of alpha-1,4-glucosidase, beta-1-4-N-acetylglucosaminidase, beta-1,4-xylosidase, and cellobiohydrolase were highest under NPKM fertilization. The protected SOM fractions (physical, biochemical, physical-chemical, and physical-biochemical) were closely related to microbial community composition (accounting for 67.6% of the variance). Bacteria were sensitive to changes in the physically and biochemically protected fractions, whereas fungi responded more to the changes in the chemically protected fraction. In summary, long-term mineral and organic fertilization has a strong effect on microbial communities and activities through the changes in the functional SOM fractions.

The human population in drylands, currently estimated at 2.7 billion, faces limited access to sufficient, affordable, and nutritious food. We discuss the interlinkages among water security, environmental security, energy security, economic security, health security, and food security governance, and how they affect food security in drylands. Reliable and adequate water supply, and the prevention of water contamination, increase the potential for ample food, fodder, and fiber production. Protecting woodlands and rangelands increases food security by buffering the slow onset effects of climate change, including biodiversity loss, desertification, salinization, and land degradation. The protection of natural lands is expected to decrease environmental contamination, and simultaneously, reduce the transfer of diseases from wildlife to humans. Biofuel production and hydroelectric power plants increase energy security but generate land-use conflicts, deforestation, and ecosystem degradation. Economic security generally positively correlates with food security. However, economic growth often degrades the environment, changes tenure rights over natural resources, and stimulates migration to urban areas, resulting in lower food and health security. Moreover, civil unrest, political instability, and armed conflicts disrupt local economies in drylands. Maintaining food security is crucial for health security; conversely, malnourished populations and unresponsive health systems decrease economic security, and adversely affect environmental, energy, and food security. Climate change is expected to deteriorate health security by spreading vector-borne diseases. Effective governance and timely interventions can substantially shorten periods of food insecurity, lower their intensities, and accelerate recovery from inevitable crises, and are therefore crucial in preventing humanitarian crises. Since global drylands population will nearly double by 2050, and since drylands are among the most susceptible areas to climate change, integrated multi-hazard approaches to food security are needed.

The Three Gorges Dam (TGD) is the largest hydraulic engineering project in the world. We present a direct, ecosystem-scale demonstration of changes in the soil \ organic carbon (SOC) content in the TGD watershed before and after the surface water was reshaped. The average SOC content decreased from 12.9 to 9.5 g/kg between 2004 and 2012 and then recovered to 13.8 g/kg in 2017. Dynamics of SOC were partly attributed to shifts in the composition of soil microbial communities responsible for carbon biogeochemistry. The shifts in microbial taxa were associated with the changed microclimate affected by the TGD as well as global and regional climate variability. The microclimate, soil microorganisms, and plant organic carbon input explained 40.2% of the variation in the SOC content. This study revealed that dam construction was an important and indirect driver for the SOC turnover, and the subsequent effects on the upland soil ecosystem must be considered when large-scale disturbance activities (such as dam construction) are conducted in the future.

However, they are adversely affected by water erosion processes after extreme land cover modifications such as wildfires or intensive agricultural activities. The main goal of this research was to clarify the dynamic interaction between erosion processes and different ecosystem components (inclination, land cover/land use, and rainy storms) along with the vulnerable territory of the CRoS. Experiments were carried out in five different locations using a total of 15 erosion plots. Soil loss and runoff were quantified in each experimental plot, considering different inclinations and land uses (agricultural land (AG), burnt forest (BF), forest/control plot (F)). Observed runoff and soil loss varied greatly according to both inclination and land cover after 750 mm of rainfall (26 events). In the cultivated areas, the average soil water erosion ranged between 0.14 +/- 0.07 and 0.74 +/- 0.33 kg/m(2); in the BF plots, mean soil erosion ranged between 0.03 +/- 0.01 and 0.24 +/- 0.10 kg/m(2). The lowest amount of erosion was recorded in the F plots where the erosion ranged between 0.1 +/- 0.001 and 0.07 +/- 0.03 kg/m(2). Interestingly, the General Linear Model revealed that all factors (i.e., inclination, rainfall and land use) had a significant (p < 0.001) effect on the soil loss. We concluded that human activities greatly influenced soil erosion rates, being higher in the AG lands, followed by BF and F. Therefore, the current study could be very useful to policymakers and planners for proposing immediate conservation or restoration plans in a less studied area which has been shown to be vulnerable to soil erosion processes.

Its research object is the natural environment which is closely related to human living and development, and China's natural environment is complex and diverse. According to national needs and regional development, physical geographers have achieved remarkable achievements in applied basis and applied research, which also has substantially contributed to the planning of national economic growth and social development, the protection of macro ecosystems and resources, and sustainable regional development. This study summarized the practice and application of physical geography in China over the past 70 years in the following fields: regional differences in natural environments and physical regionalization; land use and land cover changes; natural hazards and risk reduction; process and prevention of desertification; upgrading of medium- and low-yield fields in the Huang-Huai-Hai region; engineering construction in permafrost areas; geochemical element anomalies and the prevention and control of endemic diseases; positioning and observation of physical geographical elements; and identification of geospatial differentiation and geographical detectors. Furthermore, we have proposed the future direction of applied research in the field of physical geography.

Limited available forest inventories mean the carbon balance remains uncertain. Here we analyse annual live and dead above-ground carbon changes derived from low-frequency passive microwave observations from 2010 to 2019. We find that during this period, the carbon balance of Siberian forests was close to neutral, with the forests acting as a small carbon sink of +0.02(+0.01)(+0.03) PgC yr(-1). Carbon storage in dead wood increased, but this was largely offset by a decrease in live biomass. Substantial losses of live above-ground carbon are attributed to fire and drought, such as the widespread fires in northern Siberia in 2012 and extreme drought in eastern Siberia in 2015. These live above-ground carbon losses contrast with "greening' trends seen in leaf area index over the same period, a decoupling explained by faster post-disturbance recovery of leaf area than live above-ground carbon. Our study highlights the vulnerability of large forest carbon stores in Siberia to climate-induced disturbances, challenging the persistence of the carbon sink in this region of the globe.

Recently, several gridded forest AGB products have been produced for China by integrating remote sensing data and field measurements, yet significant discrepancies remain among these products in their estimated AGB carbon, varying from 5.04 to 9.81 Pg C. To reduce this uncertainty, here, we first compiled independent, high-quality field measurements of AGB using a systematic and consistent protocol across China from 2011 to 2015. We applied two different approaches, an optimal weighting technique (WT) and a random forest regression method (RF), to develop two observationally constrained hybrid forest AGB products in China by integrating five existing AGB products. The WT method uses a linear combination of the five existing AGB products with weightings that minimize biases with respect to the field measurements, and the RF method uses decision trees to predict a hybrid AGB map by minimizing the bias and variance with respect to the field measurements. The forest AGB stock in China was 7.73 Pg C for the WT estimates and 8.13 Pg C for the RF estimates. Evaluation with the field measurements showed that the two hybrid AGB products had a lower RMSE (29.6 and 24.3 Mg/ha) and bias (-4.6 and -3.8 Mg/ha) than all five participating AGB datasets. Our study demonstrated both the WT and RF methods can be used to harmonize existing AGB maps with field measurements to improve the spatial variability and reduce the uncertainty of carbon stocks. The new spatial AGB maps of China can be used to improve estimates of carbon emissions and removals at the national and subnational scales.					wang, ying-ping/A-9765-2011; Hobeichi, Sanaa/GLQ-8369-2022; Wang, Ying/HJI-2509-2023; DU, SHENG/A-7528-2008; Li, Sheng-Gong/H-5101-2012; Abramowitz, Gab/P-3969-2019; Huang, huabing/JHT-7278-2023; Wigneron, Jean-Pierre André/ABD-9939-2021; Cao, Nannan/L-7638-2017	wang, ying-ping/0000-0002-4614-6203; Hobeichi, Sanaa/0000-0001-6825-3854; DU, SHENG/0000-0002-5580-399X; Li, Sheng-Gong/0000-0003-4889-9927; Abramowitz, Gab/0000-0002-4205-001X; Huang, huabing/0000-0001-6253-8437; Wigneron, Jean-Pierre André/0000-0001-5345-3618; fan, lei/0000-0002-1834-5088; Cao, Nannan/0000-0002-4311-058X; Yu, Mengxiao/0000-0002-9721-9353														2072-4292				AUG	2021	13	15							2892	10.3390/rs13152892	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13152892													WOS:000682285300001

P.			Carbon, water and energy fluxes in agricultural systems of Australia and New Zealand	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												A comprehensive understanding of the effects of agricultural management on climate-crop interactions has yet to emerge. Using a novel wavelet-statistics conjunction approach, we analysed the synchronisation amongst fluxes (net ecosystem exchange NEE, evapotranspiration and sensible heat flux) and seven environmental factors (e.g., air temperature, soil water content) on 19 farm sites across Australia and New Zealand. Irrigation and fertilisation practices improved positive coupling between net ecosystem productivity (NEP = - NEE) and evapotranspiration, as hypothesised. Highly intense management tended to protect against heat stress, especially for irrigated crops in dry climates. By contrast, stress avoidance in the vegetation of tropical and hot desert climates was identified by reverse coupling between NEP and sensible heat flux (i.e., increases in NEP were synchronised with decreases in sensible heat flux). Some environmental factors were found to be under management control, whereas others were fixed as constraints at a given location. Irrigated crops in dry climates (e.g., maize, almonds) showed high predictability of fluxes given only knowledge of fluctuations in climate (R-2 > 0.78), and fluxes were nearly as predictable across strongly energy- or water-limited environments (0.60 < R-2 < 0.89). However, wavelet regression of environmental conditions on fluxes showed much smaller predictability in response to precipitation pulses (0.15 < R-2 < 0.55), where mowing or grazing affected crop phenology (0.28 < R-2 < 0.59), and where water and energy limitations were balanced (0.7 < net radiation / precipitation < 1.3; 0.27 < R-2 < 0.36). By incorporating a temporal component to regression, wavelet-statistics conjunction provides an important step forward for understanding direct ecosystem responses to environmental change, for modelling that understanding, and for quantifying nonstationary, nonlinear processes such as precipitation pulses, which have previously defied quantitative analysis.

Historical (1700-2012) global multi-model estimates of the fire emissions from the Fire Modeling Intercomparison Project (FireMIP)	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Fire emissions are a critical component of carbon and nutrient cycles and strongly affect climate and air quality. Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) with interactive fire modeling provide important estimates for long-term and large-scale changes in fire emissions. Here we present the first multi-model estimates of global gridded historical fire emissions for 1700-2012, including carbon and 33 species of trace gases and aerosols. The dataset is based on simulations of nine DGVMs with different state-of-the-art global fire models that participated in the Fire Modeling Intercomparison Project (FireMIP), using the same and standardized protocols and forcing data, and the most up-to-date fire emission factor table based on field and laboratory studies in various land cover types. We evaluate the simulations of present-day fire emissions by comparing them with satellite-based products. The evaluation results show that most DGVMs simulate present-day global fire emission totals within the range of satellite-based products. They can capture the high emissions over the tropical savannas and low emissions over the arid and sparsely vegetated regions, and the main features of seasonality. However, most models fail to simulate the interannual variability, partly due to a lack of modeling peat fires and tropical deforestation fires. Before the 1850s, all models show only a weak trend in global fire emissions, which is consistent with the multi-source merged historical reconstructions used as input data for CMIP6. On the other hand, the trends are quite different among DGVMs for the 20th century, with some models showing an increase and others a decrease in fire emissions, mainly as a result of the discrepancy in their simulated responses to human population density change and land use and land cover change (LULCC). Our study provides an important dataset for further development of regional and global multi-source merged historical reconstructions, analyses of the historical changes in fire emissions and their uncertainties, and quantification of the role of fire emissions in the Earth system. It also highlights the importance of accurately modeling the responses of fire emissions to LULCC and population density change in reducing uncertainties in historical reconstructions of fire emissions and providing more reliable future projections.

Despite the great emphasis laid on stability-related investigations, publications lack consistency in experimental procedures and parameters reported. It is therefore challenging to reproduce and compare results and thereby develop a deep understanding of degradation mechanisms. Here, we report a consensus between researchers in the field on procedures for testing perovskite solar cell stability, which are based on the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS) protocols. We propose additional procedures to account for properties specific to PSCs such as ion redistribution under electric fields, reversible degradation and to distinguish ambient-induced degradation from other stress factors. These protocols are not intended as a replacement of the existing qualification standards, but rather they aim to unify the stability assessment and to understand failure modes. Finally, we identify key procedural information which we suggest reporting in publications to improve reproducibility and enable large data set analysis. Reliability of stability data for perovskite solar cells is undermined by a lack of consistency in the test conditions and reporting. This Consensus Statement outlines practices for testing and reporting stability tailoring ISOS protocols for perovskite devices.

Consequences of intraspecific variation in seed dispersal for plant demography, communities, evolution and global change	AOB PLANTS												As the single opportunity for plants to move, seed dispersal has an important impact on plant fitness, species distributions and patterns of biodiversity. However, models that predict dynamics such as risk of extinction, range shifts and biodiversity loss tend to rely on the mean value of parameters and rarely incorporate realistic dispersal mechanisms. By focusing on the mean population value, variation among individuals or variability caused by complex spatial and temporal dynamics is ignored. This calls for increased efforts to understand individual variation in dispersal and integrate it more explicitly into population and community models involving dispersal. However, the sources, magnitude and outcomes of intraspecific variation in dispersal are poorly characterized, limiting our understanding of the role of dispersal in mediating the dynamics of communities and their response to global change. In this manuscript, we synthesize recent research that examines the sources of individual variation in dispersal and emphasize its implications for plant fitness, populations and communities. We argue that this intraspecific variation in seed dispersal does not simply add noise to systems, but, in fact, alters dispersal processes and patterns with consequences for demography, communities, evolution and response to anthropogenic changes. We conclude with recommendations for moving this field of research forward.

Here we quantify the pure effect of historical and future climate change on the exposure of land and population to extreme climate impact events using an unprecedentedly large ensemble of harmonized climate impact simulations from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project phase 2b. Our results indicate that global warming has already more than doubled both the global land area and the global population annually exposed to all six categories of extreme events considered: river floods, tropical cyclones, crop failure, wildfires, droughts, and heatwaves. Global warming of 2 degrees C relative to preindustrial conditions is projected to lead to a more than fivefold increase in cross-category aggregate exposure globally. Changes in exposure are unevenly distributed, with tropical and subtropical regions facing larger increases than higher latitudes. The largest increases in overall exposure are projected for the population of South Asia. Plain Language Summary Global warming changes the frequency, intensity, and spatial distribution of extreme events. We analyze computer simulations of river floods, tropical cyclones, crop failure, wildfires, droughts, and heatwaves under past, present-day, and potential future climate conditions. Our results show that global warming increases the number of people around the world that are affected by these events each year, both for all event types combined and each type individually. Changes in the chance of being affected by extreme events are unevenly distributed in space. Particularly large increases are simulated for tropical and subtropical regions.

Here we report its high-quality, chromosome-scale genome assembly using a combination of short-read sequencing, single-molecule real-time sequencing, Hi-C, and a high-density genetic map. Phylogenetic analyses reveal two sets of homologous chromosomes that may have merged similar to 5.6 million years ago, both of which exhibit strong synteny with other grass species. Broomcorn millet contains 55,930 protein-coding genes and 339 microRNA genes. We find Paniceae-specific expansion in several subfamilies of the BTB (broad complex/tramtrack/bric-a-brac) subunit of ubiquitin E3 ligases, suggesting enhanced regulation of protein dynamics may have contributed to the evolution of broomcorn millet. In addition, we identify the coexistence of all three C-4 subtypes of carbon fixation candidate genes. The genome sequence is a valuable resource for breeders and will provide the foundation for studying the exceptional stress tolerance as well as C-4 biology.

However, our understanding of network structure may depend upon the temporal scale at which we sample and analyze network data. To date, we lack a comprehensive assessment of the temporal scale-dependence of network structure across a wide range of temporal scales and geographic locations. If network structure is temporally scale-dependent, networks constructed over different temporal scales may provide very different perspectives on the structure and composition of species interactions. Furthermore, it remains unclear how various factors - including species richness, species turnover, link rewiring and sampling effort - act in concert to shape network structure across different temporal scales. To address these issues, we used a large database of temporally-resolved plant-pollinator networks to investigate how temporal aggregation from the scale of one day to multiple years influences network structure. In addition, we used structural equation modeling to explore the direct and indirect effects of temporal scale, species richness, species turnover, link rewiring and sampling effort on network structural properties. We find that plant-pollinator network structure is strongly temporally-scale dependent. This general pattern arises because the temporal scale determines the degree to which temporal dynamics (i.e. phenological turnover of species and links) are included in the network, in addition to how much sampling effort is put into constructing the network. Ultimately, the temporal scale-dependence of our plant-pollinator networks appears to be mostly driven by species richness, which increases with sampling effort, and species turnover, which increases with temporal extent. In other words, after accounting for variation in species richness, network structure is increasingly shaped by its underlying temporal dynamics. Our results suggest that considering multiple temporal scales may be necessary to fully appreciate the causes and consequences of interaction network structure.

Over the past decade, China has experienced dramatic climate changes characterized by enhanced summer monsoon and decelerated warming. However, the changes in the trends of terrestrial net ecosystem production (NEP) in China under climate changes are not well documented. Here, we used three ecosystem models to simulate the spatiotemporal variations in China's NEP during 1982-2010 and quantify the contribution of the strengthened summer monsoon and warming hiatus to the NEP variations in four distinct climatic regions of the country. Our results revealed a decadal-scale shift in NEP from a downtrend of -5.95 Tg C/yr(2) (reduced sink) during 1982-2000 to an uptrend of 14.22 Tg C/yr(2) (enhanced sink) during 2000-10. This shift was essentially induced by the strengthened summer monsoon, which stimulated carbon uptake, and the warming hiatus, which lessened the decrease in the NEP trend. Compared to the contribution of 56.3% by the climate effect, atmospheric CO2 concentration and nitrogen deposition had relatively small contributions (8.6 and 11.3%, respectively) to the shift. In conclusion, within the context of the global-warming hiatus, the strengthening of the summer monsoon is a critical climate factor that enhances carbon uptake in China due to the asymmetric response of photosynthesis and respiration. Our study not only revealed the shift in ecosystem carbon sequestration in China in recent decades, but also provides some insight for understanding ecosystem carbon dynamics in other monsoonal areas.

Yet, seahorses show many adaptations for a sedentary, cryptic lifestyle: they require specific habitats, such as seagrass, kelp or coral reefs, lack pelvic and caudal fins, and give birth to directly developed offspring without pronounced pelagic larval stage, rendering long-range dispersal by conventional means inefficient. Here we investigate seahorses' worldwide dispersal and biogeographic patterns based on a de novo genome assembly of Hippocampus erectus as well as 358 re-sequenced genomes from 21 species. Seahorses evolved in the late Oligocene and subsequent circum-global colonization routes are identified and linked to changing dynamics in ocean currents and paleo-temporal seaway openings. Furthermore, the genetic basis of the recurring "bony spines" adaptive phenotype is linked to independent substitutions in a key developmental gene. Analyses thus suggest that rafting via ocean currents compensates for poor dispersal and rapid adaptation facilitates colonizing new habitats. A new seahorse genome and the re-sequenced genomes of 21 other species shed new light on the evolutionary origin and global dispersal routes of seahorses, and show that bony spines-a key adaptation against predation-probably evolved multiple times via independent substitutions in the bmp3 gene.

Ecological network complexity scales with area	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION												Larger geographical areas contain more species-an observation raised to a law in ecology. Less explored is whether biodiversity changes are accompanied by a modification of interaction networks. We use data from 32 spatial interaction networks from different ecosystems to analyse how network structure changes with area. We find that basic community structure descriptors (number of species, links and links per species) increase with area following a power law. Yet, the distribution of links per species varies little with area, indicating that the fundamental organization of interactions within networks is conserved. Our null model analyses suggest that the spatial scaling of network structure is determined by factors beyond species richness and the number of links. We demonstrate that biodiversity-area relationships can be extended from species counts to higher levels of network complexity. Therefore, the consequences of anthropogenic habitat destruction may extend from species loss to wider simplification of natural communities. Using 32 ecological networks (host-parasite, plant-pollinator, plant-herbivore and other food webs), the authors show that several network properties scale with the size of the sampling area, suggesting a new type of biodiversity-area relationship.

Various batches of P3HT were collected from different suppliers reflecting commercial availability as well as properties variability. Among the materials properties explicitly considered were the molar mass, dispersity, regio-regularity, impurities by trace metals and intrinsic doping evaluated from radical concentrations. Each of the participating laboratories contributing test devices applied their own layer stack, i.e. their own device architecture and layout. This variation was appreciated as another parameter for evaluation. Even though a large amount of devices failed due to extrinsic degradation effects, indeed, some materials properties were found to be more important than others for obtaining long lifetimes and high stability of P3HT-based polymer solar cells.

Here, the surface morphologies of a monocrystalline vertical silicon nanowire-based lithium microbattery were investigated against performance. Silicon has attracted considerable attention for use as high-capacity anodes of lithium-ion microbatteries. However, its extreme volume change upon (de-)lithiation still poses a challenge for adoption as it leads to severe active lithium loss that shortens the cycle life. Here, we fabricate three-dimensional monocrystalline vertical silicon nanowires on a silicon wafer using low-cost metal-assisted chemical etching, then cover them with lithium using thermal evaporation prior to the battery operation as the pre-lithiation step, to investigate its impact on electrochemical performance. To reveal the underlying physical and electrochemical mechanisms, we also process a comparative planar monocrystalline silicon. We find that pre-lithiation results in improved (de-)lithiation behavior, especially in planar silicon-based cells, while silicon nanowire-based cells exhibit low capacity in early cycles. This study sheds light on the surface design and structural modification of monocrystalline silicon nanowires with respect to pre-lithiation by lithium thermal evaporation.

The biomass production efficiency (BPE), defined as the ratio of BP to photosynthesis, and its variation across and within vegetation types is poorly understood, which hinders our capacity to accurately estimate carbon turnover times and carbon sinks. Here, we present a new global estimation of BPE obtained by combining field measurements from 113 sites with 14 carbon cycle models. Our best estimate of global BPE is 0.41 +/- 0.05, excluding cropland. The largest BPE is found in boreal forests (0.48 +/- 0.06) and the lowest in tropical forests (0.40 +/- 0.04). Carbon cycle models overestimate BPE, although models with carbon-nitrogen interactions tend to be more realistic. Using observation-based estimates of global photosynthesis, we quantify the global BP of non-cropland ecosystems of 41 +/- 6 Pg C/year. This flux is less than net primary production as it does not contain carbon allocated to symbionts, used for exudates or volatile carbon compound emissions to the atmosphere. Our study reveals a positive bias of 24 +/- 11% in the model-estimated BP (10 of 14 models). When correcting models for this bias while leaving modeled carbon turnover times unchanged, we found that the global ecosystem carbon storage change during the last century is decreased by 67% (or 58 Pg C).

However, the lack of studies about the natural cooling effects hampers our understanding of vegetation responses to climate change. Using 15,125 ground phenological time series at 3,620 sites since the 1950s and 31-year satellite greenness observations (1982-2012) covering the warming hiatus period, we show a stronger response of leaf onset date (LOD) to natural cooling than to warming, i.e. the delay of LOD caused by 1 degrees C cooling is larger than the advance of LOD with 1 degrees C warming. This might be because cooling leads to larger chilling accumulation and heating requirements for leaf onset, but this non-symmetric LOD response is partially offset by warming-related drying. Moreover, spring greening magnitude, in terms of satellite-based greenness and productivity, is more sensitive to LOD changes in the warming area than in the cooling. These results highlight the importance of considering non-symmetric responses of spring greening to warming and cooling when predicting vegetation-climate feedbacks.

Therefore, soil erosion modelling is one of the steps used to plan suitable soil protection measures and detect erosion hotspots. A bibliometric analysis of this topic can reveal research patterns and soil erosion modelling characteristics that can help identify steps needed to enhance the research conducted in this field. Therefore, a detailed bibliometric analysis, including investigation of collaboration networks and citation patterns, should be conducted. The updated version of the Global Applications of Soil Erosion Modelling Tracker (GASEMT) database contains information about citation characteristics and publication type. Here, we investigated the impact of the number of authors, the publication type and the selected journal on the number of citations. Generalized boosted regression tree (BRT) modelling was used to evaluate the most relevant variables related to soil erosion modelling. Additionally, bibliometric networks were analysed and visualized. This study revealed that the selection of the soil erosion model has the largest impact on the number of publication citations, followed by the modelling scale and the publication's CiteScore. Some of the other GASEMT database attributes such as model calibration and validation have negligible influence on the number of citations according to the BRT model. Although it is true that studies that conduct calibration, on average, received around 30% more citations, than studies where calibration was not performed. Moreover, the bibliographic coupling and citation networks show a clear continental pattern, although the co-authorship network does not show the same characteristics. Therefore, soil erosion modellers should conduct even more comprehensive review of past studies and focus not just on the research conducted in the same country or continent. Moreover, when evaluating soil erosion models, an additional focus should be given to field measurements, model calibration, performance assessment and uncertainty of modelling results. The results of this study indicate that these GASEMT database attributes had smaller impact on the number of citations, according to the BRT model, than anticipated, which could suggest that these attributes should be given additional attention by the soil erosion modelling community. This study provides a kind of bibliographic benchmark for soil erosion modelling research papers as modellers can estimate the influence of their paper.

Roadmap on commercialization of metal halide perovskite photovoltaics	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-MATERIALS												Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) represent one of the most promising emerging photovoltaic technologies due to their high power conversion efficiency. However, despite the huge progress made not only in terms of the efficiency achieved, but also fundamental understanding of the relevant physics of the devices and issues which affect their efficiency and stability, there are still unresolved problems and obstacles on the path toward commercialization of this promising technology. In this roadmap, we aim to provide a concise and up to date summary of outstanding issues and challenges, and the progress made toward addressing these issues. While the format of this article is not meant to be a comprehensive review of the topic, it provides a collection of the viewpoints of the experts in the field, which covers a broad range of topics related to PSC commercialization, including those relevant for manufacturing (scaling up, different types of devices), operation and stability (various factors), and environmental issues (in particular the use of lead). We hope that the article will provide a useful resource for researchers in the field and that it will facilitate discussions and move forward toward addressing the outstanding challenges in this fast-developing field.

Here, we constrain the sensitivity of the terrestrial carbon sink to eCO(2) over the temperate Northern Hemisphere for the past five decades, using 12 terrestrial ecosystem models and data from seven CO2 enrichment experiments. This constraint uses the heuristic finding that the northern temperate carbon sink sensitivity to eCO(2) is linearly related to the site-scale sensitivity across the models. The emerging data-constrained eCO(2) sensitivity is 0.64 +/- 0.28 PgC yr(-1) per hundred ppm of eCO(2). Extrapolating worldwide, this northern temperate sensitivity projects the global terrestrial carbon sink to increase by 3.5 +/- 1.9 PgC yr(-1) for an increase in CO2 of 100 ppm. This value suggests that CO2 fertilization alone explains most of the observed increase in global land carbon sink since the 1960s. More CO2 enrichment experiments, particularly in boreal, arctic and tropical ecosystems, are required to explain further the responsible processes.

For nine regions covering nearly the whole globe, we collected inventory estimates of carbon-stock changes complemented by satellite estimates of biomass changes where inventory data aremissing. The net land-atmospheric carbon exchange (NEE) was calculated by taking the sum of the carbon-stock change and lateral carbon fluxes from crop and wood trade, and riverine-carbon export to the ocean. Summing up NEE from all regions, we obtained a global 'bottom-up' NEE for net land anthropogenic CO2 uptake of -2.2 +/- 0.6 PgC yr(-1) consistent with the independent top-down NEE from the global atmospheric carbon budget during 2000-2009. This estimate is so far the most comprehensive global bottom-up carbon budget accounting, which set up an important milestone for global carbon-cycle studies. By decomposing NEE into component fluxes, we found that global soil heterotrophic respiration amounts to a source of CO2 of 39 PgC yr(-1) with an interquartile of 33-46 PgC yr(-1) -a much smaller portion of net primary productivity than previously reported.

Body size and digestive system shape resource selection by ungulates: A cross-taxa test of the forage maturation hypothesis	ECOLOGY LETTERS												The forage maturation hypothesis (FMH) states that energy intake for ungulates is maximised when forage biomass is at intermediate levels. Nevertheless, metabolic allometry and different digestive systems suggest that resource selection should vary across ungulate species. By combining GPS relocations with remotely sensed data on forage characteristics and surface water, we quantified the effect of body size and digestive system in determining movements of 30 populations of hindgut fermenters (equids) and ruminants across biomes. Selection for intermediate forage biomass was negatively related to body size, regardless of digestive system. Selection for proximity to surface water was stronger for equids relative to ruminants, regardless of body size. To be more generalisable, we suggest that the FMH explicitly incorporate contingencies in body size and digestive system, with small-bodied ruminants selecting more strongly for potential energy intake, and hindgut fermenters selecting more strongly for surface water.

Wayne			An evaluation of nitrogen indicators for soil health in long-term agricultural experiments	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Various soil health indicators that measure a chemically defined fraction of nitrogen (N) or a process related to N cycling have been proposed to quantify the potential to supply N to crops, a key soil function. We evaluated five N indicators (total soil N, autoclavable citrate extractable N, water-extractable organic N, potentially mineralizable N, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity) at 124 sites with long-term experiments across North America evaluating a variety of managements. We found that 59%-81% of the variation in N indicators was among sites, with indicator values decreasing with temperature and increasing with precipitation and clay content. The N indicators increased from 6%-39% in response to decreasing tillage, cover cropping, retaining residue, and applying organic sources of nutrients. Overall, increasing the quantity of organic inputs, whether from increased residue retention, cover cropping, or rotations with higher biomass, resulted in higher values of the N indicators. Although N indicators responded to management in similar ways, the analysis cost and availability of testing laboratories is highly variable. Further, given the strong relationships of the N indicators with carbon (C) indicators, measuring soil organic C along with 24-h potential C mineralization could be used as a proxy for N supply instead of measuring potentially mineralizable N or any other N indicator directly.

S.; Honeycutt, C. Wayne			An evaluation of carbon indicators of soil health in long-term agricultural experiments	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Soil organic carbon (SOC) is closely tied to soil health. However, additional biological indicators may also provide insight about C dynamics and microbial activity. We used SOC and the other C indicators (potential C mineralization, permanganate oxidizable C, water extractable organic C, and beta-glucosidase enzyme activity) from the North American Project to Evaluate Soil Health Measurements to examine the continental-scale drivers of these indicators, the relationships among indicators, and the effects of soil health practices on indicator values. All indicators had greater values at cooler temperatures, and most were greater with increased precipitation and clay content. The indicators were strongly correlated with each other at the site-level, with the strongest relationship between SOC and permanganate oxidizable C. The indicator values responded positively to decreased tillage, inclusion of cover crops, application of organic nutrients, and retention of crop residue, but not the number of harvested crops in a rotation. The effect of decreased tillage on the C indicators was generally greater at sites with higher precipitation. The magnitude and direction of the response to soil health practices was consistent across indicators within a site but measuring at least two indicators would provide additional confi-dence of the effects of management, especially for tillage. All C indicators responded to management, an essential criterion for evaluating soil health. Balancing the cost, sensitivity, interpretability, and availability at commercial labs, a 24-hr potential C mineralization assay could deliver the most benefit to measure in conjunction with SOC.

Yet, few experimental investigations have examined effects of GCDs on plant community structure across multiple ecosystem types, and those that do exist present conflicting patterns. In an unprecedented global synthesis of over 100 experiments that manipulated factors linked to GCDs, we show that herbaceous plant community responses depend on experimental manipulation length and number of factors manipulated. We found that plant communities are fairly resistant to experimentally manipulated GCDs in the short term (< 10 y). In contrast, long-term (>= 10 y) experiments show increasing community divergence of treatments from control conditions. Surprisingly, these community responses occurred with similar frequency across the GCD types manipulated in our database. However, community responses were more common when 3 or more GCDs were simultaneously manipulated, suggesting the emergence of additive or synergistic effects of multiple drivers, particularly over long time periods. In half of the cases, GCD manipulations caused a difference in community composition without a corresponding species richness difference, indicating that species reordering or replacement is an important mechanism of community responses to GCDs and should be given greater consideration when examining consequences of GCDs for the biodiversity-ecosystem function relationship. Human activities are currently driving unparalleled global changes worldwide. Our analyses provide the most comprehensive evidence to date that these human activities may have widespread impacts on plant community composition globally, which will increase in frequency over time and be greater in areas where communities face multiple GCDs simultaneously.

The Soil Health Institute's North America Project to Evaluate Soil Health Measurements measured water content at field capacity using intact soil cores across 124 long-term research sites that contained increases in SOC as a result of management treatments such as reduced tillage and cover cropping. Pedotransfer functions were created for volumetric water content at field capacity (theta(FC)) and permanent wilting point (theta(PWP)). New pedotransfer functions had predictions of theta(AWHC) that were similarly accurate compared with Saxton and Rawls when tested on samples from the National Soil Characterization database. Further, the new pedotransfer functions showed substantial effects of soil calcareousness and SOC on theta(AWHC). For an increase in SOC of 10 g kg(-1) (1%) in noncalcareous soils, an average increase in theta(AWHC) of 3.0 mm 100 mm(-1) soil (0.03 m(3) m(-3)) on average across all soil texture classes was found. This SOC related increase in theta(AWHC) is about double previous estimates. Calcareous soils had an increase in theta(AWHC) of 1.2 mm 100 mm(-1) soil associated with a 10 g kg(-1) increase in SOC, across all soil texture classes. New equations can aid in quantifying benefits of soil management practices that increase SOC and can be used to model the effect of changes in management on drought resilience.

A global database for metacommunity ecology, integrating species, traits, environment and space	SCIENTIFIC DATA												The use of functional information in the form of species traits plays an important role in explaining biodiversity patterns and responses to environmental changes. Although relationships between species composition, their traits, and the environment have been extensively studied on a case-by-case basis, results are variable, and it remains unclear how generalizable these relationships are across ecosystems, taxa and spatial scales. To address this gap, we collated 80 datasets from trait-based studies into a global database for metaCommunity Ecology: Species, Traits, Environment and Space; "CESTES". Each dataset includes four matrices: species community abundances or presences/absences across multiple sites, species trait information, environmental variables and spatial coordinates of the sampling sites. The CESTES database is a live database: it will be maintained and expanded in the future as new datasets become available. By its harmonized structure, and the diversity of ecosystem types, taxonomic groups, and spatial scales it covers, the CESTES database provides an important opportunity for synthetic trait-based research in community ecology.

Wayne			Linking soil microbial community structure to potential carbon mineralization: A continental scale assessment of reduced tillage	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Potential carbon mineralization (Cmin) is a commonly used indicator of soil health, with greater Cmin values interpreted as healthier soil. While Cmin values are typically greater in agricultural soils managed with minimal physical disturbance, the mechanisms driving the increases remain poorly understood. This study assessed bacterial and archaeal community structure and potential microbial drivers of Cmin in soils maintained under various degrees of physical disturbance. Potential carbon mineralization, 16S rRNA sequences, and soil characterization data were collected as part of the North American Project to Evaluate Soil Health Measurements (NAPESHM). Results showed that type of cropping system, intensity of physical disturbance, and soil pH influenced microbial sensitivity to physical disturbance. Furthermore, 28% of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), which were important in modeling Cmin, were enriched under soils managed with minimal physical disturbance. Sequences identified as enriched under minimal disturbance and important for modeling Cmin, were linked to organisms which could produce extracellular polymeric substances and contained metabolic strategies suited for tolerating environmental stressors. Understanding how physical disturbance shapes microbial communities across climates and inherent soil properties and drives changes in Cmin provides the context necessary to evaluate management impacts on standardized measures of soil microbial activity.

Wayne			Evaluation of aggregate stability methods for soil health	GEODERMA												Aggregate stability is a commonly used indicator of soil health because improvements in aggregate stability are related to reduced erodibility and improved soil-water dynamics. During the past 80 to 90 years, numerous methods have been developed to assess aggregate stability. Limited comparisons among the methods have resulted in varied magnitudes of response to soil health management practices and varied influences of inherent soil properties and climate. It is not clear whether selection of a specific method creates any advantage to the investigator. This study assessed four commonly used methods of measuring aggregate stability using data collected as part of the North American Project to Evaluate Soil Health Measurements. The methods included water stable aggregates using the Cornell Rainfall Simulator (WSACASH), wet sieved water stable aggregates (WSAARS), slaking captured and adapted from SLAKES smart-phone image recognition software (STAB10), and the mean weight diameter of water stable aggregates (MWD). Influence of climate and inherent soil prop-erties at the continental scale were analyzed in addition to method responses to rotation diversity, cash crop count, residue management, organic nutrient amendments, cover crops, and tillage. The four methods were moderately correlated with each other. All methods were sensitive to differences in climate and inherent soil properties between sites, although to different degrees. None measured significant effects from rotation diversity or crop count, but all methods detected significant increases in aggregate stability resulting from reduced tillage. Significant increases or positive trends were observed for all methods in relation to cover cropping, increased residue retention, and organic amendments, except for STAB10, which expressed a slightly negative response to organic amendments. Considering these results, no single method was clearly superior and all four are viable options for measuring aggregate stability. Therefore, secondary considerations (e.g., cost, method availability, increased sensitivity to a specific management practice, or minimal within-treatment variability) driven by the needs of the investigator, should determine the most suitable method.

Wayne			Selecting soil hydraulic properties as indicators of soil health: Measurement response to management and site characteristics	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Farmers, scientists, and other soil health stakeholders require interpretable indicators of soil hydraulic function. Determining which indicators to use has been difficult because of measurement disconformity, spatial and temporal variability, recently established treatments, and the effect of site characteristics on management practice differences. The North American Project to Evaluate Soil Health Measurements includes 124 sites uniformly sampled across a range of soil health management practices in North America in 2019. We compare and recommend indicators of hydraulic function that best characterize soil health. We assessed the relationship of each indicator to a suite of soil inherent properties and climate variables, the response of each indicator to soil health management practices, the effect that soil inherent properties (clay content, sand content, and pH) and climatic variables (10-yr mean annual precipitation and temperature) had on response to management practices, and the relationship among the responses of the indicators to soil health management practices. Field capacity measured on intact cores (theta(FC_INTACT)) was the best measure of soil hydraulic function, because it responded to management, represents a direct measure of soil hydraulic function, is proximal to stakeholder values, and its response to management was not significantly influenced by inherent and climatic variables. Other suitable indicators are bulk density, soil organic carbon (SOC), and aggregate stability, which are not direct measures of soil hydraulic function but do respond to management and may be practical in situations in which measuring theta(FC_INTACT) is not. This study informs selection of soil health indicators to measure soil hydraulic function.

Using the GrassPlot database, we provide benchmarks of fine-grain richness values of Palaearctic open habitats for vascular plants, bryophytes, lichens and complete vegetation (i.e., the sum of the former three groups). Location Palaearctic biogeographic realm. Methods We used 126,524 plots of eight standard grain sizes from the GrassPlot database: 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 m(2) and calculated the mean richness and standard deviations, as well as maximum, minimum, median, and first and third quartiles for each combination of grain size, taxonomic group, biome, region, vegetation type and phytosociological class. Results Patterns of plant diversity in vegetation types and biomes differ across grain sizes and taxonomic groups. Overall, secondary (mostly semi-natural) grasslands and natural grasslands are the richest vegetation type. The open-access file "GrassPlot Diversity Benchmarks" and the web tool "GrassPlot Diversity Explorer" are now available online () and provide more insights into species richness patterns in the Palaearctic open habitats. Conclusions The GrassPlot Diversity Benchmarks provide high-quality data on species richness in open habitat types across the Palaearctic. These benchmark data can be used in vegetation ecology, macroecology, biodiversity conservation and data quality checking. While the amount of data in the underlying GrassPlot database and their spatial coverage are smaller than in other extensive vegetation-plot databases, species recordings in GrassPlot are on average more complete, making it a valuable complementary data source in macroecology.
