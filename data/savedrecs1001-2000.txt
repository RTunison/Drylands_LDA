Vertical rotary subsoiling (VRT) has been shown to effectively increase soil water storage and so allow crops to resist seasonal drought. However, there is a lack of reports on the infiltration path and distribution pattern of rainwater in soil under VRT practice. The present study used simulated rainfall and visualized the soil profile water distribution and path of VRT, subsoiling tillage (SS) and conventional tillage (CT) practices. Twenty-four hours after applying simulated rain, vertical soil profiles were photographed and staining features used to indicate the infiltration path and distribution of rainwater in the soil. Our results showed that when rainwater infiltrated into the soil, matrix and preferential flows occurred concomitantly under VRT practice, and mainly matrix flow for SS and CT practices. The VRT increased water infiltration into the soil, occurrence of preferential flow and water storage in the soil profile, while the soil of SS and CT somewhat hindered the infiltration of water. The VRT decreased soil bulk density (BD) by 9.2-10.3 % and increased soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) by 50.4-70.4 % compared with SS and CT. Moreover, VRT significantly increased potato tuber yield by 22.9-36.0 % compared with SS and CT in two consecutive years. Structural equation modeling (SEM) further revealed that VRT increased potato yield was mainly caused by decreasing BD and increasing K-s, and then increasing water storage in the soil profile. These findings suggest that decreased BD and increased K-s in VRT practice could be particularly important for infiltration, sustaining and supplying of soil water in rainfed areas worldwide, which is important for production practices in these areas.

However, large extensions of biocrusts are disturbed by human activities, gypsum quarry being an outstanding example. Restoration techniques applied have offered satisfactory results for vascular plants but they could greatly differ in promoting biocrust recovery. A basic question remains unaddressed: can measures for plant recovery accelerate or promote the recovery of biological crusts? We have examined eight different situations: undisturbed natural habitat, five treatments with no restoration measures (overgrazed area, abandoned quarry, topsoil removal from natural habitat, and two areas filled with gypsum mining spoil), and 2 areas receiving restoration measures (manual sowing and hydroseeding). We took 40 soil cores to determine cover of lichen, moss, and cyanobacteria. Biocrust richness and cover were higher in the undisturbed habitat, with remarkable differences for the different components among treatments. Cyanobacteria were well represented in all the cores (restored and non-restored). Mosses were promoted the most by hydroseeding. Lichen cover was remarkably higher in undisturbed samples, very low in the quarry abandoned in 1992, and 0 in the rest. Complete spontaneous recovery of biocrusts was inefficient in the 25-year period examined. Plant restoration measures could speed up its recovery comparing with non-restored areas. Cyanobacteria and mosses can spontaneously recover fairly well. However, promoting them would accelerate the appearance of lichen. For lichen, inoculation or translocation of lichen thalli might be proposed. Therefore, our results call for the inclusion of active restoration measures of biocrust components in recovery plans, especially for lichens.

The effects of five different types of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), including Fla-wheat (F), Barvar-2 (B), Nitroxin (N1), Nitrokara (N2), and SWRI, and their integration with chemical fertilizers (50% and/or 100% need-based N, P, and Zn) on the quantitative and qualitative traits of a rainfed wheat cultivar were investigated. Field experiments, in the form of randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four replications, were conducted at the Qamloo Dryland Agricultural Research Station in Kurdistan Province, Iran, in three cropping seasons (2016-2017, 2017-2018, and 2018-2019). All the investigated characteristics of rainfed wheat were significantly affected by the integrated application of PGPR chemical fertilizers. The grain yield of treated plants with F, B, N1, and N2 PGPR plus 50% of need-based chemical fertilizers was increased by 28%, 28%, 37%, and 33%, respectively, compared with the noninoculated control. Compared with the noninoculated control, the grain protein content was increased by 0.54%, 0.88%, and 0.34% through the integrated application of F, N1, and N2 PGPR plus 50% of need-based chemical fertilizers, respectively. A combination of Nitroxin PGPR and 100% of need-based chemical fertilizers was the best treatment to increase the grain yield (56%) and grain protein content (1%) of the Azar-2 rainfed wheat cultivar. The results of this 3-year field study showed that the integrated nutrient management of PGPR-need-based N, P, and Zn chemical fertilizers can be considered a crop management tactic to increase the yield and quality of rainfed wheat and reduce chemical fertilization and subsequent environmental pollution and could be useful in terms of sustainable rainfed crop production.

Precision variable rate nitrogen for dryland farming on waterlogging Riverine Plains of Southeast Australia?	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												Precision agriculture, using satellite navigation, has grown in popularity around the world. Because of its practical uses for land preparation, sowing, nutrient applications, pest (weed, pathogen, invertebrate) management, stress sensing and harvest recording, many major equipment manufacturers include precision variable rate capability as standard fittings. GIS (Geographic Information System) maps may include georeferenced soil chemistry information and detailed historical harvest yield data. We integrate such data to examine Precision Variable Rate Nitrogen (PVRN) applications with whole-farm management information and rainfall records in a district where waterlogging frequently reduces crop yields. Given wide variations in growing season rainfalls (GSR) and soils in the district, we test year-to-year stability of rainfed crop-yield rankings over time on 90x90m GIS grid-areas in large paddocks (over 100 ha). Variations in historical yield-quartile rankings of grid-areas across GSR levels over time are observed; some areas yield best at some GSR levels but not others, such that the best-yielding part of a paddock one year may be poorest in the next. We answer the question: "Why would a farmer in this district choose to apply a uniform moderate rate of N to a paddock at sowing even though in possession of precision variable rate-capable (PVR) equipment, georeferenced electromagnetic conductance (EM38) data and crop-yield map data for that paddock in many past seasons?" We show that soil conditions in the study district challenge the economic value of PVRN versus uniform rates in farming systems prone to waterlogging. If full-season GSR were reliably predictable early in the season, applications of N could be based on a rule calling for 40 kg/ha N/t of attainable yield at that GSR and grid-area EM38 level, minus sampled soil-N. Unfortunately, GSR is notoriously unpredictable. We simulate whole-farm financial risk profiles (CDFs of simulated decadal cash margins with varying prices and yields, minus all variable, fixed and capital costs) assuming moderate uniform N rates, as practiced in the study area, on two model farms; one with low and one with high-fixed-costs, given historical variations in GSR and prices. Assuming PVRN requires annual geo-referenced soil nutrient sampling of each hectare, these added costs could be covered by a 1% increase in yields across all wheat and canola crops or a 7% decrease in applied N. We cannot reject the null hypothesis that PVRN is no more profitable than uniform applications in this district. Near-real-time NDVI may lower the cost of PVRN for late applications.

C.			Woody Plant Encroachment has a Larger Impact than Climate Change on Dryland Water Budgets	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Woody plant encroachment (WPE) into grasslands is a global phenomenon that is associated with land degradation via xerification, which replaces grasses with shrubs and bare soil patches. It remains uncertain how the global processes of WPE and climate change may combine to impact water availability for ecosystems. Using a process-based model constrained by watershed observations, our results suggest that both xerification and climate change augment groundwater recharge by increasing channel transmission losses at the expense of plant available water. Conversion from grasslands to shrublands without creating additional bare soil, however, reduces transmission losses. Model simulations considering both WPE and climate change are used to assess their relative roles in a late 21st century condition. Results indicate that changes in focused channel recharge are determined primarily by the WPE pathway. As a result, WPE should be given consideration when assessing the vulnerability of groundwater aquifers to climate change.

However, the interpretation of these responses through space and time has been challenging due to the limitation of satellite-derived inundation extent, which is restricted by the return period of imagery and prevalence of clouds affected images during high flow events. We address this issue by utilising a predictive inundation model capable of reporting inundation at daily temporal resolution. Spatio-temporal patterns in vegetation greenness of four floodplain vegetation communities (Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Eucalyptus largiflorens, Eucalyptus coolabah and Duma florulenta) were quantified using Landsat-derived vegetation index and a combination of time series of floodplain inundation pattern, rainfall and soil moisture for the years 1989-2016. The results show that vegetation dynamics were highly variable between years and are closely associated with irregular rainfall patterns and overbank flooding. Linear mixed-effect models explained between 38% and 67% of the variability in vegetation productivity, with all involved variables being significant predictors (p < 0.05). The effects of rainfall, soil moisture and inundation were diverse and depended on vegetation type. Higher inundation frequency and low interflood period often corresponded to lower vegetation responses, which may relate to a mixed surface water and vegetation signal, or a short-term inhibitive effect of surface water on growth. These results highlight the importance of groundwater and lagged effects of rainfall and flow in explaining patterns of vegetation condition in semi-arid floodplains and should be considered in the design of environmental water monitoring programmes.

Here, we conducted a meta-analysis across China's grasslands to address these questions. Our results suggested that different grazing intensities (low grazing (LG), medium grazing (MG) and high grazing (HG)) were closely related to plant biomass, soil physicochemical properties, soil microbial and enzyme activities. Specifically, MG significantly increased below-ground biomass (BGB). HG apparently decreased soil microbial activities, soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN), while LG showed the opposite results. The grazing-induced changes in plant biomass, soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen might be the main underlying drivers that control the responses of SOC and TN to grazing intensities. The findings highlighted that LG was suitable for the sustainable development of China's grasslands and even worldwide dryland management.

Carbon turnover time (CTT) and carbon uptake are the key indicators that determine the C dynamics and the potential C sequestration, but it has not been well quantified in a specific ecosystem. Our study combined a field inventory in a desert steppe ecosystem with data synthesis and the Terrestrial Ecosystem Regional model (TECO-R) for desert steppes to invert the key parameters of the ecosystem's carbon cycle. The average CTT in the leaf, root, and soil carbon pools (to a depth of 50 cm) and for the whole ecosystem was 1.43, 10.1, 76.96, and 37.65 years, respectively. The study area's net primary productivity (NPP) averaged 131.93 g C M-2 yr(-1) from 2000 to 2018 based on the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach, and the ecosystem C uptake averaged 28.86 g C M-2 yr(-1), driven by an increasing NPP trend. The whole-ecosystem CTT (CTTE) increased significantly, by about 6 years per 25-mm increase in precipitation, 0.45 degrees increase in latitude, 1000-g increase in SOC, and 50-g C m(-2) yr(-1) increase in NPP. The threshold temperature for CTT in the desert steppe was around 6 degrees C. CTTE was significantly negatively correlated with temperature above this temperature, but below this value is the opposite. However, the pattern of ecosystem potential C uptake was affected by climate, NPP, and the intensity of human activities, with no clearly dominant factor. These analyses of the desert steppe's carbon cycle will help to improve the assessment of dryland carbon dynamics and global carbon budgets.

Pot experiments for the whole life cycle in fifteen genotypes and comparative metabolomics analysis for seedlings between two drought tolerant (DT) dryland genotypes and two drought sensitive (DS) irrigated ones were carried out. The DT dryland genotypes suffered heavy biomass loss during severer drought but showed minor yield loss ultimately, while the DS irrigated ones showed minor biomass loss but greater yield loss. Additionally, the superior DT dryland genotypes showed better yield performance under both drought stress and well-watered conditions, indicating their possessing both drought tolerance and high yield potential traits. Suffering severer drought stress, seedling leaves of the DS irrigated genotypes increased some amino acids and organic acids to maintain cell metabolism and accumulate more biomass. Proline in particular was overproduced, which might cause toxicity to cell systems and lead to enormous yield loss ultimately. In contrast, DT dryland genotypes increased the beneficial amino acid and phenolic acids to enhance cell self-protection for alleviating drought damage and efficiently minimized yield loss ultimately.

We investigated the relationships between (i) grain yield and yield-component traits, (ii) grain yield and yield stability, and (iii) reproductive (R) and vegetative (V) biomass in a field experiment with 18 spring wheat genotypes varying from landraces to recently-released breeding lines in a semiarid region under three different levels of precipitation. Genotypic differences in grain yield varied with the environment. The relationship between grain yield and yield components was also dependent on the environment, making it difficult to identify early-screening parameters for use in breeding programs. A genotype main effects and genotype by environment interaction effect analysis (GGE) showed a negative relationship between mean grain yield and yield stability across environments. There were significant differences among genotypes in the allometric exponent of the R-V relationship (slope of the log R - log V relationship). For the three highest yielding but less stable genotypes, this slope value was 1, while the five lowest yielding, but more stable genotypes, it was < 1. We hypothesize that the tradeoff between grain yield and yield stability reported here is biologically constrained and cannot be eliminated through breeding. Therefore, a balance between yield stability and high yield should be considered in future wheat breeding programs for smallholder farmers, rather than attempting to improve both.

It is an analysis of the emerging smallholder cotton irrigation agriculture and the contradictions between this process and the labour requirements of the estate sector. The article argues that, once the main irrigation estate was established, the Gowe plot-holders, who until 1974 had existed as a quasi-autonomous unit (overseeing their own labour needs), then served as the estate's major manual labour repository. At the core of the article is the interesting tripartite tension between a state-run cotton estate, a group of associated plot-holders (later outgrowers) benefiting from land and irrigation arrangements and a farming community at large.																			0305-7070	1465-3893				SEP 14	2022	48	3					453	472		10.1080/03057070.2022.2077019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03057070.2022.2077019		MAY 2022											WOS:000807053600001

This is true for institutionally complex communities as well as small-scale societies that have existed in semi-arid regions throughout the Holocene. This paper examines some of the successful strategies employed by small-scale mobile communities which enhanced their ability to thrive in drylands over the course of thousands of years. Small-scale societies living in drylands must rely on the transmission of Traditional Ecological Knowledge across generations. Some of this knowledge relates to the availability and use of wetlands and other more ephemeral water sources, the exploitation of a diverse range of resources, and the potential for natural storage of food resources as a buffer against regularly occurring drought years in these regions. We compare this understanding with our environmental archeological findings at the Mid-Holocene site of Zaraa Uul in the eastern Gobi Desert of Mongolia. At the site of Zaraa Uul, we show how hunter-gatherer groups returned to a campsite near the edge of a wetland environment over the course of at least two phases during the Mid-Holocene. Here they took advantage of a greater diversity of animal species and plants, including small-grained-grasses and sedges, which could enhance their caloric intake and increase the potential for storable commodities which could be collected as needed from their natural habitat.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				DEC	2022	32	12			SI		1462	1476		10.1177/09596836221121777	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836221121777		SEP 2022											WOS:000852313400001

No-tillage and fertilizer-nitrogen improved sorghum yield in dryland wheat-sorghum- fallow rotation	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Grain crop rotations are common in temperate semiarid regions, but the effect of long-term tillage and fertilizer-nitrogen (N) rate interaction on sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench ssp. Bicolor) grain yield in a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-sorghum-fallow rotation is not well understood. This study was conducted from 2015 to 2020 using long-term plots established in 1965. Experimental design was randomized complete block with split-plot arrangement of treatments. Main plots were conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT), and no-tillage (NT), and subplots treatments were 0, 45, 90, and 135 kg N ha-1. Tillage x N rate and year x tillage x N rate interactions had no effect on grain yield, but yield was greatest with NT in 2016 and unaffected by tillage in other years. The year x N rate had significant effect on grain yield because of no response to N fertilizer in 2015 and greater responses from 2018 to 2020. Across years and tillage treatments, mean grain yield increased quadratically by 52%, 70%, and 83% as N rate increased from 0 to 45, 90, and 135 kg ha-1, respectively. On average, grain yield, N agronomic efficiency (NAE), and grain N recovery efficiency (GNRE) were 6%, 20%, and 15% greater, respectively, under NT compared with CT and RT. Quadratic models explained yield response to N rate and growing season pre-cipitation for each tillage practice. Grain yield increases per growing season precipitation were 22.9, 14.9, and 11.9 kg ha-1 mm-1 with NT, CT, and RT, respectively. Fertilizer-N application increased sorghum grain yield and protein concentration, but NAE and GNRE decreased beyond 45 kg ha-1 N. In conclusion, NT is the best management practice to increase grain sorghum yield, NAE, and NRE in nonirrigated winter wheat-sorghum-fallow rotations.																			0022-4561	1941-3300				NOV-DEC	2022	77	6					609	618		10.2489/jSWC.2022.00241	http://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jSWC.2022.00241													WOS:000887147800006

Fallow is associated with several challenges including low precipitation storage efficiency, depletion of soil organic carbon (SOC), loss of soil fertility, little crop residue retention and soil erosion, and few control options for herbicide-resistant (HR) weeds. The inability to effectively control HR weeds poses a major challenge to maintaining soil and water conservation practices such as no-tillage, as some producers are considering tillage to control weeds. Cover crop (CC) integration into wheat-based production systems to replace portions of the fallow period provides an opportunity to increase SOC, improve soil fertility, suppress weeds, and increase profitability of dryland crop production, especially when CCs are used as forage. This forum paper used the North American Great Plains as a model region to review information on (a) challenges of dryland agriculture; (b) integrating CCs in dryland agriculture; (c) benefits, challenges, and limitations of CCs in dryland crop production; (d) management options for CC integration in dryland grain systems; and (e) recommendations for future research efforts.

Mulch more so than compost improves soil health to reestablish vegetation in a semiarid rangeland	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Up to half of the world's drylands have degraded, dysfunctional soils that lower success rates of restoration efforts to reestablish lost vegetation. Because soil amendments of organic matter have the potential to improve multiple ecosystem functions and overall soil health, we added a mulch of whole mesquite (Prosopis velutina) branches-both alone and in combination with 3 and 6 cm of compost-to a degraded semiarid rangeland. We then measured effects of these organic amendments on a suite of soil health indicators as well as plant cover and abundance. We found that surface applications of these amendments improved several indicators of soil health after two summer growing seasons. Soil temperature decreased and soil moisture increased in all treatments with organic amendments. However, during drier times of the year and in response to smaller rain events, mulch alone increased soil moisture more so than when combined with compost. As expected, total soil nitrogen was greatest with compost addition. Soil organic carbon, water-stable aggregate size, and microbial abundance did not respond significantly to any treatment. Mesquite mulch increased native plant cover and abundance when applied without compost and increased plant cover when combined with 3 cm of compost, but it did not increase plant abundance or cover when combined with 6 cm of compost. Collectively, these results suggest that a thin layer of compost-but particularly woody branches used as mulch-can improve success rates of revegetation in dryland ecosystems by moderating the soil microclimate.

This study employs the patch-level land use simulation model to forecast changes in various land-use types in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China, between 2020 and 2060 under different climatic conditions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has proposed shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) as potential socioeconomic and environmental trajectories that might influence the region's future land-use patterns. Three salient findings emerged: (1) LULC displayed considerable variation across future climate scenarios, with a notable rise in forest and grassland cover and a marked decrease in cropland areas under the SSP126 scenario. Conversely, the SSP585 scenario witnessed a substantial cropland expansion, paralleled by a decrease in forest and grassland areas; (2) CS exhibited significant disparities across different future climate scenarios. Xinjiang achieved a peak CS of 9.81 Pg between 2020 and 2060 under the SSP126 scenario, marking an increase of 335.22 Tg in 2060 compared to that in 2020. The SSP585 scenario registered the lowest CS at 9.41 Pg, indicating a decline of 50.07 Tg in 2060 relative to 2020; (3) The impacts of longitude and latitude on CS in Xinjiang predominantly arose from shifts in forest area and vegetation cover based on latitude, which positively influenced CS. In contrast, a decrease in vegetation cover and a subsequent decline in CS were evident with increasing longitude, particularly in the Altai, Tianshan, and Kunlun Mountains. These findings hold significant implications for formulating CS management strategies for terrestrial ecosystems and enhancing ecological preservation in Xinjiang.

However, it is a critical issue how residual plastic type and thickness affect soil properties and crop yield. To address this issue, in situ landfill was conducted using thick polyethylene (PEt1), thin polyethylene (PEt2), thick biodegradable (BIOt1), thin biodegradable (BIOt2) residues, and CK (control) with no residues landfill in a semiarid maize field. The findings demonstrated that the impact of various treatments on soil characteristics and maize yield varied considerably. Soil water content decreased by 24.82% in PEt1 and 25.43% in PEt2, compared to BIOt1 and BIOt2, respectively. BIOt2 treatment increased soil bulk density by 1.31 g cm 3 and lowered soil porosity by 51.11%, respectively; it also elevated the silt/clay proportion by 49.42% relative to CK. In contrast, microaggregate composition in PEt2 was higher (43.02%). Moreover, BIOt2 lowered soil nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+) content. Compared with other treatments, BIOt2 resulted in significantly higher soil total nitrogen (STN) and lower SOC/STN. Finally, BIOt2 exhibited the lowest water use efficiency (WUE) (20.57 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)) and yield (6896 kg ha(-1)) among all the treatments. Therefore, BIO film residues exhibited detrimental impacts on soil quality and maize productivity compared to PE film ones. Considering film thickness, thin residual films more evidently influenced soil quality and maize productivity than thick film ones.					wang, KiKi/JFZ-3334-2023; zhao, weiwei/JUU-6585-2023; wang, jiaqi/JSL-7112-2023; zhang, jiayue/JUF-0129-2023; FENG, X/JPL-4188-2023; Wang, Xingyu/JNE-0602-2023; 周, 睿/HOA-5317-2023; Li, Huizhen/JPX-2563-2023	Zhao, Ze-Ying/0000-0003-2312-6178; Zhou, Rui/0000-0001-6072-8464													0045-6535	1879-1298				JUL	2023	329								138602	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.138602	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.138602		APR 2023						37028722					WOS:000981682400001

Mapping individual tree and plot-level biomass using airborne and mobile lidar in pin?on-juniper woodlands	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Pin similar to on-juniper (PJ) woodlands are a widespread dryland ecosystem in the US containing an immense but poorlyconstrained amount of aboveground biomass (AGB). Found at the dry end of the climatic range within which trees can persist, PJ faces an uncertain future in a changing climate, giving unique importance to mapping its AGB, past, present, and future. Lidar remote sensing offers great potential towards that end with research in a range of tree-dominant ecosystems demonstrating a strong capacity for mapping AGB. However, studies applying lidar to the task of mapping AGB in PJ are few. Given the unique structural characteristics of PJ trees, which tend to be short in stature (<10 m), possess multiple stems often obscured by low crown base heights, and irregularlyshaped canopies, there remains a high degree of uncertainty surrounding tree- and stand-level structural mapping in these woodlands. To resolve our limited understanding of how to best quantify AGB in PJ using lidar, we conducted a field-validated analysis comparing lidar platform (airborne laser scanner, ALS vs. mobile laser scanner, MLS) and analytical framework (area-based modeling vs. individual tree-based modeling). We used a random forest machine learning approach to predicting tree- and stand-level structure with leave-one-out crossvalidation to assess model performance. In an area-based context, MLS only marginally outperformed ALS, with both able to explain approximately 80 % of variance in AGB. However, in an individual tree-based context, MLS significantly outperforms ALS at several tasks, including: (1) delineating tree crowns (MLS delineated 100 % of trees; ALS delineated 69 %); (2) directly characterizing tree structural parameters including height (R2ALS = 0.52 vs. R2MLS = 0.74) and crown area (R2ALS = 0.26 vs. R2MLS = 0.68); and (3) modeling AGB (R2ALS = 0.38 vs. R2MLS = 0.62). We attribute this difference in performance to the vastly greater structural detail contained within the MLS point cloud data as compared to ALS, with the former possessing an average of approximately 30,000 pts/m2 and the latter 14 pts/m2. Based on our results, we make the following recommendation: if individual tree structure is needed, MLS is the far superior option; however, given the wider availability, ALS data are a suitable substitute when mapping PJ AGB, particularly under an area-based modeling analytical framework. This study represents the first time MLS data have been applied to tree structure mapping in PJ, and provides strong quantitative evidence towards best structural and AGB mapping practices in this unique, widespread, and important ecosystem. It serves as a solid foundation upon which future studies aiming to map AGB in PJ and other similar dryland woodland ecosystems can be built.

To date, most analyses have occurred at regional levels, and derived insight through surveys, remote sensing, or small scale targeted case studies. Here, we provide an analysis based on a survey of 250 fields from 2015 to 2018 inclusive. Biotic factors, nutrients and crop yields are all monitored. Crop models were calibrated locally at each site. Regression and Classification Trees (RCART) were used to determine the key drivers of the yield gap in wheat, and again used to identify attributes contributing to a yield gap for a field regardless of crop type. The mean yield gap from 697 wheat crops, collected over 4 years, was 1.03 t/ha (MSE = 2.23 t/ha). This equated to a mean wheat yield gap of 20.3 % +/- S.D 36.2 %. 18 % of fields had repeated yield gaps of 20 % or more, irrespective of crop type. The RCART analysis demonstrated that for wheat, the yield potential of the crop was the most important predictor, where fields with high yield potentials were most likely to have a higher yield gap. Nitrogen was the second most important predictor. Yield gaps of wheat crops grown in high yielding regions were also related to crop rotation, leaf diseases and weed populations. In low rainfall zones, wheat yield gaps were related to the presence of soil pathogens including Pratylenchus sp., Pythium sp. and Fusarium sp. In conclusion, yield potential and nitrogen are important predictors of the yield gap. Increasing nitrogen inputs would address the yield gap in 25 % of wheat crops. In 22 % of wheat crops, increasing nitrogen inputs will not correct the gap, as other biotic stresses are often present, that require sophisticated agronomic intervention. In the remaining 53 % of wheat fields yield gaps were less than 0.37 t/ha.

However, there are several constraints to the sector's development, including negative impacts of climate change. To mitigate these impacts, farmers implement a range of technical strategies. The extent of farmer's awareness and perceptions of climate change impacts influences these strategies and hence farmers' level of adaptation. This study was undertaken to assess farmers' awareness and perceptions of climate change impacts in Aguie Department, Niger Republic. Descriptive statistics and a regression model were used for data analysis. The results from a descriptive analysis show that the majority of respondents (84.4%) were aware of climate risks, but had differing perceptions of climate change impacts on production and annual revenue. A regression test revealed that climate-related information is highly significant in determining farmers' awareness of climate change impacts. Most of the respondents reported negative impacts from climate change, and the majority, therefore, adjusted their farming system, albeit at different levels. A probit analysis shows that awareness, perception, education, crop production, soil fertility and annual revenue are highly influential on farmers' climate change impacts adaptation. This research highlights farmer awareness and perceptions as key factors in the climate change impacts adaptation debate. The findings reveal that effective adaptation to climate change impacts is highly dependent on the extent of community awareness and how farmers perceive the impacts of climate change. The study highlights that institutions targeting households' livelihood improvement and making decisions concerning climate change adaptation need to focus on media outreach in local languages, improving locally adapted extension services, and developing water use efficiency measures such as improved irrigation for effective and long-term adaptation.

However, the status of wood fuel producers' livelihood capital and their vulnerability is poorly understood in the drylands of Ethiopia. The main purpose of the research is to characterize the livelihoods of firewood and charcoal producers as well as identify sources of livelihoods' vulnerability in the dryland areas of the country. These urge to transit for sustainable energy use. The study used survey data collected from 857 sampled wood fuel producer households and Focus Group Discussions. The data were analyzed descriptively using livelihood measurement indicators and livelihood vulnerability indexes (exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity indicators) in the context of farming, agro-pastoralist, and pastoralist communities. Results indicated that generally financial, human, and social capital of wood fuel producers were low whereas natural and physical capital were better. Results also indicated engagement in the production of wood fuel strengthened the producers' livelihood capital and delivered other benefits such as opportunities for livelihood diversification as well as reducing vulnerability and improved livelihoods. The pastoral and agro-pastoral communities' livelihood capital sources were more vulnerable than farming communities. The study has also identified that wood fuel production was one of the major coping strategies employed by the sampled households to mitigate the effects of different shocks. Finally, the study results implied that wood fuel production is the highest priority area of intervention to improve the livelihoods of communities in the dry lands. It is also worthwhile to establish sustainable approaches for wood fuel production keeping the dry land forest and environment safe. This calls policy for a just transition toward an equitable wood fuel production system with the potential to deliver sustainable energy and rural development through the incorporation of wood fuel importance to rural livelihoods.																				2571-581X				OCT 20	2022	6								966137	10.3389/fsufs.2022.966137	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2022.966137													WOS:000879958300001

The adequate management of this silvo-pastoral ecosystem requires good understanding of the effect of factors such as tree canopy, fertilization and soil amendment on pasture growth. The main objectives of this work were: (1) to evaluate the effect of tree canopy on soil characteristics and pasture productivity and quality; and (2) to test floristic composition assessment as a bio-indicator of soil improvements (amendment and fertilization) in each study area (under and outside tree canopy). Topsoil was characterized at the beginning of the project (October 2015) and at the end of the experiments (spring 2020). Soil parameters obtained by electronic sensors (soil moisture content, soil cone index and surface temperature) were monitored monthly during the 2017/2018 pasture vegetative cycle. Pasture productivity, quality and floristic composition were evaluated every two years (2016, 2018 and 2020) in the spring flowering period. The results of the floristic inventory were submitted to a multilevel pattern analysis (Indicator Species Analysis, ISA). Pasture biodiversity was evaluated based on the calculation of richness indices. This study showed a positive effect of tree canopy on soil fertility and pasture quality (e.g., CP). Pasture productivity, on the other hand, was higher in areas outside tree canopy. The great potential of ISA as a tool for identification of bio-indicator species was also demonstrated. Pasture species were identified as ecological and dynamic attributes characteristic of each study area, before and after soil amendment and fertilization.

The study was carried out during 2017-18 in purposively selected villages of Ananthapur district of Andhra Pradesh. A sample of 120 (farmers) and 30 (mixed group of scientist's, NGOs activist and other experts) were selected randomly on the basis of the presence of and association with functional water sharing groups (WSGs). For critical analysis, a combination of focused group discussions, case study and Delphi technique accompanied by knowledge index, adoption index, multiple regression, correlation and factor analysis were used. It was found that only 20 users owned bore wells and shared with 100 farmers who did not own any bore wells. CWMI were well accepted and integrated into the culture of the dryland farmers as they comprehensively understood the agro-ecological bases for their survival and sustenance in dry land areas. 14 factors were deduced for agro ecological crises, Majority (63.33%) of farmers possessed high level of knowledge about the agro-ecological reasons behind the CWMIs and 60.83% of farmers had high (70-86%) extent of adoption of all the CWMIs and 65.8% of farmers had adopted 12 out of the 14 different practices. Need for synergy and convergence among researchers, administrations, line departments, NGOs, extension system were felt as the facilitative factors for diffusing CWMIs.

In-situ carbon flux data are also valuable in developing remote sensing-based models for extrapolation of biome-specific carbon budgets to higher spatial scales. In this study, net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange (NEE) was continuously measured for two years (2017 and 2018) from a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) field in College Station, Texas, USA. The measured NEE was partitioned into assimilatory (Gross Primary Production, GPP) and respiratory (Ecosystem respiration, R-eco) fluxes. There were substantial differences in carbon fluxes between the two years, which were driven by variations in meteorological conditions and growth of weeds. Due to dry conditions, growing season carbon uptake in 2018 was reduced (883 g C m(-2)) compared to 2017 (947 g C m(-2)). While the growing season of 2018 was dry, the postharvest off-season was remarkably wet with nearly 68% of the annual precipitation occurring after harvest (848 mm). This favored aggressive growth of weeds, resulting in substantial off-season carbon uptake in 2018 (374 g C m(-2) in 2018 compared to 100 g C m(-2) in 2017). Overall, the site was a net carbon source (175 g C m(-2)) in 2017, whereas it was a slight carbon sink (-5 g C m(-2)) in 2018. A significant correlation was found between satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and GPP (R-2 0.78 in 2017 and 0.72 in 2018). Given that correlation, it would be possible to broaden these results to the wider region by estimating GPP with satellite data.

The objective was to measure changes of inoculated soybean plants grown under regular field Brazilian production conditions. The experiment was carried out to compare 5 inoculation treatments: T1 (Bradyrhizobium japonicum and B. diazoefficiens), T2 (T1 and Azospirillum brasilense), T3 (T1 and Trichoderma asperellum), T4 (T1 and T. virens, and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens) and T5 (T1 and Penicillum bilaiae). Leaf area, shoot and root dry matter were measured at vegetative and reproductive growth stages. Results of this study validate the contribution of plant growth analysis of soybeans plants for identifying their responses promoted by the combined inoculation of their seeds with selected microbes. Also, the microbial effects on plant growth vary not only between microbes but also between parts of the plants and through the plant development stages. The introduction of different microbes in soybean rhizosphere combined with Bradyrhizobium sp. strains can contribute to increase crop dry matter productivity during its growing cycle.

Soil bacterial community response to cover crop introduction in a wheat-based dryland cropping system	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS												The incorporation of cover crops into cropping systems is important for enhancing soil health in agricultural systems. Soil microbes contribute to soil health by supplying key nutrients and providing protection against plant pests, diseases, and abiotic stress. While research has demonstrated the connection between cover crops and the soil microbiology, less is known regarding the impact of cover crops on the soil microbial community in semi-arid regions of the Northern Great Plains. Our objectives were to evaluate changes in the soil bacterial community composition and community networks in wheat grown after multi-species cover crops. Cover crops were compared to continuous cropping and crop/fallow systems and the effects of cover crop termination methods were also evaluated. Cover crops consisted of a cool season multispecies mix, mid-season multispecies mix, and a warm season multispecies mix, which were grown in rotation with winter wheat. A continuous cropping (wheat/barley) and wheat/fallow system were also included along with cover crop termination by grazing, herbicide application, and haying. Cover crop treatments and termination methods had no significant impact on microbial community alpha diversity. Cover crop termination methods also had no significant impact on microbial community beta diversity. Families belonging to the phyla Actinobacteria, Bacterioidota, and Proteobacteria were more abundant in the cool season cover crop treatment compared to the warm season cover crop treatment. Co-occurrence network analysis indicated that incorporation of cool season cover crops or mid-season mixes in a wheat-based cropping system led to greater complexity and connectivity within these microbial networks compared to the other treatments which suggests these communities may be more resilient to environmental disturbances.																				2571-581X				NOV 2	2022	6								948220	10.3389/fsufs.2022.948220	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2022.948220													WOS:000886380000001
J	Chandler, DG; Day, N; Madsen, MD; Belnap, J				Chandler, David G.; Day, Natalie; Madsen, Matthew D.; Belnap, Jayne			Amendments fail to hasten biocrust recovery or soil stability at a disturbed dryland sandy site	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												In most drylands, biological soil crusts (biocrusts), an assemblage of lichens, bryophytes, fungi, green algae, and cyanobacteria, are critical to healthy ecosystem function. However, they are extremely sensitive to disturbance and attempts to facilitate their recovery have had variable success. In this study, we applied soil amendments designed to improve soil surface stability and accelerate biocrust recovery on an area disturbed by oil/gas exploration vehicles. Treatments included: (1) control (one time water only); (2) biocrust-only: biocrust inoculum + nutrients in water; (3) polyacrylamide gels (which are known to stabilize soils) + biocrust inoculum + nutrients in water; (4) gypsum + biocrust inoculum + nutrients in water; and (5) saline (NaCl) solution + biocrust inoculum + nutrients in water. Only the NaCl treatment showed any effects on soil properties and these were only short term. These effects included an increase in soil strength and a reduction in soil aggregate stability, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K-h), and cyanobacterial biomass. The inoculated biocrust material failed to develop and even after 10 years, there was only a very low natural recolonization of the plots. These results show that inoculating soils or applying these levels of soil amendments does not guarantee recovery of soil stability or biocrust, and that some sites are unlikely to recover without assistance. Thus, there is a need for more research into ways to enhance soil stability and identify the factors limiting biocrust establishment.

J	Xiong, L; Wu, W				Xiong, Li; Wu, Wei			Can additional agricultural resource inputs improve maize yield, resource use efficiencies and emergy based system efficiency under ridge-furrow with plastic film mulching?	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Water scarcity is a major constraint for maize production in drylands. As an efficient water-saving technology, the ridge-furrow with plastic film mulching (RM) system has achieved success in dryland farming. The efficiency of the rainwater-harvesting system in RM is greatly affected by erratic precipitation, and water absorption by crops is influenced by nutritional availability. Whether the additional supply of irrigation and nitrogen (N) re-sources under the RM system could influence the resource use efficiencies, emergy flows, and system efficiency of agricultural products is unclear. Therefore, a 3-year field study on maize plants consisting of four planting patterns (CP: conventional planting; RM; RM + SI: RM plus supplementary irrigation; RM + SI + N: RM + SI plus additional N fertilizer) was conducted from 2018 to 2020 in the Loess Plateau of China to determine resource use efficiencies, emergy flows, and system efficiency through emergy evaluation. In this study, we demonstrated the high efficiency of the micro-field rainwater-harvesting system of RM by collecting more rainwater and improving soil hydrothermal conditions. For example, the soil temperature and moisture of topsoil at seedling stage were increased by 4.3 degrees C and 13%, respectively, under RM compared with CP. The soil hydrothermal conditions in RM further improved maize yield (+35%), water use efficiency (+32%), N partial factor productivity (+37%), ra-diation use efficiency (+10%), and system efficiency (8%, from an emergy perspective), compared to CP. However, the additional supply of N or irrigation in RM + SI or RM + SI + N planting patterns failed to increase resource use efficiency, although the maize yield was increased by 9%. Furthermore, although the total emergy input was increased by 19%, it did not significantly increase energy output, and thus decreased the resource efficiency by 9% through emergy evaluation, compared to RM. Overall, RM without additional agricultural resource input could be recommended as a sustainable and cleaner production strategy for maize in drylands to address the issues of ever-increasing food demand and declining availability of production resources.

In the Monte Austral region of Patagonia Argentina, concerted efforts are underway to facilitate scaling up of ecological restoration and rehabilitation practices. Here, we evaluate financial costs and preliminary results of direct seeding as compared to outplanting of nursery-grown seedlings of three native species (Atriplex lampa, Senecio subulatus var. subulatus, and Hyalis argentea var. latisquama) considered to be high-priority dryland framework species. Comparative success is expressed in terms of plant survival and in monetary terms. The three candidate species showed low survival rates, ranging from 4.3 to 22.3%, after the first summer following direct seeding. In contrast, survival rates for planted seedlings of the same three taxa varied between 84 and 91%, after the first summer following reintroduction. However, cost of direct seeding varied between 1,693 and 1,772 US$ less per hectare, that is, 64% less than the cost of outplanting nursery seedlings. Therefore, in the search for ways to scale up ecological restoration and rehabilitation in drylands, direct seeding should receive more attention. We discuss the social and ecological perspectives and the way forward for direct seeding techniques in Patagonia. We also consider how costs could be reduced and effectiveness improved in large-scale efforts.

To mitigate the degradation of dryland ecosystems in China, the Chinese Government has launched ambitious ecological restoration projects (ERPs) in drylands, and understanding the effects and mechanisms of these projects on dryland stability is particularly important for the future integration of stability enhancement into ecosystem management goals. However, few researchers have focused on such effects. Here, the agro-pastoral ecotone in northern China, which is located in the northern drylands of China and contains several national ERPs, was used to analyze the above problem. Specifically, the stability of ecosystems in response to climate anomalies was evaluated from the perspectives of resilience and resistance, and we analyzed the impacts of ERPs and parallel policies on ecosystem stability combined with a social-ecological systemic perspective. Our results showed that the ecosystem stability has improved in the last 20 years, and although environmental factors dominated the spatial heterogeneity and temporal variations in the stability, afforestation and socioeconomic processes associated with ERPs and parallel policies also showed significant effects. Therefore, guiding and establishing a solid and low-ecological impact rural livelihoods is an important guarantee to achieving stability improvement through relevant policies. Our study decoupled the complex outcomes of ERPs from the perspective of ecosystem stability and contributes to the understanding of dryland stability from a social-ecological perspective. Furthermore, new insights and theoretical foundations are provided for incorporating stability enhancement into future goals of dryland ecosystem management.					li, Li/JPA-0218-2023; LIU, HAO/JBI-9623-2023; wang, wei/JBS-7400-2023; Wang, yl/JNR-4963-2023; Chen, Chao/JHS-6563-2023; Wang, Yue/JRY-8962-2023; yuanyuan, Li/JEZ-6497-2023; li, wei/IUQ-2973-2023; .., What/IXW-6776-2023; Wang, lingyu/JLM-2013-2023; wang, zhe/JNE-3510-2023; Yang, Lili/JTT-5215-2023; Lyu, Xin/AAM-8304-2021; liu, xiao/JLL-2119-2023; Zhang, Yunyi/JHS-3626-2023; li, yifan/JHU-9272-2023; Li, Yan/JUU-5189-2023; Wang, Yining/JQW-2010-2023; Li, Ly/JCD-4746-2023; Wang, lili/IXD-9828-2023; zhao, lin/JJF-0406-2023; YI, J/JJE-7713-2023; Wang, Xuechun/JRX-6509-2023; Chen, Haixia/JHT-3150-2023; Zhou, Yue/JHS-8791-2023; wang, jun/JPY-3635-2023; Wang, Xin/JVE-0200-2024; Yang, Ying/JLL-3724-2023; Li, Yao/JJC-2927-2023; liu, jingwen/JQW-9270-2023; wang, xiaoqiang/JMT-2783-2023; zheng, yan/JKJ-3632-2023; Wang, Chao/JHT-6081-2023; zhang, ly/JMB-7214-2023; wang, yingying/JSK-6741-2023; Liu, Jie/JCP-1070-2023; sun, huan/JEO-7152-2023; Zhang, Wei/JKI-3565-2023; WANG, Bin/JGM-2639-2023; wang, chen/JED-7289-2023; Li, Wen/JQI-4757-2023; li, qing/JEF-9044-2023; li, xiang/JCN-9316-2023; yang, xiao/JLL-7721-2023; Wang, Jing/JRW-1512-2023; LI, Xiang/JBJ-8387-2023; Huang, YQ/JOK-7580-2023; Li, Yan/JRW-0176-2023; liu, yang/JMB-9083-2023; zhang, ying/JQX-1479-2023; Li, YU/JQV-2716-2023; Zeng, Yun/JFK-6190-2023; zhang, xinyu/JKI-8403-2023; Li, Wei/JLL-4365-2023; wang, xi/JNT-5162-2023; zhao, yan/JNT-6961-2023; Zhang, Yuan/JUF-7293-2023; Yang, Fan/JMA-9594-2023; zhang, xiao/JCN-8822-2023; wang, xiaoxuan/JMP-6531-2023; LI, WEI/JUE-9796-2023; Li, Lei/JPE-6543-2023; yang, rui/JHI-3328-2023; Zhang, Junran/JRY-8660-2023	Wang, Yue/0000-0001-8673-6358; Yang, Lili/0009-0008-2926-484X; Lyu, Xin/0000-0002-5344-8736; 													1085-3278	1099-145X				JUN	2023	34	10					3003	3016		10.1002/ldr.4663	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4663		APR 2023											WOS:000962435300001

Soil surface mulching with plastic film has been widely used to improve soil water availability in the Loess Plateau of China. However, a systematic assessment on soil water balance dynamics under plastic mulching is still lacking. We conducted a meta-analysis on plastic mulching observations across the Loess Plateau to quantify the intensity of evapotranspiration (ET), spatiotemporal dynamics of soil water storage (SWS), and annual soil water balance in the plastic mulching systems. The results indicated that compared with non-mulching, plastic mulching significantly enhanced ET by 2.6% across the entire dataset. The magnitude of intensified ET was strongly associated with mulching pattern, mean annual precipitation and nitrogen application. Plastic mulching led to a significant increase in SWS by 8.4% at 0-60 cm soil layer, yet a decrease by 0.8% at 60-200 cm layer over the growing season, comparing with non-mulching. Importantly, an effective water recovery effect was observed at the deep soil layer under plastic mulching, as evidenced by the significantly greater SWS (+30%) over the fallow season, in comparison with that of non-mulching. Nitrogen input level and mean annual precipitation proved to be the most important factors in driving SWS. As a result, crop yield and water use efficiency were substantially improved under plastic mulching, and such enhancements were the most pronounced under full plastic mulching and lower annual mean precipitation. Increased vegetation growth due to plastic mulching can turn to impact soil water dynamics in both growing and fallow seasons, but it did not disrupt the annual equilibrium of SWS. Particularly, more precipitation storage at deep soil layer during the non-growing season appeared to fully offset the extra water loss by enhanced ET. Our findings provide critical insight into the success of plastic mulching farming practice regarding field productivity and soil water sustainability.

However, although they are both millet-based agricultural production methods, with various subtypes in different regions of northern China. In the Songhua River Region in northeast China, the ecological environment and abundant natural resources led to the slow development of agriculture, and it was only after the Liaojin Dynasties that a mature farming industry was formed. Material and MethodWe used the plant flotation instrument to flotation the soil samples unearthed in the Luotong Mountain City, a Liaojin period site in Songhua River Region, northeast China, and collected the charred plant seeds. Then observing them with the electron microscope, we identified and counted the plant seeds in this site. ResultIt was found that this region is still a millet-based crop utilization structure, and a total of 11 types of charred agricultural crop seeds were excavated from flotation at the Luotong Mountain City site. And the barnyard millet crops occupy a prominent advantage, with ubiquity of more than 91%. DiscussionThe ancestors of this region were still engaged in a millet-based agricultural strategy during this period, with a certain lag compared to the Central Plains'agricultural strategy where Triticeae crops had become dominant. In addition, the crop structure with the millet-based agriculture of the region is also somewhat different from that of the Central Plains. Through comparative studies of surrounding sites and reference to historical documents, it was found that this difference in crop structure is a phenomenon unique to the Songhua River Region and is related to the dietary habits of the local settled Jurchen nomads, who ate barnyard millet meal.

Time, climate, and soil settings set the course for reclamation outcomes following dryland energy development	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Soil attributes, climate, and time since reclamation have important implications for oil and gas reclamation success on drylands. It is uncertain if reclaimed well pads, on highly degraded drylands, can successfully regain ecological function or meet indicator benchmarks for reclamation. Here, our goals were to assess patterns in reclamation outcomes relative to (1) soil attributes, climate, and time since reclamation; and (2) plant and soil reference benchmarks. We collected a suite of plant, soil, and landscape characteristics from 134 reclaimed well pads on the Colorado Plateau that spanned climate and soil gradients and ranged from 2 to 20 years post-reclamation, then compared characteristics to those from 583 reference plots. On the reclaimed pads, less saline soils, more mesic climates, and longer time since reclamation were associated with favorable reclamation outcomes based on metrics of plant species richness and diversity, plant structure, and cover of important plant functional groups. However, most pads had major departures in 1/4 indicators, suggesting unsuccessful reclamation. Arid warm locations with shallow soils had the greatest percentage of major departures, and noxious plant richness had the greatest departures across soil and climate settings. Our assessment indicates reclamation is failing in key metrics for most pads, and the results highlight the role of environmental conditions in driving reclamation outcomes. These new insights are valuable for ascertaining possible reclamation outcomes and success rates following energy related disturbance, including orphaned wells and renewable energy development. Importantly, the approach used here has applicability for setting benchmarks and outcome standards.

Much research has been done to quantify the yield gap of wheat, maize and rice globally and of wheat, barley, canola, sorghum and pulse crops in Australia. However, crops are grown in rotations (recurring crop sequences) that vary in their cropping intensities and in the diversity of their species. Little is known about yield gaps at the cropping system level, especially in regions where there are many possible combinations of crop types and fallow periods. This prompted us to investigate crop rotations in Australia's subtropical grains region where current crop rotations include winter and summer cropping with cereal, pulse and oilseed crops interspersed with fallow periods ranging from nil to 18 months duration. To determine the system level yield gaps, we simulated the water-limited yield potential of 26 locally practiced crop rotations for over 800 weather stations by up to 3 soil types per station. We captured the impact of climate variability with 30-35 years by 2-7 fields per rotation for each site. We expressed the results in terms of energy, protein and revenue per hectare per year and mapped the results of the optimal rotations over the cropping zone. Surprisingly, a single rotation (sorghum/ fallow/mungbean/wheat/fallow/chickpea rotation; with 4 crops in 3 years, balanced between summer and winter crops and between cereal and pulse crops) was optimal for revenue over almost the whole subtropical grain zone. Using revenue as the metric for yield gaps at statistical local area scale we found, over the whole subtropical zone, a mean revenue gap of 970 $/ha/yr. This represents a relative revenue (Revenue% = 100 x (actual revenue/water-limited revenue)) of 34% which is much lower than expected from the 40-60% relative yields achieved by individual crops. We investigated whether growers may select rotations that have lower revenue than the optimal rotation in response to economic factors such as profit and risk. We found that for much of the area the same rotation that optimised revenue also optimised profit. However, for some of the cropping zone, particularly in the south western portion, a different, less intensive and more winter dominant, rotation was most profitable. Similarly, risk averse farmers may choose less productive and profitable rotations with less risk.

Dryland organic farming increases floral resources and bee colony success in highly simplified agricultural landscapes	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Agricultural intensification has contributed to declines in wild bee populations at local and regional scales. The Northern Great Plains is a key region for small grain, forage, pulse, and oilseed production, yet the impact of available floral resources on colony success of eusocial bees is unknown. To assess the effects of farming system on bee colony success (relative growth rate and fecundity) and worker condition (lipid content and wing wear), we placed 60 mini-colonies of Bombus impatiens in six conventional and six organic spring wheat fields near Big Sandy, Montana, USA over two growing seasons. Consistent with our expectations, we found that flower density and forb richness were positively associated with colony relative growth rate and fecundity. Similarly, flower density, forb richness, and the relative growth rate and fecundity of B. impatiens colonies were greater in organic fields when compared to conventional fields. Workers from organic fields had lower mean wing wear and marginally greater average body lipid content. However, there were no differences in the number of reproductives (queens, workers, and males) between two systems. Lastly, though the overall composition of colony-collected pollen was not different across the farming systems, colony-collected pollen species richness was greater in organic fields in one of the two sampled growing seasons. We conclude that by increasing B. impatiens colony success and individual worker condition, the greater floral resources observed in organic systems can contribute to better biodiversity-based indirect ecosystem services in the highly simplified agricultural landscapes that dominates the Northern Great Plains.

The N uptake patterns of understory plants may vary beneath different types of overstory trees, especially through the difference in their type of mycorrhizal association (arbuscular mycorrhizal, AM; or ectomycorrhizal, ECM), because soil mycorrhizal community and N availability differ beneath AM (non-ECM) and ECM overstory trees (e.g., relatively low nitrate content beneath ECM overstory trees). To test this hypothesis, we examined six co-existing AM-symbiotic understory tree species common beneath both AM-symbiotic black locust (non-ECM) and ECM-symbiotic oak trees of dryland forests in China. We measured AM fungal community composition of roots and natural abundance stable isotopic composition of N (delta N-15) in plant leaves, roots, and soils. The root mycorrhizal community composition of understory trees did not significantly differ between beneath non-ECM and ECM overstory trees, although some OTUs more frequently appeared beneath non-ECM trees. Understory trees beneath non-ECM overstory trees had similar delta N-15 values in leaves and soil nitrate, suggesting that they took up most of their nitrogen as nitrate. Beneath ECM overstory trees, understory trees had consistently lower leaf than root delta N-15, suggesting they depended on mycorrhizal fungi for N acquisition since mycorrhizal fungi transfer isotopically light N to host plants. Additionally, leaf N concentrations in the understory trees were lower beneath ECM than the non-ECM overstory trees. Our results show that, without large differences in root mycorrhizal community, the N uptake patterns of understory trees vary between beneath different overstory trees.

Increases in aridity lead to drastic shifts in the assembly of dryland complex microbial networks	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												We have little information on how and why soil microbial community assembly will respond to predicted increases in aridity by the end of this century. Here, we used correlation networks and structural equation modeling to assess the changes in the abundance of the ecological clusters including potential winner and loser microbial taxa associated with predicted increases in aridity. To do this, we conducted a field survey in an environmental gradient from eastern Australia and obtained information on bacterial and fungal community composition for 120 soil samples and multiple abiotic and biotic factors. Overall, our structural equation model explained 83% of the variance in the two mesic modules. Increases in aridity led to marked shifts in the abundance of the two major microbial modules found in our network, which accounted for >99% of all phylotypes. In particular, the relative abundance of one of these modules, the Mesic Module #1, which was positively related to multiple soil properties and plant productivity, declined strongly with aridity. Conversely, the relative abundance of a second dominant module (Xeric Module #2) was positively correlated with increases in aridity. Our study provides evidence that network analysis is a useful tool to identify microbial taxa that are either winners or losers under increasing aridity and therefore potentially under changing climates. Our work further suggests that climate change, and associated land degradation, could potentially lead to extensive microbial phylotypes exchange and local extinctions, as demonstrated by the reductions of up to 97% in the relative abundance of microbial taxa within Mesic Module #1.

Drought Sensitivity and Trends of Riparian Vegetation Vigor in Nevada, USA (1985-2018)	REMOTE SENSING												Dryland riparian areas are under increasing stress due to expanding human water demands and a warming climate. Quantifying responses of dryland riparian vegetation to these pressures is complicated by high climatic variability, which can create strong, transient changes in vegetation vigor that could mask other disturbance events. In this study, we utilize a 34-year archive of Landsat satellite data to (1) quantify the strength and timescales of vegetation responses to interannual variability in drought status and (2) isolate and remove this influence to assess resultant trends in vegetation vigor for riparian areas across the state of Nevada, the driest state in the USA. Correlations between annual late-summer Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) were calculated across a range of time periods (varying timing and durations) for all riparian pixels within each of the 45 ecoregions, and the variability of these values across the study area is shown. We then applied a novel drought adjustment method that used the strongest SPEI-NDVI timescale relationships for each ecoregion to remove the influence of interannual drought status. Our key result is a 30 m resolution map of drought-adjusted riparian NDVI trends (1985-2018). We highlight and describe locations where impacts of invasive species biocontrol, mine water management, agriculture, changing water levels, and fire are readily visualized with our results. We found more negatively trending riparian areas in association with wide valley bottoms, low-intensity agricultural land uses, and private land ownerships and more positive trends in association with narrow drainages, public lands, and surrounding perennial water bodies (an indication of declining water levels allowing increased vegetative cover). The drought-adjusted NDVI improved the statistical significance of trend estimates, thereby improving the ability to detect such changes. Results from this study provide insight into the strength and timescales of riparian vegetation responses to drought and can provide important information for managing riparian areas within the study area. The novel approach to drought adjustment is readily transferrable to other regions.

Although intercropping combinations and metrics have been reported, the effects of plant density on light use are not well documented. Here, we examined the light interception and use efficiency in maize-peanut intercropping with different maize plant densities in two row configurations in semiarid dryland agriculture over a two-year period. The field experiment comprised four cropping systems, i.e., monocropped maize, monocropped peanut, maize-peanut intercropping with two rows of maize and four rows of peanut, intercropping with four rows of maize and four rows of peanut, and three maize plant densities (3.0, 4.5 and 6.0 plants m(-1) row) in both monocropped and intercropping maize. The mean total light interception in intercropping across years and densities was 779 MJ.m(-2), 5.5% higher than in monocropped peanut (737 MJ.m(-2)) and 7.6% lower than in monocropped maize (843 MJ.m(-2)). Increasing maize density increased light interception in monocropped maize but did not affect the total light interception in the intercrops. Across years the LUE of maize was 2.9 g.MJ(-1) and was not affected by cropping system but increased with maize plant density. The LUE of peanut was enhanced in intercropping, especially in a wetter year. The yield advantage of maize-peanut intercropping resulted mainly from the LUE of peanut. These results will help to optimize agronomic management and system design and provide evidence for system level light use efficiency in intercropping. (C) The Author(s) 2021.

Particularly in arid and semi-arid mountainous regions, however, it remains unclear whether EF or DF dominate in the community assembly of different life forms or how they interact along elevational gradients. This research aims to reveal how different ecological processes influence herbaceous and woody community assembly and how they respond to various environmental drivers and elevational gradients. Here we integrated taxonomic diversity (TD), phylogenetic diversity (PD), and ecological drivers across an elevational gradient of 1,420 m in the Helan Mountain Nature Reserve, in typical arid and semi-arid areas of China. This study showed that the TD and PD of herbaceous communities significantly increase linearly with changing elevation gradients, while woody 'TD' showed a unimodal pattern, and there was little relationship between woody 'PD' and elevation. Herbaceous species exhibited significant phylogenetic clustering at low elevations, where they were influenced by climate, aspect, and tree cover. However, woody species exhibited random patterns across elevations. Herbaceous and woody species' taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity is governed primarily by spatial turnover rather than nestedness. Spatial turnover is caused primarily by EF and DF's combined influence, but their relative importance differs between herbaceous and woody communities. Therefore, we conclude that the responses of herbaceous and woody plants along elevation gradients in the Helan Mountains are decoupled due to their different adaptation strategies to climate factors in the drylands. These findings are important for understanding the assembly mechanisms driving plant communities in dryland under the context of dramatic increases in drought driven by climate warming.

Areas outside plant canopies may not recover as much as areas under canopies, but the spatial extent of nurse plants' beneficial impacts is not fully understood. This study aimed to quantify the spatial and temporal aggregate nurse effects (zones of influence) of shrubs compared with trees planted for land rehabilitation in a desertified region of Inner Mongolia, China. We conducted vegetation surveys in pairs of replicate 20 x 20 m plots, each subdivided into 100 subplots (each 2 x 2 m), on four types of rehabilitation sites: shrub (Caragana microphylla) plantation sites managed for 6 or 24 years and tree (Populus simonii) plantation sites managed for 5 or 24 years. Surface soil physiochemical properties and litter amount were also measured inside and outside of nine canopies on each site. The aggregate nurse effects of improved understory vegetation and surface soil conditions extended beyond the canopies of individual plants in C. microphylla and P. simonii plantations. However, these effects were more concentrated under the canopies of C. microphylla, whereas the effects under P. simonii were spread evenly over the plantation site. This difference resulted in faster rehabilitation at the site scale in P. simonii plantations. A major factor contributing to the higher rehabilitation performance of P. simonii appeared to be larger plant height, which provides greater windbreak and shading effects compared to shrubs. Xerophytic native trees that require less water than P. simonii may be a better option for rehabilitation.																			1061-2971	1526-100X				AUG	2021	29	6							e13364	10.1111/rec.13364	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.13364		APR 2021											WOS:000642338600001
J	Chafaa, S; Mimeche, F; Chenchouni, H				Chafaa, Smail; Mimeche, Fateh; Chenchouni, Haroun			Diversity of insects associated with olive (Oleaceae) groves across a dryland climate gradient in Algeria	CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST												This study investigated insect diversity of olive (Olea europaea Linnaeus (Oleaceae)) groves grown in arid and semiarid climates in northeastern Algeria. Using several sampling techniques, a total of 1326 insect specimens were collected and identified into 151 species, 124 genera, 65 families, and 10 orders. Hymenoptera and Coleoptera were quantitatively the most abundant, whereas the dominant functional feeding groups were phytophages then predators. The entomofauna included several olive pests such as Bactrocera oleae (Rossi) (Diptera: Tephritidae), Parlatoria oleae (Colvee) (Hemiptera: Diaspididae), Euphyllura olivina (Costa) (Hemiptera: Liviidae), and Liothrips oleae Costa (Thysanoptera: Phlaeothripidae). Although insect diversity parameters recorded for both observed and expected species richness were higher in olive groves grown under semiarid compared with arid climate, the completeness rate of species richness obtained using the nonparametric incidence estimators was higher in arid olive groves. Generalised linear models showed that the number of individuals and species richness varied significantly between climates (P < 0.01), whereas the variation of the rest of diversity parameters was not significant. Diversity traits of insect assemblage of each climatic region were positively correlated. Besides, the Mantel permutation test revealed similar patterns (r = 0.91, P < 0.0001) between correlation matrices of the two climates. When increasing the number of samples, species richness extrapolation revealed that diversity is expected to increase by 130% in olive groves grown under arid climate and 93% in semiarid climate. These increases are related to continuous appearance of rare and scarce insects as demonstrated by species rarefaction curves. Even with high evenness values of insect communities, similarity was low between climate indicating the rarity and scarcity of populations.

Evaluation of the capacity of the DNA barcode ITS2 for identifying and discriminating dryland plants	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH												Many of the plants that grow in arid and semi-arid regions under harsh conditions (drought, salinity and misuse) are of medical importance. Desert plants also provide other benefits; so conservation efforts should be strengthened in these areas. In this study, three DNA barcodes-chloroplast maturase-K (matK), ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rbcL) and secondary internal transcribed spacer (ITS2)-were tested in order to determine the ability of these markers to distinguish between various species. A total of 93 fresh and dry samples belonging to 30 plant families were examined. These are native to the arid lands around Makkah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Various tools and tests were used to evaluate the efficiency of the barcode markers; these included the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST), as well as the use of inter-and intraspecific distances, barcode gap, prediction of the secondary structure of the ITS2 and phylogenetic methods. The results confirmed the efficiency and superiority of the ITS2 loci over two chloroplast genes: matK and rbcL. ITS2 had a 97% success rate with amplification and a 95% success rate with sequencing, showing 100% identification at the family level, 77% identification at the genus level and 70% species resolution. A clear barcode gap was observed between inter- and intraspecific distances. Identification was achieved even in cases of degraded samples or old herbarium specimens. This study contributes to DNA barcode data by adding 224 DNA sequences of desert plants to the National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI database. The results of this study are important and useful for application in each of the following fields: validation of medicinal plant identity, conservation, and taxonomic and evolutionary studies.

Influence of Crop and Land Management on Wind Erosion from Sandy Soils in Dryland Agriculture	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Minimizing wind erosion on agricultural fields is of great interest to farmers. There is a general understanding that vegetation can greatly minimize the wind erosion taking place. However, after harvest, a low vegetation cover can be inevitable, whereby the amount of stubble that remains on a field is dependent on the crop type and land management. This study aims at quantifying the vulnerability to wind erosion of different crops, and the possibility to predict the vulnerability based on high precision aerial images. The study area was the semi-arid Free State, which holds large intensive agriculture on sandy soils. These croplands have been identified as the largest emitter of dust in South Africa. The main crop in the region is maize, but also sunflower, peanut and fallow fields are common land-use types. On these fields, the horizontal sediment flux, the saltation threshold, and aerodynamic roughness length were measured, and the soil cover was assessed using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery. The results showed a strong relationship between the soil cover and the sediment flux, whereby fallow and groundnut fields have the highest wind erosion risk. These results emphasize the great importance of soil cover management to prevent wind erosion.

Accurate estimation of ET based on data-driven methods is of great theoretical and practical significance for exploring soil evaporation, plant transpiration and the regional hydrological balance. Most existing estimation approaches were proposed based on multiple meteorological variables. This study proposed a novel hybrid estimation approach to estimate the monthly ET using only historical ET time series in the southeastern margins of the Tengger Desert, China. The approach consisted of three sections including data preprocessing, parameter optimization and estimation. The model evaluation demonstrated that the hybrid model based on the variational mode decomposition (VMD) method, grey wolf optimizer (GWO) algorithm and support vector machine (SVM) model achieved superior computational performance compared to the performance of other methods. The Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSCE) increased from 0.8588 to 0.8754 and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) decreased from 28.42% to 23.22% in the testing stage. Thus, we suggest that the hybrid VMD-GWO-SVM model will be the best choice for estimating ET in the absence of regional meteorological monitoring.

Using post-IR IRSL and OSL to date young (&lt; 200 yrs) dryland aeolian dune deposits	RADIATION MEASUREMENTS												Determining the most appropriate luminescence protocol, coupled with suitable data processing methods, for dating recently deposited sediments ( < 200 years) is important for identifying episodes of sediment movement and interpreting historical landscape dynamics. Issues of partial bleaching, dim luminescence signals and the incorrect application of rejection criteria, can lead to inaccurate and imprecise ages of recent sediment deposition. This study first compares the performance of quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and K-feldspar post-IR IRSL (pIRIR) measurements in a series of dose recovery preheat plateau, bleachability and remnant dose tests. Sediments of known historical age are used to identify the most suitable aliquot size and age model choice for further application on near-surface aeolian dune sediments from the Nebraska Sandhills. Results show that the ideal conditions for measuring these aeolian sediments are small aliquots (2 mm) of either quartz or K-feldspar coupled with the relevant protocols (OSL130 PIRIR170) and the unlogged-CAM and unlogged-MAM respectively. Results of 4 +/- 7 years (quartz) and 4 +/- 8 years (K-feldspar) are in excellent agreement with aeolian sediments of known age 5-6 years. Additionally, we find a revised set of rejection criteria is useful for accurately identifying the appropriate aliquots or grains for reliable age estimation. Sensitivity testing of recuperation rejection criteria highlights the caution that should be taken to avoid arbitrarily applying rejection criteria and biasing towards age overestimations.

Field experiments were conducted with or without irrigation as the main plot and K fertilizer rates as subplot treatments. Granular K was applied preseason at rates of 0, 45, 90, 134, 179, and 224 kg K ha(-1). Two in-season foliar K programs applied a total of either 2.8 or 5.6 kg K ha(-1) were included to compare against the check. Experiments were set up on two distinct soil mapping units (SMUs) in Starkville, MS, including a Leeper silty clay loam (LSCL; fine, smectitic, nonacid, thermic Vertic Epiaquepts) and a Marietta fine sandy loam (MFSL; fine-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Fluvaquentic Eutrudepts). Response variables collected include lint yield and fiber quality, leaf K concentrations, and cotton growth and development parameters. Across all years of the experiment, LSCL lint yields increased at a rate of 41 and 118 kg ha(-1) per 45 kg K ha(-1) under rainfed and irrigated conditions, respectively. On the MFSL, lint yield increase was not significant for either rainfed or irrigated conditions. Leaf K concentrations at first bloom and 4 weeks after first bloom responded quadratically to K rate, with peak leaf K concentrations occurring between 134 and 179 kg K ha(-1). Differences in cotton growth parameters were observed; however, differences were likely physiologically insignificant. For all parameters, foliar K application programs did not differ from the untreated check. This investigation showed that foliar K application alone are insufficient, and responses to granular K and irrigation were dependent on SMUs.

To combat land degradation, China has implemented a series of ecological restoration programs (ERPs). This study selected the northern dryland of China as a case study to examine the efficiency of ERPs, and the response of soil loss to afforestation efforts and climatic conditionswas discussed using the principles fromthe ecological theory of non-linear ecosystem dynamics. Owing to the combined impacts of declining wind speed and rapid vegetation restoration, the soil erosion for the entire region was substantially reduced from 1990 to 2015. However, the rainfall fluctuated considerably, particularly for the period from the late 1990s to early 2000s. Several drought events to some extent inhibited vegetation growth and further offset afforestation efforts, resulting in degradations in vegetation structure and soil retention function, which have been aggravating soil erosion since 2005. In certain representative sandstorm areas, limited increase in rainfall was not enough to promote vegetation growth, and therefore the vegetation cover did not present increasing trends and, in some cases, even declined significantly. The responses in terms of land degradation to climatic conditions and afforestation efforts behaved in a non-linear dynamic manner, providing essential insights into appropriate timings, climate-induced windows of opportunity, and risk in recovering and sustaining ecosystems, and eventually moving towards the land degradation neutrality (LDN) target. The climate-induced windows of opportunity and risk are critical in identifying the time for starting human interventions to mitigate and halt land degradation. Meanwhile, effective investment actions should be taken according to existing environmental conditions and critical thresholds, to achieve LDN at minimum risk and cost. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, it is imperative to develop comprehensive utilization of straw, and promote the green development of agriculture in rainfed regions. A dryland field experiment was conducted in semiarid northwestern China in 2017 and 2018 and included three treatments: maize straw strip mulching with alternating strips of mulched and non-mulched soil (MSSM), and double ridge-furrow fully mulched soil with white or black plastic film (DRWP or DRBP, respectively). The results show that the interaction between mulching treatment and year significantly influenced maize silage yield, grain yield, biomass yield, aboveground plant water content at silage maize harvest stage, ears ha(-1), kernels ear(-1), and thousand kernel weight (p< 0.001,p= 0.002,p< 0.001,p< 0.001,p< 0.001,p< 0.001,p< 0.001, andp< 0.001, respectively). For silage, maize growth under straw strip mulching was greater than that of the double ridge mulching system. Silage yield of MSSM was significantly higher than that of DRWP and DRBP, but maize grain and biomass yields under MSSM were significantly lower those under DRWP and DRBP in 2017 and 2018. Compared with the double ridge mulching system, net economic return from silage with MSSM was significantly increased by 28.31% and 20.85% in 2017 and 2018, respectively, and net economic return from grain was 6.67% lower in 2017 and 2.34% higher in 2018. The MSSM treatment exhibited water-temperature coupling; the MSSM treatment significantly reduced soil temperature in the 0-25 cm soil layer by 1.23-2.14 degrees C and increased soil water storage in the 0-200 cm soil layer by 9.75 and 24.10 mm in 2017 and 2018, respectively, thereby delaying growth development of maize by about 13 days. Therefore, straw mulch can replace plastic film mulch and serve as an environmentally friendly cultivation method for maize in semiarid rainfed regions.

The objective of the present study was to develop a methodology to determine sites with different soil potential moisture availability to improve the delimitation of homogeneous crop management zones in semiarid environments. An altimetric survey was carried out in the field to obtain a DEM with a spatial resolution of 5 m. Subsequently, maps of slopes, area of flow accumulation, sub-basins of the Topographic Wetness index (TWI) were made. A potential moisture availability (PMA) map was generated by linking the TWI map with a map of previously reclassified sub-basins and homogeneous PMA zones were delineated. Soil profiles were sampled on transects through the PMA zones, and during three growing seasons soil moisture contents were recorded. The PMA zones had homogeneous soil types and moisture contents and differed from each other in soil profile depth and available moisture contents, especially in the more humid season. Soil moisture correlated well with the antecedent precipitation index (API) during crop growth and in the PMA zones with higher altimetry, while only weak relationships were found during fallow periods and for the lowest altimetry PMA zone. The proposed methodology was useful for identifying landscape portions with differences in potential moisture availability as the spatial-temporal variability was represented. The use of the API combined with the potential moisture availability allowed a better fit in its relationship with the soil available moisture contents (AMC).

However, it remains unclear how biocrusts affect pore structure in the micrometric point of view. In this study, X-ray computed tomography and image analysis were employed to quantify the differences in soil pore structure between bare soil and three types of biocrusts (cyanobacterial, cyanobacterial-moss mixed, and moss crusts) at 0-50 mm depth. Three-dimensional images were segmented and analyzed to assess morphological and geometrical properties, such as porosity, pore volume, degree of anisotropy, Euler number, pore shape, pore connectivity, and pore tortuosity. Our results showed that the porosity of three types of biocrusts was, on average, 100% higher than bare soil, and the porosity ranked in order of moss crusts > mixed crusts > cyanobacterial crusts > bare soil. In comparison to bare soil, pore surface area density, mean pore volume, and node density of biocrusts were increased by 45%, 422%, and 52% on average, respectively. Biocrusts had larger fractal dimensions but lower degrees of anisotropy, mean tortuosity, and Euler number, which indicates the pore structure of biocrust became more complex and stable with higher connectivity compared to bare soil. Additionally, elongated pores had the largest contribution to porosity, and these pore proportions were significantly higher in biocrusts than bare soil. More importantly, the pore network model and network analysis revealed that biocrusts have a higher connected porosity (17% vs. 4%), connected porosity/ isolated porosity (11.7 vs. 0.6), average coordination number (8 vs. 5), and number of channels (14,480 vs. 807), but a lower average channel length (2.7 vs. 3.8 mm), which indicates that the physical and topological structures of pore network in biocrusts were reconfigured and exhibited a better pore network connectivity. Moreover, the biocrusts increased soil water holding capacity by 87% on average, but decreased saturated hydraulic conductivity by 55% as compared to bare soil. From the reshaped pore structure, improved soil water holding capacity, and decreased infiltrability of the biocrusts in comparison to bare soil, we conclude that biocrusts play a vital role in surface soil water balance, which subsequently affect surface hydrological processes (e.g., runoff generation and evaporation) in drylands.					; Xiao, Bo/F-9722-2013	Heitman, Joshua/0000-0002-8708-0693; Xiao, Bo/0000-0002-9544-4207													0022-1694	1879-2707				AUG	2023	623								129846	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129846	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129846		JUN 2023											WOS:001038732100001

Mousavi			Water deficit index to evaluate water stress status and drought tolerance of rainfed barley genotypes in cold semi-arid area of Iran	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Drought and heat are major stresses that adversely affect crop production in arid and semi-arid regions. This study assessed the water stress status of rainfed barley genotypes and identified their critical drought stress threshold in the cold semi-arid area of Iran. The field experiments were conducted at the Dryland Agricultural Research Institute, Maragheh, Iran in 2015-16 and 2017-18. The experimental design was a split-plot arrangement in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The main plots included two water regimes, rainfed (stress) and supplemental irrigation, and the subplots included 15 barley genotypes. Data were collected for grain yield, and its components, surface temperature (Ts) taken at six crop growth stages from flag leaf to soft dough, and normalized differences vegetative index (NDVI) at seven crop growth stages from the first node to the soft dough. The water deficit index (WDI) was determined using NDVI and the difference between Ts and air temperature (Ta). Based on the WDI, the critical water stress and temperature thresholds for genotypes were 0.59, and 24.3 degrees C, respectively. The identified temperature threshold was equivalent to 7.2 mm day(-1) evapotranspiration (ET0) and 4.3 kPa vapor pressure deficient. The genotypes experienced a maximum drought stress when the WDI, Ts, and ET0 reached 1.01, 34.6 degrees C (upper limit), and 11.6 mm day(-1), respectively. The critical drought threshold happened 254 days after the sowing date. WDI had strong negative correlation with both grain and biological yields. According to WDI, Ghara Arpa, Kuban-06, and Ansar genotypes were placed in the drought-tolerant group and are suitable for rainfed conditions, whereas ARM-ICB, Sahand, Sararood1, and Ste/Antares//YEA762 genotypes were more suitable for supplemental irrigation conditions. It can be concluded that WDI could effectively discriminate genotypes into tolerant and susceptible groups, and identify the starting time of water stress under rainfed conditions.

The field experiment was performed from 2016 to 2020 in the eastern part of Loess Plateau, China, to study the effect of two sowing practices were carried out before summer fallow i.e., Wide-space sowing (WS) and drill sowing (DS). The results indicated the soil water content, root length surface density (RLSD), at anthesis by drought was 44% under WS and 29% with DS, while the reduction in above-ground dry weight was 67% under WS and 56% under DS. More soil water was depleted from the deep soil layer (80-100 cm depth) than that in the shallow layer (20-60 cm depth. The average contribution rates of soil water content at sowing to grain yield under DS were 23%-25%. Thus, drill sowing in summer fallow should be adopted for high water storage and yield stability.

However, achieving these services in dryland cropping systems can be highly challenging, and cover crops may carry a greater risk of causing ecosystem disservices. Assessment of the balance of ecosystem services vs disservices is critical for understanding the potential role of cover crops within dryland cropping systems. The objective of this meta-analysis was to assess the effects of cover cropping in drylands on soil water and soil mineral nitrogen content at sowing of subsequent cash crops and their yields compared to control fallows. A total of 38 articles were examined, for a total of 1006 cash crop yield, 539 soil water, and 516 soil mineral nitrogen independent studies, spanning the period 1994-2021. On average, cover cropping reduced cash crop yield by 7%, soil water content by 18%, and soil mineral nitrogen by 25%, with significant variation across climates, soil types, and crop management conditions. Subsequent cash crop yields changed by +15, +4, -12, and -11% following cover crops in tropical, continental, dry, and temperate dryland climates, respectively. The most significant yield benefits were proportionate to soil water content and soil mineral nitrogen at the time of cash crop sowing. This is the first meta-analysis to demonstrate that minimum annual precipitation of similar to 700 mm represents a "break-even" point to realize significant cash crop yield benefits of cover cropping compared to control fallows in dryland environments. The successful incorporation of cover crops into dryland cropping systems requires careful planning based on context-specific biophysical conditions to minimize trade-offs between ecosystem services and disservices.

Soil bacterial communities of wheat vary across the growing season and among dryland farming systems	GEODERMA												Despite knowledge that management practices, seasonality, and plant phenology impact soil microbiota; farming system effects on soil microbiota are not often evaluated across the growing season. We assessed the bacterial diversity in soil around wheat roots through the spring and summer of 2016 in winter wheat (Triticum aestivium L.) in Montana, USA, from three contrasting farming systems: a chemically-managed no-tillage system, and two USDA-certified organic systems in their fourth year, one including tillage and one where sheep grazing partially offsets tillage frequency. Bacterial richness (range 605-1174 OTUs) and evenness (range 0.80-0.92) peaked in early June and dropped by late July (range 92-1190, 0.62-0.92, respectively), but was not different by farming systems. Organic tilled plots contained more putative nitrogen-fixing bacterial genera than the other two systems. Bacterial community similarities were significantly altered by sampling date, minimum and maximum temperature at sampling, bacterial abundance at date of sampling, total weed richness, and coverage of Taraxacum officinale, Lamium ampleuxicaule, and Thlaspi arvense. This study highlights that weed diversity, season, and farming management system all influence soil microbial communities. Local environmental conditions will strongly condition any practical applications aimed at improving soil diversity, especially in semiarid regions where abiotic stress and seasonal variability in temperature and water availability drive primary production. Thus, it is critical to incorporate or address seasonality in soil sampling for microbial diversity.

J	Benito, M; Boutigny, L				Benito, Mila; Boutigny, Laure			Cardiovascular Clinical Assessment in Greyster Dogs in Bikejoring Training	ANIMALS												Simple Summary Regular intense exercise is known to induce cardiac hypertrophy in some dogs engaged in different physical activities, but the cardiovascular response in dogs that routinely carry out aerobic exercise in the form of bikejoring (a form of dryland mushing) is unknown. The pre- and post-competition clinical examinations usually carried out in canine athletes include an electrocardiogram due to its diagnostic value, but some cardiac structural disturbances may go unnoticed at rest, especially in the early stages of disease. In our study, changes in systolic, mean and pulse pressure were detected after exercise, while diastolic blood pressure remained stable. Numerous changes in echocardiographic variables (LVFS-left ventricle fractional shortening, LVEF-left ventricle ejection fraction, EPSS-E-point to septal separation, CO-cardiac output, CI-cardiac index, PWd-posterior wall thickness at end-diastole and major/minor axis ratio) were also found. No association was found between the sex of the animals and the differences in the data. Our findings lead us to recommend theLVF introduction of echocardiograms for the clinical evaluation of canine athletes competing in this form of mushing. Furthermore, by including echocardiograms in clinical examinations during physical training, knowledge of the individual cardiovascular response after exercise can be improved. Bikejoring is a type of dryland mushing requiring high-intensity aerobic effort, with speed peaks close to 42 km/h. Greysters (crosses between the German Shorthaired Pointer and the Greyhound) often participate in such events and perform well. The objective of this comparative study was to evaluate the clinical use of non-invasive methods in assessing the cardiovascular health of 22 Greyster dogs in physical training, by determining the differences between different cardiovascular parameters before and after physical training. Blood pressure, heart rate and echocardiographic results were compared. The mean age of the dogs was 4.4 years +/- 1.8% and 54.5% were female. All participating dogs regularly participated in bikejoring. Post-exercise increases were observed in systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MBP) and pulse pressure (SBPD), with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) remaining stable. Changes of clinical interest were observed in numerous echocardiographic variables such as left ventricle fractional shortening (LVFS), left ventricule ejection fraction (LVEF), E-point to septal separation (EPSS), cardiac output (CO), cardiac index (CI), posterior wall thickness at end-diastole (PWd) and major/minor axis ratio (MA/ma), including a decrease in the shortening fraction and an increase in EPSS after exercise. These clinical findings were observed in both males and females; they do not appear to be associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, but rather with a cardiovascular response to physical training. This study derives from the real interest of clinical veterinarians who care for highly trained canine athletes. It contributes to an increase in knowledge of the different cardiac adaptations of such dogs after intense exercise and serves to differentiate these from pathologic conditions.																			2076-2615					SEP	2020	10	9							1635	10.3390/ani10091635	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani10091635								32932929					WOS:000583336400001

Assessing the PM10 emission potential of sandy, dryland soils in South Africa using the PI-SWERL	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												The Free State has been identified as the region with the most dust sources in South Africa. These dust sources can be linked with the large, heavily cultivated cropland areas in this province, which leaves fields vulnerable to wind erosion after the harvest in the winter. For this study, the focus was on the factors that influence the emission from bare, flat surfaces on agricultural lands in this region. The Portable In-Situ Wind Erosion Laboratory (PI-SWERL) was used to measure the emission flux from adjacent crusted and loose surfaces, which was combined with shear strength, moisture, and soil texture measurements. Boosted regression tree (BRT) analyses were used to identify the variable with the highest relevance on the emission flux. On the whole dataset, that the shear strength is the most important variable that controls the emission. This is reflected in the significantly lower emission from the crusted surfaces (0.49 mg m- 2 s- 1) compared to that of loose surfaces (2.34 mg m- 2 s- 1). However, for crusted surfaces, the presence of abraders appeared to be the most significant factor in emission, showing a power relationship between the abrader count and the emission flux (R2 = 0.76). In the case of the loose surfaces, the presence of clay and silt was a major influence in emissivity, with a linear relationship between the two variables (R2 = 0.68). This difference in factors depending on the agricultural disturbance, asks for a more holistic approach when predicting emission from such arid cropland areas.					von Holdt, Johanna/J-6587-2019; Eckardt, Frank D/N-3682-2015	von Holdt, Johanna/0000-0003-1303-6208; Eckardt, Frank D/0000-0003-0200-7110; Vos, Heleen/0000-0001-5978-4696													1875-9637	2212-1684				SEP	2021	53								100747	10.1016/j.aeolia.2021.100747	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aeolia.2021.100747		SEP 2021											WOS:000702573100004

T.; Zeglin, Steve; Zhao, Zhigan			Using fertiliser to maintain soil inorganic nitrogen can increase dryland wheat yield with little environmental cost	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Nitrogen (N) deficiency is responsible for a large proportion of the exploitable yield gap that exists in Australian wheat production. In order to maximise N use efficiency (NUE), growers attempt to match N fertiliser to seasonal water limited yield potential, which in the southern grain growing region is largely determined by in-crop rainfall. Australia's variable rainfall makes water limited yield potential very difficult to predict, and growers tend to under fertilise, fearing economic and environmental losses of N if crops are over-fertilised. However, environmental losses of excess N are low in the semi-arid, winter dominant rainfall environments with high water holding capacity soils that comprise much of the wheat producing regions of south eastern Australia. This is particularly the case when high carbon (C) to N ratio crop residues are retained which facilitate rapid immobilisation of any mineral N surplus to crop requirements. We therefore propose that the exploitable yield gap in wheat could be closed if a longer-term strategy of N fertiliser application was adopted. In this strategy, growers would simply use N fertiliser to maintain an environmentally appropriate base level of inorganic N (N bank) rather than attempting to match fertiliser inputs to seasonal conditions. We used field studies with N-15 labelled fertiliser and cropping systems simulations to demonstrate that fertiliser N applied at rates calculated to maintain fixed thresholds of inorganic N (N bank criteria) and top-dressed immediately prior to the period of rapid crop uptake can substantially increase yields and profit in comparison to current practice, even when applications exceed crop demand in some years. A further benefit of this strategy is an increase in soil organic matter. Both field and simulation studies indicate that the environmental cost of such a strategy would be minimal, with only a small increase in leaching and denitrification despite higher overall rates of N application. This strategy needs to be compared with current practices in longer term field experiments to confirm production increases and lack of environmental impacts.

Keith			Nutrient Loss in Snowmelt Runoff: Results from a Long-term Study in a Dryland Cropping System	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Snowmelt runoff often comprises the majority of annual runoff in the Canadian Prairies and a significant proportion of total nutrient loss from agricultural land to surface water. Our objective was to determine the effect of agroecosystem management on snowmelt runoff and nutrient losses from a long-term field experiment at Swift Current, SK. Runoff quantity, nutrient concentrations, and loads were estimated after a change in management from conventionally tilled wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow (Conv W-F) to no-till wheat-fallow and subsequently no-till wheat-pulse (NT W-F/LP) and to an organic system with a wheat-green manure rotation (Org W-GM). The conversion from conventional tillage practices to no-till increased snowmelt runoff likely due to snow trapping by standing stubble after summer fallow. Relatedly, runoff after no-till summer fallow had higher dissolved P losses (0.07 kg P ha(-1)). Replacing summer fallow with a pulse crop in the no-till rotation decreased snowmelt runoff losses and nutrient concentrations. The Org W-GM treatment had the lowest P loss after stubble (0.02 kg P ha(-1)) but had high dissolved P concentrations in snowmelt following the green manure (0.55 mg P L-1), suggesting a contribution from incorporated crop residues. In this semiarid climate with little runoff, dissolved reactive P and NO3-N loads in snowmelt runoff were smaller than those reported elsewhere on the prairies (averaging < 0.05 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1), and < 0.2 kg NO3 -N ha(-1) yr(-1)); however, the nutrient concentrations we observed, in particular for P, even without P fertilizer addition for organic production, question the practicality of agricultural management systems in this region meeting water quality guidelines.

Abundance and nutritional status of freshwater turtles to guide delivery of environmental flows in the Murray-Darling Basin, south-eastern Australia	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												Almost half of Australian freshwater turtle species are formally listed as threatened, but little is known about the effects of water management and other factors on the abundance and health of freshwater turtles in arid and semi-arid regions. This study investigated how river flows (including the controlled release of water from an upstream storage facility, or 'environmental flow') and water quality might affect the abundance and nutritional status of three freshwater turtle species in three dryland rivers of the Murray-Darling basin in south-eastern Australia. No response in abundance or nutritional status of the broad-shelled turtle, Chelodina expansa, the eastern long-necked turtle, Chelodina longicollis, and the Macquarie turtle, Emydura macquarii, was detected in relation to river flows, possibly because of the small magnitude of the environmental flow. However, for C. expansa, the catch per unit effort (CPUE) was negatively related to increasing macrophyte cover, electrical conductivity (EC, an indicator of salinity), and turbidity. CPUE for C. longicollis was positively related to macrophyte cover and EC, and for E. macquarii it was positively related to macrophyte cover. Haematological measurements suggested that the turtles had healthy nutritional status. Body condition and blood glucose and protein were related significantly to EC, whereas haematological measurements varied significantly among species and between spring and summer. The main conclusion is that water management measures to help the conservation of these turtles should include sufficient environmental flow to produce overbank flooding, thereby creating and maintaining a wide range of habitat suitable for the differing needs of the individual species.

The hypothesis was tested that integrated use of potassium (K) and animal manures could increase mungbean (Vigna radiata L. Wilczek) productivity and profitability in the semiarid climate of Peshawar. A field experiment was carried out to investigate the effect of organic matter (composted animal manures) (5, 10, and 15 t ha(-1)) and potassium (30, 45, and 60 kg ha(-1)) under irrigated (three irrigations, no water stress) and dryland or limited irrigated (one irrigation, water stresses before flowering and after pod formation) condition on mungbean (cv. Ramazan 92). The experiment was carried out in the summer of 2017 at Agronomy Research Farm, the results revealed that crop under no water stress had delayed phenological development (took more days to flowering, pod formation, and physiological maturity), better growth by producing taller plants with a more number of leaves, nodules, and pods plant(-1), seeds pod(-1), heavy 1000-grains weight, higher biological and grain yields than water stress condition. The experiment also confirmed that the combination of the highest rate of K and organic matter had improved the vegetative growth and development, and significantly increased yield and yield contributing parameters under both water stress and no stress conditions. It was concluded that mungbean yield and yield components increased with combined application of 60 kg K ha(-1) + 15 t OM ha(-1) under full irrigated (no water stress) and limited irrigated (water stress) conditions.

In this study, the status, patterns and trends of ESs provided by the Xilingol steppe were quantitatively evaluated, and the impact of climate and land-use change on ESs were discussed. The results showed that favorable climatic conditions and the implementation of ecological policies had a substantial positive impact on regional vegetation restoration during 2000-2015. As a result of the vegetation greening, water retention and carbon sequestration increased significantly at rates of 16.01 m(3) ha(-1) and 1.75 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Soil loss caused by wind erosion, an ecosystem disservice, decreased significantly at a rate of -0.57 t ha(-1) yr(-1). Although several environmental factors had differing impacts on the ESs changes in the subregions, including the meadow, typical and desert steppes, the main factors that contributed to the enhancement of overall ESs benefits were the climatic humidification and the reduced grazing pressure in the entire study area. The above conclusion shows that, in the era of climate change, the implementation of sustainable farming-pastoral strategies can realize a "win-win" situation between ecological restoration and socioeconomic development in arid and semi-arid steppes.					liang, liang/IAO-8518-2023; lu, yang/IWE-3635-2023; li, xiao/GSN-6181-2022; li, xiao/HJP-5134-2023; li, xiao/HKV-8405-2023; li, yang/IQV-3559-2023; liu, jiaming/IWE-3196-2023; yuan, liping/JPK-7584-2023; wang, yu/IUQ-6654-2023; li, xiaofeng/GXF-9442-2022; LI, XIAO/IQV-9318-2023; wang, xu/IAN-4886-2023; Yan, Jun/IXD-7801-2023															2072-4292				FEB	2022	14	3							738	10.3390/rs14030738	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14030738													WOS:000756053000001

This paper presents a modification to the Time Series Segmented-RESidual TRENDs (TSS-RESTRENDs) method that allows for the use of temperature as an additional explanatory variable along with precipitation. TSS-RESTREND was performed over Mongolia, both with and without temperature. The addition of temperature reduced the number of pixels that fail the significance tests built into the TSS-RESTREND method from 17% to below 5%. It also improved the statistical confidence in almost all areas. Furthermore, the direction of change is consistent with previous findings that looked at vegetation trends over the same study region. When applied to all of the world's drylands, the inclusion of temperature improved the fit of the vegetation-climate relationship that underpins TSS-RESTREND in 98.8% of areas. The largest improvements to the fit were observed in both the cold drylands of central Asia and North America and the hot drylands of southern Australia. Including temperature also reduced the fraction of global vegetation change that could be attributed to neither climate nor land use from 25.5% to 15.5%.

Ecosystem resilience is considered a key concept for understanding and describing the response of ecosystems to drought. Recovery time, as an important measure of resilience, has been widely used to assess ecosystem resilience to drought, but there is a deficiency in distinguishing the difference in recovery time under various drought intensities. On the basis of the existing assessment of drought resilience based on recovery time, we defined a new resilience indicator using an exponentially fitted curve to characterize the relationship between drought intensity and the corresponding recovery time, and the resilience was quantified by the curve area. Resistance represents the capacity of ecosystems to remain stable during droughts, and we quantified the resistance indicator by the ratio of the frequency of no vegetation loss during drought to drought frequencies. Our results showed that the ecosystem resilience to drought increased from arid to sub-humid regions in China's dryland, and resistance was the lowest in the semiarid region. There was a trade-off between resilience and resistance: grassland had higher resilience and lower resistance than forestland. Drought memory contributed to the high resilience in the case of high drought frequency. These findings enriched the identification of the resilience of ecosystems to drought and the relationship between resilience and resistance and drought frequency in drylands.

On-farm seed priming and fertilizer micro-dosing: Agronomic and economic responses of maize in semi-arid Ethiopia	FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY												On-farm seed priming has been reported to improve emergence, crop establishment, and yield besides improving economic benefits in dryland agriculture. These benefits can further be improved by fertilizer micro-dosing. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of on-farm seed priming and fertilizer micro-dosing on the agronomic and economic returns of maize (Zea mays L. var. Melkassa-2) in semi-arid agro-ecological conditions in Ethiopia. The experiments consisted of four treatments: no priming and no fertilizer; no priming and fertilizer; priming and no fertilizer; and priming and fertilizer. The experiments were conducted in three locations viz., Melkassa, Ziway, and Hawassa in the central Rift Valley. Analysis of variance for each location was performed separately at p < .05. Results of each location were similar over the experimentation years, and hence, there was no need for carrying out combined analysis. Regardless of fertilization, primed plants showed faster emergence; better uniform crop stands; more vigorous plants; earlier flowering; earlier harvest; and higher grain and stover yield than no primed plants. Germination was 2-3 days earlier, and flowering and maturation of primed plants were 10 to 13 days earlier than no primed plants. Average grain yield increased by 11, 8, and 6% in Melkassa, Ziway, and Hawassa, respectively, by priming over no priming. Fertilizer micro-dosing combined with priming further improved most of the agronomic characters. Fertilizer micro-dosing combined with priming increased the average grain yield by 75, 69, and 33% in Melkassa, Ziway, and Hawassa, respectively. The economic returns also increased in the same pattern as the agronomic responses for priming, micro-dosing or their combination. To realize the potential of seed priming of increasing agronomic performances, future research and development efforts should focus on understanding the possible underling physiological and biochemical basis of this poorly understood process with the different priming techniques.

The first objective is to measure the technical efficiency of mixed crop-livestock (CL) smallholder producers operating under conservation agriculture systems in Tunisian rainfed areas. The second objective is to explore complementarities, synergies, and economies of diversification across the different production system components of these crop-livestock producers using the cross-partial derivative framework of output variables in the distance function. A simple random sampling process was employed to select and survey 59 CL smallholders operating under conservation agriculture. The collected data were analyzed using a stochastic input distance function in which synergies were estimated based on the second cross-partial derivative concept of output variables in the distance function. Results show that technical inefficiencies are significant in integrated crop-livestock systems, and there is evidence that economic diversification provides a productivity buffer against climate change threats. As a sustainable intensification strategy, this integrated system also offers a potential advantage. The results further contribute to the debate on crop diversification vs. specialization. Although an enhanced system integration could be a financially and ecologically viable option for mixed crop-livestock systems, more pathways for profitable and viable diversification of cereal-based or orchard-based systems remain to be explored.

Evaluation of performance of genotypes at a number of locations provides useful information to determine their adaptation and stability. The objectives of the study were to estimate the magnitude of genotype-environment interaction (G x E), to determine its effects, and to identify stable tef genotypes. In the study, twelve genotypes of tef were evaluated in seven environments in the Northeast part of Ethiopia. The result showed that effects of genotype, environment and the G x E were significant and explained 5.08%, 82.67% and 12.25% of the treatment variance signifying that environment was the predominant contributor of the variation. The AMMI analysis showed that five of the IPCAs were significant. The first two, being very important, explained 66.04% and 20.35% of the G x E variance, respectively. The AMMI2 biplot showed that genotypes 202416A, 202382A and 205958 were not affected by environmental fluctuations as they had minimum interaction. The GGE analysis showed that 50.12% and 33.47% of the GGE variance were captured by the first and the second IPCAs, respectively. Based on the stability statistics considered, the genotypes 205953 and 202416A could be recommended as desirable (high yielding and stable) genotypes on the locations (environments) under study; both can be used as parents for future tef crossing programs.

Interactive effect of planting date and fertiliser application on maize growth and yield under dryland conditions	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PLANT AND SOIL												Understanding the relationships among management practices during planting period will help producers to improve crop production under climate change. The interaction of planting date and soil fertility on maize yield was evaluated. Field trials were conducted during summer in 2014/15 and 2015/16 at the University of KwaZulu-Natal research farm, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. A split-plot design was used with planting date and soil fertility as main and subplots, respectively, replicated four times. The interaction between planting date and fertility level significantly influenced plant growth and physiological parameters. The highest plant growth and physiological responses occurred in early- and mid-season planted maize during 2014/15 and 2015/16, respectively. Early planting favoured crop growth, grain yield and yield components during 2014/15 (warm season), while mid planting was the best during 2015/16 (dry season). Optimal fertiliser application has economic benefits to the farmer where it is led to increase productivity at early- and mid-planting dates during warm (2014/15) and dry (2015/16) seasons, respectively. However, optimal fertiliser application only improved plant photosynthetic activity under adequate rainfall and temperature, while minimal application of fertiliser gave higher yield returns with a mid-planting date. Longer-term experiments are needed to validate the recommendations from the current study.

J	Kher, V; Dutta, S				Kher, Varun; Dutta, Sutirtha			Rangelands and crop fallows can supplement but not replace protected grasslands in sustaining Thar Desert's avifauna during the dry season	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												1. The Indian Thar Desert has lost much of its grasslands over the last few decades, mainly due to land-use change from pastoralism to agriculture. Expanding croplands and intensifying grazing pressures are popularly hypothesized to be the major drivers of biodiversity loss in the region. Our study aims to investigate the effects of contemporary land-use change on bird communities of the Western Thar Desert. 2. We surveyed 59 randomly laid line transects in a -2000 sq.km study area, to quantify parameters of bird community structure in three predominant land-cover types viz. protected grasslands, rangelands, and fallow croplands. Fieldwork for the study was conducted in the dry season (winter and summer) between December 2018 and April 2019. 3. During winter, overall bird species richness and abundance was highest in protected grasslands followed by fallow croplands and rangelands. Protected grasslands also had a higher abundance of diet and habitat specialists. Compared to protected grasslands, density was lower in fallow croplands and rangelands for 35% and 10% of species, respectively. A majority of the negatively affected species were insectivorous grassland specialists. 4. Contrary to the pattern in winter, overall bird species richness, abundance, composition, and guild structure in summer was similar across the three land-use types. Only one of the 17 analysed species had significantly lower density in modified land-use types. 5. Overall, protected grasslands were the best habitat for birds and specifically important for diet and habitat specialists, more so during the winter. Rangelands and fallow croplands sustained most generalists at comparable densities but had severe negative impacts on specialist species. 6. Synthesis and application: Our results point out that low-intensity agro-pastoral land-uses can supplement, but not replace, protected areas in conservation of Thar Desert's avifaunal diversity. This is in consonance with the idea of managing dryland habitats as agro-grassland mosaics with embedded protected areas, in order to reconcile human needs and biodiversity conservation at a landscape scale.

Springs (n = 79), streamflows (n = 48), wetlands (n = 3), endorheic lakes (n = 3), hand-dug wells (n = 48) and boreholes in unconfined aquifers (n = 25) were monitored (2015-2017). Spring discharge fluctuates between wet (2.75 +/- 1.5 L/s) and dry seasons (0.87 +/- 0.21 L/s) (n = 68, p < .0001). Spring discharge and streamflow were larger at the foot of the escarpment than at the horst (p < .001). The water level of wells varied between horsts and escarpments in the grabens (p < .02). A water level depletion of up to 2.23 m/year occurred in response to withdrawals in the irrigated plains. Importantly, water level fluctuation was faster in streams, springs and hand-dug wells than in boreholes. Striking water level variations in the grabens were linked to rainfall deficit and management scarcity. An integration of surface water and groundwater management responses will bring the water table nearer to the surface; this could mitigate water storage in the fertile and productive grabens.

The long-term effect of the RFM system on soil water is not known. A 7-yr maize (Zea mays L.) field experiment was conducted between 2012 and 2018 in the Chinese Loess Plateau to estimate the spatial and temporal variation of soil water. The objectives were to (a) understand how RFM affects soil water status during and between growing seasons; and (b) investigate whether RFM causes the formation of dry soil layers and threaten the sustainability of the agricultural system. In the nongrowing season, the average precipitation storage efficiency (PSE) of the plastic mulching treatment was 78.2%, compared to just 17.7% for no film mulching treatment. Higher PSE means that the RFM system stored more precipitation during the nongrowing season. In addition, 2- and 5-m soil profile water status showed that the film mulching did not overuse deep soil water and would not lead to the formation of dry soil layers. Our research indicated that the RFM was beneficial for increasing crop production and sustainability of agriculture in semi-arid regions. Higher PSE during the nongrowing season played an important role in the success of RFM system. We recommend that farmers adopted year-round plastic mulch management method to make fuller use of water resources.					wan, pingxing/HGE-3797-2022; Bajwa, Muhammad Naseer/AAK-5770-2020; zhang, feng/L-2587-2013; Li, Feng-Min/K-8740-2012	Bajwa, Muhammad Naseer/0000-0002-4821-1056; Li, Feng-Min/0000-0002-2144-3498; Eldoma, Ibrahim/0000-0003-0478-2030; Zhang, Feng/0000-0001-5893-0604													0002-1962	1435-0645				SEP-OCT	2020	112	5					3653	3666		10.1002/agj2.20307	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.20307													WOS:000600983000039

Evidence for a fungal loop in shrublands	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Dryland communities may mitigate the loss of limited resources by exchanging nutrients through subterranean fungal connections, termed fungal loops. In arid grasslands, fungal loops can influence community composition and primary productivity, yet their ecological significance across dryland systems remains unexplored. We investigated the functional role of fungal loops in nutrient translocation in a North American shrubland ecosystem. We traced the movement of N-15 from moss-dominated biocrusts to the dominant xeric shrub Larrea tridentata, and the movement of C-13 from L. tridentata to biocrusts in plots established in situ in the Sonoran Desert. Measurements occurred at three time points spanning 1 week following a simulated 2.5 mm rainfall event, and at distances up to 1 m from tracer application. We also used ITS sequencing to investigate changes in fungal community composition in soils over the 1-week period. We discovered movement of N-15 from biocrusts into L. tridentata foliage as well as N-15 movement to other spatially isolated moss-dominated biocrust patches, yet this movement did not occur until 4-6 days post-rainfall, when significantly higher delta N-15 was observed in L. tridentata and biocrusts compared to previous days. We did not observe consistent patterns of C-13 movement from L. tridentata into neighbouring shrubs or biocrusts, suggesting differential environmental drivers for carbon movement in this system. Fungal communities exhibited a decrease in alpha diversity on the last day of the study, indicative of a delayed community response to rainfall concomitant with nutrient translocation. Fungal endophyte orders Pleosporales and Pezizales dominated all plot soils, and order Pleosporales was significantly more abundant in N-15 enriched plots, suggesting that dark septate endophytic fungi were involved in nitrogen translocation. The delay in nutrient translocation may reflect a rainfall-triggered rebuilding of mycelial networks between community members following drought. Synthesis. Our results point to fungal-mediated nutrient exchange pathways in a previously uninvestigated vegetation type, shrublands, where nutrients are translocated between moss-dominated biocrusts and nearby shrubs. We provide the first evidence that nutrient transfer may be delayed up to 6 days following rainfall, consistent with pulse-dynamic responses in drylands, and that moss-dominated biocrusts play a role in fungal loops.

Assessment of climate change impact on maize<i> (Zea</i><i> mays</i> L.) through aquacrop model in semi-arid alfisol of southern Telangana	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												The study was under taken at ICAR-CRIDA, Hyderabad (India) to assess the climate change impact on maize crop. There were five main irrigation treatments viz., I0, I1, I2, I3, I4, two sub treatments viz., M0 (no mulching), M1 (mulching @ 5 t ha-1 with glyricidia) and two sub-sub treatments viz., NF (normal fertilizer) and HF (high fertilizer) to study the effect of supplemental irrigation and crop management practices on maize grain yield and water productivity in semi-arid alfisols of Telangana state. The results of the study indicated that, the highest average grain yield of 3.19 t ha-1 was recorded in I4 and lowest was in I0 (1.78 t ha-1). The highest average water productivity (10.65 kg ha-1 mm-1) was recorded in I4 followed and the lowest was in I0 (7.60 kg ha-1 mm-1). The AquaCrop model was calibrated for simulation of grain yield and water productivity for all treatment levels and the prediction error statistics were 0.94 < E < 0.95 %, 0.06 <RMSE< 0.12 t ha-1 and 0.59 <MAE< 0.82 t ha-1. During the validation, model performed well with model efficiency of 91 % and 73 % for grain yield and water productivity respectively and is within the acceptable limits. Under the changing rainfall and air tem-perature, the maize grain yield under rainfed condition can be sustained by application of supplemental irri-gation of 50 mm with expected increase in maize yield by 28.39-74.79 per cent in RCP 4.5 and 34.81-85.27 per cent in RCP 8.5 from near century (2025) to end century (2090) as compare to kharif 2013 in Rangareddy district of Telangana state.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				DEC 1	2022	274								107950	10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107950	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107950		OCT 2022											WOS:000930575600004

However, our understanding of vegetation stability (including resistance and resilience, which are the abilities of ecosystems to resist perturbations and return to pre-disturbance structure or function, respectively) in response to environmental changes in dryland ecosystems remains insufficient, particularly in the absence of large-scale observations of water availability. Here we introduced GRACE monthly total water storage anomaly (TWSA) data into an autoregressive model with remote sensed EVI, air temperature and precipitation to investigate the short-term vegetation stability and its influencing factors in Central Asia (CA) during 2003-2015. The results showed that the grid-level vegetation resilience in CA increased logarithmically as mean annual precipitation (R-2= 0.33, P < 0.05) but decreased linearly with increasing mean annual temperature (R-2= 0.41, P < 0.05). Vegetation resilience was not correlated with TWSA, due to the decoupling of TWSA with precipitation both spatially and temporally in the majority of CA. At the biome level, vegetation resilience also increased as a logarithmical function of aridity index (R-2 = 0.80, P < 0.05). Vegetation resistance to TWSA showed minor difference across biomes, while vegetation resistance to precipitation functioned as a parabolic curve along the aridity gradient (R-2= 0.59, P < 0.05). Our results suggest that accounting for the effects of total water column instead of precipitation only is critical in understanding vegetation-water relationships in drylands. The steep decrease in vegetation resilience in areas with high temperature and low water availability implies a high risk of collapse for these water-limited ecosystems if there are severe droughts. Furthermore, reduction in total water storage, induced by, e.g., large-scale extraction of surface runoff or shallow-layer groundwater for irrigation, can result in negative influences to natural biomes in dryland regions.

Therefore, field experiments were conducted during 2013-2015 to determine the soil water content with depth, evapotranspiration (ET), agronomic traits, grain yield, and crop water productivity under different planting densities when using RFRH planting (width of ridge and furrow is 60 cm, three rows were planted in furrow) compared with traditional flat planting. The results show that a high planting density would lead to soil drought conditions in the late reproductive growth stage, with reductions in individual plant traits and the harvest index (HI) in dry years. However, we found that RFRH planting could reduce ET and improve the soil water content at 0-120 cm soil layers in the jointing and filling stages, as well as mitigating the crop water deficit in the reproductive growth stage and the decreased HI caused by a high planting density. Compared with traditional flat planting, RFRH planting decreased the foxtail millet grain yield in the rainy year (2013) due to the relatively lower plant population, but it increased the yield in the normal rainfall years of 2014 and 2015, as well as significantly improving the crop water productivity by 7.9% and 14.0% under the optimized planting density, respectively. A relatively higher optimal planting density was always obtained in the furrows under RFRH planting compared with traditional flat planting in all three experimental years. Based on these results, we recommend increasing the planting density in the furrows to increase the grain yield and crop water productivity under RFRH planting, with a moderate planting density for foxtail millet (three rows in a 60 cm wide furrow and a plant spacing of 7.5 cm) in semiarid regions of China.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				AUG 1	2020	238								106220	10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106220	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106220													WOS:000536054500003

Predicting Soil Organic Carbon Dynamics of Integrated Crop-Livestock System in Brazil Using the CQESTR Model	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Land degradation and reduction in productivity have resulted in losses of soil organic carbon (SOC) in agricultural areas in Brazil. Our objectives were to 1) evaluate the predictive performance of CQESTR model for a tropical savannah; and 2) examine the effect of integrated management systems, including Integrated Crop-Livestock System (ICLS) scenarios on SOC stocks. Two long-term paddocks, under similar edaphic and climate conditions were used in this study. In Paddock 4 (P4) the rotation was corn (Zea mays L.) and 3.5/4.5 years pasture (Urochloa ruziziensis), while rotations in Paddock 5 (P5) included 2.5 years of soybean (Glycine max L.), dryland rice (Oryza sativa L.), and corn followed by 2.5/3.5 years pasture (U. brizantha). Measured and CQESTR simulated values were significantly (0.0001) correlated (r = 0.94) with a mean square deviation (MSD) of 7.55, indicating that the model captured spatial-temporal dynamics of SOC. Predicted SOC increased by 18.0 and 12.04 Mg ha(-1) at the rate of 0.90 and 0.60 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) under current ICLS management for P4 and P5, respectively, by 2039. ICLS increased soil C sequestration compared to simple grain cropping systems under both NT and CT due to high biomass input into the production system.

Christina			Impacts of lime application on soil bacterial microbiome in dryland wheat soil in the Pacific Northwest	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												Soil acidification is a global issue that significantly reduces crop productivity. Lime application is a viable agricultural strategy to ameliorate soil acidification. However, the knowledge of the impact of lime application on the soil microbiome is still limited. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity, structure, and compositions of the soil bacterial community after liming on wheat fields. We established winter wheat plots in two precipitation zones, Pendleton and Moro in Oregon, facing soil acidity stress, and conducted bacterial microbiome analysis after lime application using Illumina MiSeq. Soil pH increased with increasing rates of lime amendments in the surface soil (0-7.5 cm) but did not significantly change in deeper soil (7.5-15 and 15-22.5 cm). High-throughput sequencing results revealed that liming had marginally effects on soil bacterial communities. A few bacterial families, including Cytophagaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, Intrasporangiaceae, Phyllobacteriaceae, Propionibacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Sphingobacteriaceae, were correlated with lime application. In contrast, location and soil depth had a strong effect on soil bacterial communities. In addition, the impacts of liming on soil bacterial diversity and taxa were inconsistent and location- and soil depthdependent. Furthermore, four nitrifiers were quantitated from all samples by qPCR assay. Ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and Nitrobacter were most abundant in the topsoil, while ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) and Nitrospira were more abundant in deeper soil. Only Nitrospira was significantly influenced by soil pH. Overall, these results suggest that location, soil depth, lime amendments, and their interactions have significant impacts on the soil bacterial community that may influence plant health and crop yields.																			0929-1393	1873-0272				DEC	2021	168								104113	10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.104113	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.104113		JUN 2021											WOS:000701612500010

"Weaving" Different Knowledge Systems through Studying Salience of Wild Animals in a Dryland Area of Argentina	JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY												The current biodiversity conservation framework explores "nature-people" relationships, recognizing culture's central role. This study aimed to combine local knowledge with scientific ecological data to better understand the relationships between wild animals and local people. We worked in a village (Los Baldecitos) located in the area of influence of Ischigualasto Provincial Park (San Juan, Argentina). We conducted 20 free listing interviews and 12 semi-structured and open ones. We analyzed how the overall salience of different species (established through free listing and cognitive salience index) can be explained by ecological (measured through species occupancy models) and cultural (expressed in interviews) aspects of salience. The cognitive salience index and estimated animal occupancy showed a positive correlation, although it was not statistically significant (Spearman's Rho = 0.48, P = 0.095, N = 17). This could mean that cultural aspects (faunal uses, perception related to attitudes and to nature conservation) were relevant in explaining overall salience. Ten species had the highest and most statistically significant salience and were recorded by camera traps. Some of them share spaces with people (village, water points, corrals, and domestic animal areas), and others were less likely to share habitats where people are present. Wild species have cultural value related to uses and acceptance due to material (tangible benefits, ecological functions) and non-material (affectionate, emotional, aesthetic, presence in oral expression) values. Two carnivores elicited negative reactions because of their predatory damage to domestic animals. This study demonstrates methods to interweave local and scientific knowledge to understand peoplenature relationships in context.																			0278-0771	2162-4496				JUL	2021	41	2					292	306																WOS:000670819600010

In this paper, four water distribution users are used as categories, and the problem of renewable water resources allocation is transformed into a classification problem, which is included in the category of wireless virtualization processing problems, and wireless virtualization is selected to support the allocation of renewable water resources. Experiments show that the water shortage of the water distribution scheme obtained by the method in this paper is lower than that of the optimal water distribution scheme of the traditional intelligent optimization algorithm. From the water distribution cost and water shortage of a single user, it can also show that the water distribution effect of the method in this paper is excellent. The water distribution effect of traditional intelligent optimization algorithm (P < 0.05).

However, the contribution of different planting rows towards crop physiology and yield is elusive. In addition, the influence of nitrogen (N) fertilization on the physiology, yield, and soil water storage of rainfed intercropping systems is poorly understood; therefore, the objective of this experiment was to study the contribution of different crop rows on the physiological, yield, and related traits of wheat/maize relay-strip intercropping (RSI) with and without N application. The treatments comprised of two factors viz. intercropping with three levels (sole wheat, sole maize, and RSI) and two N application rates, with and without N application. Results showed that RSI significantly improved the land use efficiency and grain yield of both crops under rainfed conditions. Intercropping with N application (+N treatment) resulted in the highest wheat grain yield with 70.37 and 52.78% increase as compared with monoculture and without N application in 2019 and 2020, respectively, where border rows contributed the maximum followed by second rows. The increase in grain yield was attributed to higher values of the number of ears per square meter (10-25.33% more in comparison to sole crop without N application) during both study years. The sole wheat crop without any N application recorded the least values for all yield-related parameters. Despite the absence of significant differences, the relative decrease in intercropped maize under both N treatments was over 9% compared to the sole maize crop, which was mainly ascribed to the border rows (24.65% decrease compared to the sole crop) that recorded 12 and 13% decrease in kernel number and thousand-grain weight, respectively than the sole crop. This might be attributed to the reduced photosynthesis and chlorophyll pigmentation in RSI maize crop during the blended growth period. In a nutshell, it can be concluded that wheat/maize RSI significantly improved the land use efficiency and the total yield compared to the sole crops' yield in arid areas in which yield advantages were mainly ascribed to the improvement in wheat yield.

This pest control service has been estimated to be worth billions of dollars to agriculture globally. However, few studies have explicitly investigated the composition and abundance of dietary prey items consumed or assessed the ratio of pest and beneficial arthropods, making it difficult to evaluate the quality of the pest control service provided. In this study, we used metabarcoding to identify the prey items eaten by insectivorous bats over the cotton-growing season in an intensive cropping region in northern New South Wales, Australia. We found that seven species of insectivorous bat (n = 58) consumed 728 prey species, 13 of which represented around 50% of total prey abundance consumed. Importantly, the identified prey items included major arthropod pests, comprising 65% of prey relative abundance and 13% of prey species recorded. Significant cotton pests such as Helicoverpa punctigera (Australian bollworm) and Achyra affinitalis (cotton webspinner) were detected in at least 76% of bat fecal samples, with Teleogryllus oceanicus (field crickets), Helicoverpa armigera (cotton bollworm), and Crocidosema plebejana (cotton tipworm) detected in 55% of bat fecal samples. Our results indicate that insectivorous bats are selective predators that exploit a narrow selection of preferred pest taxa and potentially play an important role in controlling lepidopteran pests on cotton farms. Our study provides crucial information for farmers to determine the service or disservice provided by insectivorous bats in relation to crops, for on-farm decision making.

To alleviate the damage on sorghum and emphasize the relative cost and benefit, experimentation was done with various methods at Regional Agricultural Research Station, Nandyal, Acharya N G Ranga Agricultural University, Andhra Pradesh, India from 2018 to 2020 for three years. Among the twelve tested techniques, poison bait with thiodicarb 75 SP (9.52%) was effective in reducing the infestation of fall armyworm, which was on par with spinosad 45 SC (10.68%), chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC (13.37%) and emamectin benzoate 5 SG (16.21%). Higher yields with greater benefit-cost ratio were noted with chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC (5755 kg/ha; BC ratio 2.7) followed by spinosad 45 SC (5544 kg/ha; BC ratio 2.6), thiodicarb 75 SP (4940 kg/ha; BC ratio 2.3), dichlorvos + emamectin benzoate 5 SG (4811 kg/ha; 2.5), and emamectin benzoate 5 SG (4677 kg/ha; BC ratio 2.6).

Small effects of livestock grazing intensification on diversity, abundance, and composition in a dryland plant community	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Livestock grazing is a globally important land use and has the potential to significantly influence plant community structure and ecosystem function, yet several critical knowledge gaps remain on the direction and magnitude of grazing impacts. Furthermore, much of our understanding of the long-term effects on plant community composition and structure are based on grazer exclusion experiments, which explicitly avoid characterizing effects along grazing intensity gradients. We sampled big sagebrush plant communities using 68 plots located along grazing intensity gradients to determine how grazing intensity influences multiple aspects of plant community structure over time. This was accomplished by sampling plant communities at different distances from 17 artificial watering sources, using distance from water and cow dung density as proxies for grazing intensity at individual plots. Total vegetation cover and total grass cover were negatively related to grazing intensity, and cover of annual forbs, exotic cover, and exotic richness were positively related to grazing intensity. In contrast, species richness and composition, bunchgrass biomass, shrub density and size, percentage cover of bare ground, litter, and biological soil crusts did not vary along our grazing intensity gradients, in spite of our expectations to the contrary. Our results suggest that the effects of livestock grazing over multiple decades (mean = 46 years) in our sites are relatively small, especially for native perennial species, and that the big sagebrush plant communities we sampled are somewhat resistant to livestock grazing. Collectively, our findings are consistent with existing evidence that indicates the stability of the big sagebrush plant functional type composition under current grazing management regimes.

Remote sensing shows potential for the quantification and monitoring of the SMC of palustrine wetlands; however, this technique remains to be assessed across a wetland-terrestrial gradient in South Africa. The ability of the Sentinel Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical sensors, which are freely available from the European Space Agency, were evaluated to predict SMC for a palustrine wetland and surrounding terrestrial areas in the grassland biome of South Africa. The percentage of volumetric water content (%VWC) was measured across the wetland and terrestrial areas of the Colbyn Wetland Nature Reserve, located in the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality of the Gauteng Province, using a handheld SMT-100 soil moisture meter at a depth of 5 cm during the peak and end of the hydroperiod in 2018. The %VWC was regressed against the Sentinel imagery, using random forest, simple linear and support vector machine regression models. Random forest yielded the highest prediction accuracies in comparison to the other models. The results indicate that the Sentinel images have the potential to be used to predict SMC with a high coefficient of determination (Sentinel-1 SAR = R-2>0.9; Sentinel-2 optical = R-2>0.9) and a relatively low root mean square error (Sentinel-1 RMSE = <17%; Sentinel-2 optical = RMSE <21%). Predicted maps show higher ranges of SMC for wetlands (> 50%VWC; p<0.05) compared to terrestrial areas, and therefore SMC monitoring may benefit the inventorying of wetlands, as well as monitoring of their extent and ecological condition. Significance: The freely available and space-borne Sentinel sensors show potential for the quantification of surface soil moisture across a wetland-terrestrial gradient. Significant differences between the surface soil moisture of palustrine wetlands and terrestrial areas, imply that inventorying and monitoring of the extent and hydroperiod of palustrine wetlands can potentially be done.

J	Song, SY; Yu, DY; Li, XY				Song, Shuyu; Yu, Deyong; Li, Xinyu			Impacts of changes in climate and landscape pattern on soil conservation services in a dryland landscape	CATENA												Changes in climatic factors and landscape pattern are generally considered the main drivers of soil conservation services (SC). However, the influence mechanism of climatic factors and landscape pattern on SC is scale and landscape context-dependent. Disentangling the role of individual and joint climatic and landscape pattern factors in affecting the variation of SC is important to making a rational land use development scheme. In this study, Ordos, a typical arid and semiarid region of China suffering serious soil loss in terms of water erosion and wind erosion resulting from climate change and unreasonable human activities, was selected to analyze the changing trends of soil conservation services through water erosion suppression and wind erosion suppression (hereafter called SCWA and SCWI) from 2001 to 2016. We further explored spatial heterogeneity of the impacts of various drivers on SC using stepwise regression and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models at the watershed and township scales, respectively. The results showed that SCWA did not change significantly, while SCWI had a downward trend. The effects of driving factors on SC varied substantially across the study area, with climatic factors dominating. As the scale changed from watershed to township, the driving mechanism was explained more comprehensively and effectively, and the impacts of landscape pattern became more evident. Given the effectiveness and operability of landscape management, the township was suggested to serve as the best control unit when making landscape governance schemes in terms of improving SCWA and SCWI. The re-sults of this study are insightful for other regions with a fragile ecological environment to restore degraded ecosystems on the one hand and utilize land resources more sustainably on the other hand.					zhang, shuai/IVU-7877-2023														0341-8162	1872-6887				MAR	2023	222								106869	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106869	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106869		DEC 2022											WOS:000906583700001

Root endophytic bacterial and fungal communities in a natural hot desert are differentially regulated in dry and wet seasons by stochastic processes and functional traits	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Dryland ecosystems experience seasonal cycles of severe drought and moderate precipitation. Desert plants may develop symbiotic relationships with root endophytic microbes to survive under the repeated wet and extremely dry conditions. Although community coalescence has been found in many systems, the colonization by functional microbes and its relationship to seasonal transitions in arid regions are not well understood. Here we examined root endophytic microbial taxa, and their traits in relation to their root colonization, during the dry and wet seasons in a hot desert of the southwestern United States. We used high-throughput DNA sequencing of 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer gene profiling of five desert shrubs, and analyzed the seasonal change in endophytic microbial lineages. Goodness of fit to the neutral community model in relationship to microbial traits was evaluated. In summer, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidia increased, although this was not genus-specific. For fungi, Glomeraceae selectively increased in summer. In winter, Gram-negative bacterial genera, including those capable of nitrogen fixation and plant growth promotion, increased. Neutral model analysis revealed a strong stochastic influence on endophytic bacteria but a weak effect for fungi, especially in summer. The taxa with higher frequency than that predicted by neutral model shared environmental adaptability and symbiotic traits, whereas the frequency of pathogenic fungi was at or under the predicted value. These results suggest that community assembly of bacteria and fungi is regulated differently. The bacterial community was affected by stochastic and deterministic processes via bacterial response to drought (response trait), beneficial effect on plants (effect trait), and likely stable mutualistic interactions with plants suggested by the frequency of nodule bacteria. For fungi, mycorrhizal fungi were selected by plants in summer. The regulation of beneficial microbes by plants in both dry and wet seasons suggests the presence of plant-soil positive feedback in this natural desert ecosystem.

Studying the properties of their soils and their carbon sequestration characteristics is a key step as a major contribution for their conservation to cope with the global warming issue. Considering the geographical position of Tunisia, most of its territory is in the dryland zone with a deficit in water balance, and half of its area is only occupied by Lithosols and Regosols. These soils and despite their existence in dry climates are either pastureland or agricultural land, they play a considerable role for the peasants; however, their organic carbon stocks remain little studied and not well known. The present work focuses on the state of the carbon stock in the Regosols of Tunisia. Two study sites were studied; the first was a Regosol in Gafsa under arid climate, the second, another Regosol in Kairouan under semiarid climate. In these two sites, we also have two different modes of land use. In fact, in each site, we have a plot in an olive grove adjacent to another in a pastoral mode. Results showed that soil particle size, pH, and bulk density were very close. The difference was observed in the content of organic carbon and therefore in organic carbon stock. In olive groves, the organic carbon stocks of the soil, 1-m deep, were 8.22 (+/- 0.72) Kg.C.m(-2) in Gafsa and 12 (+/- 0.46) Kg.C.m(-2) in Kairouan. This increase mainly concerned the surface layers (0-20 cm) and the deepest layers (80-100 cm). By comparing the carbon stocks of soils under olive groves with those under pasture, the gain in 15 years varied between 1.48 and 2.46 Kg.C.m(-2). These results prove the low organic matter content of Regosols from North Africa, but on the other hand, their great capacity to sequester organic carbon. These same soils, if organically amended, could be fertile and productive soils, but also, could act as a carbon sink to cope with global warming.

Consistent microbial and nutrient resource island patterns during monsoon rain in a Chihuahuan Desert bajada shrubland	ECOSPHERE												In dryland soils, spatiotemporal variation in surface soils (0-10 cm) plays an important role in the function of the "critical zone" that extends from canopy to groundwater. Understanding connections between soil microbes and biogeochemical cycling in surface soils requires repeated multivariate measurements of nutrients, microbial abundance, and microbial function. We examined these processes in resource islands and interspaces over a two-month period at a Chihuahuan Desert bajada shrubland site. We collected soil in Prosopis glandulosa (honey mesquite), Larrea tridentata (creosote bush), and unvegetated (interspace) areas to measure soil nutrient concentrations, microbial biomass, and potential soil enzyme activity. We monitored the dynamics of these belowground processes as soil conditions dried and then rewetted due to rainfall. Most measured variables, including inorganic nutrients, microbial biomass, and soil enzyme activities, were greater under shrubs during both wet and dry periods, with the highest magnitudes under mesquite followed by creosote bush and then interspace. One exception was nitrate, which was highly variable and did not show resource island patterns. Temporally, rainfall pulses were associated with substantial changes in soil nutrient concentrations, though resource island patterns remained consistent during all phases of the soil moisture pulse. Microbial biomass was more consistent than nutrients, decreasing only when soils were driest. Potential enzyme activities were even more consistent and did not decline in dry periods, potentially helping to stimulate observed pulses in CO2 efflux following rain events observed at a co-located eddy flux tower. These results indicate a critical zone with organic matter cycling patterns consistently elevated in shrub resource islands (which varied by shrub species), high decomposition potential that limits soil organic matter accumulation across the landscape, and nitrate fluxes that are decoupled from the organic matter pathways.

J	Souza, J; Hooke, J				Souza, Jonas; Hooke, Janet			Influence of seasonal vegetation dynamics on hydrological connectivity in tropical drylands	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Seasonally dry forests in tropical regions show over 300% inter-annual biomass variability that directly affects the runoff and erosion dynamics. However, biomass fluctuation is mostly overlooked in hydrosedimentological analysis, including in connectivity analysis. The aim of this paper is to understand how the dryland vegetation seasonality in Brazilian drylands affects the potential runoff and sediment connectivity using the Index of Connectivity (stream and outlet targets). Two main analytical steps were used to identify the influence of dry forest biomass fluctuation on connectivity: Creation of vegetation scenarios based on the relationship between rainfall patterns and NDVI fluctuations (Landsat images); Identification of the effect of the vegetation scenarios on Index of Connectivity. The method was applied to a 90 km(2) watershed in NE Brazil, creating a daily vegetation classification using five vegetation scenarios related to rainfall parameters, with average NDVI values from 0.18 during very dry scenarios (<20 mm of antecedent rainfall) to 0.62 in very wet scenario (>500 mm of antecedent rainfall). The primary connectivity behaviour is controlled by a continuous connectivity decrease, reaching 32%, related to increase of humidity and vegetation biomass. At the same time, due to rainfall irregularity, high magnitude rainfall events can occur even during very dry scenarios, when the watershed shows very high potential connectivity. It indicates that connectivity in runoff-dominated regions is temporally variable due to the highly seasonal vegetation and variable incidence of intense rainstorms.

Slow-release urea (SRU) or the combined application of slow-release urea and common urea could enhance N utilization, but this effect is limited and long-term N fertilizer application would lead to soil acidification. Biochar has the potential to effectively improve acid soil and increase N utilization efficiency. A pot experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of the combined application of biochar and different urea on the root morphology, grain yield, and nitrogen uptake and utilization of rapeseed. The two-factorial complete randomized block design was adopted with three schemes of urea (100% common urea, 100% slow-release urea, and 60% common urea and 40% slow-release urea, named UR, SRU, and combined (60%+40% SRU), respectively), and three biochar levels (0, 2 and 4% of the soil weight, named C0, C1 and C2, respectively). Biochar was found to significantly affect rapeseed root morphology, grain yield, nitrogen uptake and utilization when compared with no biochar, but these effects varied with different urea and biochar application rate. C1 combined with 60%+40% SRU significantly promoted the diameter of root crown, total root volume, average root diameter, total nitrogen accumulation (TNA), and nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE); C1 combined with UR also significantly increased the total root volume, total root length, and average root diameter of rapeseed. However, C2 combined with UR and 60%+40% SRU, and the combined application of biochar (C1 and C2) and SRU, had an inhibitory effect on root morphology, nitrogen uptake and utilization, and yield due to the slow release effect of biochar on available nitrogen. The diameter of root crown, total root volume, total root surface area, average root diameter, TNA, NUE, effective pod number, number of grains per pod, and yield were highest under the combined application of 60%+40% SRU and C1. NUE and yield of 60%+40% SRU+C1 treatment increased by 12.36-63.68% and 2.82-46.59%, respectively, than with urea application only. This combination may be an effective mean to further improve the yield and NUE of rapeseed in dryland in southwest China.

In global drylands and croplands, soil moisture is often a primary limiting factor to plant growth. Here we use the SIF retrievals from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) and soil moisture (SM) retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellites to study the soil moisture control on photosynthetic activity of global drylands and croplands. We primarily analyze the predawn SM control on daily peak photosynthetic activity using the morning SM observations from SMAP and the noon SIF observations from OCO-2. On global drylands (i.e., dry sub-humid, semi-arid, and arid zones) and majority of croplands, soil water content is typically low, moisture in the topsoil is critical for plant growth, and satellite-based SIF and SM observations are expected to have high retrieval accuracy. The SMAP SM retrievals show positive daily relationships with OCO-2 SIF for drylands and croplands of the tropics and Australia, where SM is expected to limit plant growth and concurrent data records are sufficient to make statistical inferences. Negative relationships between SIF and SM were observed in forested areas of mid-latitude dry subhumid zones with high average annual SM for which SIF showed a positive relationship with air temperature. The relationships between SM and SIF follow the expected spatial patterns, positive and stronger in drier and warmer regions whereas weaker and often negative in colder and wetter regions. We find strong evidence that the OCO-2 SIF is accurately capturing monthly SMAP SM dynamics particularly for regions with distinct seasonality of rainfall such as the Sub-Saharan North Africa, Indian subcontinent, and South African countries. These results indicate new opportunities for monitoring dryland and cropland productivity solely using satellite observed SIF and soil moisture data.

Using the Lund-Potsdam-Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ), this study investigated the potential effects of climate change and soil water content (SWC) on terrestrial ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE) across China from 1982 to 2060. The results revealed that: (1) WUE was higher in South China and Northeast China, but lower in Northwest China and it had shown a significant upward trend in the past 40 years, especially in Northwest China where grasslands were widely distributed. The increase in WUE was mainly closely related to the greening of vegetation. In the past 40 years, the area of net primary productivity (NPP), evapotranspiration (ET), and WUE showing an upward trend accounted for 85.85 %, 63.66 %, and 83.88 % of the total area of the country, respectively. Although ET also showed an increasing trend nationwide, the increase of NPP was more obvious; (2) The control experiment showed that WUE showed a significant increase trend in arid and semi-arid areas of Northwest China with the increase of CO2 concentration, while SWC showed a significant drying trend, but both WUE and SWC showed an increasing trend in humid areas. The sensitivity of WUE to SWC was enhanced in arid and semi-arid areas, and the effect of soil drought was partially offset by the increase of WUE; (3) Future climate projections also indicated that the CO2 fertilization effect will contribute to an increase in WUE while causing drier soil moisture conditions in the arid and semi-arid regions. Especially under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, CO2 fertilization in Northwest China contributed more than 14 % to WUE from 2015 to 2060, while the impact on SWC depletion exceeded 3 %. This highlights the potential implications of rising atmospheric CO2 concentration, as it may promote a significant rise in WUE and exacerbate the drying of soil moisture in these areas.

Separate experiments were conducted during the oat growing seasons (2020 and 2021) in which AM fungi inoculation with Rhizophagus intraradices was performed in soil with 75% and 55% relative water contents. In response to AM fungi inoculation under normal moisture, the infection rate was significantly higher than in water-limited regimes during both years. The AM fungi alleviated the negative effects of drought stress by influencing total N and P in oat soil, improving N contents in oat roots, stems, and ears, and accumulating more P in leaves. We also found that the promoting effect of AM fungi inoculation on accumulating N in various oat organs seemed to contribute more than that on P under drought stress. Above all, AM fungi significantly ameliorated the effects of drought stress and increased oat grain yield by 14.74% in 2020 and 14.20% in 2021. The soil total N was the key factor that affected oat grain yield, and N and P contents in various oat organs under drought stress and AM fungi inoculation. Based on these findings, AM fungi benefit oat nutrition and productivity and could improve oat performance in dryland agriculture.

We know that biocrusts are important modulators of the soil microbiomes, however, much less is known about how local conditions influence biocrust adaptation and subsequently alter the soil microbiomes.MethodsTo understand the effects of microhabitat on bacterial communities via changes in biocrust traits, we collected biocrusts and analyzed soil microbiomes from eight representative microhabitats present in a semiarid ecosystem from the Chinese Northern Loess Plateau. These microhabitats were located a) outside plant canopy on level land, on shady gentle slope, and sunny gentle slope; b) under plant canopy on level land, on shady gentle, and sunny gentle slope; and c) outside plant canopy on shady and sunny steep slope, respectively. We then used structural equation modeling to investigate the relative contribution of microhabitat factors on important bacterial community metrics through quantifying the changes in biocrust traits.ResultsObserved microhabitat conditions significantly (P & LE; 0.033) altered the traits of biocrusts (e.g., thickness, biomass, and chlorophyll content), which were associated with significant changes in the soil bacterial community. For example, the bacterial richness in biocrusts developing under plant canopy, on shady slopes, and on gentle slopes was 20.1%, 19.9%, and 15.4% higher than that of the biocrusts developing outside plant canopy, on sunny slopes, and on steep slopes, respectively. We further showed that microhabitat conditions significantly impacted the network structure of bacterial communities under biocrusts, and structural equation modeling revealed that microhabitat metrics had strong indirect effects on network connectivity through changing biocrust traits.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that microhabitat factors can strongly influence soil bacterial communities via the changes in locally-adapted biocrust traits and soil properties. This knowledge is critical to understand the impacts of changing environments on biocrusts and associated soil bacterial communities, particularly as climate change progresses.					; Xiao, Bo/F-9722-2013	DELGADO-BAQUERIZO, MANUEL/0000-0002-6499-576X; Xiao, Bo/0000-0002-9544-4207													0032-079X	1573-5036				2023 AUG 5	2023										10.1007/s11104-023-06184-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-023-06184-3		AUG 2023											WOS:001042791700002

The species is propagated primarily through seeds, with germination percentage ranging from 40-90%. Successful germination of seeds of forestry species requires skillful application of appropriate pre-sowing treatments. Studies that document and quantify the effect of skill/experience on the germination outcomes for tree seeds are rare. This study sought to fill this gap by documenting the results from a capacity building exercise on testing M. volkensii seeds. Seeds were collected from the KEFRI Kibwezi seed orchard, pretreated and sown by seven participants with different skill levels based on years of experience. The seeds were sown in glasshouse and nursery conditions. There were significant differences (p < 0.001) in germination capacity, mean germination time, T-50, mean germination rate, mean daily germination (MDG) and peak value (PV) depending on the skill level of the participants. The results also varied between germination environment (p < 0.001) for all germination traits except MGD and T-50. The highest germination outcomes were recorded for participants with the longest experience in testing of M. volkensii seed germination. These findings therefore signify the importance of skill/experience in germination of M. volkensii seeds, an outcome that may have implications for other forestry seeds with special pre-sowing requirements.						, Millicent/0000-0003-3606-763X													0251-0952	1819-5717				AUG	2023	51	2					259	265		10.15258/sst.2023.51.2.10	http://dx.doi.org/10.15258/sst.2023.51.2.10													WOS:001079736400010

The influence of flood frequency and duration on microcrustacean egg bank composition in dryland river floodplain sediments	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Several studies of temporary floodplain wetlands suggest that flood history is important to microcrustacean egg bank composition and hatching responses. However, these studies have largely focussed on contrasts among less frequently flooded areas (areas flooded every year to areas flooded once every 10-20 years) and less is known about variation at the more frequently flooded end of the gradient (from multiple floods per year to once every 2 years). Similarly, the effects of flood duration on egg banks have not been examined in detail. Thus, this study examines spatial variation in microcrustacean hatching at higher flood frequencies and in relation to inundation duration. Surface sediment samples were collected from dry anabranches of the Macintyre River floodplain in Australia during February 2018, with a range of flood frequency from approximately four times per year to one in 2 years. Anabranches were selected randomly from predefined flood frequency classes and clustered into three different flood history groups based on flood history variables. Soil samples were collected from deep and shallow locations within anabranches, with depth assumed to be a proxy for the duration of inundation. Sediment samples were inundated in mesocosms and hatched microcrustaceans sampled over 6 weeks. Microcrustacean abundance and assemblage composition varied by sites, relative depth, and duration of inundation. There was no variation by flood history groups. Highest numbers hatched from the deeper areas of anabranches, which is assumed to reflect differences in the egg banks of deep and shallow areas due to the longer duration of inundation in deeper areas. Duration also influenced hatching response from the egg bank, with more microcrustaceans hatching per unit time in the first 2 and final 2 weeks of the 6-week trial than the middle 2 weeks. Species richness also varied by relative depth and duration of inundation with more taxa hatching from the deeper areas of anabranches. The study highlights the critical influence of flood duration on hatching patterns of microcrustaceans from inundated sediments. Therefore, changes to flood duration have the potential to influence microcrustacean assemblages and thus further changes to trophic interactions in temporary floodplain wetlands.

Land degradation effects on composition of pioneering soil communities: An alternative successional sequence for dryland cyanobacterial biocrusts	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												In drylands, soil surfaces in interplant spaces are usually covered by biocrusts, which consist of communities of heterotrophic and chemoautotrophic bacteria, cyanobacteria, mosses, lichens, microalgae, fungi and other organisms. Cyanobacteria are of special interest because of their capacity to promote biocrust succession or increase soil fertility and stability. Therefore, some studies have analyzed their communities in different ecosystems, focusing on how different factors, such as temperature or altitude, influence their composition. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, the relationship between ecosystem degradation and cyanobacterial community composition has not yet been studied in depth. This could be determinant for the successful development of tools for restoring degraded biocrusts by cyanobacterial inoculation. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze the effect of the ecosystem degradation level on cyanobacteria composition from topsoil communities, where they are keystone pioneering organisms. To do this, we analyzed the cyanobacterial diversity by molecular sequencing (16S rRNA gene) of the DNA extracted from biocrusts at different developmental stages, which were collected from three ecosystems in southeastern Spain. The selected ecosystems represent different "land-condition" states as a result of degradation processes. In one of them soil was removed by mining (the G.ador quarry), the second is a natural badland area (El Cautivo) where water erosion is intense, and the third ecosystem is a well-preserved area (Balsa Blanca). Our findings show that cyanobacterial richness decreases (up to 28 OTUs) as degradation increases and biocrust developmental stage decreases. Also, the relative abundances of most of the species were significantly correlated with the degradation state of the sampling site, either showing a positive or negative trend. Two of the species which increased in abundance with site degradation, and were especially abundant in incipient biocrusts, were Leptolyngbya frigida and Trichocoleus desertorum, while other species, also showing an increase in abundance with degradation, but having a higher relative abundance in most developed biocrusts, were Nostoc commune, Tolypothrix distorta and Scytonema sp. The significant correlation of these species with degradation at different biocrusts developmental stages, suggests an alternative developmental sequence for drylands, at least in more degraded ecosystems. In less degraded ones, the composition of the major cyanobacterial groups followed the common pattern of bundle-forming cyanobacteria (54.7%) pertaining to the Microcoleus genus followed by other non-heterocystous filamentous (17.4%), unicellular/colonial (7.5%) and heterocystous cyanobacteria (1.1%). In comparison, the cyanobacterial groups dominating the most incipient biocrusts, colonizing the most degraded soil, were the filamentous non-heterocystous (50.7%) and the bundle-forming cyanobacteria (48.9%). Therefore, our results show that some cyanobacterial species, which do not belong to traditional pioneer genera, are frequent colonizers of degraded soils, and then, they could be potentially used for producing a more efficient inoculum for inducing biocrust formation and restoring degraded soils. Finally, it is also remarkable that L. frigida appears as dominant in some biocrusts from drylands (up to 74.9% of abundance) being therefore demonstrated its wide distribution in nonpolar biomes and its capacity to also inhabit degraded arid soils.

Grain-size variability of point-bar deposits from a fine-grained dryland river terminus, Southern Altiplano, Bolivia	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Point-bar deposits exhibiting fining-upward grain-size trends arc widely documented from both modem rivers and ancient preserved successions. However, in some mud-dominated sedimentary systems this common pattern may not occur; rather, alternative coarsening-upward trends can develop. We investigated point-bar deposits in the mud-dominated river terminus (median value (D-50) < 55 mu m) of the meandering Rio Colorado in Bolivia's southern Altiplano, a semi-arid endorheic basin. Grain-size trends were investigated using double random grain-size distribution (GSD) measurements and end-member modelling analyses (EMMA), as well as detailed mineralogical analyses (XRD and LOI). These methods revealed an upward-coarsening trend of point-bar deposits in terms of D-50 of GSD and in proportions of coarse sediment for two (C2 and C0) of three chronologically different meandering channels in the river terminus. Those of another abandoned channel (C1) were, by contrast, dominated by a fining-upward trend. The deposits in channel C2 were characterised by a lower content of organic matter and carbonate compared with those of the other two channels. A novel conceptual model for the formation of coarsening-upward point-bar deposits is proposed. The model implies the action of low-frequency, high-magnitude floods during an overall hyper-arid period when sediment supply to the river terminus is dominated by clay and fine silt. A temporal trend toward higher magnitude and longer duration flood events allows for the transport coarser-grained sediments further down system toward the river terminus where deposition occurs on the inner bend of meandering channels. Successive accretion layers within the point-bar deposits record a coarsening upward trend. Results demonstrate how a coarsening-upward succession of point-bar deposits in the muddy river terminus of a semi-arid endorheic basin can contribute to improved understanding of mechanisms of deposition in fine-grained fluvial systems. Our results contribute to an improved understanding of the varied processes and sedimentology of very line-grained meandering river terminus systems in semi-arid or arid endorheic basins; the results additionally provide insight to enable improved interpretations of rock record examples of pre-vegetation rivers on Earth and other planetary bodies.

Quantifying atmospheric N deposition in dryland ecosystems: A test of the Integrated Total Nitrogen Input (ITNI) method	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Estimating nitrogen (N) deposition to terrestrial ecosystems is complicated by the multiple forms and routes of N loading from the atmosphere. We used the integrated total nitrogen input (ITNI) method, which is based on the principle of isotope dilution within a plant-liquid-sand system, to quantify N inputs to coastal sage scrub ecosystems in Riverside, California. Using the ITNI method, we measured atmospheric N deposition of 29.3 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) over a range of aboveground plant biomass of 228 to 424 g m(-2). From 85 to 96% of the atmospheric N inputs were taken up by plants in the ITNI modules with most of the assimilation mediated by, and stored in, aboveground biomass. Parallel measurements using conventional approaches yielded deposition rates of 25.2 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) when using the inferential method and 4.8 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) using throughfall collectors. The relatively low throughfall estimates were attributed to canopy retention of inorganic N, low rainfall, and to the fact that the throughfall flux data did not include organic N and stomatal uptake of N gases. Also, during dry periods, frequent watering of ITNI modules may have increased stomatal conductance and led to overestimates of N deposition. Across published studies that used the ITNI method, areal N deposition rates varied by similar to 40-fold, were positively correlated with plant biomass and 90% of the variability in measured deposition rates can be explained by plant biomass production. The ITNI method offers a holistic approach to measuring atmospheric N deposition in arid ecosystems, although more study is needed to understand how watering rates effect N deposition measurements.

However, synchronously enhancing grain yield (GY) and GPC is still challenging due to the physiological competition between carbon and nitrogen. This study determined plant and soil nutrients and surveyed yield and management data from 304 wheat fields at three locations on the Loess Plateau of China to explore limitations and design practices for producing high-yielding and high-protein wheat sustainably. Based on the overall average GY (4732 kg ha-1) and GPC (13.1%), the surveyed fields were grouped into low yield & low protein (LyLp), low yield & high protein (LyHp), high yield & low protein (HyLp), and high yield & high protein (HyHp), with average GYs of 3625, 3653, 5912, and 5962 kg ha-1 and GPCs of 11.2%, 15.2%, 11.7%, and 14.9%, respectively. The GY has significant positive correlations with cultivar release year (r = 0.192), plant density (r = 0.204), and soil total nitrogen (r = 0.131), a negative correlation with sowing date (r = -0.257), but no correlations with fertilizer rates and soil available nutrients of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Nitrogen and potassium requirements in HyHp fields were 25.1% and 16.4% higher than that in HyLp fields. Accordingly, HyHp fields had significant higher nitrogen and potassium fertilizer rates and soil nitrogen and potassium sup-plies than HyLp fields. Structural equation modelling showed that cultivar release year contributed the most to the GY variations, while soil available potassium has the largest effect on the GPC. In addition, soil nitrogen surplus was approximately 50% decreased from low-to high-yielding fields, but did not differ between HyLp and HyHp fields. These findings indicate that the integrated crop and soil management strategies, including improved newer cultivar, timely sowing date, advisable plant density and fertilizer rates, and adequate soil nutrients supply, are applicable for the complicated and changeable wheat production environments to improve GY and GPC synchronously.

Because of their reliance on passive dispersal to migrate from areas where conditions have become unfavourable, plants are particularly susceptible. On dryland river floodplains, the species diversity of herbaceous annuals is often high while that of structurally dominant woody perennials is low. We examined gene flow genetic structure and dispersal in Acacia stenophylla, a small perennial tree widely distributed throughout river systems of inland Australia. The role of the river corridor in shaping patterns of gene flow and genetic structure is also investigated. Location Murray-Darling Basin, south eastern Australia Methods A total of 127 individuals, from 12 subpopulations located on seven rivers were genotyped at 13 microsatellite loci. Several population and landscape genetic tools were applied to the microsatellite data to evaluate spatial patterns of gene flow and genetic structure and make inferences regarding possible modes of dispersal. Results High gene flow and weak genetic structure was identified for the 12 subpopulations of A. stenophylla sampled, a surprising result given large distances between subpopulations. Pairwise genetic distance between subpopulations was low to moderate and could largely be explained (R-2 = 0.68) by two variables: distance along the river and the proportion of no flow days. structure analysis revealed two genetic clusters. Subpopulations located on the Darling and Lower Balonne rivers were dominated by cluster one while subpopulations from the Warrego and Paroo rivers showed largely mixed ancestry with individuals descending from both clusters one and two. Main Conclusions These results indicate that the river corridor facilitates extensive gene flow between subpopulations of A. stenophylla in this system. Hydrochory appears to be the dominant process; however, upstream movements of propagules most probably via animal movement are sufficient to negate effects expected under unidirectional dispersal.

Due to the flashy nature of ephemeral flow regimes, opportunities to directly investigate the influence of wood in ephemeral channels are limited. Additionally, given prior studies showing a strong association between existing riparian vegetation and large wood deposition in ephemeral streams, the geomorphic impact of wood is entangled with that of vegetation. Here, we develop a hydro-morphodynamic model to investigate changes to channel and floodplain morphology due to wood and vegetation in an ephemeral stream in southeastern Arizona, USA. Three scenarios are modeled: the actual configuration of the river corridor; an experiment in which jams are removed; and an experiment in which vegetation is removed. Both large wood and vegetation effectively confined flow to the main, unvegetated channel, which became wider and deeper over the course of a single moderate flood. When isolating the impact of large wood, model results show that wood enhances channel change created by vegetation, resulting in & PLUSMN;0.1 to 0.3 m of additional scour or aggradation. The simulated removal of vegetation resulted in more channel change than the removal of wood alone, partially because vegetation occupies a much greater area within the stream corridor than large wood. We propose a conceptual framework where large wood could mediate sedimentation as well as the recruitment and growth of vegetation in ephemeral streams, contributing to the evolution of ephemeral stream morphology over time.

J	Zhang, JZ				Zhang, Junzhe			A new ecological-wind erosion model to simulate the impacts of aeolian transport on dryland vegetation patterns	ACTA ECOLOGICA SINICA												Drylands cover more than 40% of the land surface of the Earth and are characterized by patchy vegetation and that permits erosion of the surface. Vegetation-aeolian transport is an important feedback in drylands, particularly those undergoing shrub encroachment. Although one side of the feedback, the influence of vegetation loss on aeolian transport, has been well studied, the other, the influence of aeolian transport on existing vegetation, has been never studied in detail. In this study, a new ecological-wind erosion model (ECO-WEMO) that contains an aeolian transport component was created to simulate how aeolian transport impacts vegetation pattern and causes the state change. Two modeling scenarios were investigated: 1) stable grass and shrub communities without/with aeolian transport and 2) unstable shrub and grass communities without/with aeolian transport disturbed by different drought conditions. The first scenario focuses on the simulation of the influence of aeolian transport on vegetation communities and the second scenario focuses on the simulation of the state change of vegetation communities. The results from the first scenario show that: First, the mean biomasses of grass and shrub become consistent in the case of no wind in both shrub-dominated and grass-dominated communities. Second, the mean biomass of shrub becomes higher than the grass in the case of wind in shrub-dominated communities and the mean biomass of grass becomes higher than the shrub in the case of wind in grass-dominated communities. Third, the dust flux of shrub-dominated communities is higher than the grass-dominated communities. Fourth, the net change in surface height in shrub-dominated communities has a considerably higher range than in grass-dominated communities. Fifth, the spatial pattern of shrub-dominated communities is sparser than the spatial pattern of grass in the vegetation communities in the case of wind. The results from the second scenario show that: First, the state change only took place from grass-dominated communities to shrub dominated communities in the condition of drought. Second, the state change only took place in the case of wind. Third, the state change didn't take place after the slight and moderate droughts but only took place after the drought. Fourth, large vegetation biomass reduction only took place in the case of wind after the severe drought. Our results confirm, in a modeling context, the important role that aeolian transport can play in vegetation dynamics and state change in deserts. (c) 2020 Ecological Society of China.

Lithology and coarse fraction adjusted bulk density estimates for determining total organic carbon stocks in dryland soils	GEODERMA												Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) have been developed to estimate soil fine fraction bulk density (BDFF) using the relationships with soil organic carbon content (SOC) and particle size distribution. Current PTF's overlook the influence of lithology on BDFF estimations. In this study, we examine this influence by developing two PTF's for total bulk density (BDT), which includes both fine (FF) and coarse fragments (CF), using measured percent SOC in soils derived from felsic and mafic lithologies (90 felsic and 52 mafic, 142 total). Our results show that SOC is highly correlated with BDT in soils derived from felsic (R-2 value of 0.79, p < 0.0001) and mafic (R-2 value of 0.84, p < 0.0001) material and that the relationships for these two lithologies are highly distinctive. In addition, we adjust estimated BDT with soil pedon CF content (> 2 mm) to determine estimated BDFF. We use an independently collected validation subset of 70 samples to compare our model against 23 published PTFs. When accounting for lithological differences in BDT and adjusting for site-specific CF content, which is highly variable vertically and horizontally within the watershed, we observe substantial improvements (average of 10.05 +/- 4.89%) in BDFF estimation and associated errors compared to other PTFs. Findings from our study demonstrate that incorporating both lithology and CF content into site-specific empirical relationships can provide reliable BDFF and consequently soil carbon stock estimates.

FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Rice-wheat (RW) cropping systems are integral to global food security. Despite being practiced for decades, Chinese RW cropping systems often suffer from low productivity and poor nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), reflecting management approaches that are not well-contextualized to region and season. Here, we develop the best management guides for N fertilizer in RW systems that are designed to help raise the productivity, NUE, and environmental sustainability of winter wheat over the long term. 2-year field experiments were conducted with four N fertilizer rates (0, 135, 180, and 225 kg N ha(-1)), allowing contrasts of yields, soil moisture, and NUE of wheat in RW in the humid climates zones on the Jianghan Plain. We compared RW systems with soybean/maize dryland wheat (DW) systems that are similarly endemic to China: after soybean/maize is harvested, soils are often drier compared with moisture content following rice harvest. With high seasonal N application rates (180-225 kg N ha(-1)), wheat crop yields increased by 24% in RW which were greater than comparable yields of wheat in DW, mainly due to greater kernels per spike in the former. Across treatments and years, N accumulation in plant tissue and kernel dry matter of DW was higher than that in RW, although mean agronomic efficiency of nitrogen (AE(N)) and physiological efficiency of nitrogen (PEN) of RW systems were greater. As N application rates increased from 135 to 225 kg ha(-1), AE(N) and PEN of DW decreased but changed little for RW. Soil ammonium N was much lower than that of nitrate N; changes in NH4+ and NO3- as a consequence of increasing N fertilization were similar for RW and DW. We recommend that tactical application of N fertilizer continue seasonally until midgrain filling for both the DW and RW systems. At fertilization rates above 180 kg N ha(-1), yield responses disappeared but nitrate leaching increased significantly, suggesting declining environmental sustainability above this N ceiling threshold. Collectively, this study elicits many functional and agronomic trade-offs between yields, NUE, and environmental sustainability as a function of N fertilization. Our results show that yield and NUE responses measured as part of crop rotations are both more robust and more variable when derived over multiple seasons, management conditions, and sites.

Because paddy rice is a major summer crop in Egypt and it consumes the greatest amount of water in comparison with other crops, the authors focused on monitoring and evaluating the irrigation practices of farmers during summer and examined the extent of sufficient and equitable water distribution in the Dakalt branch canal. Three tertiary canals that had been improved under IIP were selected from upstream, midstream, and downstream along the Dakalt branch canal. Two, three, and one pumping stations were selected from the upstream, midstream, and downstream, respectively, for monitoring pump operations in order to quantify the water supply. Cropping patterns and pump operation records were collected. The irrigation water requirement for each crop was estimated using the UN Food and Agriculture Organization Penman-Monteith method. Water sufficiency (WS), which is the ratio of water supply to water demand, was then calculated, and equitable water distribution among the tertiary canals was assessed based on these results. The mean WS during the mid-irrigation season of June, July, and August for two years at the downstream tertiary canal was 0.75, which was considered to be poor sufficiency, whereas the mean WS values at the upstream and midstream tertiary canals were 0.93 and 0.93, respectively, which were considered to be good sufficiency. The downstream tertiary canal received less water than required compared with the others, and this insufficient and inequitable supply affected rice yields because the average yield downstream in 2013 and 2014 was 7.6 t ha(-1), while those for upstream and midstream were 10.0 and 10.5 t ha(-1), respectively; this difference was significant. However, WS downstream of the upstream tertiary canal in 2013 and WS upstream of the midstream tertiary canal in 2014 were below 0.8. This was attributed to a drastic change in the cropping pattern at the tertiary canal level and to the insufficient water supply to the tertiary canals.

As Indian farmers growing rainfed crops are small landholders, their better option is in situ rainwater harvesting. This ensures moisture storage and increases soil moisture available to rainfed crops with less-costly investment. Accordingly, a field investigation was established over 2011, 2012 and 2013 at the Dryland Agricultural Research Station, Chettinad, India. We studied the effects of seedbed preparation method (SBPM) and mulching with crop residues (CRM) on soil physicochemical properties, growth, yield and yield attributes of groundnut. Greater soil moisture content was measured under compartmental bunding (CB) and raised bed (RB) with CRM than under flatbed (FB). Soil bulk density was considerably smaller under CB and RB with CRM (1.36 and 1.37 Mg m(-3)) compared with FB (1.39 Mg m(-3)). Soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) was larger under CB and RB with CRM (563 and 542 mg kg(-1)soil, respectively) than FB with and without CRM. RB with CRM application contained more soil organic carbon (SOC) stock (3.1 Mg ha(-1)) than FB. CB with CRM resulted in larger groundnut yield (1,604 kg ha(-1)) and rainwater use efficiency (5.8 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)) than the FB with and without CRM; RB and RF with CRM were intermediate. The ideal seedbed preparation for groundnut crop in Alfisol under semi-arid conditions was compartmental bunding (CB) and raised bed (RB) along with CRM.					c, swaminathan/V-2838-2019	c, swaminathan/0000-0003-1206-1452; Pandian, Kannan/0000-0001-7003-3535													0266-0032	1475-2743				JUL	2021	37	3					479	493		10.1111/sum.12622	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sum.12622		SEP 2020											WOS:000568588900001

Sentinel-2-based predictions of soil depth to inform water and nutrient retention strategies in dryland wheat	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												The thickness or depth of fine-textured soil (z(f)) dominates water storage capacity and exerts a control on nutrient leaching in semi-arid agroecosystems. At small pixel sizes (< 1 m; 'fine resolution'), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of cereal crops during senescence (Zadoks Growth Stages [ZGS] 90-93) offers a promising alternative to destructive sampling of z(f) using soil pits. However, it is unclear whether correlations between z(f) and NDVI exist (a) at larger pixel sizes (1-10 m; 'intermediate resolution') and (b) across field boundaries. The relationship of z(f) to NDVI o(f) wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was tested using images from a combination of multispectral sensors and fields in central Montana. NDVI was derived for one field using sensors of fine and intermediate spatial resolution and for three fields using intermediate resolution sensors only. Among images acquired during crop senescence, z(f) was correlated with NDVI (p < 0.05) independent of sensor (p = 0.22) and field (p = 0.94). The z(f) relationship to NDVI was highly dependent on acquisition day (p < 0.05), but only when pre-senescence (ZGS <= 89) images were included in the analysis. Results indicate that cereal crop NDVI of intermediate resolution can be used to characterize z(f) across field boundaries if image acquisition occurs during crop senescence. Based on these findings, an empirical index was derived from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery to estimate z(f) on fields in and beyond the study area.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				NOV 1	2023	289								108524	10.1016/j.agwat.2023.108524	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2023.108524		SEP 2023											WOS:001084565500001

A four-year field experiment was conducted in a randomized block design on the Loess Plateau of northwestern China in 2015-2019, which aimed to study the effects of straw strip mulching (SSM) and conventional flat planting without mulching (CK) on soil water storage, water consumption characteristics, water use efficiency, precipitation use efficiency, winter wheat growth, economic benefits, and nutrient benefits. The results obtained for the four years showed that the SSM treatment improved soil water storage in the 0-180 cm soil layer over the whole growth period, which was especially obvious in the 0-60 cm soil layer at the jointing and blooming stages. Compared with CK, SSM increased the contribution rate of precipitation to total evapotranspiration and increased it quite significantly by 20.4 percentage points in the earlier growth period. SSM significantly reduced soil water storage consumption in the 0-180 cm soil layer and ultimately reduced evapotranspiration by 11.2 mm during the whole period. In the 0-180 cm soil layer, SSM decreased evapotranspiration by 33.1 mm from the sowing to the jointing stages, but increased it by 19.5 mm from the jointing to the blooming stages. In addition, SSM improved the water use efficiency of grain yield by 21.6% and improved the precipitation use efficiency of grain yield by 18.6%, and it ultimately increased grain yield by 16.5% through improving spike number by 9.5% and kernel number per spike by 8.9%. SSM improved the water use efficiency of biomass yield by 13.5% and the precipitation use efficiency of biomass yield by 9.9%, and it ultimately increased biomass yield by 8.7% and plant height by 6.5%. Furthermore, SSM increased net income by 413 CNY ha-1 and the total amount of straw returned to the field after harvest by 8 876-9 619 kg ha(-1). After returning straw to the field, SSM significantly increased the soil nutrient contents, which could significantly reduce the burden of fertilization by farmers after a few years. Therefore, straw strip mulching technology could probably be a sustainable and potentially useful practice, which could save water and increase efficiency in rainfed winter wheat production.																			2095-3119					DEC	2022	21	12					3556	3568		10.1016/j.jia.2022.08.098	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jia.2022.08.098		DEC 2022											WOS:000907586400011

A promising rehabilitation package using mechanized micro-catchment water harvesting, to support the development of out-planted native shrub seedlings, is being introduced in Jordan's Badia. However, the impacts of rehabilitation on the soil microbial communities through the changes in soil physicochemical properties, and microbial potential contribution to soil function and stability are unclear. In the present study, soil microbial properties (abundance, community structure, community composition, diversity, network complexity, and decomposition function) and their relations with selected physicochemical properties (moisture, pH, salinity, and organic matter quantity and quality) were investigated in the micro-catchment water harvesting bunds in comparison with those in untreated interspace areas four years after implementation. At the bunds, fungal and bacterial abundances increased significantly, as did prokaryotic diversity, prokaryotic function to produce decomposing enzymes, and the redundancy of these functions. Furthermore, Burkholderiales (plant growth-promoting bacteria) and Cytophagales (cellulolytic bacteria) increased in the bunds. Enhanced soil moisture, through the rehabilitation, was likely a key for the improvements of the microbiota, including the increases in the abundances of fungi and the specific bacteria (Burkholderiales and Cytophagales), most of the decomposition function, and the functional redundancy. Furthermore, the decrease in salinity due to leaching resultant from the infiltration of collected surface runoff at the bunds likely supported an increase in diversity and parts of the function. The results suggest that the rehabilitation has multiple beneficial impacts on soil microbial communities, which further contribute to long-term ecosystem functionality and stability.					taniguchi, takeshi/AAG-5450-2021	taniguchi, takeshi/0000-0001-7386-1117; Tatsumi, Chikae/0000-0001-7191-6049; Haddad, Mira/0000-0002-9450-1599													0929-1393	1873-0272				AUG	2021	164								103938	10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.103938	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.103938		MAR 2021											WOS:000656562800003

Despite the support from multiple development institutions and households' willingness to address food security, hunger and malnutrition continue to challenge many vulnerable households. This study aims to analyze household livelihood strategies toward food security and assess factors determining their resilience. To address the issue, cluster analysis and the principal component analysis were used to identify the different livelihood strategies and to construct a resilience index, respectively. Regression analysis was used to identify the most significant factors determining households' resilience. The results indicate there were six different household types-pastoralist-extensive agriculturalists, farmers, agro-pastoralists, public service employees, entrepreneurs and wage employees-however, the majority of households obtained their livelihood from both agriculture and livestock (agro-pastoral systems). The principal component analysis highlighted that the pastoralist-extensive agriculturalists are the most resilient followed by public service employees, while households focused on wage labor are the least resilient, followed by entrepreneurs. In terms of gender, the study reveals that households headed by men are more resilient than those headed by women. However, the resilience components including income and food access, assets and adaptive capacity are the most correlated with the households' resilience to food insecurity. Furthermore, the regression analysis results reveal that the household size, crop production, farming experience, livestock size and number of coping strategies are the most significant factors determining household resilience to food insecurity. Consequently, to face the challenges of climate change and food security, rational investments in agriculture are necessary to transit rural household land-use practices to climate-smart agriculture.

Using as a case study a region where the lethal control of native puma and culpeo foxes has been incentivised via legislation for over 50 years, we examined how this policy has affected institutional narratives in the region. We conducted four key informant interviews with members of relevant institutions to establish their perspectives on carnivore management. We also examined the informational basis for the current legislative approach to predation, and identified topics for discussion surrounding legislation and its formation for decision-makers in the province. We identified a duality where two branches of gove rnment have contradictory policies regarding livestock production and carnivore management. All institutions involved in predation management in rural landscapes produced narratives supporting sustainable development, and suggested, in varying degrees, that alternatives to lethal control would be positive. Interviewees stated that modification of the existing laws require livestock producers to demand a change from policy-makers, who generally view carnivores poorly. Furthermore, there is evidence that discussions surrounding management strategies suffer from cultural bias, with rural inhabitants finding themselves marginalised from the decision-making process. We identified a need for empathy regarding the adverse situation of rural inhabitants facing the impacts of predation, and an appreciation of the role that carnivores play within their environments, so as to change the negative discourse surrounding human-carnivore interactions.

Field experiments were conducted in 2014 and 2015 in two different locations (Tehran and Mashhad Provinces, Iran). The experiments were laid out in a randomized complete block design comprised of four treatments, including control that is, neither ridge-furrow planting system nor wheat straw mulching (RF0M0); ridge-furrow planting system without wheat straw mulching (RF1M0); ridge-furrow planting system with wheat straw mulching only covering 50% of the soil surface (RF1M50); and ridge-furrow planting system with full covering (100%) of the soil surface with wheat straw mulch (RF1M100). The RF1M0 treatment could not increase sunflower yield, but the application of 50 and 100% wheat straw mulch significantly increased seed yield by10 and 18%, respectively. For both years and sites, on average the maximum seed yield was found with the RF1M100 treatment (1629 kg ha(-1)), while the minimum value (1318 kg ha(-1)) was related to RF0M0 treatment. Wheat straw mulching reduced soil temperature and increased soil water storage, organic C and microbial biomass C. We concluded that the ridge-furrow planting system with full coverage of the soil surface with wheat straw mulch could be critical in the cultivation of sunflower under arid and semiarid areas, where water is the most important factor in determining plant growth and yield.

Nutrient uptake by crops might be limited when nutrients are stratified, especially in semi-arid or Mediterranean regions. To reduce stratification, infrequent tillage could be considered. However, there is a paucity of information on the effects of long-term infrequent tillage on the stratification of soil chemical parameters. This study aimed to assess the effects of long-term infrequent tillage on the stratification of selected soil chemical parameters to a depth of 300 mm. The research was conducted on a long-term (42 years) research site at Langgewens Research Farm in South Africa. Seven tillage treatments were investigated: continuous mouldboard ploughing to a depth of 200 mm, tine-tillage to 150 mm, shallow tine-tillage to 75 mm, no-tillage, shallow tine-tillage every second year in rotation with no-tillage, shallow tine-tillage every third year in rotation with no-tillage and shallow tine-tillage every fourth year in rotation with no-tillage. Tillage treatments had differential effects on the distribution of soil chemical parameters. The mouldboard plough prevented stratification of most soil chemical parameters, such as soil acidity, soil organic carbon (SOC), extractable P, exchangeable Ca and Mg and cation exchange capacity (CEC). However, mouldboard ploughing also led to significantly lower SOC stocks and extractable P stocks. The SOC stocks and extractable P stocks of the no-tillage treatment were not significantly different from those of the infrequent tillage treatments. Overall, the infrequent tillage treatments were no better (P > 0.05) than the notillage treatment as infrequent tillage could not effectively ameliorate the stratification of most soil chemical parameters and did not increase the stocks and stratification ratios of SOC and extractable P.

The study aimed at developing drought-tolerant sorghum varieties possessing a high protein content and tolerance to grain mold with stable performance using additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) and genotype and genotype x environment interaction (GGE) biplot methods. Systematic hybridization among the 11 superior landraces resulted in subsequent pedigree-based breeding and selection from 2010 to 2015 evolved 19 promising varieties of grains such as white, yellow, and brown pericarp grains. These grain varieties were evaluated for their adaptability and stability for yield in 13 rainfed environments and for possessing tolerance to grain mold in three hot spot environments. A variety of yellow pericarp sorghum PYPS 2 (3,698 kg/ha; 14.52% protein; 10.70 mg/100 g Fe) possessing tolerance to grain mold was identified as a stable variety by using both AMMI and GGE analyses. Four mega-environments were identified for grain yield and fodder yield. Sorghum varieties PYPS 2, PYPS 4, PYPS 8, and PYPS 11 were highly stable in E2 with a low grain mold incidence. Besides meeting the nutritional demand of smallholder farmers under dryland conditions, these varieties are suitable for enhancing sorghum productivity under the present climate change scenario.																			1664-462X					JUN 30	2021	12								659874	10.3389/fpls.2021.659874	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.659874								34276722					WOS:000674068800001

Productivity under Calcareous Soils in Drylands	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS												The increase in world population especially in developing countries, where soil fertility and health are decreasing continuously, leading to soil degradation and desertification. Water scarcity in developing countries mostly under semiarid climates is one of the major problems that decrease crop growth and yield leading to food security problems. Integrated foliar nutrients management system could improve crop growth, yield and yield components of crops under arid and semiarid climates. There is lack of research to study the impact of integrated foliar nutrients management in field crops. Therefore, two field experiments were designed (2010-11 & 2012-13) with an objective to investigate the impact of integrated foliar nutrients management on wheat productivity under the semiarid condition. In experiment one, foliar spray of sole boron (B), sole zinc (Zn) and their combination (Zn + B) was applied at various growth stages (tillering, booting and anthesis) under irrigated vs. dryland wheat. It was concluded that integrated foliar application of Zn + B in one single split (0.2% each) or two equal splits (0.1% + 0.1% each) at booting stage increased yield and yield components of wheat. In experiment two, foliar macro nutrients [phosphorus (P) and potassium (K)] and micronutrients [boron (B) and zinc (Zn)] alone and in various combinations at boot and pre-anthesis stages was investigated. The results revealed that integrated use of foliar micronutrients (Zn+B) produced the highest spikes m(-2), grains spike(-1) and heavy seeds (grains). On the other hand, integrated use of foliar macro nutrients along with boron (P + K + B) produced longer spikes, more spikelets spike(-1) and higher grain yield. Earlier foliar nutrients spray at boot stage increased wheat productivity.

J	Sekiguchi, Y; Ubi, BE; Ishii, T				Sekiguchi, Yuka; Ubi, Benjamin Ewa; Ishii, Takayoshi			Chemical emasculation in cowpea (<i>Vigna unguiculata</i> (L.) Walp.) and dicotyledonous model species using trifluoromethanesulfonamide (TFMSA)	PLANT REPRODUCTION												Hybridization plays an indispensable role in creating the diversity associated with plant evolution and genetic improvement of crops. Production of hybrids requires control of pollination and avoidance of self-pollination for species that are predominantly autogamous. Hand emasculation, male sterility genes or male gametocides have been used in several plant species to induce pollen sterility. However, in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp), a self-pollinated cleistogamous dryland crop, only hand emasculation is used, but it is tedious and time-consuming. In this study, male sterility was effectively induced in cowpea and two dicotyledonous model species (Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. and Nicotiana benthamiana Domin) using trifluoromethanesulfonamide (TFMSA). Pollen viability assays using Alexander staining showed that 30 ml of 1000 mg/l TFMSA with two-time treatments of one-week interval at the early stage of the reproductive phase under field or greenhouse conditions induced 99% pollen sterility in cowpea. TFMSA treatment induced non-functional pollen in diploid A. thaliana at two-time treatment of 10 ml of 125-250 mg/l per plant and N. benthamiana at two-time treatment of 10 ml of 250-1000 mg/l per plant. TFMSA-treated cowpea plants produced hybrid seeds when used as the female parent in crosses with non-treated plants used as male parents, suggesting that TFMSA had no effect on female functionality in cowpea. The ease of TFMSA treatment and its effectiveness to induce pollen sterility in a wide range of cowpea genotypes, and in the two model plant species tested in this study, may expand the scope of techniques for rapid pollination control in self-pollinated species, with potential applications in plant breeding and plant reproduction science.

We propose a new fast-slow switching model in order to capture these processes on appropriate timescales within a conceptual modeling framework based on reaction-advection-diffusion equations. The fast system captures hydrological processes that occur on minute to hour timescales during and shortly after major rainstorms, assuming a fixed vegetation distribution. These include key feedbacks between vegetation biomass and downhill surface water transport, as well as between biomass and infiltration rate. The slow system acts between rain events, on a timescale of days to months, and evolves vegetation and soil moisture. Modeling processes at the appropriate timescales allows parameter values to be set by the actual processes they capture. This reduces the number of parameters that are chosen expressly to fit pattern characteristics, or to artificially slow down fast processes by the orders of magnitude required to align their timescales with the biomass dynamics. We explore the fast-slow switching model through numerical simulation on a one-dimensional hillslope, and find agreement with certain observations about the pattern formation phenomenon, including band spacing and upslope colonization rates. We also find that the predicted soil moisture dynamics are consistent with time series data that has been collected at a banded vegetation site. This fast-slow model framework introduces a tool for investigating the possible impact of changes to frequency and intensity of rain events in dryland ecosystems. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

J	Travers, SK; Eldridge, DJ; Val, J; Oliver, I				Travers, Samantha K.; Eldridge, David J.; Val, James; Oliver, Ian			Rabbits and livestock grazing alter the structure and composition of mid-storey plants in a wooded dryland	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Woody plants are critical for supporting wildlife and maintaining ecosystem structure and function in drylands. Grazing has the potential to alter woody plant community structure by affecting the size and survival of shrubs and saplings. We assessed the role of recent and historic grazing by livestock, and recent grazing by kangaroos and rabbits, on woody plant structure and composition. We measured the density and species occurrence of saplings and shrubs within three plant communities across 0.5 M km(2) of eastern Australia and used generalised linear mixed models to examine how grazing, soil texture and the basal area of mature trees altered the structure and composition of mid-storey woody plants. Due to co-evolution, we expected a stronger negative effect of grazing on shrub and sapling density and species occurrence by introduced herbivores than native herbivores and that shorter individuals would be more susceptible to recent grazing activity. We found that the density and occurrence of shrubs and saplings generally responded more negatively to introduced herbivores irrespective of their height. Sapling density was strongly reduced by recent rabbit and livestock grazing but increased in density at sites with greater kangaroo and historic livestock grazing. Recent livestock grazing also reduced the occurrence of sapling species. There were no strong effects of any grazing on shrub density, but rabbit grazing strongly reduced shrub species occurrence, with few strong responses among individual species. Our data provide strong evidence that recent grazing by livestock and rabbits can reduce sapling density and alter woody plant occurrence. This has the potential to induce long-term changes in ecosystem structure by limiting shrub and sapling establishment which could lead to aging and contracting woody plant populations.

J	Eisma, JA; Saksena, S; Merwade, V				Eisma, Jessica A.; Saksena, Siddharth; Merwade, Venkatesh			Assessing the Impact of Land Cover, Soil, and Climate on the Storage Potential of Dryland Sand Dams	FRONTIERS IN WATER												Sand dams, a water-harvesting structure employed by rural communities in drylands have an inconsistent record of effectiveness. While many sand dams are highly functioning, improper siting, siltation, seepage, and high rates of evaporation from shallow sand reservoirs inhibit the water storage capacity of some sand dams. This study examines large-scale drivers of sand dam storage potential through analysis of an integrated surface and subsurface flow model. Multiple simulations were run, and comparative simulation analyses consider the effect of geomorphological factors, intraseasonal rainfall variability, and future climate conditions on sand dam performance criteria. The analyses revealed that a watershed highly cultivated with low water crops actually reduces evapotranspiration below that of natural vegetation and supports higher groundwater recharge. Additionally, intraseasonal variation and volume of rainfall impact sand dam performance less than the prevailing pattern and duration of dry and rainy seasons. Sand dams constructed in watersheds with sandier soils may experience greater connectivity with the stream margins and thus provide additional groundwater recharge. Lastly, climate change may improve some conditions desirable for sand dam performance, such as extending the duration of the rainy season and reducing overall evapotranspiration. However, the interactions between the expected climate change conditions and other geomorphological factors may result in a net decline in sand dam performance. The results of this study may help identify watersheds that are likely to support a sand dam with high potential for capturing and storing water throughout the dry season.

Identity and Pathogenicity of Fungi Associated with Crown and Root Rot of Dryland Winter Wheat in Azerbaijan	PLANT DISEASE												A comprehensive survey was performed to assess fungal populations associated with crown and root rot of wheat throughout the main wheat-growing areas of Azerbaijan. Samples were taken from 76 fields; 630 fungal strains were isolated, identified, and evaluated for pathogenicity. The identification was conducted with morphological and molecular tools such as species-specific PCR and DNA sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1-alpha) loci. The fungus found in the greatest number of fields (44) was Fusarium culmorum with 192 isolates, followed by F. acuminatum. Other Fusarium spp. isolates were identified: F. equiseti, F. pseudograminearum, F. graminearum, F. incarnatum, F. avenaceum, F. hostae, F. oxysporum, F. proliferatum, F. algeriense, and F. brachygibbosum. Bipolaris sorokiniana, Curvularia spicifera, Exserohilum pedicellatum, Nigrospora oryzae, and Rhizoctonia spp. isolates were also identified, associated with underground parts of wheat. Phylogenetic analyses based on ITS and EF1-a sequences of the isolates showed that the isolates belonging to the same species were clearly separated in the dendrogram. Pathogenicity assays revealed that F. culmorum, F. pseudograminearum, and F. graminearum were most aggressive; F. avenaceum, F. hostae, F. algeriense, B. sorokiniana, C. spicifera, and R. solani isolates were moderately aggressive; C. inaequalis, E. pedicellatum, and N. oryzae were weakly aggressive; and others were nonpathogenic. The result of this study exhibited the existence of a wide range of species associated with crown and root rot of wheat in Azerbaijan. Additionally, this is the first report of F. hostae, F. algeriense, C. spicifera, C. inaequalis, and N. oryzae as pathogens on wheat in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan is the second country after Algeria in which F. algeriense was detected.

The objective of this study is to determine the life cycle energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of several 2- and 3-year crop rotations with cereals and oilseeds in a low precipitation environment of the inland Pacific Northwest. The purpose is to ascertain whether cropping intensification could improve energy efficiency and reduce GHG emissions. Methods A life cycle assessment (LCA) was carried out to evaluate the fossil energy and carbon footprint of nine cropping systems characterized by different inputs applied to spring carinata [Brassica carinata (A.) Braun] and winter canola (B. napus L.) in rotation with wheat (Triticum aevistum L.) and other cereal crops. Grain yield and field activity data from cropping systems were acquired from a field experiment over a 5-year period. Gas emissions were measured weekly over 2years using static chamber methodology and laboratory gas chromatography. Inputs for the LCA regarding fertilizers, machinery fuel use, and pesticides were from the field trials and literature for fuel use. Results and discussion Emission results of winter wheat (WW) rotations are between 300 and 400g CO2 eq. kg(-1) WW, in the range for US average WW cropping emissions (i.e., 300-600g CO2 eq. kg(-1) WW). Reduced tillage fallow (RTF)-Winter oilseed (WO)-RTF-WW and summer fallow (SF)-WW rotation were the most promising, from a trade-off of GHG emissions versus total crop sales over 6years per hectare with low emissions and high sales. The best oilseed result was 660g CO2 eq. kg(-1) for canola following RTF. Highest yields were observed when cereal or oilseed crops were planted following RTF. Efficiency in terms of Energy Return on Energy Investment was 3.85 for winter oilseed yields 1338.9kg ha(-1) and 1.6 for spring oilseed yields 552.2kg ha(-1). Conclusions Compared to SF-WW, bioenergy oilseed cultivation may increase CO2 equivalent emissions in 3-year cereal-based rotations due to increased inputs with inclusion of fallow-substitution cultivation. Fossil energy inputs required to produce oilseed crops were smaller than the total energy in final seed and thus oilseeds have the potential to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Improving energy efficiency and encouraging adoption by growers will depend on ability to enhance agronomic performance with higher yielding, drought and cold tolerant oilseed varieties.

Facilitation effects on forage grasses are potentially important in improving grazing capacity on rangelands. However, the morphology-dependent performance of benefactor plants in facilitating forage species growth and supplementation under moderate grazing intensity remains unclear. Here, our main purpose was to measure facilitation performance in terms of the survival of a native forage grass, Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn. (Gramineae)., in accordance with the growth conditions of a sand-fixing benefactor shrub, Caragana microphylla Lam., in the Hulun Buir Grassland, northern China. Six study sites with patches of A. cristatum and C. microphylla were established at the foot of fixed sand dunes. At each site, five quadrats were set in places where C. microphylla coverage was 100% and A. cristatum grew among the shrubs (shrub quadrats), and another five were set where A. cristatum grew alone without C. microphylla (grass quadrats). We measured the morphological traits of C. microphylla and A. cristatum in all 60 quadrats, along with the soil water content and soil temperature. The data were compared between the shrub and grass quadrats by generalized linear mixed-effect models to assess the shrub's facilitation effects. We also used such models to elucidate the relationship between the average height of C. microphylla and the morphological traits of A. cristatum in the shrub quadrats. The maximum height, average grazed height, and the number of seed heads of A. cristatum were greater in the shrub quadrats than in the grass quadrats. The soil surface temperature was lower in the shrub quadrats. The maximum height and seed head number of A. cristatum were positively associated with the average height of C. microphylla. These results suggest that the grazing impact and heat stress were smaller in shrub quadrats than in grass quadrats, and that the degree of this protective effect depended on the shrub height. The shrub canopy seemed to reduce the increase in soil temperature and keep the grass vigorous. Livestock likely avoided grazing grasses in the C. microphylla patches because of the shrub's spiny leaves; only the upper parts of the grass stems (including the seed heads) protruding from the shrub canopy were grazed. The sand-fixing shrub thus moderates the grazing impact and soil temperature, and contributes to vegetation restoration and grazing system sustainability.

However, there has been minimal assessment to understand differential species success, compositional trends, and the aboveground carbon sequestration potential of these developing forests. We coupled quantitative planting information of >50 native woody tree and shrub species with surveys of 5,223 stems of 4,606 individuals in a chronosequence of restored forests ranging in age from 1 to 33 years to estimate species-specific mortality rates, biomass accumulation and recruitment, as well as compositional trends in the herbaceous understory. We show that 7-15 years are required for mortality rates of the transplanted cohort to stabilize to background levels observed in other dry forests. A small number of species, mostly N-fixing trees with a deep rooting habit, persisted on the landscape beyond 15 years. Even so, aboveground biomass (corrected for differences in initial planting density) accumulated at an average rate of 1.41 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) compared to 0.35 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for a fallow old-field. Species biomass growth rates increased with decreasing mortality, as did the abundance of recruits, suggesting a degree of reproduction by initial planted cohorts. However, a suite of highly competitive exotic grasses increases in density over a 25-year period, which we link to suppressed seedling recruitment. This poses a serious challenge to the long-term sustainability of planted forests in the LRGV. We highlight potential avenues of research and modification to restoration methodologies.																			1061-2971	1526-100X				APR	2022	30	4							e13559	10.1111/rec.13559	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.13559		JAN 2022											WOS:000737410400001

Timing and duration of precipitation pulses and interpulses influence seedling recruitment in the Great Basin	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Precipitation pulses and interpulse dry periods are major drivers of dryland ecosystem function globally, yet how the patterning and timing of precipitation inputs and dry periods influence seedling recruitment in these systems is poorly understood. We conducted two experiments to understand how limited and variable patterns of precipitation inputs may influence recruitment of bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata [Pursh] A. Love). In the first experiment, we evaluated how precipitation magnitude and dry-d interval during spring influenced recruitment. Ambient precipitation was excluded during spring, and we experimentally applied 5 levels of water (25, 35, 45, 55, and 65 mm) and 5-dry-d durations (1, 2, 4, 6, or 8 dry d between waterings) to plots sown with P. spicata. In the second experiment, we evaluated how the seasonal timing and duration of dry d influenced recruitment. All ambient precipitation was excluded through late winter and spring, and we experimentally applied three levels of dry-d duration (10, 20, and 30 d) four times during the growing season (February, March, April, and May) to plots sown with P. spicata. We observed strong, nonlinear interactive effects of precipitation amount and dry-d interval on recruitment where the midpoint dry-d treatment (4 d) interacted with low water availability to drive a major decline in recruitment. We also found strong evidence that recruitment was limited by dry periods occurring in late winter as opposed to dry periods occurring through spring, with recruitment decreasing over 40% during February dry periods compared with dry periods in March, April, or May. By understanding how precipitation pulses and interpulse dry periods interact to drive recruitment, we can refine efforts to develop weather-centric restoration frameworks, as well as hone ongoing efforts to identify plant materials and seed enhancement technologies that may buffer effects of variable precipitation on recruitment.

Primary production responses to extreme changes in North American Monsoon precipitation vary by elevation and plant functional composition through time	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Primary production in dryland ecosystems is limited by water availability and projected to be strongly affected by future shifts in seasonal precipitation. Warm-season precipitation derived from the North American Monsoon contributes 40% of annual precipitation to dryland ecosystems in the southwestern United States and is projected to become more variable. However, there is large uncertainty on whether this variability will be expressed as either extreme wet or dry years and how primary production of different plant functional types will respond across widespread elevation gradients in this region. We experimentally imposed extreme drought and water addition treatments from 2016 to 2020, during which ambient warm-season precipitation declined to reach historic lows, to understand production sensitivity of dominant plant functional types along a 1000 m elevation gradient. We found that the production responses of plant functional types to monsoon precipitation extremes were dependent on the number of treatment years that occurred across sites along the elevation gradient. C-4 perennial grasses were most responsive to precipitation manipulation treatments, followed by C-3 perennial grasses and annuals, while perennial forbs and shrubs had weak or no responses. C-4 perennial grass reductions due to extreme drought were generally stronger or occurred earlier at low elevation sites, while multi-year extreme drought extended negative effects to C-3 perennial grasses at high elevation, and all sites showed delayed responses to multi-year water addition. We found that the sensitivity of C-3 perennial grass production differed for extreme drought and water addition compared to ambient precipitation at one site, but other sites and plant functional types had similar sensitivities to the different treatment types. Synthesis. The upward advance of primary production responsiveness from single- to multi-year extreme changes in warm-season precipitation suggests more immediate shifts in functional composition and carbon cycling at low elevation, while high elevation ecosystems may become less resistant as the effects of extreme precipitation compound through time.

We classified occurrence records data into six historical groups (from 1960 to 2018) and a contemporary group (from 2019 to 2022). We investigated the ability of historical data to generate accurate predictions of the species' contemporary distribution. We used species distribution modelling to compute habitat suitability values and identified spatial clusters of high suitability values (using hotspot analyses).Results: We show that historical occurrences successfully predicted the contemporary distribution of A. microscaphus. We demonstrate that the geographical distribution of contemporary hotspots is strongly related to precipitation of the wettest quarter. This research provides evidence that climate change will likely affect the distribution of hotspots and the habitat suitability of A. microscaphus. Losses of 37%-48% contraction are expected at the margins of the range both in the north and south of the geographic limits.Main Conclusions: We show that recent past data can be used to predict contemporary species distribution accurately. We highlight that habitat suitability values of A. microscaphus are strongly related to climate, topography and distance to streams. This study provides clear evidence of the negative impacts of climate change on habitat suitability in the Southwest United States drylands. Our approach has applied utility to managers to target survey areas, monitor habitat changes, plan for conservation mitigation measures, conserve stream flows across the species' range and inform recovery if needed. Thus, managers could use previously collected data to predict contemporary species distribution when their occurrence accurately characterizes the species' ecological niche.

Performance of medicinal crops in mango (<i>Mangifera indica</i>) based intercropping system under dryland conditions of Jammu subtropics	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES												Mango (Mangifera indica L.) based agroforestry system offers spatial advantage for intercropping in Indian subtropics. Mango is planted at wide spacing to accommodate the large crowns needed to support the fruit yield. Wider spacing of the trees provides the vacant space to the orchardist to grow suitable and synergistic crop (vegetables/medicinal plants) to supplement his income. The present investigation was done to screen out the best intercrop out of the four crops, viz. ginger, turmeric, kalmegh and stevia that can be grown in old mango orchards. The experiment was laid out at Experimental Farm of Advance Centre for Horticulture Research (ACHR), Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology, Udheywala, Jammu, which is located at an altitude of 327m above mean sea level, between 32 degrees 73' N latitude and 74 degrees 87' E longitude. Mango orchard selected for the study had a very dense canopy and thus the interception of light was only 30-40 percent than that in the open. The results revealed that shade had profound influence on the survival, growth and yield of ginger, turmeric, stevia and kalmegh. The higher values for plant height, number of leaves, were recorded in ginger and turmeric under shade compared to stevia and kalmegh. Stevia had a very poor survival percentage (11.99%) under mango as compared to open. Likewise ginger had a poor survival percentage (13.22%) in the open compared to that under the mango canopy. Thus, it was concluded that under the subtropical conditions of Jammu region, ginger, turmeric and kalmegh can be grown successfully as intercrops under partial shade of mango trees, however, stevia cannot be integrated. The most remunerative crop among the four, in terms of yield was turmeric followed by ginger and kalmegh.																			0019-5022	2394-3319				DEC	2020	90	12					2385	2390																WOS:000617643500021

Implications for dryland precision restoration	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Drylands functioning depends on water fluxes and the retention of resources. The restoration of degraded areas should mimic the natural arrangement of vegetation in the landscape in a source-sink pattern. Reintroducing key woody seedlings through planting is a major concern in ecological restoration as these areas often exceed degradation thresholds and ecosystem functions are limited. However, it is not clear how natural fluxes might determine seedlings performance of key woody species. We have analyzed the microcatchment surface area of planting spots with and without water optimization treatment (waterproof surfaces with dry wells) and the survival and growth of Olea europaea seedlings during six years after planting in a semiarid degraded landscape. We recorded a positive effect of water optimization treatment in seedling survival and growth highlighting water limitation of these sites. We did not observe a clear and linear relationship between microcatchment collecting surface area and plant performance. The higher the collecting surface the lower the retention capacity of the planting pitch suggesting a loss of the integrity of the planting hole structure. Water optimization treatments were especially effective when collecting surface areas were low. These results might be useful for designing precision restoration actions in degraded landscapes.

Drought frequently occurs in the Indian state of Rajasthan, and so far, very little attention has been paid towards its vulnerability assessment. Therefore, the present study focuses on a spatial multi-criteria integrated technique for an all-out drought vulnerability assessment and mapping consisting of geographic information systems (GIS) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) techniques. The data have been acquired from various secondary sources pertaining to a total of 16 indicators under meteorological (rainfall, temperature and evapotranspiration), hydrological (hydrogeology, elevation, groundwater level, groundwater development and surface water bodies), agricultural (available water holding capacity of soils, land use and slope) and socio-economic (density of population, female-to-male ratio, irrigated land, agriculture-dependent population and deep tube wells) drought categories. Further, spatial layers for each category have been developed by various GIS operations followed by the calculation of weights for each drought category and type employing pair-wise comparison matrices by means of AHP criterion. Afterwards, individual drought category and comprehensive drought vulnerability maps have been prepared by employing the weighted overlay technique. The generated maps have effectively displayed the areal spreads and levels of drought vulnerability with respect to normal, mild, moderate, severe and extreme category of droughts. The findings from this study have demonstrated a proneness of severe to extreme drought vulnerability in 25% area of the state. Distinctively, the eastern, western, central and small pockets of south-western parts of the state have witnessed severe to extreme drought vulnerability, while the remaining areas have demonstrated normal to moderate drought vulnerability. The results of the overall drought vulnerability have been validated by employing normalized difference vegetation index and past occurrence of drought disasters, which revealed an accuracy of 81%. The obtained results prove the effectiveness of geoinformatics and AHP techniques in comprehensive drought vulnerability assessment and mapping. Finally, the findings of the present study may be easily applied for designing suitable drought mitigation strategies of the vulnerable areas.

Many researchers have studied the effect of reclaimed water on soil environment, crop yield, etc. However, carbon sequestration in reclaimed water irrigated agricultural systems is less studied. This study investigates methane uptake and photosynthesis in reclaimed water irrigation systems contributing to carbon sequestration estimation and analyzes the important factors impacting them. The results show that CH4 uptake is related to soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) with a quadratic and it has the highest uptake when WFPS is between 40 and 50%. Long-term reclaimed water irrigation could significantly decrease (p < 0.05) CH4 uptake and macroaggregate stability in the topsoil. However, reclaimed water had no significant impact on photosynthesis in comparison. The type of fertilizer is an important factor which impacts CH4 emission from soil; urea had a lower CH4 uptake and a higher CO2 emission than slow-released fertilizer. Overall, reclaimed water irrigation could effectively decrease soil carbon sequestration. A soil wetted proportion level of 40-50% was recommended in this study for favorable methane oxidation. Slow-released fertilizer in reclaimed water irrigated agriculture could better control soil carbon emission and soil carbon absorption.

Short-term geomorphological and riparian vegetation responses to a 40-year flood on a braided, dryland river	ECOHYDROLOGY												In December 2010, a 40-year flood occurred in the lower Virgin River (SE Nevada, southwestern United States), a braided river segment with riparian vegetation largely dominated by invasive shrubs in the genus Tamarix. We assessed geomorphological and vegetation responses to this large magnitude disturbance event by comparing pre- and post-flood remote sensing and field survey data in four river reaches. Analyses of orthophotos and light detection and ranging-derived topography showed that both the active channel area and channel width increased between 80% and 258%, representing an increase from 13% to 30% of the total river corridor area. Erosion predominated in the outer bends of the enlarged channel and deposition in the pre-flood channel, causing local avulsions of the low-flow channel. Field-based topographic data recorded before and after the flood in 385 plots also showed that deposition occurred in parts of the floodplain that were not eroded. Two thirds of woody vegetation cover (mainly dominated by Tamarix, with some native shrub Pluchea sericea) was lost in areas that eroded (similar to 20% of the river corridor). In the remaining similar to 80% of stable river corridor (aggrading or no change in elevation) Tamarix remained dominant. Following erosion, but also where sediment deposition predominated under the Tamarix canopy, the most common colonizing vegetation in the understory was comprised of annual plants, especially Salsola tragus. Our study supported previous studies describing large floods in braided rivers; we documented the first phase of a cycle of channel widening and increase in vegetation heterogeneity that is commonly followed by narrowing and vegetation homogenization.

The effect of supplemental irrigation from polyacrylamide-treated microcatchments on the growth of <i>acacia saligna</i> in dryland	FOREST SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												A field study was carried to determine the impact of the land application of polyacrylamide (PAM) on the runoff used for supplemental irrigation. Five treatments were investigated: PAM A-130, PAM A-836, PAM Aerotil, plastic mulch, and natural (no PAM no mulch). Runoff was collected in barrels placed at the downstream end of fifteen plots and then used for the irrigation of acacia trees planted in an experimental site in Jordan. The growth characteristics of the acacia were monitored over a two-year period from 2009 to 2010. The total runoff volumes were significantly different over PAM A-836, PAM Aerotil, and plastic mulch compared to the natural. The results showed that supplemental irrigation of acacia with water collected from PAM plots significantly increased the acacia height and number of leaves compared to the natural and rainfed treatments. The use of PAM-treated runoff also slightly increased the number of branches of the acacia, but the increase was only significant in the case of PAM A-836. There was a weak correlation between the volume of supplemental irrigation generated and the morphological characteristics. The type of PAM seems to have improved plant growth irrespective of the volume of runoff collected.

Foraging strategies of individual silky pocket mice over a boom-bust cycle in a stochastic dryland ecosystem	OECOLOGIA												Small mammals use multiple foraging strategies to compensate for fluctuating resource quality in stochastic environments. These strategies may lead to increased dietary overlap when competition for resources is strong. To quantify temporal contributions of high (C-3) versus low quality (C-4) resources in diets of silky pocket mice (Perognathus flavus), we used stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) analysis of 1391 plasma samples collected over 2years. Of these, 695 samples were from 170 individuals sampled >= 3 times across seasons or years, allowing us to assess changes in dietary breadth at the population and individual levels across a boom-bust population cycle. In 2014, the P. flavus population increased to 412 captures compared to 8 captures in prior and subsequent years, while populations of co-occurring small mammals remained stable. As intraspecific competition increased, the population-wide dietary niche of P. flavus did not change, but individual specialization increased significantly. During this period, similar to 27% (41/151) of individuals sampled specialized on C-3 resources, which were abundant during the spring and previous fall seasons. Most of the remaining individuals were C-3-C-4 generalists (64%) (96/151), and only 9% (14/151) specialized on C-4 resources. In 2015, P. flavus population density and resource availability declined, individual dietary breadth expanded (84% generalists), no C-3 specialists were found, and specialization on C-4 resources increased (16%). Our results demonstrate a high degree of inter-individual plasticity in P. flavus foraging strategies, which has implications for how this species will respond to environmental change that is predicted to decrease C-3 resources in the future.

In this study, live and dead carbon stocks aboveground, belowground, and in the soil to a 30 cm depth, as well as tree and shrub species diversity, were measured in a tropical lowland dry forest, 23 years after a fire in 1998, for comparison with adjacent unburned reference forests. The results showed that 23 years since the fire was insufficient, in this case, to recover live forest carbon and plant species diversity, to the level of the reference forests. The total carbon stock, in the recovering 23-year-old forest, was 199 Mg C ha(-1) or about 90% of the unburned forest (220 Mg C ha(-1)), mainly due to the contribution of coarse woody debris and an increase in the 5-10 cm soil horizon's organic carbon, in the burned forest. The carbon held in the live biomass of the recovering forest (79 Mg C ha(-1)) was just over half the 146 Mg C ha(-1) of the reference forest. Based on a biomass mean annual increment of 6.24 +/- 1.59 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), about 46 +/- 17 years would be required for the aboveground live biomass to recover to equivalence with the reference forest. In total, 176 plant species were recorded in the 23-year post-fire forest, compared with 216 in the unburned reference forest. The pioneer species Macaranga gigantea dominated in the 23-year post-fire forest, which was yet to regain the similar stand structural and compositional elements as those found in the adjacent unburned reference forest.

The design used was a completely randomized design (CRD). The applied treatments consisted of four levels of hydrogel: without hydrogel (control), 2, 4, and 6 g per plant, respectively. Each treatment was repeated six times in this experiment, yielding a total of 24 experimental pots. Each experiment pot contained 3 plants, thus all 72 plants. The results showed that the hydrogel would significantly increase soil moisture, relative water content, growth of the plant height, stem diameter, and ear cobs without corn husk. Likewise, on the length of the ear without ear cobs and wet ear weights without corn husk. As the hydrogel preserves soil moisture, allowing water to be available for the plant, it might also temporarily store soil from the water and gradually remove it into the soil. Further investigations should be performed to completely characterize the interaction between the superabsorbent hydrogel and the dry land soil.

Rainfall interception by mountain big sagebrush (<i>Artemisia tridentata</i> spp. <i>vaseyana</i>): Dryland shrub canopy cover affects net precipitation	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Canopy interception loss is an important component of the water budget for many ecosystems, and may be particularly influential in semi-arid shrublands where water is limiting. In this experiment, we quantified interception loss by mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata spp. vaseyana) using simulated rainfall events in the field. Various levels of canopy cover and rainfall intensities were tested to measure their effects on net precipitation and interception loss. Additionally, the comparisons were made between three methods of measuring shrub cover to enhance the scalability of results. Stands of sagebrush from 20% to 50% canopy cover intercepted 18.5 +/- 12.5% of incoming precipitation. Percent interception loss differed by 13.7% between the high and low cover classes, indicating that net precipitation may be significantly reduced under mature, dense stands of sagebrush. Hemispherical photography was a viable method for estimating canopy cover in this vegetation type. Interception loss by sagebrush was 14% lower on average than pinyon and juniper measured in the same watershed. Results from this study quantified the effects of sagebrush canopy on rainfall interception and improved understanding of vegetation dynamics in the sagebrush steppe.

In southern Africa, coastal locations have been viewed as key places for the development of human resource use and behaviour, with the dryness of the continental interior after c.130 ka regarded as both an obstacle to occupation and a limit on behaviour. Newly excavated MSA sites on the floor of the now-dry palaeolake Makgadikgadi basin, central Botswana, along with accompanying environmental data, have provided a significant opportunity to reassess the nature of MSA adaptation to, and behaviour under, dry conditions. Excavated sites dated to 80-72 ka and post 57 ka reveal purposeful early human use of an extensive 60,000 km2 lacustrine basin during dry, as opposed to lake-high, phases, as well as highlighting movement strategies for tool-making resource procurement. Findings have significant implications for theories of early human mobility and innovation, as well as for understanding the drivers, constraints and opportunities for the use of drylands. The deliberate selective movement of lithic raw materials within the basin for artefact manufacture evidences thoughtful adaptation to dry conditions within the lake basin.

Assessing the grain nutrient variability in genebank collections can identify potential sources for biofortification. This study aimed to assess the genetic variability for grain nutrients in a set of 600 pigeonpea germplasms conserved at the RS Paroda Genebank, ICRISAT, India. The field trials conducted during the 2019 and 2020 rainy seasons in augmented design with four checks revealed significant differences among genotypes for all the agronomic traits and grain nutrients studied. The germplasm had a wider variation for agronomic traits like days to 50% flowering (67-166 days), days to maturity (112-213 days), 100-seed weight (1.69-22.17 g), and grain yield per plant (16.54-57.93 g). A good variability was observed for grain nutrients, namely, protein (23.35-29.50%), P (0.36-0.50%), K (1.43-1.63%), Ca (1,042.36-2,099.76 mg/kg), Mg (1,311.01-1,865.65 mg/kg), Fe (29.23-40.98 mg/kg), Zn (24.14-35.68 mg/kg), Mn (8.56-14.01 mg/kg), and Cu (7.72-14.20 mg/kg). The germplasm from the Asian region varied widely for grain nutrients, and the ones from African region had high nutrient density. The significant genotype x environment interaction for most of the grain nutrients (except for P, K, and Ca) indicated the sensitivity of nutrient accumulation to the environment. Days to 50% flowering and days to maturity had significant negative correlation with most of the grain nutrients, while grain yield per plant had significant positive correlation with protein and magnesium, which can benefit simultaneous improvement of agronomic traits with grain nutrients. Clustering of germplasms based on Ward.D2 clustering algorithm revealed the co-clustering of germplasm from different regions. The identified top 10 nutrient-specific and 15 multi-nutrient dense landraces can serve as promising sources for the development of biofortified lines in a superior agronomic background with a broad genetic base to fit the drylands. Furthermore, the large phenotypic data generated in this study can serve as a raw material for conducting SNP/haplotype-based GWAS to identify genetic variants that can accelerate genetic gains in grain nutrient improvement.

It is of great significance to study the relationship between forest growth and climate in this region under the background of global change. At present, relevant research mostly focuses on the Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr.), and little is known about how Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia Kom.) responds to climate change. To investigate the potential relationships between radial growth of P. crassifolia and climatic conditions in Ningxia, China, we collected tree-ring samples from P. crassifolia growing in the HL and LS and then established the standard tree-ring width chronologies for the two sites. Correlation analysis together with multivariate linear regression and relative contribution analyses were used, and results showed that radial growth in the HL was determined by the precipitation in the previous September, by the standardized evapotranspiration index (SPEI) in the current March and June, and by the maximum air temperature in the current September. The maximum air temperature in the current September contributed the most (0.348) to the radial growth in the HL. In the LS, radial growth was determined by the precipitation in the previous September and in the current March and by the minimum air temperature in the current July. The factor that made the most contribution was the precipitation in the current March (0.489). Our results suggested that in the wetting and warming future, growth of P. crassifolia in the HL will increase while that in the LS needs further investigation. Our results also provide a basis for predicting how P. crassifolia in northwest China will grow under the background of future climate change and provide a reference for formulating relevant management measures to achieve ecological protection and sustainable development policies.					huang, jian/JMR-4475-2023; Zhu, Liangjun/GXG-2390-2022	Zhu, Liangjun/0000-0003-0111-1450; chen, lin/0000-0003-2015-1415														1999-4907				OCT	2021	12	10							1382	10.3390/f12101382	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f12101382													WOS:000717018400001

Previous studies report that anammox bacteria are distributed in a wide range of habitats and plays significant roles in the global nitrogen cycle. However, most studies focus only on individual ecosystems or datasets from public databases. To date, our understanding of how anammox bacteria respond to environmental properties and are distributed in different habitats on a global scale, remain unclear. To explore the global distribution of anammox bacteria, samples were collected from different habitats at different locations globally, including wetlands, drylands, groundwater aquifers and snow from 10 countries across six continents. We then used high-throughput amplicon sequencing targeting the functional gene hydrazine synthase (HZS) and generated community profiles. Results showed that Candidatus Brocadia is detected as the dominant genus on a global scale, accounting for 80.0% to 99.9% of the retrieved sequences in different habitats. The Jettenia-like sequences were the second most abundant group, accounting for no more than 19.9% of the retrieved sequences in all sites. The samples in drylands, wetlands and groundwater aquifers showed similar community composition and diversity, with the snow samples being the most different. Deterministic processes seem stronger in regulating the community composition of anammox bacteria, which is supported by the higher proportion explained by local-scale factors. Groundwater aquifers showed high gene abundance and the most complex co-occurrence network among the four habitat types, suggesting that it might be the preferred habitat of anammox bacteria. There is little competition between anammox bacterial species based on co-occurrence analysis. Hence, we could infer that environmental factors such as anaerobic and stable conditions, instead of substrate limitations, may be vital factors determining the anammox bacteria community. These results provide a better understanding of the global distribution of anammox bacteria and the ecological factors that affect their community structuring in diverse habitats.					yang, qing/JBR-8440-2023; Wang, Xiaogang/B-2439-2013; Ye, Fei/JRW-7553-2023	Wang, Xiaogang/0000-0002-7929-5889; Zhu, Guibing/0000-0001-7227-8157													1664-302X					NOV 12	2019	10								2583	10.3389/fmicb.2019.02583	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.02583								31798550					WOS:000501210400001

However, little research attention has been paid to studying the combined effects of PSB and P fertilizer on improving P uptake and yield of rainfed wheat plant under natural conditions in arid and semi-arid regions including drylands. Field experiments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with a 3 x 4 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments with three replications during years 2017-2018 (Y1) and 2018-2019 (Y2) (at four fields) at two various locations (Qazvin and Zanjan). Experimental treatments included P fertilizer factor at three levels: no fertilizer (P0), triple superphosphate (TSP) fertilizer at 10 kg P ha(-1) (P10), and TSP fertilizer at 20 kg P ha(-1) (P20) and four variants of PSB factor: no inoculation (B0), inoculation with Pseudomonas baetica B21 (B1), inoculation with Pseudomonas helmanticensis B30 (B2), and co-inoculation with B21 and B30 (B3). The results of this study showed that the growth indices and P nutrition of rainfed wheat in dryland fields were affected by the time and location of planting. The application of 20 kg P ha(-1 )and single inoculation and coinoculation of wheat with bacterial strains had a significant (p <= 0.05) impact on reduced electrolyte leakage. However, the application of 20 kg P ha(-1) and single inoculation and co-inoculation of wheat with strains B21 and B30 showed a significant (p <= 0.05) effect on increased relative water content, chlorophyll index, proline content, plant height, shoot dry weight, thousand grain weight, and the concentration of shoot and gain P. As a result, application of 20 kg P ha(-1) and single inoculation and coinoculation of wheat with strains B21 and B30 increased gain yield by 63, 43, 52, and 58%, respectively. However, the pattern of these fluctuations differed in different years and locations. The significant enhancement of biomass parameters and grain yield of rainfed wheat by co-inoculation of PSB in combination with 20 kg P ha(-1) strongly supports the use of Pseudomonas strains as a biofertilizer for improving the wheat growth and grain yield in rainfed farming systems. The results of this study also highlight the importance of simultaneous introduction of phosphate fertilizer and PSB for improving plant performance under drought stress.

Foliar fungicide applications and currently available seed treatments do not control FCR. Alternative crops that provide a rotational benefit to reduce disease are not economically feasible. Major-gene resistance is unavailable, but there is preliminary evidence that some wheat and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivars are more resistant than others. We followed up on preliminary work by growing 14 varieties of winter wheat, planted with in-furrow FCR inoculum, in 2018 and 2019 in Morrow County, Oregon-one of the world's driest wheat producing regions. Two barley cultivars were added to the experiment during the second year of research. Evaluations of cultivar resistance were made by conducting aboveground visual assessments by counting whiteheads, prematurely senesced wheat heads that are indicative of FCR infection. Whitehead count information was correlated with yield and grain volume weight data. Maximum whitehead counts were measured in plots of the FCR-susceptible check cultivar 'Stephens'. There was no evidence of a cultivar-specific relationship between whitehead count and corresponding values for yield and grain volume weight. There was limited evidence that some cultivars have the capacity to compensate for effects of disease.

Untangling the complex mix of agronomic and economic uncertainties inherent in decisions on rainfed cotton	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE												Context. Production of rainfed (dryland) cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) occurs in many places globally, and is always burdened with greater uncertainties in outcomes than irrigated cotton. Assessing farm financial viability helps farmers to make clearer and more informed decisions with a fuller awareness of the potential risks to their business. Aim. We aimed to highlight key points of uncertainty common in rainfed cotton production and quantify these variable conditions to facilitate clearer decision-making on sowing dates and row configurations. Methods. The consequences of these decisions at six locations across two states in Australia, given estimates of plant-available water at sowing, are expressed in terms of comparable probability distributions of cotton lint yield (derived from crop modelling using historical weather data) and gross margin per hectare (derived from historical prices for inputs and cotton lint yield), using the copula approach. Examples of contrasting conditions and likely outcomes are summarised. Key results. Sowing at the end of October with solid row configuration tended to provide the highest yield; however, single- and double-skip row configurations generally resulted in higher gross margins. Places associated with higher summer-dominant rainfall had greater chance of positive gross margins. Conclusion. In order to maximise the probability of growing a profitable crop, farmers need to consider the variabilities and dependencies within and across price and yield before selecting the most appropriate agronomic decisions. Implications. Given appropriate data on growing conditions and responses, our methodology can be applied in other locations around the world, and to other crops.

We aimed to understand which abiotic and spatial variables influence ant beta -diversity and identify which processes may drive ant beta -diversity patterns in Mediterranean drylands by measuring the percentage of variation in ant taxonomic and functional beta -diversity explained by local environmental, regional climatic and spatial variables. We found that taxonomic and functional replacement (beta (repl)) primarily drove patterns in overall beta -diversity (beta (tot)). Variation partitioning analysis showed that respectively 16.8%, 12.9% and 21.6% of taxonomic beta (tot), beta (repl) and beta (rich) variation were mainly explained by local environmental variables. Local environmental variables were also the main determinants of functional beta -diversity, explaining 20.4%, 17.9% and 23.2% of beta (tot), beta (repl) and beta (rich) variation, respectively. Findings suggest that niche-based processes drive changes in ant beta -diversity, as local environmental variables may act as environmental filters on species and trait composition. While we found that local environmental variables were important predictors of ant beta -diversity, further analysis should address the contribution of other mechanisms, e.g. competitive exclusion and resource partitioning, on ant beta -diversity.

Detecting Woody Plants in Southern Arizona Using Data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)	REMOTE SENSING												Land cover changes and conversions are occurring rapidly in response to human activities throughout the world. Woody plant encroachment (WPE) is a type of land cover conversion that involves the proliferation and/or densification of woody plants in an ecosystem. WPE is especially prevalent in drylands, where subtle changes in precipitation and disturbance regimes can have dramatic effects on vegetation structure and degrade ecosystem functions and services. Accurately determining the distribution of woody plants in drylands is critical for protecting human and natural resources through woody plant management strategies. Using an object-based approach, we have used novel open-source remote sensing and in situ data from Santa Rita Experimental Range (SRER), National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), Arizona, USA with machine learning algorithms and tested each model's efficacy for estimating fractional woody cover (FWC) to quantify woody plant extent. Model performance was compared using standard model assessment metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and runtime to assess model variables and hyperparameters. We found that decision tree-based models with a binary classification scheme performed best, with sequential models (Boosting) slightly outperforming independent models (Random Forest) for both object classification and FWC estimates. Mean canopy height and mean, median, and maximum statistics for all vegetation indices were found to have highest variable importance. Optimal model hyperparameters and potential limitations of the NEON dataset for classifying woody plants in dryland regions were also identified. Overall, this study lays the groundwork for developing machine learning models for dryland woody plant management using solely NEON data.

In this study, seven cultivars of grain sorghums ('301/41,' '304/5,' '319/8,' '319/22,' '341/10,' '341/120,' and '366/58') which developed in the drylands of Texas-US were evaluated in the Mid-Atlantic, a relatively wet region. The objective of the study was to evaluate crop response to phosphorus, productivity in the Mid-Atlantic, and its potential for bioethanol production. Seed yield, starch, and element content, stover biomass, forage quality, and whole-plant bioethanol yield were determined. Phosphorus had no effect, and only cultivars were compared. Cultivar showed differences in seed and stover yield, seed quality attributes, and potential bioethanol yield. Cultivar '366/58' produced the greatest seed yield averaged at 4934 kg ha (-1) yr (-1) while '301/41' and '341/10' produced the least averaged at 2,743 and 2,968 kg ha (-1), respectively, Stover yield across years ranged from 6,798 to 13,365 kg ha (-1), and the whole plant estimated bioethanol ranged from 3,159 to 5,770 L ha (-1). The stover had appreciable forage quality, including a 49 g kg (-1) crude protein, sufficient for animal maintenance needs. Up to 96 kg N ha (-1) and 211 kg K ha (-1) were removed from harvested stover, an issue of concern for crop fertilizer management strategy and sustained production.																			0010-3624	1532-2416				APR 12	2022	53	7					892	901		10.1080/00103624.2022.2034845	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2022.2034845		FEB 2022											WOS:000749476600001

Understanding the relationships between the crop yield, nitrogen requirement, and nitrate residue level under the combined N and P fertilizer application is necessary to optimize the fertilizer recommendation method in order to reduce the nitrate residue levels. In 2009, we established a long-term field fertilization experiment with five N application rates and four P application rates in the winter wheat-summer maize double cropping system. The grain yield, N requirement, and soil nitrate residue were determined during 2016-2019 to optimize the N inputs for nitrate residue control. The crop yield was increased by N application and it increased further when combined with P fertilizer. The N requirement of crops increased by N application but decreased when combined with P. The calculated maximum winter wheat yield was 7235 kg ha- 1 and the theoretical N requirement for 1000 kg grain formation (NR) was 28.68 kg Mg-1. The maximum summer maize yield was 7866 kg ha- 1, and the theoretical NR was determined as 23.43 kg Mg- 1. The residual nitrate-N was increased by N application but decreased by combined P fertilizer. The correlation between the nitrate-N content in 0-20 cm top soil (SNC) and nitrate-N residue in 0-100 cm soil (SNR) was linear at the winter wheat harvest but exponential at the summer maize harvest. Thus, the SNR can be predicted by the SNC according to their correlation at the harvest. The predicted SNR at the harvest of the previous crop, the target yield and NR for the subsequent crop obtained from long-term in-situ observations can be used to guide the fertilizer amounts applied to the following crop. Therefore, we developed a convenient method to optimize the fertilizer recommendation method for the winter wheat-summer maize cropping system.

J	Flatley, A; Rutherfurd, I; Sims, A				Flatley, Alissa; Rutherfurd, Ian; Sims, Alexander			Using Structure-from-Motion Photogrammetry to Improve Roughness Estimates for Headwater Dryland Streams in the Pilbara, Western Australia	REMOTE SENSING												There are numerous situations where engineers and managers need to estimate flow resistance (roughness) in natural channels. Most estimates of roughness in small streams come from humid areas. Ephemeral streams in arid and semi-arid areas have different morphology and vegetation that leads to different roughness characteristics, but roughness in this class of stream has seldom been studied. A lack of high-resolution spatial data hinders our understanding of channel form and vegetation composition. High resolution structure-from-motion (SfM)-derived point clouds allow us to estimate channel boundary roughness and quantify the influence of vegetation during bankfull flows. These point clouds show individual plants at centimetre accuracy. Firstly, a semi-supervised machine learning procedure called CANUPO was used to identify and map key geomorphic features within a series of natural channels in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Secondly, we described the variation within these reaches and the contribution of geomorphic forms and vegetation to the overall in-channel roughness. Channel types are divided into five reach types based on presence and absence of geomorphic forms: bedrock; alluvial single channel (>= cobble or sand dominated); alluvial multithread; composed of either nascent barforms or more established; stable alluvial islands. Using this reach classification as a guide, we present estimates of Manning's roughness within these channels drawing on an examination of 650 cross sections. The contribution of in-channel vegetation toward increasing channel roughness was investigated at bankfull flow conditions for a subset of reaches. Roughness within these channels is highly variable and established in-channel vegetation can provide between a 35-55% increase in total channel roughness across all channel types. This contribution is likely higher in shallow flows and identifies the importance of integrating vegetation and geomorphic features into restorative practices for these headwater channels. These results also guide Manning's selection for these semi-arid river systems and contribute to the vegetation-roughness literature within a relatively understudied region.

Growth and development of spring crops in competition with oat in the dryland Mediterranean climate of eastern Washington	WEED SCIENCE												Weed management during spring crop production in eastern Washington presents many challenges. Many spring crops are weak competitors with weeds. In May of 2010 and 2011, two spring crop trials were initiated near Pullman, WA, to compare the relative competitiveness of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.), and pea (Pisum sativum L.) using cultivated oat (Avena sativa L.) as a surrogate for wild oat (Avena fatua L.) competition. The experiment was arranged as a split-block split-plot design with four replications. One set of main plots included three oat density treatments (0, 63, and 127 plants m(-2)), while a second set included each crop species. Crop species main plots were then split into subplots of two different seeding rates (recommended and doubled). Crop populations decreased as oat density increased and increased as crop seeding rate increased. As oat density increased, preharvest crop biomass decreased for all crops, while oat biomass and yield increased. Oat biomass and yield were greater in legume plots compared with cereal plots. Increasing oat density decreased yields for all crops, whereas doubling crop seeding rate increased yields for barley and wheat in 2010 and barley in 2011. Compared with legumes, cereals were taller, produced more biomass, and were more competitive with oat.																			0043-1745	1550-2759				NOV	2020	68	6					646	653		10.1017/wsc.2020.56	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/wsc.2020.56													WOS:000639434300011
J	Yan, YJ; Li, JG; Li, JL; Jiang, T				Yan, Yujiang; Li, Jiangui; Li, Junli; Jiang, Teng			Spatiotemporal Changes in the Supply and Demand of Ecosystem Services in the Kaidu-Kongque River Basin, China	SUSTAINABILITY												The assessment of ecosystem service (ES) supply and demand is crucial for the sustainable development of dryland drainage basins. The natural ecosystems in the Kaidu-Kongque River Basin have experienced severe ecological degradation in recent years, and the ES supply and demand were contradicted due to water scarcity and excessive water utilization. In this paper, the supply-demand of five key ecosystem services were evaluated, and their spatial matching was also analyzed to provide total insights. The services assessed were food supply, water yield, carbon sequestration, habitat quality, and windbreak and sand fixation. We utilized various models, including InVEST, RWEQ, and GeoDa, to quantify and analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of ecosystem service supply and demand between 1990 and 2020. Our findings indicate that the supply and demand for all ecosystem services in the basin have increased over the last 30 years. However, the spatial distribution of supply and demand for each ecosystem service is not completely consistent. Except for windbreak and sand fixation, where supply exceeds demand, there is a spatial mismatch between supply and demand for each service. Furthermore, we observed a positive and synergistic correlation between the supply and demand of each ecosystem service, with water yield services being the dominant and limiting factor. The spatial correlation between the supply and demand of ecosystem services was dominated by "low supply-low demand", "high supply-high demand" spatial matching, and "low supply-high demand" mismatch, which could explain the variation in water yield from upstream to downstream. Based on our findings, we recommend policies and recommendations for ecological conservation and sustainable development in the Kaidu-Kongque River Basin. The ES supply and demand will become more reliable by increasing water supplies in the middle and lower reaches of the basin. Our results provide illumination for the maintenance and sustainability of ecosystem services in arid regions.						li, jun li/0000-0002-1054-5966														2071-1050				JUN 1	2023	15	11							8949	10.3390/su15118949	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15118949													WOS:001005058800001

A survey of green manure productivity on dryland organic grain farms in the eastern prairie region of Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE												Little is known about legume green manure productivity on organic farms. Soil and plant tissue were sampled in annual, biennial, and perennial green manures on 41 fields in the eastern prairies. Green manure biomass averaged 4572 kg ha(-1); 53% was legume plant material and 18% was weeds. Soil test P and plant tissue P concentrations were below critical levels in about half of all green manures. Mean N fixation was estimated at 71 kg ha(-1). This observational study provides a baseline for future research to optimize green manure and nutrient management in organic grain production systems.

Governments can intervene by structuring incentives for agricultural adaptations so that farmers can choose the ones that create more benefits for the society as a whole. This requires consideration of a range of different benefits to different groups within the social cost-benefit analysis (CBA). We assess the social and private profitability of two alternative tree-based adaptation techniques that have received state support in the traditional barley cropping/rangeland systems in Central Tunisia: olive tree plantation, and intercropping with cactus. The results showed that society does not benefit from offering incentives for olive production. The production of irrigated olive trees without incentives is profitable for farmers and for society, while rainfed plantation is not profitable at all. However, it is possible for farmers to increase their incomes without increasing agricultural water use if they are encouraged to adopt intercropping with cactus to supplement livestock food and watering. The findings highlight scope for policies to balance between returns both for society, and for farmers, as revealed through the application of quantitative social CBA.

J	Raza, S; Farmaha, BS				Raza, Sajjad; Farmaha, Bhupinder Singh			Contrasting corn yield responses to nitrogen fertilization in southeast coastal plain soils	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Nitrogen (N) fertilizer recommendations based on yield goals are common and do not consider variability in soil N supply between fields. Nitrogen transformations in soils are dynamic and may vary widely among different soils, climates, cropping systems, and management practices, making it difficult to provide general N recommendation rates for a region, state, or even a county. To optimize N fertilization rates for corn (Zea mays L.), eight field trials were conducted on different fields at the Edisto Research and Education Center of Clemson University in 2018-2021. The soils varied in pH, inorganic N, management practices (irrigate, dryland, cover, and no-cover crop), and climatic conditions (temperature and precipitation). Six nitrogen fertilizer rate treatments were used during 2018 and 2019, eight in 2020, and five in 2021 trials. Test sites were different in each year except in 2021 in which trials were conducted on the same site but were differentiated by multi-species and no-cover crop treatments. Nitrogen fertilizer was applied as a complete one-time dose in all trials in 2018 and 2021 and in several splits in 2019 and 2020. The corn yields generally increased with N fertilization rates; however, a strong variation of up to 4-11 Mg ha(-1) existed at each N level among different fields. Based on yield responses, the eight field trials were divided into two groups: low-yielding and high-yielding sites. The low-yielding sites on average produced 3.8 Mg ha(-1) of corn, which was 137% less than the corn harvested from high-yielding sites (9.0 Mg ha(-1)). The agronomic N use efficiency (AgNUE) in high-yielding sites was almost double (32.68 kg kg(-1) N) compared to low-yielding sites (17.16 kg kg(-1) N), and the differences were even wider for partial factor productivity of N (PFPN). The economic optimum N rate (EONR) remained below 300 kg N ha(-1) for all sites with no marked difference among sites. However, relative yield (ratio of corn yield in unfertilized control to the N level giving the highest yield) was comparatively lower in low-yielding sites (29.45%). Baseline inorganic N, pH, and precipitation were identified as the major factors controlling corn yield responses to N fertilization. The yield variations driven by several factors make N management challenging, indicating the need for site-specific N management for corn in the southeast United States.

We validated an LMD-based approach and then used that approach to evaluate CH4 emissions from indigenous dairy cows in a dryland area of Ethiopia. Methods: First, we validated our LMD-based approach in Simmental crossbred beef cattle (n = 2) housed in respiration chambers and fed either a high-or low-concentrate diet. From the results of the validation, we constructed an estimation equation to determine CH4 emissions from LMD CH4 concentrations. Next, we used our validated LMD approach to examine CH4 emissions in Fogera dairy cows grazed for 8 h/d (GG, n = 4), fed indoors on natural-grassland hay (CG1, n = 4), or fed indoors on Napier-grass (Pennisetum purpureum) hay (CG2, n = 4). All the cows were supplemented with concentrate feed. Results: The exhaled CH4 concentrations measured by LMD were linearly correlated with the CH4 emissions determined by infrared-absorption-based gas analyzer (r2 = 0.55). The estimation equation used to determine CH4 emissions (y, mg/min) from LMD CH4 concentrations (x, ppm m) was y = 0.4259x+38.61. Daily CH4 emissions of Fogera cows estimated by using the equation did not differ among the three groups; however, a numerically greater milk yield was obtained from the CG2 cows than from the GG cows, suggesting that Napier grass hay might be better than natural-grassland hay for indoor feeding. The CG1 cows had higher CH4 emissions per feed intake than the other groups, without significant increases in milk yield and body-weight gain, suggesting that natural-grassland hay cannot be recommended for indoor-fed cows. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate the potential of using LMDs to valuate feeding regimens rapidly and economically for dairy cows in areas under financial constraint, while taking CH4 emissions into consideration.

Accurate estimation of AGB and carbon stocks in this biome is important for addressing sustainable development goals as the information can aid natural resource management at varied spatial scales. Previous AGB mapping efforts focused on humid forests, with little attention on savannas. This study explored the use of annual monthly time-series of Senitinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data to map AGB in the SS. Backscatter, spectral reflectance, and derivatives (vegetation indices and biophysical parameters) were combined with field inventory data in a Random Forest regression to map AGB. Eight experiments were conducted with different data configurations to determine: (1) the potential of S-1 and S-2 for AGB mapping, (2) optimal image acquisition period for AGB mapping, and (3) contribution of image derivatives to improving the accuracy of AGB mapping. The predicted map was validated with 40% of the inventory data. Uncertainty in the AGB was assessed using mean absolute error, root mean squared error, coefficient of determination and symmetrical mean absolute percentage error. Results show that about 90% of the study area have low AGB stocks of less than 90 Mg/ha. Compared to S-1 (RMSE: 78.6; MAE: 25.6), S-2 achieved better prediction accuracy (RMSE: 60.6; MAE: 19.2), although combination of the two according to seasonality produced the best results (RMSE: 45.4; MAE: 16.3). Images acquired in the dry season were found to be more useful for predicting AGB than those of rainy season. Also, stress-related vegetation indices and a red-edge dependent normalized difference vegetation index not tested in previous AGB studies using Sentinels were found to be significant contributors to the superior performance of S-2. Since biomass is a finite resource, our results can provide valuable information on the sustainable use of biomass and energy security including studies on carbon cycling and ecosystem functions in the region. The demonstrated possibility of using open access earth observation data to map and monitor AGB in data scarce regions is useful and beneficial to attaining SDG indicators 15.2.1 (sustainable forest management) and 15.3.1 (proportion of land that is degraded over total land area). Further work on developing species-specific wood densities and allometric equations is required to improve AGB and carbon stock estimation in the SS.

Effects of rearing systems on production performance, antioxidant capacity and immune status of meat ducks at different ages	ANIMAL												As potential substitutes for traditional free-range rearing system, floor-rearing system (FRS) and netrearing system (NRS) are the current predominant dryland duck rearing systems. However, the influence of these two systems on production performance and duck health is poorly understood. In this study, a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement with two rearing systems (FRS and NRS) and three ages (4w, 8w and 13w) was conducted to study the effects of FRS and NRS on production, antioxidant capacity and immune status of Nonghua ducks. The production performance was mainly affected by the effect of rearing systems at 8w. Body weight, average daily gain, eviscerated weight and semi-eviscerated weight were higher in NRS ducks at 8w, but carcass yield at 8w and 13w was decreased (P < 0.05). Lipid deposition was enhanced in NRS and higher sebum and abdominal fat yields were seen at 8w and 13w (P < 0.05). NRS resulted in developmental retardation of the liver at 4w and decreased gizzard index at all ages (P < 0.05). Antioxidant capacity indicators were unaffected by rearing systems (P > 0.05), however, in NRS, slightly better antioxidant capacity was seen at 4w, while glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity was higher at 13w (P < 0.05). NRS ducks had higher thymus weight at 8w and higher spleen weight at 13w (P < 0.05). Immune cytokines were extensively affected by rearing system (P < 0.05) and higher levels of interferon-gamma, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-4 and immunoglobulins were seen in NRS ducks. Serum biochemical parameters (aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)) showed that NRS was better for liver health, and in the liver of FRS ducks, ALP was higher at 13w, and both ALP and interferon-gamma were higher at 13w than at 4w and 8w (P < 0.05). In conclusion, this study showed that NRS was, to an extent, conducive to production performance and duck liver health, but compared to FRS, defects were seen in visceral organ development and lipid deposition. Although antioxidant capacity was not significantly affected, NRS ducks may have better antioxidant capacity at the early breeding stage, and GSH-Px activity was increased for scavenging excess free radicals at the later one. NRS increased serum levels of interferon-gamma, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-4 and immunoglobulins and promoted thymus and spleen development, thus improving duck immune function. These findings will provide a reliable reference for selecting a rearing system. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

How-ever, the effect of their long-term use on sustaining crop production remain unclear, especially under dryland conditions. A field experiment was conducted for nine years (2013-2021) in the Loess Plateau region of China to evaluate the effects of normal flat sowing with land fully covered by plastic film mulch (P), ridge-furrow planting with 50% coverage with mulch (R), normal flat sowing with land fully covered by biodegradable film mulch (B), and normal flat sowing without mulching (CK). Mulching treatments (P, R, and B) decreased the bulk density of the surface 0.6 m (P < 0.05), and increased the soil porosity (4.1-7.6%). In addition, there was an increase in meso-and macroaggregates contents, as evidenced by wet sieving (54.3-104.9%) and dry sieving (1.1-10.4%) methods. The carbon contents varied with soil depth. Major portion carbon was observed to be retained in the microaggregates under CK (69.5%) while it moved to mesoaggregates (47.8-56.7%) with plastic mulching. Higher soil water contentment were maintained in soils under plastic mulches. Overall improvements in surface 1.0 m soil, where most of the roots reside, were 47, 26 and, 20 mm under P, R, and B, respectively, and 28, 17, and 4 mm in 1.0-2.0 m soil. As a consequence of the maintaining superior better hydro-physical regimes, the grain yield, averaged over 9-years, improved by 4784 (P), 2746 (R), and 2413 kg ha-1 (B) over control. The rainwater was also extracted efficiently by maize. The resultant water use efficiency was 3.2, 2.8, 2.7, and 2.1 kg m3 under P, R, B and CK, respectively. Based on these observations, flat planting plastic film mulching with full surface cover seems a viable option to improve maize productivity under rainfed conditions of the Loess Plateau region.

Sympatric pairings of dryland grass populations, mycorrhizal fungi and associated soil biota enhance mutualism and ameliorate drought stress	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												There is evidence that the distribution of ecotypes of plants and their symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and other associated soil biota may be structured by the availability of essential soil nutrients; and that locally adapted partnerships most successfully acquire limiting nutrients. This study tests the hypotheses that plant genotypes are adapted to the water availability of their local environment, and this adaptation involves associations with local soil biota, including AM fungi. We grew semi-arid Bouteloua gracilis ecotypes from relatively wet and dry sites, with either sympatric or allopatric soil inoculum under moderate and extreme soil drying treatments to examine (a) how varying degrees of water limitation influence grass responses to soil biota and (b) the relationship between AM fungal structures and the responses. Under extreme soil drying, the dry site ecotype tended to perform better than the wet site ecotype. Both ecotypes performed best in either drying treatment when inoculated with their sympatric soil biota. Sympatric pairings produced more AM fungal hyphae, arbuscules and dark septate fungi. Extreme soil drying tended to accentuate these apparent benefits of sympatry to both plants and fungal symbionts, relative to the moderate drying treatment. Our findings support the hypothesis that AM symbioses help Bouteloua gracilis ecotypes adapt to local water availability. This conclusion is based on the observations that as water became increasingly limited, sympatric partnerships produced more AM fungal hyphae and arbuscules and fewer vesicles. The abundances of hyphae and arbuscules were positively correlated with plant growth, suggesting that in sympatric pairs of plants and AM fungi, allocation to fungal structures is optimized to maximize benefits and minimize the costs of the symbioses. This provides strong evidence that co-adaptation among plants and their associated AM fungi can ameliorate drought stress. Synthesis. Our study documents the role of locally adapted soil borne plant symbionts in ameliorating water stress. We found a relationship between AM fungal structures in roots and plant performance. Generally, plants and fungi from the same site resulted in more positive effects on plant growth.

Crop water use efficiency from eddy covariance methods in cold water-limited regions	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Crop-water interactions define productivity in water-limited dryland agricultural production systems in cold regions. Despite the agronomic and economic importance of this relationship there are challenges in quantifying crop water use efficiency (WUE). To understand dynamics driving crop water use and agricultural productivity in these environments, observations of evapotranspiration, carbon assimilation, meteorology, and crop growth were collected over 17 site-years at 5 agricultural sites in the sub-humid continental Canadian Prairies. Eddycovariance (EC) derived water and carbon fluxes provided a means to comprehensively assess the WUE of current agricultural practices by both physiological (WUEP: g C kg-1 H2O) and agronomic (WUEY): kg yield mm H2O-1 hectare- 1) approaches. Mean field scale WUEY for grain yields were 10.4 (Barley), 10.2 (Wheat), 6.0 (Canola), 19.3 (Peas), 12.2 (Lentils) and for silage/forage crops were 23.0 (Barley), 11.9 (Forage), and 20.7 (Corn) (kg yield mm H2O-1 hectare- 1). An assessment of environmental factors and their covariance with WUE, utilising a conditional inference tree approach, demonstrated that WUE decreased when crops were under greater evapotranspiration demands. EC-based areal WUE approaches, measuring fluxes over footprints of hundreds of square metres, were compared with more commonly reported point-scale water balance residual approaches (WUEWB) and demonstrated consistently smaller magnitudes. WUEWB was greater than EC-estimated WUEY by an average of 52% and 65% for grain and forage/silage crops respectively. WUEWB also had greater variability than EC estimates, with standard deviations 188% and 128% greater than Barley and Wheat crops, respectively. This comparison highlights the scale dependency of WUE estimation methods, demonstrates considerable uncertainty in point scale water balance approaches due to spatial variability in crop-water interactions, and shows how this variability can be accounted for by EC observations. This improves the understanding of WUE and quantifies its variability in cold continental water-limited climates and provides a means to diagnose improved agricultural water management.

G.			Effects of human-induced land degradation on water and carbon fluxes in two different Brazilian dryland soil covers	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The Brazilian semiarid region presents a physical water scarcity and high seasonal and interannual irregularities of precipitation, known as a region with periodic droughts. This region is mainly covered by the Caatinga biome, recognized as a Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest (SDTF). Soil water availability directly impacts the ecosystem's functioning, characterized by low fertility and sparse vegetation cover during the dry season, making it a fragile ecosystem vulnerable to climatic variations. Additionally, this region has been suffering from several issues due to human activities over the centuries, which has resulted in extensive areas being severely degraded, which aggravates the impacts from climatic variations and the susceptibility to desertification. Thus, studying the soil-plantatmosphere continuum in this region can help better understand the seasonal and annual behavior of the water and carbon fluxes. This study investigated the dynamics of water and carbon fluxes during four years (2013-2016) by using eddy covariance (EC) measurements within two areas of Caatinga (dense Caatinga (DC) and sparse Caatinga (SC)) that suffered anthropic pressures. The two study areas showed similar behavior in relation to physical parameters (air temperature, incoming radiation, vapor pressure deficit, and relative humidity), except for soil temperature. The SC area presented a surface temperature of 3 degrees C higher than the DC, related to their vegetation cover differences. The SC area had higher annual evapotranspiration, representing 74% of the precipitation for the DC area and 90% for the SC area. The two areas acted as a carbon sink during the study period, with the SC area showing a lower CO2 absorption capacity. On average, the DC area absorbs 2.5 times more carbon than the SC area, indicating that Caatinga deforestation affects evaporative fluxes, reducing atmospheric carbon fixation and influencing the ability to mitigate the effects of increased greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.

We also measured tree size (height, stem diameter, and crown area), leaf structure (leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf dry matter content), and leaf nutrient concentrations (C, N, P, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn).ResultsThe concentration of most soil nutrients was higher under the P. pallida canopy. Tree size affected positively the soil C, N, and P concentrations, while leaf structural traits such as LMA were negatively related to the soil C, N, and P concentrations. The relationships between the nutrient concentrations in the leaf and soil were only significant for P and Mn. The tree size effect was greater in those populations where the temperature was lower, suggesting the fertility island effect can be increased or weakened by climatic factors.ConclusionsP. pallida have a significant though limited fertility island effect regulated by plant traits and influenced by climatic factors.

Such crops suitable for system integration should preferably be dual-purpose and resource-use efficient. Keeping this in view, a two-year study was conducted at NMSU Rex E. Kirksey Agricultural Science Center, Tucumcari, New Mexico, comprised of 10 annual crop species including grasses, legumes, and oilseed crops. The study aimed at researching yield potential and water use efficiency of the selected crops under dryland and limited irrigated conditions in the semiarid, subtropical environment. Results suggest that both crop species and water regime (irrigated vs. dryland) had significant effects on seed and biomass yield and water use efficiencies (WUE) (P<0.05). Seed and biomass production under dryland conditions were significantly influenced each year by amount of precipitation received. Pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.] had consistently greater seed and biomass yields and WUEs than the other crops. Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and sesbania (Sesbania sesban) proved to be viable legumes with the advantage of greater biomass yields and water-use efficiency (WUEs) compared to other the legumes tested (P<0.05). For a balanced livestock diet, pearl millet+cowpea intercrop combination is a good option with greater yields and WUEs. Integrating these rotation crops into the traditional winter wheat cropping systems or alternate cropping systems may provide a significant benefit to producers in the semiarid southwestern United States.																			0883-8542	1943-7838					2022	38	6					845	851		10.13031/aea.15030845	http://dx.doi.org/10.13031/aea.15030845													WOS:000926490900002

However, different RHMP methods lead to differences in soil water availability, which must be matched with appropriate amounts of fertilizer to obtain further improvements in farmland productivity. In this study, we conducted a long-term (2014-2019) in situ experiment by using a split-plot design with four planting methods (control treatment, NN, no film mulching and no ridge; RHMP, HS, half-film mulching and single ridge; HN, half-film mulching and no ridge; FD, full-film mulching and double ridge) as main treatments and four fertilizer application levels (N, no fertilizer; L, low fertilizer; M, medium fertilizer; and H, high fertilizer, with N:P2O5 rates of 0:0, 150:75, 300:150, and 450:225 kg ha-1, respectively) as subtreatments. We studied the long-term soil water dynamics, crop growth responses, and economic benefits under the interactive effects of RHMP and fertilization. The results showed that RHMP changed the pattern of soil water consumption and recovery, thereby making it more compatible with the water demand of spring maize, and improving the water availability. Compared with NN, HS, HN, and FD increased the evapotranspiration by 8.7, 12.5, and 20.7 mm, respectively, the yield by 19.8%, 21.1%, and 69.4%, and the water use efficiency by 17.5%, 17.8%, and 61.8%. Under the same RHMP method, fertilization increased the consumption of soil water by crops but improved the water use efficiency. Compared with N, L, M, and H increased the evapotranspiration by 13.1 mm, 14.1 mm, and 15.4 mm, respectively, the yield by 198.7%, 228.5%, and 243.7%, and the water use efficiency increased significantly by 190.0%, 218.2%, and 231.9%. Due to the high variability of inter-annual rainfall (differences up to 419.1 mm during 2014-2019), the soil water availability varied significantly in different years, thereby affecting the yield and economic benefits. We also analyzed the responses in terms of the grain yield and net income to fertilizer application, as well as the soil water storage in the 0-200 cm soil layer before sowing under different RHMP methods. The amount of fertilizer that obtains the best yield and maximum economic benefit in the current year can be evaluated according to the soil water conditions before sowing in order to maximize the production of spring maize in the current season.

The excessive use of synthetic fertilizer can lead to soil compaction, acidification, and degeneration, which can all be mitigated through additional organic manure application. The combined application of organic manure and inorganic fertilizer plays crucial roles in the root morphology and yield formation of dryland crops. In this study, foxtail millet (Chang Sheng 07) was used as the experimental material and sown in a dry farming area with five different fertilizing patterns, which were composed of chemical N, P, organic manure, and microbial manure. These patterns included a single application of 45 kg center dot ha-1 of nitrogen fertilizer as the control (N45), the combined application of 60 kg center dot ha-1 of nitrogen fertilizer with 30 kg center dot ha-1 of phosphorus fertilizer (N60P30), the combined application of 90 kg center dot ha-1 of nitrogen fertilizer with 45 kg center dot ha-1 of phosphorus fertilizer (N90P45), 60 kg center dot ha-1 of nitrogen fertilizer and 40 kg center dot ha-1 of phosphorus fertilizer with 2000 kg center dot ha-1 of organic manure (N60P40-O), and 60 kg center dot ha-1 of nitrogen fertilizer and 40 kg center dot ha-1 of phosphorus fertilizer with 5 kg center dot ha-1 of microbial manure (N60P40-M). Each treatment was performed with four repeats. The results show that (1) the different fertilization patterns had significant effects on the morphological construction of foxtail millet roots, and the root length (RL) with N60P40-O underwent a significant increase of 88.23% and 61.59% in the two stages, respectively, (2) as confirmed by the correlation analysis, the root surface area (RSA) was positively correlated with the RL and root volume (RV), (3) the yields with N90P45 and N60P30 exhibited a significant increase of 54.43% and 59.86%, and those with N60P40-O and N60P40-M stably increased by 13.12-24.11% compared to those with N45, and (4) the water use efficiency (WUE) of foxtail millet under the N60P30 and N90P45 patterns significantly increased by 33.40-62.39%, while that under the N60P40-O and N60P40-M patterns increased by 12.89-29.20%. In summary, the application of additional organic matter and microbial manure promoted the morphological construction of foxtail millet roots, led to better stability in grain production, and is an ecofriendly option in terms of sustainable land use.																				2073-4395				NOV	2023	13	11							2847	10.3390/agronomy13112847	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13112847													WOS:001115299000001

However, advances are still needed to guide choices regarding soil origin and inoculum production methods, since outcomes can vary due to plant-soil feedbacks (PSF). We evaluate how soil origin and host plant used for inoculum production affect AMF community and therefore the plant biomass accumulation and functional traits. In the conditioning phase, we investigated whether soils originating from a recovered area (Quarry) and a vegetation fragment (Caatinga) would have their AMF communities modified due to the growth of Sorghum bicolor (used for inoculum production) and Senna uniflora (used in Brazilian semiarid restoration). In the feedback phase, we compared the performance of four plants species growing on a degraded soil and inoculated or not by a mixture of AMF isolates in comparison to soil inoculum prepared from the conditioning phase. The inoculum from Caatinga presented seven times more AMF species compared to that from the Quarry, which presented ruderal and stress tolerant species. The soil inoculum conditioned by S. uniflora, regardless of origin, presented greater evenness compared to the soil inoculum produced with S. bicolor and promoted 33% more plant biomass compared to the control without inoculation. Root colonization by AMF increased PSF and decreased plant investment in functional traits such as specific root length (SRL) and specific leaf area (SLA). Our results demonstrate the importance of adopting strategies that preserve local adaptation of inoculants produced. The use of native plant for propagation of native AMF in the conditioning phase provided more positive responses for Mesosphaerum suaveolens and Rhaphiodon echinus than inoculated with introduced AMF isolates. This is probably due to the interaction of inoculated plants with responsive AMF present in the soil. Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that conditioning field-collected soil with Senna uniflora and using it for inoculation can be a simple technique to promote biomass accumulation for other native herbaceous species. This preserves the compatibility between the soil inoculum produced with native AMF and native plants, representing an important tool for restoration programs.

Precipitation, vegetation productivity, and human impacts control home range size of elephants in dryland systems in northern Namibia	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Climatic variability, resource availability, and anthropogenic impacts heavily influence an animal's home range. This makes home range size an effective metric for understanding how variation in environmental factors alter the behavior and spatial distribution of animals. In this study, we estimated home range size of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) across four sites in Namibia, along a gradient of precipitation and human impact, and investigated how these gradients influence the home range size on regional and site scales. Additionally, we estimated the time individuals spent within protected area boundaries. The mean 50% autocorrelated kernel density estimate for home range was 2200 km(2) [95% CI:1500-3100 km(2)]. Regionally, precipitation and vegetation were the strongest predictors of home range size, accounting for a combined 53% of observed variation. However, different environmental covariates explained home range variation at each site. Precipitation predicted most variation (up to 74%) in home range sizes (n = 66) in the drier western sites, while human impacts explained 71% of the variation in home range sizes (n = 10) in Namibia's portion of the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area. Elephants in all study areas maintained high fidelity to protected areas, spending an average of 85% of time tracked on protected lands. These results suggest that while most elephant space use in Namibia is driven by natural dynamics, some elephants are experiencing changes in space use due to human modification.

A split-split plot-based study on a randomized complete block design with four replicates was used as an experimental design. The main factor was irrigation at three levels, including control without irrigation, supplementary irrigation in the booting stage, and supplementary irrigation in the booting and flowering stages. Two wheat cultivars, namely, Sardari and Sirvan, as sub-factors and application of bio-fertilizers in eight levels, including the use of bio-fertilizers containing: Mycorrhiza, Seaweed extract, Nitrozist and Phosphozist, Mycorrhiza + Nitrozist and Phosphozist, Seaweed extract + Nitrozist and Phosphozist, Mycorrhiza + Seaweed extract, Mycorrhiza + Nitrozist and Phosphozist + Seaweed extract, and non-application of bio-fertilizers, were considered as sub-factors. The results of both seasons of the experiment showed that the application of bio-fertilizers compared to the control treatment at all irrigation levels increased root volume, leaf relative water content (RWC), membrane stability index (MSI), and photosynthetic pigment content. The highest amount of H2O2, proline, and soluble carbohydrates were obtained in wheat under dry land conditions, and supplementary irrigation, especially two-time irrigation, significantly reduced the values of these traits. Supplementary irrigation also increased grain yield, so that in the conditions of two-time irrigation compared to the non-irrigation treatment (dry land), in the first and second seasons, the grain yield increased by 79.51 and 78.69%, respectively. Application of bio-fertilizers (Mycorrhiza + Nitrozist and Phosphozist + Seaweed extract) in comparison with the non-application of these fertilizers, due to increased root volume, RWC, MSI, and content of photosynthetic pigments, increased the grain yield in the first and second seasons of the experiment by 8.04 and 6.96%, respectively. As a result, suitable microorganisms and seaweed can improve wheat resistance mechanisms to water deficit, which along with using supplementary irrigation that saves water consumption improves plant growth and yield in areas faced with water shortage.																			1664-462X					JUN 1	2022	13								855090	10.3389/fpls.2022.855090	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.855090								35720598					WOS:000811903100001

We therefore examined the effect of pollination intensification on sunflower yield and productivity under various levels of soil fertilization over two seasons in the eastern Free State, South Africa. We manipulated soil fertility with fertilizer applications and pollination with exclusion bags. We found a synergetic effect between pollination and soil fertilization whereby increasing pollination intensity led to a far higher impact on sunflower yield when the soil had been fertilized. Specifically, the intensification of insect pollination increased seed yield by approximately 0.4 ton/ha on nutrient poor soil and by approximately 1.7 ton/ha on moderately fertilized soil. Our findings suggest that sunflower crops on adequate balanced soil fertility will receive abundant insect pollination and may gain more from both synergies than crops grown in areas with degraded soil fertility.						van der Merwe, Sean/0000-0002-8623-8639													0021-8596	1469-5146				APR	2021	159	3-4					258	271	PII S0021859621000514	10.1017/S0021859621000514	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0021859621000514													WOS:000721296800001

Impact of wheat-vetch temporary intercropping on soil functions and grain yield in a dryland semi-arid environment	PLANT AND SOIL												Background and aimsWhile a limited number of studies have investigated cereal-legume temporary intercropping in organic systems, the potential for temporary intercropping to improve soil properties or cash crop yield/quality in conventional systems remains unknown.MethodsA field experiment comparing monoculture wheat to wheat with a temporary (9 week) vetch intercrop was conducted in a water-limited environment. Wheat root growth and biomass, plant available water (PAW) and soil mineral nitrogen (N) were measured at anthesis (9 weeks after vetch termination) and grain yield/protein were determined at maturity. Soil parameters including soil total carbon (C) and N, hot water extractable C (HWC), water soluble C (WSC), citrate-extractable protein, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and soil enzyme activities were also assessed.ResultsCompared to monoculture wheat, temporary vetch-wheat intercropping increased MBC, HWC and WSC by 37%, 15% and 7%, respectively, across the monitoring period. Temporary intercropping increased the activity of C- and N-acquiring enzymes by 45% compared to monoculture wheat. At anthesis, the intercrop treatment had 30 mm more PAW and an additional 20 kg mineral N ha(-1) to 90 cm depth than the monoculture wheat. This didn't result in higher grain yields, presumably because spring rainfall was adequate for grain filling, and didn't increase grain protein, likely because the system wasn't N-limited.ConclusionHigher mineral N and PAW under wheat-vetch intercrops at anthesis suggests temporary intercropping could increase wheat grain protein under the right conditions, and potentially increase grain yields in seasons with limited rainfall during grain filling.

Supplemental irrigation (SI) with brackish water can reduce the negative impacts of dry spells on net CO2 assimilation in rainfed farming in semi-arid tropical regions and maintain crop productivity. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the net carbon assimilation rates, indexes for water use efficiency, and indicators of salt and water stress in maize plants under different water scenarios, with and without supplemental irrigation with brackish water. The experiment followed a randomized block design in a split-plot design with four replications. The main plots simulated four water scenarios found in the Brazilian semi-arid region (Rainy, Normal, Drought, and Severe Drought), while the subplots were with or without supplemental irrigation using brackish water with an electrical conductivity of 4.5 dS m(-1). The dry spells reduced the photosynthetic capacity of maize, especially under the Drought (70% reduction) and Severe Drought scenarios (79% reduction), due to stomatal and nonstomatal effects. Supplemental irrigation with brackish water reduced plant water stress, averted the excessive accumulation of salts in the soil and sodium in the leaves, and improved CO2 assimilation rates. The supplemental irrigation with brackish water also promoted an increase in the physical water productivity, reaching values 1.34, 1.91, and 3.03 times higher than treatment without SI for Normal, Drought, and Severe Drought scenarios, respectively. Thus, the use of brackish water represents an important strategy that can be employed in biosaline agriculture for tropical semi-arid regions, which are increasingly impacted by water shortage. Future studies are required to evaluate this strategy in other important crop systems under nonsimulated conditions, as well as the long-term effects of salts on different soil types in this region.

Dryland Cropping Systems, Weed Communities, and Disease Status Modulate the Effect of Climate Conditions on Wheat Soil Bacterial Communities	MSPHERE												Little knowledge exists on how soil bacteria in agricultural settings are impacted by management practices and environmental conditions in current and predicted climate scenarios. We assessed the impact of soil moisture, soil tempera ture, weed communities, and disease status on soil bacterial communities in three cropping systems: (i) conventional no-till (CNT) systems utilizing synthetic pesticides and herbicides, (ii) USDA-certified tilled organic (OT) systems, and (iii) USDA-certified organic systems with sheep grazing (OG). Sampling date within the growing season and associated soil temperature and moisture exerted the greatest effect on bacterial communities, followed by cropping system, Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) infection status, and weed community. Soil temperature was negatively correlated with bacterial richness and evenness, while soil moisture was positively correlated with bacterial richness and evenness. Soil temperature and soil moisture independently altered soil bacterial community similarity between treatments. Inoculation of wheat with WSMV altered the associated soil bacteria, and there were interactions between disease status and cropping system, sampling date, and climate conditions, indicating the effect of multiple stressors on bacterial communities in soil. In May and July, cropping system altered the effect of climate change on the bacterial community composition in hotter conditions and in hotter and drier conditions compared to ambient conditions, in samples not treated with WSMV. Overall, this study indicates that predicted climate modifications as well as biological stressors play a fundamental role in the impact of cropping systems on soil bacterial communities. IMPORTANCE Climate change is affecting global moisture and temperature patterns, and its impacts are predicted to worsen over time, posing progressively larger threats to food production. In the Northern Great Plains of the United States, climate change is forecast to increase temperature and decrease precipitation during the summer, and it is expected to negatively affect cereal crop production and pest management. In this study, temperature, soil moisture, weed communities, and disease status had interactive effects with cropping system on bacterial communities. As local climates continue to shift, the dynamics of aboveand belowground associated biodiversity will also shift, which will impact food production and increase the need for more sustainable practices.

This paper presents ethnobotanical documentation of medicinal plants of Mutomo hill plant sanctuary and its environs. An ethnobotanical survey was carried out in Mutomo hill plant sanctuary and its environs with 48 herbalists aged between 32 and 96 years from July 2018 to February 2019 using a semistructured open-ended questionnaire. The plants were collected through random surveys with each herbalist in different ecotypes around the villages and within the Mutomo hill plant sanctuary. The Relative Frequency of Citation (RFC) for each species reported was calculated to determine the plant species frequently collected. In total, 68 different plant species distributed in 28 families and 54 genera were reported. The frequently used plant families were Leguminosae (13 species), Lamiaceae (6 species), and Euphorbiaceae (6 species). Shrubs (37%) and trees (34%) were the dominant growth habits reported. The most cited plant species were Cassia abbreviata Oliv. (RFC = 0.63), Acacia nilotica (L.). Delile (RFC = 0.54), Strychnos heningsii Gilg (RFC = 0.46), and Aloe secundiflora Engl. (RFC = 0.31). Root (19 species) and bark (19 species) were the frequently collected plant parts. Infectious diseases (33) and digestive system disorders (24) were reported to be managed with the majority of the plant species. This study contributes to safeguarding the traditional knowledge on medicinal plants in the study area, which is useful in appreciating and acknowledging the cultural heritage of the Kamba people from the local perspective of Mutomo area in Kenya. It also adds to the knowledge base and documentation of medicinal plants, which is useful information as potential data for drug development.					hu, guangwan/AAS-7344-2021; Rono, Peninah/GZL-4990-2022	hu, guangwan/0000-0001-7728-7976; Musili, Paul Mutuku/0000-0003-4610-4828; wang, qing feng/0000-0001-9143-8849; Mutie, Fredrick Munyao/0000-0001-7666-2922													1741-427X	1741-4288				MAR 17	2020	2020								1543831	10.1155/2020/1543831	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/1543831								32256635					WOS:000522960300001

However, few studies exist on the efficacy of this technology in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). This research compared the herbicide efficacy (reduction in weed density and cover) of WEED-IT and WeedSeeker spot spraying systems to uniform spraying in fallow and postharvest in 2019 and 2020. Weed community types included naturally occurring weeds, natural + Russian thistle (Salsola tragus L.), or natural + kochia (Bassia scoparia (L.) A. J. Scott). Herbicides included glyphosate or the pre-mix bromoxynil + pyrasulfotole. Additionally, herbicide efficacy was studied with short stubble (~10 cm), tall stubble (~25 cm), and normal stubble (~20 cm) with chaff and straw removed. In fallow, herbicide efficacy was 1.5 times higher for uniform applications than for WEED-IT or WeedSeeker in 2019 and 2020. Herbicide efficacy was also 1.9 times higher for uniform applications in postharvest in 2019 but no differences were found in 2020. The weed community impacted herbicide efficacy but herbicide efficacy did not differ between residue management treatments. Finally, WEED-IT and WeedSeeker used 53% less herbicide volume in comparison to uniform applications. This research demonstrated that spot spraying technology can be efficacious and economical for growers in the PNW.					, Judit/C-4507-2015	, Judit/0000-0002-4453-275X														2223-7747				DEC	2021	10	12							2725	10.3390/plants10122725	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants10122725								34961195					WOS:000737873700001

Germination and early establishment of dryland grasses and shrubs on intact and wind-eroded soils under greenhouse conditions	PLANT AND SOIL												Aims Grassland-to-shrubland transition is a common form of land degradation in drylands worldwide. It is often attributed to changes in disturbance regimes, particularly overgrazing. A myriad of direct and indirect effects (e.g., accelerated soil erosion) of grazing may favor shrubs over grasses, but their relative importance is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that topsoil "winnowing" by wind erosion would differentially affect grass and shrub seedling establishment to promote shrub recruitment over that of grass. Methods We monitored germination and seedling growth of contrasting perennial grass (Bouteloua eriopoda, Sporobolus airoides, and Aristida purpurea) and shrub (Prosopis glandulosa, Atriplex canescens, and Larrea tridentata) functional groups on field-collected non-winnowed and winnowed soils under well-watered greenhouse conditions. Results Non-winnowed soils were finer-textured and had higher nutrient contents than winnowed soils, but based on desorption curves, winnowed soils had more plant-available moisture. Contrary to expectations, seed germination and seedling growth on winnowed and non-winnowed soils were comparable within a given species. The N-2-fixing deciduous shrub P. glandulosa was first to emerge and complete germination, and had the greatest biomass accumulation of all species. Conclusions Germination and early seedling growth of grasses and shrubs on winnowed soils were not adversely nor differentially affected comparing with that observed on non-winnowed soils under well-watered greenhouse conditions. Early germination and rapid growth may give P. glandulosa a competitive advantage over grasses and other shrub species at the establishment stage in grazed grasslands. Field establishment experiments are needed to confirm our findings in these controlled environment trials.

J	Fan, W; Wu, JG				Fan, Wei; Wu, Jinggui			Changes in soil fungal community on SOC and POM accumulation under different straw return modes in dryland farming	ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY												We conducted a 2.5-year field experiment to test the effects of straw incorporated evenly into the soil (EIS) on soil fungal community, SOC chemical composition, and particulate organic matter fractions via comparing with no straw returning (CK), straw mulching (SM), straw plowed into the soil (SP), and identified the linkages between soil fungal community as well as organic C accumulation and POM formation. Our results showed that EIS treatment significantly increased the concentrations of SOC and the proportion of carbohydrate C, di-O-alkyl C, and O-alkyl C in SOC structure, increased the mass proportion and OC contents of MA(c)POM and mM-POM in the upper 40 cm of soil. Meanwhile, EIS treatment increased the relative abundance of Ascomycota, Zygomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Dothideomycetes in 0-20 cm depths, and also had the highest relative abundance of Glomeromycetes and Dothideomycetes in the 20-40 cm soil. Also, our study suggests that straw return enhanced the relative abundances of fungi involved in the carbon cycle and sequestration, including Zygomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Glomeromycota, and Ascomycota. The shifts in fungal community structure can accelerate organic C accumulation and the formation of soil particulate organic matter, especially in EIS treatment.						fan, wei/0000-0003-0012-118X													2096-4129	2332-8878				JAN 1	2021	7	1							1935326	10.1080/20964129.2021.1935326	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20964129.2021.1935326													WOS:000679113500001

However, the responses of soil P cycle genes and PSM communities to long-term high-P fertilizer application are less known in the Chinese Loess Plateau. In this study, metagenomics was used to explore the shifts in the abundance and compositions of soil P cycle genes and PSM communities at a long-term (14 years) trial site with four P fertilization rates. Long-term high-P (200 kg P2O5 ha-1 year-1) inputs resulted in a decrease in the abundance of the P-starvation response genes (phoR and phoP), the high-affinity phosphate-specific transporter (pst), the inorganic P-solubilization, and organic P-mineralization genes (gcd, pqq, and phoD). Long-term P inputs increased the abundance of phosphate-solubilizing bacteria but decreased the abundance of phosphate-solubilizing fungi and weakened the relationship of relevant key soil P genes. Soil total P, inorganic P, available P (AP), dissolved organic C contents, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were significantly related to soil P cycle genes and PSM community structure. In conclusion, the changes in soil P cycle genes and microbial P solubilization capacity under long-term P input conditions were mainly regulated by soil AP content and ALP activity, while long-term high-P inputs increased soil mineral P immobilization by altering the expression of soil P cycle genes and the PSM functional profiles. These consequences provide a new view for the study of soil P cycles in agricultural ecosystems with P inputs.

Schott] has the potential to address food and nutrition insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the nutrient content of taro is yet to be fully elucidated. The objective of this study was to evaluate mineral element content as a proxy for nutritional value of different taro genotypes. The study evaluated 14 taro accessions at Roodeplaat and Umbumbulu in South Africa based on their calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), sodium (Na), phosphorous (P) and zinc (Zn) content. The accessions were planted in a randomized complete block design, replicated three times under field conditions. The mineral element content varied significantly (p < 0.05) among the genotypes. Genotypes Amad7-2, Umbu8 and Amad101 exhibited high Ca (>= 432 mg kg(-1)), Fe (>= 32 mg kg(-1)) and Mg (>= 229 mg kg(-1)) across the locations. The first principal component (PC) accounted for 33.7% of the variation and was strongly associated with Zn (r = 0.94, p < 0.001) and P (r = 0.89, p < 0.001). The second PC explained 29.7% of the variation and was associated with Na (r = 0.83, p < 0.001), Mg (r = 0.76, p < 0.001) and K (r = 0.55, p < 0.05). Fe and Mn contributed below the 12.5% threshold to the PCs and were considered as less discriminatory among the accessions. The negative correlations among some of the mineral elements would be a challenge for selection and breeding of nutritious taro accessions. This information is essential to select superior local accessions based on their mineral element content for developing breeding populations and lines for improving nutrition quality among poor households in sub-Saharan Africa.

However, few studies have investigated the border effect based on photosynthesis, especially under rainfed conditions. Here, we evaluated the yield in rainfed wheat/maize strip relay intercropping, and explored the associated differences in yield components and physiological process compared to sole crops. A two-year field experiments was conducted including three treatments (sole wheat, sole maize and wheat/maize intercropping) in Yangling, located in the semi-humid region of northwest China. Grain yield, yield components, chlorophyll relative content (SPAD) and photosynthetic parameters in different rows were measured for wheat and maize. Results showed that wheat/maize intercropping increased the land use efficiency and total yield of wheat and maize under rainfed conditions. The yield of intercropped wheat was significantly (p < 0.05) increased by 35% on average over two years, resulting not only from the first border rows but also from the second border rows. The yield improvement in the first border rows relative to sole wheat was attributed to the increase of ear number (56%, p < 0.05), kernel number per ear (14%, p < 0.05) and thousand kernel weight (12%, p < 0.05), but the yield improvement in the second border rows was only attributed to the ear number (22%, p < 0.05). The yield of intercropped maize was not significantly (p > 0.05) decreased (6%), mainly attributed to the border rows (19% lower than in sole maize), in which the kernel number per cob and thousand kernel weight were 14% and 8% (p < 0.05) lower than that in sole maize. This was because that the SPAD and photosynthetic rate of maize in intercropping was suppressed during the co-growth period (about 62 days). Although the two had a partly growth recovery after wheat harvest, the growth recovery was not complete, and this was responsible for the reduction of maize yield in intercropping. This study demonstrates that the importance of yield components and the photosynthesis basis for yield advantage in intercropping systems, and reducing the adverse effect of dominate crop on subordinate crops could better exert the advantages of intercropping.

Ingestion of phosphorus for several days has been reported to increase cardiac capacity, improve oxygen muscle kinetics and enhance lactate buffering capacity. Recent studies have shown that phosphorus ingestion with a meal increases postprandial glucose uptake and thermogenesis. The present study aimed to assess the effect of acute phosphorus ingestion with a meal on specific workload parameters. Methods A double-blind, crossover trial of 12 male water polo players between 18 and 22 years old was conducted. Overnight fasted subjects were asked to cycle for 20 min before ingesting 100 g of glucose with phosphorus or placebo (400 mg). Three hours later, they were asked to perform a graded cycling exercise for 25 min. Results Expenditure, respiratory quotient, perception of fatigue and exercise efficiency were similar between treatments. However, heart rate was significantly higher in the phosphorus group (142 +/- 10 beats/min) compared with placebo (135 +/- 10 beats/min). Conclusion Exercise performance 3 hours after the coingestion of glucose with phosphorus did not affect substrate use, while heart rate was increased. The heart rate increase could be attributed to a rise in core body temperature. Trial registration number NCT03101215.

EFFECTS OF NITROGEN APPLICATION RATE UNDER DIFFERENT GROWING SEASON PRECIPITATION LEVELS ON WATER AND NITROGEN UTILIZATION EFFICIENCIES, GRAIN YIELD, AND QUALITY IN DRYLAND WHEAT (TRITICUM AESTIVUM L.)	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												High interannual variability of precipitation and unbalanced N application rate has a considerable impact on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production in the drylands of the Loess Plateau, China. In this study, we conducted field experiments in Wenxi County, Shanxi Province, under six N application rates (0, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 210 kg ha-1) for three consecutive years from 2014 to 2017. The years were classified as the wet (2014-2015), dry (2015-2016), and normal growing seasons (2016-2017) based on total precipitation during the growth period. The results showed that in the wet growing season, the optimum N application rate was 180 kg ha-1, improved the total water consumption during the growth period by 1.9%-13.8%, the spike number by 0.6%-10.9%, the yield by 2.8%-14.3%, N recovery efficiency (NRE) by 15.2%-47.0%, and the economic by 4.4%-21.1%. In the normal and dry growing seasons, the optimum N application rate was 150 kg ha-1, the total water consumption increased during the growth period by 0.5%-16.3%, the spike number by 0.9%-19.8%, the yield by 0.3%-23.3%, water use efficiency by 2.5%- 12.9%, and NRE by 12.9%-59.1%, the economic improved by 0.6%-74.7%.

J	Gooden, J; Pritzlaff, R				Gooden, Jennifer; Pritzlaff, Richard			Dryland Watershed Restoration With Rock Detention Structures: A Nature-based Solution to Mitigate Drought, Erosion, Flooding, and Atmospheric Carbon	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Historic land degradation is an ongoing threat to the Sky Islands of southern Arizona, US, and northern Sonora, Mexico, an area designated as a globally significant biodiversity hotspot. Land degradation has reduced ecosystem services provisioning, released carbon from disturbed soils into the atmosphere, and significantly diminished resilience to climate change. Private land managers in the region have developed methods to reverse degradation and restore biodiversity and ecosystem function. Land managers have used rock detention structures (RDS), technology adapted from traditional Indigenous practices in the region, as a tool for reversing desertification and watershed degradation. The structures were installed primarily for erosion control and water management, but they have had positive impacts on multiple biophysical systems. In this study, we analyze watershed-scale installation of RDS as a nature-based solution for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Case studies include four properties that offer examples of structures that have been in place over a period ranging from 1 to 40 years. We reviewed journal articles and other studies conducted at the four sites, supplemented with interviews, to catalogue the nature-based solutions provided by RDS. This study documents positive impacts on overall stream flow, reduction in peak runoff during inundation events, and increased sedimentation, which increase resilience to drought, erosion, and flooding. Data suggest potential impacts for climate change mitigation, though further research is needed. In addition, results suggest that watershed restoration with RDS offers a host of co-benefits, including an increase in biodiversity and wildlife abundance, an increase in vegetative cover, and increased surface water provisioning over time to support the land-based livelihoods of downstream neighbors. In the discussion, we consider barriers to replication and scalability using the strategy of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration as a guiding framework, discussing issues of awareness, legislation and policy, technical capacity, finance, and gaps in knowledge.

Different kinds of animal manure combined with straw (AM-S) may have varying effects on the decomposition, nutrient release, and structural changes of maize straw. Using the Humic Cambisols soil as the experimental area, the straw decomposition characteristics under the co-application of animal manure were studied following the nylon net bag landfill method. The experiment involved four treatments: maize straw only (S), maize straw plus ox manure (SO), maize straw plus chicken manure (SC), and maize straw plus pig manure (SP). The treatments with AM-S accelerated the decomposition of straw and increased the release rate of nutrients and organic components (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin). During the 240 days of the study, straw decomposition showed a trend of increasing rapidly in the first stages and then increasing slowly in the latter stages in all the treatments. At 240 d, the straw decomposition rates and carbon release rates of the AM-S treatments were 65.25-71.87% and 64.04-69.35%, respectively. At the end of the experiment, the order for the final release rates of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) was K (93.25-96.56%) > P (42.25-55.08%) > N (40.01-52.23%). Moreover, scanning electron microscopy showed that SP treatment had the highest degree of structural changes of the maize straw compared with the other treatments. The purpose of this study was to screen the effective animal manure that can promote straw decomposition and provide a reference for the rational use of straw and animal manure management. In conclusion, the study suggested that the co-application of animal manure and straw should be adopted in agricultural systems, especially SP treatment, as it was more conducive to promoting the decomposition of maize straw and the release of nutrients.																				2071-1050				JUL	2021	13	14							7609	10.3390/su13147609	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13147609													WOS:000677044200001

In this study, changes in soil stability and water-holding capacity characteristics were measured under different tillage cultivations from a multi-year microscopic perspective and analyzed to evaluate selected key indicators. Continuous monitoring of rainfall utilization efficiency and yield was carried out for five years. Here, we discuss the role of conservation tillage in buffering and stabilizing rainfall precipitation pattern on the fluctuation and uncertainty of soil water retention and water supply capacity and soil quality. The study was carried out on dryland areas of the Loess Plateau in northern China with eight tillage systems established in 2016: no-tillage (NT); no-tillage and straw (NTS); subsoiling (SU); subsoiling and straw (SUS); rotary tillage (RT); rotary tillage and straw (RTS); conventional tillage (CT); and conventional tillage and straw (CTS). All treatments were applied in conjunction with continuous cropping for five years. The evaluated soil parameters were mean weight diameter (MWD), geometric mean diameter (GMD), >0.25 mm aggregate content (R-0.25) of water-stable aggregates (WSAs), soil moisture characteristic curve (SMCC), specific soil water capacity (C-theta), soil organic matter (SOM), rainfall utilization efficiency (RUE), and maize yields for five consecutive years. The MWD, GMD, and R-0.25 of SUS were 27.38%, 17.57%, and 7.68% more than CTS (control), respectively. Overall, SOM, average annual RUE, and average annual yields increased by 14.64%, 11.89%, and 9.59%, respectively, compared with 2016. Our results strongly suggest that conservation tillage can considerably improve these characterization indicators. SUS was more effective than CTS in the 0-40 cm soil layer at hedging against drought in the area, stabilizing crop production, and achieving sustainable agricultural development.																			1932-6203					MAR 6	2023	18	3							e0282359	10.1371/journal.pone.0282359	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0282359								36877719					WOS:000945977800019

Responses of Biocrust and Associated Soil Bacteria to Novel Climates Are Not Tightly Coupled	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Climate change is expanding drylands even as land use practices degrade them. Representing similar to 40% of Earth's terrestrial surface, drylands rely on biological soil crusts (biocrusts) for key ecosystem functions including soil stability, biogeochemical cycling, and water capture. Understanding how biocrusts adapt to climate change is critical to understanding how dryland ecosystems will function with altered climate. We investigated the sensitivity of biocrusts to experimentally imposed novel climates to track changes in productivity and stability under both warming and cooling scenarios. We established three common gardens along an elevational-climate gradient on the Colorado Plateau. Mature biocrusts were collected from each site and reciprocally transplanted intact. Over 20 months we monitored visible species composition and cover, chlorophyll a, and the composition of soil bacterial communities using high throughput sequencing. We hypothesized that biocrusts replanted at their home site would show local preference, and biocrusts transplanted to novel environments would maintain higher cover and stability at elevations higher than their origin, compared to at elevations lower than their origin. We expected responses of the visible biocrust cover and soil bacterial components of the biocrust community to be coupled, with later successional taxa showing higher sensitivity to novel environments. Only high elevation sourced biocrusts maintained higher biocrust cover and community stability at their site of origin. Biocrusts from all sources had higher cover and stability in the high elevation garden. Later successional taxa decreased cover in low elevation gardens, suggesting successional reversal with warming. Visible community composition was influenced by both source and transplant environment. In contrast, soil bacterial community composition was not influenced by transplant environments but retained fidelity to the source. Thus, responses of the visible and soil bacterial components of the biocrust community were not coupled. Synthesis: Our results suggest biocrust communities are sensitive to climate change, and loss of species and function can be expected, while associated soil bacteria may be buffered against rapid change.

These ecosystems are subject to climate extremes (e.g. large-scale droughts and extreme floods) that are projected to increase in frequency and severity under most future climate scenarios. In this modelling study we assessed the impact of single years of extreme (high or low) rainfall on dryland vegetation in the Sahel. The magnitude and legacy of these impacts were quantified on both the plant functional type and the ecosystem levels. In order to understand the impact of differences in the rainfall distribution over the year, these rainfall anomalies were driven by changing either rainfall intensity, event frequency or rainy-season length. The Lund-Potsdam-Jena General Ecosystem Simulator (LPJ-GUESS) dynamic vegetation model was parameterized to represent dryland plant functional types (PFTs) and was validated against flux tower measurements across the Sahel. Different scenarios of extreme rainfall were derived from existing Sahel rainfall products and applied during a single year of the model simulation timeline. Herbaceous vegetation responded immediately to the different scenarios, while woody vegetation had a weaker and slower response, integrating precipitation changes over a longer timeframe. An increased season length had a larger impact than increased intensity or frequency, while impacts of decreased rainfall scenarios were strong and independent of the season characteristics. Soil control on surface water balance explains these contrasts between the scenarios. None of the applied disturbances caused a permanent vegetation shift in the simulations. Dryland ecosystems are known to play a dominant role in the trend and variability of the global terrestrial CO2 sink. We showed that single extremely dry and wet years can have a strong impact on the productivity of drylands ecosystems, which typically lasts an order of magnitude longer than the duration of the disturbance. Therefore, this study sheds new light on potential drivers and mechanisms behind this variability.

Temporal Soil Bacterial Community Responses to Cropping Systems and Crop Identity in Dryland Agroecosystems of the Northern Great Plains	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS												Industrialized agriculture results in simplified landscapes where many of the regulatory ecosystem functions driven by soil biological and physicochemical characteristics have been hampered or replaced with intensive, synthetic inputs. To restore long-term agricultural sustainability and soil health, soil should function as both a resource and a complex ecosystem. In this study, we examined how cropping systems impact soil bacterial community diversity and composition, important indicators of soil ecosystem health. Soils from a representative cropping system in the semi-arid Northern Great Plains were collected in June and August of 2017 from the final phase of a 5-year crop rotation managed either with chemical inputs and no-tillage, as a USDA-certified organic tillage system, or as a USDA-certified organic sheep grazing system with reduced tillage intensity. DNA was extracted and sequenced for bacteria community analysis via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Bacterial richness and diversity decreased in all farming systems from June to August and was lowest in the chemical no-tillage system, while evenness increased over the sampling period. Crop species identity did not affect bacterial richness, diversity, or evenness. Conventional no-till, organic tilled, and organic grazed management systems resulted in dissimilar microbial communities. Overall, cropping systems and seasonal changes had a greater effect on microbial community structure and diversity than crop identity. Future research should assess how the rhizobiome responds to the specific phases of a crop rotation, as differences in bulk soil microbial communities by crop identity were not detectable.																				2571-581X				MAR 26	2021	5								624242	10.3389/fsufs.2021.624242	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2021.624242													WOS:000638180700001

Tracing Low-CO<sub>2</sub> Fluxes in Soil Incubation and <SUP>13</SUP>C Labeling Experiments: A Simplified Gas Sampling System for Respiration and Photosynthesis Measurements	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Quantifying carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes between soil and atmosphere is key in understanding net ecosystem C exchange and biogeochemical C cycling in plant-soil systems. In ecosystems with low primary production and sparse vegetation, for example, dry lands or subpolar regions where C fluxes are small, measurement sensitivity is key-even so when measurements are combined with isotopic labeling. Here, we present a simplified gas sampling system developed to facilitate sampling and measurement of low soil CO2 fluxes as well as in situ (CO2)-C-13 labeling in the same setup. The capacity of the system was tested in a set of feature tests along with gas measurements of dryland soil-biocrust systems. The system's sensitivity to capture minor changes in CO2 concentration was confirmed in respiration and photosynthesis measurements of soil-biocrust systems, where fluxes down to 0.1 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) were quantified. A balloon, implemented to counterbalance underpressure build-up during gas withdrawal, mitigated 72% of pressure differences at sampling. The overall system volume was reduced to a minimum to limit contamination caused by residual air, and the design enabled one-step flushing and evacuation of system compartments and gas sample bags, successfully ruling out cross-contamination between samples. Ultimately, this system offers a flexible and accessible solution for CO2 measurements that can be applied not only on arid soils with low biological activity and turnover rates, but also on plant-soil systems. The modifications enabled larger, and thereby more representative, sample volumes to be collected while limiting incubation, contamination, and pressure effects on the intact soil system. Plain Language Summary Measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes between soil and atmosphere are crucial to understand the terrestrial carbon cycle. In dry regions, these fluxes are rather small as both the release of CO2 via microbial respiration and uptake of CO2 via photosynthesis is limited by lack of water and sparse vegetation cover. We have developed a simplified CO2 gas sampling setup suitable for incubation experiments of soils with low biological activity and turnover rates, for example, soils from dry lands or subpolar regions, using only cost-effective, easily available and replaceable system compartments. We tested system parameters in a set of feature tests and could rule out leakage and cross-contamination. We further confirmed the suitability of the system for capturing small CO2 fluxes in photosynthesis and respiration measurements of soils with biocrusts. A balloon was installed to counterbalance pressure build-up during sampling, allowing for larger gas volumes to be collected, which resulted in a mitigation of 72% of the underpressure build-up. This system offers a straightforward and accessible solution for CO2 measurements, with features limiting contamination and pressure effects on the research sample.

Based on eight flux sites within the North China Plain (NCP) and the surrounding area, which were integrated together for the first time, we applied support vector regression method to develop ET dataset for the cropland in NCP from 1982 to 2015 with 1/12 degrees spatial resolution and eight-day temporal interval. The mean annual ET over cropland within NCP was 575 mm yr(-1) with a non-significant increasing trend. In wheat season, the seasonal ET increased significantly at the rate of 1.28 mm yr(-2) with a mean value of 238 mm yr(-1); in maize season, the mean value of seasonal ET was 221 mm yr(-1) with a decreasing trend of -0.95 mm yr(-2). The comparatively high mean annual ET values occurred primarily in the well irrigated area near the Taihang Mountains, irrigation districts along the Yellow River and the humid region. The attribution analysis which combined multiple regression with the first difference method revealed that human activities dominated ET trend at annual scale as well as in wheat season, with relative contributions of 52% and 56%, respectively. While in maize season, ET trend was mostly controlled by climate change with relative contribution of 77%. Among the climate factors, in wheat season, the significantly increasing air temperature was the principal climatic cause of ET increase which was partly offset by the significantly decreasing wind speed; while in maize season, the significant ET decline was primarily resulted from the significantly decreasing net radiation and wind speed. Compared with our ET dataset, the four widely used global or national ET datasets significantly underestimated ET in wheat season, especially in the extensively irrigated areas, suggesting that local observations are crucial for regional studies.

Most studies have focused on large spatial scales, ranging from watersheds to landscapes. Recent studies from the Israeli drylands indicate that shrubs and trees growing in lowgeodiversity sites experience mass mortality following longterm droughts, whilst those in high-geodiversity sites demonstrate high durability. Our objective was to review the relevance of small-scale geodiversity to the slow onset effects of climate change defined by the UN-FCCC, including land and forest degradation, biodiversity loss, and desertification. We propose that patch-scale to hillslope-scale geodiversity alleviate these effects. Also, we demonstrate: (1) how geodiversity coincides with the concepts of biodiversity hotspots, ecological niches, and climatic refugia, and (2) how human-restored geodiversity may be beneficial in conservation projects.

Our objectives were to evaluate N dynamics following different cover crops (legume, nonlegume, none) and their relationship with subsequent corn yields within an established no-till winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-cover crop/corn-soybean (Glycine max) rotation over two site-years in the U.S. Northern Plains. Spring cover crop biomass and N uptake, in-situ soil N mineralization following cover crop termination, and corn grain yield and N uptake were measured. Legume cover crops were associated with higher corn yields, whereas rye (Secale cereale) did not significantly decrease corn yields despite N immobilization by a large rye cover crop in one year. Legume cover crops produced the highest rates of N mineralization during periods of high N demand by corn (V6-R3) and the highest seasonal amounts of mineralized N compared with rye or no cover crops. In-situ N mineralization measurements better predicted yields across all treatments compared with approaches using cover crop biomass and N content. In situ N mineralization rates during corn growth stages V6-R3 provided a superior prediction (r = .83) of corn yields compared with all seasonal estimates of N provided by cover crops. Lower apparent N use efficiency calculated with contributions of in-season N mineralization indicated that less fertilizer N can be applied in the growing season following legume cover crops.

Corruption and conflicts as barriers to adaptive governance: Water governance in dryland systems in the Rio del Carmen watershed	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Water governance in the Rio del Carmen watershed has failed to achieve sustainable water use, generating social conflicts, water overexploitation, and grassland loss. This leaves it unable to adapt and learn, to reconcile different stakeholder perspectives and to adequately respond to uncertainty. Adaptive water governance regulates water access through flexible, inclusive and innovative institutions, increasing system adaptive capacity in the face of uncertainty. This is necessary forwater-scarce systems since they suffer context-specific exposure to land degradation and climate change. This research focuses on how water governance regulates water access in the Rio del Carmen watershed, Mexico, identifying key legal and institutional features that could increase adaptation and secure water resources in the long-term. 27 semi-structured interviews were conducted with key stakeholders in the watershed, in order to understand the water governance structure and its system dynamics. It was found that water mismanagement, overexploitation, and conflicts over access to water are due to the lack of application and neglect of formal rules. Results indicate that breaches of the legal framework are commonplace, permitted by corruption of both former and current government officials. Many farmers have institutionalized this corruption in order to access water; increasing social conflicts and hindering any type of planning or water management, which, in turn, continues to affect the ecological conditions of the watershed. By understanding the governance system, its structure and the interactions that weaken and bypass formal institutions to the detriment of water resources, stakeholder engagement has emerged as an entry point for enabling collaboration and acceptance of formal institutions. This process has the potential to create a formal network, as a Watershed Committee, that could be honoured in practice through the efficacy of this engagement. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

J	Gedefaw, AA				Gedefaw, Abebaw Andarge			Analysis of the Contribution of Land Registration to Sustainable Land Management in East Gojjam Zone, Ethiopia	LAND												Land registration programs on a large scale aimed at strengthening the land rights of farm households in Ethiopia have been executed in different degrees across different regions since 1998. This study investigates the contribution of land registration on the perceived tenure security of farmers, farmer confidence, women and marginalized groups, and sustainable land-management practice after receiving a land holding certificate in the dryland areas of East Gojjam Zone, Ethiopia. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 385 households selected by using stratified random sampling techniques. Furthermore, focus group discussions and key informants are primary data sources. According to an investigation of qualitative and quantitative data, 163 households have a mean of 0.40 ha of agricultural land on steep slope areas, and approximately 26% of households are afraid of land redistribution and farm loss in the next five years. Moreover, 22% of households fear the government taking their farm plot at any time. Respondents, on the other hand, believe that land registration has reduced the landlessness of women, the disabled, and the poorest of the poor while increasing the landlessness of youths. After land registration, household participation in land-management practices increased by 15%. Despite this, the difference in the mean of major crop yields per household is insignificant, except for wheat, which decreased significantly at the p < 0.1 level. The study determined household head age, household size, land management training and advice, livestock holdings, and the mean distance from farm to settlement as influential factors for increasing construction of water-harvesting systems. Land registration, in general, enhances land tenure security, land-management practice, and land rights of women and marginalized groups of societies, but did not improve crop productivity. The findings should persuade policymakers to address potential sources of insecurity, such as future land redistribution issues.																				2073-445X				JUN	2023	12	6							1157	10.3390/land12061157	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land12061157													WOS:001014624700001

(Nitrariaceae) subjected to heavy metals: implications for the use in polluted dryland restoration	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Phytoremediation is an effective and low-cost technique for the rehabilitation and cleanup of lands polluted with heavy metals. Selection of native plant species could avoid the ecological risks that are associated with the usage of non-native species. However, utilizing native species in phytoremediation and restoration of lands polluted by heavy metals requires information about their seed germinability and propagation requirements. The aim of this work was to assess the effects of four heavy metals (cadmium, chromium, lead and zinc) on the germination and early seedling growth of Peganum harmala L., a native Mediterranean species that has the potential to restore arid degraded lands. The results display that the germination characteristics (percent seed germination and Timson's index) and growth parameters (hypocotyl and radicle lengths) worsened as the concentrations of all the heavy metals increased. Cadmium was found to be the most toxic element regarding these parameters, with toxicity decreasing in the following pattern: Cd > Pb > Cr > Zn. Radicle growth was more affected by the heavy metals compared to hypocotyl growth and the seedlings appeared to be more resistant to Zn. The germination ability of P. harmala over a wide range of heavy metals suggests that this species can grow easily in polluted soils.

The objectives of this study were to estimate the current fractional cover gradient of invasive trees of the genus Prosopis in the Afar Region, Ethiopia, and to identify drivers of its invasion. We used seventeen explanatory variables describing Landsat 8 image reflectance, topography, climate and landscape structures to model the current cover of Prosopis across the invaded range using the random forest (RF) algorithm. Validation of the RF algorithm confirmed high model performance with an accuracy of 92% and a Kappa-coefficient of 0.8. We found that, within 35 years after its introduction, Prosopis has invaded approximately 1.17 million ha at different cover levels in the Afar Region (12.3% of the surface). Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and elevation showed the highest explanatory power among the 17 variables, in terms of both the invader's overall distribution as well as areas with high cover. Villages and linear landscape structures (rivers and roads) were found to be more important drivers of future Prosopis invasion than environmental variables, such as climate and topography, suggesting that Prosopis is likely to continue spreading and increasing in abundance in the case study area if left uncontrolled. We discuss how information on the fractional cover and the drivers of invasion can help in developing spatially-explicit management recommendations against a target invasive plant species.

Soil texture and precipitation seasonality influence plant community structure in North American temperate shrub steppe	ECOLOGY												In drylands, the coexistence of grasses and woody plants has been attributed to soil-water resource partitioning. Soil texture and precipitation seasonality can influence the amount and distribution of water in the soil, and their interaction may play an important role in determining the relative importance of grasses and woody plants. We investigated the influence of this interaction on plant functional types across a broad range of precipitation regimes and soil textures in western North America by analyzing plant-cover data collected at 2,084 plots that included the widespread shrub big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.). We characterized how the significance of the inverse-texture effect varies across soil conditions by quantifying relationships between precipitation and foliar cover on finer- vs. coarser-textured soils across a range of potential texture divisions represented by sand content. We found evidence of the inverse-texture effect for every plant functional type (except for cheatgrass) that we examined with at least one component of precipitation (annual, warm, or cold season), and provide the first evidence for this effect in locations with cold-season-dominated precipitation regimes. The texture and precipitation combinations that exhibited the inverse-texture effect varied with plant functional type, presumably because of effects of soil texture on water availability at different soil depths with season. Furthermore, we found an inverse-texture effect that was remarkably similar for shrub cover with cold-season precipitation and grass cover with warm-season precipitation. These results provide new insight into how the inverse-texture effect interacts with precipitation seasonality to influence plant functional type composition in drylands, and further suggest that quantifying the soil-texture division at which the inverse-texture effect is relevant under a given set of environmental conditions may provide support for the effect across dryland plant communities.

Dead again: predictions of repeat tree die-off under hotter droughts confirm mortality thresholds for a dryland conifer species	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Tree die-off, driven by extreme drought and exacerbated by a warming climate, is occurring rapidly across every wooded continent-threatening carbon sinks and other ecosystem services provided by forests and woodlands. Forecasting the spatial patterns of tree die-off in response to drought is a priority for the management and conservation of forested ecosystems under projected future hotter and drier climates. Several thresholds derived from drought-metrics have been proposed to predict mortality of Pinus edulis, a model tree species in many studies of drought-induced tree die-off. To improve future capacity to forecast tree mortality, we used a severe drought as a natural experiment. We compared the ability of existing mortality thresholds derived from four drought metrics (the Forest Drought Severity Index (FDSI), the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, and raw values of precipitation (PPT) and vapor pressure deficit, calculated using 4 km PRISM data) to predict areas of P. edulis die-off following an extreme drought in 2018 across the southwestern US. Using aerial detection surveys of tree mortality in combination with gridded climate data, we calculated the agreement between these four proposed thresholds and the presence and absence of regional-scale tree die-off using sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC). Overall, existing mortality thresholds tended to over predict the spatial extent of tree die-off across the landscape, yet some retain moderate skill in discriminating between areas that experienced and did not experience tree die-off. The simple PPT threshold had the highest AUC score (71%) as well as fair sensitivity and specificity, but the FDSI had the greatest sensitivity to die-off (85.9%). We highlight that empirically derived climate thresholds may be useful forecasting tools to identify vulnerable areas to drought induced die-off, allowing for targeted responses to future droughts and improved management of at-risk areas.

Based on the Climate Change Initiative Land Cover dataset (CCILC), in this study, four indicators of land cover change (LCC) were calculated, i.e., regional change intensity (RCI), rate of change in land cover (CR), evolutionary direction index (EDI), and artificial change percentage (ACP), to progressively derive the intensity, rate, evolutionary direction, and anthropogenic interferences of global arid ecosystems. The LCC from 1992 to 2020 and from 28 consecutive pair-years was observed at the global, continental, and country scales to examine spatiotemporal evolution in the Earth's arid ecosystems. The following main results were obtained: (1) Global arid ecosystems experienced positive evolution despite complex LCCs and anthropogenic interferences. Cautious steps to avoid potential issues caused by rapid urbanization and farmland expansion are necessary. (2) The arid ecosystems in Australia, Central Asia, and southeastern Africa generally improved, as indicated by EDI values, but those in North America were degraded, with 41.1% of LCCs associated with urbanization or farming. The arid ecosystems in South America also deteriorated, but 83.4% of LCCs were in natural land covers. The arid ecosystems in Europe slightly improved with overall equivalent changes in natural and artificial land covers. (3) Global arid ecosystems experienced three phases of change based on RCI values: 'intense' (1992-1998), 'stable' (1998-2014), and 'intense' (2014-2020). In addition, two phases of evolution based on EDI values were observed: 'deterioration' (1992-2002) and 'improvement' (2002-2020). The ACP values indicated that urbanization and farming activities contributed increasingly less to global dryland change since 1992. These findings provide critical insights into the evolution of global arid ecosystems based on analyses of LCCs and will be beneficial for sustainable development of arid ecosystems worldwide within the context of ongoing climate change.

Soil bacterial community response to cover crops, cover crop termination, and predicted climate conditions in a dryland cropping system	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS												Soil microbial communities are integral to highly complex soil environments, responding to changes in aboveground plant biodiversity, influencing physical soil structure, driving nutrient cycling, and promoting both plant growth and disease suppression. Cover crops can improve soil health, but little is known about their effects on soil microbial community composition in semiarid cropping systems, which are rapidly becoming warmer and drier due to climate change. This study focused on a wheat-cover crop rotation near Havre, Montana that tested two cover crop mixtures (five species planted early season and seven species planted mid-season) with three different termination methods (chemical, grazed, or hayed and baled) against a fallow control under ambient or induced warmer/drier conditions. Soil samples from the 2018 and 2019 cover crop/fallow phases were collected for bacterial community 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The presence and composition of cover crops affected evenness and community composition. Bacterial communities in the 2018 ambient mid-season cover crops, warmer/drier mid-season cover crops, and ambient early season cover crops had greater richness and diversity than those in the warmer/drier early season cover crops. Soil microbial communities from mid-season cover crops were distinct from the early season cover crops and fallow. No treatments affected bacterial alpha or beta diversity in 2019, which could be attributed to high rainfall. Results indicate that cover crop mixtures including species tolerant to warmer and drier conditions can foster diverse soil bacterial communities compared to fallow soils.																				2571-581X				OCT 13	2022	6								911199	10.3389/fsufs.2022.911199	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2022.911199													WOS:000875827300001

Evaluation of WRF Cumulus Parameterization Schemes for the Hot Climate of Sudan Emphasizing Crop Growing Seasons	ATMOSPHERE												High spatiotemporal resolution climate data are essential for climate-related impact studies. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is widely used to downscale climate data for different regions with regional-specific physics configurations. This study aimed to identify robust configurations of the WRF model, especially cumulus parameterization schemes, for different climatic zones of Sudan. We focused on wet season (June-September) rainfall and dry season (November-February) temperature, which are determinants of summer crop and irrigated wheat yields, respectively. Downscaling experiments were carried out to compare the following schemes: Betts-Miller-Janjic (BMJ), improved Kain-Fritch (KFT), modified Tiedtke (TDK), and Grell-Freitas (GF). Results revealed that the BMJ performed better for wet season rainfall in the hyper-arid and arid zones; KFT performed better for rainfall in July and August in the semi-arid zone where most summer crops are cultivated. For dry season temperature, the BMJ and TDK outperformed the other schemes in all three zones, except that the GF performed best for the minimum temperature in December and January in the arid zone, where irrigated wheat is produced, and in the semi-arid zone. Specific parameterization schemes therefore need to be selected for specific seasons and climatic zones of Sudan.

Salting the Earth: Intentional Application of Common Salt to Australian Farmland during the Nineteenth Century	HERITAGE												During the nineteenth century, common salt (NaCl) was liberally applied to Australian farmland as a manure to improve productivity and as a fungicide to prevent, or at least reduce, the impact of rust in wheat. In an age where salinity control is paramount for biodiversity and agricultural productivity alike, it is worth reflecting that during the nineteenth century salt was intentionally applied as a manure to improve soil productivity.

This study was conducted in an arid zone agricultural region to investigate the impacts of biochar on soil quality, N-2-fixation, and net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) for a legume-cereal crop rotation (2013-15). Biochar was produced by pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse and applied at rates of 0%, 0.25%, and 0.5% carbon (C) equivalent, with and without chemical fertilizer (23 kg N, 45 kg P and 25 kg K ha(-1)). In terms of soil quality, biochar applications increased soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and decreased soil bulk density. The yield of mash bean and wheat crop was significantly enhanced in response to biochar treatment with and without chemical fertilizer during both the years of study. N-2-fixation in mash bean increased by 83% in biochar-only (0.5% C) amended soil and by 127% with chemical fertilizer. In the first year of mash bean, no difference was observed in NEE, while a significant decrease was observed in the second year attributed to priming effect of fresh biochar. Wheat NEE decreased by 144% and 200% in the first year, and by 283% and 265% in the second year, in unfertilized soil amended with 0.25 and 0.5% biochar, respectively, as compared to the controls. In treatments with chemical fertilizer, wheat NEE decreased by 311% and 344% in the first year, and by 293% and 292% in the second year, as compared to their respective controls. Biochar treatment increased biomass yield (BY) and grain yield (GY) in both mash bean and wheat crops during both the years with and without chemical fertilizer. These results indicate that sugarcane -bagasse biochar applications in arid soils with low organic carbon may increase crop productivity and N-2-fixation of legumes while reducing the NEE of legume-cereal cropping systems.

In semi-arid environments, climatic conditions and poor agricultural management have a strong impact on plant yield and thus, enhancing soil fertility by means of beneficial microorganisms such as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) has been proposed as part of sustainable agricultural management. As drylands will increase due to climate change, studying microbial community dynamics of crops under such conditions is crucial as it might favor rhizobacteria adapted to drought. While the microbiome of many native dryland crops has been characterized, the microbial community composition from non-native crops under semi-arid environmental conditions is understudied. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize the bacterial community associated with the roots of three crops with different growth cycles, cultivated in the same semi-arid environment, to understand their microbial community composition during the season with the highest temperature in northeast Mexico. We performed high throughput sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene from root samples of Pequin pepper, soybean and orange trees. Classified taxa were evaluated according to crop, sampling time and climatological parameters. Our findings revealed that changes in temporal dynamics of microbial communities correlate with environmental temperature. Moreover, the microbial community of pepper was more diverse and differed from that of soybean and orange. Regarding PGPR, 47.6% of the genera were shared among crops with a high relative abundance of Bacillus, but we also detected crop-specific microbial associations where Serratia was specific to orange trees and Rhodobacter to pepper. When analyzing PGPR in correlation to climatological parameters, Bacillus was found to thrive under lower precipitation rates, higher temperatures and higher evaporation rates in pepper and orange. In contrast, some PGPR commonly used in commercial biofertilizers such as Rhizobium and Azospirillum were affected by high temperatures. This study provides a better understanding of the rhizobacterial assemblies of economically relevant crops grown under a semi-arid environment.

How can ecosystem engineer plants boost productivity in east Mediterranean drylands	ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES												BackgroundWater availability is the key limiting factor for plant productivity in drylands covering ca. 40% of Earth's land surface. For such ecosystems to retain productivity and biodiversity under climatic change, it would be valuable to identify/promote keystone plant species that (i) have developed strategies to more efficiently utilize moisture resources not easily accessible and (ii) improve moisture conditions for neighboring plants. The very deep-rooted Ziziphus lotus, considered an ecosystem engineer, is one such example. However, it is not known which biotic traits: (a) canopy interception of moisture/rainfall, (b) hydraulic redistribution of deep ground moisture by roots, or non-biotic factors: (c) soil's volume, and (d) organic matter content, Z. lotus activates/modulates to play such a role. We, thus, selected dryland ecosystems where the plant dominates and measured for potential effects on the less deep-rooted Thymbra capitata. For assessing impacts on ecosystem productivity, we measured the spatial aggregation of ca. 3600 T. capitata plants. As a proxy for soil moisture availability and its spatial variability, we conducted a 7-year-long study using thymes' nighttime rehydration. Sampling extended up to 15 m away from Z. lotus.ResultsThe density of T. capitata plants growing up to 5 m around Z. lotus vs. thymes growing 10-15 m away was found significantly increased (2.5-4.5 times), while their stem/leaf moisture was ca. 10% higher at predawn compared to nightfall during the dry season. This suggests that ecosystem productivity is driven by a greater soil moisture availability around Z. lotus permitting more thyme daytime transpiration, in contrast to thymes growing further away. The phenomenon appeared only under dry topsoil (during the dry season; becoming stronger during dry years). Morning dew/rainfall interception from the canopy or soil depth/organic matter did not show significant effects, leaving only the hydraulic lift properties of Z. lotus as the most likely driver for soil moisture availability.ConclusionsThe deep-rooting properties and hydraulic lift potential of Z. lotus may be the key in permitting it to boost ecosystem productivity. Such hydraulic plant traits require more attention as they may prove valuable in combating desertification and restoring ecosystems in arid/semiarid regions threatened by climate change.

While atmospheric and soil drying often co-occur, their differential effects on plant functioning and productivity remain uncertain. We investigated the divergent effects and underlying mechanisms of soil and atmospheric drought based on continuous, in situ measurements of branch gas exchange with automated chambers in a mature semiarid Aleppo pine forest. We investigated the response of control trees exposed to combined soil-atmospheric drought (low SM, high VPD) during the rainless Mediterranean summer and that of trees experimentally unconstrained by soil dryness (high SM; using supplementary dry season water supply) but subjected to atmospheric drought (high VPD). During the seasonal dry period, branch conductance (gbr), transpiration rate (E) and net photosynthesis (Anet) decreased in low-SM trees but greatly increased in high-SM trees. The response of E and gbr to the massive rise in VPD (to 7 kPa) was negative in low-SM trees and positive in high-SM trees. These observations were consistent with predictions based on a simple plant hydraulic model showing the importance of plant water potential in the gbr and E response to VPD. These results demonstrate that avoiding drought on the supply side (SM) and relying on plant hydraulic regulation constrains the effects of atmospheric drought (VPD) as a stressor on canopy gas exchange in mature pine trees under field conditions. Under high evaporative demand conditions, mature Aleppo pine trees demonstrated increased transpiration and photosynthesis in response to supplementary irrigation. Stomatal conductance exhibited hypo-sensitivity to increasing water demand (high vapour pressure deficit) but was sensitive to a decrease in water supply, expressed as soil water content or plant water potential. Our findings highlight that water supply, rather than water demand, is the primary limiting factor for transpiration in Aleppo pine trees.

J	Garba, II; Williams, A				Garba, Ismail Ibrahim; Williams, Alwyn			Datasets supporting the adoption of multifunctional cover crops related to soil water and nitrogen in water-limited environments	DATA IN BRIEF												Crop diversification with cover crops could deliver a wide range of agroecosystem services including water conservation, nutrient cycling, biodiversity, and crop productivity as well as reducing the negative environmental footprint of conventional fallows. However, the potential competition of cover crops and subsequent cash crops on plant available water and soil mineral nitrogen (N) has limited the adoption of cover cropping for fallow replacement in water-limited environments. This article provides datasets for understanding the multifunctional role of cover crops as an alternative paradigm to conventional fallow in water-limited environments. The dataset is divided into four components comprising measured cover crop parameters (21 variables, n = 144), soil water (4 variables, n = 2,159), soil mineral N (4 variables, n = 1440), and site characteristics (8 variables). The datasets consist of crop resource quantity (biomass, N uptake, delta 15 N ( parts per thousand ), fixed shoot N, and water use), resource quality (C/N ratio, lignin, acid detergent fibre, and N concentration), and soil status (plant available water and mineral N) at field scale. The data supports the framework of the continuous development of alternative innovative cropping systems that have the potential to increase and maintain crop yield while minimizing the adverse effects of conventional fallowing in the context of sustainable intensification. The datasets are associated with the original research article published in Agriculture, Ecosystem, and Environment entitled "Fallow replacement cover crops impact soil water and nitrogen dynamics in a semi-arid sub-tropical environment" as Garba et al.

However, an impediment to the adoption of the species on saline land has been the challenges in achieving successful establishment by direct seeding due to a lack of knowledge of the optimal conditions for germination. Therefore, the optimal germination requirements in relation to temperature, salinity level and seed size was assessed for each species to ascertain the optimal conditions for successful establishment by direct seeding on saline land. Seeds of both species showed optimal germination temperature at 10 degrees C. Atriplex nummularia seeds were more tolerant to temperatures above or below 10 degrees C than R. preissii. The germination percentage of A. nummularia was unchanged at 0-200 mM NaCl2. The germination percentage of Rhagodia preissii declined when the NaCl2 content exceeded 50 mM. There was no correlation between seed size, germination and emergence for any of the species. Based on the study, we suggest that sowing operations are performed during the cold winter months in subtropical areas or autumn and spring in temperate areas, to improve the successful establishment of these shrubs by direct seeding.																			1664-462X					OCT 17	2022	13								989562	10.3389/fpls.2022.989562	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.989562								36325563					WOS:000878040100001

Drylands, as one of the most fragile ecosystems, are vulnerable to changes in temperature, precipitation, and drought extremes. However, it is still unclear how plant traits interact with soil properties to regulate drylands' responses to seasonal and interannual climate change. The vegetation sensitivity index (VSI) of desert scrubs in the Qaidam Basin (NE Tibetan Plateau) was assessed by summarizing the relative contributions of temperature (S-GST), precipitation (S-GSP), and drought (temperature vegetation dryness index, S-TVDI) to the dynamics of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) during plant growing months yearly from 2000 to 2015. Nutrient contents, including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in topsoils and leaves of plants, were measured for seven types of desert scrub communities at 22 sites in the summer of 2016. Multiple linear and structural equation models were used to reveal how leaf and soil nutrient regimes affect desert scrubs' sensitivity to climate variability. The results showed that total soil nitrogen (STN) and leaf carbon content (LC), respectively, explained 25.9% and 17.0% of the VSI variance across different scrub communities. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that STN and total soil potassium (STK) mediated desert scrub's VSI indirectly via S-GST (with standardized path strength of -0.35 and +0.32, respectively) while LC indirectly via S-GST and S-GSP (with standardized path strength of -0.31 and -0.19, respectively). Neither soil nor leave nutrient contents alone could explain the VSI variance across different sites, except for the indirect influences of STN and STK via S-TVDI (-0.18 and 0.16, respectively). Overall, this study disentangled the relative importance of plant nutrient traits and soil nutrient availability in mediating the climatic sensitivity of desert scrubs in the Tibetan Plateau. Integrating soil nutrient availability with plant functional traits together is recommended to better understand the mechanisms behind dryland dynamics under global climate change.

In the Loess Plateau, China, it is difficult to find native oak (Quercus liaotungensis) seedlings in non-native black locust forests. Black locust is an arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) tree, but oak is an ectomycorrhizal (ECM) tree. Plants highly depend on their symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi to take up water, nitrogen (N) and other nutrients. We hypothesized that black locust forests would not provide ECM inoculum to oak seedlings, limiting their water and nutrient uptake, which would be improved by ECM inoculum. Here, we (1) sowed seeds, with or without oak forest soils, (2) transplanted seedlings collected in oak forests, with or without oak forest soils, and (3) planted seedlings germinated in autoclaved or unautoclaved oak forest soils. We measured the survival and growth rate for all three experiments, along with chemical properties, and root ECM colonization. Oak seeds sowed with oak forest soils had higher mycorrhizal colonization, leaf N concentrations and survival rate, and lower root delta C-13 than the seeds sowed without oak forest soils. Planting with oak forest soils also increased the survival rate of the germinated seedlings, but not the transplanted seedlings. Overall, our study suggested that the use of oak forest soils in the black locust forest to improve the water and N uptake of oak seedlings by providing the ECM inoculum, resulting in a high survival rate. Our study also implies that the method of sowing seeds was effortless and effectively compared to transplanting wild/nursery seedlings.

Remotely Sensed Fine-Fuel Changes from Wildfire and Prescribed Fire in a Semi-Arid Grassland	FIRE-SWITZERLAND												The spread of flammable invasive grasses, woody plant encroachment, and enhanced aridity have interacted in many grasslands globally to increase wildfire activity and risk to valued assets. Annual variation in the abundance and distribution of fine-fuel present challenges to land managers implementing prescribed burns and mitigating wildfire, although methods to produce high-resolution fuel estimates are still under development. To further understand how prescribed fire and wildfire influence fine-fuels in a semi-arid grassland invaded by non-native perennial grasses, we combined high-resolution Sentinel-2A imagery with in situ vegetation data and machine learning to estimate yearly fine-fuel loads from 2015 to 2020. The resulting model of fine-fuel corresponded to field-based validation measurements taken in the first (R-2 = 0.52, RMSE = 218 kg/ha) and last year (R-2 = 0.63, RMSE = 196 kg/ha) of this 6-year study. Serial prediction of the fine-fuel model allowed for an assessment of the effect of prescribed fire (average reduction of -80 kg/ha 1-year post fire) and wildfire (-260 kg/ha 1-year post fire) on fuel conditions. Post-fire fine-fuel loads were significantly lower than in unburned control areas sampled just outside fire perimeters from 2015 to 2020 across all fires (t = 1.67, p < 0.0001); however, fine-fuel recovery occurred within 3-5 years, depending upon burn and climate conditions. When coupled with detailed fuels data from field measurements, Sentinel-2A imagery provided a means for evaluating grassland fine-fuels at yearly time steps and shows high potential for extended monitoring of dryland fuels. Our approach provides land managers with a systematic analysis of the effects of fire management treatments on fine-fuel conditions and provides an accurate, updateable, and expandable solution for mapping fine-fuels over yearly time steps across drylands throughout the world.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of straw mulching on soil nutrient content and microbial community. The two-year experiment involved six treatments: experiment slopes (3, 6, and 9 degrees, 20 m long) and mulching (i.e. only maize straw (1.65 kg m(-2)) was mulched, and no mulch). Straw mulching treatments increased the levels of soil available nitrogen (AN), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP), and total phosphorus (TP) at three different soil slopes. The AN content for 9 degrees slopes straw mulching (NS) was 69.4% higher than 9 degrees slopes no straw mulching (N), and also enhanced bacterial richness and diversity. The relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes for NS were 48.3% and 76.7% larger than N treatment, respectively. Ascomycota was higher in 6 degrees slopes straw mulching (55.3%) followed by NS (53.5%). In all, our findings showed that the application of straw mulching was a better approach for the restoration of slopy arable land (especially in arable land with high slope) fertility based on enhancing soil nutrient and microbial community.					wang, chen/JED-7289-2023; wu, p/JDW-5015-2023; sheng, chen/JEO-8801-2023; li, bo/JJC-2664-2023; chen, chen/JGD-3057-2023; chen, si/JPK-4258-2023; LIU, HUI/JPX-8014-2023; Jiang, Yuan/JED-3759-2023														0365-0340	1476-3567				NOV 10	2023	69	13					2510	2521		10.1080/03650340.2022.2160976	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2022.2160976		DEC 2022											WOS:000901401400001
J	Walker, S; Harding, MAC; Loh, G				Walker, Susan; Harding, Michael A. C.; Loh, Graeme			The pattern of declines and local extinctions of endemic inland Lepidium species in the eastern South Island	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Small patches of habitat for indigenous species that remain in developed landscapes are predicted to lose species over time as extinction debts are paid off and to become transformed by spillover from intensive land uses. In December 2020 we searched for plants of three inland South Island-endemic species of Lepidium (Brassicaceae; L. kirkii, L. sisymbrioides, and L. solandri) at previously known locations in Central Otago, the Waitaki Valley, the Mackenzie Basin, and Kura Tawhiti (Castle Hill, North Canterbury). We recorded whether Lepidium populations remained and identified the vascular plant flora of each location. Lepidium kirkii was found at six of 14 locations where formerly known and at one new location, but numbered over 50 individuals at only one of these locations. Lepidium sisymbrioides was found at five of six locations visited, but we found fewer than four individuals at three of these locations. L. solandri was found at five of 12 formerly known locations in Central Otago (but numbered over 50 individuals at only one), at five of five formerly known locations on public land in the Mackenzie Basin, and at the one known location at Kura Tawhiti. Exotic vascular plant species outnumbered native species at all but one Lepidium location in Central Otago and at Kura Tawhiti, but not in the Mackenzie Basin, where there had been the least habitat loss and land-use intensification. Our results are consistent with theoretical predictions of more local plant extinctions at Lepidium locations, and greater transformation of their habitats, in landscapes dominated by intensive land uses and non-indigenous vegetation. We conclude that intensive ex situ and in situ management is now needed to avoid global extinctions of L. kirkii and L. sisymbrioides, and local extinctions of L. solandri at remaining Central Otago locations and at Kura Tawhiti. We do not know whether landscape-scale processes still provide for the persistence of L. solandri and other dryland species in the Mackenzie Basin or whether intensive land use has already crossed ecological thresholds.																			0110-6465	1177-7788					2023	47	1							3547	10.20417/nzjecol.47.3547	http://dx.doi.org/10.20417/nzjecol.47.3547													WOS:001107227400002

Copernicia prunifera (Carnauba), a palm tree native to the semi-arid region of Brazil (Caatinga ecosystem), has high economic and social importance, but has been impacted by the invasive climbing shrub Cryptostegia madagascariensis (Madagascar rubber vine). We evaluated physiological, biochemical, and nutritional responses in mature plants of both species in two locations: Catuana (where there is an intense water-deficit during the dry season) and Minguau (where there is high salinity and sodicity, and excess water throughout the year). Our results show that competitive interaction between the two species is mainly defined by their adaptability to abiotic soil constraints. C. prunifera is better adapted to severe water-deficit conditions, but its ecophysiological performance is not sufficient to withstand invasion by C. madagascariensis. The invader is more competitive in flooded, salt-affected soils, and is not severely impacted even with high sodium accumulation in its leaves. Our results also show that the negative impacts on C. prunifera intensify at the final stage of infestation, when the shading caused by C. madagascariensis restricts access to solar radiation and accelerates leaf senescence. However, the impact on C. prunifera precedes the permanent shading, as evidenced by the inhibition of net assimilation of CO2 under intermediate levels of infestation. These results reinforce the vulnerability of carnauba populations in the Caatinga ecosystem, which may be severely impacted without the development of technologies to mitigate the impact of invasion.

In the context of modernization, IAHS have been increasingly challenged. Thus, the heritage sites must explore dynamic conservation approaches and formulate adaptive management strategies. However, few studies have provided either theoretical methods or practical cases as support. In this study, we put forward an analytical framework for IAHS conservation and development measure formulation based on the Driver -Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model and applied it to the Shexian Dryland Stone Terraced System (SDSTS). With this framework, we analyzed the supportive mechanisms for the stable state of the SDSTS, diagnosed the threats and challenges it faces, and then formulated 34 conservation and development measures from six aspects, namely management mechanism construction, ecological conservation, cultural inheritance, green and organic product development, sustainable tourism development, and capacity building. It is demonstrated that the DPSIR-based analytical framework can provide both theoretical and technical support for the formulation of IAHS conservation and development measures, thus having the potential to become a general tool for the dynamic conservation and sustainable development of IAHS.

However, studies designed to assess the effectiveness of tracking changes in diversity using historical satellite imagery are lacking. This study employs open-access multispectral Landsat imagery and the BiodivMapR package to estimate the multi-temporal alpha diversity in drylands affected by mining. Multi-temporal parameters of alpha diversity were identified, such as vegetation indices, buffer zone size, and the number of clusters. Variations in alpha diversity were compared for various plant communities over time. The results showed that this method could effectively assess the alpha diversity of vegetation (R-2, 0.68). The optimal parameters used to maximize the accuracy of alpha diversity were NDVI threshold, 0.01; size of buffer zones, 120 m x 120 m; number of clusters, 100. The root mean square error of the alpha diversity of herbs was lowest (0.26), while those of shrub and tree communities were higher (0.34-0.41). During the period 1990-2020, the study area showed an overall trend of increasing diversity, with surface mining causing a significant decrease in diversity when compared with underground mining. This illustrates that the quick development of remote sensing and image processing techniques offers new opportunities for monitoring diversity in both single and multiple time phases. Researchers should consider the plant community types involved and select locally suitable parameters. In the future, the generation of long-time series and finer resolution maps of diversity should be studied further in the aspects of spatial, functional, taxonomic, and phylogenetic diversity.																				2072-4292				MAR	2023	15	6							1554	10.3390/rs15061554	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15061554													WOS:000958728900001

EFFECTS OF NITROGEN APPLICATION RATE UNDER DIFFERENT GROWING SEASON PRECIPITATION LEVELS ON WATER AND NITROGEN UTILIZATION EFFICIENCIES, GRAIN YIELD, AND QUALITY IN DRYLAND WHEAT (<i>TRITICUM A ESTI VUM L</i>.)	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												High interannual variability of precipitation and unbalanced N application rate has a considerable impact on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production in the drylands of the Loess Plateau, China In this study, we conducted field experiments in Wenxi County, Shanxi Province, under six N application rates (0, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 210 kg ha-1) for three consecutive years from 2014 to 2017. The years were classified as the wet (2014-2015), dry (2015-2016), and normal growing seasons (2016-2017) based on total precipitation during the growth period. The results showed that in the wet growing season, the optimum N application rate was 180 kg ha-1, improved the total water consumption during the growth period by 1.9%-13.8%, the spike number by 0.6%-10.9%, the yield by 2.8%-14.3%, N recovery efficiency (NRE) by 15.2%-47.0%, and the economic by 4.4%-21.1%.

Weeding Frequency Effects on Growth and Yield of Dry Bean Intercropped with Sweet Sorghum and Cowpea under a Dryland Area	SUSTAINABILITY												A better understanding of the dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) growth and yield response to weed competition under the intercropping system is critical for improving sustainable weed management strategies. A two-year trial was conducted with three types of crop arrangement (sole cropping, inter-row, and intra-row intercropping) combined with weeding frequency (no weeding, weeding over the first 50 days of crop growth, and weed-free). Effects of the treatments were tested on dry bean agronomic indicators in terms of the following: 100-grain weight, dry biomass, grain yield, grains per pod, pods per plant, plant height, number of leaves per plant, and chlorophyll content. The intercropping pattern significantly affected dry bean pods per plant, height, and chlorophyll content, while weeding frequency significantly affected all measured agronomic indicators for dry bean, except for chlorophyll content, during the 2017/18 growing season. The results showed that the significant measured agronomic indicators were the lowest under no weed control; however, they increased as weeding frequency increased. The 2018/19 growing season followed a similar trend; however, the interaction effect significantly affected dry bean 100-grain weight, dry biomass, and number of leaves per plant at 40 days after emergence. The dry bean/sweet sorghum or cowpea intra-row intercropping and intermediate weeding frequency displayed optimum productivity.

We have tested a statistically rigorous method for regional land degradation assessment in drylands, using fuzzy classification theory and techniques, that results in the creation of a habitat condition archetype for the Namaqualand Hardeveld bioregion of the Succulent Karoo biome in South Africa. The methodology initially groups field data into classes based on known indicators of land degradation, before predicting observed field cover with 16 remote sensing variables, derived from both LANDSAT 8 and SENTINEL-2A satellite data. Using fuzzy classification techniques, projections of field cover from the resulting model are combined with variables representing a potential change in cover to produce a map of the habitat condition of the bioregion. Approximately 17% of the bioregion had habitat condition values less than one standard deviation smaller than the mean and could therefore be considered degraded. To provide context, this map is presented with potential drivers of change for the bioregion. The map, and accompanying drivers of change, is ultimately presented in a Google Earth Engine app for easy interpretation and use.

J	Hu, YB; Xie, W; Chen, BD				Hu, Yanbo; Xie, Wei; Chen, Baodong			Arbuscular mycorrhiza improved drought tolerance of maize seedlings by altering photosystem II efficiency and the levels of key metabolites	CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN AGRICULTURE												Background: Water shortage can limit plant growth, which can be ameliorated by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis through physiological and metabolic regulations. Deciphering which physiological and metabolic processes are central for AM-mediated regulations is essential for applications of mycorrhizal biotechnology in dryland agriculture. Methodology: In this study, the influence of AM symbiosis on growth performance, photosynthesis, and organ accumulation of key C and N metabolites were assessed by growing maize (Mo17, Lancaster Sure Crop) seedlings inoculated with or without AM fungus (Rhizophagus irregularisSchenck & Smith BGC AH01) under different water regimes in greenhouse. Results: Drought stress reduced shoot growth, while AM symbiosis significantly improved growth performances, with significant changes of photochemical processes and organ concentration of the key metabolites. AM symbiosis increased root levels of the metabolites in ornithine cycle and unsaturation of fatty acids regardless of water conditions. Root putrescine (Put) concentration was higher in AM than non-inoculated (NM) plants under well-watered conditions; the conversion of Put via diamine oxidase to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) occurred in roots of AM plants under drought stress. Leaf concentration of Put, the tricarboxylic acids, and soluble sugars significantly increased in AM plants under drought stress, showing higher values compared to that of NM plants. Moreover, photosystem II efficiency and chlorophyll concentration were higher in AM than NM plants regardless of water status. Conclusion: Fatty acid- and ornithine cycle-related metabolites along with soluble sugars, Put, and GABA were the key metabolites of AM-mediated regulations in response to drought stress.

J	Philipsen, LJ; Rood, SB				Philipsen, Laurens J.; Rood, Stewart B.			Riparian recruitment persists after damming: Environmental flows and coupled colonization of cottonwoods and willows following floods along a dryland river	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												For riparian woodlands, occasional floods provide geomorphic disturbance that creates barren colonization sites, and river stage patterns that enable seedling establishment. To investigate impacts from river damming and instream flow regulation on these processes, we studied the lower Red Deer River in the semi-arid region of Alberta, Canada. Dickson Dam was implemented in 1983 and although major flood peaks in June 2005 and June 2013 were attenuated by about one-quarter, substantial seedling establishment of plains cottonwoods (Populus deltoides) was observed. Cross-sectional transects in 2014 and 2015 revealed the reproductively mature cottonwood band from 2005, while the 2013 colonization was limited to low elevations of 0.3-1.3 m above the base river stage. Seedling numbers and the elevational ranges were probably reduced by abrupt (>4 cm/day) river stage reductions in July 2005 and in July 2013. In addition to direct seedling establishment on barren sandbars, we observed "coupled colonization" with cottonwood recruitment within sparse patches of sandbar willows (Salix exigua). The flood-tolerant willows stabilize the bars and increase aggradation through sediment trapping. Thus, cottonwood colonization persisted after damming, indicating that the pattern of downstream flow regulation was important, rather than damming per se. To sustain riparian recruitment along regulated rivers in dry regions, we recommend: (1) that floods be allowed as feasible, (2) higher river stages during seed dispersal, (3) flow ramping (gradual summer recession) for seedling survival, (4) sufficient growing season flows to avoid drought-induced mortality, and (5) that willows be encouraged as well as cottonwoods.																			1535-1459	1535-1467				NOV	2022	38	9					1642	1653		10.1002/rra.4030	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.4030		AUG 2022											WOS:000835854500001

Evaluating the trade-offs and sustainability of minimum tillage and crop-residue addition for food production in the dryland tropics	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES												A long-term study was carried out at ICRISAT farm, Patancheru (India) during rainy (kharif) season 2009-18 with an objective to evaluate impact of tillage (minimum/conventional) and residue (addition/removal) management practices on production capacity and sustainability of maize-chickpea sequential and maize+pigeonpea intercropping systems. The experiment was laid out in spilt plot design with 4 replications. The effects of residue addition were inconsistent till the third year of experiment. However, yield benefits from residue addition became apparent fourth year onwards. After 7 years, residue addition showed significant yield benefits to the tune of 9-25% during 2016-17 (8th cropping cycle) and 18-31% during 2017-18 (9th cropping cycle) in both cropping systems. Residue addition also resulted in additional net income of (sic)16,900/ha to (sic)22,980/ha compared to no-residue addition. Minimum tillage in general tended to result in yield loss over normal tillage since beginning. During 8th and 9th cropping cycles, there was net annual loss up to (sic)5400/ha under minimum tillage. Alongside productivity and economic benefits, at the end of 8th year i.e. 2016-17, residue addition showed improved soil health and sequestered around 300 kg carbon/ha/year.

Neighbourhood-dependent root distributions and the consequences on root separation in arid ecosystems	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Interspecific root separation is an important example of spatial niche differentiation that drives species coexistence in many ecosystems. Particularly under water-stressed conditions, it is believed to be an inevitable outcome of species interactions. However, evidence for and against this idea has been found. So far, studies aiming at reconciling the debate have mainly focused on abiotic determinants. It remains unclear if and to what extent root separation depends on the type and growth form of interacting plants. We conducted a detailed field study in three adjacently located (with pairwise distances <500 m) arid patchy communities where a common tussock grass species Achnatherum splendens grew in association with either a tree Elaeagnus angustifolia, a shrub Nitraria tangutorum or a perennial forb species Sophora alopecuroides. In each community, roots and soils were sampled along the soil layers from five depths (0-10, 10-30, 30-60, 60-100 and 100-150 cm) in the patches and in the adjacent bare ground outside the patches. Significant vertical interspecific root separation occurred in the species-association patches of tree-grass and forb-grass communities, but not in the shrub-grass community. As the neighbour changed going from trees to shrubs and to forbs, rooting profiles of the grass Achnatherum became progressively deeper, with progressively less roots allocated in the upmost 10 cm soil layer and more in the subsequent two layers. After controlling for the differences in soil water and nutrient conditions among the three communities, the effects of neighbour type on grass rooting profiles remained robust. Synthesis. We found that the root distributions of plants in the dryland strongly depend on the type of neighbour plants, which can, at least partially, determine the extent of interspecific root separation at the community scale. Our work poses new questions about plasticity in root distribution and helps to better understand species interactions and coexistence under stressful conditions.					Chen, Bin J.

An Integrated Watershed Management (IWM) plan was initiated in the Karamoja region, aimed at generating information that could be used to reduce climate vulnerabilities among the rural poor. The study aimed at determining the local community's perception of the effects of climate change on their livelihoods; and, to examine the effectiveness of the Integrated Watershed Management practices (IWMPs) on agricultural production within the area. Three hundred and ninety-seven households were randomly chosen and included in the survey. Interviews with local government officials who held high posts were conducted. Direct observations were also used for data collection. Findings showed that droughts and increases in pests and diseases; were some of the impacts caused by climate change events. Despite the initiation of IWMPs, climate change events moderately increased food insecurity (gamma = 0.556; P=0.000) and also moderately affected community assets like roads and valley dams (gamma = 0.426; P=0.000). In addition, household income insecurity was moderately and positively related to climate change effects (gamma = 0.556; P=0.000). A weak positive relationship was found between the application of IWMPs and agricultural production (gamma = 0.273; P=0.000). The Uganda Government should emphasize and intensify the implementation of IWMPs among the farmers living in agricultural watersheds as a means of continuously improving agricultural production and building the farmers' resilience to climate change events.

Field applications of gypsum reduce pH and improve soil C in highly alkaline soils in southern Australia's dryland cropping region	SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT												Highly alkaline soils are widespread throughout south-eastern Australia. High pH limits the accumulation and retention of organic carbon (C), and thus the availability of nutrients to crops and is also associated with various elemental deficiencies and toxicities that restrict crop productivity. Applying gypsum and increasing legume production reduce pH and improve soil chemical and physical properties in alkaline, sodic soils, but this strategy has not been explored in alkaline soils in the region where many of the topsoils are non-sodic. Five short-term rotation experiments were conducted to examine the potential to reduce pH, improve soil organic C and increase crop production. In the first year, three legumes-field peas (Pisum sativum), vetch (Vicia sativa) and a medic pasture (Medicago spp.)-were grown at low or high inputs of seed and fertilizer and with three rates of gypsum (0, 2.5 t/ha and 5.0 t/ha). In the following seasons, wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) were grown. Using high sowing and fertilizer rates to increase legume biomass had little effect on soil properties; however, applying gypsum consistently resulted in a lower soil pH and dissolved organic C and higher organic C compared with the unamended control to a depth of 0.20-0.30 m. The largest difference occurred with 2.5 t gypsum/ha with little further change at 5 t/ha. Gypsum significantly increased biomass and grain yield at sites with low concentrations of calcium carbonate. Low rates of gypsum may be effective in reducing pH, maintaining soil organic C and improving crop production in regions with alkaline soils low in calcium carbonate.

Venkata; Parashar, Abhinav; Pankaj, Prabhat Kumar			Soil-plant-animal Continuum Concerning the Certain Micro-mineral Status of Indigenous Sheep in Hot Semi-arid Regions	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL RESEARCH												Background: Semi-arid regions have a large livestock population that grazes on nutrient-depleted natural grasses and crop leftovers, resulting in mineral shortages. The goal of this study was to determine the amounts of iron (Fe), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) in soil, pasture and sheep serum in semi-arid areas with low rainfall (498-522 mm) in order to construct a soil-plant-animal continuum and recommend solutions to increase trace element availability. Methods: Samples were collected from different parts of the continuum [Soil (n=50), pasture (n=50) and blood samples from sheep (n=50)] from the selected study area and the trace elements were analyzed after digestion using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Descriptive, correlation and t-test analyses were carried out to categorize the deficiency, their significance and soil-plant-animal continuum. Result: Although most soil samples were found to be below threshold levels, most straws and stovers in the field had marginal levels of these micro-minerals. Most sheep serum samples had levels of different micro-minerals that were below the threshold level, implying that many indigenous sheep are deficient in micro-minerals. Although there was a substantial association between feed, fodder and sheep serum, there was no such correlation between trace mineral levels in sheep serum and soil. A higher percentage of these microminerals in sheep faeces implies that these nutrients are truly recycled through faeces and urine in semi-arid rural areas. To address the sub-clinical micro-mineral insufficiency in semi-arid regions, micro-mineral supplementation, particularly Zn, Cu and Mn, is required.																			0367-6722					JUN	2022	56	6					688	694	B-4854	10.18805/IJAR.B-4854	http://dx.doi.org/10.18805/IJAR.B-4854													WOS:000814494800008
J	Danet, A; Schneider, FD; Anthelme, F; Kéfi, S				Danet, Alain; Schneider, Florian Dirk; Anthelme, Fabien; Kefi, Sonia			Indirect facilitation drives species composition and stability in drylands	THEORETICAL ECOLOGY												Dryland ecosystems are likely to respond discontinuously to gradual changes in environmental conditions. Direct facilitation between plants, whereby plants improve the local environmental conditions for others, has been shown to be a mechanism contributing to these discontinuous ecosystem transitions. Theoretical models describing dryland vegetation dynamics often consider a single plant species and one type of facilitation, namely direct facilitation. However, another type of facilitation-indirect facilitation-is widespread in dryland ecosystems as well; it is performed by plants protected against grazing, the nurses, when this protection extends to other plants growing in their neighbourhood that are deprived of such protection, the protegees. Little is known about the long-term effects of indirect facilitation on dryland dynamics. Here, we developed and analysed a theoretical model including two species-a nurse and a protegee-and indirect facilitation through grazing. We investigated the effects of indirect facilitation on species composition, species spatial clustering and the stability of dryland ecosystems. We showed that indirect facilitation through grazing enables the stable coexistence of the nurse and the protegee and allows the reversibility of the protegee extinction. Surprisingly, the strength of indirect facilitation affected neither the total nor the interspecific vegetation clustering. Our study highlights that spatially explicit grazing protection may affect species composition and the stability of dryland ecosystems and gives hints about how species interactions translate into spatial clustering.

ANALYSIS THE RELATIONSHIP OF DIFFERENT YIELD LEVELS AND WATER USE OF DRYLAND WHEAT (<i>TRITICUM AESTIVUM </i>L.) UNDER DIFFERENT FALLOW TILLAGE TYPES	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Tillage method does exert a certain regulatory effect on yield of rainfed crops. A field experiment was established on the Loess Plateau and was for 8 years during 2009???2017. Three types of fallow tillage (no-tillage, deep plough and subsoiling) were used, and divided the yield with cluster analysis, studied the relationship of the main yield components and precipitation, soil water storage and water use. The results showed that the yield of wheat was influenced by the adjustment of the distribution of yield components in different precipitation years, and the number of plural was the main factor to obtain higher yield, which was influenced by the precipitation during the fallow-period and the sowing-anthesis period, the reasonable distribution of grain number per spike and 1000-grain weight is the factor of high yield, which is mainly affected by precipitation and soil water consumption at the later growth stage. In addition, cultivation during fallow-period can achieve higher yield, but under the influence of precipitation type, DP during growth-dry year type was more favorable to the increase of field evapotranspiration, the growth-wet type of SS was more beneficial to the improvement of water use efficiency.

Contrasting patterns at interspecific and intraspecific levels in scorpion body size across a climatic gradient from rainforest to dryland vegetation	ZOOLOGY												Body size is believed to be one of the most fundamental functional traits in animals and is evolutionarily conserved in order to guarantee the survival of the species. Besides the phylogenetic backgrounds, body size patterns might be a product of environmental filters, especially within fine taxonomic levels (i.e., within species or geographical lineages). Here, we evaluated the responses of scorpion body size at different organizational levels (inter and intraspecific) along a dry-wet climatic gradient in Brazilian forests. Scorpions were collected from 20 localities in northeastern Brazil, covering 12 sites of dry forests and eight sites in rainforest environments. As a proxy for body size, we measured the carapace length of 368 adult scorpions belonging to 11 species and applied linear mixed-effects models to investigate the potential effects of climatic features and geographical tendencies in this trait at inter- and intraspecific levels. Our findings suggest the existence of a longitudinal pattern of body size in scorpions with species becoming larger in an east-west direction (i.e., towards the continent); such geographical tendency was also detected for one of the three species analyzed at the population level. In addition, the warmer temperature had a negative effect on body size in scorpions at inter- and intraspecific levels. Based on these findings, we assert that body size in scorpions is not affected solely by their phylogenetic history, but also by the physiological constraints imposed by the environment, which becomes more evident across climatic gradients.

It generally lives in semi-arid desert steppe regions, often denning in small caves, rock shelters, and burrows close to human settlements. Bone fragments of wild and domestic animals and desiccated scats are frequently found in the hyena dens. In this study, eight striped hyena desiccated scats were subjected to pollen analysis. All scats were rich in pollen and the exine was well-preserved with no visible sign of corrosion. Pollen spectra revealed interesting information on the regional and local vegetation, as well as the foraging behavior and diet of the animal. They reflected an array of different landscapes ranging from natural/semi-natural xerophytic desert steppes, agricultural fields, and grazing pastures. Some scats contained certain pollen taxa very rarely observed in wetland sediments, indicating the high potential of hyena "copropalynology" in providing detailed information on the past floristic composition of the landscape. When comparing with archeobotanical data from the area, the hyena scat assemblages show that the general physiognomy of the landscape has remained almost unchanged since the 6th millennium B.C., with only minor changes in the composition or density of the woody components of the desert steppe. As most of the Holocene fossil coprolites in archeological and paleontological sites of SW Asia would have been left by striped hyena, the study of the modern analogs of such accumulations in extant hyena dens is helpful to correctly interpret the fossil faunal assemblages to reconstruct the paleolandscapes, land-use change, and animal paleoethology.

Modest Residual Effects of Short-Term Warming, Altered Hydration, and Biocrust Successional State on Dryland Soil Heterotrophic Carbon and Nitrogen Cycling	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) on the Colorado Plateau may fuel carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling of soil heterotrophic organisms throughout the region. Late successional moss and lichen biocrusts, in particular, can increase soil C and N availability, but some data suggest these biocrust types will be replaced by early successional cyanobacterial biocrusts as the region undergoes warming and aridification. In this study, we evaluated the short-term interactive effects of biocrust successional state and elevated temperature on soil heterotrophic C and N cycling (specifically, soil respiration, N2O emissions, microbial biomass C and N, and soluble C and N). We collected soils following an 87-day greenhouse mesocosm experiment where the soils had been topped with different biocrust successional states (moss-dominated, cyanobacteria-dominated, or no biocrust) and had experienced different temperatures (ambient and warmed), under an artificial precipitation regime. Following this pre-incubation mesocosm phase, the soils were assessed using a short-term (2-day) laboratory incubation to determine the cumulative effect of the elevated temperature and altered biocrust successional state on the temperature sensitivity of soil heterotrophic C and N cycling. We found that there were interactive effects of biocrust successional state and exposure to warmer temperatures during the mesocosm phase under greenhouse conditions on the rate and temperature sensitivity of soil heterotrophic C and N cycling in laboratory incubations. Soils collected from beneath late successional biocrusts exhibited higher C and N cycling rates than those from beneath early successional crusts, while warming reduced both the magnitude and the temperature sensitivity of C and N cycling. The inhibiting effect of warming, was most evident in soils from beneath late successional biocrusts, which, during the mesocosm phase, also exhibited the greatest reductions in gross primary production and respiration in response to the warming treatment. Taken together, these data suggest that an overall effect of climate warming may be increasing resource limitation of the soil heterotrophic C and N cycles in the region, which may magnify alterations associated with the changes in biocrust community structure documented in previous studies. Overall, results from this study suggest that soil heterotrophic biogeochemical cycling is affected by interactions between temperature and the biocrust community that lives atop the mineral soil, with important implications for C and N cycling into the future.

Yet, the resulting net impact of CO2 fertilization on plant growth and soil moisture (SM) savings at large scale is poorly understood. Drylands provide a natural experimental setting to detect the CO2 fertilization effect on plant growth since foliage amount, plant water-use and photosynthesis are all tightly coupled in water-limited ecosystems. A long-term change in the response of leaf area index (LAI, a measure of foliage amount) to changes in SM is likely to stem from changing water demand of primary productivity in water-limited ecosystems and is a proxy for changes in WUE. Using 34-year satellite observations of LAI and SM over tropical and subtropical drylands, we identify that a 1% increment in SM leads to 0.15% (+/- 0.008, 95% confidence interval) and 0.51% (+/- 0.01, 95% confidence interval) increments in LAI during 1982-1998 and 1999-2015, respectively. The increasing response of LAI to SM has contributed 7.2% (+/- 3.0%, 95% confidence interval) to total dryland greening during 1999-2015 compared to 1982-1998. The increasing response of LAI to SM is consistent with the CO2 fertilization effect on WUE in water-limited ecosystems, indicating that a given amount of SM has sustained greater amounts of photosynthetic foliage over time. The LAI responses to changes in SM from seven dynamic global vegetation models are not always consistent with observations, highlighting the need for improved process knowledge of terrestrial ecosystem responses to rising atmospheric CO2 concentration.

Francesca			Addressing the soil carbon dilemma: Legumes in intensified rotations regenerate soil carbon while maintaining yields in semi-arid dryland wheat farms	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Semi-arid regions support the majority of global wheat production, but they are threatened by continued soil erosion and increased risk of drought and extreme temperatures from climate change. Enhancing soil organic matter (SOM) is a key adaptation strategy for sustaining agriculture in these regions because it can improve water retention and nutrient cycling. When seeking to increase SOM, growers face a dilemma, known as the 'soil carbon (C) dilemma' (Janzen, 2006): How can SOM be increased, while also increasing the release of nutrients that accompanies decomposition? Our observational study examined whether growers could address this dilemma through intensification with diverse grain crops. We specifically tested whether incorporating legumes into a continuous rotation influences the form and amount of SOM as well as productivity in farms of the central Great Plains region of the U.S. by contrasting three, no-till rotation systems: 1) conventional wheat-fallow; 2) continuous grain-only rotations, and 3) continuous grain rotations that incorporate a legume crop. We sampled on-farm fields and experimental agricultural research station plots that had received one of these rotations for at least eight years. We compared yield, soil organic C (SOC), and nitrogen (N) stocks in bulk soil to 1 m, as well as SOC and N in particulate organic matter (POM) and mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) in surface soils (0-10 cm) among the different rotations. We also estimated the long-term effects of the rotations on SOC fractions through a simulation of each rotation with the MEMS 1.0 model, verified with measured data.We found that intensifying the rotation with continuous grains led to 1.5-fold increase in aggregate size but did not change SOC stocks. Incorporating a legume to the continuous grain rotation resulted in 1 Mg C ha(-1) more SOC on average in surface soil compared to wheat-fallow rotations. No significant soil changes among rotations were observed at depth. Longer-term simulations of these cropping systems suggest that including legumes could allow for 10% greater SOC gains over time compared to wheat-fallow. Since legume incorporation also increased crop yields across the full rotation cycle, our results support our hypothesis that growers can solve the 'soil C dilemma' by simultaneously increasing the quantity and N-content of soil input through continuous cropping with both grains and legumes.						van der Pol, Laura/0000-0002-9430-5985													0167-8809	1873-2305				JUN 1	2022	330								107906	10.1016/j.agee.2022.107906	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2022.107906		FEB 2022											WOS:000790163200003

Impacts of Rumen Degradable or Undegradable Protein Supplementation on Supplement Intake and Performance of Yearling Heifers and Cows Grazing Dryland Pastures	ANIMALS												Simple Summary This study was conducted to evaluate intake and performance of beef cattle provided different protein supplements on pasture. Protein sources were rumen degradable protein (RDP) and rumen undegradable protein (RUP) supplied as pressed blocks provided in two time periods. Protein supplement was provided before and during the breeding season. Intake, intake behavior, and weight gain were compared between cattle offered either protein type. Typically, due to the RDP available during the summer grazing season, supplementation is not conducted. However, due to the RDP content of forages, RUP may be beneficial for grazing animals to provide a more direct protein source for the animal. Therefore, this study analyzed how effectively RUP or RDP supplementation was for grazing animals and found that protein type did impact intake behavior of both heifers and cows. Angus and Red Angus-based yearling heifers (n = 40) and lactating cows (n = 51) were each used in a complete randomized design and stratified by weight and body condition score to one of two treatments: (1) pressed supplement block containing rumen undegradable protein (RUP) and (2) pressed supplement block containing rumen degradable protein (RDP). Heifer and cow supplement intake displayed (p < 0.01) a treatment x period interaction. The RUP heifers and RDP cows consumed more in Period 2 than Period 1, whereas RDP heifers and RUP cows consumed more in Period 1 than Period 2, respectively. Intake rate demonstrated (p < 0.01) a treatment effect for heifers, with RUP consuming supplement faster than the RDP treatment. Intake rate for cows demonstrated (p < 0.01) a treatment x period interaction with RUP cows in Period 1 having faster intakes than Period 2, and RDP cows having the inverse. Cow intake variation displayed (p < 0.01) a treatment x period interaction with RUP cows having more variation in Period 2, while RDP cows had less variation in intake in Period 2. In conclusion, RDP and RUP impacted intake behavior of cows and heifers but had minimal impacts on performance.

First excavation campaign in the <i>qarya</i> de La Graja (Higueruela, Albacete)	ARQUEOLOGIA Y TERRITORIO MEDIEVAL												In this paper we will analyse the archaeological register provided by the first excavation campaign in the village of La Graja (Higueruela, Albacete) during the year 2020, from which we intend to obtain data that will provide us with a first knowledge about the Andalusian settlement in the south-eastern regions of La Mancha. The archaeological excavation complements the information provided by the surveys carried out in the castral territory of Chinchilla in the Andalusian period and in the Corredor de Almansa, an area of dry land where an intense occupation is documented during the 11th century articulated in a considerable number of villages (qura) on the plain. This intervention has documented a modest and functional domestic architecture characterised by the use of the resources of the environment (stone, earth and wood), without decorative elements or elaborate materials such as brick, and whose spaces lack the functional specialisation typical of urban houses.																			1134-3184	2386-5423					2021	28						45	90	e6360	10.17561/aytm.v28.6360	http://dx.doi.org/10.17561/aytm.v28.6360													WOS:000727657700004

In Ethiopia, the impacts of climate change on crop yields are rarely available at the lowest administrative levels such as wards/villages, for the benefits of the grassroots' populace. Thus, this research sought to evaluate the use of crop water requirements in the estimation of crops' yield. Food and Agriculture Organization's CROPWAT 8.0 application was used to pre-determine the possibility, preceding the use of crop yield estimation model (CROWRAYEM). Both CROPWAT 8.0 and CROWRAYEM had high coefficients of determination when tested with a survey data of barley and sorghum farmers' yield for the 2015 to 2018 cropping seasons in semi-arid southern Tigray, northern Ethiopia. Furthermore, the infusion of the crop yield into a recently published area yield index insurance payout structure increases the functionality of the proposed yield estimated model (CROWRAYEM).

Since photosynthetic organisms are at the base of ecosystem's trophic networks, we compared an endolithic desiccation-tolerant Chroococcidiopsis cyanobacteria isolated from gypsum rocks in the Atacama Desert with a freshwater desiccation-sensitive Synechocystis. We sought whether some acclimation traits in response to desiccation and temperature variations were shared, to evaluate the potential of temperate species to possibly become resilient to future arid conditions. When temperature varies, Synechocystis tunes the acyl composition of its lipids, via a homeoviscous acclimation mechanism known to adjust membrane fluidity, whereas no such change occurs in Chroococcidiopsis. Vice versa, a combined study of photosynthesis and pigment content shows that Chroococcidiopsis remodels its photosynthesis components and keeps an optimal photosynthetic capacity at all temperatures, whereas Synechocystis is unable to such adjustment. Upon desiccation on a gypsum surface, Synechocystis is rapidly unable to revive, whereas Chroococcidiopsis is capable to recover after three weeks. Using X-ray diffraction, we found no evidence that Chroococcidiopsis could use water extracted from gypsum crystals in such conditions as a surrogate for missing water. The sulfolipid sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol becomes the prominent membrane lipid in both dehydrated cyanobacteria, highlighting an overlooked function for this lipid. Chroococcidiopsis keeps a minimal level of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, which may be essential for the recovery process. Results support that two independent adaptation strategies have evolved in these species to cope with temperature and desiccation increase and suggest some possible scenarios for microbial biodiversity change triggered by climate change.																			0032-0781	1471-9053				2023 NOV 7	2023										10.1093/pcp/pcad139	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcad139		NOV 2023						37944070					WOS:001105520000001

Understanding the regulatory mechanism of flag leaf chlorophyll content could accelerate breeding for drought resistance. In this study, we constructed a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population from a cross of drought-sensitive variety DH118 and drought-resistant variety Jinmai 919, and analyzed the chlorophyll contents of flag leaves in six experimental locations/years using the Wheat90K single-nucleotide polymorphism array. A total of 29 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling flag leaf chlorophyll were detected with contributions to phenotypic variation ranging from 4.67 to 23.25%. Twelve QTLs were detected under irrigated conditions and 18 were detected under dryland (drought) conditions. Most of the QTLs detected under the different water regimes were different. Four major QTLs (Qchl.saw-3B.2, Qchl.saw-5A.2, Qchl.saw-5A.3, and Qchl.saw-5B.2) were detected in the RIL population. Qchl.saw-3B.2, possibly more suitable for marker-assisted selection of genotypes adapted to irrigated conditions, was validated by a tightly linked kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASP) marker in a doubled haploid population derived from a different cross. Qchl.saw-5A.3, a novel stably expressed QTL, was detected in the dryland environments and explained up to 23.25% of the phenotypic variation, and has potential for marker-assisted breeding of genotypes adapted to dryland conditions. The stable and major QTLs identified here add valuable information for understanding the genetic mechanism underlying chlorophyll content and provide a basis for molecular marker-assisted breeding.																				1664-8021				MAR 15	2022	13								832898	10.3389/fgene.2022.832898	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2022.832898								35368684					WOS:000777495200001

However, most regional to global databases provide only presence or presence/absence data. The main aim of this paper is to develop a methodology to estimate plant species abundances from a presence/absence database using as a case-study the largest and one of the most diverse tropical dry forest of the world - the understudied Caatinga vegetation, that dominates in the drylands of Brazil. Plant data missed abundance estimations and derived from different sources, with uneven sampling efforts over space and time. Starting from the raw data, we considered only the presence records of terrestrial plant individuals identified to the species-level. Afterwards, we applied the re-sampling method to estimate species abundances thus obtaining database DB1. To deal with the uneven sampling effort along the study area and increase information reliability, we filtered DB1 in two ways: (i) we excluded re-sampling units with a lower sampling effort and produced the Database DB2; (ii) we excluded low occurrence species and build the Database DB3. The reliability of the databases was compared by calculating a measure of their completeness. DB1 had 789 species over 323 sampling units, DB2 retained 530 species distributed in 38 sampling units, and DB3 retained 48 species over 113 sampling units. In DB1 and DB2, despite the different number of species considered, the percentage of exotic (7%), endemism (14%), woody (44%), climber (12%), and herbaceous species (45%) was similar. DB3 included only native species (no exotic species) and displayed a higher percentage of endemism (29%) and woody species (79%), and a lower proportion of herbaceous species (21%) than DB1 and DB2. The databases obtained provide an important basis to improve Caatinga ecological knowledge and conservation: we suggest the use of DB2 to support conservation strategies, and of DB3 to support ecosystem structure and functioning studies. Moreover, the re-sampling methodology proposed to estimate plant abundances from presence data, dealing with uneven sampling efforts across large areas and over time, provides an important tool that may be used to obtain abundance data, often essential to the development of plant-based indicators of ecosystem structure and functioning, and to support conservation studies.

Based on a 10-year field experiment, an aerobic incubation experiment (105 days) was conducted to determine soil mineralized C and mineralized N at two depths (0-20 and 20-40 cm) under four cropping treatments (winter wheat with no fertilizer (Ctr), N fertilizer (N), phosphorus fertilizer (P), and N and P fertilizers (NP)) and two fallowing treatments (natural-F and bare-F). Results showed that compared with Ctr, N and NP significantly increased the wheat grain and straw yield. N, NP, and natural-F significantly increased the soil organic N concentration by 10.4%, 15.2%, and 22.0%, respectively, at 0-20-cm soil depth, and the natural-F significantly increased the soil organic C concentration by 16.8%. Additionally, bare-F led to lower soil organic N at the two soil depths and soil organic C at 0-20-cm depth when compared with NP and natural-F. The highest net mineralized N and C were observed in soils with the highest organic N and C contents (i.e., natural-F). Meanwhile, the lowest net mineralized N and C were observed in the treatments with the lowest soil organic N and C contents (i.e., bare-F). Therefore, in the Loess Plateau, the management of NP application is critical for increasing grain yield, maintaining soil C and N levels and supplying adequate N to the plants. By contrast, the application of N alone, P alone, or bare fallow is not a useful method for maintaining soil fertility.

Here, a field experiment was conducted to assess the effect of combined controlled release urea and normal urea on root growth and water extraction of maize in dryland fields. Maize in the combined controlled release urea and normal urea treatment had greater root systems compared to those in the normal urea treatment and no N application treatment. Compared to the urea treatment, combined controlled release urea and normal urea advanced the root length density and root weight density in the 0-10 cm soil layer at R1 stage by 30.99% and 45.03% in 2016 and by 20.54% and 19.13% in 2017. The root length density also increased at the dent stage (R5) by 52.05% and 47.75% in 2016 and 2017, and root weight density increased by 19.58% in 2016. Combined controlled release urea and normal urea promoted production of fine roots and root distribution, as well as decreased soil water storage (SWS) in the deep soil layer at the R5 stage. The grain yield was positively correlated with root length density and root weight density in the topsoil layer at the silking stage (R1) and in the whole soil profile at the R5 stage, suggesting that better root system management is helpful for increasing crop grain yield. Therefore, this work demonstrates that combined use of controlled release urea and normal urea to higher crop yields might attribute to increasing water extraction by optimizing in-season maize root morphology and distribution in the rainfed farmland of the Loess Plateau.					sun, hao/GRS-7732-2022; sun, hao/HMD-2991-2023															2073-4395				OCT	2020	10	10							1606	10.3390/agronomy10101606	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10101606													WOS:000584147100001

Particularly, optical Sentinel-2 (S2) data with its capability of providing high spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions creates ample opportunities. However, few studies so far evaluated the combined use of S2 derived variables and environmental variables for modeling the distribution of invasive species. This study aims to compare the performance of models using S2 derived variables with environmental variables and their integration for modeling invasive Prosopis juliflora in the lower Awash River basin of Ethiopia. A total of 680 field data were used to train and validate the Random Forest (RF) approach. Model performances were evaluated using True Skill Statistics (TSS), kappa index, correlation, area under the curve (ROC), sensitivity and specificity. Our results demonstrated that modeling using S2 vegetation indices and S2 spectral bands showed higher performance compared to topoclimatic based variables with TSS of 0.91, 0.89, and 0.74, respectively. The ROC also confirmed the higher accuracy of S2 vegetation indices, S2 spectral bands and combined models compared to a topo-climatic based modeling. Interestingly, models using the integration of S2 derived variables with topo-climatic variables showed even better performance than the individual models. Our study highlighted that S2 derived variables and their integration with topo-climatic variables are highly recommended for efficient monitoring of invasive species distribution.

The response of sorghum hybrids to SCA was evaluated during 2017 in Guanajuato, Mexico. Experiments were established under strip-plot designs with two factors (hybrids, threshold-based chemical management -TBCMtreatments) and under irrigated or dryland conditions. Experiments were established on two sowing dates at Celaya and Valle de Santiago (irrigated) using the SCA-tolerant hybrids APACHE, BRS-70, MEZQUITE, SCAP-618, and SCA-susceptible UPM-219. Dryland experiments were established at Celaya, Valle de Santiago, and Penjamo using MEZQUITE, and SCAP-618 (tolerant), and lines UPM-219, SHORTER, and MAJESTIC-355 (susceptible). The TBCM strategies were a) with TBCM (seed treatment with thiamethoxam; flupyradifurone or sulfoxaflor applied to foliage), and b) without TBCM (control). Significant differences (p < 0.05) between treatments under irrigated and dryland conditions for the number of aphids per leaf and grain yield were found. APACHE, BRS-70, and MEZQUITE had the highest grain yields under both TBCM and no-TBCM. UPM-219 was competitive under TBCM conditions, but without TBCM showed total yield losses. The yield-aphid cumulative density linear regressions were negatively significant (p & LE; 0.05) to sorghum cultivated without TBCM. Irrigation increased 64 % grain yields compared with dryland experiments. TBCM increased grain yield (50 % in irrigated and 100 % in dryland conditions). TBCM increased grain yields and reduced cumulative SCA populations under irrigated or rainfed conditions, mainly for susceptible sorghum. Resistant germplasm and TBCM could control SCA in sorghum cultivated in Guanajuato, mainly at late sowings frequently carried out under dryland conditions.

This study quantitatively analyzed the land use change characteristics in the Huaihe River Eco-economic Belt from 1980 to 2020 using the land use transfer matrix and land use intensity index. Further, the evolution of ecological risks and their driving mechanisms were investigated using the landscape pattern index and hierarchical partitioning analysis. The results show that (1) in terms of absolute area, dryland, grassland, and paddy land decreased by 7075 km(2), 2708 km(2), and 1874 km(2), respectively, while urban-rural land and water area increased by 10,538 km(2) and 1336 km(2), respectively. In terms of change intensity, grassland, water area, urban-rural land, and unused land exhibited the most dramatic change, whereas forest land, paddy land, and dryland exhibited weaker change. (2) The conversions in the study area were primarily between dryland, paddy land, and urban-rural land. Paddy land and dryland tended to convert to urban-rural land, which is further likely to be transformed into dryland and unused land when converted. (3) The study area mainly presented medium to low ecological risk. Overall, the ecological risk remained stable throughout the study period. Nevertheless, Jining, Zaozhuang, and Bengbu show high ecological risks in the construction of the economic zone. (4) Forest land explained 40% of the variance in landscape risk, whereas urban-rural land and dryland each explained 20% of the variance. An increase in the proportion of urban-rural land and dryland will increase landscape ecological risk. However, after urban-rural land exceeds 15%, the ecological security risk does not increase significantly with increasing proportion of urban-rural land.

We found that moderate disturbance improved the microbial community structure in biocrusts in a one-year field experiment in a dryland ecosystem. However, whether the improvement of microbial community structure in biocrusts can be sustained for a long time is unclear. Here, considering microorganisms as indicators, we used the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) method to examine changes in the microbial communities of biocrusts under varying disturbance intensities from 2016 to 2019. We found that under moderate disturbance, the total microbial PLFAs of biocrusts increased by 11 similar to 94% in the 4 years of disturbance, and the microbial community in biocrusts was more abundant under such disturbance than under no disturbance over time. The ratios of fungal to bacterial PLFAs (F/B) and gram-negative to gram-positive bacterial PLFAs (G-/G+) under moderate disturbance increased over time. However, these variables decreased over time under low- and high-intensity disturbances. The alterations were related to improvements in cyanobacterial biomass, available N, soil moisture, and vegetation coverage and a reduction in the C/N ratio. Through a long-term experiment, we demonstrated that improvements in microbial community in biocrusts under moderate disturbance can be maintained over the long term.

Inoculation with dark septate endophytes (DSE) can increase the yields of conventional crops grown in monoculture, but the effects of DSE on the growth and yield of intercropped plants are unknown. Here, a field experiment was conducted in a coal mining subsidence area on the loess plateau in 2020 and 2021. The two crops were buckwheat and alfalfa, with four treatments for each crop: sole cropping control, sole cropping with DSE inoculation, intercropping control, and intercropping with DSE inoculation. The yields, land equivalent ratios, DSE colonization rates, and yield components of buckwheat and alfalfa were compared in the different treatments. Stepwise regression and path analysis was conducted to identify the factors that determined crop yields. Yields of intercropped buckwheat and alfalfa with DSE inoculation increased in two consecutive years compared with sole cropping control, with yields increasing in 2020 by 117 and 86%, respectively. In 2021, the yield of buckwheat in intercropping with DSE inoculation did not increase significantly, but the yield of alfalfa increased by 120% compared with the sole cropping control. Buckwheat-alfalfa intercropping has the advantage of increasing the yield. DSE inoculation significantly increased the yield of buckwheat-alfalfa intercropping in 2020, but there was no yield advantage in 2021. The yield components of buckwheat and alfalfa showed inconsistent differences among experimental treatments. Stepwise regression and path analysis shows that the DSE colonization rate played an important role in the yield, which was an increased in buckwheat and alfalfa in 2020 and 2021. DSE affected the buckwheat yield indirectly by increasing the grain weight per plant, plant phosphorus uptake, and plant nitrogen content. DSE indirectly affected alfalfa yields by increasing plant nitrogen uptake and plant height. DSE may therefore have some potential to increase yields in buckwheat-alfalfa intercropping systems in coal mining subsidence areas.

Toward optimisation of water use efficiency in dryland pastures using carbon isotope discrimination as a tool to select plant species mixtures	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Pastoral agriculture is important for supplying global demand for animal products but pasture productivity is often water limited. Increased plant diversity has been shown to increase water use efficiency (omega) and productivity under water limitation but the optimal mix of species varies spatially, dependent on climate, soil type, and plant water requirements. Consequently, a cost-effective method to screen for high omega plant species and mixes in situ at farm scale is needed. Using carbon isotope discrimination (Delta C-13) to examine omega is attractive because the method integrates over useful time scales, does not modify the measurement environment, and is cost-effective. Field scale omega was measured using eddy covariance (EC) at two sites with contrasting plant diversity (2 species, 7 species) and compared to the seasonal progression of omega calculated from foliage Delta C-13 (omega(Delta)). Soil water evaporation (E-S) was removed from EC measured total ecosystem evaporation using a modelling approach and canopy omega (omega(C)) was calculated as gross primary production (GPP) divided by canopy evaporation. Mixed species foliage samples were harvested pre-grazing, dried, sub-sampled, ground, and the ratio of C-13 to C-12 was measured. A strong positive correlation was found between omega(Delta) and omega(C) at both study sites (r(2) > 0.83, p < 0.01). In addition to bulk biomass samples, individual species were also harvested seasonally. Relative increases in both omega(Delta) and production for somespecies showed that manipulation of pasture species mixtures may lead to increased omega. Combined with production monitoring, Delta C-13 could be developed as a tool to optimise species selection for site specific climate and soil conditions to maximise omega and farm production and profit.

Partial shading by solar panels delays bloom, increases floral abundance during the late-season for pollinators in a dryland, agrivoltaic ecosystem	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Habitat for pollinators is declining worldwide, threatening the health of both wild and agricultural ecosystems. Photovoltaic solar energy installation is booming, frequently near agricultural lands, where the land underneath ground-mounted photovoltaic panels is traditionally unused. Some solar developers and agriculturalists in the United States are filling the solar understory with habitat for pollinating insects in efforts to maximize land-use efficiency in agricultural lands. However, the impact of the solar panel canopy on the understory pollinator-plant community is unknown. Here we investigated the effects of solar arrays on plant composition, bloom timing and foraging behavior of pollinators from June to September (after peak bloom) in full shade plots and partial shade plots under solar panels as well as in full sun plots (controls) outside of the solar panels. We found that floral abundance increased and bloom timing was delayed in the partial shade plots, which has the potential to benefit late-season foragers in water-limited ecosystems. Pollinator abundance, diversity, and richness were similar in full sun and partial shade plots, both greater than in full shade. Pollinator-flower visitation rates did not differ among treatments at this scale. This demonstrates that pollinators will use habitat under solar arrays, despite variations in community structure across shade gradients. We anticipate that these findings will inform local farmers and solar developers who manage solar understories, as well as agriculture and pollinator health advocates as they seek land for pollinator habitat restoration in target areas.

Using yellow basins for the insects sampling, a total of 6683 specimens of aphids were collected and identified into 33 species, five (05) subfamilies: Aphidi-nae, Pemphiginae, Chaitophorinae, Pterocommatinae, and Greenideinae; and six tribes: Aphidini, Macrosiphin, Pemphigini, Panaphidini, Chaitophorini and Greenideini, and 22 genera. The Macrosiphini tribe is quantitatively most dominant with 20 species (61%) of the inventoried aphid population, followed by the aphidini which groups together 9 species representing 27% of the aphids inventoried. The other tribes are less represented, including one species for each tribe (12% in total). Aphis gossypii was the predominant species 29.67% of the inventoried spe-cies, followed by Rhopalosiphum maidis (15.22%) and Rhopalosiphum padi (15.07%). In terms of total wealth (S), there was a strong and positive correlation between the diversity of aphids and crops (R2 = 0.73), and also a significant relationship (df = 15, Pr > F = 0.024). Shannon's index spatial interpolation indicates a higher diver-sity on agricultural lands in the study area. Shannon's diversity and evenness index values were greater in pepper under greenhouse in Dhibia station (H ' = 2.01, E = 0.84) compared to barley and wheat, in El Haouch and Saada, respectively (H ' = 1.18, E = 0.30 and H' = 1.45, E = 0.21).

Urban agroecology enhances agrobiodiversity and resilient, biocultural food systems. The case of the semi-dryland and medium-sized Querétaro City, Mexico	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS												Small-scale agroecological practices in the urban areas of Queretaro, Mexico, as in other mid-sized cities, could maintain agrobiodiversity pools and sufficient productivity for a food sovereignty baseline. The application of agroecological principles fosters agrobiodiversity and socio-ecological resilience in urban food production. Emerging urban gardens result from an immediate necessity for food that does not appear in local statistics, nor is there any account of them in any cadastral source or land register of Queretaro City. Based on studies of 28 urban gardens, we survey and analyze farming practices using socio-ecological resilience methodologies and the Diagnostic Survey of Agroecological Practices. We find that the agroecological management of urban gardens results in significantly more species richness than in conventionally managed plots, likely due to the multifunctional purposes associated with biocultural memory. The number of social actors participating in agroecological management is increasing. It represents an urban strategy of resilience that contributes to enhancing the microclimate and nutrient cycling, as well as to improving water management and biodiversity. Results also indicate that gardens of approximately 200 m2 harbor the highest levels of agrobiodiversity. This area size for home vegetable production appears optimal for user-friendly management practices in urban settings and could represent the minimum benchmark for a family and a goal for urban planning and policy recommendations. Urban gardens contribute to the adaptive capacities of city dwellers to enhance their food security and sovereignty. Therefore, given that 70% of the national population face some level of food insecurity, we argue that, along with the protection of land-use rights, the promotion of a diverse urban landscape could improve long-term socio-ecological and food supply resilience. Additionally, urban gardens promote neighborhood social inclusion and affordable access to food. The empirical results and insights from this study in Queretaro can inform land-use policies for urban agriculture more broadly, especially in Latin American metropolitan areas.																				2571-581X				NOV 29	2023	7								1066428	10.3389/fsufs.2023.1066428	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1066428													WOS:001122573600001

But the effects of mulching practices on moisture preservation and yield increase are not consistent under different precipitation and temperature conditions. The Loess Plateau spans a wide range, with distinct spatiotemporal variation in its hydrothermal conditions, so the reported effects of mulching are sometimes contradictory. A meta-analysis was carried out to evaluate the impact of plastic film mulching (PFM) and straw mulching (SM) on grain yields and water use efficiency (WUE) of wheat based on data from 74 peer-reviewed publications. The results showed that PFM and SM were significantly increased wheat yield and WUE compared with no-mulching (CK). The impact of mulching on wheat yields was also affected by temperature and precipitation. PFM led to a large yield and WUE increase under low-temperature conditions, the yield and WUE under SM was significantly affected by temperature and precipitation. Compared with PFM, SM showed no yield or WUE increasement effect under high temperature with low precipitation (> 10 degrees C, <= 350 mm) or low temperature with high precipitation (<= 10 degrees C, > 350 mm). Meanwhile, our study found that PFM may reduce the yield gap between potential and actual yields compared to SM. These results have important implications for choosing proper mulching practices to increase wheat yields and WUE in agricultural production under local hydrothermal conditions.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				APR 30	2022	264								107422	10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107422	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107422		FEB 2022											WOS:000793045300002

However, there has been limited guidance regarding which, if any, machine learning models and covariate sets might be optimal for predicting soil salinity across different oases in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XJUAR) of China. This study aimed to compare five machine learning algorithms, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Multiple Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest tree ensembles (RF), and Stochastic Gradient Treeboost (SGT), to predict soil salinity in three geographically distinct areas (the Qitai, Kuqa, and Yutian oases). A total of 21 data sets from three oases were used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm and to screen the optimal variables. The results show the following indices are considered to be important indicators for quantitative assessment of soil salinity: EEVI, CSRI, EVI2, GDVI, SAIO, and SIT. Comparison results show that SGT is the most suitable algorithm for predicting soil salinity in arid areas. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of machine learning techniques for soil salinity prediction and may assist in the modeling and variable selection of digital soil mapping in the XJUAR of China.

Weed Seed Bank Diversity in Dryland Cereal Fields: Does it Differ Along the Field and Between Fields with Different Landscape Structure?	AGRONOMY-BASEL												In this work, we aimed to test whether taxonomic diversity and functional diversity and the values of functional traits of the weed seed bank varied across the field, from margins to the core, and between fields embedded in distinct landscape structures. We sampled the seed bank of 47 conventionally managed cereal fields from two Mediterranean regions in Spain. In each field, three positions were selected: Margin, edge and core, and soil properties were measured for each position. Landscape structure was quantified for each field as the percentage of arable land in the surrounding 1 km radius circular sector. Seed bank diversity was characterized at the taxonomic (species richness, exponential Shannon index, and evenness) and functional levels (Rao's quadratic entropy index and four corner analysis). For functional diversity, eight functional traits related to the whole plant life cycle were considered. Results showed a slight response of increasing taxonomic diversity from the core of the fields to the margins. Functional diversity was extremely low, indicating high similarity among species in terms of functional traits. Species in the seed bank were mostly therophytes, shorter than the crop plants, small seeded, flowering between the herbicide application of late winter and crop harvest, and showed seed dispersal by gravity or wind. This trait syndrome allows persistence in intensively managed arable lands. The similarity between fields in terms of functional diversity of the seed bank and in species traits may suggest that the intensity of management practices was similar across the fields. Moreover, it emphasizes that an increase in landscape heterogeneity, if based on other intensively managed cropping systems, may not be sufficient to augment functional diversity of weed communities. Therefore, in these areas, the seed bank could restore weed taxonomic diversity following changes in management practices, but functional diversity would still remain limited.

Effect of Barley Sowing Density on the Integrated Weed Management of <i>Lolium rigidum</i> (Annual Ryegrass) in Mediterranean Dryland: A Modeling Approach	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Population models are particularly helpful for understanding long-term changes in the weed dynamics associated with integrated weed management (IWM) strategies. IWM practices for controlling L. rigidum are of high importance, mainly due to its widespread resistance that precludes chemical control as a single management method. The objective of this contribution is to simulate different IWM scenarios with special emphasis on the impact of different levels of barley sowing densities on L. rigidum control. To this effect, a weed-crop population model for both L. rigidum and barley life cycles was developed. Our results point out: (i) the necessity of achieving high control efficiencies (>99%), (ii) that the increase of twice the standard sowing density of barley resulted in a reduction of 23.7% of the weed density, (iii) non-herbicide-based individual methods, such as delayed sowing and weed seed removal at harvest, proved to be inefficient for reducing drastically weed population, (iv) the implementation of at least three control tactics (seed removal, delay sowing and herbicides) is required for weed infestation eradication independently of the sowing rate, and (v) the effect of an increase in the sowing density is diluted as a more demanding weed control is reached. Future research should aim to disentangle the effect of different weed resistance levels on L. rigidum population dynamics and the required efficiencies for more sustainable IWM programs.

J	Shen, Q; Zhang, SW; Xia, K				Shen, Qiang; Zhang, Shiwen; Xia, Ke			Spectral Heterogeneity Analysis and Soil Organic Matter Inversion across Differences in Soil Types and Organic Matter Content in Dryland Farmland in China	SUSTAINABILITY												Soil organic matter (SOM) plays an important role in agricultural production and arable land quality improvement. Hyperspectral technology enables frequent surveys over large areas. In this study, we explored the spectral heterogeneity of differences in soil types and SOM content, and proposed a method for measuring SOM content in large areas using spectroscopy. The results indicate regional variations in factors affecting soil spectral absorption peaks, with noticeable latitudinal disparities. The first-order differential partial-least-squares method provided the best prediction for the SOM inversion. The coefficient of determination (R2) for the SOM inversion model was 0.93, and the root mean square error (RMSE) was 3.42, with an 8.49 g/kg difference in the SOM content. When the difference in SOM content fell between 8 and 15 g/kg, the inversion effect model performed best. The optimal model R2 exceeded 0.95, and the RMSE was less than 5. The comprehensive analysis showed that the organic matter content was an important factor affecting the SOM content estimate and must be considered in the real process. In addition, it is crucial to categorize soil samples on the basis of distinct soil types while maintaining a consistent range of SOM content within the same soil type, ideally between 8 and 15 g/kg. Subsequently, the first-order differential partial least squares method is applicable. These results are expected to contribute to the acquisition of high-quality information on variations in the SOM of complex large-scale areas.																				2071-1050				DEC	2023	15	23							16310	10.3390/su152316310	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su152316310													WOS:001116017400001

However, these interventions cannot be used in tropical drylands because rural communities lack financial resources. Spontaneous vegetation succession may help restore degraded sites. However, spontaneous succession is evaluated by only comparing species composition between degraded and reference sites, without considering the structure and function of degraded sites. Question: Can spontaneous succession restore the structure and function of sites degraded by stone quarrying? Study sites and dates: San Rafael Coxcatlan, Puebla, 2013. Methods: We evaluated nine indicators of ecosystem structure and function in 4 degraded sites abandoned for 40 years and 1 reference site. Results: Spontaneous succession partially restored the structure and function of degraded sites. In all degraded sites, herb cover (20-49 %) and biocrust cover (21-51 %) were similar to those in reference site (19 %, 56 %). Three degraded sites also had canopy covers (57-76 %), shrub covers (51-52 %), and bare ground covers (2-3 %) similar to those in reference site (80 %, 42 %, 2 %). However, one degraded site displayed the opposite pattern (32 %, 8 %, 14 %). All degraded sites had lower tree cover (0-2 %), visual obstruction (6-25 %), and litter cover (3-30 %) than the reference site (21 %, 66 %, 77 %). Conclusions: Spontaneous succession helped restore the structure and function in some degraded sites.																			2007-4298	2007-4476				JAN-MAR	2022	100	1					86	92		10.17129/botsci.2880	http://dx.doi.org/10.17129/botsci.2880													WOS:000726536000006

Seeds of four species of Thymus pubescens Boiss. & Kotschy ex Celak., Thymus daenensis Celak. Thymus daenensis subsp. lancifolius (Celak.) Jalas and Thymus kotschyanus Boiss. & Hohen. were collected from their natural habitat in Lourestan province, Iran. Seeds sown in Jiffy pots in glasshouse in September 2016 and the seedlings were transferred to the field in October 2016 using Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with 3 replications. Each unit of the experiment consists of 40 plants in two rows with 50 cm distance between rows and 50 cm between plants within rows. Data were collected for aerial parts biomass, morphological traits and essential oil percentages over two years 2017-2018. The essential oils of all samples were obtained by hydrodistillation, in flowering stage and the essential oil components were identified using gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Considerable variation was found between species for fresh and dry weight of aerial parts biomass, plant height, root length and essential oil content. The mean values of aerial parts biomass, crown diameter and essential oil in T. daenensis were higher than other species. For the root length, the higher value was obtained in T. pubescens. The lower and higher essential oil content with average values of 1.53% and 1.95% were obtained in T. pubescens and T. daenensis subsp. lancifolius, respectively. The results indicated that the major components in the essential oil were carvacrol (5.8, 18.5, 42.4 and 33.5%) and thymol (78.9, 51.9, 36.19 and 42.7%) for T. daenensis, T. kotschyanus, T. daenensis subsp. lancifolius and T. pubescens, respectively.

It is undoubtedly very important to seek a reasonable cultivation mode for the yield, quality and long-term production stability of traditional herbs. In this study, licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch.) was investigated using a field experiment and a process based model (Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model) to study the effects of mulching methods on root yield and soil organic carbon (SOC) long-term changes. The field experiment contained four treatments: plat planting without mulching (CK), ridge-furrow maize straw mulching (SM), ridge-furrow plastic film mulching (RP), and plat planting with plastic film mulching (FP). Licorice root yield was significantly higher in the SM, RP, and FP than in the CK. SM, RP and FP treatments increased the accumulation of liquiritin and glycyrrhizin in licorice roots. The SM significantly increased SOC content, SOC stocks, SOC sequestration rate, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) compared to CK, but there was no significant difference in SOC and DOC among CK, RP and FP. The DNDC model was calibrated based on the field test data and showed that under the four CMIP6 SSPs scenarios, the predicted root yield of each treatment was increasing obviously. The production and stability of RP and FP were greater than CK and SM. The SOC under SM showed an increasing trend, whereas it continuously decreased under CK, RP, and FP in the future. The SOC of simulated RS treatment of straw incorporation plus a plastic film mulch was always at the highest value in all the treatments, and its root yield was slightly lower than that of RP and FP, the latter both were very close. Therefore, it is suggested that RS should be adopted to achieve sustained high yield while maintaining a high SOC level.

Sammi			Regional scale cropping systems management options in Telangana using WorldClim data	JOURNAL OF AGROMETEOROLOGY												The present study evaluates the existing district-wise cropping system of Kharif and Rabi season prevailing in Telangana State of India. In kharif season, it was observed that all districts of the states are water surplus and whereas during Rabi season all districts become water deficit. In order to enhance the agricultural production and agricultural based rural economy, alternate cropping system were suggested. Due consideration was given to the existing water resource and farming practices prevailing in the respective district. Re-appropriation of area under various crops was suggested for two scenarios namely, 'A' and 'B', aimed for reduction in crop water requirement by 10 % and 20 %, respectively. In scenario 'A', it was suggested to reduce the area under transplanted paddy and ground nut by half and 40% respectively,in kharif season and substantial enhancement in the area under redgram. For rabi season the area under transplanted paddy could be reduced to half for scope to double the area under oilseed. The scenario 'B' however is feasible in 3 districts, suggests restricting the area under groundnut to comprehensive increase in pulse area. For rabi in scenario 'B', it is recommended to further reduce the area under oilseed, paddy and other crops allows more crop diversity including millets, sorghum and caster. The economic analysis suggested that the alternate scenario has the potential to significantly improve the benefit cost ratio apart from enhancement in water productivity.

The five treatments were no return of straw residues (CK), straw incorporated evenly into the soil using the crashing-ridging technique (EIS), straw mulching (SM), straw plowed into the soil (SP), and straw returned in granulated form (SG). Relative to the no straw return, EIS effectively reduced soil bulk density and penetration resistance, increased soil total organic carbon (TOC), macroaggregate-associated carbon content, and the accumulation of soil humus. Furthermore, EIS improved soil structure and soil aggregate stability and significantly increased the soil quality index. Among the various straw returning treatments, SM and SG significantly promoted soil macroaggregation and increased macroaggregate-associated carbon content by 23.69% and 21.70% at the soil surface, respectively (as compared with the control). Compared to SM, SP, and SG, EIS significantly enhanced the aliphaticity and hydrophobicity of soil organic carbon. These results suggested that EIS was the most efficient straw return mode to increase TOC and improve soil structure and fertility.						fan, wei/0000-0003-0012-118X														2071-1050				APR	2020	12	7							2631	10.3390/su12072631	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12072631													WOS:000531558100056

Wildfires are becoming more frequent and severe, threatening the sustainability of local ecosystems. Arachnids respond markedly to environmental modifications and can regulate processes linked to lower trophic levels. Assessing changes in arachnid diversity is useful to understand the effect of fire on animal assemblages and ecosystem functionality. The aim of this study was to analyze the response of the ground-dwelling arachnid assemblage to fire disturbance. Eight sampling sites were selected: four burned and four unburned. Arachnids were sampled using pitfall traps. The taxonomic and functional structure of the assemblage was found to differ between burned and unburned areas. This change was related to major taxa turnover. On the other hand, the alpha diversity did not differ significantly according to fire disturbance. The abundance of specialist spiders decreased significantly in burned areas, possibly related to post-fire changes in the composition and structure of the plant community. In addition, significant species indicators of unburned and burned sites were found. The results of this study are useful for ecosystem management and the development of biodiversity conservation strategies in northeastern Patagonia, an area severely affected by fires.

Combined application of nitrogen and phosphorus to enhance nitrogen use efficiency and close the wheat yield gap on varying soils in semi-arid conditions	JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE												A primary driver of the wheat yield gap in Australia and globally is the supply of nitrogen (N) and options to increase N use efficiency (NUE) are fundamental to closure of the yield gap. Co-application of N with phosphorus (P) is suggested as an avenue to increase fertiliser NUE, and inputs of N and P fertiliser are key variable costs in low rainfall cereal crops. Within field variability in the response to nutrients due to soil and season offers a further opportunity to refine inputs for increased efficiency. The response of wheat to N fertiliser input (0, 10, 20, 40 and 80 kg N ha(-1)) under four levels of P fertiliser (0, 5, 10 and 20 kg P ha(-1)) was measured on three key low rainfall cropping soils (dune, mid-slope and swale) across a dune-swale system in a low rainfall semi-arid environment in South Australia, for three successive cropping seasons. Wheat on sandy soils produced significant and linear yield and protein responses across all three seasons, while wheat on a clay loam only produced a yield response in a high rainfall season. Responses to P fertiliser were measured on the sandy soils but more variable in nature and a consistent effect of increased P nutrition leading to increased NUE was not measured.

Supervised trials on open field strawberries were concluded using the authorised and more critical agricultural practices. Residues were measured at several PHIs using an LC-MS/MS methodology with an extraction procedure based on the QuEChERS protocol. The method was successfully validated with an LOQ of 0.001 mg kg(-1).

Grassland productivity responds unexpectedly to dynamic light and soil water environments induced by photovoltaic arrays	ECOSPHERE												Agrivoltaic (AV) systems are designed to coproduce photovoltaic (PV) energy on lands simultaneously supporting agriculture (food/forage production). PV infrastructure in agroecosystems alters resources critical for plant growth, and water-limited agroecosystems such as grasslands are likely to be particularly sensitive to the unique spatial and temporal patterns of incident sunlight and soil water inherent within AV systems. However, the impact of resource alteration on forage production, the primary ecosystem service from managed grasslands, is poorly resolved. Here, we evaluated seasonal patterns of soil moisture (SM) and diurnal variation in incident sunlight (photosynthetic photon flux density [PPFD]) in a single-axis-tracking AV system established in a formerly managed semiarid C-3 grassland in Colorado. Our goals were to (1) quantify dynamic patterns of PPFD and SM within a 1.2 MW PV array in a perennial grassland, and (2) determine how aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and photosynthetic parameters responded to the resource patterns created by the PV array. We hypothesized that spatial variability in ANPP would be strongly related to SM patterns, typical of most grasslands. We measured significant reductions in ANPP directly beneath PV panels, where SM and PPFD were both low. However, in locations with significantly increased SM from the shedding and redistribution of precipitation by PV panels, ANPP was not increased. Instead, ANPP was greatest in locations where plants were shaded in the afternoon but received high levels of PPFD in the morning hours, when air temperatures and vapor pressure deficits were relatively low. Thus, contrary to expectations, we found relatively weak relationships between SM and ANPP despite significant spatial variability in both. Further, there was little evidence that light-saturated photosynthesis (A(sat)) and quantum yield of CO2 assimilation (phi CO2) differed for plants growing directly beneath (lowest PPFD) versus between (highest PPFD) PV panels. Overall, the AV system established in this semiarid managed grassland did not alter patterns of ANPP in ways predictable from past studies of controls of ANPP in open grasslands. However, our results suggest that the diurnal timing of low versus high periods of PPFD incident on plants is an important determinant of productivity patterns in grasslands.

We investigated the biomass accumulation, regrowth biomass, and nutritive value of sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea) in response to initial harvest day and cutting height in irrigated and dryland studies in Wyoming. Net biomass accumulations in 105-day growing period were 4.4 tons acre(-1) under irrigation and 0.7 tons acre(-1) in dryland conditions. Initial harvest day after planting (iDAP) affected initial and regrowth biomass accumulation but did not affect net biomass accumulation in irrigated or dryland studies. Regrowth and net biomass accumulations were affected by cutting height in the irrigated study only. Nutritive value concentrations were significantly affected by iDAP in both irrigated and dryland studies. Under irrigation, net nutrient accumulation was not affected by iDAP but was significantly greater with a cutting height of 4.2 inches compared to 2.5- and 6-inch heights. In contrast, the dryland study, net nutrient accumulation was not affected by cutting height but was higher in 55-105 iDAP than 45 iDAP. In the irrigated study, a cutting height of 4.2 inches produced net accumulations higher in both biomass accumulation and nutritive value. In the dryland study a harvest time of 55-105 iDAP produced the highest net accumulation regardless of harvest time or cutting height. Sunn hemp can be harvested once or twice in a 105-day growing season to produce biomass and essential nutrients for livestock feeding.

Development of a Chopping Apparatus for Cactus Prickly Cladodes	AMA-AGRICULTURAL MECHANIZATION IN ASIA AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA												Either under proper cultivation and growing in the wild, cactus prickly represents an important source to feed livestock. When properly cultivated, around 10 t/ ha per year of fresh biomass is produced just from pruning. However, when the biomass is left over the soil it slowly degrades and fertilizes cactus prickly orchards, in contrast, when unattended it contributes to generate pests and diseases. A profitable alternative is to utilize this cactus prickly pruning to feed livestock, by mixing and balancing it with some locally feeds such as mesquite pod and hay from alfalfa. Thus this work shows the development an apparatus for continuously chopping cactus prickly cladodes; firstly by cutting strips and ended into small cubes. The apparatus is simple to handle, inexpensive and with the capacity of processing up to 10 t/h; besides it provides a profitable choice for an underutilized resource in a region with shortage of feeds for livestock					Durán-García, Héctor Martín/IWD-7187-2023	Durán-García, Héctor Martín/0000-0003-0285-4053													0084-5841					SUM	2019	50	3					58	61																WOS:000491216300009

Fields under Dryland Conditions	AGRICULTURE-BASEL												Knowledge of the characteristics of N2O emissions and the influential mechanism is of great significance to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in semi-arid areas. In the present study, a three-year water-control study was conducted; three simulated rainfall amounts (heavy, normal, and light rainfall = 275, 200, and 125 mm, respectively), two wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) planting modes (RF (ridge-furrow mulching system) and TF (traditional flat planting)) and four supplementary irrigation amounts (150, 75, 37.5, and 0 mm) were set up. The effects of different cultivation methods and irrigation amounts on soil N2O emissions, the soil water content, available nitrogen content, and denitrifying enzyme activity were investigated to clarify the N2O emission mechanism in winter wheat fields (Triticum aestivum L.). The results obtained after three years showed that compared with TF, the N2O emissions under RF decreased by 21.62-30.72% (p < 0.001), whereas the soil water content increased by 6.26-8.82%, the available nitrogen content decreased by 1.71-16.24%, and the denitrifying enzyme activities increased by 0.2-24.16% under heavy rainfall conditions. Under conditions with normal and light rainfall, the N2O emission fluxes under RF increased by 3.66-12.46% and 6.08-15.57% (p > 0.05), while the soil water contents increased by 6.13-11.49% and 8.05-13.88%, the soil available nitrogen contents decreased by 11.0-21.42% and 19.93-34.44%, and the denitrifying enzyme activities increased by 0.01-24.08% and 0.03-20.79% compared with TF. Principal component analysis showed that the main factors related to N2O emissions under RF were the soil moisture content and available nitrogen content; these factors combined explained 94.37% the variation of the N2O emissions. However, the main factors under TF were the soil moisture content and denitrifying enzyme activity; these factors combined explained 85.81%. In the heavy and normal rainfall years, compared with TF, using RF and 75 mm irrigation achieved the goal of reducing water usage as well as decreasing the N2O emissions (or N2O increase was not significant). In light rainfall years, RF with 150 mm irrigation obtained significant reductions in water usage compared with TF but it also increased the N2O emission flux. Under different rainfall years, the yield of RF increased by 2.89-50.44% compared with the TF system, and the increase in wheat grain yield increased with decreasing rainfall.

Increased Dependence on Irrigated Crop Production Across the CONUS (1945-2015)	WATER												Efficient irrigation technologies, which seem to promise reduced production costs and water consumption in heavily irrigated areas, may instead be driving increased irrigation use in areas that were not traditionally irrigated. As a result, the total dependence on supplemental irrigation for crop production and revenue is steadily increasing across the contiguous United States. Quantifying this dependence has been hampered by a lack of comprehensive irrigated and dryland yield and harvested area data outside of major irrigated regions, despite the importance and long history of irrigation applications in agriculture. This study used a linear regression model to disaggregate lumped agricultural statistics and estimate average irrigated and dryland yields at the state level for five major row crops: corn, cotton, hay, soybeans, and wheat. For 1945-2015, we quantified crop production, irrigation enhancement revenue, and irrigated and dryland areas in both intensively irrigated and marginally-dependent states, where both irrigated and dryland farming practices are implemented. In 2015, we found that irrigating just the five commodity crops enhanced revenue by $7 billion across all states with irrigation. In states with both irrigated and dryland practices, 23% of total produced area relied on irrigation, resulting in 7% more production than from dryland practices. There was a clear response to increasing biofuel demand, with the addition of more than 3.6 million ha of irrigated corn and soybeans in the last decade in marginally-dependent states. Since 1945, we estimate that yield enhancement due to irrigation has resulted in over $465 billion in increased revenue across the contiguous United States (CONUS). Example applications of this dataset include estimating historical water use, evaluating the effects of environmental policies, developing new resource management strategies, economic risk analyses, and developing tools for farmer decision making.

Vegetation-memory effects and their association with vegetation resilience in global drylands	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Vegetation memory describes the effect of antecedent environmental and ecological conditions on the present ecosystem state and has been proposed as an important proxy for vegetation resilience. In particular, strong vegetation memory has been identified in dryland regions, but the factors underlying the spatial patterns of vegetation memory remain unknown. We aim to map the components and drivers of vegetation memory in dryland regions using state-of-the-art climate reanalysis data and refined approaches to identify vegetation-memory characteristics across dryland regions worldwide. Using a framework which distinguishes between intrinsic and extrinsic ecological memory, we show that (i) intrinsic memory is a much stronger component than extrinsic memory in the majority of dryland regions and (ii) climate reanalysis datasets change the detection of extrinsic vegetation memory in some global dryland regions. Synthesis. Our study offers a global picture of the vegetation response to two climate variables using satellite data, information which is potentially relevant for mapping components and properties of vegetation responses worldwide. However, the large differences in the spatial patterns in intrinsic vegetation memory in our study compared to previous analyses show the overall sensitivity of this component to the initial choice of extrinsic predictor variables. As a result, we caution against using the oversimplified link between intrinsic vegetation-memory and vegetation recovery rates at large spatial scales.

However, smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa engage in irrigation in diverse locations under different organizational modalities. This research analyses a flexible and dynamic form of irrigation driven by unique partnerships between migrants and local actors who derive benefits from land and water resources along a sand river. The case study of the ephemeral Olkeriai sand river in Kajiado, Kenya, was based on a baseline survey of 107 farm plots and 23 in-depth interviews with farmers. We found that 75% of the farm plots were managed under transient farming partnerships between migrant farmers and capital providers, locally known as tajiris, who leased land from local landowners to grow high-value market crops. These partnerships are based on flexible agreements between the actors and the frequent need to review and re-build them creates a fertile ground for new entrepreneurial players from within and outside the area, playing a key role in accelerating irrigation intensification and expansion. However, these irrigation ventures are not always successful. Unreliable partners, unstable market channels and increasing costs of irrigation inputs frequently result in farm losses and breaking up of partnership ventures. Furthermore, the lack of collective action among various resource users at the catchment level raises questions on how to sustainably manage the natural resources in sand rivers.					van der Zaag, Pieter/B-8247-2008														0378-3774	1873-2283				MAY 1	2022	265								107526	10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107526	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107526		FEB 2022											WOS:000792801600001

Dryland continental mudstones: Deciphering environmental changes in problematic mudstones from the Upper Triassic (Carnian to Norian) Mercia Mudstone Group, south-west Britain	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The sedimentology, petrography and mineralogy of the seemingly monotonous Late Triassic Mercia Mudstone Group across the Severn Basin and Bristol Channel region reveals a bipartite division of mudrock facies above and below the Arden Sandstone Formation. Frequently cryptic sedimentary and pedogenic features reveal diverse alluvial, aeolian, playa-lacustrine and pedogenic processes operating at different times, locations and scales probably in response to climate change. The current study found no evidence of significant marine influence in either of the two mudrock facies associations that are described here. Blocky claystones dominate the lower Mercia Mudstone Group (Sidmouth Mudstone Formation), with pedogenic features such as slickensides, mottling, tubules and carbonate/sulphate nodules common and widespread. The claystones are of alluvial/lacustrine origin with subordinate sheet sandstones, themselves overprinted by pedogenic features, reflecting occasional high intensity rainfall events. These facies reflect a seasonal (wet/dry) semi-arid climate favouring development of transformed/neoformed (smectite-rich) clay minerals of intrabasinal origin. Massive to weakly stratified silty mudstones dominate the upper Mercia Mudstone Group (Branscombe Mudstone Formation). Commonly conchoidally weathered, locally gypsiferous, but with distinct sedimentary structures scarce, they alternate with subordinate blue-grey laminated silty mudstones. Together they reflect fluctuating hydrological conditions within extensive saline mudflats and ephemeral playa lakes, with laminated facies deposited under subaqueous conditions during more humid phases whereas massive mudstones reflect modification through interstitial growth/dissolution of sulphates and deflation of surface sediments during drier episodes. These facies reflect increased aridity during deposition of the upper Mercia Mudstone Group compared with the lower Mercia Mudstone Group, favouring development of detrital/transformed (illite-chlorite) clay minerals of extrabasinal origin. The described facies associations and the sedimentary fabrics and structures that characterize them, occur widely in the Mercia Mudstone Group across the United Kingdom and comparable facies associations may be anticipated in other fine-grained red bed successions. Recognition of these facies may aid palaeoenvironmental interpretation of such sequences on Earth and, potentially, on Mars also.																			0037-0746	1365-3091				DEC	2019	66	7					2557	2589		10.1111/sed.12626	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sed.12626		AUG 2019											WOS:000480931700001
J	Montilla, P; Torres, L				Montilla, Pablo; Torres, Laura			Territorializing capital by deterritorializing rural areas. Territorial consequences associated with land use changes in the Antinaco - Los Colorados Valley, La Rioja, Argentina	I2 INVESTIGACION E INNOVACION EN ARQUITECTURA Y TERRITORIO												In Haesbaert's (2004)view there is no way to define the individual, the group, the community, the society, outside the geographic-territorial context that contains them. The subjects produce their own territories, in such a way that their modification opens up an uncertain path in which the processes of dispossession, alienation of the place and destruction of the territorialities life-sustaining converge, coordinate with and feed back on each other. The stories of some farmers in Vichigasta, La Rioja, Argentina, show with great clarity, how these dynamics affect their social reproduction. They express profound helplessness in the face of the impossibility to slow down the expansion of business activities that have a different logic from that of the peasantry, and thus far have not been able to achieve results in their struggles in accordance with their expectations. The creation of a natural reserve appears as a possibility of safeguard and barrier against the expansive advance of capital. A renewed way, although not free from contradictions, of valuing the natural heritage as a provider of ecological services and goods, and even emerges as a space to contribute to land management by and for the Vichigasta community. The present work advances with agricultural growth trends analysis in the last 30 years in the area and describes the tensions generated as a consequence. It then analyzes the deterritorialization processes under way and recovers farmers' views regarding current territorial trends.																				2341-0515				FEB	2021	9	1					59	78		10.14198/i2.2021.9.1.04	http://dx.doi.org/10.14198/i2.2021.9.1.04													WOS:000799006000004
J	Barker, G				Barker, Graeme			Living with risk in drylands: Archaeological perspectives	HOLOCENE												This paper reflects on the themes illustrated in the 11 case studies on the archaeology of drylands. The papers emphasise the diversity of dryland forms, and of the landscapes within them, the implications of this diversity for the societies living in them, and the need to integrate palaeoenvironmental and archaeological approaches in their study. These studies recognise that how past dryland societies recognised risks and opportunities in drylands, including at times of ecological change (whether climatic and/or anthropogenic) may have been very different from our own notions of post-Enlightenment rationality. They provide examples of very different responses to aridification including: abandoning places and lifeways; specialising in alternative rhythms of life and resources; diversifying and broadening the subsistence base to spread risk; and applying new technological and social solutions to make drylands easier to live in. Whilst emphasising the challenges in both theoretical frameworks and methodologies if we are to better understand the interplay between ecological and social drivers of dryland histories, importantly they demonstrates the capacity of dryland peoples to take both wise and foolish decisions in relation to their own survival and to the sustainability of the natural resource, often with implications for their neighbours. These are lessons that resonate with the pressures on drylands and dryland peoples today.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				DEC	2022	32	12			SI		1530	1534		10.1177/09596836221122630	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836221122630		SEP 2022											WOS:000854608100001
J	Schillinger, WF				Schillinger, William F.			New winter crops and rotations for the Pacific Northwest low-precipitation drylands	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												This article is an overview of recent advances in dryland cropping in the region of the Inland Pacific Northwest of the United States (PNW) that receives <300 mm annual precipitation. The climate of the region is Mediterranean-like with wet winters and dry summers. For the past 130 yr, monocrop 2-yr winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow (WW-F) has been the dominant rotation practiced on >90% of rainfed cropland throughout this region. Rapid advances in technology in the past several decades and the realities of dryland farm economics prompted most farmers to expand their land area and adopt conservation tillage and no-tillage practices. Three relatively new crops have gained some foothold in the past decade. These crops are winter pea (WP) (Pisum sativum L.), winter canola (WC) (Brassica napus L.), and winter triticale (WT) (X Triticosecale Wittmack). Like WW, all three of these "new" winter crops need to be planted in late August-early September into carryover soil moisture after a 13- to 14-mo fallow period to achieve optimum yield potential. Researchers and farmers have experimented with a multitude of spring-planted crops but, to date, all have shown high year-to-year variability in yield and none have been economically viable in the long term. The focus of this paper is to summarize major research conducted on WP, WC, and WT, as well as farmers' attitudes on the potential of these three winter crops for wheat-based rotations in the PNW drylands.

Aaron; Papanicolaou, Athanasios			Local effects of climate change on row crop production and irrigation adoption	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT												Global climate change will affect crop productivity, technology adoption, and commodity food and fiber prices. This research investigates the ex-ante effects of climate change on cropping mix and irrigation decisions at a watershed scale by integrating a downscaled General Circulation Model (GCM) projections, a crop growth model, and an economic model of the row crop sector typical of corn, soybean, wheat, and sorghum operations in Tennessee, United States. The downscaled GCM is used to generate weather patterns for Tennessee's watersheds to 2049, under moderate and high greenhouse gas (GHG) emission assumptions. Crop yields and commodity prices were also estimated under these prevailing climate scenarios. Compared with the moderate emission level scenario, greater GHG emissions decrease dryland crop productivity and cause commodity prices to trend upward. A row crop optimization model was developed under the assumption that producers are profit maximizers who base their cropping decisions on the previous yield performance of a cropping system, commodity prices, and production functions, subject to resource constrains. Results suggest that producers in some watersheds adopt irrigation to minimize variability in net returns if water is available. Dryland and irrigated soybeans, dryland corn, and dryland soybean-wheat double cropping could become the dominant cropping systems in watersheds located in western Tennessee while irrigated and dryland soybeans could become the dominant row crop in watersheds located in middle Tennessee.

The plastic film residue and overuse of chemical fertilizer cause a serious non-point source pollution and high production input cost. With mulching, farmers typically attempt to maintain the balance of soil nutrients and reduce fertilizer use while ensuring high yields. Straw strip mulching (SM) is a new mulching technique, but the effects on nutrient uptake have not been studied yet. Therefore, 19 field comparative experiments were conducted in four growth seasons of winter wheat with three mulching treatments: (1) straw strip mulch (SM), a partial ground mulching using whole corn stalks that alternate with planting strips without mulch; (2) full-field plastic film mulching (PM); and (3) no mulching with wheat sown in rows, as a control (CK). Compared with CK, on average over all experiments, SM increased grain yield by 11.5%, biomass by 19.0%, the total aboveground uptakes of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) by 16.1%, 18.4% and 22.9%. There were no significant differences between SM and CK in N and P requirements, the N, P and K concentrations in grain. The increased total aboveground uptake of each nutrient was closely associated with higher biomass, grain yield and straw yield (r = 0.66-0.84, P < 0.01). Relative to CK, SM significantly decreased the total accumulation of residual NO3-N in the top 100 cm at maturity stage by 32.3% (22.7 kg ha(-1)) in typical fertilization (N, 120 kg ha(-1); P2O5, 90 kg ha(-1)) and by 33.8% (45.8 kg ha(-1)) in high fertilization (N, 150 kg ha(-1); P2O5, 120 kg ha(-1)), and the leaching of NO3-N into the deep soil below 40 cm. When only grain nutrients exported from the field after harvest in typical fertilization, N balance in SM, PM and CK accounted for 43.8%, 38.5% and 48.6% of N input, while P balance for 74.8%, 74.0% and 78.4% of P input, respectively, indicating possible saving potentials in fertilizer costs for all treatment, but the saving potential of P is much greater than that of N. Relative to PM, SM had similar the total aboveground nutrients uptake, similar to or slightly less grain yields, and higher economic benefit. SM is suitable for popularizing in a semiarid rainfed agroecosystem.																			0167-8809	1873-2305				MAR 1	2022	326								107797	10.1016/j.agee.2021.107797	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2021.107797													WOS:000790336700007

In the Songnen Plain, northeastern China, 720 soil samples were collected from five different soil layers (0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, and 80-100 cm) in shelterbelt poplar forests and neighboring farmlands. Soil physiochemical properties [pH, electrical conductivity (EC), soil porosity, soil moisture and bulk density], soil carbon and nutrients [soil organic carbon (SOC), N, alkaline-hydrolyzed N, P, available P, K and available K], forest characteristics [tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH), and density], climatic conditions [mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), and aridity index (ARID)], and soil texture (percentage of silt, clay, and sand) were measured. We found that the effects of shelterbelt afforestation on bulk density, porosity, available K, and total P were observed up to 100 cm deep; while the changes in available K and P were several-fold higher in the 0-20 cm soil layer than that in deeper layers (p < 0.05). For other parameters (soil pH and EC), shelterbelt-influences were mainly observed in surface soils, e.g., EC was 14.7% lower in shelterbelt plantations than that in farmlands in the 0-20 cm layer, about 2.5-3.5-fold higher than 60-100 cm soil inclusion. For soil moisture, shelterbelt afforestation decreased soil water by 7.3-8.7% in deep soils (p < 0.05), while no significant change was in 0-20 cm soil. For SOC and N, no significant differences between shelterbelt and farmlands were found in all five-depth soil profiles. Large inter-site variations were found for all shelterbelt-induced soil changes (p < 0.05) except for total K in the 0-20 cm layer. MAT and silt content provided the greatest explanation powers for inter-site variations in shelterbelt-induced soil properties changes. However, in deeper soils, water (ARID and MAP) explained more of the variation than that in surface soils. Therefore, shelterbelt afforestation in northeastern China could affect aspects of soil properties down to 100 cm deep, with inter-site variations mainly controlled by climate and soil texture, and greater contribution from water characteristics in deeper soils.					wang, wenjie/G-9041-2014	wang, wenjie/0000-0003-0465-686X													1664-462X					MAR 5	2019	10								220	10.3389/fpls.2019.00220	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2019.00220								30899268					WOS:000460328000001

This study finds that indirect impacts to surrounding drylands are more than ten times greater than direct impacts and that such impacted areas contain almost 60% of threatened species globally. Urban regions across the world have expanded rapidly in recent decades, affecting fragile natural habitats, including in drylands, and threatening the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goal 15, 'life on land'. Yet, few studies have comprehensively investigated impacts of urban expansion on natural dryland habitats globally even though these cover 40% of global land area and provide habitats for 28% of endangered species. Here, we quantify at multiple scales the loss of habitat quality directly and indirectly caused by dryland urban expansion. Direct impacts are conversions of natural habitats to urban land. We define indirect impacts as proximate impacts within 10 km around the expanded urban land footprint. We found that although urban expansion from 1992 to 2016 resulted in an average 0.8% loss of dryland habitat quality, the indirect impacts were 10-15 times greater. By considering the coincidence of habitat-quality loss and threatened species ranges, we found that, globally, nearly 60% of threatened species were affected by such indirect impacts of dryland urban expansion. Our findings suggest that strategic management is imperative to mitigate the substantial impacts of dryland urban expansion on biodiversity.

A case study in a Mediterranean Dryland	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Poor reforestation outcomes imply failure to fulfill program goals and tend to erode institutional willpower and political momentum towards reforestation efforts, affecting both public and private support. However, program improvement in real reforestation projects is challenging, due to the conjunction of many different variables that mutually interact and feed back on each other inextricably. This study develops a comprehensive assessment framework for reforestation programs, for which technical and environmental information is gathered and related to indicators of performance in both the short- and mid-term. This assessment, tested on a case study, aimed to provide reliable end-results for survival and growth, revealed pitfalls in successful plantation establishment and taught us how to improve plantation performance and what the margin for this improvement was. The selected project was carried out on harsh site conditions, with different species, cultivation treatments and contractors, and was affected by the driest year on record. Plantation mortality was high and increased progressively over time, particularly in the short-term when the rate was 53% (rising to 83% after ten years), showing high variation between sites and species (Pinus pinaster and Quercus faginea died more than 94% after ten years while Junipus phoenicea only 40%). All the hardwoods and the juniper showed lower growth rate after ten years (average stem volume < 40 cm(3)) than pines (stem volume > 470 cm(3)). Technical variables (project planning and execution) had a relatively important impact on plantation performance in the first two years (11-29%), but decreased with time, whilst environmental variables (site and meteorological) were more important ten years after planting (>50%). In the short-term, soil moisture and meteorology during the planting season were identified as key factors that triggered the effects of both technical decisions (planting date and planting technique) and other environmental variables on performance. In the design phase, some decisions related to zoning, species selection and cultural treatments were related to poor performance. The results provide practical information and guidelines about all potential drivers of plantation performance and contribute to identify those aspects more related to success of forest restoration in Mediterranean drylands.

The snowstorms of the year 2009 caused financial damage worth of 2,516 million RMB. This study examines the dynamical features and the moisture sources associated with wintertime extreme precipitation over the B-J region. The analyses are based primarily on the data set from ERA-Interim during DJF 1979-2017. Both Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches are used to examine the moisture sources. An upper-tropospheric Rossby wave train that extends from the North Atlantic Ocean to the B-J region is found to play a leading role in the formation of 127 wintertime extreme precipitation events in the B-J region. This Rossby wave train deepens a cyclonic anomaly in the lower troposphere over the B-J region, which favors the development of strong southwesterly moisture transport and strong updrafts there. These conditions are favorable for the occurrence of extreme precipitation events over the B-J region. Lagrangian moisture source analysis indicates that most of the moisture for precipitation during these events comes from terrestrial sources, with central Asia the key moisture source region. The Eulerian moisture budget analysis further shows that most of the moisture for extreme precipitation enters the B-J region through its western boundary via enhanced southwesterly flow. These dynamical and moisture source analyses establish a set of valuable precursor conditions for predicting wintertime extreme precipitation events over the B-J region.

The machine learning-based methods produced greater accuracy than the Jarvis-type model in predicting gs from leaf age, atmospheric [CO2], photosynthetically active radiation, vapour pressure deficit, temperature, time of day, and soil water availability (i.e. phenological and environmental variables determining gs). The R-2 was 0.76 for the Jarvis-type but 0.92 for SVM and 0.97 for RF machine learning-based models, with a calculated RMSE of 0.292 mol m(-2) s(-1) in the Jarvis-type compared to 0.129 mol m(-2) s(-1) in SVM and 0.081 mol m(-2) s(-1) in RF. The machine learning models, however, needed large datasets for training to achieve statistical significance, and do not offer the same opportunity to provide physiological insights through a statistically testable hypothesis. These results show that using the machine-learning based methods can achieve high prediction accuracy of gs that is especially important when incorporated into larger models, but their ability to extrapolate beyond observed data ranges will need to be assessed before they could be considered in place of the physical model.

Assessing the prevalence of veterinary antibiotics and associated potential ecological risk in dryland soil, manure, and compost: A case study from Saudi Arabia	JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY SCIENCE												Application of manure and compost can result in the accumulation of veterinary antibiotics in soil, subsequently posing ecological risks. The occurrence and potential ecological risk assessment of nine antibiotics (4 tetracyclines, 3 sulfonamides, and 2 macrolides) residues in soil, manure, and compost samples collected from Al-Kharj, Saudi Arabia are reported in this study. A total of 36 samples (20 soil, 8 manure, and 8 compost) were collected and their physiochemical characteristics were analyzed. Large variabilities were observed in organic matter, pH, electrical conductivity, and nutrient status. In the soil samples obtained, three textural groups were identified: sandy loam, loamy sand, and loam. Overall, the mean concentrations of all detected antibiotics measured were lower (<50 mu g kg(-1)) in all matrices (soil, manure, and compost). However, the mean concentrations of tetracycline (TC), doxycycline (DC), oxytetracycline (OT), and sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) were 97.96, 183.29, 101.24, and 69.58 mu g kg(-1), respectively, in manure samples, and 49.59, 93.26, 74.21, and 18.32 mu g kg(-1), respectively, in compost samples. The concentrations of antibiotics were highest in manure samples, then compost, and finally soil. The calculated risk quotient (RQ) values for the majority of the studied antibiotics were <0.1, indicating no to low adverse ecological effects. However, the higher RQ values for OT and DC suggested possible adverse ecological effects of these compounds in soil. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Warming as a Driver of Vegetation Loss in the Sonoran Desert of California	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Dryland ecosystems cover large regions of the Earth and have important impacts on global biogeochemistry and the carbon cycle. The plant species that occupy dryland environments have traits that enable them to withstand harsh environmental conditions, and some researchers have hypothesized that dryland vegetation may be comparatively resilient to changing climate, while others have pointed out that dryland vegetation often operates close to the physiological limits of many species, implying a possible vulnerability to warming. Here we use the Landsat archive to analyze vegetation dynamics for part of the Sonoran Desert and adjacent mountains in southern California. We show that large decreases in vegetation cover occurred over the last 34 years (1984-2017), especially across the xeric portions of our study region, where we observed a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) decline of 1.1 +/- 0.3% yr(-1). Changes in precipitation explain most of the year-to-year variation but are unable to fully explain the observed long-term decline in NDVI. Statistical models that combined summer temperature and mean annual precipitation explained more of the spatial and temporal structure of NDVI trends and implicate climate warming as an important driver of declining vegetation cover. The impact of warming contributed to a change in the precipitation-vegetation relationship through time for this desert region, indicating a structural change in ecosystem function during the study period. These results suggest that recent climate change has already had significant impact on these drylands and highlight the potential for future warming to increase risks for dryland ecosystems in other regions.

In the drylands, it is further complicated by weather-related risks and resource degradation. In this paper, we present a case study of the mixed crop-livestock production system in Jordan. To better capture the nature of response farming in the drylands, we develop a methodology for using crop simulation models to directly generate data for optimizing production practices of an integrated crop-livestock producing household in a dynamic stochastic context. The approach optimizes producer's adaptations to random events, such as weather, which are realized throughout the planning horizon. To ensure the sustainability of the optimized production decisions, long-term valuations of end of horizon soil attributes are included in the objective function. This approach endogenizes the tradeoff between short-and long-run productivity. Model results show that due to the limited natural resource endowments and financial liquidity constraints of the typical farm households in the study area, we find these households have limited options. To optimally respond to weather conditions during the production season, better manage risk, and achieve improvements in soil attributes, a typical household would need larger farm size, larger flock, and better financial liquidity than it currently commands. Like all such models, the farm household model used in this paper is not suitable for drawing policy implications. Therefore, targeted analysis using appropriate sectoral or economy-wide models will be needed in the future to identify and test the efficacy of different policy and institutional interventions including land consolidation, establishment of producer and marketing cooperatives, access to financial services including agricultural credit, and crop insurance in expanding the resource base of farmers-thereby positioning them for higher earnings, ensuring soil conservation, and enhancing the sustainability of the production system.

The research was carried out to characterize the entomopathogenic fungi diversity associated with different agroecosystem on a different location in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Fungi of rice field ecosystems were found more diverse than on dryland ecosystems, and the genus was Fusarium species, Aspergillus species, Rhizopus species, Trichoderma species, Penicillium species, Rhizoctonia species and Metharizium species. Moreover, Fusarium species and Rhizopus species were the most frequent genus isolated from rice field ecosystem, while on dryland ecosystems, the fungus of Metharizium species found more frequent than Fusarium species and Aspergillus species According to a geographical location on rice field ecosystems. The number of fungi isolated on the regency of Gowa more numerous than regency of Sidrap, Takalar, and Pinrang. Meanwhile, on the dryland ecosystems, three locations were the city of Makassar, the regency of Maros, and the regency of Polman. Among three areas, the regency of Maros founded more fungi than regency of Polman and Makassar. This study exhibits the diversity of fungi on the rice field, and dryland ecosystems were quite different.

For that purpose, an experiment was carried out in areas of the UBPC "El Sordo", municipality Marti, Matanzas. Three treatments were studied: control (the watering was applied to indicate the Technical Handbook for the cultivation of chickpea on the Cuba conditions), unirrigated conditions and unirrigated + Trichoderma sp. At the moment of harvest, it was determined the number of legumes per plant, number of empty legumes per plants, number of seeds per legumes, number of seeds per plant, weight of 100 seeds (g) and yield (t ha-1). A total randomize design was used and data was processed with the statistic software STATGRAPHIC plus 5.1. The analyzed treatments affected the yield and their attributes on chickpea, variety JP 94. Control (with watering) showed the best response. The application of TRICOSAVE 34 based on Trichoderma harzianum strain A-34 unirrigated, did not increased the yield parameters evaluated.																			0253-5785	2072-2001				APR-JUN	2021	48	2					24	30																WOS:000681329000003

The rotational speed of each turbine rotor (diameter: D = 50 mm) varies based on the equation of motion. First, the dependence of rotor performance on the gap distance (gap) between two rotors is investigated. For parallel layouts, counter-down (CD) layouts with blades moving downwind in the gap region yield a higher mean power than counter-up (CU) layouts with blades moving upwind in the gap region. CD layouts with gap/D = 0.5-1.0 yield a maximum average power that is 23% higher than that of an isolated single rotor. Assuming isotropic bidirectional wind speed, co-rotating (CO) layouts with the same rotational direction are superior to the combination of CD and CU layouts regardless of the gap distance. For tandem layouts, the inverse-rotation (IR) configuration shows an earlier wake recovery than the CO configuration. For 16-wind-direction layouts, both the IR and CO configurations indicate similar power distribution at gap/D = 2.0. For the first time, this study demonstrates the phase synchronization of two rotors via numerical simulation.

J	de Waal, J; Miller, J; van Niekerk, A				de Waal, Jan; Miller, Jodie; van Niekerk, Adriaan			The impact of agricultural transformation on water quality in a data-scarce, dryland landscape-a case study in the Bot River, South Africa	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Transformation of natural vegetation to cultivated fields has resulted in marked increases in water quality degradation and nutrient loading of rivers globally. In many developing countries, monitoring and evaluating the impacts of agriculture on water quality are limited by financial constraints and focus is given to large water bodies. This paper presents and discusses the results of a year-long monitoring of a typical river system in an agricultural setting, namely the Bot River, Western Cape, South Africa. Results show seasonal increases in N concentrations and SRP driven by surrounding agricultural activities. Water chemistry and changes to nutrient loads were found to be site specific, which demonstrates that monitoring programmes focussing on one or two sites are not representative of the entire catchment. Monitoring and reporting of small river systems are thus un(der)-represented in large databases such as the UN Global Environment Monitoring System for Freshwater (GEMS/Water) programme. The results highlight the importance of selecting appropriate and representative monitoring sites for these rivers when budgetary constraints limit the number of points that can be monitored sustainably. The findings should also be applicable to similar catchments in the Western Cape and beyond as they demonstrate the magnitude of seasonal nutrient fluxes in the system.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN	2023	195	1							177	10.1007/s10661-022-10776-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-10776-4								36471015					WOS:000894392400003

Biocrusts buffer against the accumulation of soil metallic nutrients induced by warming and rainfall reduction	COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY												The availability of metallic nutrients in dryland soils, many of which are essential for the metabolism of soil organisms and vascular plants, may be altered due to climate change-driven increases in aridity. Biocrusts, soil surface communities dominated by lichens, bryophytes and cyanobacteria, are ecosystem engineers known to exert critical functions in dryland ecosystems. However, their role in regulating metallic nutrient availability under climate change is uncertain. Here, we evaluated whether well-developed biocrusts modulate metallic nutrient availability in response to 7 years of experimental warming and rainfall reduction in a Mediterranean dryland located in southeastern Spain. We found increases in the availability of K, Mg, Zn and Na under warming and rainfall exclusion. However, the presence of a well-developed biocrust cover buffered these effects, most likely because its constituents can uptake significant quantities of available metallic nutrients. Our findings suggest that biocrusts, a biotic community prevalent in drylands, exert an important role in preserving and protecting metallic nutrients in dryland soils from leaching and erosion. Therefore, we highlight the need to protect them to mitigate undesired effects of soil degradation driven by climate change in this globally expanding biome. Eduardo Moreno-Jimenez et al. experimentally manipulate rainfall and temperature in a Mediterranean dryland to explore the association of biocrusts with essential metallic nutrients. They find that biocrusts-communities of lichens, bryophytes and cyanobacteria on the soil surface-can buffer against the effects of warming and reduced rainfall on metallic nutrient availability.

However, the interactive effects of mulching and N application on soil microbial properties and crop yields have received little attention. A 2-year field experiment was carried out in the Loess Plateau to investigate the independent and combined effects of plastic mulch and N application rate on the soil microbial population, enzymatic activity and grain yield. From 2016 to 2017, two mulching patterns (i.e., plastic mulching and no mulching) were exposed to five different N application rates (0 (N-0), 80 (N-80), 160 (N-160), 200 (N-200) and 240 (N-240) kg N ha(-1)). N application significantly affected the soil microbial community composition, as suggested by significant increases in soil total bacteria, cellulose-decomposing bacteria and the bacterial-to-fungal ratio with N rates. In contrast, the mulching pattern significantly affected soil extracellular enzyme production. Furthermore, there were significant effects of mulching, N application and their interaction on grain yield. The highest grain yield (11,728 kg N ha(-1) in 2016 and 12,350 kg N ha(-1) in 2017) in both growing seasons was consistently obtained under plastic mulching with a N level of 200 kg N ha(-1). Our study showed that plastic mulching significantly affected extracellular enzyme production, and N fertilizer application significantly affected the composition of the soil microbial community. Highlights Independent and coupled effects of mulching and N application on soil biological properties and grain performance were explored. N application significantly influenced soil microbial community composition. Mulching pattern rather than N application independently and significantly affected soil extracellular enzyme production The combined application of plastic mulching with 200 kg N ha(-1) should be seem as an optimum crop production pattern in this area.

Quantification of residue potential was performed at <650, 650-850, 850-1050, and >1050 m elevation by summing the weight of stack, standing residue, and straw. Whereas, assessment in the residues nutrient content was performed at <650, 650-850, 850-1050, and >1050 m elevation and age of residue (fresh and old). The TN, S and P in the residue were determined by Kjeldahl digestion Method, wet acid digestion Method, and two percent acetic acid (CH3COOH) as extracting to extract PO4 respectively. Atomic absorption spectrophotometer was used to determine micronutrient cations such as Fe, Zn, and Cu. B was determined by extraction using a mixture of hydrochloric (HCl) and hydrofluoric (HF) acids to plant tissue digests. The nutrient potential was calculated by multiplying nutrient content in residue with the amount of residue estimated ha(-1). R software (R version 3.5.2) was used to analyze the data. The result indicates that during the last 20 years, the totalcultivated land size covered by sesame was 170,000 (ha) and total grain yield of 0.09 Mt. This implies that the size of cultivated land put under sesame cultivation has increased by 79.5%. On average 2.01 t ha(-1) of residue was produced annually and about 0.34 Mt yr(-1) of residue was harvested from sesame production. The age of residue differed significantly (p < 0.05) on TN, S, P, Zn, Fe, Cu, and B content of sesame residue. Nutrient content in residue was ranged from 34.55-24.53 g TN/kg, 9.6-4.2 g S/kg, 5.2-4.3 g P/kg, 23-14.6 mg Zn/kg, 130.23-94.78 mg Fe/kg, 17-6.2 mg Cu/kg and 10.67-9.12 mg B/kg during fresh and old residue analysis respectively. Elevation differed significantly (p < 0.05) for TN, S, P, Zn, and Fe. Nutrient content in residue was ranged from 27.1-32.2 g TN/kg, 6-8.5 g S/kg, 6.6-4.1 g P/kg, 20.8-17 mg Zn/kg, 109-116 mg Fe/kg, 12.9-10.4 mg Cu/kg and 10.1-9.6 mg B/kg for the elevation range of <650 m and >1050 m respectively. The TN, S, P, Zn, Fe, Cu, and B potentially produced from sesame residue were in the range of 49.4-69.6 kg N ha(-1), 8.5-19.3 kg S ha(-1), 8.7-10.5 kg P ha(-1),294-463 mg Zn ha(-1), 1.99-2.62 g Fe ha(-1), 125-342 mg Cu ha(-1) and 183-214 mg B ha-1 respectively. This study clearly concludes that fresh and old residue as well as elevation are critical factors that need to be considered for exploring crop residue and its nutrient potential, quality, and quantity aspects in dryland farming systems.																				2405-8440				OCT	2020	6	10							e05234	10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05234	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05234								33102857					WOS:000584392300174

In semiarid systems, where the flow regime is less predictable and waterbodies are intermittent, migratory fishes may employ different recruitment strategies. We investigated factors affecting the recruitment dynamics of a migratory fish (Prochilodus hartii) in a semiarid river basin (Jequitinhonha River, Brazil) subjected to river regulation. We sampled eggs, larvae, young-of-the-year (YOY), and subadults over multiple years and at several sites distributed along 300 km of the Jequitinhonha River. Biotic variables were investigated against 13 predictors through different modeling approaches to examine (1) spawning dynamics and its relationship to the flow regime, (2) habitat features related to the presence of YOY, and (3) the relationship between recruitment and floods. Higher densities of eggs and larvae occurred at sites with no influence of river regulation, affected mainly by weekly and daily variations in water level. YOY detection increased by 40% when a lateral stream was present, and occupancy was affected by the length of the lotic stretch. Subadult abundance was not correlated with any predictor related to the flooding regime. Our results show that spawning took place at multiple sites, affected mainly by flow variations, while development and recruitment occurred mostly within river channels and in the confluence of small intermittent tributaries, with little dependence on floods. Therefore, fish recruitment in this semiarid system showed different relationships with floods when compared with river-floodplain systems, highlighting the singularity of drylands.

Using conventional rotary tillage (12 cm) as the control, Yunyan 87 as the test variety, and paddy soil as the test site, we studied the effects of deep tillage (subsoiling 30 cm) on soil nutrients, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) growth. The results showed that deep tillage increased the content of organic carbon, available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK) in the 20-40 cm soil layer. The AMF community was also affected by deep tillage. Glomus, the dominant genus in both groups, increased significantly in soil after deep tillage. The AMF colonization rate was lower than that of conventional rotary tillage. Deep tillage was beneficial for tobacco growth in the middle and late stages. The root growth and nutrient content of the tobacco plants increased. Deep tillage significantly improved the output value of tobacco plants. Deep tillage is conducive to improving soil fertility, promoting the vigorous growth of roots, reducing the dependence of tobacco on AMF, and promoting the high quality and yield of tobacco in the drylands of Hunan.

Methods Sole and combined additions of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens producing 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase and Rhizophagus irregularis into rhizospheric soils were performed under well-watered (WW; 80% field water capacity), moderate water stress (MWS; 50% FWC) and severe water stress (SWS; 35% FWC) in pot-cultured wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Results In moderate and severe drought stress, water use efficiency (WUEB) was increased by 27.9-34.3% in PGPR and 20-22.1% in AMF treatments, respectively, and grain yield was improved by 20.03-30.77% in PGPR and 12.13-34.34% in AMF treatments, respectively, compared with control (CK). Importantly, the co-inoculation of AMF and PGPR significantly promoted WUEB by 11.12-27.77% and grain yield by 18.26-21.68% compared to the average value of two sole inoculations in MWS and SWS treatments, respectively. WUEY and biomass production followed a similar trend as WUEB and yield. Particularly, the above parameters were significantly enhanced with the prolonged developmental stages (p < 0.05). ACC deaminase significantly reduced ACC accumulation in MWS and SWS, enhanced AMF root colonization, and promoted rhizosphere microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen levels across all three developing stages. Furthermore, AMF-PGPR co-inoculation enhanced chlorophyll and carotenoid contents during anthesis while reducing them during pre-harvesting.

The straw checkerboard barrier (SCB) method is effective for sand fixation and has been used to combat aeolian desertification in China. Soil inoculation with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi can help restore degraded lands by improving the soil microbial community and steering plant community development. Combining SCB with afforestation via planting ECM trees and inoculating soil with ECM fungi holds promise for improving plant establishment and growth on shifting sand dunes, but this has yet to be examined. Here, we tested the effects of soil inoculation on ECM colonization of Pinus tabulaeformis roots and the survival and establishment of nursery grown P. tabulaeformis seedlings using three soil treatments: no soil (NS), soil sterilized with fungicide (FPS), and ECM-containing nontreated plantation soil (NPS) collected from a nearby P. tabulaeformis plantation. After two years, P. tabulaeformis survival did not differ among the three soil treatments, but ECM colonization rate, total plant dry weight, and leaf total nitrogen per one seedling in the NPS treatment were 9.0, 2.6, and 3.4 times higher than those in the NS treatment. Water use represented by leaf ?13C was also highest in the NPS treatment. Structural equation modeling showed that soil inoculation enhanced ECM colonization of P. tabulaeformis, thus improving nitrogen uptake and water use, leading to increased plant growth. Suillus, Peziza, Geopora, Tuber, and Tomentella were the dominant genera in NPS treatment; 94% of the ECM roots in the NPS treatment were colonized by ECM fungi not detected in NS treatment, indicating that ECM fungi from the inoculum soil were able to colonize the roots of nursery grown seedlings. Only a few ECM fungal species could colonize P. tabulaeformis roots from the plantation soil inoculated, but the taxonomic diversity including Basidiomycota and functional diversity of mycelial exploration types were increased by soil inoculation. These results suggest that soil inoculation with ECM fungi aids in afforestation with ECM plants for the restoration of degraded drylands, including shifting sand dunes.					taniguchi, takeshi/AAG-5450-2021	taniguchi, takeshi/0000-0001-7386-1117													0925-8574	1872-6992				MAY 1	2021	163								106191	10.1016/j.ecoleng.2021.106191	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2021.106191		MAR 2021											WOS:000634956300003

Temporary grazing exclusion as a passive restoration strategy in a dryland woodland: Effects over time on tree regeneration and on the shrub community	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Passive restoration is acknowledged as a cost-effective approach to restore forest ecosystems. In this approach, restoration implies simply ceasing the disturbance causing degradation. But an efficient allocation of restoration efforts requires an understanding of the recovery trajectories of different ecosystem components. In Mediterranean oak open woodlands (called montado in Portugal), livestock grazing drives important plant community composition changes, and may hamper tree regeneration, threatening the long-term sustainability of this ecosystem. A temporary grazing exclusion may, thus, be an efficient restoration measure. However, how beneficial changes occur with time after exclusion on tree regeneration and on the structure and diversity of the ecosystem, are less clear. In this work, we studied the effects of grazing exclusion as a passive restoration strategy on a cork oak woodland, focusing on cork oak tree (Quercus suber) regeneration and on the structure and diversity of the understory shrub community. We assessed oak seedlings and saplings abundance and height, shrub structure, compositional and functional diversity at sites with 0, 5, 9 and 13 years of grazing exclusion. Cork oak individuals were similarly abundant throughout the chronosequence, but time had a positive effect on the height of saplings, until 9 years of exclusion. Shrub cover increased within 5 years after exclusion, and remained stable thereafter. Shrub taxonomic diversity increased continuously along the chronosequence, while functional diversity did not change consistently. Our results suggest that grazing exclusion may be an effective passive restoration measure, although different components of the ecosystem have different timings of recovery. In the case of the studied cork oak woodlands, tree regeneration may be promoted by a 5-10 years period of exclusion, after which it decreases, while conservation of taxonomic shrub diversity may require at least 13 years of exclusion. Our results highlight the importance of optimizing restoration plans depending on the restoration objective.

It comes from the Mraznica Formation of the Rajec Basin in Fatricum, Zbynov locality, Rajecke Teplice (& Zcaron;ilina district). The presence of a 53 mm long horsetail axis provides good evidence of terrestrial environments during sedimentation of the studied strata. According to our interpretation, such a plant strongly indicates a moist to wet habitat (even swampy environments) on the presumed dryland from where it was transported. This dryland could represent an isolated unknown small island(s) in the vicinity, or the Vindelician-Bohemian Massif that was active as a dryland for the entire period of time from the Triassic through the Late Cretaceous. However, the exact palaeogeographic position of the Fatricum during the Mesozoic in relation to the Vindelician Landmass is not entirely clear, and such an interpretation needs a bit of caution.																			1867-1594	1867-1608				2023 DEC 11	2023										10.1007/s12549-023-00596-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12549-023-00596-w		DEC 2023											WOS:001123181400002

In this study, we examine changes in the water balance and, consequently, the dryland extent across eight ecoregions of the north-central United States by quantifying changes in the growing season (May-September) moisture index (MI) by 2071-99, relative to 1980-2005, under three high-resolution (similar to 4 km) downscaled climate projections (CNRM-CM5, CCSM4, and IPSL-CM5A-MR) of high-emission scenarios (RCP8.5). We find that all ecoregions are projected to become drier as based on significant decreases in MI, except four ecoregions under CNRM-CM5, which projects relatively more moderate warming and much greater increases in precipitation relative to the other two projections. The mean projected MI across the entire study area changes by from +4% to -33%. The proportion of dryland (MI < 0.65) is projected to increase under all projections, but more significantly under the warmer and drier projections represented by CCSM4 and IPSL-CM5A-MR; these two projections also show the largest spatial increases in the arid (33%-53%) and hyperarid (135%-180%) dryland classes and the greatest decrease in the dry subhumid (from -56% to -88%) dryland class. Among the ecoregions, those in the semiarid class have the highest increase in potential evapotranspiration, those in the nondryland and dry subhumid class have the largest decrease in MI, and those in the dry subhumid class have the greatest increase in dryland extent. These changes are expected to have important implications for agriculture, ecological function, biodiversity, vegetation dynamics, and hydrological budget.

An experimental verification	JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY												Growth redundancy, the overgrowth of resource-foraging organs in crop stands, is often detrimental to yield and is thus called a 'tragedy of the commons'. A tragedy can also arise owing to the plastic overproduction of competitive structures when intra-variety individuals forage in close proximity to each other. However, little is known about the sensitivity of crop varieties and resource availability to this 'plastic' tragedy. Pot experiments were designed to investigate this issue. The root competition environment was imposed by growing two plants of the same variety in mesh and plastic partitions. Two wheat varieties (old Monkhead and modern 92-46) were used, and two resource levels were established. Compared with 92-46, Monkhead allocated more biomass to stems and leaves and concurrently less to seeds. We identified intra-variety neighbour effects only in 4 out of 24 allometric comparisons with a small magnitude. Allometric data also revealed a lowered response to fertilizer addition in 92-46 than in Monkhead. Based on a limited sample size, our results revealed a trade-off between above-ground vegetative growth and crop yield. This trade-off resulted in a tragedy of the commons in old Monkhead and enhanced yields in modern 92-46. The tragedy of the commons in wheat may generally arise from genetically fixed traits in terms of growth redundancy in old varieties, rather than from the plastic behaviour of individuals. Modern 92-46 may adopt a conservative strategy of resource use, whereas old Monkhead employs an exploitative strategy. Our findings highlight breeders should select genotypes with low individual competitiveness.

The field experiment was performed from 2009 to 2017 in the eastern part of Loess Plateau, China, to study the effect of tillage (deep ploughing, DP and no-tillage, NT) and seasonal variation in precipitation on soil moisture and root traits and grain yield of wheat. In dry seasons, soil water content, root length surface density (RLSD), and root diameter peaked at 60 cm depth, but in the normal/wet seasons, peaked at 40 cm depth. The reduction of RLSD at anthesis by drought was 44% under NT and 29% with DP, while the reduction in above-ground dry weight was 67% under NT and 56% under DP. More soil water was depleted from the deep soil layer (80-100 cm depth) than that in the shallow layer (20-60 cm depth) from jointing in the dry seasons, and from anthesis in the normal/wet seasons. The higher amount of effective in-seasonal rainfall in the dry seasons increased RLSD at anthesis by 44% with NT and 21% with DP and increased grain yield by 24.1% under NT and 14.2% under DP. The average grain yield in the dry seasons was 28-41% lower than in the normal/wet seasons. The average water use efficiency (WUE) in the dry seasons was 42-54% lower than that in the normal/wet seasons. WUE with DP was 32% higher than that with NT in the dry seasons, while it was 15% higher than that with NT in the normal/wet seasons. The average contribution rates of soil water content at sowing to grain yield under DP and NT were 23-25% in the dry seasons, and 52-53% in the normal/wet seasons. Thus, deep ploughing in summer fallow should be adopted for high water storage and yield stability.

Conservation practices induce tradeoffs in soil function: Observations from the northern Great Plains	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Over the past 30 years, agricultural land use in the northern Great Plains has negatively affected soil health and associated ecosystem services through grassland conversion to cropland and a transition away from small-grain cropping systems to warm-season crops. Mitigating these effects requires adoption of conservation practices, but information about how conservation practices influence on soil condition and function are needed. This study sought to quantify near-surface soil responses to crop diversity and intensity, cover crops, and livestock integration under controlled experimental conditions, and land use (dryland cropping vs. perennial agroecosystems) on working farms and ranches, all on a common Haplustoll soil in southcentral North Dakota, USA. Among dryland cropping practices, diverse, continuous cropping led to improvements in soil structure, nutrient supply potential, and biological habitat, but increased soil acidification and soil NO3-N accumulation. Cover crops had a negligible effect on soil condition and function, while livestock integration on cropland improved nutrient supply potential and biological habitat but impaired water intake into soil. Relative to dryland cropping, soil conditions and functions were consistently improved under perennial agroecosystems. Retention of perennial agroecosystems and adoption of diverse, nutrient-efficient dryland cropping practices should be prioritized to enhance soil health in the northern Great Plains.

However, studies investigating whether and how shrubs affect soil biogeochemical cycles in deep soil layers are relatively limited. In this study, we examined the vertical distribution of the soil nutrient contents and enzymatic activities at the 0-100 cm soil profiles beneath three common xerophytic shrubs (Artemisia ordosica, Caragana korshinskii and Salix psammophila) and in interspace bare soils in a transition zone from desert to loess in the north of China. The soil metrics included the contents of organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, nitrate and ammonium nitrogen, available phosphorus and potassium, and the activities of saccharase, urease, alkaline phosphatase and amylase. We found that the contents of organic carbon, total nitrogen and available potassium, and the activities of saccharase, urease and alkaline phosphatase were higher in the soils beneath shrubs than in the interspace bare areas, but these differences only occurred in the 0-10 cm soil profile but not in the soils below the depth of 10 cm. The soil quality index was consistently improved among the three shrub species in the topsoil. In addition, the soil nutrients were positively correlated with enzymatic activities, and the organic carbon content explained approximately 50% of the variations in the enzymatic activities. Collectively, our results demonstrated that the establishment of xerophytic shrubs improved the soil chemical and biological conditions in the desert-loess transition region, and the effect was restricted to the 0-10 cm soil layer.

In Morocco, the irrigated perimeter of Tadla is the major wheat growing area affected by soil and groundwater salinity problematic. Previous studies have shown that phosphorus (P) fertilization can mitigate the negative effects of salinity on different crops. Thus, field experiments from the combination of four levels of irrigation water salinity and three P-fertilization rates were conducted during two successive growing seasons (between 2019 and 2021) at the National Institute of Agronomic Research (INRA), Tadla, Morocco. Our main objective was evaluating the potential of P-fertilization to improve wheat growth, productivity and quality under saline water irrigation practices. The crop simulation model APSIM, was also tested to assess its performance in simulating wheat growth, productivity, phosphorus and nitrogen nutrient dynamics in soil-plant system under saline conditions. Results showed that appropriate P-fertilization under saline conditions contributed to minimize the effect of salinity and improved wheat growth and production. Also, it was found that increasing P-fertilization improved nutrient uptake, and consequently the plant nutrient content. A good agreement between the measured and APSIM model simulated growth and yield state variables, as well as the plant and soil-N content. However, a model uncertainty and relevant limitations in simulating plant- and soil-P content output were identified and discussed. Overall, our finding suggests that appropriate Papplication minimizes the adverse effects of high soil salinity and can be adopted as a coping strategy in wheat cultivation under saline water irrigation practices.																			2667-064X					DEC	2023	10								100295	10.1016/j.stress.2023.100295	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.stress.2023.100295													WOS:001123306100001

EVALUATION OF SWAT SOIL WATER ESTIMATION ACCURACY USING DATA FROM INDIANA, COLORADO, AND TEXAS	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Soil water content (SWC) is a challenging measurement at the field, watershed, and regional scales. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) soil water estimates were evaluated at three locations: the St. Joseph River watershed (SJRW) in northeast Indiana, the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory (CPRL) at Bushland, Texas, and the USDA-ARS Limited Irrigation Research Farm (LIFR) at Greeley, Colorado. The soil water estimates were evaluated under two scenarios: (1) for the defined soil profile, and (2) by individual layer. Each site's soil water assessment was performed based on the existing management conditions during each experiment, whether dryland or irrigated, and for various periods depending on SWC measurement availability at each site. The SWAT soil water was evaluated as follows: the Indiana site was evaluated under dryland conditions using daily soil water observations for one year; the Texas site was evaluated for a ten-year period under irrigated and dryland conditions using weekly soil water observations from four lysimeters; and the Colorado site was evaluated under irrigated conditions for a four-year period. The simulated soil water was evaluated by comparing the model simulations with observed daily and weekly soil water measurements at the three sites. Based on the results, even though all the SWAT models were considered to perform as good models following calibration (streamflow, ET, etc.), the soil water simulations were unacceptable for the defined soil profile and for individual layers at the three sites. Deeper soil layers had observations greater than field capacity values, indicating poor soil parameterization. The dryland model had greater water content than the irrigated model, contradicting the soil water measurements. This greater soil water simulation with the dryland model is a result of SWAT model uncertainties with ET reduction under dryland conditions due to water stress. This study indicated that soil water estimation using the default SWAT soil water equations has many sources of uncertainties. Two apparent sources resulted in the SWAT model's poor performance: (1) SWAT soil water routines that do not fully represent soil water moving between layers to meet plant demand and (2) uncertainty in soil parameterization.

J	Chang, LL; Niu, GY				Chang, Li-Ling; Niu, Guo-Yue			The Impacts of Interannual Climate Variability on the Declining Trend in Terrestrial Water Storage over the Tigris-Euphrates River Basin	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												The Tigris-Euphrates dryland river basin has experienced a declining trend in terrestrial water storage (TWS) from April 2002 to June 2017. Using satellite observations and a process-based land surface model, we find that cli-mate variations and direct human interventions explain -61% (-0.57 mm month-1) and -39% (-0.36 mm month-1) of the negative trend, respectively. We further disaggregate the effects of climate variations and find that interannual climate variability contributes substantially (-0.27 mm month-1) to the negative TWS trend, slightly greater than the decadal cli-mate change (-0.25 mm month-1). Interannual climate variability affects TWS mainly through the nonlinear relationship between monthly TWS dynamics and aridity. Slow recovery of TWS during short wetting periods does not compensate for rapid depletion of TWS through transpiration during prolonged drying periods. Despite enhanced water stress, the dryland ecosystems show slightly enhanced resilience to water stress through greater partitioning of evapotranspiration into tran-spiration and weak surface "greening" effects. However, the dryland ecosystems are vulnerable to drought impacts. The basin shows straining ecosystem functioning after experiencing a severe drought event. In addition, after the onset of the drought, the dryland ecosystem becomes more sensitive to variations in climate conditions.																			1525-755X	1525-7541				MAR	2023	24	3					549	560		10.1175/JHM-D-22-0026.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-22-0026.1													WOS:000972648900001

Short; Dong, Jianzhi; Trigo, Isabel F.; Salvucci, Guido D.; Entekhabi, Dara			Tropical surface temperature response to vegetation cover changes and the role of drylands	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Vegetation cover creates competing effects on land surface temperature: it typically cools through enhancing energy dissipation and warms via decreasing surface albedo. Global vegetation has been previously found to overall net cool land surfaces with cooling contributions from temperate and tropical vegetation and warming contributions from boreal vegetation. Recent studies suggest that dryland vegetation across the tropics strongly contributes to this global net cooling feedback. However, observation-based vegetation-temperature interaction studies have been limited in the tropics, especially in their widespread drylands. Theoretical considerations also call into question the ability of dryland vegetation to strongly cool the surface under low water availability. Here, we use satellite observations to investigate how tropical vegetation cover influences the surface energy balance. We find that while increased vegetation cover would impart net cooling feedbacks across the tropics, net vegetal cooling effects are subdued in drylands. Using observations, we determine that dryland plants have less ability to cool the surface due to their cooling pathways being reduced by aridity, overall less efficient dissipation of turbulent energy, and their tendency to strongly increase solar radiation absorption. As a result, while proportional greening across the tropics would create an overall biophysical cooling feedback, dryland tropical vegetation reduces the overall tropical surface cooling magnitude by at least 14%, instead of enhancing cooling as suggested by previous global studies.

Integrated nutrient management improves soil organic matter and agronomic sustainability of semiarid rainfed Inceptisols of the Indo-Gangetic Plains	JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE												Background Climate and management practices impact the soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks of agricultural soils. Especially under the semiarid climate of India, organic matter is rapidly decomposed, and imbalanced nutrient input further exacerbates its depletion, thus facilitating the decline in soil quality and crop yields. Improving SOC contents through integrated nutrient management (INM), that is, conjunctive use of organic and chemical sources of nutrients, could ameliorate soil health and sustain crop yields. Aim To assess the potential of the INM approach to enhance the SOC status, soil quality, crop production, and drought adaptation of pearl millet under rainfed conditions. Methods Nutrient inputs were supplied through mineral fertilizers, organic manures, and a combination of both. SOC sequestration, sustainable yield index, plant-available N, P, K, and water, bulk density, and KMnO4-oxidizable C were estimated. Results Higher SOC sequestration rate (0.50 and 0.48 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) in 50% N (fertilizer) + 50% N (farmyard manure), and 50% N (fertilizer) + 50% N (crop residue), respectively) and significant increase in soil fertility were recorded in organically amended treatments. Improvement of 1 Mg ha(-1) of SOC stock in the root zone (0.4 m depth) reduced the severity of drought and increased the yield by 38 kg ha(-1). Plots under organic amendments suffered less yield losses under short-duration droughts, but this positive effect could only be exploited when the rainfall deficit was up to 25%. Conclusion Managements that add up to 1.2 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) SOC are adaptive and climate-resilient strategies in dry semiarid degraded Inceptisols of the Indo-Gangetic Plains.

Waters of the Sao Francisco River have been launched in the Paraiba basin since 2017. The objective of transposition is to perpetuate Paraiba River and ensuring water security for the reservoirs. Several morphometric index were applied to better understand the fluvial morphodynamics in the relief genesis of the Upper Paraiba River basin. Digital Elevation Model was obtained from SRTM, with spatial resolution of 30 m and the drainage network was obtained in the scale 1:100,000. The morphometric parameters used were: hierarchical order of the channel (U), number of channels (Nu), length of channels (Lu), length of the basin (Lb), bifurcation ratio (Rb), area (A), perimeter (P), drainage density (Dd), river density (Dr), drainage texture (T), elongation ratio (Re), circularity index (Ic), form factor (Ff), maximum altitude (Hmax), minimum altitude (Hmin), basin amplitude (Bh), roughness index (Ir) and concentration time (Tc). The results showed that the Upper Paraiba River basin is classified as 7th hierarchical order; the sub-basins of the Sucuru and Umbuzeiro Rivers are 6(a) order, whereas the one of Monteiro River is classified as 5(a) order. Drainage density and river density are low. All the basins are elongated, being the Monteiro River sub-basin the most elongated of all. The altimetric amplitude is high (> 800 m) and it yields high energetic potential for water flows. Drainage network is extensive and complex, 7th hierarchical order and with strong structural control. The highest relief levels are associated with granitoids in the municipality of Sao Joao do Tigre. As much for the river hierarchy as for the amplitude of the relief, the Umbuzeiro River is, from the point of view of morphometry, the most important of the basin.					da Silva, Richarde Marques/C-2264-2015; ALBUQUERQUE XAVIER, RAFAEL/IUQ-8254-2023; da Silva, Richarde Marques/AAB-2690-2021	da Silva, Richarde Marques/0000-0001-6601-5174; ALBUQUERQUE XAVIER, RAFAEL/0000-0002-1737-7547; da Silva, Richarde Marques/0000-0001-6601-5174													1519-1540	2236-5664				JUL-SEP	2020	21	3					601	614		10.20502/rbg.v21i3.1757	http://dx.doi.org/10.20502/rbg.v21i3.1757													WOS:000569554400009

A 2-year field study was conducted to better understand the contributions of different internodes to grain yield. We measured remobilization of stored carbon reserves in eight wheat genotypes under irrigated and dryland conditions. For each genotype, plant samples consisting of ten culms were collected between anthesis and physiological maturity. There was no difference in single stem weight loss between two water levels, but the stem loss contribution to yield was higher in dryland wheat (54.4%) than that in irrigated wheat (38.5%). Among the genotypes, the stem loss contribution to yield ranged 38.9%-58.1% in the relatively wet season of 2017 and 36.5%-62.5% in the dry season of 2018. The amount of stem loss showed a strong relationship with grain yield, especially under the dryland condition. At each sampling date, length as well as the dry weight of peduncle (first internode from the top) was greater than the other internodes; however, more stem loss (in weight and percentage weight) occurred in the third internode, followed by second and fourth internodes. Results suggest that the stem loss contribution to yield is greater under dryland than irrigated condition and occurs mainly in the middle portion of the culm.

A new approach for measuring surface hydrological connectivity	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The development of surface hydrological connectivity is a key determinant of flood magnitude in drylands. Thresholds in runoff response may be reached when isolated runoff-generating areas connect with each other to form continuous links to river channels, enabling these areas to contribute to flood hydrographs. Such threshold behaviour explains observed nonlinearities and scale dependencies of dryland rainfall-runoff relationships and complicates attempts at flood prediction. However, field methods for measuring the propensity of a surface to transmit water downslope are lacking, and conventional techniques of infiltration measurement are often inappropriate for use on non-agricultural drylands. Here, we argue for a reconceptualization of the dryland surface runoff process, suggesting that the downslope transfer of water should be considered alongside surface infiltration; that is, there is a need for the "aggregated" measurement of infiltration and overland flow hydraulics. Surface application of a set volume of water at a standardized rate generates runoff that travels downslope; the distance it travels downslope is determined by infiltration along the flow, integration of flow paths, and flow resistance. We demonstrate the potential of such a combined measurement system coupled with structure-from-motion photogrammetry to identify surface controls on runoff generation and transfer on dryland hillslopes, with vegetation, slope, surface stone cover, and surface roughness all having a significant effect. The measurement system has been used on slopes up to 37 degrees compared with the flat surface typically required for infiltration methods. On average, the field workflow takes similar to 10-15 min, considerably quicker than rainfall simulation. A wider variety of surfaces can be sampled with relative ease, as the method is not restricted to stone and vegetation-free land. We argue that this aggregated measurement represents surface connectivity and dryland runoff response better than standard hydrological approaches and can be applied on a much greater variety of dryland surfaces.

Subsoils, commonly fragipans and argillic horizons, may restrict root growth and limit crop access to critical stored soil water, but this phenomenon is not well characterized in the Palouse. During the 2017-2018 growing season, an on-farm study of soil profiles in two commercial winter wheat fields in eastern Washington and northern Idaho was established to observe the effects of soil bulk density on winter wheat root system depth and subsoil water depletion. At harvest, grain yield, root density, soil bulk density, and postharvest soil water and nitrogen content were measured to 120 cm at 15-cm segments in the profile. Root-restrictive depth (RRD) was defined as the depth where root density was less than or equal to 0.25 intersections cm(-2) cross-sectional area. Soil bulk density negatively affected root density and consequently increased the probability of shallow RRD. Shallow RRD was common, with 38% of profiles having RRD less than or equal to 105 cm. Postharvest soil-water content at the bottom of the measured profile (105-120 cm) was 41% higher in profiles with RRD of 90 cm than nonrestricted profiles. Yield declined with increase in postharvest soil water content at 105-120 cm depth. Findings indicate that dense subsoils can reduce stored soil water depletion by limiting root density and root system depth that, in turn, limits yield.

We conducted two experiments to investigate the effects of replacing oat hay by leguminous forages (alfalfa hay [AH], 0, 8, 16, and 24%, experiment 1; common vetch hay [CVH], 0, 10, 20, and 30%, experiment 2) on energy metabolism of crossbred Simmental cattle. In experiment 1, total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations increased quadratically with increasing AH proportions (p = .006) with a forage-to-concentrate ratio of approximately 50:50, whereas the CH4 energy to gross energy intake ratio (CH4- E:GEI) was significantly lower with 16% AH compared with 24% AH diet (p < .05). In experiment 2, there were no differences in the total VFA concentrations among the four diet groups with a forage-to-concentrate ratio of around 60:40 (p > .05); however, CH4-E:GEI was significantly lower in the 30% CVH diet compared with the 10% CVH diet (p < .05). There was no significant difference in feed conversion efficiency among the four diet groups in each experiment. The results suggest that substituting 16 and 30% oat hay by AH and CVH provide optimal diets with forage-to-concentrate ratios of 50:50 and 60:40, respectively, which may reduce CH4 emission without compromising the feed conversion efficiency of crossbred Simmental cattle.

The diets consisted of five replacement levels [0, 200, 400, 600, and 800 g/kg on a dry matter (DM) basis] and were formulated to be isonitrogenous [140 g/kg crude protein [CP], considering the ingredients' composition, with a roughage/concentrate ratio of 65:35, on a DM basis. Five uncastrated crossbred sheep, with an average body weight of 52.9 +/- 6.0 kg, were assigned to a 5 x 5 Latin square. The trial lasted for 105 days with five consecutive 21-day periods, divided into 14-day adaptation and 7-day sampling periods. Dry matter (DM), organic matter, non-fiber carbohydrate (NFC), total digestible nutrient intake, and DM and NFC digestibility, increased (P <= 0.04) with the replacement of sorghum silage by CC. However, the time spent feeding and ruminating decreased, while idle time increased (P <= 0.03). Only feeding and rumination efficiency of DM improved (P <= 0.01) with the replacement, whereas feeding and rumination efficiency of neutral detergent fiber corrected to ash and protein did not. Nitrogen intake and nitrogen balance were not influenced, and urinary volume increased (P <= 0.01) with the addition of CC in the diet. In conclusion, we recommend replacing 80% of the sorghum silage with CC in sheep diets (with 35% concentrate), as CC was found to substantially increase the intake of nutrients, primarily energy.

This study grew 32 cultivars released from 1965 to 2017 for two cropping seasons (a dry year, 2016-2017, and a humid year, 2017-2018) to examine yield potential achieved through efficiencies in canopy light interception, solar energy conversion, harvest index (HI), and nitrogen (N) uptake and utilization. Yield gain for wheat (25.0 +/- 1.8 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) resulted from increases in plant biomass, HI, and N utilization efficiency (NUtE). Modern cultivars with an erect canopy and slender flag-leaves optimized light interception and could achieve higher biomass yield. The introduction of semi-dwarf genes (Rht-8) reduced plant height (0.05 yr(-1)) and improved HI (0.004 yr(-1)) and NUtE resulting from both increased pre-anthesis accumulated biomass and plant dry matter mobilization after anthesis. Greater biomass partitioning to spikes resulted in higher fruiting efficiency and grain number. Due to greater tillering capability through increased N uptake efficiency, increased fertile spikes and grain yield were observed. Among these newer cultivars, the rate of yield gain was slow, and yield stability was more affected by accumulative rainfall than diurnal temperature. The future challenge of wheat breeding is to maintain the genetic yield gain without increasing the reliance on chemical fertilizers under an increasingly variable climate.

Summer irrigation of pasture enhances the transfer and short-term storage of soil organic carbon in the particulate and mineral-associated organic matter fractions	SOIL RESEARCH												Soil organic carbon (SOC) is both a source and sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), with important implications for global climate change. Irrigation of grazed pastures has reportedly increased, reduced or made no difference to SOC stocks relative to dryland management. This study examined, over an annual plant growth cycle, the persistence of photosynthate-derived carbon (C) previously allocated to the plant-soil system during summer, under irrigated or dryland conditions. A continuous(13)CO(2)pulse labelling method was used to label ryegrass (Lolium perenneL.) and white clover (Trifolium repensL.) mesocosms under simulated dryland or irrigated conditions. Plant and soil(13)C was traced over 349 days using destructive sampling on days 1, 12, 125, 237 and 349 (T1-T5 respectively). After the cessation of labelling and summer irrigation, the mesocosms were maintained under the same seasonal soil moisture conditions. The persistence of(13)C in the aboveground plant C pools was lower than in the root C pool. Approximately 50% of the initial mass of(13)C recovered in roots at T1 remained by T5. There was no difference between the summer irrigated and dryland treatments in terms of the(13)C recovered from the soil over the subsequent annual growing season. There was also no significant change in the(13)C recovered in the soil between T1 and T5. However, summer irrigation did affect the spatial and temporal distribution of the photosynthate-derived C within the soil size fractions relative to summer dryland conditions. Summer irrigation promoted the transfer and storage of(13)C in the fine particulate organic matter and clay size fractions.

However, the effect of land use on terrestrial ecological processes and soil microbial community assembly in riparian zone was still imprecise. This study focused on the relationship of soil properties and microbial communities in paddy and dryland soils of a typical riparian zone in the TGR. The results indicated a higher level of accumulation of total organic carbon (TOC) in paddy soil (14.88-20.29 g kg(-1)) than that in dryland soil (7.59-16.20 g kg(-1)). The riparian soil was slightly polluted by cadmium and phthalate acid esters with an average concentration of 0.19 mg kg(-1) and 6.45 mg kg(-1), which may be from agricultural sources, posing a potential health risk. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing analysis, there was a higher microbial diversity in paddy soils than dryland soils, and Acidobacteriaceae and Anaerolineaceae represented the dominant taxa in dryland and paddy soils, respectively. Furthermore, the results of redundancy analysis and structural equation modeling showed that land use driven change in soil organic carbon affected the fate of soil pollutants, and constructed soil microbial communities in the riparian zone of TGR. Null model revealed that homogeneous selection explained about 76.36% and 53.33% microbial community assembly, followed by dispersal limitation (14.54% and 37.50%) in dryland and paddy soil. In consequence, a strong effect of environmental filtering was observed on arable soil microbial community structure with different land use in the riparian zone of TGR, and TOC was the key regulator.

These fallow tillage methods have been widely applied in the Loess Plateau region of China to improve soil water availability and preventing soil erosion. To investigate the effect of different tillage practices for increasing the production of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and their relationship with precipitation distribution in the semiarid southeast region of the Loess Plateau, a six-year field study was conducted from 2009 to 2015, using three tillage treatments: deep ploughing (DP), subsoiling (SS), and no-tillage (NT). Our results indicated that DP and SS treatments increased soil water storage in the 0-300 cm soil layer at sowing and soil organic carbon in the 0-20 cm soil layer at maturity. In addition, DP and SS increased soil water consumption in the 0-180 cm soil layer from sowing to anthesis, and in the 120-300 cm layer from anthesis to maturity of wheat. Furthermore, the DP and SS treatments significantly increased the root length, root surface area, and the number of root tips in the 0-80 cm and aboveground dry biomass at maturity. Additionally, DP and SS treatments increased the grain yield by 31% and 26%, precipitation use efficiency by 32% and 26%, and water use efficiency by 12% and 11% respectively, as compared with those of the NT treatments. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that soil water consumption was significantly positively correlated with precipitation from sowing to jointing and anthesis to maturity. In addition, grain yield had a significant positive correlation with precipitation during the fallow season, particularly in the SS treatment. Moreover, grain yield was significantly positively correlated with soil water consumption in the 0-180 cm soil layer from sowing to jointing, and at 60-240 cm soil depth from jointing to maturity. In conclusion, under low precipitation, DP was more favorable for winter wheat than SS, whereas, under high precipitation, SS was more beneficial than DP.

Effects of dryland summer cover crops and a weedy fallow on soil water, disease levels, wheat growth and grain yield in a Mediterranean-type environment	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Numerous studies have reported wide-ranging benefits of cultivating cover crops during the typical fallow period in temperate cropping systems. However, data on the impacts of summer cover crops in water-limited, Mediterranean-type climates, is lacking. A 3-year field experiment was conducted near the town of Northam in the wheat-belt of Western Australia to test the hypothesis that inclusion of summer cover crops would increase ground cover, water storage and grain yield in subsequent wheat crops. White French millet (Panicum miliaceum) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) cover crops and a weedy fallow were compared to a typical chemical fallow over the summer period. Autumn groundcover was 10-30% higher when summer weeds were left uncontrolled compared to the chemical fallow treatment. Dry-sown and late established (February) millet failed to increase groundcover, whereas cowpea demonstrated a small increase (similar to 9-10%) in one season, when cowpea biomass approached 1 t ha(-1). Cover crops and weeds growing over summer had no significant effect on total plant available water (0-50 cm depth) prior to sowing wheat in any season. However, there was less readily available soil N in the cover crop (less 10-30 kg N ha(-1)) and weedy fallow (less 50 kg N ha(-1)) treatments prior to the second wheat crop. Despite some significant effects of weedy fallow and cowpeas on Gaeumannomyces graminis var tritici (take-all) and Didymella pinodes (causing black pea spot), disease levels were low and thought to pose little risk to following winter crops. Wheat grain yields were not significantly different between treatments, other than a low yield after cowpeas in 2015 due to a low wheat emergence count. Grain protein and screenings were not generally affected by summer fallow treatment in any year, except for higher screenings after the weedy fallow in one year. Given the limited impacts of cover crops and weeds on soil water and disease, it is possible that summer cover crops may be able to be integrated with cereal winter rotations in Western Australia without yield reductions in wheat crops. In light of current chemical usage, issues around herbicide residues in soil and herbicide-resistant weeds, it would be worthwhile revisiting the need for chemical fallow, particularly in the higher rainfall areas.

This effect may be further complicated by the frequent occurrence of drought, as predicted in most of the climate change scenarios. Lentil ( Lens culinaris Medik.) and faba bean ( Vicia faba L.) were grown in the Australian Grains Free Air CO2 Enrichment facility under either ambient CO2 concentration ([CO2], similar to 400 mmol mol(-1)) or elevated [CO2] ( e[CO2], similar to 550 mmol mol(-1)), and with two contrasting watering regimes ( for faba bean) or over two consecutive seasons contrasting in rainfall ( for lentil), to investigate the interactive effect of e[CO2] and drought on concentrations of selected grain minerals ( Fe, Zn, Ca, Mg, P, K, S, Cu, Mn, Na). Grain mineral concentration ( Fe, Zn, Ca, K, S, Cu) increased and grain mineral yield ( i. e. g mineral per plot surface area) decreased in dry growing environments, and vice versa in wet growing environments. Elevated [CO2] decreased Fe, Zn, P and S concentrations in both crops; however, the relative decrease was greater under dry ( 20-25%) than wet ( 4-10%) growing conditions. Principal component analysis showed that greater grain yield stimulation under e[CO2] was associated with a reduction in Fe and Zn concentrations, indicating a yield dilution effect, but this was not consistently observed for other minerals. Even if energy intake is kept constant to adjust for lower yields, decreased legume micronutrients densities under e[CO2] may have negative consequences for human nutrition, especially under drier conditions and in areas with less access to food.

However, extreme climate phenomena like the El Nino events (EN) may change soil respiration (Rs) - the CO2 emitted from soils resulting from biological activity and the largest outgoing flux of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems. Our aim was to study the effect of the EN on Rs in the North Peruvian dryland forest, and its interaction with soil temperature and the tree canopy. Our results indicate that Rs during the EN years increased by a factor of 100 compared to normal years, but this effect was exacerbated by the proximity to trees. Only under trees and during the EN event temperature exerted a positive control over daily Rs fluctuations. Our results, indicate how in these dryland forests the expected increase in the EN frequency and intensity could affect soil CO2 emissions, and hence ecosystem carbon budgets, but that this effect would very much depend on tree density and tree spatial distribution.

Different types of biocrusts, spanning a spectrum from cyanobacteria-dominated and moss-dominated, have distinct roles in rainfall redistribution patterns, but the ecohydrological effects of different biocrust types on dryland ecosystem dynamics remain largely unclear. This study developed an ecohydrological model with biocrust as a system state variable to explicitly explore the effects of different biocrust types on dryland vegetation dynamics in Shapotou region in northern China, particularly after restoration. The results indicated that both cyanobacteria-andmoss-dominated biocrusts could support high grass cover (approximately 40%) after restoration. Cyanobacterial, but not moss biocrusts, could also maintain a high level of shrub cover (13 and 3%, respectively). Shifting from cyanobacteria to mosses gradually increased the biocrust cover from approximately 40% to 80%. The biocrust's water-holding capacity (the volume of water it can intercept per unit area) is likely be able to explain the dynamics of biocrust and shrub cover (with correlation efficiency of R-2 = 0.972 and 0.987, respectively), but not grass cover (R-2 = 0.224). The findings suggest that biocrust type may significantly affect coverage of biocrusts and shrubs, but not grass coverage, and global climate change may influence dryland restoration by altering biocrust types.

The current knowledge about interspecific water relationship is in one dimension, i.e., the vertical direction, little is known in both vertical and horizontal directions under different rainfall conditions. Therefore, an experiment was carried out in an apple tree based intercropping system and an apple tree monoculture on China's Loess Plateau during one growing season which started with a high rainfall period followed by a low rainfall period. We investigated the spatial distribution of soil water and plant root, and simulated their water use strategies using the 3D Hi-sAFe model. The root growth of apple trees in the top 60 cm was restricted by intercropping in the cropped area but increased in the top 40 cm in the uncropped area compared with monoculture. In the high rainfall period, compared with the control, the apple trees' water absorption from the uncropped area (0-60 cm) increased by 44.43%, but the water utilization from the cropped area (0-60 cm) decreased by 32.59%. More than 90% of the soil water absorbed by B. napus came from the 0-60 cm soil layer in the cropped area. During the low rainfall period, intercropping promoted an increase of 14.79% in apple trees' water absorption from the 60-100 cm soil layer in the cropped area. The soil water in the 20-60 cm layer became the main source for B. napus and its contribution was 63.51%, but only 20.56% of the water absorbed by apple trees came from here. It can be concluded that, to alleviate water competition, water absorption between species was segregated horizontally during the wet period due to the roots "niche differentiation", while water use complementarity occurred along the vertical axis during the dry period.

Subsequent to Rep-PCR fingerprinting, 16S rDNA gene sequencing of 15 representative strains showed that all of them belong to the genus Ensifer. Phylogenetic analysis and concatenation of the housekeeping genes gyrB, rpoB, recA, and dnaK revealed that the entire collection (except strain LMR678) shared 99.08 % to 99.92% similarity with Ensifer sp. USDA 257 and 96.92% to 98.79% with Sinorhizobium BJ1. Phylogenetic anal-ysis of nodC and nodA sequences showed that all strains but one (LMR678) formed a phylogenetic group with the type strain "E. aridi" LMR001T (similarity over 98%). Moreover, it was relevant that most strains belong to the symbiovar vachelliae. In vitro tests revealed that five strains produced IAA, four solubilized inorganic phos-phate, and one produced siderophores. All strains showed tolerance to NaCl concentrations ranging from 2 to 12% and grew at up to 10% of PEG6000. A greenhouse plant inoculation test conducted during five months demonstrated that most rhizobial strains were infective and efficient. Strains LMR688, LMR692, and LMR687 exhibited high relative symbiotic efficiency values (respectively 231.6 %, 171.96 %, and 140.84 %). These strains could be considered as the most suitable candidates for inoculation of V. t. subsp. raddiana, to be used as a pioneer plant for restoring arid soils threatened with desertification.

In this study, we compared the performance of FAO-LCCS version 1.1 and version 1.2 (FAO-LCCS V. 1.1 and V. 1.2) images for monitoring and predicting LULC changes, mainly date palm plantation (DPP) pattern in Ziban region (Northeast Algeria). Three consecutive pairs of FAO-LCCS V. 1.1 and V. 1.2 images were used for monitoring LULC changes during the years 2009, 2012, and 2015. Decision tree algorithm classification was used to reclassify FAO-LCCS V. 1.1 and 1.2 images to five standard classes during the years 2009, 2012, and 2015. CA-Markov model was applied to simulate future DPP dynamics for the years 2018, 2021, 2024, 2027, and 2030. In case of FAO-LULC V. 1.2, there was no change in the five classes between all the studied years. In case of FAO-LULC V. 1.1, results revealed that from 2009 to 2012, 2012 to 2015, DPP cover increased with 0.44%, and similar to 1%, respectively, and it is expected to increase to 4.5% by 2030. For accuracy assessment, reclassification results and CA-Markov model were validated using kappa index statistics. More than 61% of overall accuracy was computed for each of the six FAO-LULC maps. CA-Markov model reached 88% of overall accuracy. The findings of this study showed reasonably good performance of the CA-Markov model. Besides. FOA-LCCS V. 1.1 data can be considered as an appropriate and useful data in studying LULC changes and vegetation growth at regional scale. These results represent a useful tool for limiting change land uses in the study area.																			2363-6203	2363-6211				SEP	2022	8	3					3215	3230		10.1007/s40808-021-01289-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40808-021-01289-z		SEP 2021											WOS:000701350300001

Comparison of surface foil materials and dew collectors location in an arid area: a one-year field experiment in Kenya	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												This study characterized different polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic foil materials effectiveness for dew collection in arid field-conditions in Kenya. Dew yields were collected daily for one year. Ten dew collectors with four different plastic foils were setup in the experimental field. The cumulated dew yields ranged from 18.9 to 25.3 mm. The greatest cumulated dew yields were 25.3 mm (nightly mean 0.096 mm) and 24.3 mm (nightly mean 0.093) measured with PVC and OPUR coated collectors respectively. The lowest cumulated dew yields 18.9 mm (nightly mean 0.075 mm) and 19.1 mm (nightly mean 0.074 mm) were measured with PVC and PE coated collectors respectively. Dew provided a continuous water source during the dry season. The type of the surface material was not found to be a determining factor for the collected dew yield. The location of the collector at the experimental field had impact on the collected dew yields. We also compared harvested dew yields to measured meteorological parameters and calculated dew yields with the use of a diffusion model using the measured surface temperatures and coefficient of mass diffusion to evaluate the dew collecting potential under the prevailing conditions.

In this sense, sediment analysis gains importance for environmental planning, as it is the final destination of polluting heavy metals and soluble salts contained in groundwater or surface water. This research consisted of the geochemical and mineralogical analysis of the alluvial deposits of the Riacho do Tigre Basin - PB, such as the variety and occurrence of specific chemical and mineral elements identified in the samples, using the techniques of X-Ray Fluorescence (FRX) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). Samples were collected from five points of analysis, selected by the proximity of the alluvial section with shallow wells used by the local community, considering the possibility of contamination of the aquifer by sediment in different units. The results indicated that the widest variety of minerals on sections 1, and 3, the only point with traces of heavy metal, chromium. On sections 2 and 4 showed a predominance of silicon oxide minerals, such as quartz, tridymite (in section 2) and cristobalite (in section 4). In section 5, silica corresponds only to quartz, and it was also possible to identify another mineral, which is magnetite, despite having a diffraction peak with low intensity. The identified minerals coincide with the lithological characteristics of the Riacho do Tigre basin.

To this end, the performance of a genetically modified (GM) stacked-trait herbicide and insect resistant Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) maize hybrid was compared to a GM herbicide tolerant hybrid, a non-GM hybrid and an open pollinated variety (OPV). The trials were conducted in three localities under natural stem borer infestation in irrigated and non irrigated (dryland) fields. No stem borer infestation was observed on Bt maize plants from the seedling to the flowering stages in all fields at all trial sites. Stem borer infestation was higher under irrigation compared to dryland conditions. The stem borer complex on non-Bt maize plants under irrigation was dominated by Chilo partellus whilst only Busseola fusca larvae were recorded under dryland conditions. The yield of the Bt maize variety under irrigation was significantly higher than that of the OPV but not different (P>0.05) from that of the non-Bt hybrids. No significant (P>0.05) difference in yield was observed between Bt and non-Bt maize varieties under dryland conditions. The results highlight the need to base dissemination and adoption decisions of relatively expensive agricultural technologies such as GM maize on the results of context specific field trials.

Interactions among cereal cyst nematode <i>Heterodera filipjevi</i>, dryland crown rot <i>Fusarium culmorum</i>, and drought on grain yield components and disease severity in bread wheat	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY												The cereal cyst nematode (CCN) Heterodera and crown rot caused by Fusarium species limit cereal production and yield potential. Losses increase when CCN and crown rot occur together, especially under water stress conditions. The objective of this study was to investigate the interactions among Heterodera filipjevi, Fusarium culmorum, and drought on a set of wheat germplasm with differing levels of resistance/tolerance to CCN, crown rot and drought. Plant emergence was significantly reduced (56% seedling death) when seeds were planted in a water stress environment where F. culmorum and H. filipjevi were present. Crown rot was more severe under water stress compared with Fusarium inoculation alone. The number of cysts fell significantly when H. filipjevi was co-inoculated with F. culmorum, revealing an antagonistic interaction between the nematode and fungus. The highest number of cysts was found on the susceptible accession 'Seri' under water stress conditions. Water stress caused a significant reduction in plant height, while F. culmorum inoculation did not, unless combined with water stress. Yield components were significantly reduced by each of the single stresses and losses were greater when plants were exposed to double or triple stresses. Water stress and F. culmorum inoculation caused a significant reduction in spike weight and seeds per spike. The chlorophyll content of wheat leaves was negatively affected by water stress and inoculation by both nematode and fungus. In conclusion, water stress exacerbates the damage caused by CCN and crown rot, and planting drought-resistant varieties would be an ideal solution to reduce losses.

Dryland pea (Pisum sativum L.) is an important pulse crop that can replace fallow or be added to existing crop rotations to sustain crop yields in arid and semiarid regions. Yet, we lack management practices to enhance yield and quality of dryland pea. This study evaluated the effect of crop rotation and cultural practices on dryland pea growth, yield, and quality from 2006 to 2011 in the northern Great Plains, USA. Stacked rotations were durum (Triticum turgidum L.)-durum-canola (Brassica napus L.)-pea (DDCP) and durum-durum-flax (Linum usitatissimum L.)-pea (DDFP), and alternate-year rotations were durum-canola-durum-pea (DCDP) and durum-flax-durum-pea (DFDP). Traditional cultural practice included a combination of conventional till, recommended seed rate, broadcast N fertilization, and reduced stubble height, and improved cultural practice a combination of no-till, increased seed rate, banded N fertilization, and increased stubble height. Pea pod number, plant height, grain yield, and N uptake were 4 to 18% greater with DCDP and DDCP than other rotations. Improved cultural practice increased stand count by 29% over traditional cultural practice. Biomass yield, N uptake, and grain protein concentration varied with crop rotations and cultural practices in various years. Seed number, seed weight, harvest index, and N harvest index were not influenced by treatments. Pea yield and N uptake increased with alternate-year rotation due to increased pod number and plant height. Stand count increased with improved cultural practice. Alternate-year crop rotations and improved cultural practice enhanced dryland pea yield and quality.																				2639-6696					2019	2	1								10.2134/age2018.10.0041	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/age2018.10.0041													WOS:001009059700059

Several studies have examined this at plot and watershed scales, but no systematic study of soil erosion severity and management solutions at national scale is available. This study investigated soil erosion and the potential of land-cover- and agroecology-specific land management practices in reducing soil loss through employing the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation and the best available datasets. The mean rate of soil loss by water erosion in Ethiopia was estimated as 16.5 t ha(-1) yr(-1), with an annual gross soil loss of ca. 1.9 x 10(9) t, of which the net soil loss was estimated as ca. 410 x 10(6) t (22% of the gross soil loss). Soil loss varied across land cover types, 15 agroecological zones, and 10 river basins, with the main contributors in the respective analyses being cropland (ca. 23% of Ethiopia; 50% of the soil loss; mean soil loss rate of 36.5 t ha(-1) yr(-1)), Moist Weyna Dega (ca. 10%; 20%; 33.3 t ha(-1) yr(-1)), and the Abay basin (ca. 15%; 30%; 32.8 t ha(-1) yr(-1)). Our results show that ca. 25% of Ethiopia (28 x 10(6) ha) has soil loss rates above 10 t ha(-1) yr(-1), which is higher than the tolerable soil loss limits estimated for Ethiopia. Ex-ante analysis revealed that implementation of land-cover- and agroecology-specific land management practices (level bunds, graded bunds, trenches, and exclosures combined with trenches and/or bunds) in such areas could reduce the mean soil loss rate from 16.5 t ha(-1) yr(-1) to 5.3 t ha(-1) yr(-1) (mean, by ca. 68%; range, 65-70%). Suitable land management practices in the Abay and Tekeze basins and Dega and Weyna Dega agroecologies, which experience particularly severe erosion, would account for ca. 50 and 70% of the estimated soil loss reduction, respectively. This study can help raise awareness among policy makers and land managers of the extent and severity of soil loss by water erosion for better conservation planning in river basins to support sustainable use of land and water resources.

Humid phases on the southwestern Arabian Peninsula are consistent with the last two interglacials	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Past environmental and climatic conditions within the Arabian Peninsula are key to understanding the setting for hominin dispersal across the Saharo-Arabian dryland belt. The tufa deposits within the volcanic harrats on the southwest coast of Saudi Arabia fill a significant spatial gap in the distribution of palaeoenvironmental records on the west coast of the Arabian Peninsula adjacent to the Red Sea. In the catchment of Wadi Dabsa in the Harrat Al Birk, there are widespread fossil palustrine to shallow-lacustrine tufa deposits with fluvial elements. Several phases of tufa accumulation, separated by fluvial downcutting, are observable within these powerful palaeoenvironmental proxies. U-Th dating of targeted dense, banded tufa facies, yield ages that are stratigraphically consistent at the landscape scale, and indicate that tufa accumulation occurred during distinct humid phases broadly coeval with the last two warm interglacial Marine Isotope Stages (MIS 7 and MIS 5). For the first time this shows humid intervals in southwest Arabia coincident with the southern coast. There is a simlar pattern emerging further north in the Arabian Peninsula, The Sinai and Levant and further on into continental Europe. Furthermore, tufa delta O-18 ranges from -14.6 to - 1.9 parts per thousand, covering a range similar to those reported for tufa from north African oasis sites and speleothems elsewhere on the Arabian Peninsula and The Levant. The lowest delta O-18 values are derived from MIS 5e samples, a pattern in agreement with speleothems in Yemen and Oman, and consistent with an isotopic-enabled climate model simulation for this time slice. The delta C-13 and Sr isotopic compositions of dated tufa samples indicate deposition from shallow-circulating meteoric water, with no geothermal influence. This, along with the delta O-18 values, suggest a freshwater supply that was a potable water source in this landscape. The delta C-13 signatures at Wadi Dabsa are more negative than for parts of north Africa, suggesting Wadi Dabsa may have experienced comparatively higher biomass, thicker soils and wetter conditions with lower evaporative losses. This new record of tufa deposition during the middle and late Pleistocene, suggests for the first time that the west coast of Arabia experienced a similar history of humid phases over the past 250 ka as southern Arabia and the Nefud in the northern interior. These regional changes in hydroclimatic regime occur at timescales coincident with hominin dispersals.

However, the use of these organisms to monitor wetland ecosystems has rarely been explored in Western Africa. Whereas, we are currently facing to growing multiple anthropogenic pressures and climate warming that impact negatively our wetlands and the biodiversity. Notably, there is an urgent need of cost-effective tools for wetland ecosystems health assessment in Burkina Faso. In this study, we examined the taxonomic composition of birds, amphibians, fish, and macroinvertebrates and explored their potential use for monitoring wetland ecosystems. From our findings, measures of taxa composition and diversity respond to the gradients of anthropogenic alterations. Our results revealed that the highest diversity of fish and macroinvertebrates taxa was recorded in protected sites, whereas the lowest diversity was obtained in degraded sites. Additionally, the findings showed a strong and positive correlation between macroinvertebrates taxa and key water variables, whereas fish taxa were strongly correlated to xylal (deadwood) substrates. Most of bird's species were recorded in tree-shrubs, and amphibians of protected wetlands were distinguished by identifying indicator taxa through indicator value index. African wetland ecosystems and biodiversity may be sustainably preserved through responsive monitoring programs of wetlands by limnologists.

Disparate biomes within the Caatinga region are not part of the same evolutionary community: A reply to Araujo et al. (2022)	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												In recent attempts to estimate plant and bird species diversity in the Caatinga, the largest nucleus of the Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest and Woodland biome in South America, we called into question a widely used delimitation of this region that includes areas of disparate biomes. We argued that the Caatinga is best delimited without rainforest and savanna enclaves that exist in the region, and that such enclaves should be treated as part of those other biomes rather than part of the Caatinga. In a response to our proposal, Araujo et al. (2022) advocated the continued adoption of that broader delimitation. Here we review Araujo et al.'s (2022) criticism and elaborate on this problem. We demonstrate that using a delimitation of the Caatinga that includes areas of disparate biomes precludes measures of biome-specific information, cross-biome comparisons, and large-scale syntheses, and we argue that such a delimitation is a poor framework for both studies of biological phenom-ena and regional conservation planning.

J	Shi, JW; Tian, ZP; Lang, XM; Jiang, DB				Shi, Jiawen; Tian, Zhiping; Lang, Xianmei; Jiang, Dabang			Past to Future Drylands in China: A Multimodel Analysis Using CMIP6 Simulations	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Using the multimodel simulations from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), we investigate the aridity changes in China and the associated mechanisms during the three geological periods of the Last Interglacial (LIG), Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and mid-Holocene (MH), as well as the three future scenarios of the shared socioeconomic pathways of SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5. The aridity index is used to measure terrestrial mois-ture, which combines the effects of both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET), with the latter representing the amount of water consumed by the atmosphere. The results show that relative to the preindustrial period, the total dry -land area in China varies by -15%, 6%, and -13% during the LIG, LGM, and MH, respectively, and slightly varies in the three future scenarios. Over China, LGM dryland expansion and future dryland contraction are mainly attributed to pre-cipitation changes, MH dryland contraction is mainly caused by PET changes, and LIG dryland contraction is comparably caused by PET and precipitation changes. For the LGM and three future scenarios, temperature is the leading factor of PET changes, while during the MH and LIG, the change in relative humidity is the main factor. In comparison, the simu-lated aridity changes in China are generally consistent with the reconstructed moisture changes for the three past periods, although uncertainties exist in reconstructions during the LGM and MH.																			0894-8755	1520-0442				APR	2023	36	8					2735	2751		10.1175/JCLI-D-22-0720.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-22-0720.1													WOS:000954938300001

Wind Tunnel Tests Reveal Aeolian Relocation Processes Related to Land Cover and Surface Characteristics in the Souss Basin, Morocco	LAND												The Souss Basin is a dryland environment featuring soil, surface and climatic conditions enhancing processes of wind erosion and mineral and organic dust emissions while subject to frequent grazing, tillage and driving. The fine-grained compacted surfaces are covered by physical and biological crusts and stone cover and are sparsely vegetated by open argan woodland and patchily distributed bushes. Wind-tunnel experiments and soil sampling were conducted on the deeply incised alluvial fans originating from High Atlas and Anti-Atlas mountains to investigate the dryland ecosystem, including the open argan woodland, for information on local wind-induced relocation processes and associated dust emission potential. To investigate possible connections between dryland environmental traits and dust emissions, we used two approaches: (a) surface categories (stone cover, crust and cohesionless sand) and (b) Land Cover Classes (wasteland, woodland and wadi). The results indicate omnipresent dynamic aeolian surface processes on a local to regional scale. Wind impact is a powerful trigger for the on-site relocation of available mineral and organic dust and may be crucial to explain the heterogeneous spatial distribution of soil organic carbon and nutrients associated with mineral fines. Aeolian dust flux showed statistically significant relations with surface categories and, to some extent, with Land Cover Classes. While wind erosion processes are key to understanding on-site sediment and nutrient dynamics between fertile dryland islands, the results also indicate a considerable dust emission potential under increasing climate impact and anthropogenic pressure.

A 3-year field experiment was conducted in Loess Plateau to access the effect of tillage and N (nitrogen) rates on soil water, N distribution and water- and nitrogen-use efficiency of winter wheat. Deep tillage (DT, 25-30 cm depth) and no-tillage (NT) were operated during fallow season, whereas four N rates (0, 90, 150 and 210 kg ha(-1)) were applied before sowing. Rates of N and variable rainfall during summer fallow period led to the difference of soil water storage. Soil water storage at anthesis and maturity was decreased with increasing N rate especially in the year with high precipitation (2014-2015). DT has increased the soil water storage at sowing, N content, numbers of spike, grain number, 1,000 grain weight, grain yield, and water and N use efficiency as compared to NT. Grain yield was significantly and positively related to soil water consumption at sowing to anthesis and anthesis to maturity, total plant N, and water-use efficiency. Our study implies that optimum N rate and deep tillage during the fallow season could improve dryland wheat production by balancing the water consumption and biomass production.

We collected two seasons' daily soil loss data from 42 runoff plots. Compared to the control, theP-factor in cropland ranged from 0.15 to 0.53 for soil bund, 0.18 to 0.5 forfanya juu, and 0.06 to 0.44 for soil bund with grass; and in non-cropland plots from 0.03 to 0.42 for trench with exclosure. TheC-factor ranged from 0.004 for teff to 0.64 for chili pepper in crop land; and from 0.001 in degraded bushland to 0.49 in grassland for non-cropland. Overall, the averageP-values decreased in the order midland > highland > lowland for cropland plots and highland > lowland > midland for non-cropland plots.

Towards indigenous community-based adaptation to climate change: a typological analysis of tree-livestock integration in smallholding systems in dryland areas of Benin (West-Africa)	AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS												Integration of livestock farming practices with trees is neglected and poorly explored in the context of climate change (CC) in drylands. However, such knowledge is urgently needed to propose effective strategies in the livestock sector to cope with CC. This study is initiated to characterize the diversity of indigenous integrated livestock systems with trees in drylands of Benin through a survey including 140 smallholder farmers. Descriptive statistics were performed to socio-economic profile of livestock farmers and data were submitted to a multiple correspondence analysis with hierarchical ascending classification and four types of integrated livestock smallholder farmers have been highlighted. The first type is referred to "Traditional silvopastoral systems", consisting of farmers owning high tropical livestock unit (26 & PLUSMN; 0.59 TLU). They did not have land ownership and they exploited trees and shrubs in rangelands and protected areas. They used indigenous trees for treating sick animals and feeding. The second type is ''Improved silvopastoral systems'' with an average of 11 & PLUSMN; 0.21 TLU. They had a land ownership and combined livestock, forage plants and fodder trees in pasturelands. The third type, referred as "Small Integrated agrosilvopastoral systems" consisted of smallholder farmers who integrated agriculture, livestock and tree plantations. They owned a low livestock tropical unit (6 & PLUSMN; 0.24 TLU). The last type qualified as "Large Integrated agrosilvopastoral systems" owned an average of 18 & PLUSMN; 0.34 TLU and cultivated large areas of land. Leguminous trees are used to improve soil fertility and as animal feed. A probit model analysis results indicated that the adoption of trees on livestock farming were influenced by ecological region, membership of association, Land tenure, farm size and herd size. Based on these identified different agroforestry practices of livestock smallholder farmers in the drylands, indigenous community-based adaptation can be designed to face CC.

Pests associated with two brassicaceous oilseeds and a cover crop mix under evaluation as fallow replacements in dryland production systems of the northern Great Plains	CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST												Identifying pests associated with novel crops is important for forecasting impacts on their production and determining if they could be reservoirs of pests moving over onto cash crops. We carried out preliminary pest surveys in two bioenergy crops, carinata (Brassica carinata Alexander Braun (Brassicaceae)) and camelina (Camelina sativa (Linnaeus) Crantz (Brassicaceae)), and a cover crop mix under evaluation to replace fallow in rotations with wheat. Insect pests were sampled in each of the three crops over two years. Crucifer flea beetles, Phyllotreta cruciferae Goeze (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), dominated the pest complex associated with carinata and the cover crop mix, comprising more than 70% of the insects sampled. In contrast, the pest complex associated with camelina was dominated (40-91%) by generalist Lygus spp. (Heteroptera: Miridae). Crucifer flea beetles were 200-1000 times more abundant in carinata than in camelina, suggesting that they could be a serious pest of carinata. Camelina, in contrast, appears less likely to be attacked by, or serve as a reservoir for, crucifer flea beetles. Future work to assess feeding damage and population buildup of pests in these crops is needed to determine impacts on their production and the extent to which they may be reservoirs of canola pests over broader spatial scales.

Soil Management Systems to Overcome Multiple Constraints for Dryland Crops on Deep Sands in a Water Limited Environment on the South Coast of Western Australia	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Deep sands on the south coast sandplain of Western Australia (WA) have multiple soil constraints including water repellence, high soil strength, low nutrient levels and subsoil acidity. The aim of the study was to test contrasting methods of managing water repellence and to assess their impacts on one or more soil constraints to crop production. These methods included seeding tyne design (knife point, winged points, paired row), soil wetting agent addition, strategic inversion tillage (rotary spading, mouldboard ploughing to 0.35 m) and clay-rich subsoil addition (170 t ha(-1) with incorporation by spading to 0.20 or 0.35 m). Limesand (2 t ha(-1)) was applied as a split plot treatment prior to tillage. Cumulative crop yields were increased by 2.1-2.6 t ha(-1) over five years by the strategic deep tillage and clay application treatments compared to the control. Water repellence was reduced by the inversion ploughing and subsoil clay addition treatments only. The effect of water repellence on crop establishment was expressed only in low rainfall years (Decile < 4) and mitigated by the paired row, wetting agent, spader and clay-amended treatments. In all years, plant numbers were adequate to achieve yield potential regardless of treatment. Soil K and plant tissue K and B were increased where clay had been applied. Inversion tillage reduced soil pH, organic carbon (OC) and macro nutrients in the 0-0.1 m layer although in most years there was no significant decline in plant tissue macro nutrient levels. Soil strength was reduced as a result of the inversion tillage to a depth of 0.35 m. However, the alleviation of soil strength and the crop yield responses diminished with time due to re-compaction. No crop response to the applied lime was found over five years at this site since the soil pHCaCl(2) exceeded 4.7 within the root zone. In terms of soil constraints, we conclude that compaction was the dominant constraint at this site followed by water repellence and K deficiency.

However, empirical- and science-based evidence regarding the extent of drought changes and the future trends of these changes in dryland Asia is variable and incomplete. Here, we first investigate the historical variations in drought conditions in dryland Asia, as measured by the drought intensity and arid area, using three widely used drought indices (the Palmer Drought Severity Index, the Standardized Precipitation Index, and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index). Then, we use Bayesian model averaging to reproduce the future drought conditions under two representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP4.5) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 Earth system models. The Palmer Drought Severity Index, Standardized Precipitation Index, and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index illustrate that dryland Asia has experienced an overall drying trend and an expansion of arid areas over the past 100 years (1901-2016). Both temperature and precipitation are projected to increase under both the 1.5 and 2.0 degrees C warming scenarios compared with the values from the reference period (1986-2005). The projected drought conditions in the 1.5 and 2.0 degrees C warming scenarios will worsen, especially across Kazakhstan and Northwest China. We found that the drought conditions under the 2.0 degrees C warming conditions will not be as severe as those under the 1.5 degrees C warming conditions due to the mitigating effect of the projected precipitation increase under RCP4.5. These results call for short-term and long-term mitigation and adaptation measurements for drought events in dryland Asia. Plain Language Summary To avoid the negative impacts of climate warming, the Paris Agreement aims to pursue efforts to maintain the global warming increase at well below 1.5 and even 2.0 degrees C until the end of the century. Questions have been raised regarding the climate extremes in dryland Asia. Will drought issues become more severe under the context of global warming? Are the existing drought indices able to quantify and characterize the drought intensity and arid area in this region? Answers to these questions are crucial for the livelihood of millions of individuals, as these people rely on grassland biomass to feed both animals and farmers; however, the answers remain unclear. Here, we found that the projected drought severity and arid area will persistently increase under both the 1.5 and 2.0 degrees C global warming scenarios. We also found that the drought conditions under the 2.0 degrees C warming scenario will be mitigated relative to those under the 1.5 degrees C warming scenario due to the beneficial effect of adequate precipitation under representative concentration pathway 4.5. Kazakhstan and Northwest China might be severely affected by drought. Therefore, understanding future changes in drought conditions in dryland Asia is critical for developing adaptation measures to cope with the challenges of rapid climate change.

The use of well-calibrated and validated crop models with climate change data is important for assessing climate change impacts and developing adaptation strategies. In this study, the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer (DSSAT) crop model was used to predict yield using observed and projected climate data.Materials and Methods: Climate, soil, and crop management data were collected from wheat-growing study sites in Bethlehem, South Africa. The DSSAT wheat model (CROPSIM-CERES) used was already calibrated, and validated by Serage et al. (Evaluating Climate Change Adaptation Strategies for Disaster Risk Management: Case Study for Bethlehem Wheat Farmers, South Africa, 2017) using three wheat cultivar coefficients obtained from the cultivar adaptation experiment by the ARC-Small Grain Institute. The model was run with historical climate data for the eastern Free State (Bethlehem) from 1999 to 2018 as the baseline period. To determine the effects of climate change, the crop model simulation for wheat was run with future projections from four Global Climate Models (GCM): BCC-CSM1_1, GFDL-ESM2G, ENSEMBLE, and MIROC from 2020 to 2077.Results: The average wheat yield for the historic climate data was 1145.2 kg/ha and was slightly lower than the highest average yield of 1215.9 kg/ha from GCM ENSEMBLE during Representative concentration pathways (RCP) 2.6, while the lowest yield of 29.8 kg/ha was produced during RCP 8.5 (GCM GFDL-ESM2G). Model GFDL-ESM2G produced low yields (29.8-47.74 kg/ha) during RCP 8.5 and RCP 6.0, respectively. The yield range for GCM BCC-CSM1_1 was 770.2 kg/ha during RCP 2.6 to 921.68 kg/ha during RCP 4.5 and 547.84 kg/ha during RCP 8.5 to 700.22 kg/ha during RCP 2.6 for GCM MIROC.Conclusion: This study showed a declining trend in yield for future climate projections from RCP2.6 to RCP8.5, indicating that the possible impacts of higher temperatures and reduced rainfall in the projected future climate will slightly decrease wheat production in the eastern Free State. Adaptation measures to mitigate the potential impact of climate change could include possible changes in planting dates and cultivars. Using a crop model to simulate the response of crops to variations in weather conditions can be useful to generate advisories for farmers to prevent low yield.					ajilogba, caroline/GSN-1425-2022; Ajilogba, Caroline/JNS-4436-2023															2296-665X				JUL 17	2023	11								1067008	10.3389/fenvs.2023.1067008	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1067008													WOS:001040717100001

Tillage timing to improve soil water storage in Mediterranean long fallow	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Creation of a dry soil mulch to maintain near-surface moisture in dry environments is an ancient practice that is still used in many regions of the world for timely establishment of crops after long fallow. Before availability of herbicides, the first tillage during fallow was timed to kill weeds, but now the optimum timing for tillage depends only on the interplay of evaporation and infiltration of rain. The goal is to maximize total root zone water storage and seed-zone water at seeding time. Our objective was to measure the effect of delaying soil mulch creation progressively later in the spring and summer on weed-free fallow for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the Mediterranean inland Pacific Northwest drylands of the United States. Over a period of six years and a total of 12 site-years, four to seven tillage timings were compared to an untilled treatment. Soil water was measured at seeding time in the seed zone and total root zone. Seed-zone water and total stored water produced by different tillage timings was surprisingly constant, with few statistically significant or substantial differences. On average, only 2% of stored water was lost in the top 1.0 m of soil over 80 days during the hot, dry period towards the end of fallow. Responses to late spring rain could be seen, and tillage near the end of June (early summer) often produced maximum soil water content.

J	Idol, T				Idol, Travis			A short review of leucaena as an invasive species in Hawaii	TROPICAL GRASSLANDS-FORRAJES TROPICALES					International Leucaena Conference (ILC)	OCT 29-NOV 03, 2018	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA	Univ Queensland				Leucaena leucocephala subsp. leucocephala was introduced to Hawaii after European settlement and spread widely for cattle fodder and fuelwood. As in many other tropical locations where it has been introduced, it has naturalized and spread in disturbed and drier habitats. While it is common in disturbed areas, it is much less common in intact native dry forests. It is resilient to wildfire and mammalian grazing, which conversely threaten the integrity of remnant native dryland forest. The successional trajectory of areas dominated by leucaena has not been well studied in Hawaii, but it is probable that other non-native rather than native species will replace it. As a result of its widespread distribution, especially on steep slopes, priority for its eradication or control is low. Current biocontrol options are limited in effectiveness. Control of leucaena can and should be given greater priority to protect native dryland forests and inhibit spread of seeds. Restoration of dryland habitats requires intensive, sustained efforts, usually involving volunteers. Combining cultural and/or use values in restoration projects holds promise for stimulating and sustaining community involvement.																			2346-3775					SEP	2019	7	4			SI		290	294		10.17138/TGFT(7)290-294	http://dx.doi.org/10.17138/TGFT(7)290-294													WOS:000484380800005
J	Mauget, S; Ulloa, M; Mitchell-McCallister, D				Mauget, Steven; Ulloa, Mauricio; Mitchell-McCallister, Donna			Simulated irrigation water productivity and related profit effects in US Southern High Plains cotton production	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												To explore management practices that increase irrigation water productivity (IWP) in U.S. Southern High Plains (SHP) cotton production, the CROPGRO-Cotton crop simulation model was used to evaluate the yield, IWP, and profit effects of irrigation amount and timing. Using 2005-2019 weather input data from 21 SHP weather stations, lint yields were simulated for each of the 315 station-years under unirrigated 'dryland' conditions and 18 increasing total irrigation (TIRR) levels. As TIRR was increased to 55.9 cm median lint yields asymptotically approached a maximum. However, irrigation above 35.6 cm increased the incidence of total irrigation plus growing season rainfall exceeding 100% of potential crop ET, leading to decreasing marginal yield effects and decreasing IWP. The highest median IWP (0.321 kg m(-3)) was found with both 33.0 and 35.6 cm of total irrigation, with 30.5 cm providing slightly lower IWP (0.320 kg m(-3)). In analyses of irrigated profitability under varying lint price and pumping cost conditions, 30.5 cm (12.0 in) of irrigation increases profits relative to dryland conditions under all but low lint price and high pumping cost conditions. But as TIRR is reduced the probability of these positive profit effects become similar to an evenly weighted coin flip at about 17.8 cm (7.0 in). Simulations that varied the timing of 30.5 cm of irrigation increased median IWP up to 0.434 kg m(-3) by limiting irrigation to cotton's reproductive and maturation periods, with no irrigation during the initial vegetative period. As a result, these simulations show that applying 30.5-35.6 cm (12.0-14.0 in) of irrigation during cotton's reproductive and maturation phases, with little or no vegetative irrigation, maximizes IWP in SHP cotton production under current climate conditions.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				MAY 31	2022	266								107582	10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107582	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107582		MAR 2022											WOS:000793038100003

An R tool was developed in this study for batch processing of SWAT output results. A case study was then performed in the Double Mountain Fork Brazos watershed in the Texas Panhandle using an improved SWAT model with the R tool to evaluate the simulated future changes in water balance components, total nitrogen (TN) load, and crop growth over the watershed. The results showed that the average annual future surface runoff increased by 8.9-17.9 mm and 11.5-22.6 mm in the irrigated and dryland cotton areas, respectively. Similarly, future TN load in irrigated and dryland cotton areas increased by approximately 0.4-0.9 kg ha(-1) and 1.9-2.4 kg ha(-1). The yields of irrigated and dryland cotton increased by 91.1%-122.1% and 47.5%-84.0% under the future climate scenarios, respectively.

Increasing global aridity destabilizes shrub facilitation of exotic but not native plant species	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Earth's dryland (hyper-arid, arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid) ecosystems face increasing aridity and invasion by exotic plant species. In concert, these global changes threaten the biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and economic viability of drylands worldwide, with critical implications for environmental quality and human wellbeing. Positive interactions (facilitation) from shrubs can buffer native plant communities against increasing aridity, but this could backfire if exotic species are facilitated more than natives. Thus, understanding how native and exotic plant species respond to shrub facilitation along aridity gradients is essential for predicting the ecological consequences of concomitant aridification and exotic plant invasion in changing drylands. Here, we performed meta-analyses using 152 independent studies to compare the positive effects of shrubs on native vs. exotic plant species across Earth's dryland ecosystems that vary in aridity. Globally, shrubs facilitate the abundance, diversity, reproduction, and survival of native plant species but do not consistently facilitate any measure of exotic plant performance. As aridity increases, shrub effects on native species do not change, but shrub effects on exotic species become more negative. Thus, across dryland ecosystems globally, shrubs facilitate more measures of native plant performance than exotic plant performance, and as aridity increases, shrub facilitation remains stable for native species but transitions towards resistance for exotic species. At the global scale, dryland aridification may pose a greater threat to exotic species than native species, inasmuch as shrubs and their interactions remain intact.

Precipitation was measured using rain gauges evenly distributed over the study catchment. Event peak discharges were measured with crest-stage gauges at a reference cross-section. Changes in channel width were measured at six monitoring sites along a 1.5 km long reach. Decadal channel width change was analyzed over the period 1965-2014. The average rainfall depth of the rainy days was 14.2 +/- 9.4 mm whereas the highest was 41.9 mm and the lowest, capable to generate some flow in the river, was only 1.8 mm. The maximum calculated discharge peaked at 408 m(3)/s whereas the lowest flow was 19.5 m(3)/s. An average widening of 0.11 +/- 0.19 m per flood (for a total of 3.74 m) was measured. The cumulative precipitation and cumulative channel widening suggest that larger and longer lasting rains have substantial influence on channel width change. A marked increase in channel width commonly accompanies 2-3 days of flood duration; it is less marked where there is riparian vegetation on the banks. The long-term (1965, 1986, 2005, and 2010) measurements indicate that channel width increased rapidly over the last 50 years; nearly 25 m of widening. Generally, channel changes are mainly induced by the duration of floods rather than by their intensity and the data clearly show that ephemeral streams channel dynamics can be triggered also by floods much smaller than bankfull.

Although previous studies have analysed its spatiotemporal dynamics at long time intervals, a near real-time and accurate representation of the interannual evolution of cropping patterns in this region is of far-reaching importance for rationally allocating agricultural resources and ensuring food security. Based on the 30 m and 10 m land cover datasets in 2015 and 2017-2019, the current study used Landsat-8 satellite data in 2014, 2016 and 2020 to identify paddy rice and dryland crops using a decision tree classification approach and constructed the annual cropland datasets of the Sanjiang Plain from 2014 to 2020. The results show that the overall classification accuracies of crop datasets exceeded 95%, and the Kappa coefficients were higher than 0.92. The average annual accuracies of users and producers were 93% and 94% for rice fields and 97% and 95% for dryland crops, respectively. During the 7 years, the total area of paddy fields and dryland crops decreased by 5% and 8%. However, with minor positive and negative variation between years. 24.2% of paddy rice and 42% of dryland crops has been cultivated under 4 years. The centres of gravity for both crops mainly aggregated in the central counties with the migration direction and magnitude varying interannually. The current study emphasizes the importance of establishing annual high-resolution crop datasets to track the detailed spatio-temporal trajectories of cropping patterns that are essential to support sustainable cropland management and agricultural development.					wang, xiao/HZI-9156-2023; Zhang, Zeyu/HTO-6741-2023; cai, hongyan/Y-8555-2019														0021-8596	1469-5146				2023 FEB 16	2023									PII S002185962300014X	10.1017/S002185962300014X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S002185962300014X		FEB 2023											WOS:000949680000001

However, applicability and performance of these models differ across regions, due to differences in environmental and management factors. The AquaCrop model was used to simulate soil water content (SWC), evapotranspiration (ET), and yield for grain sorghum under different irrigation regimes and dryland conditions at two sites in Central and Southern High Plains. Prediction error (P-e), estimated as the difference between simulated and measured divided by measured, for SWC ranged from -17% to 4% in fully irrigated, -3% to -10% in limited irrigated, and -16% to 25% in dryland treatments. The P-e within +/- 4%, -5%, and -17% to 24% were attained for seasonal ET under fully irrigated, limited irrigated, and dryland conditions, respectively. P-e values for grain yield were within those previously reported and ranged from -10% to 12%, -12% to 7%, and 9% to 17% for fully irrigated, limited irrigated and dryland conditions, respectively. Overall performance of the AquaCrop model showed it could be used as an effective tool for evaluating the impacts of variable crop and irrigation managements on the production of grain sorghum in the study area. Finally, the application of the model in the study area revealed planting date has a significant impact on sorghum yield and irrigation requirements, but the impact of planting density was negligible.

We evaluated the efficacy of creating high-resolution, broad-scale indicators of yield from simple models that combine yield mapping data, a precision agriculture tool, with the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Landsat 5 and 7 ETM+ imagery. These models were then generalised to test its potential operationalisation across a large agricultural region (>1/2 million hectares) and the state of South Australia (>8 million hectares). Annual models were the best predictors of yield across both areas. Moderate discrimination accuracy in the regional analysis meant that models could be extrapolated with reasonable spatial precision, whereas the accuracy across the state-wide analysis was poor. Generalisation of these models to further operationalise the methodology by removing the need for crop type discrimination and the continual access to annual yield data showed some benefit. The application of this approach with past and contemporary datasets can create a long-term archive that fills an information void, providing a powerful evidence base to inform current management decisions and future on-farm land use in cropping regions elsewhere.

Terrestrial cyanobacteria have evolved with cold adaptability in addition to extreme dryness and high irradiation resistance. The dryland soil surface-dwelling species,Nostoc flagelliforme, serves as a potential model organism to gain insights into cyanobacterial cold adaptation. In this study, we performed transcriptomic analysis ofN.flagelliformesamples in response to low temperature. The results revealed that the biological processes, such as terpenoid biosynthetic process, oxidoreductase activity, carbohydrate metabolism, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, lipid and nitrogen metabolism, were significantly and dynamically changed during the cold stress. It was noteworthy that the transcription of the denitrification pathway for ammonia accumulation was enhanced, implying an importance for nitrogen utilization in stress resistance. In addition, characterization of a cold-responsive hypothetical genecsrnf1found that it could greatly improve the cold-resistant performance of cells when it was heterologously expressed in transgenicNostocsp.

Considering that dryland cyanobacteria have to cope with low temperature on infertile soils, this study would enrich our understanding on the importance of multifunction of the genes for environmental cold adaptation in drylands.

Yield prediction in the early growth stages significantly informs field management decisions for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). A 10-year field experiment carried out in the Loess Plateau area tested how three tillage practices (deep ploughing (DP), subsoiling (SS), and no tillage (NT)) influenced cultivation and yield across different fallow periods. The experiment used the random forest (RF) algorithm to construct a prediction model of yields and yield components. Our results revealed that tillage during the fallow period was more effective than NT in improving yield in dryland wheat. Under drought condition, DP during the fallow period achieved a higher yield than SS, especially in drought years; DP was 16% higher than SS. RF was deemed fit for yield prediction across different precipitation years. An RF model was developed using meteorological factors for fixed variables and soil water storage after tillage during a fallow period for a control variable. Small error values existed in the prediction yield, spike number, and grains number per spike. Additionally, the relative error of crop yield under fallow tillage (5.24%) was smaller than that of NT (6.49%). The prediction error of relative meteorological yield was minimum and optimal, indicating that the model is suitable to explain the influence of meteorological factors on yield.

However, there is limited knowledge on the current spatial status of drylands, which can be assessed using updated and more rigorous data than information used in the initial dryland estimations. Here we investigate the current extent of drylands globally, continentally and nationally by analysing one of the most recent aridity database (1950-2000 period) and compare statistically, for the first time, with the initial dryland estimations (1951-1980). Using diachronic analysis between the databases, we found that drylands are currently almost 4% larger worldwide than expected and cover 45.4% of the Earth's land surface. This net increase of global dryland areas is due to the expansion of arid (+3.4%) and semi-arid (+0.9%) areas, whilst hyper-arid zones decreased (-0.8%) and dry sub-humid areas remained stable. Except for Europe and South America, all continents have experienced a net expansion of arid environments in the recent climate database. Our findings show that Asia is home to the world's largest increases in dryland areas, where China alone accounts for almost one third of the new lands exposed to aridity worldwide. The Earth's drier conditions can generally be attributed to climate changes occurring after 1980. Our results highlight large-scale drying processes and therefore the exacerbation of land degradative conditions at low and middle latitudes. Also, our findings signal the danger of triggering certain positive feedbacks in global warming, considering the newly-identified drylands migration towards higher latitudes in North America and Asia, which can modify the albedo and destabilize the large carbon pools in permafrost, peatlands or boreal forests.

Temporal variations on NDVI predict temporal changes in vegetation cover across Patagonian drylands (Argentina)	ECOSISTEMAS												Temporal variations on NDVI predict temporal changes in vegetation cover across Patagonian drylands (Argentina). In drylands, natural vegetation is an important source of livelihood as they provide food, fuel and forage for livestock. In addition to the provision of goods and services, dryland vegetation also plays an important role in many ecological processes, such as recycling nutrients or protecting the soil from erosion. Long-term monitoring of vegetation cover is therefore key for decision-making and management of these regions. In this study, we analyze the variation of vegetation cover in 239 sites of a long-term monitoring network (MARAS network), in one of the largest dryland biomes in the world: the argentine patagonian steppe. Then we relate it to the variation of different periods of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), obtained from the MODIS sensor, which serve as a predictor variable. The adjusted empirical model explained up to 40% of the variation in the vegetation cover measured in the field. With this simple empirical model we have estimated and mapped temporal changes in the vegetation cover of a large dryland biome at low cost.

However, the responses of drylands degradation to anthropogenic ecosystem changes remain unclear. This study proposes a new perspective of the 'oxygen footprint', defined as the ratio between oxygen consumption and oxygen production, which could be regarded as an indicator in evaluating the effects of anthropogenic climate change on global dryland ecosystems. A global distribution of the trend of oxygen footprint in response to climate change indicators and the transformations for ecosystem functioning is presented. The response of oxygen footprint to human activities and global warming is projected to enhance in the 21st century. Under a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5), linear regression analysis between oxygen footprint and other indicators shows oxygen footprint to increase with the increase of air temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and dryland areas, respectively. Our study suggests that when oxygen production is unsustainable combined with oxygen consumption, this scenario will accelerate the degradation of dryland ecosystem, with fundamental and negative consequences for the capacity of drylands to supply essential ecosystem services.

Enhancing Maize Yield and Resource Efficiency through Controlled-Release Nitrogen Fertilization on the Semiarid Loess Plateau	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Drought stress is one of the premier limitations to global agricultural production. Increasing water and nitrogen (N) use efficiencies in dryland agroecosystems to maintain high agricultural output are key responsibilities to assure food security, especially on the semiarid Loess Plateau region of China, as it is one of the important grain production areas in China. The impact of controlled-release urea (CRU) on the soil water content, soil enzyme activities, soil N content, biomass accumulation, grain yield, water use efficiency (WUE), and agronomic use efficiency of N fertilizer (AEN) were examined on the maize production of the rainfed Loess Plateau during 2020-2021. Two-growing-season field treatments at the Zhengyuan Agri-ecological Station, Qingyang, Gansu, including six N treatments, were investigated for maize: a control without N fertilization (CK) and five application proportions of CRU (i.e., 0, 30, 50, 70, and 100%CRU) under a N rate of 225 kg ha-1. Results showed that compared with common urea (0%CRU), on average, CRU applications significantly increased soil enzyme activity related to N conversion and improved biomass accumulation by 4-11% at the silking stage and by 2-12% at the maturity stage, respectively. As the proportion of CRU increased, the grain no. per ear, 100-grain weight, and harvest index first increased and then decreased. Grain yield was increased by 5.3, 11.4, 20.1, and 5.7% under 30, 50, 70 and 100%CRU, respectively, compared to common urea. Compared to common urea, 70%CRU combined with 30% common urea achieved the highest yield. These results indicate that optimal controlled-release N fertilization increases the yield and water and nitrogen use efficiencies of maize, and 70%CRU combined with 30% common urea under a single application of nitrogen fertilizer at sowing was the optimal application proportion of controlled-release urea for increasing water and nitrogen use efficiencies in dryland agroecosystems. The results of this study can provide a theoretical basis for the efficient fertilization of maize on the semiarid Loess Plateau of China.

Transformational adaptation in drylands	CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY												Global drylands comprise over 40% of the earth's land surface, support millions of pastoralists and account for half of the world's livestock. Climate change and socio-economic drivers are rapidly altering dryland social-ecological systems, with the potential to increase vulnerability. This article describes forces of change in drylands and the social changes observed in pastoralist dryland systems, with a focus on Africa. The observed changes point to changes in values, social/gender relations, livelihoods and institutions, all fundamental elements of transformational adaptation.

Materials and Methods: Energy intake was calculated as the bite mass x number of bites x ME per bite. Daily energy expenditure was calculated as the sum of the expenditures incurred for maintenance, grazing, and thermoregulating, as well as during pregnancy. We also investigated the sheep nutrition indicators (body condition and blood biochemical parameters) before and after winter. Results and Discussion: Average daily bite number, bite weight, and daily feed ME of sheep were 12,094, 53 mg in March, and 1.16 Mcal, respectively, and thus, total daily ME of intake was 0.86 Mcal. The daily energy expenditure for maintenance, grazing, thermoregulation, and fetus were 1.58, 1.56, 2.27, and 0.41 Mcal, respectively, accounting for a total daily energy expenditure per sheep of 5.82 Mcal. The total protein (70.2 to 49.1 g/L), albumin (37.4 to 16.9 g/L), and leptin contents (37.1 to 10.9 ng/mL) in the blood decreased remarkably after winter. Implications and Applications: The energy intake and expenditure results showed that the estimated total negative daily energy balance was 4.96 Mcal/d during the winter season. These results indicated that Mongolian sheep did not maintain a sufficient energy balance during winter and, thereby, required compensation for the negative energy balance using their body fat and protein stores.																			2590-2873	2590-2865				OCT	2021	37	5					589	594		10.15232/aas.2021-02137	http://dx.doi.org/10.15232/aas.2021-02137		SEP 2021											WOS:000702861700010

Estimating and attributing benefits from wheat varietal innovations in South African agriculture	AGREKON												It is well accepted that biological innovations, particularly varietal improvements, have greatly contributed to agricultural yield and output growth in the past. At the same time, public funding for breeding programmes such as at the Agricultural Research Council in South Africa has dwindled. In an effort to confirm the importance of continued funding of varietal improvement programmes, this paper estimates the benefits from wheat varietal innovations and attributes them to the different institutional sources (public, private and others) that have contributed to varietal changes in South Africa. The empirical analyses used data on market shares of wheat varieties planted by farmers and annual quantities of wheat produced across different wheat-production areas in South Africa (summer dryland, dryland winter, and irrigation). A vintage regression model was estimated to calculate the proportional yield gain from wheat varietal improvements. The results indicated that the rate of gain in yield as a result of releases of new wheat varieties (variety research) was 0.8 per cent per year (equivalent to 19.84 kg/ha/year) for dryland summer varieties, and 0.5 per cent for both irrigation (equivalent to 32.20 kg/ha/year) and dryland winter varieties (equivalent to 16.65 kg/ha/year). The attribution of benefits among different institutional sources confirms that not accounting for attribution of benefits by source and time period results is overestimation of benefits to any specific research programme. Attribution of benefits by institutional source showed that Sensako dominated, while the share of the ARC-SGI substantially declined, after deregulation of the wheat sub-sector. The results highlight the impact of the decline in public funding for wheat variety improvement research after deregulation and provide a strong argument for continued public funding for variety improvement in South Africa.

Environmental rehabilitation, culminating in the reestablishment of tree cover, is seen as improving ecological functioning and in so doing, reducing the vulnerability of the poor who rely on these agroecosystems. This is what we refer to as the win-win vision for afforestation, reforestation, and revegetation (ARR) programs - increases in ecological resiliency will lead to increases in social resiliency. This highly appealing vision cannot be realized unless one takes seriously the two basic premises. First, to reduce the vulnerability of a rural population, even in rural areas of the Sahel, one must develop strategies to improve the conditions of the most vulnerable. Second, technical success in terms of ecological rehabilitation will not automatically reduce the vulnerability of the most vulnerable and may in fact directly or indirectly exacerbate their vulnerability. Thus, for ARR programs to approach their win-win goals, one must be attentive not only to their technical success, but also to their social consequences for the rural poor. The Great Green Wall program is the most ambitious ARR program in sub-Saharan Africa. It seeks to rehabilitate degraded lands and reduce the vulnerability of the rural poor in dryland West Africa. We reviewed project documents from twelve country programs of the World Bank's Sahel and West Africa Program (SAWAP) initiative that falls under the visionary umbrella of the Great Green Wall. Our approach was to treat these project documents as "research sites," allowing us to not only consider how these projects conceptualize the relationships between vulnerability environmental rehabilitation but also to identify the activities and outcomes that projects attend to and measure their success by. In general, attention was narrowly focused on achieving the technical goals of ARR with outcomes primarily measured by numbers of trees planted, hectares restored, and people trained. We looked for evidence in these documents of efforts and strategies used to identify and target benefits to the most vulnerable. We found little evidence in project design and evaluation of attention to the differential vulnerabilities of particular livelihood and demographic groups nor to the potential for these projects to serve as mechanisms of enclosure to benefit powerful local interests. Rapid rural appraisal at nine ARR sites in Niger revealed little attention to the needs of the most vulnerable with some of the most vulnerable either excluded (women with absent husbands) or ignored (pastoralists). Moreover, ARR activities often led to the direct and indirect enclosure of reclaimed sites benefiting powerful individuals. Options to improve these programs are discussed.

Conventionally, crop modeling work has evaluated the effect of climatic parameters on crop growth, without considering CO2. It is conjectured that a novel multimodal ensemble approach may improve the accuracy of modelled responses to eCO(2). To demonstrate the applicability of a multimodel ensemble of crop models to simulation of eCO(2), APSIM, CropSyst, DSSAT, EPIC and STICS were calibrated to observed data for crop phenology, biomass and yield. Significant variability in simulated biomass production was shown among the models particularly at dryland sites (44%) compared to the irrigated site (22%). Increased yield was observed for all models with the highest average yield at dryland site by EPIC (49%) and lowest under irrigated conditions (17%) by APSIM and CropSyst. For the ensemble, maximum yield was 45% for the dryland site and a minimum 22% at the irrigated site. We concluded from our study that process-based crop models have variability in the simulation of crop response to [eCO(2)] with greater difference under water-stressed conditions. We recommend the use of ensembles to improve accuracy in modeled responses to [eCO(2)].

The arms increase the power loss of VAWTs; however, the distribution between the pressure and friction influences and their degrees of influence have not yet been investigated in detail in past research. We applied computational fluid dynamics (CFD) targeting a small-sized straight-bladed VAWT to elucidate the effects of arms on turbine performance. In the analysis, three kinds of arms with different cross-sections (NACA 0018 airfoil, 18% rectangular, circular) with the same height were added to an armless rotor. The tangential forces and resistance torques caused by the added arms were recalculated by dividing the pressure and friction influences based on the surface pressure and friction distributions obtained by the CFD on an arm or a blade. The pressure-based tangential force of an arm, regardless of the cross-section, had a tendency to increase near the connection part between the arm and a blade. Though the value was small, the friction on the rectangular arm generated a driving force, whereas the friction on the other arms generated resistance forces. The pressure-based tangential force of a blade increased for a wide region around the connection part. The friction-based tangential force of a blade dropped around the connection part of every arm-equipped rotor. The arm resistance torque added to a VAWT by the existence of arms was larger than the added blade resistance torque in the cases of rectangular and circular arm rotors. Conversely, in the case of the airfoil arm rotor, the resistance torque added to blades became larger than that of arms.

J	Fischer, A; Sanderson, M				Fischer, Amariah; Sanderson, Matthew			Water, culture, and adaptation in the High Plains-Ogallala Aquifer region	JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES												We investigate how the physical water environment shapes water conservation norms among farmers in the High Plains-Ogallala Aquifer, the largest source of groundwater in the United States. We approach these questions in terms of cultural adaptation to the physical environment, comparing irrigators with dryland farmers using survey and environmental data. We use the values-beliefs-norms (VBN) framework to develop a conceptual model to integrate the physical water context as an exogenous explanation of water conservation norms. Grouped simultaneous equations models indicate a limited form of cultural adaptation in the region that, from a biological perspective, could be considered evidence of mal-adaptation. Both irrigators and dryland operators in more water-rich environments hold stronger water conservation norms and those in more arid environments hold weaker water conservation norms. For irrigators, the relationship between the water context and norms is partially mediated by worldviews: irrigators in more water scarce contexts tend to hold more ecocentric worldviews that motivate conservation. The findings suggest the importance of considering farmers' practices (dryland farming or irrigation) and their places (physical water context) in shaping their decision-making in an integrated socio-ecological context.																			0743-0167	1873-1392				OCT	2022	95						195	207		10.1016/j.jrurstud.2022.08.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2022.08.004		SEP 2022											WOS:000888855500004

Here we explored the potential of the synergistic use of SMAP and OCO-2 based data for monitoring the responses of ecosystem productivity to drought. We used complementary observational information on root-zone soil moisture and GPP (9 km) from SMAP and fine-resolution SIF (0.05 degrees; GOSIF) derived from OCO-2 SIF soundings. We compared the spatial pattern and temporal evolution of anomalies of these variables over the conterminous U.S. during the 2018 drought, and examined to what extent they could characterize the drought-induced variations of flux tower GPP and crop yield data. Our results showed that SMAP GPP and GOSIF, both freely available online, could well capture the spatial extent and dynamics of the impacts of drought indicated by the U.S. Drought Monitor maps and the SMAP root-zone soil moisture deficit. Over the U.S. Southwest, monthly anomalies of soil moisture showed significant positive correlations with those of SMAP GPP (R-2 = 0.44, p < 0.001) and GOSIF (R-2 = 0.76, p < 0.001), demonstrating strong water availability constraints on plant productivity across dryland ecosystems. We further found that SMAP GPP and GOSIF captured the impact of drought on tower GPP and crop yield. Our results suggest that synergistic use of SMAP and OCO-2 data products can reveal the drought evolution and its impact on ecosystem productivity and carbon uptake at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and demonstrate the value of SMAP and OCO-2 for studying ecosystem function, carbon cycling, and climate change.

We are developing a new aqua-ponics system to improve food productivity on such lands while effectively utilizing saline groundwater. In this study, cultivation of Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris L. spp. cicla cv. Seiyou Shirokuki) was carried out using fish wastewater with a high salt concentration (1150 mg L-1 NaCl). The levels of microelements (e.g., Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu) in the fish wastewater were very low, so we added microelements at 100% (W100), 50% (W50), 25% (W25), and 0% (W0) of the levels in the standard hydroponics solution to the fish wastewater and investigated the effects on growth of Swiss chard. At the first harvest, yields in all wastewater treatments were as high or higher than in the control. At the second harvest, yields in W100, W50, and W25 were not significantly different from the control, while in W0 the yield was significantly lower and chlorosis was evident. At the third harvest, the yield in all wastewater treatments was less than in the control, and chlorosis symptoms were observed in W25 and W0. Since leaf Mn and Zn concentrations in W25 and W0 had decreased to below the critical values for those microelements, Mn and Zn deficiency might have contributed to the observed chlorosis and yield loss. For the cultivation of Swiss chard with fish wastewater, sufficient yield (i.e., comparable to or better than the control) without chlorosis was obtained when microelements were added at 50% of the level of the control solution. In addition, since sufficient yield was obtained even in W0 at the first harvest, it is suggested that longer-term cultivation and higher yield could be achieved by applying 50% microelements after the first harvest.

Central Asia (CA) has the largest temperate grassland belt in the world and unique temperate dryland ecosystems, which experienced severe climate change and grazing-induced disturbances. However, the impact of grazing on C dynamics is highly uncertain owing to climate variations. Here, an arid ecosystem model (AEM) supplemented with a grazing module that specifically addressed physiological and ecological characteristics of dryland vegetation was developed to quantitatively simulate grassland C dynamics in response to changes in precipitation, temperature, grazing intensity, and CO2 level in the past decades. The regional simulation results showed that net primary productivity (NPP) was affected mainly by precipitation (in 59% of the studied area). Grazing had a negative effect on NPP and C stocks, whereas overcompensation occurred in 25.71% of the studied area, mainly in the dry western parts. The complex interaction effects of climate, CO2, and grazing negatively affected productivity, with a grassland NPP decrease of - 1.14 g C/m(2)/a and high interannual variability. We found that the temporal pattern of cumulative C sequestration, especially total C and vegetation C (VEGC), closely followed the annual fluctuations of precipitation. VEGC stocks decreased from 182.22 to 177.82 g C/m(2), with a very low value between 1998 and 2008, when precipitation significantly decreased. The results indicate that southern Xinjiang and the Turgay Plateau of Kazakhstan are ecologically fragile areas due to grassland degradation.

It is imperative to quantify and mitigate the intermittency/variability of wind energy for research community as well as industry, but there are no consensus methods yet. The present study took the first attempt to quantify the cost of the variability/intermittency of wind energy with battery energy storage system, aiming at comprehensively assessing the spatial distribution of the exploitability of wind energy in China. The research found that the most abundant wind resources are located in Tibet Plateau, Hexi Corridor, Inner Mongolia in considering the abundance of wind resources, land use type, and landforms, as well as the variability of wind energy. In the near future, wind farms with the advanced energy storage technology in 2030 or 2050 could provide stable wind energy with marketing comparable prices, which is lower than the price of current coal-fired electricity (about 0.5 CNY/kWh). It is worth to note that the variability of wind energy in Qinghai Tibet Plateau could lead to high demanding of storage capacity and therefore unaffordable cost. The proposed methodology can be applied in different regions worldwide. The results of this study could also be a scientific foundation for policy makers for wind power development in China mainland.

The research area is located in Baiduo village in the dolomite karst region and Shiqiao village in the limestone karst region of Shibing County, Guizhou Province, China. The land-use types investigated included shrubland, forest, grass slope, dryland, paddy field, pear orchard, and flue-cured tobacco field. The contents of organic carbon, total nitrogen, alkaline hydrolysable nitrogen, and available potassium, as well as the pH of the soil in the dolomite shrubland, were higher than those in the limestone shrubland. The total potassium, total phosphorus, and available phosphorus contents of soil in the limestone shrubland were higher than those in the dolomite shrubland. Among the four types of land-use most strongly affected by human activities (paddy field, dryland, flue-cured tobacco field, and pear orchard), the nutrient contents (except potassium in the upper soil layer) were higher than those in the lower layer. The differences in nutrient contents between upper and lower layers were relatively small in the dryland and the pear orchard, whereas they were large for the paddy field and flue-cured tobacco field. The gray relational degree of various land-use types decreased in the following order: dolomite shrubland > forest > grass slope > pear orchard > limestone shrubland > paddy field > dryland > flue-cured tobacco field. The dolomite shrubland had the best soil quality, while the flue-cured tobacco field had the worst. Of the four types of land use most strongly affected by human activities, pear orchard had the best soil quality. This study can provide reference for soil nutrient management and sustainable management in karst areas.

J	Karasakal, A				Karasakal, Arda			Composted organic manure replacement probability using chemical fertilizer in organic Safflower farming	BIOSCIENCE RESEARCH												To determine the possibility of composted organic manure being substituted for chemical fertilizer in organic safflower farming, an experiment was performed at Shirvan's Islamic Azad University during the 2018-2019 growing season. Vermicompost, urban waste compost, farmyard manure, and chemical fertilizer were used as treatments in two different irrigated and dryland conditions. The experiment used a split-plot design with three replications based on a randomized full block design. Irrigation treatments are concentrated in the main plot, whereas fertilizer treatments are concentrated in the subplot. Each subplot had a width and length of 2 and 3 meters, respectively. Several unique agronomic characteristics were observed throughout the growing season and after harvest. Even though irrigation had no significant impact on seed production, seed yield was 18% higher in the irrigated treatment than dryland treatment. The highest seed yields in the irrigated treatment were obtained using chemical fertilizer (203 kg/h), 50 tons/h farmyard manure (1883 kg/h), 10 tons/h vermicompost (1860 kg/h), and 5 tons/h urban waste compost (1813 kg/h), which did not differ significantly from each other but produced 35%, 22.5 %, 21%, and 18% more seed yields, respectively when compared to the control. In irrigated conditions, the smallest quantity of urban waste compost (5 tons/h) generated seed yields nearly identical to those produced by 10 tons/h vermicompost and 50 tons/h farmyard manure. In dryland treatment at a rate of 15 tons/h, urban waste compost outperformed control and chemical fertilizer by 35%. As a consequence of the experiment's findings, Safflower demonstrated a superior response to urban waste compost in irrigated and dryland conditions.

Carboniferous-Permian climate change constrained early land vertebrate radiations	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION												The Carboniferous-Permian transition (CPT) was Earth's last pre-Quaternary icehouse-greenhouse transition, recording major shifts in late Palaeozoic climate regimes and increased continental seasonality over approximately 40 Myr. Its parallels to Quaternary climate change have inspired recent investigations into the impacts of purported rainforest collapse on palaeotropical vertebrate diversity, but little is known about how the protracted spatial dynamics of this transition impacted the emergence of modern tetrapod lineages. Here, we apply ecological ordinance analyses on a dataset of 286 CPT fossil vertebrate localities binned across four physiographic regions forming a palaeoequatorial transect. Our results clarify the spatio-temporal expansion of land-living vertebrates, demonstrating that the reduction of tropical wetlands accommodated emerging dryland-adapted amniote faunas from a western Pangaean epicentre. We call this west-east lag the 'Vaughn-Olson model': CPT climatic transitions were regionally diachronous with delayed proliferation of amniote-dominated dryland assemblages in the east. By combining our ecological analyses with a phylogenetic approach, we demonstrate that this pattern also applies to some co-occurring total-group amphibians, suggesting that there was pervasive selection for such dryland adaptations across the crown tetrapod tree, in contrast with stem tetrapods and 'fishes'.

We studied 52 TE insertion polymorphism markers to ascertain their efficiency as a robust DNA marker system for genetic studies in wheat and related species. Significant variation was found in miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) insertions in relation to ploidy with the highest number of "full site" insertions occurring in the hexaploids (32.6 +/- 3.8), while the tetraploid and diploid progenitors had 22.3 +/- 0.6 and 15.0 +/- 3.5 "full sites," respectively, which suggested a recent rapid activation of these transposons after the formation of wheat. Constructed phylogenetic trees were consistent with the evolutionary history of these species which clustered mainly according to ploidy and genome types (SS, AA, DD, AABB, and AABBDD). The synthetic hexaploids sub-clustered near the tetraploid species from which they were re-synthesized. Preliminary genotyping in 104 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) showed predominantly 1:1 segregation for simplex markers, with four of these markers already integrated into our current DArT-and SNP-based linkage map. The MITE insertions also showed stability with no single excision observed. The MITE insertion site polymorphisms uncovered in this study are very promising as high-potential evolutionary markers for genomic studies in wheat.

In drylands, where water resources are more vulnerable to the sediment dynamics, this flaw is even more harmful. In the semi-arid Caatinga biome in the North-east of Brazil, rivers are almost all intermittent and hydro-sedimentological monitoring is scarce. In the biome, water supply derives from thousands of surface reservoirs, whose water availability is liable to be reduced by siltation and sediment-related pollution. The goal of this research was to evaluate the potential of multi-temporal high-resolution satellite imagery (RapidEye) to assess the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the medium-sized intermittent Jaguaribe River, Brazil, during a 5-year period. We validated 15 one-, two- and three-band indices for SSC estimation based on RapidEye spectral bands deduced in the context of the present investigation and nine indices proposed in the literature for other optical sensors, by comparing them with in-situ concentration data. The in-situ SSC data ranged from 67 mg.L-1 to 230 mg.L-1. We concluded that RapidEye images can assess moderate SSC of intermittent rivers, even when their discharge is low. The RapidEye indices performed better than those from literature. The spectral band that best represented SSC was the near infrared, whose performance improved when associated with the green band. This conclusion agrees with literature findings for diverse sedimentological contexts. The three-band spectral indices performed worse than those with only one or two spectral bands, showing that the use of a third band did not enhance the model ability. Besides, we show that the hydrological characteristics of semi-arid intermittent rivers generate difficulties to monitor SSC using optical satellite remote sensing, such as time-concentrated sediment yield; and its association with recent rainfall events and, therefore, with cloudy sky.

Here, we characterized the soil and phyllosphere microbiomes associated with mesquite trees in grazing and urban areas compared to natural areas in the arid Southwestern United States. Our results showed that grazing areas were associated with higher phyllosphere fungal richness, while urban areas had higher phyllosphere richness for both fungi and bacteria/archaea, and additionally, urban soils had lower fungal richness. Specifically, grazing areas were characterized by larger proportions of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil and fungal plant pathogens in the phyllosphere, while urban areas presented higher proportions of fungal plant pathogens in both the soil and phyllosphere as well as nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria in the phyllosphere, but a lower proportion of cellulolytic bacteria in the soil. Furthermore, in urban areas, more phyllosphere microorganisms were sourced from the soil. Collectively, these results suggest that plantassociated microbiomes change significantly across land-use types, and these patterns are different between aboveground and belowground parts of plants, as well as between bacteria/archaea and fungi. These changes in plant-associated microbiomes across land-use types might have important implications for nutrient cycling, plant health, and ecosystem restoration.																			2325-1026					OCT 11	2023	11	1							00026	10.1525/elementa.2023.00026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/elementa.2023.00026													WOS:001121015600001

However, the knowledge of where precipitation-forming water vapor originated is not well understood, limiting the predictability of future precipitation provided climate change. The objective of this study was to characterize the hydrogen (delta D) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotopes and hydro-chemical compositions of precipitation as well as decipher atmospheric water vapor sources in a typical Eurasian steppe river basin. In this regard, this study collected 59 water samples from 44 storm events in 2019 and 2020. The samples were analyzed in our laboratory for ions, delta D, and delta O-18, which in turn were used to examine the stable isotopic features, hydro-chemical char-acteristics, and water vapor transport at different temporal scales by a backward trajectory model and correlation and redundancy analyses. The results showed negative delta D and delta O-18 during the wet season with a trend of positive deuterium excess, indicating that precipitation effect was significant. In comparison with a linear model of global meteoric water levels, the local meteoric water lines had smaller slopes and intercepts, with a maximum slope in August and a minimum slope in July. In addition, HCO3- and Ca2+ were the primary hydro-chemical ions in precipitation. Ca2+ and Mg2+ were significantly correlated with HCO3- and Na+, indicating that they shared terrestrial and marine sources. NH4+ originated mainly from human activities and chemical reactions, whereas K+ originated primarily from continental and marine processes. Further, the atmospheric water vapor was mainly transported from the northeast, northwest, and southeast directions into the study basin, as affected by the westerly wind circulation, the East Asian summer monsoon, northeast anticyclone circulation, and local evapotranspiration. Moreover, the water vapor was from both onsite and offsite sources: over 40% from Eurasia, 10 to 25% from the Arctic Ocean, and 35 to 45% from the Pacific Ocean.

We tested an alternative approach of using biochar and leguminous cover crops to replace natural summer fallowing of about 75 days in the wheat-maize-wheat cropping systems with a view of studying the effects on legume productivity, soil organic carbon (C), and soil nutrients over the 2-year experiments. Materials and methods The two-factor completely randomized block experimental design consisted of biochar, developed from acacia tree biowaste and applied at 0, 5, and 10 t ha(-1) rate, and leguminous cover crops (cowpea, mungbean, and sesbania) with natural fallow were used to test soil fertility and crop productivity. Treatments were laid out following completely randomized block design and each treatment had three replicates leading to 36 experimental plots in total. Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated to find the relationships between plant and soil variables. Regression analysis was performed to study correlations of total organic C with soil available N, P, and K contents. Results and discussion Results from the 2-year experiment indicated that plant height, pods plant(-1), grains pod(-1), 1000-grain weight, fresh and dry biomass, and grain yield were higher at 10 t ha(-1) biochar rate; however, the nodule density plant(-1) of cowpea and sesbania was the highest at 5 t ha(-1) biochar. Integrating legumes with biochar further conserved and improved soil C which significantly positively correlated with soil fertility indicators. Despite linear positive changes in soil pH and electrical conductivity (EC) with biochar rate, increase was minor and was never significant. We observed significant positive relationships of biochar rate with soil organic C contents and soil N and K contents whereas soil P contents were higher at 5 t ha(-1) biochar rate. However, not always significant difference between 5 and 10 t ha(-1) biochar rates for legume and soil productivity suggested flexibility of choosing the biochar application rate. Conclusions Our study emphasized that adopting integrative biochar-leguminous cover crop fallowing to replace natural summer fallowing could yield beneficial effects in terms of conserving soil organic carbon, sustaining soil fertility, and improving soil quality. In addition to positive supplementary effects on the succeeding crops, this approach also allows at utilizing and recycling on-farm biowaste more efficiently and environment friendly.

Uplands, lowlands, and climate: Taphonomic megabiases and the apparent rise of a xeromorphic, drought-tolerant flora during the Pennsylvanian-Permian transition	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Late Mississippian and Pennsylvanian have been referred to as the Coal Age due to enormous paleotropical peat accumulations (coal beds). Numerous fossil floras have been collected from these coals, and their associated seat-earth paleosols and roof-shales, over more than two centuries, leading to the inference of vast swampy wetlands covering the Pangean tropics during the Pennsylvanian. In contrast, the Permian tropics are characterized as more arid, with sparser and more heterogeneous vegetation than inferred for the Pennsylvanian. In the tropics, the Pennsylvanian to Permian transition has been described as a changeover from a pteridophytedominated "Paleophytic flora", to a seed-plant dominated "Mesophytic flora. This view notwithstanding, floras dominated by xeromorphic seed plants also are well known from the Pennsylvanian tropics. Some authors have characterized these plants as being occupants of uplands, subsequently transported into basinal-lowland, preservational environments. In this model, uplands are well drained, causing areas of drought under otherwise everwet climates. In this paper, we present an alternative interpretation: that the apparent transition in Pennsylvanian-Permian tropical vegetation reflects two types of taphonomic megabias. First is a preservational megabias, strongly favoring the vegetation of humid climates over that of seasonally dry climates. Accordingly, tropical-plant preservational potential fluctuated in concert with Late Paleozoic Ice Age glacial-interglacial oscillations, and contemporaneous sea-level and climatic changes. Second is an analytical megabias, strongly favoring the discovery and collection of the wetland biome from Pennsylvanian strata, overlooking the less frequently and more poorly preserved drought-tolerant biome. By Permian times, vast wetlands, and their fossil record, had largely disappeared from central Pangea (although continuing in Cathaysia), making drought-tolerant vegetation more "visible" to searchers, without changing its preservational circumstances. We demonstrate that the upland model is untenable, being inconsistent with the principles of plant biogeography and with geological aspects of the fossil record.

J	Elliott, DR; Thomas, AD; Strong, CL; Bullard, J				Elliott, David R.; Thomas, Andrew D.; Strong, Craig L.; Bullard, Joanna			Surface Stability in Drylands Is Influenced by Dispersal Strategy of Soil Bacteria	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Microbial adaptations for survival and dispersal may directly influence landscape stability and potential for dust emission in drylands where biological soil crusts (biocrusts) protect mineral soil surfaces from wind erosion. In the Lake Eyre basin of central Australia we operated a wind tunnel on sandy soils and collected the liberated material, which was subjected to DNA sequencing to identify the microbial community composition. Microbial composition of entrained dust was compared with that of the source sand dune soil in addition to nearby claypan and nebkha soils and water channels that together form a recycling sediment transport system. Wind was found to preferentially liberate 359 identified taxa from sand dunes, whereas 137 identified taxa were found to resist wind erosion. Water channel communities included many taxa in common with the soil samples. We hypothesize that the ease with which soil microbes become airborne is often linked to whether the organism is adapted for dispersal by wind or vegetative growth and that biocrust organisms found in water channels may sometimes use a fluvial dispersal strategy, which exploits rare flooding events to rapidly colonize vast pans that are common in drylands. We explain likely geomorphic implications of microbial dispersal strategies which are a consequence of organisms engineering the environment to provide their particular needs. By identifying microbes fitting expectations for these dispersal strategies based on differential abundance analyses, we provide a new perspective for understanding the role of microbiota in landscape stability.

ACTA SCIENTIARUM-AGRONOMY												An enhanced level of drought tolerance in wheat (Triticum spp.) may be reached through combining agronomic and physiological traits associated with grain yield under drought conditions. We aimed to explore valuable diversity for the drought tolerance, existed in the core collection of Iranian spring bread wheat landraces. A number of 206 spring bread wheat accessions along with the check cultivar were assessed for grain yield, drought-adaptive traits, and estimated drought tolerance criteria during 2016-17 and 2017-18 growing seasons. Analysis of data using the best linear unbiased predictions (BLUPs) approach revealed that the genotype x environment (GE) interactions accounted for the highest variation in grain yield (36.23%) followed by 1000-kernel weight (35.39%), heading date (21.4%), days to maturity (16.38%), and plant height (5.83%). Using the hierarchical cluster analysis and developed pattern heat map based on the values for the agronomic traits and drought resistance indices, the accessions clustered into nine groups of different sets of agronomic and drought tolerance characteristics. Several accessions with high yield potential, early heading, optimal plant stature and high drought tolerance groups were identified. Three drought selection criteria of stress tolerance index (STI), geometric mean productivity (GMP) and mean productivity (MP) were more effective in identifying accessions producing higher yield under both drought and irrigated conditions. The superior accessions identified in this study may be explored further for breeding new wheat cultivars with enhanced level of drought tolerance.

A spatiotemporal framework reveals contrasting factors shape biocrust microbial and microfaunal communities in the Chihuahuan Desert	GEODERMA												Biocrusts are soil-surface communities composed of autotrophic and heterotrophic microbiota that affect nutrient cycling, plant performance, soil hydrology and stability within drylands. Biocrust community composition is mostly thought to be driven by abiotic factors, but the structure of the bacteria, fungi, protist, and microfauna taxa are rarely documented simultaneously or over time. In this study, we examined the composition, abundance, and diversity of microbes (bacteria and fungi) and microfauna (protists and microscopic microfauna) in three types of biocrusts among two different vegetative habitats in the northern Chihuahuan Desert during three successive seasons. Microbial groups were identified by phospholipid fatty acid analyses (PLEA) and included actinobacteria, gram-positive bacteria, rhizobia, gram-negative bacteria, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and saprophytic fungi. Microfauna were enumerated via microscopy and included nematodes, tardigrades, rotifers, amoebae, ciliates, and flagellates. We found that microbial communities were most affected by biocrust type, whereas microfaunal communities were more influenced by sampling season. Season was also associated with different indicator taxa. Additionally, microbial communities were related to biocrust chemical properties, which changed with season and surrounding vegetation while microfaunal communities were not. In cyanolichen-dominated crusts, but not others, the structure of microbial and microfaunal communities were strongly correlated. Our study highlights possible food web interactions and provides evidence that the co-occurring microbial and microfaunal taxa associated with biocrusts are temporally dynamic and structured by different drivers.

In this study, climate change impacts on irrigated grain corn, grain sorghum, winter wheat, and dryland (rainfed) winter wheat in the Palo Duro watershed of the Texas High Plains were assessed using an improved Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model with an enhanced irrigation representation of management allowed depletion (MAD) irrigation scheduling. Climate change analyses in this study used the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate projections of 11 General Circulation Models (GCMs) under four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) emission scenarios of RCP2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 during two 30-year periods of the middle (2040-2069) and end (2070-2099) of the 21st century to compare to a baseline period of 1970-1999. For the irrigated summer crops of corn and sorghum, all 11 GCMs predicted the reductions of future irrigation, crop evapotranspiration (ETc), and yields compared to the baseline period. According to an ensemble of 11 GCMs, the simulated reductions in average annual irrigation, ETc, and yield for the irrigated corn were 63%, 34%, and 13%, respectively, at the end of the 21st century under the severe emission scenario of RCP8.5. Those values were 80%, 34%, and 34% under the irrigated sorghum land use. As for the irrigated winter wheat, the decreases in future irrigation and ETc were also identified in all GCMs relative to the baseline period. However, irrigated wheat yields were increased in the future climate. The changes in dryland wheat ETc were consistent with the rainfall variation under all climate change scenarios. Generally, the future climate could benefit the dryland wheat yields. A large uncertainty was found for the surface runoff simulations under both irrigated and dryland wheat according to various GCMs.						Porter, Dana/0000-0001-9573-3423													0168-1923	1873-2240				NOV 15	2021	310								108649	10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108649	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108649		SEP 2021											WOS:000698753900025
J	Wang, HB; Li, X; Xiao, JF; Ma, MG				Wang, Haibo; Li, Xin; Xiao, Jingfeng; Ma, Mingguo			Evapotranspiration components and water use efficiency from desert to alpine ecosystems in drylands	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Water use efficiency (WUE), the ratio of carbon gain to water loss, is an important physiological indicator in assessing the interactions between the carbon and water cycles. Quantifying the spatiotemporal patterns of WUE at both canopy and ecosystem levels across main dryland ecosystems along climate gradients is vital for water resource management in water-limited regions. However, the patterns of WUE among natural and managed ecosystems in drylands are not well understood. We partitioned the evapotranspiration (ET) components and calculated WUE at both canopy and ecosystem levels across dryland ecosystems in an arid region in Northwest China using observations from a regional flux observation network. Our results showed divergent variations of canopy and ecosystem WUE across the main ecosystems along climate gradients in arid regions. The ecosystem WUE and canopy WUE ranged from 0.7 to 1.8 gC Kg(-1) H2O and from 0.8 to 2.4 gC Kg(-1) H2O, respectively. Climatic gradients were the dominant factors controlling the spatial patterns of WUE across dryland ecosystems. Divergences were also observed between oasis and natural ecosystems because of different environmental conditions and management practices. Climatic regulation of the spatial WUE patterns was dominated by water variability rather than temperature. The higher canopy WUE for desert ecosystems indicated that these ecosystems were adapted to the water-limited environment. The discrepancies of both canopy and ecosystem WUE between croplands in arid and hyper-arid climate zones were caused by the differences in agricultural management techniques for these crops. Human activities (e.g., irrigation and agriculture management) altered the distribution of water resource and water use strategies, which further affected the magnitude and patterns of WUE in drylands. This study provides insights into the spatiotemporal patterns of ET components and both canopy and ecosystem WUE over dryland ecosystems and can inform regional water resources management in water-limited regions.					li, xin/HHS-9461-2022; Li, Xin/F-7473-2011; Wang, Haibo/AAH-3749-2020; Mingguo, Ma/A-8087-2013	Li, Xin/0000-0003-2999-9818; Wang, Haibo/0000-0002-1233-4484; 													0168-1923	1873-2240				MAR 15	2021	298								108283	10.1016/j.agrformet.2020.108283	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2020.108283													WOS:000610797100007

However, in areas such as densely vegetated and irrigated regions, obtaining accurate SSM remains challenging. Before using satellite and model-based SSM estimates over these areas, we should understand the accuracy and error characteristics of various SSM products. Thus, this study aimed to compare the error characteristics of global-scale SSM over vegetated and irrigated areas as obtained from active and passive satellites and model-based data: Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 (ERA5), and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). We employed triple collocation analysis (TCA) and caluclated conventional error metrics from in-situ SSM measurements. We also considered all possible triplets from 6 different products and showed the viability of considering the standard deviation of TCA-based numbers in producing robust results. Over forested areas, it was expected that model-based SSM data might provide more accurate SSM estimates than satellites due to the intrinsic limitations of microwave-based systems. Alternately, over irrigated regions, observation-based SSM data were expected to be more accurate than model-based products because land surface models (LSMs) cannot capture irrigation signals caused by human activities. Contrary to these expectations, satellite-based SSM estimates from ASCAT, SMAP, and SMOS showed fewer errors than ERA5 and GLDAS SSM products over vegetated conditions. Furthermore, over irrigated areas, ASCAT, SMOS, and SMAP outperformed other SSM products; however, model-based data from ERA5 and GLDAS outperformed AMSR2. Our results emphasize that, over irrgated areas, considering satellite-based SSM data as alternatives to model-based SSM data sometimes produces misleading results; and considering model-based data as alternatives to satellite-based SSM data in forested areas can also sometimes be misleading. In addition, we discovered that no products showed much degradation in TCA-based errors under different vegetated conditions, while different irrigation conditions impacted both satellite and model-based SSM data sets. The present research demonstrates that limitations in satellite and modeled SSM data can be overcome in many areas through the synergistic use of satellite and model-based SSM products, excluding areas where satellite-based data are masked out. In fact, when four satellite and model data sets are used selectively, the probability of obtaining SSM with stronger signal than noise can be close to 100%.

Soil water and crop water use with crop rotations and cultural practices	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Limited and erratic precipitation in arid and semiarid regions can affect soil water storage, water use, and dryland crop performance. Our objective was to examine soil water content, crop yield, and water-use efficiency (WUE) with crop rotations and cultural practices for 6 yr in the northern Great Plains. Crop rotations were durum wheat (or durum) (Triticum turgidum L.)-durum-canola (Brassica napus L.)-pea (Pisum sativum L.) (DDCP), durum-durum-flax (Linum usitatissimum L.)-pea (DDFP), durum-canola-durum-pea (DCDP), and durum-flax-durum-pea (DFDP). A continuous durum (CD) was also included for comparison. Cultural practices were traditional (a combination of conventional tillage, recommended seeding rate, broadcast N fertilization, and reduced stubble height) and improved (a combination of no-tillage, increased seeding rate, banded N fertilization, and increased stubble height) practices. Pre-plant and postharvest soil water contents at the 0- to 122-cm depth were 19-39 mm lower with DDFP than other crop rotations. Pre-plant soil water was 21-39 mm greater in the improved than the traditional cultural practice in 3 out of 6 yr. Annualized grain yield was 207-370 kg ha(-1) lower with DDFP than CD and DCDP. Overall water use and WUE (yield/water use) for the rotation system were not affected by treatments, but varied for each crop as the growing season precipitation (GSP) increased. Pre-plant and postharvest soil water, water use, grain yield, and WUE for each crop in the rotation varied with treatments and years. Alternate-year rotations and CD can enhance dryland soil water storage and crop yield compared to stacked rotations.

Pervasive impacts of climate change on the woodiness and ecological generalism of dry forest plant assemblages	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Climate emergency is a significant threat to biodiversity in the 21st century, but species will not be equally affected. In summing up the responses of different species at the local scale, we can assess changes in the species quantity and composition of biotic assemblages. We used more than 420K curated occurrence records of 3060 plant species to model current and future patterns of plant species distribution in one of the world's largest tropical dry forests-the Caatinga. While allowing different model extrapolation scenarios, we estimated potential changes in the species richness and composition of dryland plant assemblages in response to projected climate change, and assessed how the ecological generalism and woodiness of plant assemblages can be impacted by the climate crisis. More than 99% of plant assemblages were projected to lose species by 2060, with biotic homogenisation-the decrease in spatial beta diversity-forecasted in 40% of the Caatinga. The replacement of narrow-range woody species by wide-range non-woody ones should impact at least 90% of Caatinga plant assemblages. The exacerbated species loss in the dryland plant assemblages was connected to the heterogenisation and homogenisation of biotic assemblages. Still, the magnitude of climate change impacts on ecological generalism and woodiness patterns of dryland plant assemblages differ according to the direction of the biotic change process. Synthesis. The future increase in aridity will change the patterns of woodiness and ecological generalism of tropical dry forest plant assemblages by decreasing vegetation diversity and complexity. The projected biotic changes in dryland plant assemblages indicate the erosion of ecosystem services linked to biomass productivity and carbon storage. We highlight the importance of long-term conservation planning for maintaining tropical dry forests.

J	Adams, C; Thapa, S; Kimura, E				Adams, Curtis; Thapa, Santanu; Kimura, Emi			Determination of a plant population density threshold for optimizing cotton lint yield: A synthesis	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Technology fees associated with modern cotton cultivars have increased seed costs considerably, giving producers the impetus to reduce plant population density, where possible. Most recent studies on cotton population density, conducted across diverse environments, report similar patterns of crop response: decreases in lint yield only at very low densities, with generally consistent yield across all higher densities. But no work had been done to bring the literature together, quantitively synthesizing the yield data collectively, to better pinpoint a population density threshold. And, notably, little had been reported on the effects of population density in lower yielding dryland environments. Quantitatively synthesizing population density datasets from the literature, including our own dryland data, was the objective of this research. The dryland data showed that lint yield and biomass partitioning were not affected by population density, similar to higher-yielding environments over the same range in density. Following normalization of all lint yield data (literature and dryland datasets), a breakpoint in population density at 35,000 plants ha(-1) was identified, which can be interpreted as the minimum plant density at which yield may be optimized. This rate is lower than the common density recommendation of 81,000 plants ha(-1) and substantially lower than the risk-averse rates at which many producers plant (129,000 seeds ha(-1) or greater). The analysis showed that yield will decline precipitously below 35,000 plants ha(-1), exposing the enormous risk to cotton producers in approaching this low density, particularly if significant seed or plant loss is expected. However, the analysis suggests that excessive over-seeding may be occurring in many cases, resulting in economic losses to producers. The analysis also provides guidance on a threshold for producers facing replanting decisions.

We aimed to analyze the dynamics in the lag time (T-L) of peak flow for a tropical watershed (Kecha) and its sub-watersheds (Dokmit, Zenjero Maderia, and Wotit Minch) in Ethiopia, as influenced by land-use changes from 1982 to 2017 and the implementation of soil and water conservation (SWC) practices since 2011. Layered maps of land use, soil type, and SWC practices were used to determine the curve number, and the Natural Resource Conservation Service hydrologic model was used to estimate T-L. We compared the estimated values against measured median values of T-L for 30 rainfall-runoff events. The estimated T-L of 1982, 2005, and 2017 varied from 9 to 19 min, 8 to 18 min, and 10 to 22 min, respectively, in the Dokmit, Zenjero Maderia, and Wotit Minch sub-watersheds. The smallest (8 min) and greatest (22 min) values of T-L were observed during 2005 and 2017, respectively. These results are likely attributable to the increased amount of cultivated area at the expense of bushland and forest in 2005 as compared to 1982, and the implementation of SWC practices in 2011-2017. Dokmit had the lowest T-L values of the three sub-watersheds, most likely because of its greater coverage of grazing and cultivated lands and degraded Nitic Luvisol. The variation in T-L values among the sub-watersheds was related to changes in both land use and SWC practices but also to the presence of degraded areas inherited from past human activities. Overall, such spatiotemporal flow response time analysis can provide useful information for the proper design of sustainable development strategies for particular niches in tropical regions of Ethiopia and elsewhere.

Identifying causes of low persistence of perennial ryegrass (<i>Lolium perenne</i>) dairy pasture using the Basic Grassland model (BASGRA)	GRASS AND FORAGE SCIENCE												Recent years have seen a decline in herbage production and tiller populations in New Zealand's perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) dairy pastures. One hypothesis is that modern genotypes are less suited to the warmer, drier weather experienced under changing climate patterns. In this study, a combination of long-term trial data (2011-2017) and a process-based pasture model (BASGRA) was used to explore the causes and possible mitigation of the observed production and population loss at three sites (dryland sites in Northland and Waikato and an irrigated site in Canterbury). Bayesian calibration was used to identify the model parameter sets that were consistent with the trial data and to identify differences in plant morphology and responses between sites. The model successfully simulated the observed differences in tiller numbers between the dryland sites, where populations and production declined rapidly after the second year and the irrigated site where populations and production were maintained. Analysis of the model calibrations along with preliminary scenario simulations suggests that increased tiller mortality associated with drought was the main cause of persistence failure at the dryland sites and that decreasing grazing pressure or breeding for tolerance to higher temperatures may not be successful in preventing this.

We studied the 9-yr effect of no mulching (CK), straw mulching (SM), and plastic film mulching (PM) on soil bacterial and fungal community structure and their relationships to soil C and N fractions under dryland winter wheat in the Loess Plateau of China. The SM did not affect bacterial diversity and richness, but enhanced fungal diversity and richness compared to CK in subsoil layers. The PM also increased fungal diversity and richness, but reduced bacterial diversity and richness compared to SM and CK. Compared to CK, the relative abundance of Actinobacteria was lower with SM at 0-10 cm, but the abundances of Nitrospirae, Firmicutes, WS3, and Zygomycota were greater with PM at most soil depths. Bacterial diversity correlated with soil C and N fractions, and fungal richness with potential N mineralization and microbial biomass C and N. Although plastic film mulching enhanced fungal diversity and richness compared to no mulching, straw mulching was more effective in maintaining soil microbial diversity and richness and enhancing soil C and N fractions under dryland winter wheat.

Spatial economic predictions of managed aquifer recharge for an agricultural landscape	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Groundwater banking through managed aquifer recharge (MAR) can augment the irrigation water supply with less social and environmental opposition than dams. Our high spatial resolution hydro-economic model investigates the influence of site conditions such as natural recharge, proximity to surface water sources, and the agronomic conditions of crops on four model outcomes: optimal MAR, final groundwater level, present value of farm net returns, and the cost-effectiveness of a MAR subsidy. We find that less irrigation intensive crops are a substitute for MAR while rice and dryland crops are a complement for MAR. Optimal MAR is larger at a site with greater net returns to rice and dryland soybeans, lower net returns to irrigated corn and soybeans, and lower natural recharge. MAR increases groundwater conservation most at the sites with higher net returns to dryland and irrigated soybeans and lower net returns to corn and cotton. MAR raises the present value of economic returns from agriculture more where the net returns from rice are large, but the cost-effective locations for a MAR subsidy are sites with large net returns to crops like cotton and soybeans. Higher natural recharge at a site correlates with a lower present value of economic returns from MAR and a less cost-effective MAR subsidy.

L.			Quantifying the drivers of ecosystem fluxes and water potential across the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum in an arid woodland	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Dryland ecosystems occupy a vast swath of the terrestrial land surface and exert a sizeable impact on the cycling of carbon and water globally. These biomes are characterized by tightly coupled carbon and water cycles that respond rapidly to transient pulses in water availability. However, there exist many mechanistic uncertainties regarding the environmental drivers of, and linkages between, plant and ecosystem processes. Thus, drylands are often poorly represented in many vegetation and land surface models. An enhanced understanding of dryland ecosystem function is limited by the lack of long-term, co-located, and frequent measurements of plant and ecosystem processes. At a pinon-juniper woodland in southeastern Utah, USA, we collected a continuous dataset of meteorological conditions, soil water potential from surface to bedrock, tree water potential, and ecosystem carbon and water fluxes from eddy covariance. We found that predawn and midday tree water potential and daily ecosystem fluxes were highly sensitive to fluctuations in soil water availability, particularly in shallower layers, and that daytime variability in atmospheric drivers only loosely controlled these processes. The strong connections between shallow soil water potential, tree water potential, and ecosystem fluxes occurred because of the dominant role of precipitation pulses in driving vegetation activity, as even small pulses of moisture stimulated shallow soil water potential, tree water potential, and evapotranspiration for between 1 and 2 weeks. Carbon fluxes (net ecosystem exchange and gross primary productivity) were sensitive to precipitation pulses for longer, up to 3 weeks. Our results highlight that improved monitoring and sensing of shallow soil moisture can greatly enhance our understanding of dryland ecosystem function. A better mechanistic understanding of the impacts of precipitation pulses is also needed to improve vegetation modeling of dryland ecosystems.

Therefore, the moisture history of the forest areas reconstructed by tree rings may differ from that of the dryland areas. In the extremely arid area of the western Qilian Mountains and the surrounding dryland areas, where forest is absent, it is unclear how humidity conditions have changed over the past several centuries. Here, we use a pollen record from Tian'E Lake, with a chronology based on(210)Pb and(137)Cs, and with an average temporal resolution of similar to 2 years, to reconstruct the humidity changes over the past 300 years. The results show that the pollen assemblage is dominated byArtemisiaand Amaranthaceae (=Chenopodiaceae), and therefore, the A/C (Artemisia/Chenopodiaceae) ratio can be used to reconstruct changes in humidity conditions. Based on the pollen A/C ratio, two relatively wet periods are identified: similar to 1740-1750 and 1840-1980, and two dry intervals: similar to 1750-1840 and 1980-2018. This pattern of variation is similar to that reconstructed from nearby humidity records based on tree-ring width adjacent to the Tian'E Lake area and with instrumental records from meteorological stations over the past several decades. However, there are significantly different records between pollen-based and tree-ring based humidity during similar to 1760-1830, 1880-1910, and 1920-2018 in the Qilian Mountains on long timescales. We conclude that pollen-based humidity records from dryland areas may differ from those reconstructed from tree-ring widths in forested mountain areas, especially when the temperature was increasing. It was further suggested that there was an antiphased relationship in humidity conditions between westerlies-dominated central Asia and monsoon areas over the past century.

J	Saini, D; Bhardwaj, P; Singh, O				Saini, Divya; Bhardwaj, Pankaj; Singh, Omvir			Recent rainfall variability over Rajasthan, India	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												In this study, an attempt has been made to examine the recent rainfall variability by means of daily rainfall data of 33 well-spread stations over dryland ecosystem of Rajasthan in north western India during 1961-2017. For trend analysis, Mann-Kendall, Sen's slope estimator, and simple linear regression test have been used (at 95% confidence level). The results have shown a high interannual variability in rainfall occurrence varying from 277 mm (in year 2002) to 839 mm (in year 1975) with mean of 583 mm over this dryland ecosystem. Most of the rainfall deficit years have occurred with El-Nino years. The mean annual rainfall has shown a marginal non-significant upward trend over the ecosystem. The station-wise mean annual rainfall has revealed a significant rising trend over Barmer, Churu, Ganganagar, Jaisalmer, and Pratapgarh stations. Interestingly, 3-year running average has shown a cyclic pattern of rainfall over dryland ecosystem under the changing climatic conditions. The spatial pattern has exhibited that the mean annual rainfall decreases from east and south east (more than 850 mm) to west and north west (less than 400 mm), which is mainly associated with the presence of Aravalli Mountains spreading north east to south west in central Rajasthan. Remarkably, majority of stations positioned in western parts of dryland ecosystem have shown increasing rainfall trends, whereas some stations located in eastern parts have recorded a non-significant declining trend. The magnitude of significant rising trend has varied from 5.34 mm/year (Pratapgarh station) to 2.17 mm/year (Jaisalmer station). Also, the frequency of heavy rainfall events has shown a positive trend with significant increasing trends over Bharatpur, Jaisalmer, and Pratapgarh stations, whereas Bundi station has shown significant decreasing trend.

This study determines the amount of between-cultivar variation, in cultivars available to farmers, in annual dry matter production and seasonality of that dry matter production when grown in dryland grazing areas of south east Australia. Forty-seven cultivars of lucerne, that spanned the range of winter activity ratings, were defoliated every 6 weeks for a period of nearly four years at two contrasting dryland sites. At each site, annual and seasonal dry matter growth was measured over three yearly periods. The variation between cultivars was examined using models with random between-cultivar effects. At both sites and in most years, within the Australian commercial cultivars, the higher (97.5% quantile) annual growth cultivars had about 20-30% greater annual growth than the lower (2.5% quantile) annual growth cultivars. Whilst variation between cultivars in seasonality of growth was statistically detectable, the main feature was the small magnitude of this between cultivar variation. We suggest that dryland farmers in temperate regions (similar to south-east Australia) should make purchasing decisions of lucerne cultivar based on annual production, pest and disease resistance, persistence and grazing tolerance, and mostly ignore differences in seasonality of production.

LINKING SEDIMENT FLUX TO RIVER MIGRATION IN ARID LANDSCAPES THROUGH MASS BALANCE	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												Lateral migration is a key process shaping sinuous rivers and controlling sediment exchange with floodplains. The rate at which channels migrate is affected by bend curvature, bank erodibility, and sediment supply. The relationship between migration rate and sediment supply is poorly understood in dryland regions, where direct measurements arc scarce. Here we propose a simple mass-balance model to estimate the sediment flux of ephemeral streams in North America's Great Basin and establish a comparison with timelapse photogrammetric data of lateral migration. The model takes into consideration variables such as long-term hillslope erosion, transient sediment storage in intra-catchment lowlands, and sediment bypass to depocenters. Our results point to first-order similarities in how sediment supply drives channel migration across diverse hydro-climatic regimes. however, we find that, for a given sediment supply and channel width, and despite their ephemeral discharge, dryland streams with minimal bank vegetation migrate about three times faster than humid-climate, vegetated ones. This difference in migration pace likely results from the compound effect of bank erodibility and bend geometry. Our model sheds new light on the driving mechanisms of channel mobility in dryland streams and may find application in assessing the sediment budgets of ungauged streams, reservoir trapping, and morphodynamic adjustments in stressed watersheds.

However, the effects of climate change and rising CO2 levels on the terrestrial carbon stock of the arid region of China remain unclear. In this study, we used three climate reanalysis datasets to drive an arid ecosystem model (AEM), which we used to assess uncertainties in spatial climate datasets. All simulations suggest that the arid region of China acted as a carbon sink (0.20-0.34 Pg C) from 1980 to 2014. However, we found large uncertainties in the spatial pattern of carbon stocks during this period, especially in northern Xinjiang and western Inner Mongolia. These uncertainties are related to changes in precipitation. To reduce the uncertainty of carbon stock assessment results in the arid region of China, efforts should be implemented to improve the reliability of climate data in northern Xinjiang and western Inner Mongolia. Specifically, China's policy makers should pay close attention to climate change and ecosystem health in southwestern Xinjiang. According to our study, this area experienced significant decreases in precipitation and increases in temperature from 1980 to 2014. The severe ecosystem degradation that occurred will very likely continue into the future. In addition, the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) dataset may overestimate ecosystem carbon sinks as this dataset overestimates the increase in precipitation in the arid region of China. Therefore, it is advisable to be cautious when using the CFSR dataset in ecological studies in northern Eurasian dryland areas. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Drivers of diazotroph community structure and co-occurrence in a Northern Great Plains pulse crop rotation system	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												The Northern Great Plains of the United States and Canada have seen an increase in pulse crops like pea, lentil, and chickpea acreage in dryland and irrigated systems. Rotating pulse crops into cereal crop production systems could reduce the demand for nitrogen fertilizer due to the symbiotic relationship with nitrogen fixing bacteria called diazotrophs. Legume-diazotroph relationships are well studied, but little is known about the free-living bacteria of the bulk soil in the legume-cereal rotation systems. Here we determine the community structure of the overall (16S) and diazotroph (nifH) soil microbiome in pulse-cereal rotations across the state of Montana. Many variables influenced the microbial community structure, but and among them, irrigation caused a significant shift in the composition of the communities and co-occurrence network topology. Interestingly, the diazotrophic communities in dryland soil are more robust and contain more generalist compared to irrigated soils. Co-occurrence networks support the identification of different diazotrophic keystone taxa such as Firmicutes in irrigated and Proteobacteria in dryland soils. Linking farm management practices and crop productivity with microbial community structure dynamics is an initial step in establishing a knowledge base for farmers to exploit the soil microbiota to maintain healthy soil for crop production.

Nitrogen utilization efficiency is the ratio of retained nitrogen in body tissue to the total nitrogen intake, which is the main factor in the body weight gain of ruminants, and usually range from 15% to 40%. The methane emissions of ruminants are an inevitable by-product when feeds have been fermented in the rumen and represents a 2% to 12% loss of diet energy. The low nitrogen utilization of ruminants can damage air quality and lead to soil nitrification and acidification, whereas high methane emissions from ruminants can increase global warming. Our study investigated the effects of two kinds of legumes (alfalfa and common vetch) with different levels (20% vs. 40%) of total dry matter allowance on body weight gain, nutrient digestibility, nitrogen utilization efficiency, and enteric methane emissions for crossbred Simmental cattle. Our results suggested that nitrogen utilization efficiency and methane emissions are significantly affected by the legume species and proportions. These results could be beneficial for the development of regional or national ruminant feeding systems, thereby improving nitrogen utilization efficiency and reducing methane emissions. Abstract: A low nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE, the ratio of retained N to N intake) and high methane (CH4) emissions of ruminants can lead to potentially high diet protein wastage and directly contribute to global warming. Diet manipulation is the most effective way to improve NUE or reduce CH4 emissions. This study investigated how replacing oat hay with alfalfa hay (AH) or common vetch hay (CVH) with different proportions (20% (20) and 40% (40) of the total dry matter (DM) allowance) affects the body weight gain (BWG), NUE, and CH4 emissions of crossbred Simmental cattle. The forage dry matter intake (DMI) and the total DMI of cattle fed on a CVH40 diet were significantly higher than the values for those fed on AH20 or AH40 diets (p < 0.05). There were no differences in the BWG for the four treatments observed, however, nutrient digestibility significantly decreased in the AH40 diet as compared with the AH20 diet (p < 0.05). The NUE was significantly lower in AH40 than in CVH20. The CH4 emissions were significantly lower for the CVH40 diet than with the AH20 diet (p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that a 20% AH and 40% CVH substitution for oat hay are the optimal proportions to maintain the BWG, NUE, nutrient digestibility, and reduce the CH4 emissions of crossbred Simmental cattle. Overall, CVH has a greater potential to reduce CH4 emissions than AH.

Roberty] is a multi-purpose crop that has an untapped potential for biofuel production. We conducted a field study at Temple, TX, to determine plant growth characteristics that make vetivergrass an ideal candidate bioenergy feedstock crop. Overall, the high biomass yield (avg. 18.4 +/- 0.7 Mg ha(-1)) can be attributed to the high leaf area index (LAI, avg. 12.7 +/- 2.5) and crop growth rates that ranged from 2.7 +/- 0.1 to 15.7 +/- 0.1 g m(-2) d(-1). Plant tissue N and P concentrations ranged from 0.59-1.66% and 0.06-0.15%, respectively. Surprisingly, the radiation use efficiency (RUE, avg. 2.2 +/- 0.1 g MJ(-1)) was not high relative to other highly productive grasses. Biomass yield was highly correlated to plant height (avg. 2.1 +/- 0.1 m) and LAI (Pearson, r = 0.96 and 0.77, respectively). Data from the field experiment provided plant coefficients that were used to develop an Agricultural Land Management Alternatives with Numerical Assessment Criteria (ALMANAC) vetivergrass model to assess dryland and irrigated interannual and spatial biomass yields across Texas. ALMANAC simulated dryland and irrigated yields ranged from 0.8-39.3 (avg. 17.2) Mg ha(-1) and 9.1-47.0 (avg. 25.4) Mg ha(-1), respectively. There was huge spatial variation in dryland and irrigated yields, with CV values of 20 and 15%, respectively. Similarly, dryland and irrigated inter-annual yields respectively had CV values of 25 and 17%. State-wide simulation model assessments complement field studies, and furthermore allow bioenergy companies and investors to better estimate biofuel feedstock potential for new crops such as vetivergrass.

Nutritional Quality and Popability of Popcorn (<i>Zea mays</i> L. var. everta) in Response to Compost and NPK 20-7-3 Application under Dryland Condition of South Africa	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE												The dietary value of popcorn, an important snack, depends on its proximate and nutritional constituents, while the economic worth is based on popability and expansion traits of the kernels. There is paucity of information on how soil fertility influences or relates with popping potentials as well as quality of popcorn kernel in semi-arid region. Therefore, the proximate composition and popping parameters of popcorn in response to organic and inorganic fertilizers were investigated. The field trial was conducted in 2017-2019, and it comprised five amendment rates including 90 and 180 kg ha(-1) NPK fertilizer and 4 and 8 t ha(-1) compost and unamended treatment as the control. The trial was arranged in randomized complete block design in triplicate. Data on kernel yield, biomass, and harvest index were evaluated. Kernels were analysed for proximate composition and popping indices using standard procedures. Across the two seasons, mean protein (8.1%) and fibre (10.2%) contents were highest in kernels from plots fertilized with NPK at 180 kg ha(-1), while grains from plots fertilized with 8 t ha(-1) compost had the highest moisture (19.3%) and starch (50.1%) contents. The highest kernel expansion of 54.18 cm(3) g(-1) and 77.6% popped kernels were obtained in plots fertilized with 4 t ha(-1) compost. Most of the kernels (61%) were small-sized caryopsis. Popability is significantly associated with volume expansion (r=0.696). Proximate components and popability improved greatly in compost-augmented field relative to the unfertilized plots. Application of 4 or 8 t ha(-1) sorted municipal solid waste compost to Luvisol enhanced growth and nutritional quality of popcorn. In view of promoting nutrient cycling towards improving soil fertility without compromising environmental health, compost is comparable and a good alternative to fossil-based mineral fertilizers.					; Kutu, Funso Raphael/GRS-9988-2022	Dada, Oyeyemi/0000-0003-0304-5442; Kutu, Funso Raphael/0000-0002-8162-0329; Mavengahama, Sydney/0000-0002-3479-2646													2356-7015	2314-5765				JUN 15	2023	2023								6115098	10.1155/2023/6115098	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2023/6115098								37360226					WOS:001017475400001

In recent decades, continuous development of apple orchards in the southern Chinese Loess Plateau has formed the orchard-cropland mosaic vegetation pattern. In this study, soil water content (SWC) in two series were measured, (1) 0-21 m soil profiles of five apple orchards with different stand ages (5, 10, 15, 20 and 24 years) and one cropland; (2) 0-6 m soil profiles at different sites within the orchard-cropland border zone (with apple orchard aged 10 and 24 years old, denoted as AC10 and AC24, respectively). Results showed that (1) the water consumption depth of apple orchards increased in an "S"-shaped pattern with stand age and reached 20 m after 20 years, while the average SWC within 3-21 m layer decreased and the soil water deficits increased at a rate of 5.8 mm m  1 yr  1; and (2) the average SWC in 3-10 m layer of 15, 20 and 24-year-old orchards accounted for 69.3%, 64.2% and 57.9% of the field capacity, respectively, these proportions came to 71.2%, 67.4% and 61.1% in the 3-21 m layer, respectively; and (3) AC24 had greater influence on SWC of adjacent cropland than AC10. The soil water storage of 2-6 m layer in AC24 ranged from 713 mm to 879 mm within 7 m away from the orchard, which were significantly lower than those of 7-15 m away from the orchard (933-1042 mm). Overall, the apple tree root system can absorb soil water from a depth of 20 m in the vertical direction and up to 7 m from the adjacent cropland in the horizontal direction. Therefore, a reasonable orchardcropland mosaic pattern should be arranged in regional agricultural planning, so as to promote the optimized utilization of regional soil water resources, and to coordinate the development of fruit industry and food security, in which the width of a cropland can't be < 14 m.

The smallholders grow crops for domestic and off-farm markets, necessitating crop variety attributes for which trait mismatches may limit adoption. Indeed, improved variety adoption is varied and limited, especially for self-pollinated crops, in part due to the mismatch in characteristics of commercialised varieties. The international research community leads breeding of varieties for under-invested crops, especially legumes. These varieties are often resilient and productive, but the dynamisms in target agri-food systems may limit their relevance. Gaining a better understanding of the trait profiles that crop value chain actors consider will increase their adoption. This study combined multi-location trials and participatory variety selection (PVS) of pigeon pea and groundnut across different environments to evaluate the efficacy of both processes in the breeding of desired varieties. The present study shows improvement in the new materials regarding performance and preference by farmers. Additionally, PVS showed that men prioritised productivity and market-enhancing traits, whereas women ranked food security traits highest.																			0179-9541	1439-0523				2023 AUG 29	2023										10.1111/pbr.13140	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbr.13140		AUG 2023											WOS:001063849200001

Biological interpretation of genotype x environment interaction in rainfed durum wheat	CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS												Climate variability and associated droughts are major environmental factors limiting crop productivity worldwide. Identification and better understanding of factors influencing genotype x environment (GE) interaction in drought-prone environments will allow breeders and producers to improve crop productivity. The objectives of this study were to identify genotypic and climatic factors responsible for GE interactions in durum wheat yield trials under highland cold and moderate cold rainfed areas of Iran. Field experiments were carried out using 20 durum wheat genotypes, differing in growth habit, in three highland rainfed research stations for three cropping seasons (2015-2018). Environments were characterized by climatic co-variables measured during the three seasons. Genotypes were described by co-variables related to phenology, agronomy and disease resistance. Possible factors influencing GE interaction were examined by factorial regression (FR), partial least squares (PLS) regression and the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) models. The results indicated that both AMMI IPCA1 and IPCA2 scores had positive and negative values, resulting in crossover GE interaction and leading to inconsistent yield performance of genotypes across environments. The AMMI, PLS and FR identified similar genotypic and climatic variables that explained a large proportion of the GE interaction for grain yield. Based on the results, the climatic variables of average temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, minimum and maximum temperature, and genotypic variables of heading date, plant height and 1000-kernel weight were among the most important factors responsible for differential genotype adaptation. The PLS biplot showed that the genotypic responses to environmental covariates depended strongly on the growth habit type. This information can contribute toward the identification and biological understanding of adaptive characteristics relevant for durum wheat breeding in highland cold rainfed conditions of Iran and facilitate cultivar recommendation at eco-regional level. In conclusion, the AMMI, PLS and FR complement each other and the PLS biplot offered further interpretations of the GE interaction including differential genotype adaptation.

In Australia's highly modified Murray-Darling Basin, native fish arc imperilled and fish deaths in the Darling River in 2018-19 highlighted their vulnerability. Golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) is a long-lived percichthyid that was conspicuous in the fish kills. To guide population rehabilitation in the Darling River, pre-fish kill age structure, provenance and movement of golden perch were explored using otolith microstructure and chemistry (Sr-87/Sr-86). Across the Lower and Mid-Darling River, recruitment was episodic, with dominant cohorts associated with years characterised by elevated discharge. There was substantial variability in age structure, recruitment source and movement patterns between the Lower and Mid-Darling River. In the Mid-Darling River, tributaries were an important recruitment source, whereas in the Lower Darling fish predominantly originated in the Darling River itself. Downstream movement of juveniles, upstream migration of adults and return movements to natal locations were important drivers of population structure. Restoring resilient golden perch populations in the Darling River will be reliant on mitigating barriers to movement, promoting a connected mosaic of recruitment sources and reinstating the hydrological and hydraulic factors associated with spawning, recruitment and dispersal. Globally, increasing water resource development and climate change will necessitate such integrated approaches to the management of long-lived migratory riverine fishes.

Long-term livestock exclusion increases plant richness and reproductive capacity in arid woodlands	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Herbivore exclusion is implemented globally to recover ecosystems from grazing by introduced and native herbivores, but evidence for large-scale biodiversity benefits is inconsistent in arid ecosystems. We examined the effects of livestock exclusion on dryland plant richness and reproductive capacity. We collected data on plant species richness and seeding (reproductive capacity), rainfall, vegetation productivity and cover, soil strength and herbivore grazing intensity from 68 sites across 6500 km(2) of arid Georgina gidgee (Acacia georginae) woodlands in central Australia between 2018 and 2020. Sites were on an actively grazed cattle station and two destocked conservation reserves. We used structural equation modeling to examine indirect (via soil or vegetation modification) versus direct (herbivory) effects of grazing intensity by two introduced herbivores (cattle, camels) and a native herbivore (red kangaroo), on seasonal plant species richness and seeding of all plants, and the richness and seeding of four plant groups (native grasses, forbs, annual chenopod shrubs, and palatable perennial shrubs). Non-native herbivores had a strong indirect effect on plant richness and seeding by reducing vegetative ground cover, resulting in decreased richness and seeding of native grasses and forbs. Herbivores also had small but negative direct impacts on plant richness and seeding. This direct effect was explained by reductions in annual chenopod and palatable perennial shrub richness under grazing activity. Responses to grazing were herbivore-dependent; introduced herbivore grazing reduced native plant richness and seeding, while native herbivore grazing had no significant effect on richness or seeding of different plant functional groups. Soil strength decreased under grazing by cattle but not camels or kangaroos. Cattle had direct effects on palatable perennial shrub richness and seeding, whereas camels had indirect effects, reducing richness and seeding by reducing the abundance of shrubs. We show that considering indirect pathways improves evaluations of the effects of disturbances on biodiversity, as focusing only on direct effects can mask critical mechanisms of change. Our results indicate substantial biodiversity benefits from excluding livestock and controlling camels in drylands. Reducing introduced herbivore impacts will improve soil and vegetation condition, ensure reproduction and seasonal persistence of species, and protect native plant diversity.

Results showed the largest irrigation depth led to reductions in irrigation and crop evapotranspiration (ETc) with slightly increased cotton yields compared to the baseline scenarios under different hydroclimatic regimes. However, soil water content and surface runoff values were increased when using the largest irrigation depth. The opposite results were observed for the small irrigation depth. Early planting of cotton resulted in decreased irrigation and ETc, and increased cotton yields under both irrigated and dryland conditions, particularly in normal and wet years. By contrast, the late planting scenarios indicated the opposite for those variables. Simulated hydrologic variables were relatively stable using various maturity cultivars. Nevertheless, greater than 10% reductions in irrigated cotton yield under diverse hydroclimatic years and dryland yields during normal and wet years were identified in the long-season cotton. The opposite was determined for the short-season cotton. These outcomes suggest that a larger irrigation depth, earlier planting date, and short-season cultivar are promising cultivation practices for improving cotton yield and water conservation in the Texas Panhandle.

Using Integrated Analysis Tool, a rule-based dynamic simulation model, this study tried to improve the performance of major farming systems in the Tamil Nadu State of India. Amongst the four major farming systems viz. Black gram-based (BFS), Paddy-based (PFS), and Integrated Farming Systems (IFS) in Villupuram district and Dryland Farming System (DFS) in Virudhunagar district, IFS was found to be the most profitable and resilient based on their performance simulated for a 3-year rotation. Setting IFS as a benchmark, potential interventions were evaluated under other farming systems to improve their relative performance. The analysis allowed understanding the interactions in smallholder farming systems and the potential impact of interventions in a whole farm way considering the cash flows, cost intensity, and input-output trade-offs. While multi-bloom technology in black gram increased the net profit of BFS without much stress on input and labour, area expansion under rainfed groundnut incurred high expenditure. Trading-off paddy with maize and groundnut significantly increased the net profit of PFS but replacing sugarcane with tapioca and turmeric was not remunerative. Improved livestock management practices have substantially increased the net profit of DFS wherein crop yield could not be enhanced substantially without the prospects of good irrigation infrastructure. The irrigation endowed PFS has achieved 90% performance, whereas the water-starved BFS and DFS could achieve only 65% performance of IFS. We conclude that agricultural policy must not only focus on potential interventions that are profitable but also consider what is acceptable to the farmer, considering synergies and trade-offs between competing resources at the farm level.

Effects of aquatic vegetation cover (Schoenoplectus decipiens) on microalgal biomass and assemblage structure in temporary wetlands of a semi-arid region (Eastern Cape Karoo, South Africa)	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Temporary depression wetlands are often overlooked from a conservation and research perspective, despite recent evidence suggesting that their cumulative contribution to biodiversity at the landscape level is substantial. Here, we present observations aimed at understanding the significance of macrophyte cover in relation to the lower trophic levels, more particularly microalgae, within these highly dynamic wetlands. Thirteen such wetlands were sampled during October 2015, December 2015 and March 2016 in the Eastern Cape Karoo region of South Africa, to test the hypotheses that densely vegetated wetlands will have lower microalgal biomass and smaller algal size classes than sparsely vegetated wetlands. PERMANOVA results indicated that neither planktonic nor benthic microalgal biomass differed significantly between macrophyte cover categories (sparse, moderate and extensive cover), although there was a strong difference between the planktonic and benthic biotopes themselves. Planktonic and benthic microalgal assemblages were dominated by cryptophytes and chrysophytes (flagellates) throughout the study, with smaller nanoplankton being more abundant in wetlands with moderate or extensive macrophyte cover and larger microplankton dominating sparsely vegetated sites. Median benthic diatom species richness and diversity were higher under sparse macrophyte cover, but these differences were not significant, and no convincing evidence was found for an effect of macrophyte cover on microalgal biomass and assemblage composition in these temporary wetlands. Using distance-based Redundancy Analysis, dissolved inorganic nitrogen appeared to be the only environmental predictor for which a significant relationship with microalgal assemblage composition was reported. This study adds to the evidence from other assemblages (e.g. invertebrates) suggesting that the generalist nature of species occupying these systems allows them to adapt to the ever-changing conditions typical of ephemeral environments. ? 2020 SAAB.

Its structure, composition and spatial patterns are key controls of biotic interactions, water, and nutrient cycles. Applying segmentation methods to very high-resolution images for monitoring changes in vegetation cover can provide relevant information for dryland conservation ecology. For this reason, improving segmentation methods and understanding the effect of spatial resolution on segmentation results is key to improve dryland vegetation monitoring. We explored and analyzed the accuracy of Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Mask R-CNN) and the fusion of both methods in the segmentation of scattered vegetation in a dryland ecosystem. As a case study, we mapped Ziziphus lotus, the dominant shrub of a habitat of conservation priority in one of the driest areas of Europe. Our results show for the first time that the fusion of the results from OBIA and Mask R-CNN increases the accuracy of the segmentation of scattered shrubs up to 25% compared to both methods separately. Hence, by fusing OBIA and Mask R-CNNs on very high-resolution images, the improved segmentation accuracy of vegetation mapping would lead to more precise and sensitive monitoring of changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services in drylands.

Measuring NDVI throughout a growing season helps to evaluate the effect of continuous phenological and morphological changes on grain yield. A 2-year field study was conducted to characterize plant response to water stress in 20 winter wheat (Triticum aestium L.) genotypes during the season based on their NDVI values under the dryland and irrigated conditions. In addition, final biomass and yield were measured at maturity. The 2018 season was extremely dry with only 23 mm of precipitation, whereas 2016 was more favorable for wheat production with 315 mm seasonal precipitation. Except in a severe drought condition (2018, dryland), NDVI values increased from early spring to mid-season (anthesis) and decreased from mid-season to physiological maturity, indicating gradual leaf senescence. There was a significant (P = 0.05) positive correlation between NDVI and grain yield, especially for NDVI values after jointing. However, under the severe drought condition of 2018 (dryland), NDVI often did not show a strong relationship with grain yield. Even genotypes with higher NDVI at early growth stages ended up with lower yield because of the severe water stress at later growth stages. Hence, the use of NDVI is not suggested in screening genotypes for yield under extreme weather conditions.

Given the development of occasional flash floods in the central part of the Red Sea area can be of destructive consequences to the various anthropogenic activities; thus the quantitative and qualitative assessments of the hydrological parameters and groundwater occurrence are presented. As a case study, Wadi Isl at the Red Sea coast has been hydrogeologically analyzed using an integrative approach of remote sensing, GIS and direct current resistivity (DCR) tools. The time area-zones have been estimated using and Manning's equation into the spatial analyses routines embedded within the ArcGIS. In this study, a synthetic effective rainfall of 10 mm has been applied to compute the spatially distributed runoff hydrograph. The estimated total runoff volume is approximately 8 million cubic meters, and the peak discharge rate is estimated to 163 cubic meters per second, which can be destructive to the main infrastructures in the flash flood pathways. Then, the 2D-electrical resistivity tomography (2D-ERT) surveys have been carried out at various localities along the main wadi course to explore the lateral and vertical variation of alluvium thickness and the saturated zones. Notably, the groundwater occurrence is contained in the structurally controlled graben. Therefore, the study has recommended the construction a main barrier at a natural deep gorge of the main outlet in order to fully control the flash floods and to enhance the potential recharge to the underlying alluvium aquifer. The present integrative approach of both surface and subsurface data is definitely needed to maximize the flash flood benefits.

However, there is still a shortage of approaches to achieve this matching, especially for dryland areas, where ecosystems are more vulnerable and sensitive than other areas, and mismatches between institutions and ecological processes can cause worse consequences in a shorter time. By drawing on the cases of SES management in dryland areas, we propose three distinct but complementary approaches to promote SES fit based on comprehensive and systematic analyses, which can be summarized as structural, dynamic, and scale approaches. These approaches could contribute to enhance the fit of SES, but more quantitative indicators and tools are needed to analyze complex SES structure?function relationships.

Weibei Dryland is considered an example to use to evaluate changes in nitrogen (N) flows through the food chain following conversion of croplands to apple orchards, using the Nutrient flows in Food Chains, Environment and Resources Use (NUFER) model, and we also modelled the effects of 20% reduction in N fertilizers on apple yields to obtain a balanced fertilization strategy. The apple orchards area increased from 9.6 x 10(4) ha in 1978 to 72 x 10(4) ha in 2013, while the area under cereals decreased from 186 x 10(4) ha in 1978 to 152 x 10(4) ha in 2013. The increased income due to apple orchards led on-one-hand to more N fertilization to get a higher apple yield, and on-the-other-hand promoted the consumption of animal foods. Consequently, nitrogen use efficiency of crop production (NUEc) and the combination of crop and animal production (NUEc+a) decreased, but nitrogen use efficiency of animal production (NUEa) and N losses increased between 1978 and 2013. The modelled scenario of 20% reduction in N fertilization amounts will still keep optimum apple yield but will significantly decrease N losses from the apple orchards. We therefore, suggest that the key measures for improving nitrogen use efficiency and decreasing N losses after conversion to cash crops are: (a) reducing N fertilization as well as balancing various inorganic fertilizers; and (b) implying organic fertilizers.					zamanian, kazem/B-3032-2008; Razavi, Bahar S./S-7262-2017; Zhang, Xuechen/AFU-9165-2022	zamanian, kazem/0000-0002-9536-9251; Razavi, Bahar S./0000-0002-3726-8268; Zhang, Xuechen/0000-0002-6381-6627													1085-3278	1099-145X				FEB 15	2021	32	3					1103	1113		10.1002/ldr.3680	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.3680		AUG 2020											WOS:000554495000001

Thus, water-permeable plastic film (WPF) that can retain ineffective precipitation and biodegradable film (BF) that can be degraded were developed. However, the yield performance using WPF and BF varied a lot in different crops and experimental sites as compared with PEF. Here, we evaluated the applicability of WPF and BF as alternatives to PEF on millet, sorghum and corn with different growth periods on the northern Loess Plateau of China. Our results showed that, compared with PEF, ineffective precipitation was successfully preserved and soil water storage was 13-19 mm higher under WPF. Furthermore, the activities of urease, alkaline phosphatase, catalase, and contents of soil NO3--N, available phosphorus were also higher under WPF, due to the improved soil water conditions and mitigated soil temperature. Consequently, the yields of the three crops were 5-18% higher under WPF. The yield under BF did not decrease in millet, while it was 8-15% lower in sorghum and corn than that under PEF. When a large area of BF cracks appeared, sorghum and corn were in the middle growth period with a low leaf area index (LAI), and the rainy season did not come yet; but for millet, it coincided with the rainy season in its late growth period with a high LAI. Therefore, compared with PEF, soil water storage was 9-30 mm lower under BF in sorghum and corn during the middle growth stage, which resulted in lower soil enzyme activities and nutrient contents. In conclusion, as an alter-native to PEF, WPF application is favorable in areas with high ineffective precipitation, and BF application is not suitable for crops with long growth period and low LAI.

The aim of this paper is to understand variation in emission in different production systems and it is also important for developing mitigation interventions that work for a specific production system. Design/methodology/approach In this study, the authors used the Global Livestock Environmental Assessment interactive model (GLEAM-i) to estimate the GHG emission and emission intensity and tested the effectiveness of mitigation strategies from 180 farms under three production systems in northern Ethiopia, namely, pastoral, mixed and urban production systems. Findings Production systems varied in terms of herd composition, livestock productivity, livestock reproductive parameters and manure management systems, which resulted in difference in total GHG emission. Methane (82.77%) was the largest contributor followed by carbon dioxide (13.40%) and nitrous oxide (3.83%). While both total carbon dioxide and methane were significantly higher (p< 0.05) in urban production system than the other systems emission intensities of cow's milk and goat and sheep's meat were lower in urban systems. Improvement in feed, manure management and herd parameters resulted in reduction of total GHG emission by 30, 29 and 21% in pastoral, mixed and urban production systems, respectively. Originality/value This study is a first time comparison of the GHG emission production by various production systems in northern Ethiopia. Moreover, it uses the GLEAM-i program for the first time in the ex ante settings for measuring and comparing emissions as well as for developing mitigation scenarios. By doing so, it provides information on the various livestock production system properties that contribute to the increase or decrease in GHG emission and helps in developing guidelines for low emission livestock production systems.																			1756-8692	1756-8706				DEC 7	2020	12	5			SI		669	685		10.1108/IJCCSM-09-2019-0060	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJCCSM-09-2019-0060		AUG 2020											WOS:000565946100001

Functional heterogeneity of habitats and dry season forage variability in an Okavango Delta landscape, northern Botswana	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The late dry season is a period when forage resources become limited in some African savannas that can induce a strong demographic bottleneck in herbivore populations with limited access to resource heterogeneity. This study determined forage quality and quantity between wetlands and drylands habitats during the late dry season. We subjectively sampled forage characteristics in four habitat types around the distal reaches of the Tsum Tsum floodplains of the Okavango Delta during the late dry season of 2015. The habitat types were mopane and sandveld woodland far from floodplains (two major dryland habitat types), sandveld habitats that receive soil moisture inputs from adjacent floodplains (wet sandveld) and sedgeland habitat within the floodplain. Leaves collected from forage in each habitat type were oven dried, milled and analysed for total nitrogen. Data of greenness, height, biomass and protein were analysed using Kruskal-Wallis test. Forage in wet sandveld had by far the highest protein content (similar to 16%) of all habitat types but forage height and biomass were very low, whereas sedgelands had the highest biomass of adequate-quality forage, while dryland communities had the lowest quantity and quality of forage. Thus, foraging between a higher-biomass, adequate-quality reserve resource (sedgeland) and a high-quality but low-quantity bridging resource (wet sandveld) can help to ensure a balanced protein and fibre intake during the late dry season. Our study demonstrated the importance of wetland habitats for providing green forage with sufficient biomass and protein to sustain herbivores over the late dry season.																			0140-1963	1095-922X				DEC	2021	195								104613	10.1016/j.jaridenv.2021.104613	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2021.104613		AUG 2021											WOS:000697775400001
J	Gomes, M; Ralph, TJ; Humphries, MS; Bamford, M				Gomes, Megan; Ralph, Timothy J.; Humphries, Marc S.; Bamford, Marion			Valley-scale controls and hydrogeomorphic processes driving channel breakdown in a dynamic floodplain wetland system: The Mara River, Tanzania	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The character and behaviour of dryland rivers are driven by complex interactions between extrinsic and intrinsic controls. A long-term perspective is necessary to assess the sensitivity of dryland rivers to extrinsic forcing, such as hydroclimatic changes, and to contextualise the threshold channel responses. The semi-arid Mara River in northern Tanzania is the only perennial river in the UNESCO World Heritage Serengeti-Mara ecosystem and provides water resources for human and wildlife populations. Satellite imagery and discharge modelling were used to assess the valley-scale controls and hydrogeomorphic processes driving the morphological adjustments of the lower Mara River and its floodplain wetland. Both the modern and palaeochannels undergo downstream morphological and hydrological changes as they traverse the broad, alluvial floodplain. In response to marked downstream declines in discharge (from similar to 300 m(3).s(-1) to -45 m(3).s(-1)) and stream power (from similar to 40 W.m(-2) to -0.5 W.m(-2)), the modern channel exhibits a nonequilibrium river response resulting in downstream declines in channel size (from similar to 60 m to similar to 10 m wide) and eventual channel breakdown in the floodplain wetland. Palaeochannels in the unconfined reaches are typically larger with higher palaeodischarges than the modern channel. While some palaeochannels exhibit similar downstream trends to the modern channel, others may have maintained a continuous channel farther into the wetland. Comparison of the Mara River to other dryland river systems highlights the importance of valley setting and hydroclimate as long-term controls that influence geomorphic river response over time. The lower Mara River represents a nonequilibrium river response to declining discharges related to transmission losses that leads to channel bed aggradation and avulsion, constituting an inherent condition in many dryland alluvial rivers. An improved understanding of the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic controls is important for the assessment of river character, behaviour, and floodplain wetland development, particularly under future projections of more variable or extreme climate conditions.

Here, we report the results of the year-round monitoring (November 2018-October 2019) of SDMV and xylem sap flow obtained using high-resolution dendrometers and Granier-type thermal dissipation probes, respectively, in mature trees of three species in the semiarid Loess Plateau region: Quercus liaotungensis, Platycladus orientalis, and Robinia pseudoacacia. The year-round trend for the variations in stem diameter can be divided into phases of a decreasing period and a relatively stable period in the non-growing season, and a progressive rise and fluctuating plateau throughout the growing season. The observed interspe-cific differences in the time to full recovery from the water deficit state corresponded to species phenology and soil moisture conditions. These differences were manifested as the responses of sap flux density (Fd) and tree water deficit (TWD) to variations in soil water content during the growing season. Q. liaotungensis implements stomatal regulation early to avoid drastic water loss in the trunk, P. orientalis maintains a relatively stable Fd at the expense of increased TWD under soil drought, and R. pseudoacacia maintains relatively low stomatal conductance under soil drought with an increase in TWD. The results revealed that SDMV is determined by the stem water status and species-specific strategies for water use, which could provide beneficial information for forestation practices in semiarid regions.																			1125-7865	1612-0051				DEC	2023	82								126146	10.1016/j.dendro.2023.126146	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dendro.2023.126146													WOS:001104300300001

These insights originate from land surface models (LSMs) that have not been extensively calibrated and evaluated for water-limited ecosystems. We need to learn more about dryland carbon dynamics, particularly as the transitory response and rapid turnover rates of semi-arid systems may limit their function as a carbon sink over multi-decadal scales. We quantified aboveground biomass carbon (AGC; inferred from SMOS L-band vegetation optical depth) and gross primary productivity (GPP; from PML-v2 inferred from MODIS observations) and tested their spatial and temporal correspondence with estimates from the TRENDY ensemble of LSMs. We found strong correspondence in GPP between LSMs and PML-v2 both in spatial patterns (Pearson's r = 0.9 for TRENDY-mean) and in inter-annual variability, but not in trends. Conversely, for AGC we found lesser correspondence in space (Pearson's r = 0.75 for TRENDY-mean, strong biases for individual models) and in the magnitude of inter-annual variability compared to satellite retrievals. These disagreements likely arise from limited representation of ecosystem responses to plant water availability, fire, and photodegradation that drive dryland carbon dynamics. We assessed inter-model agreement and drivers of long-term change in carbon stocks over centennial timescales. This analysis suggested that the simulated trend of increasing carbon stocks in drylands is in soils and primarily driven by increased productivity due to CO2 enrichment. However, there is limited empirical evidence of this 50-year sink in dryland soils. Our findings highlight important uncertainties in simulations of dryland ecosystems by current LSMs, suggesting a need for continued model refinements and for greater caution when interpreting LSM estimates with regards to current and future carbon dynamics in drylands and by extension the global carbon cycle.

J	Liu, XF; Han, MX; Zhang, L				Liu, Xufei; Han, Mengxue; Zhang, Lin			A new subsurface ceramic emitter for smallholders without pumps: design, hydraulic performance, and field application	IRRIGATION SCIENCE												Dryland water resource scarcity has been the most challenging issue facing the continuous development of irrigated agricultural systems. Although drip irrigation, especially subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) technology, reduced water loss from soil evaporation and increased water use efficiency (WUE), drip emitter with pumps brought large electric energy consumption and management cost, limiting its application for smallholders in dryland. Therefore, a new subsurface ceramic emitter (SCE) without using pumps, which consisted of a porous ceramic diaphragm, plastic washers, and plastic shells, was designed for smallholders in this study. Then its application effects were estimated using hydraulic, soil bin, pot, and field experiments. The results showed that the discharge of SCE in the air had a positive linear relationship with the working water head. The discharge of SCE in soil presented a power function relationship with the working water head, and the discharge exponent was 0.40. It was recommended that SCE should install at flat farmland with a topographic slope less than & PLUSMN; 5 & PTSTHOUSND; to acquire an acceptable coefficient of uniformity (CU) under the working water head of more than 40 cm. A field experiment in Northwest China showed that SCE with a working water head of 60 cm created a suitable water moisture environment and CU, improving fruit yield and WUE of wolfberry. This provided an alternative irrigation method using SCE with a lower working water head for smallholders in dryland while ensuring a good CU.

Drylands are usually sparsely vegetated, and biological soil crusts (biocrusts) - that is, soil surface communities of cyanobacteria, mosses and/or lichens - can cover up to 70% of dryland cover. As they control key ecosystem processes, monitoring their spatial and temporal distribution can provide highly valuable information. In this study, we examine the potential of European Space Agency's (ESA) Sentinel-2 (S2) data to characterize the spatial and temporal development of biocrust and vascular plant greening along a rainfall gradient of the Negev Desert (Israel). First, the chlorophyll a absorption feature in the red region (CRred) was identified as the index mostly sensitive to changes in biocrust greening but minimally affected by changes in soil moisture. This index was then computed on the S2 images and enabled monitoring the phenological dynamics of different dryland vegetation components from August 2015 to August 2017. The analysis of multi-temporal S2 images allowed us to successfully track the biocrust greening within 15 days from the first seasonal rain events in the north of Negev, and to identify the maximum development of annual vascular plants and greening of perennial ones. These results show potential for monitoring arid and semi-arid environments using the newly available S2 images, allowing new insights into dryland vegetation dynamics.

However, there have been few attempts to estimate the effects of land cover change and land degradation on ecosystem services at large spatial scales and under the strong influence of human activities. Here, we used the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative land cover maps (1992-2015) and the value transfer valuation method to estimate the changes in ecosystem services value (ESV) in response to land cover change in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Moreover, we estimated the loss of ESV due to land degradation by using the long-term (1992-2015) trend in the annual normalized difference vegetation index as a proxy for longterm biomass productivity decline. Our results revealed that, between 1992 and 2015, cropland increased by about 20 million ha, largely at the expense of forest and shrubland. The total estimated ESV of SSA was about US $9 trillion year(-1), of which 55% was derived from cropland and deciduous forest, with comparable contributions. Land cover change resulted in a net increase in the total ESV by US$125 billion year(-1) (1992-2015), albeit with an ESV loss of US$60 billion year -1 from the conversion of evergreen forest and shrubland. Overall, cropland expansion accounted for about 60% of the increase in the total ESV (US$125 billion year(-1)), thereby outweighing the decrease in ESV due to the decline in natural vegetation. Land degradation hotspots covered about 5% of SSA, resulting in a total ESV loss of about US$56 billion year(-1), of which nearly 65% was due to the degradation of forests and croplands. Changes in ESV varied across sub-regions, climate zones, and countries, depending on the dominant land cover change and the extent of land degradation. Our results provide useful insights for making informed decisions towards sustainable use and management of ecosystems.

Effects of exposure of the leaf abaxial surface to direct solar radiation on the leaf anatomical traits and photosynthesis of soybean (Glycine max L.) in dryland farming systems	PHOTOSYNTHETICA												The frequent occurrence of monsoon winds usually leads to the formation of inverted soybean leaves. However, the effect of leaf inversion on photosynthetic capacity remains unclear. The responses of leaf anatomical traits, chlorophyll fluorescence induction kinetics parameters, photosynthetic capacity, and nonstructural carbohydrates of fully expanded leaves to inversion of leaves in two soybean cultivars were studied. Leaf inversion decreased the stomatal size and thickness of developed leaves. The net photosynthetic rate was significantly reduced under leaf inversion, which resulted from reduced excitation energy trapping and electron transport of PSII reaction center. Leaf inversion increased leaf temperature 10 d after leaf inversion but reduced the instantaneous water-use efficiency compared to normally oriented leaves. Due to the decreased light-saturated net photosynthetic rate, the soluble sugars of light-sensitive cultivar decreased significantly. In summary, leaf inversion deactivated the PSII reaction centers, reduced photosynthesis and nonstructural carbohydrates in upper canopy soybean leaves.

Are drought indices and climate data good indicators of ecologically relevant soil moisture dynamics in drylands?	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Droughts are disproportionately impacting global dryland regions where ecosystem health and function are tightly coupled to moisture availability. Drought severity is commonly estimated using algorithms such as the standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI), which can estimate climatic water balance impacts at various hydrologic scales by varying computational length. However, the performance of these metrics as indicators of soil moisture dynamics at ecologically relevant scales, across soil depths, and in consideration of broader scale ecohydrological processes, requires more attention. In this study, we tested components of climatic water balance, including SPEI and SPEI computation lengths, to recreate multi-decadal and periodic soilmoisture patterns across soil profiles at 866 sites in the western United States. Modeling results show that SPEI calculated over the prior 12-months was the most predictive computation length and could recreate changes in moisture availability within the soil profile over longer periods of time and for annual recharge of deeper soil moisture stores. SPEI was slightly less successful with recreating spring surface-soil moisture availability, which is key to dryland ecosystems dominated by winter precipitation. Meteorological drought indices like SPEI are intended to be convenient and generalized indicators of meteorological water deficit. However, the inconsistent ability of SPEI to recreate ecologically relevant patterns of soil moisture at regional scales suggests that processbased models, and the larger data requirements they involve, remain an important tool for dryland ecohydrology					Germino, Matthew J./F-6080-2013; Bradford, John/E-5545-2011	Germino, Matthew J./0000-0001-6326-7579; Bradford, John/0000-0001-9257-6303; O'Connor, Rory/0000-0002-6473-0032													1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2021	133								108379	10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108379	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108379		NOV 2021											WOS:000730169000002

Trend-cycles of vegetation dynamics as a tool for land degradation assessment and monitoring	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The use of time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), obtained from satellite sensors has become frequent in studies for land degradation assessment and monitoring. Linear trends of NDVI are usually considered as indicators of vegetation dynamics and widely used as proxies for land degradation. Yet, long-term trends of NDVI often exhibit unidirectional (monotonic) but also cyclic (non-monotonic) dynamics, including mid-term oscillations, both of which are poorly captured by linear trends. Trend-cycle is a time series analysis that represents a smoothed version of a seasonally adjusted time series, which provides information on long-term movements while including changes in direction underlying the series. We assessed NDVI trend-cycles in Patagonia (Argentina) as proxies for land dynamics, integrating trend and medium-term cycles (> 4 years). We used MODIS images between years 2000 and mid-2018; trend-cycles were analysed using the Basis Pursuit method. We observed that trend-cycles explained a significant portion of total temporal variability (reaching almost 20%), from which most patterns were explained by non-monotonic behaviour. We identified five major patterns in vegetation dynamics: decreasing (0.1% of area), increasing (0.6%), recovery (48.8%), relapsing (36.8%) and no trend-cycle (13.8%). Contrary to what is generally seen in the literature, monotonic patterns and particularly decreasing trend-cycles were marginally recorded in the last 18 years of NDVI records in Patagonia. Instead, the greater proportion of the area was classified as initial or advanced recovery and initial relapsing patterns, which refer to phases of a cyclic behaviour. We call for the need to revisit the conceptualization of land degradation assessment by means of remote sensing, and to critically review the ability of linear trends to reflect vegetation dynamics. Finally, we discuss the potential use of trend-cycle as a tool to monitor land dynamics and progress towards land degradation neutrality.

However, most of our understanding of N cycling is still based on human disturbed environments, and the microbial mechanisms governing N loss in low primary productivity environment remain unclear. This study explores three microbial N loss pathways in eight wetland and dryland soil profiles from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, at an elevation of above 5000 m with little human activity, using N-15 isotopic tracing slurry technology, quantitative PCR, and high-throughput sequencing. No denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation was detected. Anammox occurred in two of the wetland (n = 4) and dryland (n = 4) soil profiles, while denitrification widely occurred and was the dominant N loss pathway in all samples. Where denitrification and anammox co-occurred, both abundance and activity were higher in wetland than in dryland soils and higher in surface than in subsurface soils. In comparison with non-anammox sites, nitrate levels initiate anammox-related N cycling. High-throughput sequencing and network analysis of nirK, nirS, nosZ, and hzsB gene communities showed that Bradyrhizobiaceae (a family of rhizobia) may play a dominant role in N loss pathways in this region. Given the geological evolution and relatively undisturbed habitat, these findings strongly suggest that denitrification is the dominant N loss pathway in terrestrial habitats of the Qing-Tibet Plateau with minimal anthropogenic activity.

Though Mongolian grasslands are seriously degraded by livestock grazing, the effects of grazing on soil AMF and GRSP remain unclear. Here, we examined community composition and diversity of AMF as well as amount of GRSP at three different grazing intensities: lightly grazed (LG), moderately grazed (MG), and heavily grazed (HG) under two different types of grassland, mountain forest steppe at Hustai and desert steppe at Mandalgobi. The diversity and biomass of AMF-host and non-AMF plants strongly affected the overall AMF community composition and its diversity. When we separately analyzed the factors affecting soil AMF diversity at Hustai and Mandalgobi, decrease in the shoot biomass of Poaceae plants at Hustai and decreases in the species number and shoot biomass of AMF-host plants at Mandalgobi were significantly correlated with AMF diversity. GRSP decreased with increasing grazing intensity, which was significantly correlated with soil pH and total root biomass at Hustai. The decrease in plant biomass caused by grazing thus led to GRSP reduction. Our results showed that change in soil AMF community caused by livestock grazing were associated with change in the biomass and diversity of functional vegetation groups such as Poaeceae, AMF-host and non-AMF plants, indicating the importance to focus on such functional vegetation groups to evaluate the effect of grazing on AMF.

Farmers' Knowledge and Acceptance of Microalgae in Almeria Greenhouse Horticulture	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Almeria horticulture in SE Spain hosts the largest concentration of greenhouses in the world and faces important environmental sustainability challenges. Microalgae-derived applications are efficient nature-based solutions as they are used for wastewater regeneration or as biostimulants and biopesticides in agriculture. However, farmers' knowledge and acceptance of microalgaederived applications remain unknown, which is a major barrier to its commercialization. This study explores current farmers' knowledge and acceptance of microalgae in Almeria horticulture. Results revealed that there exists a significant lack of knowledge regarding the use of microalgae agriculturalbased applications. Over sixty percent of farmers indicated that microalgae can have beneficial uses in agriculture, such as biostimulants or biofertilizers. However, although seventy percent of farmers expressed their willingness to use them, results also showed that only 32% of farmers using microalgae-derived applications have obtained satisfactory results. We call the urgent need for new communication strategies based on transdisciplinary approaches that increase farmers' knowledge around the multiple microalgae-derived products and applications in agriculture.

In this study, we determined the effective granular PAM rate that best reduces runoff and soil loss from Oxisols. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the selected PAM rate was tested by applying it in a mixture with gypsum (G) or lime (L). The study was conducted in two phases: (i) Dry PAM rates of 0 (C), 20 kg ha(-1) (P20), 40 kg ha(-1) (P40), and 60 kg ha(-1) (P60) were applied onto soil surface and run for six consecutive rainfall storms of 70 mm h(-1) intensity for 1 h duration, and the effective PAM rate was selected; and (ii) G (4 t ha(-1)) or L (2 t ha(-1)) were applied alone or mixed with the selected PAM rate. The P20 was found to be effective in reducing runoff in the beginning while P40 and P60 were more effective starting from the third storm through the end of the consecutive storms, but with no statistically significant difference between P40 and P60. Hence, P40 was selected as the most suitable rate for the given test soil and rainfall pattern. On the other hand, the mixed application of P40 with G or L increased infiltration rate (IR) in the first two storms through improving soil solution viscosity. However, effectiveness of the mixtures had diminished by various degrees as rain progressed, as compared to P40 alone, which could be attributed to the rate and properties of G and L. In conclusion, the variation in effectiveness of PAM rates in reducing runoff with storm duration could indicate that the effective rates shall be selected based on the climatic region in that lower rates for the short rains or higher rates for elongated rains. Moreover, combined application of PAM with L could offer a good option to both fairly reduce soil erosion and improve land productivity especially in acidic soils like Oxisols, which requires further field verification.

Rapid climate change observably threatens vegetation growth and profoundly affects the global carbon cycle. However, interannual variations in vegetation growth, and changes in coupling between vegetation growth and precipitation in response to drought are not fully understood in the dryland ecosystems of the Silk Road Economic Belt (SREB). By combining remote sensing normalized vegetation indexes from GIMMS (GIMMS NDVI), simulated net primary productivity levels from TRENDYv2 (TRENDY NPP), terrestrial water storage change data (oTWS) derived from GRACE, and climate grid datasets, we investigated climate change, vegetation growth and nonlinear changes in coupling between vegetation growth and precipitation in the pregrowing and current seasons during 1982-2015. The results show intensified drought and extensive vegetation browning in all seasons, especially the summer, across the drylands of the SREB from 1993 to 2015. Precipitation in the pregrowing season significantly contributed to vegetation growth in the subsequent spring and summer, showing that the effects of precipitation in the pregrowing season on subsequent vegetation growth lags by almost two seasons. We also found that intensified drought significantly strengthened the coupling between vegetation growth and precipitation in the pregrowing and current seasons. These results highlight the nonlinear response of vegetation growth to intensified drought, and can be referenced to improve the coupling of land-atmospheric models for drylands.

Soil Structure Stability under Different Land Uses in Association with Polyacrylamide Effects	SUSTAINABILITY												Soil structural stability is a vital aspect of soil quality and functions, and of maintaining sustainable land management. The objective of this study was to compare the contribution of four long-term land-use systems (crop, bush, grass, and forest) coupled with anionic polyacrylamide (PAM = 0, 25, and 200 mg L-1) application on the structural stability of soils in three watersheds of Ethiopia varying in elevation. Effect of treatments on soil structural stability indices were assessed using the high energy moisture characteristic (HEMC, 0-50 hPa) method, which provides (i) water retention model parameters alpha and n, and (ii) soil structure index (SI). Soil (watershed), land use and PAM treatments had significant effects on the shape of the water retention curves (alpha, n) and SI, with diverse changes in the macropore sizes (60-250; >250 mu m). Soil organic carbon (SOC) content and SI were strongly related to soil pH, CaCO3 soil type-clay mineralogy, exchangeable Ca2+, and Na+ (negatively). The order of soil SI (0.013-0.064 hPa(-1)) and SOC (1.4-8.1%) by land use was similar (forest > grass > bush > cropland). PAM effect on increasing soil SI (1.2-2.0 times), was inversely related to SOC content, being also pronounced in soils from watersheds of low (Vertisol) and medium (Luvisol) elevation, and the cropland soil from high (Acrisol) elevation. Treating cropland soils with a high PAM rate yielded greater SI (0.028-0.042 hPa(-1)) than untreated bush- and grassland soils (0.021-0.033 hPa(-1)). For sustainable management and faster improvement in soil physical quality, soil properties, and land-use history should be considered together with PAM application.

In this study, data were collected using a phenomenological-based research design. Field observations, a questionnaire (n = 440), key informant interviews (10), and one focus group discussion (with seven discussants) were used to collect the desired data from flood-prone farmers. As the results show, 42% of the respondents believe that flooding has become stronger over the past 20 years, whereas 38% believe there has been no change. As mitigation measures, 52% of the respondents suggested evacuating to neighbouring villages as the best option. Most of the damage was experienced in farmlands (including crops, either harvested or standing) and settlements. As coping mechanisms, 31% of the respondents were displaced, whereas an additional 40% were forced to construct new houses for their settlement. Chi-square testing showed that the farmers' responses statistically varied among different groups (p < .001). In the meantime, community participation in flood control and catchment management is important. Improving flood management knowledge and the skills of different groups in a community is equally important. In this case, a qualitative inquiry approach was a good option to assess the hydrological conditions of rivers.

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the potential for incorporation into a durum wheat breeding program of 64 accessions of tetraploid wheats from six sub-species of Triticum turgidum, tested under rainfed (terminal drought stress) and irrigated (non-terminal drought stress) conditions during two cropping seasons. The accessions were assessed for twelve above-ground agro-physiological traits, drought tolerance and stability performance. The combined analysis of variance indicated that variability due to genotype, environment and genotype by environment (GE) interaction was highly significant (P < 0.01) for all traits tested into these experiments. Genotype, environment and GE interaction accounted for 34.2%, 27.8% and 25.3% of the total variation in grain yield, showing that this trait was mainly affected by genotypic variation. Based on the results, the genetic potential for high and stable grain yield and drought tolerance was found mainly in T. turgidum subsp. turgidum and T. turgidum subsp. durum, which could be explored in the durum breeding program. The cluster analysis revealed that the grouping patterns of tetraploid wheat accessions are not due to their geographical origin and their respective subspecies classification. Among the accessions, G56 (subsp. turgidum), G20, G63, G64, G6 and G4 (all belonging to subsp. durum) were the best in terms of providing high and stable grain yield in combination with breeder-preferred traits (i. e. earliness, higher kernel weight, and plant stature characteristics) adequate for drought tolerance. In conclusion, the identified accessions are valuable genetic resources that should be used directly for cultivar recommendation or to be crossed with native or commercial cultivars for improve yield productivity in durum wheat under the new circumstances of climatic change.

To reduce production costs, alternative feeding regimens with domestic forages, such as alfalfa hay (AH), are needed. We evaluated the effects of the AH feeding level on nitrogen balance and daily gain (DG) of Simmental calves by two feeding trials. In trial 1, when AH was consumed at 0%-19% of total dry matter intake, no clear effect of AH intake on metabolizable-protein supply and DG was observed. In trial 2, when more concentrate feed was fed than in trial 1, metabolizable-protein supply and nitrogen retention increased as the AH consumption rate increased (0%-38% of total intake); these effects appeared to be related to the DG increase.

Previous Loess Plateau studies employed individual models with specific emphases but model comparisons have not been undertaken so the relative performance of different models is not known. In this study we employed two extensively applied models (RUSLE and PESERA) to investigate the impact of LUCCs during 1990-2000 and 2000-2011 on soil erosion rates for a typical Loess Plateau catchment (i.e. Huangfuchuan), and compared their modelling results. Land-cover patterns for 1990, 2000 and 2011 were derived from Landsat images. The catchment was dominated by grassland (over 70%) and experienced considerable LUCCs: vegetation coverage increased from 38.3% in 1990 to 48.7% in 2011. Modelling results suggested that mean soil erosion rates of the catchment increased under the 1990-2000 LUCC and decreased under the 2000-2011 LUCC. Sandy land and scrubland were found to suffer from most severe soil erosion and thus should be the focus of future conservation work. Mean soil erosion rates on steep slopes (i.e. > 25 degrees) were predicted to increase under the 2000-2011 LUCC, implying that further work is still needed to study soil erosion processes and their conservation on steep slopes. Model comparisons showed that RUSLE predictions were higher than PESERA predictions for most areas (particularly for steep slopes), and the former were generally closer than the latter to check-dam sediment yield measurements. RUSLE and PESERA results were not linearly correlated, possibly due to differences in their underlying principles and their sensitivity to crucial parameters - RUSLE is more sensitive to slope gradients while PESERA is more sensitive to vegetation coverage. PESERA needs improvement to better account for steep slope erosion processes on the Loess Plateau, while RUSLE needs improvement in the description of vegetation effects.

The identification of genes that control this complex trait can provide important insights for alfalfa breeding. However, little is known about how alfalfa responds and adapts to drought stress, particularly in cultivars of differing drought tolerance. In this study, the drought-tolerant cultivar Dryland 'DT' and the drought-sensitive cultivar WL343HQ 'DS' were used to characterize leaf and root physiological responses and transcriptional changes in response to water deficit. Under drought stress, Dryland roots (DTR) showed more differentially expressed genes than WL343HQ roots (DSR), whereas WL343HQ leaves (DSL) showed more differentially expressed genes than Dryland leaves (DTL). Many of these genes were involved in stress-related pathways, carbohydrate metabolism, and lignin and wax biosynthesis, which may have improved the drought tolerance of alfalfa. We also observed that several genes related to ABA metabolism, root elongation, peroxidase activity, cell membrane stability, ubiquitination, and genetic processing responded to drought stress in alfalfa. We highlighted several candidate genes, including sucrose synthase, xylan 1,4-beta-xylosidase, primary-amine oxidase, and alcohol-forming fatty acyl-CoA reductase, for future studies on drought stress resistance in alfalfa and other plant species. In summary, our results reveal the unique drought adaptation and resistance characteristics of two alfalfa genotypes. These findings, which may be valuable for drought resistance breeding, warrant further gene functional analysis to augment currently available information and to clarify the drought stress regulatory mechanisms of alfalfa and other plants.																			0981-9428	1873-2690				SEP	2021	166						203	214		10.1016/j.plaphy.2021.05.008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2021.05.008		JUN 2021						34118683					WOS:000665139100019

Soil erosion resulted in homogenization of bacterial communities in the watershed.? Microbial community heterogeneity among erosion sites made soil tracing possible.? Assembly process results showed that the tracking results can achieve high precision.? Dryland was the main source of sediment deposition based on the result of FEAST.Sediment source tracing can accurately provide a theoretical basis for controlling soil erosion effectively, by identifying the most serious types of land use. Traditional sediment tracing methods are based on physical, chemical, biological, and composite fingerprinting, which have not included microbes. As high-throughput sequencing becomes more prevalent, microorganisms can provide more information than what we think. Thus, whether the microorganism can also be used as a special fingerprint factor for sediment source identification during soil erosion, we have tested it by using microbial source tracking tool FEAST to quantify the microbe contribution from five types of eroded land (including dryland, urban, paddy field, forest and grassland) to the depositional areas (Niubitan) in the Yuanjiang basin. The source microbial community in the erosive area was heterogeneous, and assembly process analysis further demonstrated that the source tracking results could reach higher accuracy. The results of FEAST showed that dryland (35.50%), urban (17.21%), paddy field (8.14%), and forest (1.07%) were the major contributors to Niubitan. Our results follow the general soil erosion rules and prove its validity. Taken together, a new perspective is provided by these results for tracing sediment sources in erosion-sedimentary systems.

Biogeochemical and ecosystem properties in three adjacent semi-arid grasslands are resistant to nitrogen deposition but sensitive to edaphic variability	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. Drylands have low nitrogen stocks and are predicted to be sensitive to modest increases in reactive nitrogen availability, but direct evidence that atmospheric nitrogen deposition will have sustained effects on dryland ecosystems is sparse and conflicting. 2. We used three long-running in situ nitrogen deposition simulation experiments and a complementary laboratory incubation experiment to address fundamental questions about how nitrogen inputs affect drylands: (1) What are the long- and short-term consequences of nitrogen inputs for biogeochemical and ecosystem properties?; (2) Do these consequences depend on soil moisture availability?; and (3) Does soil texture modify the effects of nitrogen inputs and/or soil moisture availability? 3. In 2011, we established three study sites along a soil texture gradient in Arches National Park with plots receiving 0, 2, 5 or 8 kg N ha(-1) annually (n = 5 per treatment per site). We assessed a suite of biogeochemical metrics over the long term and short term. To assess longer term effects, we sampled annually (2013-2019), just prior to spring nitrogen fertilization. To assess short-term effects, we sampled immediately before and after spring nitrogen fertilization in 2013. Additionally, we compared foliar chemistry, soil extracellular enzyme activities, heterotrophic respiration rates, and nitrogen trace gas fluxes at select intervals during the study period (2011-2019). Finally, we conducted a laboratory incubation to measure the individual and interacting effects of soil moisture and nitrogen additions on soil microbial activity. 4. We identified some short-term effects in situ, but no lasting consequences of added nitrogen for any of the metrics measured. In the incubation, soil moisture treatments independently increased heterotrophic respiration rates but did not modify the effects of added nitrogen. In contrast to nitrogen treatments, soil texture was associated with large differences in biogeochemical cycling. 5. Our results oppose the common prediction that coupled dryland biogeochemical cycles are sensitive to nitrogen inputs and suggest that fine-scale edaphic heterogeneity is a key driver of dryland ecosystem properties. 6. Synthesis. This study synthesizes a rare, long-term dataset, which provides robust evidence that carbon and nutrient cycling and availability are resistant to realistic levels of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in remote dryland ecosystems.

Previous studies suggest plastic mulch has risk to increase nitrous oxide emission, but how this produced by the complex interaction between soil properties and microbial is still an unsolved problem and need to research to develop targeted practice. Methods To address this question, molecular ecology tools, including real-time quantitative and high-throughput sequencing were employed to explore how plastic mulch induced change on soil environment and then stimulates denitrification. Three mulching treatments were compared, including no mulching, spring and autumn mulching. Results Plastic mulch induced significant increase in the richness and diversity of nir-containing denitrifiers. The nirS and nirK-gene abundance was the greatest under the autumn mulching, and a more conspicuous change in the community structure and abundance was observed for nirK gene than for nirS denitrifiers. The most differentially abundant taxa in the autumn mulching were Anaeromyxobacter, Terriglobus, Edwardsiella, Catenulispora and Acidobacterium for nirK genes and Cupriavidus for nirS genes. Mulching increased the potential denitrification enzyme activity by 58% and 29% for autumn and spring mulching, respectively, and this effect was mirrored by the abundance of nirK, but not by nirS denitrifiers. The nirK gene was significantly correlated to variations in soil moisture, temperature, and nitrate nitrogen. Conclusion Plastic mulch stimulates denitrification by inducing higher moisture, temperature and nitrate nitrogen content and structural change in the community of nirK denitrifying bacteria in dryland agroecosystems.																			0032-079X	1573-5036				2022 OCT 28	2022										10.1007/s11104-022-05754-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-022-05754-1		OCT 2022											WOS:000875598900002

The goal was to evaluate the trophic state index (TSI) of semi-arid reservoirs due to interannual variations of precipitation and stored volume. The study included 65 reservoirs in 8 NRB-based watersheds for 2008-2017. From 2013, NRB faced a severe drought that induced a significant reservoir volume reduction. Although the trophic state was already high before the drought (mostly eutrophic and hypereutrophic), the TSI of 91% of the reservoirs increased in the dry period. However, differently from the other watersheds, in which 100% TSI increase was observed for all reservoirs, the groundwater-rich and the lowest-water demand watersheds presented TSI decreases in 30 and 50% of the reservoirs, respectively. Thus, the impact of droughts on these two watersheds was less pronounced, as a potential result of groundwater flow with low-phosphorus concentration into the reservoirs of the former watershed, and lower nutrient loads/higher stored reservoir volumes of the latter one. Simple empirical equations, which are capable to estimate the mean TSI based solely on precipitation and reservoir volume, showed to be potential tools for integrated water management.

Despite decades of research and development efforts, land degradation remains a serious environmental problem in many parts of the world. Issues regarding the sustainability of current LUM initiatives are due to poor linkages between the ecological and socio-economic dimensions of LUM decisions, and an integrated framework allowing LUM interventions to be properly planned and implemented is lacking. In this study, we developed an integrated framework to identify, evaluate, and propose LUM alternatives with ecological and socio-economic benefits. The framework comprises six components: (i) identification of land use problems and setting of objectives, (ii) identification of the best-performing land use-based integrated solutions, (iii) formulation of LUM alternatives and modeling of key indicators, (iv) cost-benefit analysis, (v) evaluation of the LUM alternatives with stakeholders engagement, and (vi) communication of the LUM alternatives to relevant stakeholders to obtain institutional and financial support for implementation. To demonstrate the use of this framework, we conducted a case study in the Aba Gerima watershed of the Upper Blue Nile basin in Ethiopia. This study used extensive plot- and watershed-scale observations (2015-2019) obtained under both conventional and improved sustainable land management practices. We analyzed changes in runoff, soil loss, soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, and land productivity of five LUM alternatives as compared to a baseline scenario (existing farming practices). The results showed that the LUM alternatives reduced runoff by 11-71% and soil loss by 66-95%, and SOC stock and watershed-scale land productivity were improved by 36-104% and 48-134%, respectively. Evaluation of LUM alternatives by stakeholders, including land users, policy makers, and researchers, produced divergent results. In particular, land users prioritized implementation of sustainable land management practices without altering existing land uses. The integrated framework developed in this study can serve as a valuable tool for identifying, evaluating, and proposing LUM alternatives and facilitating decisionmaking in planning and implementation of LUM practices in watersheds experiencing land degradation.

Can biochar link forest restoration with commercial agriculture?	BIOMASS & BIOENERGY												The commercial use of low-value forest-origin biomass has long been considered for its potential to offset the cost of reducing wildfire hazard. The production of biochar simultaneously consumes low-value forest biomass and produces stable charcoal that, when applied to dryland agricultural soils, can increase water holding capacity and crop yield. In this way the production of forest-origin biochar has the potential to promote forest restoration, foster forest-related employment, increase agricultural competitiveness, and sequester carbon. Biochar offers the greatest opportunity where dryland food crops, limited water availability, existing energy transmission infrastructure, and high-fire hazard forests share the same landscape. In this paper we describe a landscape-level study based on this scenario to optimize wildfire hazard reduction treatments, biochar facility locations, and agroeconomic outcomes to evaluate the potential benefits needed to carry the costs of biochar production.

Removal or utilization? Testing alternative approaches to the management of an invasive woody legume in an arid Indian grassland	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Woody plant encroachment is a pervasive global driver impacting grassland structure and functioning, and we know very little about efficacies of management techniques for restoring woody plant-encroached tropical grasslands. In the Banni grasslands of India, which are extensively encroached by an invasive woody legume, Prosopis juliflora, we test the efficacies of two Prosopis management methods-mechanical removal and lopping-to restore native grasslands. Across eight sites in the Banni, using a randomized block design, we monitored herbaceous plant recovery in the two Prosopis management treatments, and an unmanipulated control for 4 years. We also sampled four reference grasslands. We found native herbaceous plant richness and cover to be threefold (mean = 6 species) and sixfold (mean = 18% cover) higher, respectively, in the mechanical-removal treatment compared to the control (mean richness = 2 species, cover = 3%), but found no significant differences between the lopping trsuseatment (mean richness = 5 species, cover = 11%) and the control. While mechanical-removal increased plant diversity, neither management treatment changed the species composition, and both of these treatments were still missing perennial grasses that dominate the reference grasslands. Our data highlight the efficacy of mechanical removal over lopping in restoring native grasslands. However, mechanically removing Prosopis is costly, especially at larger scales. Apart from its detrimental impact on grasslands, Prosopis also has benefits varying with stakeholder groups, and its removal involves complex trade-offs. Until we fully understand the trade-offs involved, it may therefore be better to manage this social-ecological landscape as a mosaic of restored grassland and Prosopis-invaded patches.

A depositional model for meandering rivers without land plants	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The recognition of meandering rivers in Earth's prevegetation stratigraphic record is hindered by an absence of depositional models specifically tailored to unvegetated single-channel rivers. As a result, their abundance on the early Earth is currently unknown. Here, sedimentological studies of two modern meandering river reaches with unvegetated banks were conducted. Both reaches are located in arid basins of Nevada, USA. Stratigraphy was analysed in conjunction with satellite imagery and high-resolution topographic data to understand how channels and floodplains record past flow conditions. Analyses of point-bar and channel-fill deposits showed that lateral accretion sets are not heterolithic but, rather, composed of mixed sand and sand-sized mud aggregates (clumps of clay and silt) interpreted to have formed through flocculation. Levees are present but subdued. Notably, downstream-migrating outer-bank-attached bars are prominent architectural features that may be common in unvegetated meandering rivers in arid landscapes elsewhere. The identification of such depositional elements in the stratigraphic record may enhance recognition of ancient unvegetated meandering rivers and improve reconstructions of palaeohydrology on early Earth and Mars.					; Lapotre, Mathieu/L-4910-2018	Marvin, M.

Shallot growth and yield supported by irrigation and nitrogen application in utilizing dry land area in Mesuji, Lampung Province, Indonesia	SAINS TANAH												Lampung Province, Indonesia local government intended to extend shallot cultivation in Mesuji Regency, Lampung (-3.86, 105.43). Mesuji has 21,863.5 ha dry land area, with unproductive land of 10,325.6 ha which could be potential for growing shallot. However, horticulture crops such as shallot often face obstacles in dry land since dry land characterized with poor soil nutrient and limited water. The objective of this research are to analyze the effects of nitrogen fertilizer and different irrigation volumes on shallot growth and production, investigate shallot suitability to Mesuji agro-climate, and estimate shallot yield potential in Mesuji. The treatments on factorial split block were: without N, 80 kg N ha(-1) , 160 kg N ha(-1) , and 240 kg N ha(-1) and the irrigation levels: 25, 50, 75 and 100% of ETc; ETc is crops evapotranspiration. The Mesuji agro-climate was evaluated using standardized precipitation index (SPI) and the yield was simulated by Aquacrop model. The results showed that the effort of shallots production with a high fresh weight of bulbs and biomass in the Mesuji area requested water at least 75% ETc and N fertilizer doses of 160 kg N ha(-1) . The SPI indicated near normal condition was more than 65%, and drought existed in a small percentage in both places (a total of 16.9% for Brebesthe centre of shallot production and 19.43% for Mesuji). The AquaCrop simulation gave a good yield estimation (simulated 19.451 ton ha(-1 )and observed 17.351 ton ha-1 ). There is a possibility that shallot will grow well in the Mesuji area even though the quality of the shallot should be further tested.																			1412-3606	2356-1424				JUN	2023	20	1					100	113		10.20961/stjssa.v20i1.70711	http://dx.doi.org/10.20961/stjssa.v20i1.70711													WOS:001087658100011

Environmental impacts such as the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) associated with grain production are well documented and the Australian grains industry has strived to ensure ongoing improvement. To facilitate this improvement, the industry funded the development of life cycle inventories to provide broad geographical coverage. Cradle-to-gate inventories for wheat were developed for each of the grains industry agro-ecological zones, and inventories were developed for minor cereal crops (e.g. barley, sorghum), oilseeds (i.e. canola) and legumes where relevant. Data for inventory development were taken from numerous sources and validated by using data collected through interviews with experts in each agro-ecological zone. Inventory data were also collected so that indicators in addition to global-warming impacts could be assessed. Global warming impacts for wheat production ranged from 193 to 567 kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-e) t(-1), and global warming impacts were 597-851, 333-361, 169-285 and 74-672 kg CO2-e t(-1) for canola, sorghum, barley and grain-legume production, respectively. Results for eutrophication, freshwater ecotoxicity, land-use and abiotic depletion (fossil-fuel use) are also presented.

The present study investigated the effects of combined organic fertilizer and straw return on soil nutrient status, soil nitrate-N distribution, and crop productivity in rainfed maize-wheat rotation on the southeast Loess Plateau. Based on a long-term field fertilization experiment, we reported the effects of four fertilizer management strategies (i.e., chemical NP fertilizers [NP, conventional practice]; chemical NPK fertilizers [NPK]; chemical NP fertilizers combined with organic fertilizer [NPOF]; and chemical NP fertilizers combined with organic fertilizer and straw return [NPOFS]) on productivity in summer maize and winter wheat from 2015 to 2020 season and the soil properties in the 0-60-cm soil layer and the soil nitrate-N distribu-tion in the 0-380-cm soil layer at maturity of winter wheat in 2020. The results averaged from 2015 to 2020 showed that NPOFS increased the grain yield of summer maize by 10.34-11.25%, and water use efficiency by 21.44-32.54%, compared with NP, NPK, and NPOF; however, it had no significant effect on winter wheat yield. All four treatments benefited topsoil (0-20 cm) properties, and NPOFS was superior to NP, NPK, and NPOF in increasing the content of soil organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and available potassium, in the 0-60-cm soil layer. Meanwhile, compared with NP and NPK, NPOFS significantly increased soil nitrate-N accumulation by 63.22% and 49.87%, respectively, in the 0-100-cm soil layer and decreased by 24.78% and 10.19%, respectively, in the 200-380-cm soil layer. These results suggest that the combination of organic fertilizer and straw return could improve soil fertility and summer maize productivity and significantly reduce nitrate-N accumulation in the 200-380-cm soil layer. Their use should be recommended for coordinated crop productivity and the soil environment in rainfed summer maize-winter wheat rotation on the southeast Loess Plateau.

GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING												The dynamics of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) is key to understand the global carbon cycle. Multiple GPP products are currently available based on remote sensing, Light Use Efficiency model (LUE) or diagnostic biophysical model. However, little knowledge is available on the spatial patterns of the uncertainty of different GPP products and their potential drivers over the Central Asia (CA), a fragile environment for accurate GPP estimation. This study investigates the sensitivity of the 8-day, monthly and yearly GPP uncertainties based on the three-cornered hat (TCH) method and Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) model in terms of vegetation, energy, water, climate and terrain factors in the dryland ecosystem during the 2003-2015 period. Ten GPP products were examined, including one product (FLUXCOM) from machine learning (ML), six products (EC-LUE, FluxSat, LUEopt, MODIS, MuSyQ and VPM) based on the (LUE), two products (GOSIF and NIRv) from satellite-based direct proxies (Proxies) and one product (PML) from the diagnostic biophysical model. The results indicate that the spatial distribution of the ten GPP products in CA showed similar patterns at different time scales, but with values varied at different products and time scales. According to the eddy covariance (EC) observations and the TCH-based uncertainties, the FLUXCOM product showed smaller relative uncertainties than other products. The attribution analysis denotes that the sources of uncertainty of the GPP varied for each product, and thus the improvement strategies for different products should be implemented separately The FLUXCOM should adapt the vegetation- related module to the dryland environment of CA. The LUE model should optimize the LUE parameters for the dryland ecosystem and incorporate the water related variables in the model. The Proxies model should incorporate the water and energy variables (such as soil moisture and radiation) as input data to improve their performance in CA. The diagnostic model should consider the elevation variable as input data, which may improve the performance of the PML in CA. Our results do not only provide an important basis for the selection of GPP products in the study of the carbon cycle in CA, but also offer a new insight into the GPP model development and improvement for the dryland ecosystem.

Buckwheat can act as a potent allergen, and some importers of U.S. wheat have a near-zero tolerance for buckwheat in grain shipments. Field studies were conducted near Pasco, WA under irrigated conditions and near Huntley, MT under dryland conditions to evaluate herbicide efficacy for buckwheat control in spring wheat. Irrigated studies included both early postemergence herbicide applications and late postemergence applications, the latter of which were applied with a sprayer designed to simulate application via chemigation. Only early postemergence herbicide treatments were evaluated in the dryland studies. With irrigation, visible control of buckwheat averaged 95% when an early postemergence herbicide application was made followed by a late postemergence herbicide application at the boot stage, but averaged 84% control when only an early postemergence application was made. No herbicide treatment eliminated buckwheat seed contamination of wheat grain from the irrigated studies. Bromoxynil + MCPA ester and fluroxypyr + bromoxynil provided superior visible control of volunteer buckwheat in dryland spring wheat in 2015 and 2016, and eliminated buckwheat seed contamination in the harvested grain in 2015. Dry conditions in 2016 prevented buckwheat seed production. The inability to eliminate buckwheat contamination in irrigated spring wheat with herbicides suggests that other approaches are needed. Foremost of these is not planting wheat for at least one or possibly two years following buckwheat harvest.

Year-Round Transpiration Dynamics Linked With Deep Soil Moisture in a Warm Desert Shrubland	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Ecohydrological processes in semiarid shrublands and other dryland ecosystems are sensitive to discrete pulses of precipitation. Anticipated changes in the frequency and magnitude of precipitation events are expected to impact the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture in these drylands, thereby impacting their ecohydrological processes. Recent field studies have shown that in dryland ecosystems, transpiration dynamics and plant productivity are largely a function of deep soil moisture available after large precipitation events, regardless of where the majority of plant roots occur. However, the strength of this relationship and how and why it varies throughout the year remains unclear. We present eddy covariance, soil moisture, and sap flow measurements taken over an 18-month period in conjunction with an analysis of biweekly precipitation, shallow soil, deep soil, and stem stable water isotope samples from a creosotebush-dominated shrubland ecosystem at the Santa Rita Experimental Range in southern Arizona. Within the context of a hydrologically defined two-layer conceptual framework, our results support that transpiration is associated with the availability of deep soil moisture and that the source of this moisture varies seasonally. Therefore, changes in precipitation pulses that alter the timing and magnitude of the availability of deep soil moisture are expected to have major consequences for dryland ecosystems. Our findings offer insights that can improve the representation of drylands within regional and global models of land surface atmosphere exchange and their linkages to the hydrologic cycle.					; Papuga, Shirley/J-7026-2013	Szutu, Daphne/0000-0001-7698-0461; Papuga, Shirley/0000-0002-7226-0640													0043-1397	1944-7973				JUL	2019	55	7					5679	5695		10.1029/2018WR023990	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018WR023990													WOS:000481444700029
J	Guan, C; Chen, N; Qiao, LJ; Zhao, CM				Guan, Chao; Chen, Ning; Qiao, Linjie; Zhao, Changming			Microbial function regulates the effect of vegetation restoration on the contribution of biocrusts to soil respiration in drylands	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												Biocrusts are special components of dryland ecosystems and play important roles in ecosystem carbon cycles. Vegetation restoration not only affects carbon storage but also changes the characteristics of biocrusts. However, how vegetation restoration influences the contribution of biocrusts to soil carbon cycling in dryland ecosystems is poorly understood.Using continuous field measurements combined with metagenomic shotgun sequencing, we explored the effect and regulatory mechanisms of Caragana korshinskii vegetation restoration on the contribution of biocrusts to total soil respiration.We found that vegetation restoration increased the contribution of biocrusts to total soil respiration, with the biocrust contribution increasing from -5.6% for mixed biocrusts in a typical steppe to 17.1%, 18.1% and 19.6% for cyanobacteria-algae, lichen and moss biocrusts, respectively, in a Caragana korshinskii vegetation restoration area. The driving factors for total soil respiration changed from solely soil temperature to soil temperature and moisture after vegetation restoration. In contrast, the driving factors for soil respiration estimated for biocrust layers changed from precipitation alone to soil temperature and precipitation after vegetation restoration. We reveal that changes in microbial functional structure play important roles in regulating the effect of vegetation restoration and biocrusts on soil respiration. In addition, vegetation restoration also increases the microbial activity in biocrusted soils.This calls for an improved understanding of the effects of biocrusts on soil respiration under vegetation restoration scenarios to advance our ability to evaluate soil carbon releases from dryland ecosystems.

A benthic invertebrates-based biotic index to assess the ecological status of West African Sahel Rivers, Burkina Faso	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Conserving aquatic resources in the West African Sahel requires water management tools to assess the ecological status of surface water bodies threatened by mounting pressures from agricultural intensification and urbanization. Macroinvertebrate communities of Sahelian rivers were examined to test if a multi-metric index approach could be developed to assess the ecological quality of rivers. A total of 40 sample sites falling within a continuum ranging from "unimpaired reference sites " to "impaired sites " were assessed during this study. Macro invertebrates were sampled with a hand net following a multi-habitat sampling approach. Key environmental parameters, both physico-chemical and hydro-morphologic, were recorded. More than 20 candidate metrics were evaluated in four categories: composition, functional feeding, diversity, and tolerance. We used detailed analysis procedures to exclude unsuitable metrics from the data set. After excluding redundant metrics, six-core metrics were selected to compose the Sahel River Multimetric Index (SRMI): Total-taxa, Shannon & Weiner index, EPTtaxa, ASPT-NEPBIOS and ASPT-SASS and Collector-filterers. The final index derived from these metrics was divided into five ecological quality classes (high, good, moderate, poor, and bad). The results showed that the SRMI responded to a set of environmental parameters associated with a gradient of human pressures affecting the ecological integrity of water bodies (R-2 & GE;|0.50|; p < 0.05; p < 0.001). This work produced a data base and analysis that confirms the usefulness of an unprecedented and promising tool for biological monitoring and decision-making in Sahelian regions' water management.

The objectives of this study were to quantify the effects of 75 years of tillage and N fertilization on macronutrients in soil and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) tissues grown in a winter wheat-summer fallow rotation. The experiment included three types of tillage (disc, DP; sweep, SW; and moldboard, MP) and five N application rates (0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 kg ha(-1)). Soil and tissue samples were analyzed for the concentration of total N, S, and C, Mehlich III extractable P, K, Mg, Ca in the soil, and the total concentration of the same nutrients in wheat tissue. Soil N concentration was significantly greater under DP (1.10 g kg(-1)) than under MP (1.03 g kg(-1)). The P concentration in upper 20 cm soil depth increased with increased N rates. Comparison of experiment plots to a nearby undisturbed pasture revealed a decline of P (32%), SOC (34%), Mg (77%), and Ca (86%) in the top 10 cm soil depth. The results suggest that DP with high N rates could reduce the macronutrient decline in soil and plant over time.

Drought as a driver of vegetation change in Succulent Karoo rangelands, South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE												We document changes in rangeland during a prolonged drought in the arid Karoo. Rangeland in this arid region is species-rich and dominated by a mixture of long-lived succulent and non-succulent shrubs. Ranching has led to the domination of vegetation by less palatable species, and resting does little to restore diversity because most species are long-lived. Between 2015 and 2020, a combination of rising temperatures and low rainfall reduced vegetation cover and grazing potential throughout the Karoo. Mortality varied among species, habitat and with predrought rangeland condition, but appeared independent of size class. Growth form was not a good predictor of drought survival, although vegetation dominated by non-succulent shrub species before the drought was dominated by a succulent shrub species toward the end of the drought. Dieback was greater on deep soil than in drainage lines and on stony rises. Historically degraded landscapes lost relatively more vegetation cover and grazing capacity than areas protected from grazing. By reducing dominant, long-lived, non-forage shrub species, drought appears to be changing the composition of the vegetation to a state that may have higher grazing potential, particularly if livestock numbers are reduced and reseeding is carried out during the recovery period.

Hence, their analysis can be used for evaluating and supporting government plans, especially conservation and management of natural habitats such as sago palm. In Papua Province of Indonesia, sago palm has been stated as one of the priority plants in the Medium-Term Development Plan (R.P.J.M.). However, limited studies have examined this palm in one of the Regencies of Papua Province, namely, Merauke Regency. In this study, we performed remotely sensed data imagery and supervised classification to produce land cover maps from 1990 to 2019. During the study period, twenty-one land cover classes were identified. The six classes of the natural forest consist of primary dryland forest, secondary dryland forest, primary mangrove forest, secondary mangrove forest, primary swamp forest, and secondary swamp forest; thus, fifteen classes of non-forested area. Concerning the sago palm habitat, our study evaluated two different categories (1) based on the land cover scheme from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry and (2) according to the peatland land cover ecosystem in Papua. Based on paired samplest-test, the result indicated statistically significant changes specifically at primary dryland (p-value = 0.015), grassland (p-value = 0.002) and swamp (p-value = 0.007). Twelve from 20 districts of Merauke Regency tend to lose the forecasted natural habitat of the sago palm. Therefore, this study suggests the further need to recognize and estimate the yield of sago palm area in these various ecosystems.

The 'desert experience': Evaluating the cultural ecosystem services of drylands through walking and focusing	PEOPLE AND NATURE												Assessment of cultural ecosystem services (CES), the non-material benefits provided to humans by nature, is a particularly challenging activity within the complex field of ecosystem service (ES) evaluation. Assessing CES of drylands presents an even greater challenge for at least two reasons. First, assessments of dryland ES are few and limited, particularly regarding CES. Second, CES evaluation methods, even qualitative ones, generally fail to provide a deep and holistic understanding of the dynamic relationship between nature experiences, culture and identity. The current study uses a novel methodology to evaluate CES in a dryland ecosystem: walking-focusing interviews. In these interviews, participants are encouraged to focus on various aspects of their physical, mental and cognitive experiences as they walked in a natural desert landscape. The interview protocol enabled us to capture a wealth of knowledge regarding people's desert experiences. Findings indicate that geological phenomena and other abiotic elements of desert landscapes rank high among participants' reported dryland CES, which inspire complex and multi-level experiences. Other prominent themes that emerged included imagination, relaxation, wind and quiet. As deserts are low in primary productivity and therefore display less conspicuous biological elements, the protocol was found to be particularly effective for addressing both their living and non-living CES. The methodology of walking-focusing interviews is shown to be able to extract information pertaining to people's holistic experience of nature, which suggests that it is a powerful methodology for CES assessments of landscapes in general.

However, browse species have anti-nutritional factors, such as polyphenols. This study evaluated the extent to which polyethylene glycol (PEG) can reduce the anti-nutritional effects of polyphenols whose extent is expected to vary depending on the species type and season on the in vitro fermentation of these plant samples. We selected ten browse species commonly used as livestock feed based on their tannin content, and sixty samples of the leaf and twig of these species were collected during the wet and dry seasons. The study was designed as 10 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with 10 browse species (Acacia nilotica, Crateva adonsonia, Dombeya torrida, Ekebergia capensis, Ensete ventricosum, Erythrina brucei, Maesa lanceolate, Sesbania sesban, Stereospermum kunthianum, and Terminalia laxiflora), 2 seasons (wet and dry) and 2 states of PEG (with and without PEG). The effects of tannin on the nutritive characteristics were also evaluated by adding PEG as a tannin-binding agent. The chemical composition and in vitro fermentation products of these samples differed significantly (p < 0.001) among browse species. Specifically, total extractable phenol (TEP) ranged from 26.3 to 250.3 g/kg, total extractable tannin (TET) from 22.8 to 210.9 g/kg, and condensed tannin (CT) from 11.1 to 141.3 g/kg, respectively. Season, species, and their interaction have a significant (p < 0.05) effect on the chemical composition and fermentation characteristics of most browse species. The addition of PEG increased gas production (GP), in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD), metabolizable energy (ME) concentration, dry matter degradability (DMD), and volatile fatty acids (VFA), on average, by 76.8%, 47.9%, 42.2%, 21.2%, and 20.2%, respectively. Secondary polyphenols (TEP, TET, CT, and SCT) were significantly (p < 0.001) and negatively correlated with GP, IVOMD, ME, and VFA. Preferable species namely E. ventricosum, S. sesban, M. lanceolata, E. capensis, and A. nilotica were selected for supplementation in terms of their chemical composition, IVOMD, and mitigating effects of PEG on anti-nutritional functions of their secondary compounds. In conclusion, PEG markedly reduced the anti-nutritional effects of polyphenols and improved the in vitro fermentation of browse species harvested in contrasting seasons.

J	McDonough, KN				McDonough, Katelyn N.			Middle Holocene menus: dietary reconstruction from coprolites at the Connley Caves, Oregon, USA	ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Multiproxy data from coprolites at the Connley Caves in central Oregon provide new evidence for diet, seasonal subsistence strategies, and human health during the middle and late Holocene. Macrobotanical, palynological, and faunal components show that plant taxa from wetland and dryland habitats functioned as dietary staples. Repeated and abundant representation of wetland resources coupled with small dryland seeds provide strong evidence for dietary continuity between similar to 5700 and 3200 calendar years ago. Seasonal availability of represented taxa indicates late summer and early fall habitation. Minimal evidence for parasitic infection and unusual constituents such as cordage raise questions regarding health and cultural behavior. As the first coprolite analysis for this time period in the northern Great Basin, this study contributes unique datasets that complement and clarify the regional understanding of hunter-gatherer settlement-subsistence strategies and food economy.

Balancing socioeconomic development with ecological conservation towards rural sustainability: a case study in semiarid rural China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY												Despite the dramatic progress in poverty reduction, China's vast rural areas of backwardness, environmental degradation and low labour productivity are a long-standing challenge to achieve common prosperity and sustainable development. Finding a balance between ecological conservation and socioeconomic development is a solution. However, previous studies have largely neglected the concept. Here, we proposed a framework that integrates the ecological environment and socioeconomic wellbeing via farm management and the use of ecosystem services (ES) to assess rural sustainability and explore a suitable balance and pathways from the perspective of the human dimension. Taking Yan'he Township in China's Loess Plateau as an example, a clustering analysis was performed to group farm households based on their behaviour in cropping, land rental, and off-farm work. A composite index was built to assess rural sustainability at the farm household level, while a structural equation model was performed to estimate the effect of land-use practices on rural sustainability and explore adequate farm management and policy interventions. The results show that households with different farm management and land-use strategies had divergent agricultural performance, use of ES, and environmental and wellbeing outcomes. Increasing legume cropping with conservation approaches (e.g., rotation) and extended irrigation while encouraging migrant work with ensured equal urban-rural social welfare and property rights may contribute to balancing socioeconomic development with ecological conservation. The findings indicate that both interventionist policies and independent market support are vital for individual and community capacity building and public infrastructure development to stimulate agricultural adaptation and rural transformation towards sustainability.

RESEARCH ON THE RUNOFF OF ARID DESERT GRASSLANDS UNDER CHANGING ENVIRONMENTS IN CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Reasonable allocation of water resources in dryland pastures plays a decisive role in local ecological protection and economic development. Changes in the local climate and vegetation have a direct impact on the local runoff. With Darhan Muminggan Joint Banner (DM Banner) as the study area in China, we made use of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model, calibrated and fitted the parameters into the model according to the local meteorological statistics and data on land utilization, soil texture and runoff. After fitting and calibration, we built a SWAT model for arid desert grasslands to simulate and forecast re-distribution of water resources in the study area under changes in the climate and vegetation. This study is expected to provide technical support for reasonable development and utilization of water resources in dryland pastures as well as ecological recovery in Inner Mongolia of China.

However, the controlling factors of the net N-min rate and its Q(10) at the regional scale remain highly uncertain, especially in different ecosystem types.Methods An incubation experiment at three different temperatures was conducted to measure the net N-min rate and to calculate its Q(10). High-throughput sequencing was applied to explore the microbial community diversity and composition.Results Results showed that the overall net N-min rate was highest in paddy fields, followed by forest and dryland fields, whereas its Q(10) was not different among ecosystems. Structural equation models revealed that the net N-min rate was mainly affected by soil properties in dryland habitats, whereas it was mainly influenced by soil microbial communities and mean annual temperature (MAT) in paddy habitats. In forest habitats, the net N-min rate was mainly affected by bacterial communities rather than fungal communities. The Q(10) of net N-min was close to 2.0, indicating that the net N-min rate is sensitive to climatic warming. The Q(10) was impacted by the bacterial community composition in dryland soils, whereas it was influenced by soil properties and bacterial diversity in paddy and forest soils.Conclusion This study provides a novel quantification on the contribution of soil microbial diversity and community composition to soil net N-min process in three ecosystem types, with implications for microbial-mediated N mineralization process under climatic change scenarios.					罗, 雪松/JAO-5524-2023; Huang, Qiaoyun/A-8418-2012	Huang, Qiaoyun/0000-0002-2733-8066													0032-079X	1573-5036				2022 DEC 21	2022										10.1007/s11104-022-05843-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-022-05843-1		DEC 2022											WOS:000899847300001

It was located on an alluvial plain along the Yangtze River in the Yichang section. The region around the site comprised mountains, hills, and plains, which was a compatible environment for the cultivation of various crops. Previous studies have suggested that the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are one of the most productive regions for rice cultivation. Besides rice, however, seven dryland crops have been found at the Wanfunao site: foxtail millet, broomcorn millet, wheat, barley, oat, buckwheat, and adzuki bean. Among them, foxtail millet and rice are most ubiquitous. The crop assemblage has revealed that the northern dryland crops, including those were newly adapted cereals such as foxtail millet, wheat, and barley, gradually dispersed southward and became a part of the diet along with rice. This can be attributed to southern Chinese inhabitants' reclamation of the hilly environment for agriculture. Although communities in southern China had cultivated rice on the plains for thousands of years, newly introduced dryland crops from north China adapted to mountainous environments better. The development of multi-cropping systems in southern China likely involved changes in agricultural ontology associated with the adaptation of northern crops in southern environments newly encountered. Additionally, the assemblage of foxtail millet grain/rice spikelet base in the site may have been used for livestock feeding. A wide range of landforms, compatible farming, and surplus agricultural products for husbandry may have been a part of the economic foundation that facilitated the rise of Chu.

Implementing integrated management practices such as host resistance and fungicides can be used to manage FHB and the associated mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON). However, depending on the production year in North Dakota, both management tools might not be needed for FHB. The objective of this research was to evaluate fungicide premixes and varietal resistance on suppression of FHB, suppression of DON, and economic response in diverse FHB environments in dryland HRSW. Seven field experiments were conducted at dryland locations from 2019 to 2021. Two HRSW varieties, WB-Mayville (susceptible) and ND-VitPro (moderately resistant) served as the main plots, and seven fungicide treatments, including a nontreated control, served as the subplots. Based on disease levels and local weather data (relative humidity, rainfall, and temperature), field experiments were categorized into four FHB management environments (high, moderate, low, and no disease) to assess the effectiveness of management tools in field situations faced by HRSW growers. The fungicide premixture treatments of metconazole + prothioconazole and pydiflumetofen + propiconazole provided similar or better suppression of FHB and DON when compared with FHB fungicide standards. The results suggest that the use of fungicides on a moderately resistant variety provided a more favorable economic response when compared with their use on a susceptible variety in moderate and low FHB environments. The results from this study will help guide FHB management decisions in dryland HRSW.

Understanding the distribution, transportation, and sources of nitrogen is the premise for effective pollution control in the catchment. The present study used the nitrogen and oxygen isotopes technique to explore the dynamic changes and sources of nitrates during rainfall in various land uses in a typical karst catchment in southwestern China. The results of hydrochemistry composition indicated that agricultural activities have caused the deterioration of water quality, while intensive rainfall during the wet season has played a positive role in promoting it. NO3--N was the major inorganic N, accounting for 78.7 & PLUSMN; 21.6% (N = 38) of the total nitrogen. Dryland and paddy field provided a large amount of nitrogen for the water environment by rain, which contributed to high NO3--N concentration in spring (6.1 & PLUSMN; 0.9 mg/L) and runoff (7.2 & PLUSMN; 0.9 mg/L) at the catchment outlet. Nitrate isotopic compositions (& delta;N-15-NO3- and & delta;O-18-NO3-) and water isotopes (& delta;D and & delta;O-18-H2O) revealed that isotopic composition in dryland and paddy field was mainly affected by nitrification. Source analysis showed that dryland and paddy field was dominated by chemical fertilizers and manure, while precipitation and soil organic nitrogen were the major sources in abandoned land, forest and shrub. This study highlighted that land management and nitrogen fertilizer application should be reasonable to reduce the risk of nitrogen surplus in the water environment.																			1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2023	82	13							332	10.1007/s12665-023-10980-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-023-10980-6													WOS:001012465300004

Management of pigweed (<i>Amaranthus</i> spp.) in grain sorghum with integrated strategies	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Pigweed is difficult to manage in grain sorghum because of widespread herbicide resistance, a limited number of registered effective herbicides, and the synchronous emergence of pigweed with grain sorghum in Kansas. The combination of cultural and mechanical control tactics with an herbicide program are commonly recognized as best management strategies; however, limited information is available to adapt these strategies to dryland systems. Our objective for this research was to assess the influence of four components, including a winter wheat cover crop (CC), row-crop cultivation, three row widths, with and without a herbicide program, on pigweed control in a dryland system. Field trials were implemented during 2017 and 2018 at three locations for a total of 6 site-years. The herbicide program component resulted in excellent control (>97%) in all treatments at 3 and 8 weeks after planting (WAP). CC provided approximately 50% reductions in pigweed density and biomass for both timings in half of the site-years; however, mixed results were observed in the remaining site-years, ranging from no attributable difference to a 170% increase in weed density at 8 WAP in 1 site-year. Treatments including row-crop cultivation reduced pigweed biomass and density in most site-years 3 and 8 WAP. An herbicide program is required to achieve pigweed control and should be integrated with row-crop cultivation or narrow row widths to reduce the risk of herbicide resistance. Additional research is required to optimize the use of CC as an integrated pigweed management strategy in dryland grain sorghum.																			0890-037X	1550-2740				OCT	2019	33	5					701	709		10.1017/wet.2019.64	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/wet.2019.64													WOS:000491469400008
J	Groom, B; Palmer, C; Sileci, L				Groom, Ben; Palmer, Charles; Sileci, Lorenzo			Carbon emissions reductions from Indonesia's moratorium on forest concessions are cost-effective yet contribute little to Paris pledges	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												International initiatives for reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) could make critical, cost-effective contributions to tropical countries' nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Norway, a key donor of such initiatives, had a REDD+ partnership with Indonesia, offering results-based payments in exchange for emissions reductions calculated against a historical baseline. Central to this partnership was an area-based moratorium on new oil palm, timber, and logging concessions in primary and peatland forests. We evaluate the effectiveness of the moratorium between 2011 and 2018 by applying a matched triple difference strategy to a unique panel dataset. Treated dryland forest inside moratorium areas retained, at most, an average of 0.65% higher forest cover compared to untreated dryland forest outside the moratorium. By contrast, carbon-rich peatland forest was unaffected by the moratorium. Cumulative avoided dryland deforestation from 2011 until 2018 translates into 67.8 million to 86.9 million tons of emissions reductions, implying an effective carbon price below Norway's US$5 per ton price. Based on Norway's price, our estimated cumulative emissions reductions are equivalent to a payment of US$339 million to US$434.5 million. Annually, our estimates suggest a 3 to 4% contribution to Indonesia's NDC commitment of a 29% emissions reduction by 2030. Despite the Indonesia-Norway partnership ending in 2021, reducing emissions from deforestation remains critical for meeting this commitment. Future area-based REDD+ initiatives could build on the moratorium's outcomes by reforming its incentives and institutional arrangements, particularly in peatland forest areas.

Any negative impacts of climate change on foliar nutrient contents would be expected to negatively affect the photosynthetic capacity, water use efficiency and overall fitness of dryland vegetation. We conducted a 4-year manipulative experiment using open top chambers and rainout shelters to assess the impacts of warming (similar to 2 degrees C, W), rainfall reduction (similar to 30%, RR) and their combination (W + RR) on the nutrient status and ecophysiological performance of six native shrub species of contrasting phylogeny in a semi-arid ecosystem. Leaf nutrient status and gas exchange were assessed yearly, whereas biomass production and survival were measured at the end of the study. Warming (W and W + RR) advanced shoot growth phenology and reduced foliar macro- (N, P, K) and micronutrient (Cu, Fe, Zn) concentrations (by 8%-18% and 14%-56% respectively), net photosynthetic rate (32%), above-ground biomass production (28%-39%) and survival (23%-46%). Decreased photosynthesis and growth in W and W + RR plants were primarily linked to enhanced nutritional constraints on carbon fixation. Poor leaf nutrient status in W and W + RR plants partly decoupled carbon assimilation from water flux and led to drastic reductions in water use efficiency (WUEi; similar to 41%) across species. The RR treatment moderately decreased foliar macro- and micronutrients (6%-17%, except for Zn) and biomass production (22%). The interactive impacts of warming and rainfall reduction (W + RR treatment) on plant performance were generally smaller than expected from additive single-factor effects. Synthesis. Large decreases in plant nutrient pool size and productivity combined with increased mortality during hotter droughts will reduce vegetation cover and nutrient retention capacity, thereby disrupting biogeochemical processes and accelerating dryland degradation with impending climate change. Increased macro- and micronutrient co-limitation of photosynthesis with forecasted climate change conditions may offset any gains in WUEi and productivity derived from anthropogenic CO2 elevation, thereby increasing dryland vegetation vulnerability to drought stress in a warmer and drier climate. The generalized reduction in leaf nutrient contents with warming compromises plant nutritional quality for herbivores, with potential cascading negative effects across trophic levels.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi represent an important route for plant-derived C into soil and can be influenced by agricultural practices. Whether the changes of AM fungal community affect soil organic C sequestration is a fundamental question in semiarid environments. To this end, we conducted two field experiments investigating the influence of aFunneliformis mosseaeinoculation and mycorrhizal-suppression using benomyl application on maize growth, soil fractions of organic C, AM fungal parameters, including diversity profiling using the Illumina MiSeq. The results showed that AM fungal community composition was significantly altered by plastic film mulching and fungicide applications, soil organic C fractions and nitrogen were most important factors in influencing the AM fungal community. AM fungal inoculation significantly increased particulate organic C and light fraction organic C content, due to enhance dextramatrical hyphal length (EMH), glomalin content, and root biomass. Conversely, fungicide applications reduced labile organic C, possibly through decreasing EMH, glomalin content and soil AM fungal diversity. Increases in relative abundance ofF. mosseaein rhizosphere soil, coupled with increases in AM fungal root colonization fromF. mosseaeinoculation indicates successfully established by outcompeting the existing natural AM fungal community. Plastic film mulching resulted in significant increases in maize yield and water use efficiency, and AM fungal inoculation was found to amplify the effects. Thus, AM fungal inoculation may act as an effective farming practice to improve soil organic C fractions, which can boost maize productivity.

This information is important for ecological protection, carbon accounting, climate mitigation and restoration efforts of dryland ecosystems(15-18). We assessed more than 9.9 billion trees derived from more than 300,000 satellite images, covering semi-arid sub-Saharan Africa north of the Equator. We attributed wood, foliage and root carbon to every tree in the 0-1,000 mm year(-1) rainfall zone by coupling field data(19), machine learning(20-22), satellite data and high-performance computing. Average carbon stocks of individual trees ranged from 0.54 Mg C ha(-1) and 63 kg C tree(-1) in the arid zone to 3.7 Mg C ha(-1) and 98 kg tree(-1) in the sub-humid zone. Overall, we estimated the total carbon for our study area to be 0.84 (& PLUSMN;19.8%) Pg C. Comparisons with 14 previous TRENDY numerical simulation studies(23) for our area found that the density and carbon stocks of scattered trees have been underestimated by three models and overestimated by 11 models, respectively.

As China attaches increasing importance to environmental protection, many regions are trying to reduce water pollution through land use changes. The long-term variations of the nonpoint source (NPS) pollution affected by land use changes in the DLRB have not been previously assessed. In this study, the contributions of land use/land cover (LULC) changes in 1980-2015 to NPS pollution were evaluated by comparing simulations under paired land use scenarios using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The historical trend and ecological protection scenarios in 2025 were established based on CA-Markov model, and pollution loads in both scenarios were forecasted. Results show that the expansion of dryland and urban areas and the decline in forest and grassland coverage were the major contributors to the increase in NPS pollution in the DLRB. The expansion of paddy field resulted in an increase in actual total phosphorus (TP) but a decrease in total nitrogen (TN). In the historical trend scenario, dryland would decrease by 4.57%. TN and TP loads were 1.40% and 1.45% lower than those in 2015, respectively. In the ecological protection scenario, TN and TP loads were 3.37% and 6.11% lower than those in 2015, respectively, due to the decreased area of dryland by 7.22%. Pollutions in the riverside and southeast areas of the basin would be reduced in 2025. This finding shows that NPS pollution is controlled under the current policy.

Nonetheless, future climate conditions in Northwest China still remain uncertain. In this study, we applied an ensemble of the 12 latest model simulations of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) to assess future drought conditions until 2099 in Northwest China, as inferred from the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). Future drought conditions were projected under three climate change scenarios through the combination of shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) and representative concentration pathways (RCPs), namely, SSP126 (SSP1 + RCP2.6, a green development pathway), SSP245 (SSP2 + RCP4.5, an intermediate development pathway), and SSP585 (SSP5 + RCP8.5, a high development pathway). For 2015-2099, drought severity showed no trend under SSP126, in contrast, for the SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, a rapid increase during 2015-2099 was observed, especially under SSP585. We also found that the drought frequency in Northwest China under SSP585 was generally lower than that under SSP126 and SSP245, although the drought duration under SSP585 tended to be longer. These findings suggest the green development pathway in drought mitigation and adaptation strategies in Northwest China, an arid and agricultural region along the Silk Road.

However, the relative impacts of VPD and SMC on LUE are unclear, as we lack a mechanistic understanding of impacts and their interactions. In this study, we quantified the relative roles of VPD and SMC in limiting LUE and analysed the interactions among VPD, SMC and LUE using data from CO2 and water flux stations and weather stations along a climatic gradient in the Heihe River Basin, China. We found a threshold of VPD constraint on LUE; above the threshold, LUE decreased at only 3.6% to 23.1% of the rate below the threshold. As SMC decreased, however, the VPD threshold increased, and the reduction of LUE caused by VPD decreased significantly, which is more than half of that in moister regions. Therefore, both VPD and SMC played essential roles in LUE limitation caused by water stress. A threshold also existed for heat flux and the correlation between SMC and LUE; the strength of the correlation first decreased and then increased with increasing VPD. Our results clarified the relative impacts of VPD and SMC on LUE, and can improve simulation and prediction of plant productivity.

We determined the effects of these land uses on soil physical properties, and water release characteristics, on adjacent sites: a centre-pivot sprinkler-irrigated dairy farm site, a dryland sheep site, and a non-grazed, non-irrigated control site. Despite the Pallic Soil being well drained, greater soil compaction occurred at the dairy site than at other sites, to at least 30 cm depth. The dairy site typically had significantly lower total porosity and macroporosity, and greater bulk density and volumetric water content, than the other sites. Available water capacity varied but was greater at the dairy site (0-30 cm) than at the sheep site and control site. Further research is required across more farms and soils to confirm these results in other conditions.

Climate change and other anthropogenic disturbances are thought to cause a decline in mosses and lichens, yet few long-term studies exist to track potential shifts in these sensitive soil-surface communities. Using a unique long-term observational dataset from a temperate dryland with initial observations dating back to 1967, we examine the effects of 53 y of observed environmental variation and Bromus tectorum invasion on biocrust communities in a grassland never grazed by domestic livestock. Annual observations show a steep decline in N-fixing lichen cover (dominated by Collema species) from 1996 to 2002, coinciding with a period of extended drought, with Collema communities never able to recover. Declines in other lichen species were also observed, both in number of species present and by total cover, which were attributed to increasing summertime temperatures. Conversely, moss species gradually gained in cover over the survey years, especially following a large Bromus tectorum invasion at the study onset (ca. 1996 to 2001). These results support a growing body of studies that suggests climate change is a key driver in changes to certain components of late-successional biocrust communities. Results here suggest that warming may partially negate decades of protection from disturbance, with biocrust communities reaching a vital tipping point. The accelerated rate of ongoing warming observed in this study may have resulted in the loss of lichen cover and diversity, which could have long-term implications for global temperate dryland ecosystems.

Effects of sowing methods and nitrogen rates on photosynthetic characteristics, yield, and quality of winter wheat	PHOTOSYNTHETICA												Sustainability of winter wheat yield under dryland conditions depends on improvements in crop photosynthetic characteristics and crop yield. Therefore, studying the effects of different sowing methods and nitrogen rates on photosynthetic characteristics of flag leaves, nitrogen translocation, and yield could be an effective strategy to improve the crop yield. In this study, four nitrogen application concentrations and two sowing methods were used. The results showed that the photosynthetic rates were the highest at different stages of wide-space sowing (WSS) after flowering. Nitrogen concentration of 240 kg ha(-1) improved the photosynthetic characteristics and significantly increased the net photosynthesis, stomata! conductance. and transpiration rate after flowering and significantly reduced the intercellular CO2 concentration compaired to other nitrogen concentrations. Our overall findings suggested that WSS nitrogen treatment with 240 kg ha(-1) enhanced photosynthetic characteristics of flag leaves and nitrogen content of the plants leading to high yield under dryland conditions.

Hydrology and pool morphology shape the trophic base of macroinvertebrate assemblages in ephemeral stream pools	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Intermittent and ephemeral streams in dryland regions often fragment into isolated pools as they dry. In general, pool fragmentation provides favorable conditions for aquatic algae and plant growth and should therefore result in foodweb reliance on aquatic algal resources over comparatively-recalcitrant terrestrial plant litter. However, differences in pool hydrology and morphology might substantially alter organic matter dynamics and, thus, alter the trophic base of aquatic consumers. We tested whether 1) taxa composition or 2) pool hydrology and morphology might affect the trophic base of macroinvertebrate assemblages in dryland stream pools. We used stable isotope analysis to assess the hydrological regime (delta O-18 and delta H-2) and trophic structure (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of fragmented pools within an ephemeral dryland stream. We compared differences in pool morphology, evaporation rates, and groundwater connectivity to dietary-mixing model results for macroinvertebrate assemblages over 2 seasons. Differences in macroinvertebrate assemblage composition were not consistently related to pool hydrology, morphology, or season. We found that filamentous algae and aquatic biofilms supported macroinvertebrate assemblages to a greater extent than did terrestrial plant litter. Biofilm assimilation was higher in highly-evaporated pools, and terrestrial plant litter assimilation decreased as pools became smaller and aquatic vegetation cover decreased. Overall trophic diversity decreased with increasing aquatic vegetation cover. This study suggests that hydrological and morphological gradients across pools drive differences in the trophic base of macroinvertebrate assemblages, potentially through variation in organic matter productivity and biomass. Consequently, natural variability in groundwater connectivity and pool morphology likely enhances trophic diversity across this ephemeral riverscape.

Growing dryland crops can effectively decrease the demand for irrigation water. However, the previous works on annual crop planning (ACP) focused on maximizing the profit through growing wetland crops and consuming much water. For sustainability, in this article, we propose a mathematical programming model for an ACP that allocates a land area for growing dryland and wetland crops to maximize the total profit and minimize the total irrigation water used for multiple cropping, under practical constraints. The simplified swarm optimization (SSO) improves the particle swarm optimization with four probabilities to determine the operations of updating solutions. We further propose dynamic SSO (DSSO) to solve the concerned ACP in which the four probabilities are adjusted dynamically according to the performance of the operations executed. Through simulation on a case study, the proposed DSSO demonstrates high performance over some classical approaches.

This study analyses heat impacts on wheat using daily weather information and a dryland wheat dataset for 71 cultivars across 17 locations in South Africa from 1998 to 2014. We estimate temperature impacts on yields in extensive regression models, finding that extreme heat drives wheat yield losses, with an additional 24 h of exposure to temperatures above 30 degrees C associated with a 12.5% yield reduction. Results from a uniform warming scenario of +1 degrees C show an average wheat yield reduction of 8.5%, which increases to 18.4% and 28.5% under +2 and +3 degrees C scenarios. We also find evidence of differences in heat effects across cultivars, which suggests warming impacts may be reduced through the sharing of gene pools amongst wheat breeding programs.

Through their access to organic N, ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi compete with free-living soil microbes; this competition is thought to slow down SOM decomposition. However, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi cannot decompose SOM, and therefore must wait for N to first be processed by free-living microbes. It is unclear what form of N the ECM fungi and free-living microbes compete for, or which microbial groups compete for N with ECM fungi. To investigate this, we focused on the N transformation steps (i.e., the degradation of high-molecular-weight organic matter, mineralization, and nitrification) and the microbes driving each step. Simple comparisons between AM forests and ECM forests are not sufficient to assert that mycorrhizal types would determine the N transformation steps in soil, because soil physiochemistry, which strongly affects N transformation steps, differs between the forests. We used an aridity gradient with large differences in soil moisture, pH, and SOM quantity and quality, to distinguish the mycorrhizal and physicochemical effects on N transformation. Soil samples (0-10 cm depth) were collected from AM-symbiotic black locust forests under three aridity levels, and from ECM-symbiotic oak forests under two aridity levels. Soil physicochemical properties, extractable N dynamics and abundance, composition, and function of soil microbial communities were measured. In ECM forests, the ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotic abundance was low, whereas that of ECM fungi was high, resulting in lower nitrate N content than in AM forests. Since ECM forests did not have lower saprotrophic fungal abundance and prokaryotic decompositional activity than the AM forests, the hypothesis that ECM fungi could reduce SOM decay and ammonification by free-living microbes, might not hold in ECM forests. However, the limitation of ECM fungi on nitrate N production would result in a feedback that will accelerate plant dependence on these fungi, thereby raising soil C storage through an increase in the ECM biomass and plant C investment in soils.					taniguchi, takeshi/AAG-5450-2021; DU, SHENG/A-7528-2008; Taniguchi, Takeshi/C-9364-2019; Norikazu, Yamanaka/D-4628-2019	taniguchi, takeshi/0000-0001-7386-1117; DU, SHENG/0000-0002-5580-399X; Yamanaka, Norikazu/0000-0003-4997-4060; Tatsumi, Chikae/0000-0001-7191-6049; Tateno, Ryunosuke/0000-0001-8461-3696													0012-9658	1939-9170				MAR	2020	101	3								10.1002/ecy.2963	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2963		JAN 2020						31872432					WOS:000508801700001

Land desertification may influence soil microplastics' abundance, transport, and distribution, but their distribution in the dryland deserts of Central Asia's Amu Darya-Aral Sea basin is unknown. Here, we investigated the abundance and distribution of microplastics in dryland desert soils from the Amu Darya River to the Aral Sea basin in Central Asia at a spatial scale of 1000 km and soil depths ranging from 0 to 50 cm. Microplastics were found in soils from all sample locations, with abundances ranging from 182 to 17841 items kg-1 and a median of 3369. Twenty-four polymers were identified, with polyurethane (PU, 37.3%), silicone resin (SR, 17.0%), and chlorinated polyethylene (CPE, 9.8%) accounting for 64.1% of all polymer types. The abundance of microplastics was significantly higher in deep (20-50 cm) soils than in surface (0-5, 5-20 cm) soils. The main morphological characteristics of the observed microplastics were small size (20-50 mu m) and irregular particles with no round edges (mean eccentricity 0.65). The abundance was significantly and positively related to soil EC and TP. According to the findings, desertification processes increase the abundance of microplastic particles in soils and promote migration to deeper soil layers. Human activities, mainly grazing, may be the region's primary cause of desertification and microplastic pollution. Our findings provide new information on the diffusion of microplastics in drylands during desertification; these findings are critical for understanding and promoting dryland plastic pollution prevention and control.

The international nature conservation union defines the drylands as the regions with water shortage that might have limited precipitation or rainfalls for a short period of time. According to the climatic conditions and the daily increasing interventions of human beings in the ecosystems; and, considering the unbridled expansion of the cities, aridity and desertification and the grounds of its emergence, i.e. dry and arid lands, and the way the human beings treat it has become a hot topic of the day and a major concern of the landscape architects and theoreticians and environment supporters. However, the thing that has been so far carried out is the interpretation and evaluation of these grounds within the framework of a solely climatic and occasionally ecologic subject wherein the role of the human beings as the addressee influencing and influenced by it has been ignored or underestimated. The present study uses a qualitative method based on logical reasoning through library research to review the related literature on the subject within the area of the landscape perception process and seeks to offer a landscape-based mindset and showcase the objective-subjective potentials of the dry grounds within the format of arid landscapes. To do so, use has been made herein of an objective theory within the format of "visual lands" and a subjective theory within the framework of the ideation by Jacobs (2006) in order to reach answers for the study questions due to the fact that there are specified and codified indices available for evaluating landscape. The evaluation and analysis of the visual and mental indices of the drylands in these two formats is reflective of the idea that there is compatibility with the intended indices in the evaluation of the physical and biological indicators of the dry grounds, including morphology, vegetative cover, texture and color, and that these natural grounds can be realized as transcending beyond the solely climatic and environmental framework and grant them a landscape identity.

They could potentially be used to restore degraded dryland soils, but in sandy deserts, few cases of successful restoration have been reported. In this study, we investigated the growth-promoting effects of exogenous additives on moss biocrusts on sandy soils and their potential underlying mechanisms.MethodsA field-based study was used to examine the effects of inoculation by bacteria (Actinomyces bovis, Bacillus megaterium) and algae (Chlorella vulgaris, Microcoleus vaginatus), bound with Artemisia sphaerocephala gum, on the growth of mosses on a sandy soil. We used 16S and 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing and microbial co-occurrence ecological network analysis to examine the structure and interaction of the microbial community under the best performing inoculation treatment in different moss development stages.ResultsThe addition of exogenous microorganisms promoted moss biocrust growth. The best inoculation treatment was achieved with the addition of Actinomyces bovis and Chlorella vulgaris, which resulted in greater moss cover, height and density than the control. The addition of exogenous microorganisms improved microbial richness and diversity, and altered soil microbial community structure and assemblage, such as increasing the relative abundance of Streptophyta, which was associated with greater moss biocrust growth. Moreover, exogenous microorganisms strengthened the interactions among microbes and microbial community stability, and accelerated the degradation of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN).ConclusionsOur findings reveal the growth-promoting mechanisms of microbial inoculation, which could provide a cost-effective method of restoring moss biocrusts in sandy deserts, offering new perspectives for dryland ecological restoration.					sun, chen/JCP-0396-2023	Bu, Chongfeng/0000-0002-5839-7229													0032-079X	1573-5036				OCT	2023	491	1-2			SI		421	437		10.1007/s11104-023-06124-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-023-06124-1		JUL 2023											WOS:001017797100001

Several studies have examined system design, soil fertility management and system interactions, but the biodiversity and mitigation aspects of climate change have received less focus. We assessed the diversity of woody species, biomass carbon (C), and soil organic carbon (SOC) stock associated with indigenous dryland AF practices. A total of 197 smallholder farmers representing four AF practices (home garden, parkland, boundary plantation, and woodlot) from lowland, midland, and highland areas were systematically selected. The inventory of woody species was carried out on each farm's randomly formed plot. Results We identified a total of 59 woody species representing 48 genera and 32 families. Shannon diversity index (H') was highest in home garden and parkland AF, while woodlots had the highest mean total stock of biomass C (31 Mg C ha(-1)). C stocks for smallholding systems (total biomass C and SOC 0-60 cm) ranged from 77-135 Mg ha(-1). Total biomass C stocks were significantly correlated with abundance (Spearman r = 0.333; p = 0.002) but biomass components were not significantly correlated with H'. SOC soil depth stock (0-60 cm) was positively and significantly associated with H' (Spearman r = 0.291 & 0.351; p < 0.01). Conclusions We report greater species richness in home garden and parkland AF systems than in woodlots. While parkland AF produce lower biomass and SOC stock relative to other AF systems. The strategic use of home gardens and boundary planting can improve tree diversity and carbon storage in Ethiopian dryland ecosystems.

J	Jia, RL; Chen, N; Yu, KL; Zhao, CM				Jia, Rongliang; Chen, Ning; Yu, Kailiang; Zhao, Changming			High rainfall frequency promotes the dominance of biocrust under low annual rainfall	PLANT AND SOIL												AimsGlobal climate change may greatly alter the structure and stability of drylands, creating an urgent need to recover their functions and services. Biological soil crust (biocrust), an interface between the soil and atmosphere, plays a crucial role in ecohydrological processes, and thus in influencing the restoration dynamics of dryland ecosystems. Previous studies have generally investigated the influences of biocrust on ecohydrological processes as an exogenous factor. However, it remains unclear how biocrusts, as an integral part of many ecosystems (i.e., as a system state variable), will change under global climate change.MethodsThis study developed a new ecohydrological model with biocrust cover as a system state variable, and explored the response of dryland ecosystems to altered rainfall regimes.ResultsBiocrust cover responded with an inverted U-shaped curve relationship to increasing annual rainfall and linearly to increasing rainfall frequency. Vascular plant (grass and shrub) cover showed an increasing trend with increasing annual rainfall and a decreasing trend to increasing rainfall frequency. Therefore, biocrust usually dominated over vascular plants (i.e., high biocrust cover and low vascular plant cover) under low annual rainfall. Furthermore, an increasing rainfall frequency would amplify the range of environmental (rainfall) conditions dominated by biocrust from an annual rainfall 0-100mm under a rainfall frequency of 0.025day(-1) to 0-500mm under a rainfall frequency of 1day(-1).ConclusionsThis study developed a model framework to predict dryland dynamics for surfaces covered by biocrust under global climate change. We suggest that restoration efforts could target at biocrust-dominated state in deserts, especially in a (future) drier climate.

Knowledge of the spatial distribution of. crit is crucial for future projections of climate and water resources. Here, we use global eddy covariance observations to quantify.crit and evaporative fraction (EF) regimes. Three canonical variables describe how EF is controlled by SM: the maximum EF (EFmax), theta(crit), and slope (S) between EF and SM. We find systematic differences of these three variables across biomes. Variation in theta(crit), S, and EFmax is mostly explained by soil texture, vapor pressure deficit, and precipitation, respectively, as well as vegetation structure. Dryland ecosystems tend to operate at low theta(crit) and show adaptation to water deficits. The negative relationship between theta(crit) and S indicates that dryland ecosystems minimize.crit through mechanisms of sustained SM extraction and transport by xylem. Our results further suggest an optimal adaptation of local EF-SM response that maximizes growing-season evapotranspiration and photosynthesis.

However, the influence of land-atmosphere feedbacks on future P-E changes and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that soil moisture (SM) strongly impacts future P-E changes, especially in drylands, by regulating evapotranspiration and atmospheric moisture inflow. Using modelling and empirical approaches, we find a consistent negative SM feedback on P-E, which may offset similar to 60% of the decline in dryland P-E otherwise expected in the absence of SM feedbacks. The negative feedback is not caused by atmospheric thermodynamic responses to declining SM; rather, reduced SM, in addition to limiting evapotranspiration, regulates atmospheric circulation and vertical ascent to enhance moisture transport into drylands. This SM effect is a large source of uncertainty in projected dryland P-E changes, underscoring the need to better constrain future SM changes and improve the representation of SM-atmosphere processes in models.

Fe deficiency can limit plant production and cause anaemia in humans. The improvement of Fe homoeostasis could resolve both problems. Fe homoeostasis in Aegilops tauschii, the D genome donor of bread wheat, is not fully understood. Here, we analysed physiological traits in 42 accessions of Ae. tauschii associated with Fe homoeostasis, i.e. mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs), phenylamides, SPAD values and metal concentrations. All traits showed diversity, suggesting the presence of candidate genes in the Ae. tauschii accessions, which could improve Fe homoeostasis in bread wheat. All accessions mainly produced and secreted mainly 2 '-deoxymugineic acid among MAs, but eight of them secreted unknown products from their roots under Fe deficiency. It was revealed that 15 kinds of phenylamides and 2 kinds of bread wheat phytoalexins were produced in Fe-deficient roots of Ae. tauschii. Multivariate and principal component analyses showed that chlorophyll content was correlated with shoot Fe concentration. Genome-wide association study analysis associated several genomic markers with the variations in each trait analysed. Our results suggest that Ae. tauschii has alleles that could improve Fe homoeostasis to generate Fe-deficiency-tolerant or Fe-biofortified bread wheat.

The objectives were to compare methods for class delimitation in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crops based on apparent productivity levels and establish similarities among them in terms of spatial overlapping, productive attributes and the use of nitrogen. In three wheat fields, high and low apparent productivity classes (APC) were defined based on eight methodologies: yield maps, soil maps, gramineae vegetation index, rotation crop index, interpretation of satellite images, management records, elevation and integrated soil and yield maps. In each APC, soil and crop yield components were determined under five nitrogen fertilization levels. Among delimitation methodologies, the degree of coincidence varied from 1.4 to 81.7%. The differences in soil properties, nitrogen use efficiency and grain yields were greater among fields than among APC within each field. In each field, the delimitation methodologies identified different single factors that discriminated among the potential management classes and were partially associated with the crop grain yields. The wheat crops at the low APC yielded 39% less and 12% less than at the high APC, respectively. The nitrogen fertilization, at the rate for maximum productivity for each ACP, reduced the yield differences between contrasting APC. Nitrogen fertilization also modified clustering of classes based on expected yields. Making management classes for wheat based on expected productivity is more accurate when based on previous crop production information under similar nitrogen fertilization conditions than the targeted crop.

Whilst hydrological signals are preserved in sediment stores as variations in sediment amount, character, and composition, studies in dryland settings such as Namibia that link sedimentological and compositional changes to palaeoflow are limited. Focusing on the Huab River, Skeleton Coast, this paper presents the first integrated study of textural, compositional, and stratigraphic features from a Namibian fluvial archive. Petrographic and heavy mineral assemblages from Raman laser spectroscopy are combined with lithostratigraphic and particle size analysis. Together with a chronology established through 42 optically stimulated luminescence ages, we reconstruct provenance, changes in river style, and fluvial response to climate. The Huab lithostratigraphic record details periods of flashy ephemeral flow interbedded with flow within well-defined channels. Compositional assemblages indicate that humid conditions during the early to mid-Holocene resulted in activation of sediment stores across the catchment. Episodic discharge within an ephemeral river from 12 to 9 ka was followed by a more sustained river flow in a channelized system from 7 to 5 ka. During the late Holocene, better hydraulic sorting, increased mechanical breakdown of polycrystalline grains, and flash flood lithofacies suggest that flow occurred within a more arid climate. This fine-scaled analysis of an ephemeral fluvial system indicates the utility of assessing compositional changes to distinguish between depositional regimes. This is an important approach for reconstructing fluvial response to climate and for obtaining palaeoenvironmental records from complex sedimentary archives in dryland river settings.

The Role of Biological Soil Crusts in Nitrogen Cycling and Soil Stabilization in Kangerlussuaq, West Greenland	ECOSYSTEMS												Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) naturally coexist with vascular plants in many dryland ecosystems. Although most studies of dryland biocrusts have been conducted in warm deserts, dryland biocrusts also exist in the Arctic, where they may be an important source of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) to nutrient-limited environments. In Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, wind-driven soil erosion has created a heterogeneous landscape where biocrusts dominate distinct patches of soil but are absent from the surrounding shrub and graminoid tundra. Prior to this study, little was known about the physical development and nutrient cycling of west Greenland biocrusts and their role in maintaining landscape heterogeneity. We characterized the physical properties, lichen assemblages, and nutrient concentrations of biocrusts and underlying soils along gradients in biocrust development and age. We found that biocrusts took 180 +/- 40years to fully develop and that biocrusts became thicker and soil penetration resistance increased as they developed. The N-fixing lichen Stereocaulon sp. was found throughout the study region at all stages of biocrust development. Natural N-15 abundance suggests that Stereocaulon sp. obtains about half of its N from biological fixation and that some biologically fixed N is incorporated into the underlying soils over time. Although the N and C concentrations of underlying soils increased slightly with biocrust development, nutrient concentrations under the most developed biocrusts remained low compared to the surrounding vegetated tundra. Our results suggest that biocrusts are a persistent feature and play an important role in maintaining the high spatial heterogeneity of the Kangerlussuaq terrestrial landscape.

However, there is a limited understanding of the climatic controls on the spatial and temporal variations of global deserts. Here, we use climate reanalysis datasets, global land use/land cover (LULC) products and the CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) model outputs to calculate the changing of global deserts during 1982-2020, and estimate future spatial trends of global deserts. Our results show that mean annual global desert area over this period is 17.64x10(6) km(2), accounting for 12% of the terrestrial land. Desert areas decreased rapidly from the end of the 1980s to the 1990s in North Africa and Australia, followed by a slow expansion in the early 21st century globally. Spatio-temporal variations of areas of arid climate are characterized by interdecadal fluctuations, and there are clear regional differences in dynamics of the aridity index (AI, used here as a proxy for the area of drylands) and desert areas. Statistical analyses reveal that increased vegetation cover is directly related to the reduction of desert area, while potential evaporation, surface temperature and humidity are also significantly correlated with the desert area. The relationship between wind speed and desert dynamics varies regionally. The results of the CMTP6 simulations suggest that global deserts will expand in the 21st century, albeit at different rates under the ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios. Desert expansions are modelled to be greatest in Asia, Africa and Australia, while those of southern North Africa may reduce as their southern borders migrate northwards.

Their movement pattern has been considered nomadic, but the details of their movement patterns remain unclear. The aim of this study is to gain an overall perspective of the movement of Mongolian gazelles, which experience diverse environmental conditions with large interannual variations across their continuous distribution range. Based on net squared displacement (NSD) modeling approach, the mixed migration type was the most observed type in the statistical assignment among five movement types, and some movements were assigned into the migration or sedentary. However, NSD seasonal change was irregular in the most annual movements of gazelles, suggesting the nomadic movements of individuals. Most gazelles tracked for more than a year changed their movement types annually, and the movement period differed among individuals. These results also support nomadic movement of the species, although some difficulties of modeling nomadism by the NSD approach were revealed.

Sensitivity of primary production to precipitation across the United States	ECOLOGY LETTERS												Primary production, a key regulator of the global carbon cycle, is highly responsive to variations in climate. Yet, a detailed, continental-scale risk assessment of climate-related impacts on primary production is lacking. We combined 16 years of MODIS NDVI data, a remotely sensed proxy for primary production, with observations from 1218 climate stations to derive values of ecosystem sensitivity to precipitation and aridity. For the first time, we produced an empirically-derived map of ecosystem sensitivity to climate across the conterminous United States. Over this 16-year period, annual primary production values were most sensitive to precipitation and aridity in dryland and grassland ecosystems. Century-long trends measured at the climate stations showed intensifying aridity and climatic variability in many of these sensitive regions. Dryland ecosystems in the western US may be particularly vulnerable to reductions in primary production and consequent degradation of ecosystem services as climate change and variability increase in the future.

Registration of 'Goldenhart', a Two-Rowed Spring Food Barley	JOURNAL OF PLANT REGISTRATIONS												'Goldenhart' (Reg. No. CV-368, PI 688445) is a two-rowed spring hull-less food barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) developed by the USDA-ARS, Aberdeen, ID, in cooperation with the University of Idaho Agricultural Experiment Station, and released in 2017. Goldenhart is derived from the cross of 02HR 4590/'CDC Fibar' and was advanced through modified bulk pedigree F-1-F-5. Goldenhart was tested at the USDA-ARS, and all other cooperative trials, as line 2Ab09-X06F058HL-31. Goldenhart was tested over 40 location years and has shown better yield under irrigated conditions than 'CDC Alamo' and 'Transit' and better yield in dryland areas than all the current two-rowed spring hull-less food barley cultivars, 'Julie', Transit, and CDC Alamo. Moreover, Goldenhart has shown significantly higher yields than Transit, the barley check with similar beta-glucan concentration, in both irrigated and dryland conditions. Goldenhart will be a good hull-less cultivar and a better alternative than Transit in the food barley production market.

Avulsions drive ecosystem services and economic changes in the Brazilian Pantanal wetlands	CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY												The Pantanal wetland is a mosaic of landscapes that brings together rich biodiversity with the valuable activities of fishing, tourism and ranching. Human occupation and land use in the headwaters have intensified the rate of channel avulsions in the lower reaches of the largest megafan on the Taquari River. This study evaluates the longterm changes of landscapes in the active depositional lobe of the Taquari megafan from the perspective of local communities of pantaneiros. Maps derived from multiple decades of multispectral Landsat data have proven useful for studying land cover changes through the relationship between dry (terrestrial vegetation and soil/dry pastures) and humid landscapes (open waters, aquatic macrophytes and wet soils), as well as through Sankey diagrams and spatiotemporal mapping with Boolean operations according to the rate of dryland recovery. We found that dryland recovery associated with an older and smaller avulsion (known as Ze ' da Costa) is analogous to that of a most recent and much larger avulsion (known as Caronal), which is still ongoing and has greater importance due to the scale of the impacts. Land value and fish capture depreciate as the partial Caronal avulsion still evolves, increasing the likelihood of environmental conflicts. While pantaneiros no longer profit from ecosystem services of provision (e.g., livestock or fishing), dryland recovery may deliver quantifiable ecosystem services of regulation. The strengthening of partnerships among stakeholders and the implementation of environmental compensation mechanisms are central for the best management of the Pantanal's megafans that ensure quality of life for all pantaneiros.

The re-imagining of grazed landscapes must recognize that current pastoralists have their own visions of what pastoralism does, can and should provide to both themselves and society at large. "Disrupters" may rapidly and permanently alter the social-ecological system but understanding pastoralist visions and values may help highlight effective and ethical mechanisms by which we can gently shift current systems toward socially re-imagined systems. Here we draw on two case studies from grazed dryland landscapes to highlight the ways in which understanding pastoralist values and visions could help with this shift. We choose case studies from contrasting institutional, cultural and economic contexts to better explore fit-for-purpose policy options. The first case study is from the typical and desert steppe of Mongolia, and the second from dryland Australia. Drawing on primary data and the literature, we explore in these contexts: what constitutes a meaningful livelihood for pastoralists? how might these imaginings align (or misalign) with the imaginings of the broader population? what inertia against future societal imaginings might a potential misalignment create? and how might policy provide a push (or pull) against such an inertia? We show that context-specific understandings of pastoralist values and visions can highlight appropriate policy options to encourage the movement of social-ecological systems toward those that are more socially desirable. However, the design of these options requires understanding unique combinations of pastoral and societal values, biophysical parameters and institutional contexts.

Seasonal variations in exotic earthworm populations in wheat fields of the Inland Pacific Northwest, USA	PEDOBIOLOGIA												Through their manipulation of soil physical and chemical properties, earthworms have the potential to increase nutrient mineralization and benefit crop production. However, this effect is dependent on numerous factors including earthworm densities and ecological strategies. In addition to impacting density, soil environmental conditions may limit earthworm activity to specific times during the growing season, moderating their effects on nutrient availability and crop growth. The purpose of this study was to determine the active period of earthworms to better assess their potential impact on crop productivity in dryland wheat production systems in the Palouse region of northern Idaho and eastern Washington, U.S.A. Earthworm community density, age structure, diversity, and soil moisture and soil temperature were monitored over a 14-month (April 2014-June 2015) period in six dryland wheat fields. All earthworms collected were exotic species, with the endogeic species, Aporrectodea trapezoides being predominant at all sites (87% of all adults identified). Allolobophora chlorotica, Lumbricus terrestris and Aporrectodea tuberculata were collected at lower frequencies (1.8-6.4% of adults). Mean densities ranged from 14 to 75 individuals m(-2), and populations transitioned to aestivation beginning in mid-June of both years. All earthworms were active (no aestivating individuals) on 56.9% of the sampling dates in 2014 and 71% of the days in 2015. A short active period and average densities at most sites of less than 100 individuals per m(2) suggest that the impact of earthworms on crop growth may be limited in conventional, dryland agricultural fields of this region.

Aridity index (AI) can effectively reflect the degree of dry-ness, but spatiotemporally continuous estimation of AI is still challenging. In this study, we develop an ensemble learning algorithm to retrieve AIs from MODIS satellite data in China from 2003 to 2020. The validation proves the high match between these satellite AIs and their corresponding station estimates with a root-mean-square error of 0.21, bias of -0.01, and correlation coefficient of 0.87. The analysis results indicate China has been drying in recent two decades. Moreover, the North China Plain is undergoing an intense drying process, whereas the Southeastern China is becoming significantly more humid. On the na-tional scale, China's dryland area shows a slight expansion, while the hyper arid area has a decreasing trend. These understandings have contributed to China's drought assessment and mitigation.

Fourteen years of continuous soil moisture records from plant and biocrust-dominated microsites	SCIENTIFIC DATA												Drylands cover similar to 41% of the terrestrial surface. In these water-limited ecosystems, soil moisture contributes to multiple hydrological processes and is a crucial determinant of the activity and performance of above- and belowground organisms and of the ecosystem processes that rely on them. Thus, an accurate characterisation of the temporal dynamics of soil moisture is critical to improve our understanding of how dryland ecosystems function and are responding to ongoing climate change. Furthermore, it may help improve climatic forecasts and drought monitoring. Here we present the MOISCRUST dataset, a long-term (2006-2020) soil moisture dataset at a sub-daily resolution from five different microsites (vascular plants and biocrusts) in a Mediterranean semiarid dryland located in Central Spain. MOISCRUST is a unique dataset for improving our understanding on how both vascular plants and biocrusts determine soil water dynamics in drylands, and thus to better assess their hydrological impacts and responses to ongoing climate change.

J	Sutton, A; Fisher, A; Metternicht, G				Sutton, Andres; Fisher, Adrian; Metternicht, Graciela			Assessing the Accuracy of Landsat Vegetation Fractional Cover for Monitoring Australian Drylands	REMOTE SENSING												Satellite-derived vegetation fractional cover (VFC) has shown to be a promising tool for dryland ecosystem monitoring. This model, calibrated through biophysical field measurements, depicts the sub-pixel proportion of photosynthetic vegetation (PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) and bare soil (BS). The distinction between NPV and BS makes it particularly important for drylands, as these fractions often dominate. Two Landsat VFC products are available for the Australian continent: the original Joint Remote Sensing Research Program (JRSRP) product, and a newer Digital Earth Australia (DEA) product. Although similar validation statistics have been presented for each, an evaluation of their differences has not been undertaken. Moreover, spatial variability of VFC accuracy within drylands has not been comprehensively assessed. Here, a large field dataset (4207 sites) was employed to compare Landsat VFC accuracy across the Australian continent, with detailed spatial and temporal analysis conducted on four regions of interest. Furthermore, spatiotemporal features of VFC unmixing error (UE) were explored to characterize model uncertainty in large areas yet to be field sampled. Our results showed that the JRSRP and DEA VFC were very similar (RMSE = 4.00-6.59) and can be employed interchangeably. Drylands did not show a substantial difference in accuracy compared to the continental assessment; however contrasting variations were observed in dryland subtypes (e.g., semi-arid and arid zones). Moreover, VFC effectively tracked total ground cover change over time. UE increased with tree cover and height, indicating that model uncertainty was low in typical dryland landscapes. Together, these results provide guiding points to understanding the Australian ecosystems where VFC can be used with confidence.

Here, we define the optimal flowering period (OFP) as the calendar time in which long-term risk of frost, water and heat stress are collectively minimised. Using the internationally-renowned farming systems model Agricultural Systems Production Systems sIMulator, we characterised combined effects of climate change and extreme climatic events on the OFPs of barley, durum wheat, canola, chickpeas, fababean and maize from 1910 to 2021. We generate response surfaces for irrigated and dryland conditions using a range of representative sowing times for early and late maturity genotypes. Global warming truncated crop lifecycles, shifting forward flowering of winter crops by 2-43 d in dryland environments, and by -6-19 d in environments with irrigation. Alleviation of water stress by irrigation delayed OFPs by 3-25 d or 11-30 d for early and late maturity winter crops, respectively, raising average yields of irrigated crops by 44%. Even so, irrigation was unable to completely negate the long-term yield penalty caused by the climate crisis; peak yields respectively declined by 24% and 13% for rainfed and irrigated crops over the 111 years simulation duration. We conclude with two important insights: (a) use of irrigation broadens OFPs, providing greater sowing time flexibility and likelihood of realising potential yields compared with dryland conditions and (b), the most preferable maturity durations for irrigated winter and summer crops to maximise potential yields are early-sown long-season (late) and later-sown short-season (early) maturity types, respectively.

This study was to evaluate the effects of straw strips mulch to potato growth, yield and economic benefits. The field experiment was conducted in northwest China in 2016 and 2017, including four treatments: (1), alternating narrow and wide ridges both mulched by black polyethylene film (PM); (2) alternating large ridges and small furrows with maize straw strips mulched only on the furrows (RS); (3) alternating the strips mulched with maize straw and bare plots with no ridges (PS); (4) traditional flat planting without mulching (CK). Results indicated that mulched treatments significantly (P < 0.05) increased tuber yield and WUE of potato compared with CK. The magnitude of yield in mulched treatments increase were 36.9-61.2% in 2016 and 38.7-45.5% in 2017, respectively, compared with CK. PM and RS treatments produced the highest tuber yield and enhanced water use efficiency by up to 74.8%, compared with CK. Soil water storage (0-2 m depth) was 21.5-39.9 nun in 2016 and 16.7-41.2 mm in 2017, respectively, greater in the mulched treatments, which significantly (P < 0.05) reduced evapotranspiration from sowing to seedling stages, compared with CK. Greater water availability was associated with greater biomass accumulation in above- and below-ground components, and plant height gain, during the growing season. PM significantly (P < 0.05) increased soil temperature (5-25 cm depth), which advanced the duration whole growth period by 6 days on average. RS and PM treatments experienced lower soil temperature (5-25 cm depth), which prolonged the duration whole growth period by 10 days on average, and increased the mass and percentage of Grade 1 tubers and the commodity rate (P < 0.05). As straw strips mulch application has lower input and labor costs than plastic film mulch, it produced the greatest economic benefits during this study, and it should be considered as an environmentally-friendly alternative to plastic film mulch for potato production in semiarid areas.`																			0378-3774	1873-2283				JAN 1	2019	211						142	151		10.1016/j.agwat.2018.09.048	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2018.09.048													WOS:000449139500015
J	Melstrom, RT				Melstrom, Richard T.			The Effect of Land Use Restrictions Protecting Endangered Species on Agricultural Land Values	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS												This article examines the effect of U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) regulations on agricultural values. Agricultural development is an important contributor to habitat and biodiversity loss in the United States. The ESA attempts to limit this loss by prohibiting habitat destruction on private lands, but this practice is controversial because it places much of the burden for conservation on farmers. I measure the effect of these restrictions on agriculture using a hedonic analysis of county-level agricultural land values, profits, and revenues reported in the last four rounds of the agricultural census. Results provide strong evidence that ESA regulations depress these three economic measures in dryland areas, which includes counties with less than 1% of agricultural land in irrigation. Specifically, I find that farmland value and profit decline 4% after listing on average at the county level in dryland areas with protected habitat. There is no evidence that values are affected in irrigated counties.																			0002-9092	1467-8276				JAN	2021	103	1					162	184		10.1111/ajae.12127	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajae.12127													WOS:000598735200012

This study aimed to determine how the latitudinal patterns of leaf and soil C:N:P stoichiometry are affected by climate and vegetation types in the dryland ecosystems. The concentrations of leaf C, N, and P in herb community as well as soil nutrient concentrations along a 500-km-long latitudinal gradient in Northern Shaanxi of the Loess Plateau, were measured. The results showed that the soil C, N, P and C:N:P ratios at all three depths (0-10, 10-20, and 20-40 cm) showed significant latitudinal trends (except for soil C:N ratios) (P < 0.01). In general, the soil C, N and C:N:P ratios decreased exponentially while soil P increased first and then decreased with the latitude. The soil C, N, C:P, and N:P ratios at all three depths (0-10, 10-20 and 20-40 cm) were positively correlated with MAT and MAP (P < 0.05), while soil P and C:N ratios at all three depths were weakly correlated with MAT and MAP (P > 0.05). In addition, leaf C:N:P stoichiometry was significantly correlated with the latitude, MAT, and MAP (except for N:P ratios) (P < 0.01), such that, leaf C, C:N, and C:P ratios decreased as the latitude increased and MAT and MAP decreased, and leaf N, P concentrations increased as the latitude increased and MAT and MAP decreased, while leaf N:P ratios were weakly correlated with the latitude, MAT, and MAP (P > 0.05). Furthermore, the leaf C:N:P stoichiometry of herbaceous communities was related to the soil properties (except for soil P), and we found that the C:P ratios between the soil and leaves were strongly correlated. Compared with the global scale, the relatively high N:P ratios indicated that the vegetation growth of the herb community in the dryland of the Loess Plateau was more susceptible to P limitation.

However, the way in which land use and soil type affects the soil organic C (SOC) pools, and soil aggregation in the Sanjiang Plain, has not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate soil physic-ochemical properties, soil aggregates, and C management index (CMI) in three different LUSs (grassland, dryland, and paddy field) under two STs (meadow soil and albic soil) of the Sanjiang Plain in northeast China. A total of 60 composite soil samples were collected for laboratory analyses. The results were as follows: soil properties were affected by LUS and ST, especially soil chemical properties; ST had no significant effect on soil aggregates but significantly affected its SOC content, while LUS had a significant effect on soil aggregates (p < 0.01), except for small macro-aggregates (2-0.25 mm); the mean weight diameter (MWD) and SOC in meadow soil was significantly different under different land uses, with grassland being the highest and dryland the lowest. However, there was no significant difference in albic soil. The heterogeneity of grassland, dryland, and paddy field showed that different LUSs had particular effects on SOC and its active components because LUS had significant effects on C pool index (CPI) and CMI, but ST and its interaction had no significant effects on CPI and CMI. Overall, the results showed that LUS was an important factor affecting CMI in the Sanjiang Plain, rather than ST, and the paddy field CMI was optimal in the Sanjiang Plain.

The effects of land use types and the intensity of human activities on the distribution and sources of soil MPs at the watershed scale are unclear. In this study, 62 surface soil sites in representing five land use types (urban, tea garden, dryland, paddy field and woodland) and 8 freshwater sediment sites were investigated in the Lihe River watershed. MPs were detected in all samples, and the average abundance of soil and sediments was 401.85 +/- 214.02 and 222.13 +/- 54.66 items/kg, respectively. The soil MPs abundance followed the sequence: urban > paddy field > dryland > tea garden > woodland. Soil MP distribution and MP communities were significant different (p < 0.05) among land use types. The similarity of MP community highly correlated with geographic distance, and woodlands and freshwater sediments may be a potential fate for MPs in the Lihe River watershed. Soil clay, pH, and bulk density significantly correlated with MP abundance and fragment shape (p < 0.05). The positive correlation between population density, Total-Point of Interest (POI) and MP diversity indicates the importance of intensity of human activities in exacerbating soil MP pollution (p < 0.001). Plastic waste sources accounted for 65.12%, 58.60%, 48.15% and 25.35% of MPs in urban, tea garden, dryland and paddy field soils, respectively. Differences in the intensity of agricultural activities and cropping patterns were associated with different percentages of mulching film sources in the three types of agricultural soils. This study provides new ideas for the quantitative analysis of soil MP sources in different land use types.																			0045-6535	1879-1298				MAY	2023	324								138292	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.138292	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.138292		MAR 2023						36870618					WOS:000961902400001
J	Mackelprang, R; Vaishampayan, P; Fisher, K				Mackelprang, Rachel; Vaishampayan, Parag; Fisher, Kirsten			Adaptation to Environmental Extremes Structures Functional Traits in Biological Soil Crust and Hypolithic Microbial Communities	MSYSTEMS												Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are widespread in drylands and deserts. At the microhabitat scale, they also host hypolithic communities that live under semitranslucent stones. Both environmental niches experience exposure to extreme conditions such as high UV radiation, desiccation, temperature fluctuations, and resource limitation. However, hypolithic communities are somewhat protected from extremes relative to biocrust communities. Conditions are otherwise similar, so comparing them can answer outstanding questions regarding adaptations to environmental extremes. Using metagenomic sequencing, we assessed the functional potential of dryland soil communities and identified the functional underpinnings of ecological niche differentiation in biocrusts versus hypoliths. We also determined the effect of the anchoring photoautotroph (moss or cyanobacteria). Genes and pathways differing in abundance between biocrusts and hypoliths indicate that biocrust communities adapt to the higher levels of UV radiation, desiccation, and temperature extremes through an increased ability to repair damaged DNA, sense and respond to environmental stimuli, and interact with other community members and the environment. Intracellular competition appears to be crucial to both communities, with biocrust communities using the Type VI Secretion System (T6SS) and hypoliths favoring a diversity of antibiotics. The dominant primary producer had a reduced effect on community functional potential compared with niche, but an abundance of genes related to monosaccharide, amino acid, and osmoprotectant uptake in moss-dominated communities indicates reliance on resources provided to heterotrophs by mosses. Our findings indicate that functional traits in dryland communities are driven by adaptations to extremes and we identify strategies that likely enable survival in dryland ecosystems. IMPORTANCE Biocrusts serve as a keystone element of desert and dryland ecosystems, stabilizing soils, retaining moisture, and serving as a carbon and nitrogen source in oligotrophic environments. Biocrusts cover approximately 12% of the Earth's terrestrial surface but are threatened by climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. Given their keystone role in ecosystem functioning, loss will have wide-spread consequences. Biocrust microbial constituents must withstand polyextreme environmental conditions including high UV exposure, desiccation, oligotrophic conditions, and temperature fluctuations over short time scales. By comparing biocrust communities with co-occurring hypolithic communities (which inhabit the ventral sides of semitranslucent stones and are buffered from environmental extremes), we identified traits that are likely key adaptations to extreme conditions. These include DNA damage repair, environmental sensing and response, and intracellular competition. Comparison of the two niches, which differ primarily in exposure levels to extreme conditions, makes this system ideal for understanding how functional traits are structured by the environment.																			2379-5077					AUG 30	2022	7	4								10.1128/msystems.01419-21	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/msystems.01419-21		JUL 2022						35852333					WOS:000827874100001

In this study, we integrated detailed field investigations with high-resolution remote sensing products to assess gully erosion susceptibility and identify its controlling factors using Random Forest (RF) model in six representative watersheds across contrasting (highland, midland, and lowland) agro-ecological environments in the Upper Blue Nile basin of Ethiopia. Data for 20 controlling factors were extracted from datasets at eight different pixel resolutions ranging from 0.5 to 30 m in a geographic information system environment. About 70 % and 30 % of the dataset in each watershed were randomly selected for model training and validation purposes, respectively. Multicollinearity and correlation analyses were performed to identify variables with collinearity problems and explain their statistical relationships among the other variables. RF predicted gully erosion susceptibility and the relative importance of the controlling factors. The model showed outstanding performance when the finest-resolution datasets were used. Elevation, height above nearest drainage, runoff curve number-II, distance from streams, drainage density, soil type, and land use/land cover were found to be the most important factors controlling the spatial distribution of gullies in all six watersheds, irrespective of the watershed treatment conditions and agroecological settings. Thus, the most susceptible land to gully erosion was low-lying grazing and cultivated lands with sensitive soil of high runoff-generation capacity located within short horizontal and vertical distances from drainage networks. Therefore, basin- and watershed-scale gully management strategies should give priority to these areas. The identification of the runoff curve number-II, a hydrologic parameter for predicting direct runoff from excess rainfall, as one of the most important factors controlling gully erosion was a novel finding which will be useful for developing improved process-based gully erosion models.

Early prediction of wheat grain yield production from root-zone soil water content at heading using Crop RS-Met	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Wheat production in drylands is determined greatly by the available water at the critical growth stages. In dry years, farmers usually face the dilemma of whether to harvest at an early stage for hay or silage, with reduced profit, or leave the crop for grain production with the risk of a major economic loss. Thus, an early prediction of potential wheat grain yield production is essential for agricultural decision making, particularly in water-limited areas. Here, we test whether using a proximal-based biophysical model of actual evapotranspiration (water use) and root-zone soil water content (SWC) - Crop RS-Met - may assist in providing early grain yield predictions in dryland wheat fields. Crop RS-Met was examined in eight experimental fields comprising a variety of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars exposed to different treatments and amounts of water supply (185 mm. 450 mm). Crop RS-Met was first validated against SWC measurements at the root-zone profile. Then, modeled SWC at heading (SWCHeading,) was regressed against end-of-season grain yields (GY(EOS)), which ranged from 1.30 tons ha(-1) to 7.12 tons ha(-1), for a total of 56 treatment blocks in 4 seasonal years (2014-2017). Results show that Crop RS-Met accurately reproduce seasonal changes in SWC with an average R-2 of 0.89 +/- 0.05 and RMSE and bias of 0.014 +/- 0.004 m(3) m(-3) and -0,002 +/- 0.004 m(3) m(-3), respectively. Modeled SWCHeading showed high and significant positive linear relationship with GY(EOS) (GYEOS[tons ha(-1)] = 0.080 x SWCHeading[mm] - 5.387; R-2 = 0.90; P < 0.001; N = 56). Moreover, Crop RS-Met showed to be capable of accurately predicting GY(EOS) even in cases where water supply and grain yield had adverse relationships. Aggregating results to the field-scale level and classifying fields per water supply conditions resulted in an even stronger linear relationship (R-2 = 0.94; P < 0.001; N = 9). We conclude that Crop RS-Met may be used to predict GY(EOS) at heading in dryland fields for possible use by farmers in decision making at critical wheat growth stages.

Effects of soil mulches and conditioners on seedling emergence and survival of <i>Astragalus nigricans</i> Barneby in an arid steppe rangeland	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Soil mulches and conditioners have been shown to improve soil moisture conservation, infiltration, and seed germination and survival, but their interactive effects with sporadic rainfall and the existing vegetation have rarely been considered. In an experimental field study, we assessed the effects of soil additives (sawdust and hydrogel) and mulches (river sand and plant debris) on seedling emergence and survival of Astragalus nigricans Barneby, in the rangelands of Mashhad, northeast Iran. We also assessed any effects on soil moisture and temperature several days after rain in July 2017 and May 2018 and weed composition, density, and diversity. The most successful treatment was hydrogel, associated with earlier seedling emergence for A. nigricans, greater seedling survival, and biomass production. Sawdust and sand treatments were useful for root proliferation and seedling emergence in the spring of the first season, but they led to high seedling mortality under drought. Debris of Artemisia khorasanica shoots was the most efficient and consistent treatment for soil moisture conservation and temperature stability in both years, but its possible allelopathic effects led to high seedling mortality and a long delay (41 days) on seedling emergence. Plant debris also negatively affected the density, richness, and diversity of nontarget plant species. Despite differences among different rainfall events, mulch treatments have an important role in regenerating degraded rangelands.

The assessment of global scale desertification vulnerability to climate change and human activity is important to help decision makers formulate the best strategies for land rehabilitation and combat global desertification in sensitive areas. There is no global desertification vulnerability map that considers both climate change and human activities. The main aim of this study was to construct a new index, the global desertification vulnerability index (GDVI), by combining climate change and human activity, provide another perspective on desertification vulnerability on a global scale, and project its future evolution. Using the probability density function of the GDVI, we classified desertification vulnerability into four classes: very high, high, medium, and low. The results of the analysis indicated that areas around deserts and barren land have a higher risk of desertification. Areas with a moderate, high, and very high desertification risk accounted for 13%, 7%, and 9% of the global area, respectively. Among the representative concentration pathways (RCPs), RCP8.5 projected that the area of moderate to very high desertification risk will increase by 23% by the end of this century. The areas where desertification risks are predicted to increase over time are mainly in Africa, North America, and the northern areas of China and India.

Structure stability of acidic Luvisols: Effects of tillage type and exogenous additives	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Restoring physical quality of acidic Luvisols from the Ethiopian highlands subjected to long-term conventional tillage (CT) by traditional no tillage (NT) system may take 20-30 years. Use of exogenous additives may speed up reclamation of soil physical quality. The objective of the study was to examine the effects of combining two tillage systems (NT and CT) with additives (polyacrylamide [PAM] and lime) on accelerating structure stabilization of Luvisols. The high energy moisture characteristics (HEMC) method was used to evaluate: (i) the contribution of PAM dose (0, 25, 50, 100, 200 mg L-1) and slaked lime (1.6 g L-1), on pore size distribution (PSD), and structure stability indices of six soils, five under long-term cropland (CT-crop) and one under grassland for grazing (NT-grass), and (ii) the relations between the stability indices obtained from these six soils. Ethanol and deionized water were used for wetting of soil aggregates. The water retention curves of the samples were characterized by a modified version of the van Genuchten model that yields (i) the parameters alpha and n (that control the location and steepness of the water retention curve, respectively), and (ii) a soil structural stability index (SI). The results revealed that, compared with the control, the additives significantly altered soil PSD, increased SI and alpha, and decreased n (particularly with lime). Untreated NT-grass and CT-crop soil treated with low concentration of PAM (25 mg L-1) or lime, resulted in comparable SI, while high PAM concentrations (100-200 mg L-1) yielded 2-3 times greater SI values than untreated NT or CT samples. Exponential type relations were identified between SI and model parameters (alpha or n) or PAM dose. These relations could assist in evaluating the suitability of tillage system together with additives for stabilizing soil structure. Our result advocate the application of small doses of exogenous additives (PAM, lime), in combination with NT, for improving the structure and quality of acidic Luvisols at a faster rate.

Clearing and burning brigalow (<i>Acacia harpophylla</i>) in Queensland, Australia, temporarily increases surface soil fertility prior to nutrient decline under cropping or grazing	SOIL RESEARCH												In the Brigalow Belt bioregion of Australia, clearing of brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) scrub vegetation for agriculture has altered nutrient cycling over millions of hectares. In order to quantify the effect of this vegetation clearing and land use change on soil fertility, the Brigalow Catchment Study commenced in 1965. Initial clearing and burning of brigalow scrub resulted in a temporary increase of mineral nitrogen, total and available phosphorus, total and exchangeable potassium and total sulfur in the surface soil (0-0.1 m) as a result of soil heating and the ash bed effect. Soil pH also increased, but did not peak immediately after burning. Soil fertility declined significantly over the subsequent 32 years. Under cropping, organic carbon declined by 46%, total nitrogen by 55%, total phosphorus by 29%, bicarbonate-extractable phosphorus by 54%, acid-extractable phosphorus by 59%, total sulfur by 49%, total potassium by 9% and exchangeable potassium by 63% from post-burn, pre-cropping concentrations. Fertility also declined under grazing but in a different pattern to that observed under cropping. Organic carbon showed clear fluctuation but it was not until the natural variation in soil fertility over time was separated from the anthropogenic effects of land use change that a significant decline was observed. Total nitrogen declined by 22%. Total phosphorus declined by 14%, equating to only half of the decline under cropping. Bicarbonate-extractable phosphorus declined by 64% and acid-extractable phosphorus by 66%; both greater than the decline observed under cropping. Total sulfur declined by 23%; less than half of the decline under cropping. A similar decline in total potassium was observed under both land uses, with a 10% decline under grazing. Exchangeable potassium declined by 59%. The primary mechanism of nutrient loss depended on the specific land use and nutrient in question.

Effects of farming systems, tillage, and traffic practices on deep drainage and soil salt loads in the Queensland Murray-Darling and Fitzroy Basins using soil chloride	SOIL RESEARCH												Context Cropping in the Queensland Murray-Darling and Fitzroy Basins has precursors for secondary salinity - high soil salt loads and increased drainage after clearing. Aims To measure changes in deep drainage, for key tillage, traffic, and cropping systems. Methods Steady-state and transient chloride (Cl) mass-balance were applied to Cl profiles from four tillage and crop rotation trials and one controlled traffic trial in southern and central Queensland, to determine deep drainage below the root zone. Key results Large downward movement of Cl occurred after clearing. Deep drainage from transient Cl balance for cropping was a small proportion of rainfall but considerably higher than under native vegetation. Deep drainage was consistently greater under zero than conventional tillage, for both winter and summer cropping. For example, deep drainage was greatest for zero tillage (similar to 45 mm/year) and least for conventional, stubble mulch, and reduced tillage (2-6.3 mm/year) at the highest-rainfall site (677 mm/year). Deep drainage was 12.7 and 7.9 mm/year for zero and conventional tillage, respectively, at the lowest-rainfall site (497 mm/year). Drainage under continuous wheat conventional tillage was more than twice that where some summer crops were included. At Billa Billa, continuous wheat had greater deep drainage by three to five times than continuous sorghum for three of four tillage systems. No drainage was detected during 6 years of opportunity cropping. A pasture legume ley had only 1.7 mm/year of deep drainage. Deep drainage was less for compacted than non-compacted treatments (23.3 vs 38.2 mm/year). Conclusion and implications Increased deep drainage with zero tillage and controlled traffic can be reduced using summer crops, particularly opportunity cropping where crops are planted when soil water is sufficient, and ley pastures.

However, few studies examine how tillage and climate impact soil health indicators deeper than 30 cm in dryland wheat systems. We evaluated how select soil chemical (i.e., nutrients and pH), biological (i.e., carbon [C] and nitrogen [N] fractions and ratios), and physical (i.e., mean weight diameter [MWD] of soil aggregates) health indicators were impacted by depth, tillage, and climate. We sampled soil profiles of the Palouse soil series from 0- to 85 cm in depth at three no-till (NT) and three conventional till (CT) sites across a mean annual precipitation (MAP) gradient (460-660 mm) in the Palouse River watershed. NT sites, compared to CT sites, had higher total C (TC) and N (TN), permanganate oxidizable C, hot-water extractable C and N, and cold-water extractable N (0-5 cm); greater soil moisture (0-29 cm); larger MWD (0-5 cm; 10-85 cm); but lower soil pH (0-10 cm; 59-85 cm); less TC, TN, and NO3- (29-85 cm); less NH4+ and mineralizable soil C (MINC) (29-59 cm); and lower autoclaved-citrate extractable (ACE) protein (0-5 cm; 29-85 cm). Sites with higher MAP had greater soil moisture (0-29 cm), higher MINC (0-85 cm), lower CWC (5-10 cm; 29-59 cm), and lower TC and ACE protein (29-85 cm). The variable effects of tillage and climate on these soil health indicators with soil depth show the importance of evaluating soil health in both surface and subsurface soil depths in dryland wheat cropping systems.

Application of Ceres-Millet model of DSSAT for simulating millet varieties under different sowing windows in Niger	JOURNAL OF CROP IMPROVEMENT												Choosing an appropriate variety and planting date could help farmers increase the recurrent low pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.) yields recorded in Niger. Field experiments were conducted at the National Agricultural Research Institute of Niger (N'Dounga) during the 2016 and 2017 rainy seasons to evaluate the performance of the CERES-Millet model in simulating the growth and yield of pearl millet varieties. Treatments consisted of two sowing windows (late June and mid-July) and four varieties (HKP, ZATIB, CIVT, and H80-10 GR) arranged in a split-plot design with three replications. Sowing dates were allocated to the main plots, whereas varieties were assigned to the subplots. The data collected on days to 50% flowering, days to physiological maturity, grain yield, and above-ground biomass during 2016 and 2017 were used to calibrate and evaluate the CERES-Millet model for simulating sowing windows. The model was used to simulate the long-term effects of different sowing windows using long-term historical weather data from 1983 to 2017 in Kollo. The results for model calibration showed that simulated growth and yield of millet were in good agreement with their corresponding observed values. The d-index was 0.99 for days to anthesis, 0.97 for days to physiological maturity, 0.93 for grain yield, and 0.79 for above-ground biomass. The results for both calibration and evaluation showed that normalized root mean square errors were less than 10%. The values of the d-index were also within the acceptable range for all the parameters. Therefore, the CERES-Millet model was robust enough to successfully simulate millet growth and yield in Niger. Seasonal analysis revealed that sowing should be done from early June to mid-June for ZATIB and H80-10 GR varieties. However, it should be done from early June to late June for CIVT and from mid-June to early July for HKP.

Assessment of Landsat-Based Evapotranspiration Using Weighing Lysimeters in the Texas High Plains	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the largest data gaps in water management due to the limited availability of measured evapotranspiration data, and because ET spatial variability is difficult to characterize at various scales. Satellite-based ET estimation has been shown to have great potential for water resource planning and for estimating agricultural water use at field, watershed, and regional scales. Satellites with low spatial resolution, such as NASA's MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), and those with higher spatial resolution, such as Landsat (Land Satellite), can potentially be used for irrigation water management purposes and other agricultural applications. The objective of this study is to assess satellite based-ET estimation accuracy using measured ET from large weighing lysimeters. Daily, seven-day running average, monthly, and seasonal satellite-based ET data were compared with corresponding lysimeter ET data. This study was performed at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory (CPRL) in Bushland, Texas, USA. The daily time series Landsat ET estimates were characterized as poor for irrigated fields, with a Nash Sutcliff efficiency (NSE) of 0.37, and good for monthly ET, with an NSE of 0.57. For the dryland managed fields, the daily and monthly ET estimates were unacceptable with an NSE of -1.38 and -0.19, respectively. There are various reasons for these results, including uncertainties with remotely sensed data due to errors in aerodynamic resistance surface roughness length estimation, surface temperature deviations between irrigated and dryland conditions, poor leaf area estimation in the METRIC model under dryland conditions, extended gap periods between satellite data, and using the linear interpolation method to extrapolate daily ET values between two consecutive scenes (images).

How-ever, a comprehensive study about its effectiveness especially when applied combined with other amendments have rarely been conducted in the tropical highland climatic conditions, such as in Ethiopia. The study assessed the effectiveness of PAM (P = 40 kg ha(-1)) alone or integrated with other soil amendments such as gypsum (G = 5 t ha(-1)), lime (L = 4 t ha(-1)) and biochar (B = 8 t ha(-1)) on runoff and soil loss at Aba Gerima watershed in the Upper Blue Nile basin, northwest of Ethiopia, where there is high erosion-caused soil degradation. A total of 79 daily runoff and sediment data were collected from eight runoff plots (1.3m x 4m) with three replications planted with teff (Eragrostis tef) crop for two years (2018 & 2019) rainy seasons. Associated changes in soil physicochemical properties and crop growth parameters were investigated. Treatments reduced seasonal runoff by 12-39% and soil loss by 13-53%. The highest reduction in runoff was observed from P + B and PAM treatments while the highest reduction in soil loss was observed from that of P + L and PAM treatments. Integrating PAM with other amendments improved soil structural stability, moisture content, soil pH (P + L) and organic matter (P + B), leading to favorable environment for crop growth (biomass yield) and reduced runoff and soil erosion. Unlike PAM, biochar and lime amendments may need more time after application to be more effective. Hence continuing the field experiment and studying physicochemical mechanisms for extended period will better elucidate their single or combined effectiveness over time.

However, it is now known whether the system can improve its adaptability to the procedure through a training based on the conditioning exercises themselves. This study set out to test a PAPE protocol in 14 swimmers before and after a training period. Initially, the subjects' strength in both the lower and upper extremities was tested. Subsequently, the effects of two types of warm-ups were tested in a 50-metre swimming test, one a standard warm-up and the other one a PAPE which included maximum repetitions executed on eccentric training machines. A 6-week training protocol was then applied (2 days/week), in which maximum repetitions were executed on eccentric training machines, and the effects were once again studied both on the strength tests and after both warm-ups. The performance improved at 15 metres after the PAPE compared to the standard situation, but not in the subsequent metre marks. After the 6 weeks, increases in strength in the lower extremities (14.46%) and upper extremities (12.4%) were recorded. Following the application of the PAPE warm-up, the starting speed increased and swimming time and speed improved at 25, 40 and 50 metres, which suggests that the subjects were capable of attaining a better balance between fatigue and potentiation.

J	Naselli-Flores, L; Marrone, F				Naselli-Flores, Luigi; Marrone, Federico			Different invasibility of permanent and temporary waterbodies in a semiarid Mediterranean Island	INLAND WATERS												Nonindigenous species (NIS) represent a threat to aquatic biodiversity worldwide. However, freshwater ecosystems in drylands are potentially more prone to biological invasions than those located in temperate regions because of the higher number of artificial waterbodies generally occurring in these areas, which might act as invasion hubs for NIS. We review the available information about NIS in Sicilian waterbodies, discuss the role exerted by artificial lakes and ponds in facilitating the establishment of NIS in arid and semiarid areas, and compare the invasibility of permanent and temporary waterbodies in drylands. Artificial waterbodies increase the target-area effect for dispersers and provide a hospitable environment for NIS because of their recent origin and the lack of efficient biological filters against newcomers, thus acting as bridgeheads and invasion hubs favouring invasive species. Finally, we propose actions to attenuate the threats caused by NIS to the sensitive native biota of aquatic ecosystems in drylands.

Forage Crops	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Mixing cereal with legume crops is an efficient approach for improving forage production and ensuring the sustainable development of agriculture and livestock. However, the knowledge of the relationship between forage production and interspecific competition in the forage oat (Avena sativa L.) and common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) mixed cropping system remains unclear. A 2-year field experiment was conducted in 2020 and 2021 to investigate the effects of different mixed cropping systems (peer mixing (PM), alternate-row mixing (AM), cross mixing (CM), bar mixing (BM), sole forage oat (SO), and sole common vetch (SV)) on the dry matter production, forage quality, land equivalent ratio (LER), and competition parameters. The results showed that the system forage yield increased by 13.4-202.8% when forage oat was mixed with common vetch (p < 0.05). However, no significant difference was obtained between the AM and PM mixed cropping systems. Additionally, the forage oat-common vetch mixed cropping improved crude protein yield by 52.5-150.1% compared with monocultures (p < 0.05). The LER values were greater than the one when forage oat was mixed with common vetch, especially for the AM system (averaged 1.38). In addition, forage oat was the dominant crop and had higher aggressiveness and competitive ratios compared to common vetch, but without a significant difference in the aggressiveness and competitive ratio in mixed cropping systems. It indicated that mixing of cereal with legume crops was helpful in enhancing resource use efficiency without obvious interspecific competition. Consequently, the AM mixed cropping system is recommended for supporting the sustainable development of agriculture and livestock production in the arid region of China when considering both forage production and nutritional quality.

Soil health and grain yield impacts of climate resilient agriculture projects: Evidence from southern Malawi	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												CONTEXT: Climate resilient agriculture (CRA) projects like watershed restoration efforts can enhance agricultural systems' resilience to climate change and extreme weather shocks by improving soil health and grain yields in vulnerable communities. One such project, Wellness and Agriculture for Life Advancement (WALA) implemented watershed restoration across eight districts in southern Malawi from 2009 to 2014 to improve degraded soils and boost grain yields. Yet, rigorous analyses of soil health and grain yield impacts of CRA projects remain limited in southern Malawi, other dryland areas of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and elsewhere. OBJECTIVE: Using the watershed restoration context of the WALA project as a case study, we estimated the core determinants of CRA program participation and the impacts of participation on soil health and grain yields among smallholder farmers in southern Malawi in 2016. METHODS: We applied an endogenous switching regression with a control function approach to primary survey data from a sample of 808 agricultural households from five WALA districts to estimate the determinants of participation in the CRA project, and the impacts on soil health parameters and grain yields, accounting for endogeneity and selectivity bias. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We found that participation in the project improved grain yields in terms of maize (Zea mays) by 61% in 2016 - a drought year, and soil health parameters including nitrogen, potassium, soil organic matter, and soil organic carbon by 41%, 31%, 57%, and 44% respectively. Results suggest that CRA projects are essential devices for improving soil health and grain yields in dryland areas such as southern Malawi, elsewhere in SSA, and beyond. SIGNIFICANCE: This research shows that CRA projects can enhance sustainable agriculture by improving soil health parameters, increasing grain yields, and building agricultural systems' resilience to climate change and extreme weather shocks, thereby contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals on hunger and climate action in dryland areas of developing countries.

Effects of long-term nutrient management in semi-arid Vertisols on soil quality and crop productivity in a cotton-greengram intercropping system	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Context: Systematic research on the long-term effects of integrated nutrient management (INM) on soil quality and crop productivity, particularly in semi-arid climates, is limited. However, such research is essential, particularly for smallholder farmers in semi-arid regions, to address the triple challenges of sustainable agriculture, food and fiber security, and environmental degradation.Objectives: This study aimed to investigate changes in soil quality and cotton-greengram system productivity following long-term nutrient management and to establish a quantitative relationship between the soil quality index and system productivity.Methods: A study was conducted from 2017 to 21 in a long-term field experiment initiated in 1987 with eight treatment combinations, including sole organics ('ANFYM, 'ANGli), inorganics (NPK, 'ANK), and the integration of organics to substitute for the fertilizer-N requirement (INM) [(N + NGli)PK, (N + NFYM)PK, (NGli)PK] in the cotton-greengram intercropping system of the semi-arid region in Maharashtra, India. Surface soil samples (0-0.2 m) were collected and analyzed for different physical, chemical, and biological properties to develop a soil quality index. The soil quality index was then validated against the system productivity.Result: The INM treatments, where 50 % N was substituted by Gliricidia [(N + NGli)PK] or FYM [(N + NFYM)PK], demonstrated significantly higher cotton-greengram system productivity, sustainable yield index, and soil quality index, while the lowest values were observed in the control. Soil organic carbon (SOC), available nitrogen (N), mean weight diameter, and alkaline phosphatase were identified as the key soil quality indicators. The predictive relationship between system productivity and soil quality index revealed that maintaining 6.5 g kg-1 (chromic acid oxidizable) SOC and 253 kg (potassium permanganate oxidizable) available N ha-1 in the soil of semi-arid climates is crucial for sustaining cropping system productivity.Conclusion: INM that encourages balanced fertilization must include partial N supplementation by FYM/Glir-icidia as part of the nutrient application package in semi-arid Vertisols.Implications/significance: Our study highlights the significance of adopting sustainable agricultural practices to achieve optimal soil conditions for maximum productivity in semi-arid regions. This knowledge can benefit farmers and researchers globally in optimizing INM practices for different crops and agroecological zones, aiding in the development of sustainable farming strategies and ensuring food-fiber security while preserving soil quality and protecting the environment.

This study investigated the influence of soil nutrients and stand structure on aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) in the oak communities. We aimed to understand the major factors and their possible pathways that determine the ecosystem productivity. The biomass and the ANPP were estimated using plot surveys and litterfall collection in fixed plots. Linear regressions and structural equation models were used to evaluate the relationships among soil nutrients, stand structure (including vertical and horizontal structure), and ANPP. The results showed that the effect sizes of soil nutrients on ANPP and leaf production were near 60% and 70%, respectively. More than 70% of the variation in woody production was explained by stand structure, while litterfall production was largely dependent on stand vertical structure with effect size of 64%. The effect of soil nutrients on stand structural indices was detected only in the case of the vertical structure. The results suggested that soil nutrients could affect forest productivity both directly and indirectly in coordination with stand vertical structure, and that the effect of stand structure was limited in these communities.

Structure Stability of Cultivated Soils from Semi-Arid Region: Comparing the Effects of Land Use and Anionic Polyacrylamide Application	AGRONOMY-BASEL												The Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations call for applying soil management practices that contribute land degradation neutrality. Our objectives were to investigate the effect of (i) soil management-conventional tillage (CT under crop) and no-tillage (NT under grass)-and (ii) an amendment (polyacrylamide (PAM)) application on the structure stability indices of soils from a semi-arid region. Two sets of experiments were conducted using the high-energy moisture characteristic (HEMC) method for the assessment of (i) land-use type (CT vs. NT) in soils (30 samples) varying in texture, and (ii) the effect of six PAM concentrations (0, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg L-1) on three typical soils (sandy clay loam, clay loam, and clay) under CT management; then, the contributions of PAM concentration (CT) and NT were compared. Water retention curves of samples were obtained at a matric potential from 0 to -5.0 J kg(-1) and characterized by a modified van Genuchten model that yields (i) model parameters alpha and n, and (ii) a soil structure stability index (SI). The treatments affected the shape of the water retention curves. Change of land use from CT to NT and PAM application to CT soil increased the SI and alpha, and decreased n compared to CT-managed soils. The magnitude of the NT and PAM effect was inversely related to soil clay content. CT-managed soils treated with a low PAM rate (10-25 mg L-1) gave SI comparable to that obtained for the NT-managed soils, while CT-managed soils treated with a high PAM rate (50-200 mg L-1) yielded 1.3-2.0 and 2-4 times higher SI than that for NT and CT-managed soils, respectively. Our findings suggest that both the change of land use to NT or the addition of small amounts of PAM are viable alternatives for stabilizing CT-managed weakly alkaline semi-arid soils, whose soil structure stability is a priori limited.

Whilst there is a long history of research into the evolution of erosional landforms such as yardangs, little research has investigated how dryland processes influence the erosion of built structures. Earthen heritage sites located in arid and semi-arid environments experience rapid deterioration caused by exposure to environmental drivers such as wind and rain. Understanding how these environmental drivers interact with each other and cause deterioration to earthen material is vital for successful conservation strategies. To address this need, we present the Vegetation and Sediment TrAnsport model for Heritage Deterioration (ViSTA-HD) that simulates the risk of polishing, pitting and slurry on earthen heritage in a spatially specific manner. A technical description of the model is provided, and sensitivity and validation tests are reported. The model is then used to simulate the risk of deterioration occurring over centennial timescales at a Suoyang Ancient City, located in semi-arid northwest China. The modelled risk of deterioration is in good agreement with deterioration patterns found at Suoyang, with the risk of polishing predominantly occurring around the wall edges, areas at risk of pitting echoing the dune formation and the risk of slurry occurring in drape-like patterns down the wall face. Consequently, ViSTA-HD is a powerful and versatile model that can be used to help inform our understandings of long-term interactions between dryland processes and deteriorative impact on earthen structures.

The water opossum (Chironectes minimus), the only marsupial adapted for semi-aquatic life, occurs from Mexico to Argentina and it has been mostly described as a sensitive species to river and riparian vegetation degradation, occurring exclusively near water curses. Here we describe the first record of long-distance movement of a water opossum not associated with riverine vegetation through dry land. We captured a healthy adult male of C. minimus in July 2012 beside of a highway (DF-001) located 1,100 m from nearest gallery forest in the Federal District. The region is characterized by urban and suburban residential, small fragments of typical savanna and degraded gallery forests. Our unique record could be an event of dispersion through degraded dry lands as observed for other semi-aquatic mammals and also suggests that this species is more resistant to anthropogenic disturbances than previously described. Also, information about dispersal patterns of water opossum is scarce and may contributes to a deeper understanding of ecological requirements of this species.

J	Espinoza, S; Ovalle, C; del Pozo, A				Espinoza, Soledad; Ovalle, Carlos; del Pozo, Alejandro			The contribution of nitrogen fixed by annual legume pastures to the productivity of wheat in two contrasting Mediterranean environments in central Chile	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Annual legume pastures exhibit high resilience and productivity in Mediterranean climate regions and can be an important source of nitrogen (N) for temperate cereals in integrated livestock production systems. This work seeks to evaluate the inputs of N fixed by annual legume mixtures (composed of 3-4 species and cultivars) grown for one, two or three years in a cropping sequence, and their contribution to soil N availability, N uptake and the grain yield of wheat, and compares this with the cereal rotation of oats and wheat with and without N fertilizer. Two field experiments comprising annual legume-wheat rotations were carried out in two contrasting Mediterranean environments in central Chile, the interior dryland in the eastern part of the coastal mountain rage, and the Andean foothills, over four growing seasons (2008-2011). At both experimental sites two mixtures of annual legumes were used in rotation with wheat. The duration of the pasture phase was between one and three years. In the interior dryland, the shoot DM of mixture M1 (T. subterraneum + M. polymorpha + T. michelianum) was higher than M2 (T. subterraneum + B. penicilius + O. compressus), and in the Andean foothills M4 (T. subterraneum + T. vesiculosum + O. compressus) was more productive than M3 (two cv. of T. subterraneum + T. incarnatum). The amount of N-2 fixed by the legume mixtures, estimated by the N-15 natural abundance technique, ranged between 28 and 87 kg N ha(-1) in the interior dryland, and between 176 and 385 kg N ha(-1) in the Andean foothills, representing respectively around 25 and 23 kg N ha(-1) fixed for every Mg of shoot DM accumulated by the annual legumes. Wheat grain yields following legume mixtures represented 53-104 % of the 3.39 Mg ha(-1) produced after oats with N fertilizer in the interior dryland, and between 68 and 101 % of 6 Mg ha(-1) attained after oats in the Andean foothills, in 2011. N use efficiency (NUE) of wheat was significantly (P <= 0.05) higher in legume-based crop rotation than after oats with or without N fertilizer, at both sites. Legume mixtures also improved the N uptake (NUPE) and N utilization (NUtE) efficiencies of wheat compared to those observed after oats with N fertilizer, at both sites. Important differences among legume mixtures and the duration of the pasture phase were observed at both sites.

Establishing the spatial pattern of ecosystem multifunctionality, maximum height and the correlation of biodiversity patterns with climate change is important for understanding changes in complex ecosystem processes. However, the understanding of their relationships across large spatial areas remains limited in drylands.MethodsAccordingly, this study examined the spatial patterns of ecosystem multifunctionality, maximum height and considered a set of potential environmental drivers by investigating natural shrub communities in Northwest China.ResultsWe found that the ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) and maximum height of shrub communities were both affected by longitude, which was positively correlated with the precipitation gradient. Specifically, the EMF was driven by high precipitation seasonality, and the maximum height was driven by high precipitation stability during the growing season. Among the multiple biodiversity predictors, species beta diversity (SD-beta) is the most common in determining EMF, although this relationship is weak.DiscussionUnlike tree life form, we did not observe biodiversity-maximum height relationships in shrub communities. Based on these results, we suggest that more attention should be paid to the climatical fluctuations mediated biodiversity mechanisms, which are tightly correlated with ecosystem's service capacity and resistance capacity under a rapid climate change scenario in the future.

Agroforestry is considered climate-smart and can help buffer the effects of extreme climates. However, it remains unclear as to how trees in agroforestry physiologically adapt to prolonged drought in semiarid regions. Here, we report results from a three-year rainfall exclusion experiment (an extreme natural drought occurred during the experiment) designed to understand the physiological mechanism of young apple trees responding to different degrees of prolonged drought (moderate drought by reducing rainfall by 15% and severe drought by reducing rainfall by 25%) in an alley agroforestry system constituting of apple trees and oil crops. We found that the measured physiological traits for young apple tree under agroforestry were not clearly different from those under monoculture, although soil water content in the top 80 cm was reduced by 9.3%. Under moderate drought conditions, the apple trees in agroforestry implemented a conservative water-use strategy. Stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, and leaf transpiration were reduced by 15.5%, 3.8%, and 12.6%, respectively, whereas pre-dawn (psi pd) and midday (psi md) leaf water potential stabilized, indicating a clear isohydric behavior. Under severe drought conditions, however, the apple trees still maintained normal stomatal opening to significantly (p<0.01) increase photosynthesis (9.8%) and leaf transpiration (12%) at the expense of reducing psi pd (58.1%) and psi md (25.4%), showing anisohydric behavior which can place apple trees at risk. Reduction of aboveground biomass and greater numbers of fine roots in deeper soils to explore deep-layer soil water could explain such risky behavior by apple trees suffering severe drought. The findings here provide new insights into the mechanism through which the coordination between canopy water consumption and above-ground/belowground biomass redistribution of trees underpin the physiological adaptation of trees to different degrees of prolonged drought in semiarid regions.

Thus, quantifying interception loss is essential for thoroughly understanding the role of vegetation in the local hydrological cycle, especially in dryland ecosystems. However, sparse shrubs in dryland ecosystems have not been sufficiently studied, owing to time- and labor-intensive field experiments and challenging model parameterization. In this work, 4-year growing season field experiments on rainfall partitioning were conducted for three dominant shrub species (Haloxylon ammodendron, Nitraria sphaerocarpa, and Calligonum mongolicum) in an oasis-desert ecotone in northwestern China. The revised Gash analytical model was well parameterized, which reliably simulated the cumulative interception loss for sparse shrubs, and the validated model performed better for H. ammodendron, followed by C. mongolicum and N. sphaerocarpa, with relative errors of 8.4%, 15.4%, and 23.9%, respectively. The mean individual interception loss percentage for H. ammodendron (28.4%) was significantly higher than that for C. mongolicum (11.0%) and N. sphaerocarpa (10.9%) (p < 0.05), which could be ascribed to the higher canopy storage capacity and wet-canopy evaporation rate of H. ammodendron. For all shrub species, the majority proportion of interception loss occurred during canopy saturation and drying-out periods, accounting for approximately 79-85% of the cumulative interception loss. Overall, the mean local interception loss of three dominant shrub species in the ecotone removed nearly 17% of the corresponding cumulative rainfall during the growing season. These results not only provide methodological references for estimating the interception loss of sparse vegetation in dryland ecosystems, but also provide scientific insights for water resource management and ecosystem restoration in water-limited regions similar to the experimental site.

J	Han, Y; Zhao, WW; Zhou, A; Pereira, P				Han, Yi; Zhao, Wenwu; Zhou, Ao; Pereira, Paulo			Water and wind erosion response to ecological restoration measures in China's drylands	GEODERMA												Soil erosion is the most severe form of land degradation threatening terrestrial ecosystems globally. Drylands with fragile ecosystems are particularly sensitive to soil erosion. China's drylands face the threat of soil erosion by wind and water. Currently, more studies need to be focused on wind and water erosion response to ecological restoration measures at monthly resolution in these areas. This is key to understanding ecological restoration measures' effectiveness under changing environments. Here, we assessed the monthly water and wind erosion in China's drylands from 2001 to 2020 using the G2 model and revised wind erosion equation (RWEQ). The Sequential linear regression slopes (SeRGS) explored water and wind erosion intensities. We also discuss the mitigation benefits of two ecological restoration measures, afforestation and grassland restoration. The results showed that water and wind erosion in China's drylands is mild (47.35%) and slight (58.76%). Water erosion increased between 2001 and 2020, while wind erosion decreased. At the monthly level, a higher water and wind erosion rate occurred from April to June and February to March, respectively. Water erosion dominated 50.64% of the China's drylands, while wind erosion was the most critical form of erosion in 47.88%. Nevertheless, the erosion pattern in China's drylands is changing. The average mitigation benefits of afforestation on water and wind erosion were -61.12% and -57.05%, respectively, and the average mitigation benefits of grassland restoration on water and wind erosion were -57.05% and 7.95%, respectively. This study can help managers identify the best ecological restoration strategies to mitigate land degradation in drylands.

Previous surveys of Fusarium species causing FHB identified isolates using morphological characters only. This study reports on a comprehensive characterisation of FHB pathogens conducted in 2008 and 2009. Symptomatic wheat heads were collected from the Northern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), Bushveld and eastern Free State (irrigation regions), and from one field in the Western Cape (dryland region). Fusarium isolates were identified with species-specific primers or analysis of partial EF-1 alpha sequences. A representative subset of isolates was characterized morphologically. In total, 1047 Fusarium isolates were collected, comprising 24 species from seven broad species complexes. The F. sambucinum (FSAMSC) and F. incarnatum-equiseti species complexes (FIESC) were most common (83.5% and 13.3% of isolates, respectively). The F. chlamydosporum (FCSC), F. fujikuroi (FFSC), F. oxysporum (FOSC), F. solani (FSSC), and F. tricinctum species complexes (FTSC) were also observed. Within the FSAMSC, 90.7% of isolates belonged to the F. graminearum species complex (FGSC), accounting for 75.7% of isolates. The FGSC was the dominant Fusaria in all four irrigation regions. F. pseudograminearum dominated at the dryland field in the Western Cape. The Northern Cape had the highest species diversity (16 Fusarium species from all seven species complexes). The type B trichothecene chemotype of FGSC and related species was inferred with PCR. Chemotype diversity was limited (15-ADON = 90.1%) and highly structured in relation to species differences. These results expand the known species diversity associated with FHB in South Africa and include first reports of F. acuminatum, F. armeniacum, F. avenaceum, F. temperatum, and F. pseudograminearum from wheat heads in South Africa, and of F. brachygibbosum, F. lunulosporum and F. transvaalense from wheat globally. Potentially novel species were identified within the FCSC, FFSC, FOSC, FSAMSC, FIESC and FTSC.

Le			Long-term water quality assessments under changing land use in a large semi-arid catchment in South Africa	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Increasing nutrient loads from land use and land cover (LULC) change degrade water quality through eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems globally. The Vaal River Catchment in South Africa is an agriculturally and economically important area where eutrophication has been a problem for decades. Effective mitigation strategies of eutrophication in this re-gion require an understanding of the relationship between LULC change and water quality. This study assessed the long-term impacts of LULC changes on nitrate (NO3-N) and orthophosphate (PO4-P) pollution in the lower Vaal River Catchment between 1980 and 2018. Multi-year LULC was mapped from Landsat imagery and changes were de-termined. Long-term trends in NO3-N and PO4-P loads and concentrations in river water samples were analysed, while multi-year LULC data were ingested into the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate the impacts of LULC changes in NO3-N and PO4-P loads. Main LULC changes included an increase in the irrigated area by 262% and in built -up area by 33%. This occurred at the expense of cultivated dryland fields and rangelands. In situ data analysis showed that at the catchment inlet, PO4-P concentration and loads significantly increased, while NO3-N concentration and loads decreased between 1980 and 2018. At the catchment outlet, only PO4-P loads increased, while NO3-N loads and concentrations remained the same. SWAT simulations at the Hydrologic Response Unit scale showed that irrigated land was the largest contributor to NO3-N leaching per ha. Aggregation of nutrient loads by LULC type showed in-creased nutrient loads from irrigated and built-up areas over time, while loads from dryland areas decreased. At catchment scale, dryland remained an important contributor of the annual nutrient loads total because of its large area. In future, research efforts should focus on crop management practices to reduce nutrient loads.

This is especially true for the continent's hyperarid, arid, semiarid, and dry subhumid zones, collectively known as drylands, which are under-represented ecosystems that are highly threatened by climate change and human activity. Maps of LULC in drylands are, thus, essential in order to investigate their vulnerability to both natural and anthropogenic impacts. This paper comprehensively reviewed existing mapping initiatives of South America's drylands to discuss the main knowledge gaps, as well as central methodological trends and challenges, for advancing our understanding of LULC dynamics in these fragile ecosystems. Our review centered on five essential aspects of remote-sensing-based LULC mapping: scale, datasets, classification techniques, number of classes (legends), and validation protocols. The results indicated that the Landsat sensor dataset was the most frequently used, followed by AVHRR and MODIS, and no studies used recently available high-resolution satellite sensors. Machine learning algorithms emerged as a broadly employed methodology for land cover classification in South America. Still, such advancement in classification methods did not yet reflect in the upsurge of detailed mapping of dryland vegetation types and functional groups. Among the 23 mapping initiatives, the number of LULC classes in their respective legends varied from 6 to 39, with 1 to 14 classes representing drylands. Validation protocols included fieldwork and automatic processes with sampling strategies ranging from solely random to stratified approaches. Finally, we discussed the opportunities and challenges for advancing research on desertification, climate change, fire mapping, and the resilience of dryland populations. By and large, multi-level studies for dryland vegetation mapping are still lacking.

A better understanding of the implications of climate-induced changes in the drylands for C sink-source dynamics is urgently needed. The effect of climate on ecosystem C fluxes (gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and net ecosystem productivity (NEP)) in drylands has been extensively explored, but the roles of other concurrently changing factors, such as vegetation conditions and nutrient availability, remain unclear. We used eddy-covariance C-flux measurements from 45 ecosystems with concurrent information on climate (mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP)), soil (soil moisture (SM) and soil total nitrogen content (soil N)), and vegetation (leaf area index (LAI) and leaf nitrogen content (LNC)) factors to assess their roles in C fluxes. The results showed that the drylands in China were weak C sinks. GPP and ER were positively correlated with MAP, while they were negatively correlated with MAT. NEP first decreased and then increased with increasing MAT and MAP, and 6.6 degrees C and 207 mm were the boundaries for the NEP response to MAT and MAP, respectively. SM, soil N, LAI, and MAP were the main factors affecting GPP and ER. However, SM and LNC had the most important influence on NEP. Compared with climate and vegetation factors, soil factors (SM and soil N) had a greater impact on C fluxes in the drylands. Climate factors mainly affected C fluxes by regulating vegetation and soil factors. To accurately estimate the global C balance and predict the response of ecosystems to environmental change, it is necessary to fully consider the discrepant effects of climate, vegetation, and soil factors on C fluxes, as well as the cascade relationships between different factors.

A classification scheme for sedimentary architectures arising from aeolian-fluvial system interactions: Permian examples from southeast Utah, USA	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												The preservation of the sedimentary deposits of arid environments is determined by both geomorphic and geologic processes. Sedimentary evidence of aeolian-fluvial system interactions in arid-climate settings are preserved in both recent and ancient sedimentary successions. However, despite considerable prior sedimento-logical research, there is no unifying scheme to provide generalized definitions of commonly occurring types of preserved aeolian-fluvial interactions. This study addresses this shortcoming by introducing a novel classification scheme for sedimentary architectures arising from such system interactions. The scheme is demonstrated through reference to examples from the Permian Cutler Group, Paradox Basin, Southeast Utah, USA - a sedimentary record of competing aeolian dune-field and fluvial-fan systems along a palaeo-coastline. Well-preserved, laterally continuous outcrops arranged in different orientations enable three-dimensional architectural characterization. The sedimentary record of eight distinct types of aeolian-fluvial interaction are identified: (i) water-table -controlled interdune sedimentation; (ii) deposits of low-energy fluvial floods; (iii) isolated fluvial channel-fills originating from episodic and confined flooding of interdunes in orientations parallel to the trend of dune crestlines; (iv) channel fills oriented perpendicular to the trend of dune crestlines; (v) amalgamated fluvial channel elements resulting from persistent, long-lived but confined dune-field flooding; (vi) deposits of uncon-fined sheet-like flood deposits; (vii) fluvial breaching of dunes and their reworking by catastrophic flooding; (viii) aeolian reworking of fluvial deposits. Each interaction type is characterized in terms of preserved sedi-mentary facies, architectural element geometries and associated proprieties, to demonstrate sedimentary vari-ability in three dimensions. Results provide a guide with which to make sedimentological comparisons and interpretations between active systems and their preserved depositional record.

Near-surface pedosediments of Takatokwane saline pan, southern Botswana: Properties, pedogenic processes, and inferences of environmental change	GEODERMA REGIONAL												Natural pans are an important feature of dry landscapes worldwide. The purpose of this study was to characterize, for the first time, the near-surface pedosediments of the prominent Takatokwane pan in southern Botswana using their physical, geochemical, and mineralogical properties, to explore past and active pedogenic processes, and to interpret the properties of the pedosediments in light of environmental change. Pedogenic parameters including particle size distribution, reaction, electrical conductivity, and organic matter content were determined using routine laboratory procedures. The total elemental composition was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The clay mineralogical compositions of the pedosediments were determined using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer. A suite of geochemical coefficients was used to quantify the weathering and pedogenic processes. Granulometric analysis showed that the pedosediments were dominated by fine sand (380 - 890 g/kg). The two pedons were greenish-gray in color at a depth of 140 cm. The elemental abundances followed the order of SiO2 > Al2O3 > Fe2O3 > TiO2. The TiO2/Al2O3 coupled with mineralogy indicated a uniform origin of the parent materials and feldspathic sandstone components, which were redeposited in the pan environment. The geochemical weathering coefficient indicates incipient weathering. Smectite-enriched clay deposits in the basin paved the way for the formation of the vertical layers. At the meso-morphological scale, reworked pedofeatures indicative of clay illuviation and gleisation processes were observed. The dominant pedogenic processes in soils include hydrolysis, lessivage, illuviation, and gleisation. This set of processes indicates the cycles of humid pedogenesis. This study confirmed three cycles of deposition, chemical precipitation, and post-depositional alteration under changing environmental conditions. Evidence from this study points to the seasonality of the environment, which could be explored for an improved understanding of the evolution of the Takatokwane pan and the Kalahari Basin.

MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Microcrustacea in ephemeral wetlands produce dormant eggs to escape prolonged dry conditions. These eggs can hatch on inundation, although in most cases not all eggs hatch during a single wetting event. Incomplete hatching can reflect bet-hedging strategies, but also the presence or absence of environmental cues that stimulate hatching. This study examines the effects of environmental cues likely to change for wetlands in the future, namely, temperature and water depth. Surface sediments collected from dry anabranches of the Macintyre River floodplain (eastern Australia) were inundated under two temperature regimes (warm and cool) in microcosms of two depths (shallow and deep). Hatched microcrustacea were sampled for 6 weeks. The abundance and assemblage composition of microcrustacea varied by temperature but not by depth. Although the total abundance was greater under warm conditions, the effect of temperature diminished over time. Temperature also had a greater effect on non-ostracods, with 144% more non-ostracods being hatched under warm than under cool conditions. Thus, changes to temperature during inundation periods arising from global climate change or river regulation are likely to influence the abundance and composition of microcrustacean assemblages, especially among non-ostracods, which will influence food availability for larval and juvenile native fish and, hence, recruitment.

Genomic signatures for drylands adaptation at gene-rich regions in African zebu cattle	GENOMICS												Background:Indigenous Sudanese cattle are mainly indicine/zebu (humped) type. They thrive in the harshest dryland environments characterised by high temperatures, long seasonal dry periods, nutritional shortages, and vector disease challenges. Here, we sequenced 60 indigenous Sudanese cattle from six indigenous breeds and analysed the data using three genomic scan approaches to unravel cattle adaptation to the African dryland region. Results:We identified a set of gene-rich selective sweep regions, detected mostly on chromosomes 5, 7 and 19, shared across African and Gir zebu. These include genes involved in immune response, body size and conformation, and heat stress response. We also identified selective sweep regions unique to Sudanese zebu. Of these, a 250 kb selective sweep on chromosome 16 spans seven genes, including PLCH2, PEX10, PRKCZ, and SKI, which are involved in alternative adaptive metabolic strategies of insulin signalling, glucose homeostasis, and fat metabolism. Conclusions:Our results suggest that environmental adaptation may involve recent and ancient selection at generich regions, which might be under a common regulatory genetic control, in zebu cattle.

Understanding climate change and its impact drivers on dryland is essential for supporting dryland planning and sustainable development. Using meteorological observations for 1960-2019, the aridity changes in drylands of China were evaluated using aridity index (AI), and the impact of various climatic factors [i.e., precipitation P; sunshine duration (SSD); relative humidity (RH); maximum temperature (Tmax); minimum temperature (Tmin); wind speed (WS)] on the aridity changes was decomposed and quantified. Results of trend analysis based on Sen's slope estimator and Mann-Kendall test indicated that the aridity trends were very weak when averaged over the whole drylands in China during 1960-2019 but exhibited a significant wetting trend in hyperarid and arid regions of drylands. The AI was most sensitive to changes in water factors (i.e., P and RH), followed by SSD, Tmax, and WS, but the sensitivity of AI to Tmin was very small and negligible. Interestingly, the dominant climatic driver to AI change varied in the four dryland subtypes. The significantly increased P dominated the increase in AI in the hyperarid and arid regions. The significantly reduced WS and the significantly increased Tmax contributed more to AI changes than the P in the semiarid and dry subhumid regions of drylands. Previous studies emphasized the impact of precipitation and temperature on the global or regional dry-wet changes; however, the findings of this study suggest that, beyond precipitation and temperature, the impact of wind speed on aridity changes of drylands in China should be given equal attention.																			1558-8424	1558-8432				APR	2021	60	4					607	617		10.1175/JAMC-D-20-0209.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-20-0209.1													WOS:000644122400012
J	Xu, S				Xu, Shan			Temporal and Spatial Characteristics of the Change of Cultivated Land Resources in the Black Soil Region of Heilongjiang Province (China)	SUSTAINABILITY												It is of great significance for the improvement of grain production capacity and the protection of cultivated land in the Black Soil Region to reveal the temporal and spatial evolution trend of the change in cultivated land resources. In this paper, the temporal and spatial variation pattern of cultivated land resources in Heilongjiang Province was analyzed based on the remote sensing images made in 1995, 2005, and 2015 with the 3S Technology by using the land use dynamic degree, kernel density analysis, and transfer matrix methods. The results showed that, during the two decades from 1995 to 2015, the total quantity of cultivated land increased slightly. To be specific, in 1995-2005, the total quantity of cultivated land increased; in 2005-2015, the number decreased. Spatially, the conversion of cultivated land was mainly concentrated in the west of Heilongjiang Province. During the study period, the high-density cultivated land area was concentrated in the west of Heilongjiang Province, and the largest increase came in Heihe City and Qitaihe City. The conversion between each land type and cultivated land was observed. The internal conversion of cultivated land was between dryland and paddy field. The transfer-out of cultivated land was mainly the conversion of dryland into construction land and woodland, and the transfer-in was mainly the conversion of woodland, unused land, and construction land into dryland, while only a small quantity of conversion involving paddy field was found. Spatially, the conversion mainly took place in Harbin City, Heihe City, and Suihua City in the center and west of Heilongjiang Province, and also in a moderate amount in Qiqihar City in the east of Heilongjiang Province.																			2071-1050					JAN 1	2019	11	1							38	10.3390/su11010038	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11010038													WOS:000457127300038

Although continental maps of groundwater storage and recharge have been developed, we currently lack a clear understanding on how the controls on groundwater recharge vary across the entire continent. Reviewing the existing literature, we synthesize information on reported groundwater recharge controls in Africa. We find that 15 out of 22 of these controls can be characterised using global datasets. We develop 11 descriptors of climatic, topographic, vegetation, soil and geologic properties using global datasets, to characterise groundwater recharge controls in Africa. These descriptors cluster Africa into 15 Recharge Landscape Units for which we expect recharge controls to be similar. Over 80% of the continents land area is organized by just nine of these units. We also find that aggregating the Units by similarity into four broader Recharge Landscapes (Desert, Dryland, Wet tropical and Wet tropical forest) provides a suitable level of landscape organisation to explain differences in ground-based long-term mean annual recharge and recharge ratio (annual recharge / annual precipitation) estimates. Furthermore, wetter Recharge Landscapes are more efficient in converting rainfall to recharge than drier Recharge Landscapes as well as having higher annual recharge rates. In Dryland Recharge Landscapes, we found that annual recharge rates largely varied according to mean annual precipitation, whereas recharge ratio estimates increase with increasing monthly variability in P-PET. However, we were unable to explain why ground based estimates of recharge signatures vary across other Recharge Landscapes, in which there are fewer ground based recharge estimates, using global datasets alone. Even in dryland regions, there is still considerable unexplained variability in the estimates of annual recharge and recharge ratio, stressing the limitations of global datasets for investigating ground-based information.

Irrigation must be carefully managed to limit unnecessary water use while ensuring maximum economic productivity. To better understand the costs and net returns of irrigation and cultivar selection, field experiments were conducted in 2016 and 2017 to compare cotton lint yield and fiber quality in dryland plots and plots irrigated using the University of Georgia checkbook method (UGA Checkbook) at a field site near Camilla, Georgia. Results showed cultivar differences in fiber quality parameters of micronaire and uniformity in 2016, but there was no cultivar difference in fiber quality in 2017. Cultivar differences were not observed in yield or net returns for both years. However, stoplight chart analysis of net returns indicated differences in cultivar selection for irrigated or dryland production. ST 6182 GLB2 would be a better option for a producer to minimize downside risk under dryland conditions, and PHY 333 WRF would be a better option under irrigated production. Results also indicated that broadly applying simplistic water balance approaches could decrease yield, water productivity, and net returns, especially in environments where rainfall is sufficient yet unpredictable. Over-irrigation affected some fiber quality parameters but did not impact the overall market price for cotton. In 2016, irrigating according to the UGA Checkbook method negatively impacted yield and net returns. In 2017, irrigation did not affect yield but negatively impacted net returns. Average losses in net returns associated with excessive irrigation in these two wet years were $336 per hectare for net return over irrigation variable costs, and $645 per hectare for net return over irrigation total costs. Implementing robust, efficient irrigation strategies is necessary to achieve high cotton yields, reduce water usage, and improve economic returns.

Fourteen scenarios were simulated including alternative irrigation application depths of 12.7 mm and 38.1 mm for irrigated corn, sorghum, and wheat and with different planting dates for irrigated corn, sorghum, wheat, and dryland wheat. Results indicated the greater irrigation depth (38.1 mm) led to reductions in seasonal irrigation requirements and crop evapotranspiration (ETc) when compared to the baseline scenarios using an irrigation depth of 25.4 mm for corn, sorghum, and wheat. However, soil water content, surface runoff, and percolation were increased. The opposite was observed for simulations of the same hydrologic variables but with an irrigation depth of 12.7 mm. Crop yields associated with the alternative irrigation depths were similar to those achieved with the baseline. Delayed planting of corn and sorghum resulted in the decrease of all the studied hydrologic parameters relative to the baseline. By contrast, the early planting scenarios showed the increase in those variables generally. Simulated corn yields were relatively stable, but a 3.7% reduction in irrigated sorghum yield was found with late planting. Notably, the early planting of wheat resulted in a clear increase in both irrigated and dryland yields of 11.2% and 13.5%, respectively. However, the yields of irrigated and dryland wheat were reduced by 28.8% and 2.7%, respectively, for the late planting. These findings suggest the greater irrigation application depth is promising for maintaining crop yields and reducing groundwater use from the Ogallala Aquifer. Also, the late planting of corn may benefit water conservation. Nevertheless, the early planting of wheat might be warranted to enhance yield in the THP.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				FEB 1	2021	244								106574	10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106574	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106574													WOS:000603305400007

Understanding the temporal variability and disturbance in palatable species in grasslands is a key issue in nature conservation and human economy. In this study, we examined plant trait responses to climate and grazing variability in semi-arid grasslands of Mongolia. Ungrazed exclosure areas were established in two nomadically grazed grasslands, Bayan-Unjuul (BU) in 2004 and Baganuur (BN) in 2016. Plant aboveground biomass (AGB) was surveyed by species inside and outside the exclosures. Plant species were classified into 11 groups on the basis of palatability, life duration, and functional type. Data on air temperature and precipitation were obtained from weather observatories, and the number of livestock was monitored by using time-lapse cameras since 2016 at BU and BN. Analysis of temporal variation from 2004 to 2019 in the ungrazed plot at BU indicated that the aridity index, which was closely correlated with precipitation, in JuneeJuly of the current year affected the AGB of both palatable and unpalatable species. Rainfall intensity in June contributed to the increase in AGB of palatable plants, in particular perennial grasses. Previous years' aridity affected the current-year AGB, which is known as the "legacy effect". The legacy effect was positive on perennial grasses and forbs and negative on annual forbs, resulting in a positive effect on the ratio of AGB of palatable species to total AGB. The increase in livestock numbers in summer decreased the ratio of AGB of palatable plants in the grazed plots to that in the ungrazed plots, and increased this ratio of annual forbs and unpalatable perennial shrubs. A multiple regression model showed that AGB of palatable plants in the grazed areas was controlled primarily by rainfall intensity in June of the current year and secondarily by livestock number in summer.

Measurement of lime movement and dissolution in acidic soils using mid-infrared spectroscopy	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Acidification of surface and sub-surface soils limits agricultural production globally. Conventional surface application of lime is the most common amelioration approach for surface acidity. However, amelioration of subsurface acidity is challenging to achieve using this approach. Testing the efficacy of liming to treat acidity through the soil profile via the measurement of lime movement requires high throughput information about soil properties at a high spatial resolution, which can be time consuming and expensive using traditional laboratory analysis. Here, we investigated the potential of Mid Infrared (MIR) spectroscopy as a tool to monitor lime dissolution and vertical movement through soils at high spatial resolution. Soil samples were collected at 2.5 cm intervals to 20 cm depth at three trial sites in South Australia, with various lime treatments applied either 6 years or 1 year prior to sampling. MIR Partial least squares regression (PLSR) predictions were undertaken to measure lime dissolution and alkalinity movement via soil pH, and undissolved lime presence via soil carbonate concentrations. Lime balance calculations were then performed to determine the fate of applied lime and assess efficacy of various rates of lime products applied at the surface only or via incorporation. MIR-PLSR prediction model performance was strong for both soil pH (R2 = 0.923 and RMSE = 0.202) and carbonate (R2 =0.829 and RMSE=0.042 CO3%). Results indicated the movement of alkalinity at all sites was limited, and revealed increased movement at the longer-term (-6 years) vs shorter-term (-1 year) sites where lime was surface applied. Lime balance calculations indicated that residual lime remained in the top 7.5 cm of the soil profile while soils remained acidic below this depth. Findings suggest that incorporation of residual lime and additional lime applications may be necessary to remediate sub-surface acidity. A decision tree was developed to inform management of surface and sub-surface soil acidity. The study validates the potential of MIR spectroscopy to measure and monitor the effectiveness and movement of lime with improved resolution in acidic soils.																			0167-1987	1879-3444				SEP	2023	233								105807	10.1016/j.still.2023.105807	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2023.105807		JUN 2023											WOS:001035335500001

The rice agroecosystem, the main engine of the agricultural economy, involves its own components that are indicators of sustainability and productivity, where the chemical properties of the soils constitute an important factor for the profitability of the rice company.Objective: To carry out a chemical characterization of the mechanized rainfed rice soils of Majagual-Sucre, under two topographical conditions (low and high).Method: 32 soil samples were taken and the following were evaluated: pH, organic matter (OM), phosphorous and available cations, cation exchange capacity and microelements. Descriptive statistics, principal component analysis (PCA), and Ward's minimum variance clusters were used.Results: For both topographies, the pH was slightly acid, OM, phosphorus, potassium, sodium and boron low. In the high topography, a higher content of sulfur, iron, and zinc was recorded, and in the low topography, a higher concentration of calcium, magnesium, CIC, and manganese was recorded. PCA led to a reduction of the initial dimensions from 14 to 4, which accumulated the total explained variance of the extraction of the 4 components with 71.63%.Conclusions: The concentrations of nutrients in the soils cultivated with rice in the La Mojana subregion were identified, which are a guide in the fertilization plans according to the topographic conditions of the plots.																			0122-6517	2382-4700				JUL-DEC	2022	18	2								10.17981/ingecuc.18.2.2022.10	http://dx.doi.org/10.17981/ingecuc.18.2.2022.10													WOS:000917298600006

Some regions in particular, have shown upward trends in the observational records of precipitation. However, there is more to drying and wetting than just changes in precipitation which still have large uncertainties. Coherent results, however, can be obtained, at the regional scale, with the use of multiple indices as shown in the recent literature. We divided the drylands of China into three sub-regions, i.e., a semi-arid (SA), an eastern-arid (EA) and a western-arid (WA) region. Precipitation from the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) and Climatic Research Unit (CRU), statistical and physical drought indices, including the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), self-calibrating PDSI (sc PDSI), Root zone soil moisture (Root sm) and Surface soil moisture (Surf sm) from Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were used to identify temporal and spatial patterns in drying and wetting. Data were selected from 1982-2012, in line with the availability of the remotely sensed vegetation data. Results show that the drylands of China exhibits a pattern of wetting in the west and drying in the east. The semi-arid region in the east is becoming drier and the drought area is increasing, with the values of CMA P, CRU P, PDSI, sc PDSI, SPEI-01,SPEI-06, SPEI-12, Root sm, Surf sm at - 1.064 mm yr(-1),-0.834 mm yr(-1),-0.050 yr(-1) (p < 0.1),-0.174 yr(-1) (p < 0.1),-0.014 yr(-1),-0.06, - 0.021 (p < 0.1),-0.257x10(-3) m(3) M-3 yr(-1),-0.024x10(-3) m(3) M-3 yr(-1), respectively. The arid region generally exhibits a wetting trend, while the area in drought declines only in the western arid region, but not in the eastern arid part. In the semi-arid region, growing season (May to September) NDVI is significantly correlated (p < 0.1) with eight out of nine indicators. We show in this study that the semi-arid region needs more study to protect the vegetation ecosystem and the water resources.

This study aimed to assess the de-terminants of household participation in dry forest product collection and its contribution to the household economy in Jawi district. The primary data were collected from 259 randomly selected households. The determinant factors affecting household participation in dry forest product (gum and resin) collection and the level of revenue from gum and resin were evaluated using a Heckman 2-stage selection model. According to the findings of this survey, dry forest revenue accounts for 23.69% of the total annual household income. Our findings reveal that age, proximity to the forest, distance to the market, participatory forest management (PFM) membership, frequency of forest extension, and poor wealth status have a substantial impact on a household's engagement in dry forest product collection and the level of income generated from engagement in dry forest product collection. Policies and strategies aimed at improving the well-being of households in the country's dry forest areas should focus on the market development of resources to boost the income of local people.

J	Mccoy, MD; Panuska, JL				Mccoy, Mark D.; Panuska, Joseph L.			Visible Wealth in Past Societies: A Case Study of Domestic Architecture from the Hawaiian Islands	CAMBRIDGE ARCHAEOLOGICAL JOURNAL												Domestic architecture is increasingly revisited as a source of data about wealth inequality in the distant past via the Gini coefficient, a statistical tool often used in economics to compare income inequality. Many areas-including South America, Africa, South Asia and Oceania-remain under-sampled, making it difficult to develop a more complete picture of ancient political economies. In this paper we present a first look at this measure in the Hawaiian Islands. These data show that during the period prior to contact with Europeans inequality was extremely high, most similar to autocratic archaic states. We also found geographic patterning that may ultimately be linked to dryland (non-irrigated) farming. On islands reliant on dryland farming (Mau'i, Hawai'i), we find distinctively less inequality than elsewhere, or larger house sizes. We hypothesize these may have been innovations in how wealth was made visible to create and maintain cooperation in places where more labour would have been required to grow surplus. More research is necessary to test this hypothesis, investigate alternative interpretations, and to put these findings in larger regional context within Polynesia.

The response of abundant and rare bacteria in desertified land to restoration is still unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of vegetation restoration on the assemblage patterns of abundant and rare bacteria in soil across the four sandy lands (Hulunbeir, Horqin, Otindag, and Mu Us) in northern China. Our results revealed that abundant bacteria maintained a relatively stable state under restoration, whereas rare taxa were more responsive, indicating the higher resilience of the rare community to change. Our network analysis also showed that restoration promoted destabilizing properties in rare, but not in abundant, bacterial co-occurrence networks in soil. Environmental selection played a key role in abundant and rare community assembly under restoration. Of the two, the rare subcommunity was mainly affected by environmental filtering. The variations in the abundant and rare communities at the sampling sites under restoration were controlled mainly by plant species richness, and stronger effects were observed in the rare taxa. Overall, these results provide new insight into the mechanisms controlling bacterial community assembly in response to vegetation restoration.

In this study, the effect of the placement of plastic mulch on the furrows and/or on the ridges on reducing water loss and nitrate leaching for furrow-fertigated maize was investigated. Field experiments were carried out including four different treatments which differed according to the placement of plastic mulch on a clay loam soil: plastic mulch on the ridge, plastic mulch on the furrow bed, plastic mulch on the ridge and the furrow bed and control treatment without the mulch. The HYDRUS-2D model was used to simulate water movement and nitrate transfer within the soil. The HYDRUS-2D model was well calibrated and validated using field data. Three irrigation scenarios were also compared including 125, 100 and 75% of the crop water requirement. In the case of using mulch and full irrigation (i.e. 100% crop water requirement), nitrate losses compared to the control treatment with 25% over-irrigation decreased by 52, 44, and 30%, in the the treatments of mulch on the furrow bed, mulch on the ridge and mulch on the ridge and the furrow bed, respectively. Deep percolation of irrigation water also decreased by 53, 48, and 41%, respectively. The use of plastic mulch on the furrow bed with less irrigation depth could be used to prevent water and nitrate losses in furrow irrigation.

However, due to lacking accurate spatial distribution of straw return, few studies have carried out rigorous research on the impact of long-term straw return on SOM spatiotemporal variation on a regional scale. This study was carried out across an approximately 3000 km(2) area in Lishu County, northeastern China, a typical agricultural plain. Based on a total of 619 soil samples and 16 environmental covariates, the study mapped the spatial distributions of SOM in 2006 and 2018 by random forest (RF) and evaluated the effects of the interaction of soil properties, land use, and straw return on SOM spatial-temporal variation. The results show that in the context of long-term straw return, the mean SOM content increased from 18.93 to 20.84 g kg(-1) during 2006-2018. And 74.49 % of the region had a significant increase (maximum of 24.41 g kg(-1)) of SOM. The severest SOM loss occurred in the northwest due to the light texture and the transition from paddy fields to dryland. Nevertheless, for areas from paddy fields to dryland, the SOM loss decreased with the increased cumulative crop residue coverage (CRC). The SOM even increased by 1.79 g kg(-1) when the cumulative crop residue coverage reached 0.60-1.00. In addition, soil with higher initial SOM and sand content had a lower response to straw return. The study revealed that straw return is beneficial to carbon sink in farmland and is a better way to prevent a carbon source caused by the conservation of paddy field to dryland.

This is especially the case in naturally vulnerable ecosystems, such as drylands. While we have an overall understanding of past aridity trends, the linkage between temporal dynamics in aridity and dryland ecosystem responses remain largely unknown. Here, we examined recent trends in aridity over the past two decades within global drylands as a basis for exploring the response of ecosystem state variables associated with land and atmosphere processes (e.g., vegetation cover, vegetation functioning, soil water availability, land cover, burned area, and vapor-pressure deficit) to these trends. We identified five clusters, characterizing spatiotemporal patterns in aridity between 2000 and 2020. Overall, we observe that 44.5% of all areas are getting dryer, 31.6% getting wetter, and 23.8% have no trends in aridity. Our results show strongest correlations between trends in ecosystem state variables and aridity in clusters with increasing aridity, which matches expectations of systemic acclimatization of the ecosystem to a reduction in water availability/water stress. Trends in vegetation (expressed by leaf area index [LAI]) are affected differently by potential driving factors (e.g., environmental, and climatic factors, soil properties, and population density) in areas experiencing water-related stress as compared to areas not exposed to water-related stress. Canopy height for example, has a positive impact on trends in LAI when the system is stressed but does not impact the trends in non-stressed systems. Conversely, opposite relationships were found for soil parameters such as root-zone water storage capacity and organic carbon density. How potential driving factors impact dryland vegetation differently depending on water-related stress (or no stress) is important, for example within management strategies to maintain and restore dryland vegetation.

However, the driving factors regulating straw returning-induced SOC increase in China's uplands remain un-certain. This study conducted a meta-analysis by collecting data from 238 trials at 85 field sites. The results showed that straw returning significantly increased SOC content by an average of 16.1% +/- 1.5% with an average sequestration rate of 0.26 +/- 0.02 g kg(-1) yr(-1). The improvement effects were significantly better in the northern China (NE-NW-N) than in the eastern and central (E-C). SOC increases were more pronounced in C-rich and alkaline soils, in cold and dry climates, and under larger amounts of straw-C and moderate nitrogen fertilizer inputs. Longer experimental period resulted in higher SOC increase rates but lower SOC sequestration rates. Furthermore, partial correlation analysis and structural equation modelling revealed that total straw-C input was the key driving factor of SOC increase rate whereas straw returning duration was the dominant limiting factor of SOC sequestration rate across China. Climate conditions were potential limiting factors of SOC increase rate in NE-NW-N and SOC sequestration rate in E-C. It was suggested that straw returning with large application amounts should be more strongly recommended in uplands in NE-NW-N especially in the straw applications at the beginning, from the perspective of SOC sequestration.

However, most studies on the impacts of plant-plant interactions on biodiversity focus on species richness and to a lesser extent on other facets of diversity. When other facets of biodiversity are considered, studies often include a limited set of environmental conditions. We aimed to quantify the impacts of nurse plants on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic facets of plant biodiversity and how these impacts change across environmental gradients. Location We report data on 28 alpine and 50 dryland sites, established in 11 countries. Time period 1998-2019. Major taxa studied Vascular plants. Methods We analysed plant-plant interactions using co-occurrence analyses and obtained information on the functional traits and phylogenetic relationships of the beneficiary species. We calculated the change in taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity caused by the presence of nurse plants and environmental conditions. Results Nurse plants enhanced taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity in alpine communities and enhanced functional and phylogenetic diversity in dryland communities. However, they had a positive effect on functional and taxonomic diversity only in moderate environments in alpine and dryland communities, respectively. The effects of nurse plants were larger in drylands for functional and phylogenetic diversity and in alpine communities for taxonomic diversity. Interestingly, nurse plants induced nonlinear changes in all facets of biodiversity across environmental gradients, whereas biodiversity tended to increase linearly toward more benign conditions in open interspaces. Main conclusions Facilitation is important in alpine environments to maximize taxonomic diversity and has a more consistent positive effect on the functional and phylogenetic diversity of drylands. In general, effects of facilitation on biodiversity peak in moderate environmental conditions, which suggests that nurse plants can protect biodiversity from impacts of climate change mostly in those places currently under low environmental stress and that will be likely to experience moderate stress levels in the future.

Core-periphery dynamics in a plant-pollinator network	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												Mutualistic networks are highly dynamic, characterized by high temporal turnover of species and interactions. Yet, we have a limited understanding of how the internal structure of these networks and the roles species play in them vary through time. We used 6 years of observation data and a novel statistical method (dynamic stochastic block models) to assess how network structure and species' structural position within the network change throughout subseasons of the flowering season and across years in a quantitative plant-pollinator network from a dryland ecosystem in Argentina. Our analyses revealed a core-periphery structure persistent through subseasons and years. Yet, species structural position as core or peripheral was highly dynamic: virtually all species that were at the core in some subseasons were also peripheral in other subseasons, while many other species always remained peripheral. Our results illuminate our understanding of the dynamics of mutualistic networks and have important implications for ecosystem management and conservation.

As overfertilization is economically and environmentally undesirable, and crop yield and the resulting returns for N input are uncertain when rainfall variability is high, optimizing N management according to the precipitation of fallow season is vital for efficient crop water use and high yield in dryland/rainfed farming systems. Thus, this study established a reference range describing wheat cultivation year types based on fallow season precipitation over 37 years. We conducted an 8-year field experiment using seven different N input rates, to focus on soil water content and its vertical distribution in the 0-300 cm soil layers and to assess the relationship between soil water utilization and yield formation. The final objective was to evaluate how the optimal N input affects crop water consumption, with the aim of maximizing yields. Eight experimental years (2009-2017) were classified as dry and normal years (four of each), with optimum N application rates of 150 and 180 kg N ha(-1), respectively. Compared with that used by farmers (210 kg N ha(-1)), optimum N input saved 26.8% and 12.3% of N fertilizer, increased grain yield by 5.0% and 5.2%, and improved crop water productivity (CWP) by 6.1% and 8.5% in dry and normal years, respectively. Optimized N inputs reduced soil water consumption before the jointing stage and increased the soil water available for grain yield production. Soil water depletion occurred from deeper soil layers with crop development, and soil water storage (SWS) at 80-240 and 200-300 cm depth played an important role in increasing spike number and grain filling, respectively. Furthermore, soil water conservation treatment (increasing rainwater storage via deep plowing at start of the summer fallow season) was unable to eliminate the variability in soil water storage at sowing, and as "drought at sowing" effects on yield were more adverse than "drought in growing season" effects in dryland systems, our results indicate that adjusting N fertilizer inputs based on summer rainfall variation could enhance wheat yield and CWP in the rainfed farming system.

However, the majority of these proba-bilistic studies are conducted at national or global scale to assess the yield loss probability under given drought conditions. There is still a lack of research combining droughts and crop yields in a probabilistic way at a local scale. Moreover, it is unclear how drought threshold triggering yield loss at a given conditional probability will vary in dryland cropping regions. Here, we used wheat yield data from 66 shires in New South Wales (NSW) wheat belt and meteorological data from 986 weather stations. A copula-based probabilistic method was developed to explore the yield loss probability to various drought conditions. We investigated the drought threshold under a given yield loss probability using the constructed copula function. We found that SPEI-6 in October was the optimal drought index to represent detrended wheat yield variation as this period covered the main growth stages of winter wheat in the study region. Our results show that as the severity of drought increased, the wheat yield loss probability also increased. Yield loss probability varied among the study shires, mainly due to the various climate conditions of each region. The drought threshold in subregion 1 (the north-west) was highest, followed by subregion 2 (the southwest) and subregion 3 (the eastern), indicating that wheat yield in subregion 1 was more sensitive to drought. The findings could provide important direction and benchmarks for stakeholders in evaluating the agricultural impact of drought, especially in those drought prone areas. We expect that the methodological framework developed here can be extended to other dryland areas to provide helpful information to growers, risk management policy makers and agricultural insurance evaluators.

For example, plant life-history strategy (e.g. energy for growth or defense), ecosystem function incompatibility (e.g. carbon capture but water loss), ecosystem service compromise (e.g. increasing food production and biodiversity conservation), human well-being choice (e.g. material or spiritual well-being), stakeholder conflict (e.g. different interest groups), and management objective (e.g. social, economic, or environmental). Trade-offs exist within and between almost all of the components and processes of the social-ecological systems (SES). There has been a lot of discussion about trade-offs in the literature, but the meaning of this term is sometimes confused when it is used in different contexts, sometimes mixed with other issues such as mismatches. Efforts to connect different trade-offs and analyze their relationships are also inadequate. This paper is to analyze the key trade-offs in the SES and, as an example, illustrate how fully considered trade-offs will contribute to wiser decision making in dryland SES.

In order to expound the effect of treatment with organic manure in root growth, water transpiration and evaporation, biomass allocation and grain yield and WUE (water use efficiency), we took maize (Zheng Dan 958) sown for four years with three replicates at three densities. The results show that the highest rate of maize grain yield increase with organic manure is about 9.99% for a density of 90,000 plants/ha; at the same time, ET (evapotranspiration) and WUE also achieved marked increments, which the highest values of 415.47 mm with a density of 75,000 plants/ha and 7.92% with a density of 90,000 plants/ha, respectively. The results also demonstrate the obvious effect of organic manure in enhancing root growth and in the maximization of water transpiration and evaporation, and water use plays a vital and valuable role in biomass allocation. The results also serve as orientation for methods to increase maize yield and a reference for other crops in the relation of water and manure to their growth.

As the junction of the atmosphere and the biosphere, soil may play an important role in separating climatic drought stress from vegetation water constraint. Here, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of water constraint on vegetation growth in global drylands by separating precipitation constraint and soil moisture constraint. Although global drylands are characterized by low precipitation supply capacity, there are indeed a large number of grids showing decoupled water availability for plants from variability of precipitation, with ratios of 47%, 64%, and 61% for arid, semiarid, and subhumid regions, respectively. Soil properties, instead of climate and root length regimes, can explain the water constraint divergence between precipitation and soil moisture. Sand content emerges as the most significant soil property to weaken the precipitation constraint on vegetation growth, with a 1% increase in sand content of global arid, semiarid, and dry subhumid regions increasing an average of 0.31, 0.45, and 0.04 gC m(-2) yr(-1) gross primary productivity (GPP) deviation from the theoretical GPP determined by precipitation, respectively. This study provides new insight into how soil texture interacts with precipitation constraints to influence plant-available water in global drylands, which contributes to assessing ecological drought in global drylands.																			1748-9326					NOV 1	2022	17	11							114008	10.1088/1748-9326/ac953f	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac953f													WOS:000869980500001

The experiment was laid out in a split plot design with three replications during the 2018/19 and 2019/20 cropping seasons. Treatments consisted of conventional tillage (CT) and minimum tillage (MT) and three levels of avocado leaf mulch (0, 6 and 12 t/ha). Bulk density (BD), aggregate stability (AS), infiltration rate (IR), soil water content (SWC) and grain yield were determined. Tillage had no significant effect on BD in either season but influenced SWC and sunflower grain yield. CT recorded a significantly higher AS than MT during 2018/19 cropping season. Tillage x mulch interaction was significant during 2018/19 season with CT at 12 t/ha mulch recording higher AS than the MT. IR was significantly influenced by tillage x mulch interaction in both seasons with MT recording higher IR than the CT during 2018/19. Avocado mulch had no significant effect on sunflower grain yield in either season but influenced SWC in 2019/20 season. It was concluded that avocado mulch could be a relevant component of conservation agriculture but long-term studies are needed to validate the benefits observed in this study.

The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance and agronomic characteristics of new wheat cultivars in on-farm conditions using different tillage systems to provide suggestions to help the improvement programs and increase the farmers' crop productivity from cropping systems and new cultivars. Seven wheat cultivars, including three bread wheat and four durum wheat cultivars, were evaluated under three tillage systems, including conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT), and notillage (NT) in farmers' fields conditions across two locations and three cropping seasons (2018-21). The results indicated that some of the traits were mainly explained by the genotype effect (thousand kernel weight, heading date and NDVI), while some others by the management practices (grain yield), some by the location (grain yield, spike density, heading date) and year (grain yield, TKW, NDVI, spike density, heading date) effects. Across years and locations, the highest productivity was recorded under CT (2603 kg/ha) followed by RT (2378 kg/ha) and NT (2295 kg/ha), indicating about 13% and 10% superiority production under CT compared with NT and RT, respectively. The wheat cultivars showed different responses to tillage systems, showing the performance of genotypes varied between tillage systems. The Shalan and Eminbey varieties did not interact with tillage systems, but other genotypes significantly differed in their adaptation to tillage systems. The highest mean yield was recorded for the Saji cultivar (durum wheat) under RT (2310 kg/ha), while the Shalan cultivar (bread wheat) performed well in NT (2058 kg/ha), and Saji, Imren, Zahab (durum wheat), and Rijaw and Paraw (bread wheat) had the highest yield under CT. According to GGE biplot analysis, the Shalan and Eminbey varieties had superior performance across on-farm trials, suggesting that they have a broad adaptation to diverse environments. The results identified genotypes with both specific and general adaptions to tillage systems in farmers' fields, that could be explored for increasing productivity and stability under rainfed conditions. Conservation agriculture principles must be incorporated into current wheat breeding program under CT system, to use wheat genetic diversity for conservation agriculture conditions to keep pace food insecurity.

Avifaunal use of an artificial waterpoint in the Strzelecki Desert during an extended dry period	EMU-AUSTRAL ORNITHOLOGY												Dryland ecosystems have limited and patchily distributed water - a vital resource for species in these landscapes. Degradation of these ecosystems is increasing due to climate change and understanding species' responses to this drying is critical for effective ecosystem management. During an extended dry period, we surveyed drinking visits of an avian community at an artificial waterpoint in semi-arid Australia. Opportunistically, a small rainfall event punctuated the survey, enabling comparisons of avian visitations, before and after the event, as a proxy for increased water availability in the landscape. Visitations of drinking birds to the waterpoint before the rainfall event (17 species) were significantly higher than after (3 species). Permanent waterpoints, such as the single site surveyed in this study, can sustain avifauna during extended dry periods in drylands, affecting spatio-temporal and potentially functional avian community dynamics. Periodic reliance of dryland birds on permanent water may increase with prolonged droughts under climate change, and this reliance must be considered alongside the negative ecological consequences of permanent waterpoints in the management of these ecosystems.

However, eolian sands of diverse grain sizes usually have different provenances, making their quantitative tracing challenging. In this study, a total of 45 samples, including 24 current desert eolian sand samples and 21 provenance region samples, were collected across the Ulan Buh Desert in northwestern China; they were analyzed for trace elements and rare earth elements using inductively coupled plasma mass spec-trometry. The provenance of various grain size fractions was quantitatively traced using a composite finger-printing approach. Our results revealed that provenance contributions to the eolian sand grain size fractions were affected by transport dynamics, transport distance, and source lithology. The Langshan Mountains, which have a highly unstable mineral content, contributed 68% of the very fine sand (<125 mu m). The Hawula Mountains and paleolacustrine deposits in the desert hinterlands, which have the shortest transport distance and are affected by strong winds, contributed 36-65% and 20-56% of the coarser (>125 mu m) fractions of eolian sand in the desert, respectively. Thus, the quantitative contribution of the provenances to eolian sands were as follows: the Hawula Mountains, 39%; paleolacustrine deposits in desert hinterlands, 34%; the Langshan Mountains, 21%; and the peripheral Gobi, 6%. This study suggests that coarse-grained materials can originate from paleolacustrine de-posits in desert hinterlands, which should not be ignored as a substantial provenance of eolian sands in future studies. Moreover, sedimentary sorting should be considered during composite fingerprinting to quantitatively trace the provenance of eolian sands with various grain sizes. This study enables an accurate estimation of the provenance of eolian sands in deserts.

Mutualistic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are functionally important plant root symbionts, and may be particularly important in drought stressed systems such as deserts. Here we provide a first molecular characterization of the AM fungi occurring in several desert ecosystems worldwide. We sequenced AM fungal DNA from soil samples collected from deserts in six different regions of the globe using the primer pair WANDA-AML2 with Illumina MiSeq. We recorded altogether 50 AM fungal phylotypes. Glomeraceae was the most common family, while Claroideoglomeraceae, Diversisporaceae and Acaulosporaceae were represented with lower frequency and abundance. The most diverse site, with 35 virtual taxa (VT), was in the Israeli Negev desert. Sites representing harsh conditions yielded relatively few reads and low richness estimates, for example, a Saudi Arabian desert site where only three Diversispora VT were recorded. The AM fungal taxa recorded in the desert soils are mostly geographically and ecologically widespread. However, in four sites out of six, communities comprised more desert-affiliated taxa (according to the MaarjAM database) than expected at random. AM fungal VT present in samples were phylogenetically clustered compared with the global taxon pool, suggesting that nonrandom assembly processes, notably habitat filtering, may have shaped desert fungal assemblages.

Woody plant encroachment restructures bird communities in semiarid grasslands	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The abundance and distribution of woody plants have increased in grassland ecosystems worldwide. Robust generalizations about the consequences of this transformative process on animal communities have been elusive, especially in semiarid regions where populations of many species have declined. We evaluated how distributions and species richness of breeding birds responded to woody plant encroachment by using spatial variation in woody cover as a proxy for the temporal process by which grasslands transform into shrub savannas. Specifically, we surveyed breeding birds and vegetation on 140 10-ha plots in semiarid grasslands that spanned the gradient of cover by Prosopis (mesquite), a genus of shrubs that has proliferated in semiarid grasslands worldwide. We used a multispecies occupancy model to characterize distributions of breeding bird species along the encroachment gradient. Distributions of 29 of 35 species changed markedly in response to encroachment, with distributions of most obligate grassland species contracting and most facultative grassland species expanding. Species richness increased sharply as cover of woody plants increased and peaked at similar to 22% cover; this increase was driven by recruitment of generalist and shrub-associated species, many of which are common at regional scales. Lastly, we identified thresholds of woody cover where distributions contracted or expanded markedly, which provide targets for conservation and restoration efforts. Our results highlight the importance of understanding species-specific responses to woody plant encroachment as the basis for explaining community-level patterns because increases in diversity at local scales might ultimately reduce diversity at broader scales as grassland specialists are displaced.																			0006-3207	1873-2917				DEC	2019	240								108276	10.1016/j.biocon.2019.108276	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2019.108276													WOS:000501400000002

Ecohydrological threats to <i>Colophospermum mopane</i> in southern Zimbabwe	JAMBA-JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK STUDIES												Rapid ecohydrological changes in semi-arid landscapes are increasingly threatening humanity's life-support systems and eroding many of the ecosystem services (ESs) upon which humans occupying such regions depend. Knowing which services and ecohydrological changes to be most concerned about is indispensable to maintaining the general health of such ecosystems and for developing effective ecosystem management practices. In the semi-arid regions of southwestern Zimbabwe where a large population of rural households depend on ESs extracted from the Colophospermum mopane tree, such understanding may be critical in reversing potential ES losses that may have catastrophic effects on the lives of many. We surveyed a total of 127 rural households who occupy the semi-arid landscapes of the Colophospermum mopane belt in southern Zimbabwe. We assessed the ecohydrological conditions characterising ecosystems where they obtain ES provisioning goods using a number of ecohydrological variables commonly cited in the literature on ecohydrology. Building on principal component analysis (PCA), we employed a hierarchical agglomerative clustering method to create unique clusters of households that depicted different levels of risks or threats associated with their ES provisioning harvesting practices. Multiple regression analysis was further performed to identify significant ecohydrological cluster-defining variables. Our results showed that spatial differences in ecohydrological parameters resulted in four distinct ES resource thresholds depicting four categories of risks that households face in extracting such resources in nearby landscapes. We concluded by proposing a number of landscape restoration or management practices targeted at reversing potential ES losses and subsequently safeguarding the livelihoods of many who depend on ESs.

Composition under land-use change scenarios, especially in drylands, is rarely studied. Here, the soil fungal community composition and diversity of natural shrubland was analyzed and compared with agricultural systems irrigated with different water quality, namely rain, fresh water, dam-stored, and untreated wastewater. Superficial soil samples were collected during the dry and rainy seasons. Amplicon-based sequencing of the ITS2 region was performed on total DNA extractions and used the amplicon sequence variants to predict specific fungal trophic modes with FUNGuild. Additionally, we screened for potential pathogens of crops and humans and assessed potential risks. Fungal diversity and richness were highest in shrubland and least in the wastewater-irrigated soil. Soil moisture together with soil pH and exchangeable sodium were the strongest drivers of the fungal community. The abundance of saprophytic fungi remained constant among the land use systems, while symbiotic and pathogenic fungi of plants and animals had the lowest abundance in soil irrigated with untreated wastewater. We found lineage-specific adaptations to each land use system: fungal families associated to shrubland, rainfed and part of the freshwater were adapted to drought, hence sensitive to exchangeable sodium content and most of them to N and P content. Taxa associated to freshwater, dam wastewater and untreated wastewater irrigated systems show the opposite trend. Additionally, we identified potentially harmful human pathogens that might be a health risk for the population.

Land-use intensification and dairy effluent effects on soil water repellency and soil carbon of a silt loam topsoil	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												In Canterbury, New Zealand, there has been widespread conversion of dryland sheep grazing to more intensive irrigated dairying. We determined the effects of these land uses on soil carbon on a centre-pivot sprinkler-irrigated dairy farm site, a dryland sheep site, and a non-grazed control site. The dairy site had significantly greater carbon density and carbon storage at 10-20 cm and 0-30 cm depths than the sheep farm site. The dairy farm site had significantly greater carbon stock (equivalent soil mass method) than the sheep farm site at 10-20 cm depth. The dairy farm site intensification did not adversely affect soil carbon, including carbon stock by the equivalent soil mass method. The effects of dairy effluent application on soil water repellency and water movement were investigated. The dairy site had significantly greater subcritical repellency index than the sheep site and a dairy effluent site. Further research is required across more farms and soils to confirm these results in these land uses and under other management and climate conditions.

Drought self-propagation in drylands due to land-atmosphere feedbacks	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												Dryland droughts are prone to self-propagation due to the enhanced soil water stress, according to atmospheric moisture-tracking analysis of recent major droughts around the world. Reduced evaporation due to dry soils can affect the land surface energy balance, with implications for local and downwind precipitation. When evaporation is constrained by soil moisture, the atmospheric supply of water is depleted, and this deficit may propagate in time and space. This mechanism could theoretically result in the self-propagation of droughts, but the extent to which this process occurs is unknown. Here we isolate the influence of soil moisture drought on downwind precipitation using Lagrangian moisture tracking constrained by observations from the 40 largest recent droughts worldwide. We show that dryland droughts are particularly prone to self-propagating because evaporation tends to respond strongly to enhanced soil water stress. In drylands, precipitation can decline by more than 15% due to upwind drought during a single event and up to 30% during individual months. In light of projected widespread reductions in water availability, this feedback may further exacerbate future droughts.

These keystone communities face important threats (e.g. climate change) that place their conservation at risk and in turn the sustainability of the ecosystems they inhabit. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop ecosystem management strategies to ensure their protection. However, to provide a solid path towards biocrust conservation, the understanding by stakeholders and governance structures of the ecological functions of these communities, their role as benefit providers, and the pressures threatening their important effects are indispensable. Whereas the ecological scope of biocrust has been widely studied in the last decades, the social dimension of their role remained unexplored. By reviewing literature in biocrusts from a social-ecological approach, here we identified knowledge gaps and new research areas that need to be addressed in order to produce scientific knowledge that better guides dryland conservation policies and actions. This research agenda is a prerequisite to advance biocrust conservation.

Remotely sensed albedo allows the identification of two ecosystem states along aridity gradients in Africa	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Empirical verification of multiple states in drylands is scarce, impeding the design of indicators to anticipate the onset of desertification. Remote sensing-derived indicators of ecosystem states are gaining new ground due to the possibilities they bring to be applied inexpensively over large areas. Remotely sensed albedo has been often used to monitor drylands due to its close relationship with ecosystem status and climate. Here, we used a space-for-time-substitution approach to evaluate whether albedo (averaged from 2000 to 2016) can identify multiple ecosystem states in African drylands spanning from the Saharan desert to tropical Africa. By using latent class analysis, we found that albedo showed two states (low and high; the cut-off level was 0.22 at the shortwave band). Potential analysis revealed that albedo exhibited an abrupt and discontinuous increase with increased aridity (1 - [precipitation/potential evapotranspiration]). The two albedo states co-occurred along aridity values ranging from 0.72 to 0.78, during which vegetation cover exhibited a rapid, continuous decrease from similar to 90% to similar to 50%. At aridity values of 0.75, the low albedo state started to exhibit less attraction than the high albedo state. Low albedo areas beyond this aridity value were considered as vulnerable regions where abrupt shifts in albedo may occur if aridity increases, as forecasted by current climate change models. Our findings indicate that remotely sensed albedo can identify two ecosystem states in African drylands. They support the suitability of albedo indices to inform us about discontinuous responses to aridity experienced by drylands, which can be linked to the onset of land degradation.					wang, xinyuan/HHM-2418-2022; Maestre, Fernando T./A-6825-2008; Berdugo, Miguel/AEX-9525-2022; Vázquez-Jiménez, René/AAB-1454-2019; Wang, Xin/HZL-4695-2023; Novillo, Carlos José/C-6718-2013; Arrogante-Funes, Patricia/N-1332-2018	Maestre, Fernando T./0000-0002-7434-4856; Berdugo, Miguel/0000-0003-1053-8907; Vázquez-Jiménez, René/0000-0003-1693-8303; Novillo, Carlos José/0000-0002-3501-7051; Arrogante-Funes, Patricia/0000-0003-1944-777X													1085-3278	1099-145X				JUL 30	2019	30	12					1502	1515		10.1002/ldr.3338	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.3338													WOS:000475471300009

To examine the potential use of drone (unmanned aerial vehicle; UAV) observation using thermal infrared images for sex ratio monitoring of deer, we conducted UAV surveys at night in a sparse forest located on the distribution periphery of sika deer Cervus nippon and wild boar Sus scrofa local populations during summer and winter. Of the 163 thermal infrared images of large mammals detected, 132 (81.0%) and 16 (9.8%) were identified for deer and wild boar, respectively. In addition, velvet antlers of deer were visually recognized during summer, and 92% of the detected deer were antlered. This biased sex ratio would be a characteristic in the distribution periphery of local deer populations. Therefore, monitoring abundance and sex ratio using thermal infrared sensors on UAVs can improve deer management especially in the distribution periphery of local populations.

Previous studies were little focused on the responses of dryland wheat productivity to the structural changes in ridge-furrow plastic mulching (RFM) system and its mechanism in semiarid eastern African Plateau (EAP). A two-year field experiment was conducted in Juja, a semiarid area in Kenya from 2015 to 2016. There were seven treatments of ridge furrow width and ratios in randomized block design as follows: (1) 40 cm ridge width and 20 cm furrow width (R4F2, the same below), (2) R3F2, (3) R2F2, (4) R3F4, (5) R2F4, (6) R3F6 and (7) R2F6, and conventional flat planting without mulching as control (CK). The results showed that R4F2, R3F2, R2F2, R3F4 and R2F4 treatments significantly improved soil water storage and temperature across two growing seasons compared with CK (P < 0.05). Among all the treatments, R3F2 and R2F2 obviously achieved the highest plant height, leaf area, aboveground biomass (AgB), grain yield and water use efficiency (WUE) (P < 0.05). Also, R2F2 had the highest economic benefits in all treatments. The optimal ridge-furrow ratio appeared to be 1.32-1.38, 1.28-1.31, 1.39-1.49, 1.37-1.45 and 1.46-1.56 for wheat yield, AgB, WUEY, WUEB and harvest index (HI), respectively. In addition, wheat yield, AgB, WUE and HI tended to decrease linearly with the increased ridge-furrow unit size. In conclusion, ridge-furrow ratio of 1-1.5 (R2F2 to R3F2) in combination with the minimum ridge-furrow unit size proved to be the optimum RFM system for the best dryland wheat productivity in accordance to regional soil and climate characteristics in semiarid EAP and other similar areas of the world.

Seasonal irrigation affects the partitioning of new photosynthate carbon in soil	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Long-term irrigation of temperate pastures has been reported to either increase or decrease soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks when compared with dryland systems. Understanding the short-term effects of irrigation on the fixation and partitioning of carbon (C) to plant and soil components may be important to explaining the observed differences. Continuous (CO2)-C-13 pulse labelling of ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) planted mesocosms was used to quantify the net accumulation and partitioning of new photosynthate C to aboveand below-ground components of the plant-soil system, including soil particle size fractions: > 250 mu m, 53-250 mu m, 20-53 mu m, 5-20 mu m and <5 mu m, under simulated irrigation and dryland conditions. After the (CO2)-C-13 labelling, irrigation increased the quantity of C-13 partitioned into herbage by 16%, while reducing the quantity partitioned into roots in the 15-25 cm soil depth by 35%. However, less new photosynthate C was observed in rhizosphere soil (0-15 cm depth), while more new photosynthate C was partitioned into the 53-250 mu m and <5 mu m soil fractions under irrigation. Despite these differences, the net amount of new photosynthate C in the whole soil (0-25 cm depth) was similar between treatments (2511 kg new C ha(-1) dryland and 2509 kg new C ha(-1) irrigated). Therefore, irrigation did not increase the net amount of new photosynthate C in the soil despite increased above-ground pasture productivity. Based on our results, we hypothesise that the recently reported losses of SOC from irrigated pastures may be driven by faster turnover of root-derived C, which may explain the increase in photosynthate C in the fine POM soil size fraction (53-250 mu m), rather than a reduction in photosynthate C inputs to the soil.

The development of water saving cultivation practices is essential instead of relying on irrigation resources. However, the interactive effects of cultivation practices and nitrogen application for maize crop in semi-arid regions have not yet been clear. Therefore, in 2015 and 2016, we studied the interactive effect of three cultivation practices (plastic mulching ridges with furrow planting (RF), furrow planting with soil crust ridges (SC), traditional cultivation (CK)) under three different nitrogen rates 300, 200 and 100 kg ha(-1). The results indicated that the RF system enhanced seeding emergence, prolonged the seed filling duration, and improved biomass and N accumulation than the CK treatment. under the 200 kg N ha(-1) with RF system can increase soil water storage and enhance plant development, reduce ET rate (14.1%), as a result increased grain yield (30.4%), thereby achieving a higher WUE (52.0%), RUE (30.7%) and agronomic efficiency (11.9%) than the CK treatment with 200 kg N ha(-1). As well, RF system significantly improved N uptake efficiency (NupE, 58.5%), N fertilizer productivity (NfP, 33.1%), N use efficiency (NUE, 28.6%) and N harvest index (NHI, 6.1%), in comparison with CK treatment. A high 300 kg N ha(-1) under different cultivation practices considerably reduced NupE, NfP and NUE, and the optimum N rate for the corn must be less than 300 kg ha(-1) to enhance the NupE, NfP and NUE. Therefore, in dryland cultivation areas, the RF system with 200 kg N ha(-1) should be a proper water-saving strategy for achieving higher corn productivity in the dryland cultivation regions.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				FEB 20	2020	228								105879	10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105879	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105879													WOS:000525279000016

The popularization and planting of disease-resistant varieties is the most effective method to prevent and control Verticillium wilt of alfalfa. Therefore, it is particularly important to reveal the resistance mechanism of Verticillium wilt resistant varieties of alfalfa. In this study, the physiological and biochemical indexes were measured on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 after inoculation with Verticillium alfalfae for investigating the response mechanisms of two alfalfa varieties, high-resistant WL343HQ, and low-resistant Dryland. Transcriptome sequencing of alfalfa samples infected with V. alfalfae and uninfected alfalfa samples was performed to analyze the potential functions and signaling pathways of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by GO classification and KEGG enrichment analysis. Meanwhile, weighted gene co-correlation network analysis (WGCNA) algorithm was used to construct a co-expression network of DEGs. Inoculation with V. alfalfae significantly affected net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, chlorophyll content, MDA content, JA and SA concentrations, and NO and H2O2 contents in both WL343HQ and Dryland inoculated with V. alfalfae. Most of the transcription factors in plants were classified in the WRKY, NAC, and bHLH families. WGCNA analysis showed that the number of transcription factors related to plant growth and disease resistance was higher in the corresponding modules of WL343HQ disease groups on days 7 and 28 (WVa) and (WVd) than in the corresponding modules of Dryland disease groups on days 7 and 21 (HVa) and (HVc). These findings provide data for further gene function validation and also provide a reference for in-depth studies on interactions between plants and pathogens.

Interactions of Microhabitat and Time Control Grassland Bacterial and Fungal Composition	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Dryland grasslands are vast and globally important and, as in all terrestrial ecosystems, soil microbial communities play fundamental roles in regulating dryland ecosystem function. A typical characteristic of drylands is the spatial mosaic of vascular plant cover surrounded by interspace soils, where biological soil crusts (biocrusts)-a complex community of organisms including bacteria, fungi, algae, mosses, and lichens-are common. The implications of this heterogeneity, where plants and biocrust cover co-occur, are often explored in the context of soil fertility and hydrology, but rarely has the impact of these multiple microhabitat types been simultaneously explored to determine the influence on bacterial and fungal communities, key biological players in these ecosystems. Further, our understanding of the temporal dynamics of bacterial and fungal communities in grasslands, and of how these dynamics depend on the microhabitat within the ecosystem, is notably poor. Here we used a temporally and spatially explicit approach to assess bacterial and fungal communities in a grassland on the Colorado Plateau, and to link variation in these communities to edaphic characteristics. We found that microhabitat (e.g., vascular plant rhizosphere, biocrust, and below biocrust) was the strongest driver of differences in bacterial and fungal community richness, diversity, and composition. Microhabitat type also significantly mediated the impact of temporal change in shaping community composition. Taken together, 29% of the variation in bacterial community composition could be explained by microhabitat, date, and microhabitat-by-date interactions, while only 11% of the variation in fungal community composition could be explained by the same factors, suggesting important differences in community assembly processes. Soil microbial communities dictate myriad critical ecosystem functions, thus understanding the factors that control their compostition is crucial to considering and forecasting how terrestrial ecosystems work. Overall, this case study provides insights for future studies on the spatial and temporal dynamics of bacterial and fungal communities in dryland grasslands.

AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												High yielding crops such as maize (Zea mays L.) and fodder beet (FB; Beta vulgaris L), are commonly used to extend lactation and increase animal productivity from pastoral dairy systems. Financial modelling to compare costs and benefits of different crops is useful for decision making, but such modelling often fails to account for potential animal health risks which can be associated with feeding supplements. A multi-component, whole-farm modelling approach was used to predict milk solids (MS, milk fat + protein) production and the economic farm surplus (EFS: operating surplus - adjustments) between 2016 and 2018 for an irrigated farm in Canterbury (South Island) and a non-irrigated farm in the Waikato (North Island), of New Zealand. The financial risk of the dairy business was measured using the ratio between mean return on assets (ROA) minus an assumed 5% risk free ROA, and the standard deviation of ROA was calculated from 300 combinations of climate, milk, and feed price, land appreciation, and interest rate. Four scenarios of autumn and spring supplementation of pasture were considered at each geographical location; imported maize silage (Base), a crop of maize silage grown on the milking platform (MSC; area used to produce milk), a crop of FB grown on the milking platform (FBC), and a FB crop with an outbreak of acute (1% stock fatality) and subacute ruminal acidosis (5% decline of feed intake) across the entire herd (FBAC). The MSC scenario improved EFS by 5.8% compared with Base in both the irrigated and the dryland system. The predicted response to MSC reflected greater milk production, lower feed expenses, and shorter crop rotation, compared with either Base, FBC, or FBAC. While FBC increased EFS by 4.8% compared with Base under irrigation, EFS was similar to Base under dryland conditions ($2711 and $2759/ha, respectively). The limited advantage of growing FB under dryland conditions reflect reduced herbage supply due to the extended crop duration of FB compared with maize silage. Model predictions suggest that FBAC will increase the financial risk by reducing milk production and EFS by 6.5% (irrigated) and 7.1% (dryland) compared with Base. In the absence of any adverse health risks, farm performance from the FBC scenario was comparable to that of MSC under irrigated conditions. However, in dryland conditions, and when the potential economic cost of acute and sub-acute ruminal acidosis is considered, there is little advantage to growing FB on the milking platform.

Ground arthropods mediate key soil functions and ecological processes, yet little is known about the influence of dryland vegetation pattern on their abundance and diversity. Here, we investigate how patch size and cover, and distance between patches relate to the abundance and diversity of meso-and microarthropods in semi-arid steppes. We found that species richness and abundance of ground arthropods exponentially increase with vegetation cover, patch size, and patch closeness. The communities under vegetation patches mainly respond to patch size, while the communities in the bare-soil interpatches are mostly controlled by the average distance between patches, independently of the concurrent changes in vegetation cover. Large patches seem to play a critical role as reserve and source of ground arthropod diversity. Our results suggest that decreasing vegetation cover and/or changes in vegetation pattern towards small and over-dispersed vegetation patches can fast lead to a significant loss of ground arthropods diversity in drylands.

However, improvement in soil quality in these areas through plant restoration has been greatly successful. Under this practice, soil microorganisms, especially keystone taxa, exert positive feedback on soil bio-functionality by recycling nutrients. Nevertheless, to date, it remains unclear as to how similar are the changes in these keystone taxa in dryland barren soils and agricultural soils, with comparison perspective. The earlier longer-term experiments in Loess soils have shown profound positive effects of plant restoration and establishment of more complex soil microbial networks in the presence of higher nutrient accumulation. The current work shows more keystone taxa that tend to exist in rehabilitated conditions when compared to their agricultural soil counterparts. Drylands provide crucial ecosystem and economic services across the globe. In barren drylands, keystone taxa drive microbial structure and functioning in soil environments. In the current study, the Chinese Loess plateau's agricultural (AL) and twenty-year-old rehabilitated lands (RL) provided a unique opportunity to investigate land-use-mediated effects on barren soil keystone bacterial and fungal taxa. Therefore, soils from eighteen sites were collected for metagenomic sequencing of bacteria specific 16S rRNA and fungi specific ITS2 regions, respectively, and to conduct molecular ecological networks and construct microbial OTU-based correlation matrices. In RL soils we found a more complex bacterial network represented by a higher number of nodes and links, with a link percentage of 77%, and a lower number of nodes and links for OTU-based fungal networks compared to the AL soils. A higher number of keystone taxa was observed in the RL (66) than in the AL (49) soils, and microbial network connectivity was positively influenced by soil total nitrogen and microbial biomass carbon contents. Our results indicate that plant restoration and the reduced human interventions in RL soils could guide the development of a better-connected microbial network and ensure sufficient nutrient circulation in barren soils on the Loess plateau.

Grain Yield and Maintains Soil Water Balance in Semiarid Environment	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Ridge-furrow cultivation with plastic film mulching has been widely used for many years to increase crop yields in semiarid regions. The long-term effects of plastic mulching on crop yield and soil water balance need to be seriously considered to assess the sustainability of this widely used field management technique. A seven-year maize field experiment was conducted during 2012-2018 to estimate the yield sustainability and soil water balance with two treatments-mulching (yes; no) and nitrogen fertilization (yes; no). This resulted in the following four groups-no film mulching, no N application (M0N0); film mulching, no N application (M1N0); no film mulching, N application (M0N1); film mulching and N application (M1N1). Our results show that plastic mulching significantly increased maize yield. A combination of mulching and nitrogen application had the highest sustainability yield index (SYI) of 0.75, which was higher than the other three treatments, with SYI values of 0.31, 0.33, and 0.39, respectively. Plastic film mulching increased soil water content and water storage in both the sowing and harvesting periods and did not cause the formation of dry soil layers. Precipitation storage efficiency (PSE) in the nongrowing season played a key role in maintaining the soil water balance and it was positively affected by plastic film mulching. Our research indicates that plastic mulching and N application could maintain maize yield sustainability and the soil water balance of agriculture in semiarid regions. In addition, we highlight the importance of nongrowing season precipitation, and thus, we suggest that mulching the field land with plastic film throughout the whole year should be adopted by farmers to store more precipitation, which is important to crop growth.					zhang, feng/L-2587-2013	Zhang, Feng/0000-0001-5893-0604														2073-4395				APR	2020	10	4							600	10.3390/agronomy10040600	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10040600													WOS:000534620300087

Smut is one of the main diseases of Sorghum in the area. The experiment was conducted at Sekota Dryland Agricultural Research Center for two consecutive cropping seasons. The aim was to determine the effectiveness of some botanicals in controlling covered smut on sorghum. These botanicals were compared with Thiram chemical and an untreated check. Smut inoculated sorghum seed was treated with dried and grounded powder materials of each botanical at a rate of 6 gram per 100 grams of seed by mixing thoroughly with little water and put for 24 hours and then air-dried before planting. Sisal aqueous solution was extracted from sisal fresh leaves at a rate of 10 ml for 100 grams of seed. The individual and combined results showed that Sisal and Thiram significantly (P <= 0.05) controlled the disease more than others. Infection percentage and number of infected plants by covered smut were significantly (P <= 0.05) reduced and the higher yield was gained on both treatments. The partial budget analysis also revealed that Sisal had 8,184Ethiopian birr over negative control and 1149Ethiopian birr over positive control as an economic advantage besides its accessibility and environmental soundness. The overall result and partial budget analysis indicated that the use of Sisal leaf extract, as a seed treatment against sorghum covered smut is potentially useful for smallholder farmers of Wag-Lasta and similar sorghum producing Agro-ecological areas.

EFFECTS OF FERTILIZATION ON SOIL WATER USE EFFICIENCY AND CROP YIELD ON THE LOESS PLATEAU, CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The selection of appropriate fertilizers influences agricultural production, especially in water limited conditions such as those on the Loess Plateau (China). In this study, we aimed to determine the optimum method for the fertilization of dryland crops. In a two-year split-plot experiment, we tested eight fertilization treatments with different combinations of organic and inorganic fertilizers and a no-fertilizer control. Crop yield, soil water storage, and soil water use efficiency (WUE) were assessed pre-sowing and post-harvest in 2017 and 2018. The results showed that soil water storage was decreased by fertilization, while the WUE and crop yield were both increased: compared to the control, WUE was 6-39% higher in 2017 and 8-39% higher in 2018, while crop yield was 3-21% higher in 2017 and 1-19% higher in 2018. The maximum effect on WUE and crop yield was achieved when a combination of organic fertilizer and either nitrogen or phosphate fertilizer was applied. Linear regression analysis revealed that soil water consumption (ET) was significantly positively correlated with crop yield. Our results provide a scientific basis for rational crop fertilization on the Loess Plateau and suggest that a combination of organic and inorganic fertilizers is the most appropriate.						liu, qiang/0000-0003-3814-7561; Zhao, Guangju/0000-0002-4233-9403; Zhao, Guangju/0000-0001-7756-4494													1589-1623	1785-0037					2020	18	5					6555	6568		10.15666/aeer/1805_65556568	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1805_65556568													WOS:000585225100033

This study aims to investigate the possible existence of meaningful mega-environments and identify high-yielding and stable genotypes for rainfed durum wheat-growing regions. The GGE (genotypic main effect plus genotype-by-environment interaction) and GGL (genotypic main effect plus genotype-by-location interaction) biplots analyses were applied to durum wheat grain yield data from multi-year trials conducted at six locations differing in climatic conditions across Iran. Yearly multi-location analysis of variance for grain yield revealed that the location was the main source of variation and captured for 78.5-89.8% of total variation and the GL interaction, depending on year, was greater 2.8-4.4 times than genotype effect alone. The collective analysis of yearly GGL biplots revealed repeatable locations grouping across years and showed that the durum wheat growing region can be divided into four MEs: the western ME represented by the moderate cold location, southern-west ME represented by moderate warm location, western-north ME and eastern-north ME both represented for cold locations. The results suggest that durum wheat yield trials should be conducted and genotype recommendation be made according to each ME. The evaluation of genotypes for mean yield and stability performance per each ME, recommended the breeding line G14 for each both western and western-north MEs, breeding line G10 for southern-west ME and breeding line G3 for eastern-north ME. Based on the factorial regression analysis, climatic variables of monthly rainfall in March (17.5%), May (9.5%), June (7.9%), April (6.8%), cumulative rainfall (12.5%), and average temperature of January (6.6%) significantly (P < 0.01) affected genotypes performance and contributed to 60.8% of total GE variation. The results confirmed four different mega-environments in durum wheat yield trials, suggest genotype recommendation should be made according to each mega-environment.

Long-term biosolids land application influences soil health	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Soil health assessments associated with organic amendment applications have primarily focused attention on manure or composts. Yet, quantifying specific changes in soil health associated with biosolids land applications has yet to be determined. Our objectives were to evaluate the changes in various soil indicators, and utilizing the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF), quantify changes in soil indicator scores and soil health indices as affected by either increasing inorganic N fertilizer (0 up to 112 kg N ha(-1)) or biosolids (0 up to 11.2 dry Mg ha(-1)) applied every other year over 22 years. Soils were sampled (0 to 20 cm depth) following 22 years of N fertilizer or biosolids inputs to a dryland wheat-fallow (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation, 11 soil health indicators were monitored under SMAF guidelines, and indicators, indicator scores, and soil health indices were analyzed statistically. In general, increasing N fertilizer application rates had little effect on soil indicators, SMAF indicator scores or soil health indices. Increasing biosolids application rates increased soil organic C (SOC) and potentially mineralizable N (PMN). The SMAF indicator scores showed upward trends for soil pH, SOC, PMN, and microbial biomass C (MBC) associated with increasing biosolids application rates; discussing trends are important as these indicator scores are combined to provide soil health indices. Indeed, increasing biosolids application rates increased soil chemical and biological health indices, leading to an improvement in the overall soil health index. When comparing the overall N fertilizer to biosolids effect, biosolids applications significantly improved the soil biological health index. Results indicate that long-term biosolids land application to semi-arid, dryland wheat fallow rotations, similar to those studied, improve various aspects of soil health. These findings suggest that biosolids may play a pivotal role in dryland agroecosystem sustainability. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thirty one genotypes of bread wheat were examined under normal irrigated and rain-fed conditions for their protein, Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, P, Na and K grain concentrations. The experiment was conducted as a split-plot (irrigated and rain-fed as main plots and 31 cultivars as sub-plots) in a randomized complete block design with three replications in Sanandaj, Kurdistan, Iran, during the 2013-2014 cropping season. Based on a two-way Anova, we found large inter-genotype variations among the traits. Significant differences were also observed for the genotypes between normal irrigated and rain-fed conditions. Except for the grain protein concentration, which showed only a 1.93 % increase, the rain-fed conditions negatively affected each of the other traits significantly. Major effects were found for grain yield, number of grains per spike and grain Zn concentration, showing 43.09 %, 27.74 % and 23.88 % reductions, respectively. Negative correlations were observed between grain yield and grain protein, Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, P and Na concentrations. Our data show that breeding for higher tonnage-yield during the past 80 years has brought success but at the cost of lower concentrations of protein and microelements in the wheat grains.

Without consideration of soil salt, the quality of radiometer-based SM products might be impaired. This study explores the magnitude, frequency dependence, seasonal patterns, and influence factors of soil salinity effects based on triple collocation (TC) analyses using X-, C-, and L-band radiometer-based SM products over global cropland. Multiple products corroborate that soil salinity dynamics contributes an uncertainty of 0.005-0.01 cm(3) . cm(-3) to the total SM retrieval error budget, proportional to soil salt concentration, higher at L-band and lower at X-/C-band. Soil salinity effects are stronger in spring and summer when rainfall drives significant soil salinity dynamics. SM retrieval uncertainty increases monotonously with the duration time of nonprecipitating weathers when salt is uplifted onto topsoil and sensed by microwave radiometers. Despite of overall weaker saline effects, X-/C-band products seem to respond earlier than the L-band SM products as soils become salinized, probably due to complicated soil-salt-water dielectric properties and shallower microwave penetration depths. The neglect of loss factor in soil moisture active passive (SMAP) SM retrieval algorithm might also enhance soil salinity effects. These uncertainties are essentially time-varying wet biases, and dynamic soil salinity maps are needed for bias-correcting current L-band and future P-band SM products.

However, there is limited research on the geochemical comparison of aeolian sediments formed under distinctive tectonic and climatic settings. Surficial sand samples from the Taklamakan Desert and Horqin Sandy Land in northern China were collected, and the major, trace, and rare earth elements (REEs) in the bulk samples, fine fractions (<75 mu m) and coarse fractions (>75 mu m) of sand were analyzed. This study aimed to explore the spatial variation in the geochemical composition of aeolian sand and its drivers. The results show that differences between the two regions are primarily caused by the intensity of chemical weathering, sedimentary recycling, and provenance. The mean chemical proxy of alteration (72.3 vs. 77.8) and the Parker's weathering values (37.8 vs. 55.8) both suggest the bulk samples from the Horqin Sandy Land experienced more intense chemical weathering, whereas physical weathering is a dominant process in the Taklamakan Desert. These differences may be attributed to the different climatic conditions in the two regions and the exposure time to weathering. A combination of the index of compositional variability and immobile trace element ratios shows that aeolian sand in the Horqin Sandy Land underwent more intense sedimentary recycling than sediments in the Taklamakan Desert. REEs ratios (such as Cr/V and Y/Ni) and the Al2O3-CaO*+Na2O-K2O (A-CN-K) diagram indicate aeolian sand in the Taklamakan Desert is probably derived from mixed source rocks of tonalite, granite, and granodiorite. Eu anomaly vs. (La/ Yb) N diagrams suggest that the primary source-rocks contributing to the coarse and fine fractions in the Horqin Sandy Land are different but mainly derived from the Great Hinggan Mountains. Differences in the provenance of the fine- and coarse-grained fractions are primarily controlled by interactions between wind and fluvial systems.

Large phenotypic and genotypic variations (PCV, GCV) for agronomic (3148.3, 1829.3) followed by morphological (253.3, 232.5), physiological (18.2, 17.6) and phenological (14.2, 12.6) traits were observed. The high heritability (h2) coupled with high percent of genetic advance as percent of mean (GAM%) was expressed highest in physiological traits (i.e., chlorophyll fluorescence (h2 = 0.70, GMA% = 250.1) and normalized difference vegetation index (h2 = 0.71, GMA% = 193.8)), followed by morphological traits (i.e., peduncle extrusion (0.90, 186.9), peduncle length (0.95, 109.2), flag-leaf length (0.85, 108.4)), agronomic traits (i.e, harvest index (0.59, 230.1), 1000-kernel weight (0.83, 42.7)) and phenological traits (i.e., days to 50% booting (0.91, 7.6) and heading (0.93, 6.9)). Based on the results, superior genotypes (URRACA, Saji and Icasyr1/3/Gcn//Stj/Mrb3) with high yielding performance, good trait profiles and high drought tolerance were identified. The findings of this research demonstrated the existence of high response to selection for agrophysiological traits in durum wheat under drought conditions, which represents potential in hybridization schemes of wisely chosen parents for creating genetically improved drought tolerant varieties.

Plant Population and Row Spacing Affects Growth and Yield of Rainfed Maize in Semi-arid Environments	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Increased tolerance to competition for soil resources of modern maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids increases soil resource use efficiency and yield. Yet little information is available on the relationship between maize population density and yield under no-tillage in semi-arid environments. A 2-year field trial was conducted in South Africa during the 2017/2018 (Season 1) and 2018/2019 (Season 2) production seasons to evaluate growth and water use productivity of rainfed maize established at seven diverse plant population (20,000-60,000 plants ha(-1)) and row spacing (0.52 and 0.76 m) configurations. In Season 1, light interception was 6.8% greater at 0.76 m row spacing compared to 0.52 m row spacing (p < 0.05). In Season 2, despite dry and hot growing conditions, a well-developed leaf canopy cover was present at 0.52 m row spacing indicating a 10.4% greater intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (IPAR) compared to 0.76 m row spacing. In Season 1, with more uniform rainfall distribution, no biomass or yield benefits were found with increased plant population, except at 50,000 plants ha(-1) at 0.76 m row spacing. In Season 2, plant populations at 0.76 m row spacing out-yielded any given plant population at 0.52 m row spacing. The optimal plant population and row spacing will ultimately be a compromise between obtaining high maize grain yield and minimizing the potential for crop failure in semi-arid environments.

MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Dryland ecosystems are increasing in geographic extent and contribute greatly to interannual variability in global carbon dynamics. Disentangling interactions among dominant primary producers, including plants and autotrophic microbes, can help partition their contributions to dryland C dynamics. We measured the delta C-13 signatures of biological soil crust cyanobacteria and dominant plant species (C(3)and C-4) across a regional scale in the southwestern USA to determine if biocrust cyanobacteria were coupled to plant productivity (using plant-derived C mixotrophically), or independent of plant activity (and therefore purely autotrophic). Cyanobacterial assemblages located next to all C(3)plants and one C(4)species had consistently more negative delta C-13 (by 2 parts per thousand) than the cyanobacteria collected from plant interspaces or adjacent to two C(4)Boutelouagrass species. The differences among cyanobacterial assemblages in delta C-13 could not be explained by cyanobacterial community composition, photosynthetic capacity, or any measured leaf or root characteristics (all slopes not different from zero). Thus, microsite differences in abiotic conditions near plants, rather than biotic interactions, remain a likely mechanism underlying the observed delta C-13 patterns to be tested experimentally.

This work aims to elucidate downstream trends in facies and architecture across the medial and distal zones of terminal-fan systems, which record transitions from deposits of channel elements to lobe-like and sheet-like elements. This is achieved via a detailed characterization of ancient ephemeral fluvial deposits of the well-exposed Kimmeridgian Tordillo Formation (Neuquen Basin, Argentina). The fine sand-prone and silt-prone succession associated with the medial to distal sectors of the system has been studied to understand relationships between depositional processes and resulting architectures. Facies and architectural-element analyses, and quantification of resulting sedimentological data at multiple scales, have been undertaken to characterize sedimentary facies, facies transitions, bed types, architectural elements and larger-scale architectural styles. Eight bed types with distinct internal facies transitions are defined and interpreted in terms of different types of flood events. Channelized and non-channelized architectural elements are defined based on their constituent bed types and their external geometry. The most common elements are terminal lobes, which are composite bodies within which largely unconfined sandy deposits are stacked in a compensational manner; a hierarchical arrangement of internal components is recognized. Proximal feeder-channel avulsion events likely controlled the evolution of terminal-lobe elements and their spatiotemporal shifts. Stratigraphic relations between architectural elements record system-wide trends, whereby a proximal sector dominated by channel elements passes downstream via a gradational transition to a medial sector dominated by sandy terminal-lobe elements, which in turn passes further downstream to a distal sector dominated by silty terminal lobe-margin and fringing deposits. This work enhances current understanding of the stratigraphic record of terminal fluvial systems at multiple scales, and provides insight that can be applied to predict the facies and architectural complexity of terminal fluvial successions.

J	Fang, C				Fang, Chao			Decreased temperature sensitivity of soil respiration induced by warming slowed topsoil carbon turnover in a semi-arid grassland	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												The carbon feedback between soil and climate is partly determined by topsoil organic carbon turnover time (tau). However, the tau under future warmer climate still remains unclear. Herein, a manipulative experiment was conducted in a semi-arid grassland on the Loess Plateau of China to investigate the underlying mechanisms of the response of topsoil tau to warming. The results showed that warming significantly increased topsoil tau, which was directly regulated by the decreased temperature sensitivity of soil microbial respiration and indirectly due to the decreased pH and the increased aboveground biomass, soil inorganic nitrogen and soil carbon substrate quality. These results implied that short-term warming could potentially promote soil carbon sequestration in the semiarid grassland.

Herein, we address a knowledge gap over the "hot spot" research on tillage practices on SOC storage and CO2 emission in crop residue-returned farming systems. In this study, a long-term (2007-2019) field experiment was conducted, and the crop residues were returned to the soil after harvest; then, three tillage methods were conducted: no tillage (NT), subsoiling tillage (ST), and a moldboard plow tillage (CT). Our results showed that in the crop residue-returned farming system, NT and ST still showed advantages of lower CO2 flux compared with CT, as well as a reduced average CO2 flux of 14.5% and 8.5%, respectively, over a two-year average. The results of our long-term study suggest that the NT had advantages of SOC accumulation. In addition, as of June 2018, NT increased SOC stocks with 5.85 Mg hm(-2) at a 0-60-cm soil depth compared with CT, whereas no significant difference was found between ST and CT. Overall, adopting NT in a crop residue-returned farming system improved SOC storage to 5.85 Mg hm(-2) after 11 years as well as decreased CO2 flux by 14.5% in comparison with CT, which is meaningful in improving soil carbon pool and decreasing soil CO2 emission during agriculture production.

In this study, the effects of 17 years of GE on a) soil fertility, b) stoichiometric ratios between soil nutrients and c) carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage in particulate and mineral-associated organic matter soil fractions were assessed in an area degraded by overgrazing (OG) in a semi-arid region in Brazil. For this purpose, three sites with two treatments (exclusion and overgrazing) were studied at three sampling depths (0-10, 10-20 and 20-40 cm). Our results showed that pH, total organic carbon, particulate organic carbon, total N, particulate organic nitrogen, Ca2+ and K+ increased, whereas the Al3+ content decreased with GE. Conversely, the available P content, Mg2+ and Na+ showed no significant variations as a function of GE. A relatively constant C:N:P ratio (30:4:1) was observed, with little variation as a function of GE or OG, indicating a high total P content in the soil. Labile fractions (particulate) of C and N increased with GE. According to our results, GE can be used as a strategy to restore degraded natural pastures in arid and semi-arid ecosystems.

Heart rate and oxygen uptake (VO2) were continuously measured before and after the 50-m swim test (off-kinetics).Results: Performance was impaired 1.9% (0.54 s) for males (P = .007, d = 0.91) and 2.9% (0.89 s) for females (P = .033, d = 0.93). Neither the anthropometrical changes (males: r2 = .516, P = .077; females: r2 = .096, P = .930) nor the physical activities that each participant performed during the off-season (males: r2 = .060, P = .900; females: r2 = .250, P = .734) attenuated performance impairments. Stroke rate and clean swimming speed decreased (P < .05), despite similar stroke length and stroke index (P > .05). Blood lactate concentrations remained similar (P > .05), but VO2 peak decreased in females (P = .04, d = 0.85). Both sexes showed higher heart rate before and after the 50-m swim test after 5 weeks (P < .05). Anaerobic metabolic power deterioration was only observed in males (P = .035, d = 0.65). Lower in-water force during tethered swimming at zero speed was observed in males (P = .033, d = 0.69). Regarding dryland strength, lower-body impairments were observed for males, while females showed upper-body impairments (P < .05).Conclusions: A 5-week training cessation yielded higher heart rate in the 50-m front crawl, anaerobic pathways, and dryland strength impairments. Coaches should find alternatives to minimize detraining effects during the off-season.

Seed bank community and soil texture relationships in a cold desert	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Sustainable dryland management depends on understanding environmental factors driving the composition of current and future ecological communities. While there has been extensive research on aboveground plant communities, less is known about belowground soil seed bank communities. In the Colorado Plateau of the western United States, we simultaneously explored aboveground and belowground plant communities and how they varied across sites with similar climate but contrasting soil textures. We found that aboveground vegetation and belowground seed bank community composition each varied significantly among sites. We also observed marked aboveground-belowground compositional dissimilarity across sites, suggesting that the two spatially associated communities may respond differently to the same environmental gradient. Lastly, we found that abundances of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) - one of the region's major exotic invasive plants - varied strongly with soil texture, a finding with implications for invasive species management. From our results, we highlight two general patterns for dryland managers. First, we show that aboveground and belowground plant communities can respond to the same environmental variation in a strongly divergent manner. Second, the data underscore a large potential role for soil texture and its associated factors in mediating plant community responses to a range of environmental conditions.

J	Root, HT; Miller, JED; Rosentreter, R				Root, Heather T.; Miller, Jesse E. D.; Rosentreter, Roger			Grazing disturbance promotes exotic annual grasses by degrading soil biocrust communities	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Exotic invasive plants threaten ecosystem integrity, and their success depends on a combination of abiotic factors, disturbances, and interactions with existing communities. In dryland ecosystems, soil biocrusts (communities of lichens, bryophytes, and microorganisms) can limit favorable microsites needed for invasive species establishment, but the relative importance of biocrusts for landscape-scale invasion patterns remains poorly understood. We examine effects of livestock grazing in habitats at high risk for invasion to test the hypothesis that disturbance indirectly favors exotic annual grasses by reducing biocrust cover. We present some of the first evidence that biocrusts increase site resistance to invasion at a landscape scale and mediate the effects of disturbance. Biocrust species richness, which is reduced by livestock grazing, also appears to promote native perennial grasses. Short mosses, as a functional group, appear to be particularly valuable for preventing invasion by exotic annual grasses. Our study suggests that maintaining biocrust communities with high cover, species richness, and cover of short mosses can increase resistance to invasion. These results highlight the potential of soil surface communities to mediate invasion dynamics and suggest promising avenues for restoration in dryland ecosystems.

However, its feasibility remains under dispute in semiarid regions, especially where there can be extreme droughts. We therefore investigated how intercropping with annual bioenergy crops, soybean (Glycine max) and canola (Brassica rapa), affects ecohydrology in young apple trees, and how the trees respond to droughts of varying degrees on the semiarid Loess Plateau of China. A monoculture orchard was used as a control, and the droughts were controlled by reducing natural precipitation by 15% (moderate drought) and 25% (severe drought). We found that, compared with the monoculture, the agroforestry system increased soil water storage (SWS) in the 80-280 cm by 5-8%, apple tree's daily water use (Q) by 76-118%, and transpiration per unit leaf area (TrL) by 3371%; it also promoted tree growth. Both drought levels affected soil water availability and water use. Compared with agroforestry without an enforced drought, moderate drought conditions reduced SWS in the 80-180 cm by 11-15%, the Q value by 19-24%, and TrL value by 13-17%, and these apple trees still had higher Q and TrL levels than monoculture trees suffering no drought; and severe drought conditions caused the apple trees to absorb soil water from deeper soil layers, and reduced SWS in the 80-280 cm by 16-18%, Q by 50-60% and TrL by 12-38%. However, there were no significant difference in Q, TrL and aboveground growth parameters for trees between monoculture and severe drought treatments. These findings demonstrate that agroforestry has clear ecohydrological advantage to monoculture for young apple trees in semiarid regions.																			0168-1923	1873-2240				JUN 15	2022	321								108969	10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.108969	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.108969		APR 2022											WOS:000795690500005

In a tropical dryland of central Mexico, rainfed agriculture and firewood extraction resulted in abandoned croplands and mesquite shrublands, respectively. Our aim was to evaluate the species richness, density, and composition of the soil seed bank in abandoned croplands and mesquite shrublands. Species richness and seed density were evaluated in soil samples taken from open spaces and under shrubs in abandoned croplands and mesquite shrublands during the dry season. Seeds were identified and grouped into grasses, weeds, and native plants. The species richness and seed density were similar between the soil bank of abandoned croplands and mesquite shrublands. The soil seed bank in abandoned croplands was dominated by weeds and grasses, whereas in mesquite shrublands was dominated by weeds and native plants. The soil seed bank was relatively similar between the rainfed agriculture and firewood extraction. These results suggest that rainfed agriculture and firewood extraction promote similar changes in the soil seed bank of this tropical dryland, despite being very different subsistence activities.																			0140-1963	1095-922X				DEC	2023	219								105091	10.1016/j.jaridenv.2023.105091	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2023.105091		NOV 2023											WOS:001112520600001

We conducted a field experiment to test whether applying extruded seed pellets inoculated with native microbes affected soil properties related to ecosystem function in severely degraded mine soil. We found that inoculating with bacteria did not affect soil carbon, metabolic quotient (a measure of microbial stress), or basal respiration, but increased soil nitrogen by 75%, substrate-induced respiration by 147% and reduced carbon-to-nitrogen ratio by 44% compared to the control. This suggests that the bacteria inoculant contained free-living N fixers that increased the soil N content. Thus, inoculating with bacteria could supplement nitrogen fertilizers in degraded soils during soil restoration. However, we found that inoculating with a mix of bacteria and cyanobacteria did not affect any of the soil properties. This finding is counter to results in laboratory studies, suggesting that field tests are critical for understanding real-world outcomes of microbial inoculation. Finally, we found that soil microbial composition was changed by the inoculation with a mix of bacteria and cyanobacteria.

Our data suggest that microbial inoculation could improve some aspects of ecosystem function and thus provide beneficial effects that might facilitate restoration of degraded sites.

Our empirical strategy relies on panel data models with fixed effects that exploit spatial and temporal variability in drought conditions and agricultural outcomes at the county level. We find negative and statistically significant effects of drought on crop yields equal to reductions in the range of 0.1% to 1.2% for corn and soybean yields for each additional week of drought in dryland counties, and 0.1% to 0.5% in irrigated counties. Region-specific results vary, with some regions experiencing no yield impacts from drought, while yield reductions as high as 8.0% are observed in dryland counties in the Midwest for every additional week of drought in the highest USDM severity category. Despite this impact on crop yields, we find that additional weeks of drought have little to no effect on measures of farm income. While precipitation and temperature explain most of the variability in crop yields, we find that the USDM captures additional negative impacts of drought on yields.

A shifting 'river of sand': The profound response of Australia's Warrego River to Holocene hydroclimatic change	GEOMORPHOLOGY												In dryland river catchments, palaeochannels provide some of the key records for understanding the changes in river character and behaviour that can occur in response to different extrinsic and intrinsic controls. Here, we combine modern hydroclimatic datasets, satellite imagery, field surveys, and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of palaeochannels to investigate the response of the similar to 850 km long Warrego River, located in central eastern Australia, to Holocene hydroclimatic change. The modern Warrego is an intermittent to ephemeral, low energy river (unit stream power, omega, <= 4 W m(-2)), and is characterised by low sinuosity ('straight'), narrow (<50 m), single-thread, anabranching, and distributary channels that transport fine-grained (dominantlymud and sand) sediment. Marked downstream declines in discharge and stream power mean that many channels are discontinuous, terminating downstream at floodouts or in unchannelled floodplain wetlands before reaching the Darling River. By contrast, OSL ages and palaeohydrological reconstructions show that between similar to 8 and 5 ka, higher energy (similar to 8-10 W m(-2)), wider (similar to 160 m), meandering channels were the characteristic river style. In the Burrenbilla and Coongoola palaeochannels, prevailing La Nina conditions were likely responsible for bankfull discharges between 3 and 59 times those of the modern river, which probably enabled the palaeochannels to maintain perennial flow in continuous courses to the Darling River. After similar to 5 ka, El Nino events became stronger and more frequent, leading to greater catchment aridity and lower, more variable, river discharges. These extrinsic changes resulted in intrinsic adjustments to river character and behaviour, with key geomorphic thresholds being crossed in the cessation of meandering and establishment of the modern single-thread, anabranching, and distributary channels. The Warrego River's dramatic pattern transformation in response to mid- to late Holocene hydroclimatic change has similarities with some other Australian dryland river responses over equivalent timeframes. The pattern transformation demonstrates the Warrego River's sensitivity to extrinsic forcing and represents one of the most profound dryland river changes in the late Quaternary.

The site was previously excavated in the 1880s and the 1960s, and in 2016 the South West Heritage Trust excavated a building, that proved to be an outbuilding used when the medieval chapel was in operation. Soil micromorphological analysis was conducted first to understand the sediments within the profile from this building, which appeared fairly homogenous and bioturbated in the field. It untangled the bioturbation processes and revealed a rare northern European, geoarchaeological example of a livestock enclosure from a dryland context in this temperate environment. The results of our innovative multi-proxy approach highlight the potential and methodological considerations for future studies to integrate micromorphology, palaeoparasitology and mycology to examine animal management on dryland archaeological sites. They increase the knowledge of the economic activities of the ecclesiastical occupation at Beckery, contributing to an enhanced understanding of the Chapel site, its wider landscape and its role as part of the Glastonbury Abbey estate.

J	Ayoubi, S; Dehaghani, SM				Ayoubi, Shamsollah; Dehaghani, Saeid Moazzeni			Identifying impacts of land use change on soil redistribution at different slope positions using magnetic susceptibility	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Clear-cutting of Oak forests and intensive cultivation on the hilly regions of the Zagros Mountains has led to plausible threats on the natural ecosystem and catastrophic floods in western Iran. This study was conducted to explore the effects of clear-cutting of natural forests in different slope positions on some soil chemical and physical properties as well as quantification of soil redistribution using magnetic susceptibility. Two adjacent sites, including natural forest and cultivated lands, were selected and a total of six transects at three soil depths (0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm) and a total of seventy-two soil samples were examined. Soil properties such as particle size distributions, bulk density (rho b), calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE), soil organic matter (SOM), and magnetic susceptibility at low and high frequencies were measured. Results indicated that clear-cutting and cultivation for 50 years significantly (p < 0.05) increased rho b and CCE and reduced SOM and TN. Moreover, magnetic susceptibility at four slope positions was significantly (p < 0.05) lower compared with the natural forest. Using a simple proportional model to estimate the soil loss or gain and comparing the mean chi(lf) in any given point confirmed a high rate of soil loss in cultivated sites. In the forest soils, low soil loss in shoulder position and high rate of deposition in footslope and backslope positions were obtained. In general, it is revealed that magnetic measures could provide valuable estimates of mid-term soil erosion and sedimentation in the hilly region following land use changes.																			1866-7511	1866-7538				JUN 3	2020	13	11							426	10.1007/s12517-020-05383-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12517-020-05383-x													WOS:000540054900001

Authors used machine learning algorithms to predict global scale soil salinization under changing climate in the 21st century. Soil salinization has become one of the major environmental and socioeconomic issues globally and this is expected to be exacerbated further with projected climatic change. Determining how climate change influences the dynamics of naturally-occurring soil salinization has scarcely been addressed due to highly complex processes influencing salinization. This paper sets out to address this long-standing challenge by developing data-driven models capable of predicting primary (naturally-occurring) soil salinity and its variations in the world's drylands up to the year 2100 under changing climate. Analysis of the future predictions made here identifies the dryland areas of South America, southern and western Australia, Mexico, southwest United States, and South Africa as the salinization hotspots. Conversely, we project a decrease in the soil salinity of the drylands in the northwest United States, the Horn of Africa, Eastern Europe, Turkmenistan, and west Kazakhstan in response to climate change over the same period.

Amarender			ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT OF WATER HARVESTING PLUS SUPPLEMENTAL IRRIGATION FOR IMPROVING WATER PRODUCTIVITY OF A PULSE-COTTON BASED INTEGRATED FARMING SYSTEM IN TELANGANA, INDIA<SUP>†</SUP>	IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE												An integrated farming system (IFS) aims to sustain agricultural production, maintain farm incomes, safeguard the environment and respond to climate change impacts. Experiments in a tribal farmer's fields during 2016-2018 with two IFS models (pulse and cotton) were conducted in the Telangana region, India. An on-farm reservoir (OFR) is designed for storing surface runoff based on the area and runoff coefficient determined through a modelling approach. The results demonstrated how supplemental irrigation and water harvesting are the most important and proven technologies for improving crop productivity and the efficient use of water in dryland areas of the semi-arid tropics. The economic analysis indicated that after introduction of OFR technology, farmers' profits were increased under both scenarios of prolonged and short dry spells. According to the results, adoption of the OFR and IFS models not only ensured economic returns but provided regular employment even on less than 1 ha of land, which is usually non-sustainable if monocropping is being practised. The approaches used in this work might be useful for guiding producers' decisions in optimizing resources and selecting crops based on economic and water use efficiency.

It harbours an exceptional biodiversity with numerous endangered plants and animals. Indeed, several recent studies have been carried out in TESF to consolidate judgment of its importance for conservation in Ivory Coast. These investigations have mentioned the presence of threatened monkeys and frogs. Currently, small mammals of the TESF remain unknown despite the consensus around their importance in natural biotopes. Yet small terrestrial mammals are known to be good indicators of the conservation status of many tropical ecosystems. This study is a preliminary exploration of terrestrial small mammal communities in the Tanoe-Ehy Swamp Forest. It aims to determine species composition and reveal their implication in the conservation of the Tanoe-Ehy Swamp Forest. Thus, the three main habitat types (dryland forests, swamp forests and raphials (Raphia-dominated community)) were sampled using conventional Sherman and Victor wooden snap traps. With a trapping effort of 8400 trap nights, 294 individuals, representing nine species of rodents and four species of shrews were collected. The rodent community was dominated by Hylomyscus simus (n = 135), followed by Praomys rostratus (n = 65) and Malacomys edwardsi (n = 18). Crocidura buettikoferi (n = 22) was the most abundant shrew. The species richness and diversity index were higher in drylands than in swamp forests and raphials. Swamp forests showed the highest number of trapped animals (n = 126), followed by the dryland forests (n = 107) and the raphials with 63 individuals. One-way ANOVA test revealed significant differences (p <= 0.05) between the abundance of terrestrial small mammals of the three sampled habitat types. Similarity indices showed that dryland and swamp forests were largely colonised by the same species. Three species are listed as threatened according to the criteria of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Those are one rodent, Hylomyscus baeri, listed as Endangered (EN), and two shrews, Crocidura buettikoferi and Crocidura grandiceps, which are both Near Threatened (NT). This study reinforces the importance of TESF for fauna conservation in Ivory Coast.

J	McGinty, J; Morgan, G; Mott, D				McGinty, Joshua; Morgan, Gaylon; Mott, Dale			Cotton Response to Simulated Hail Damage and Stand Loss in Central Texas	JOURNAL OF COTTON SCIENCE												Hail damage poses a significant threat to many cotton-producing regions in the U.S. Stand reductions, or loss of leaves, stem, and fruit can occur from these events, and growers must make critical management decisions on whether to keep or replant a damaged crop. To address these questions, field trials were conducted near College Station, TX in 2012 to 2014 to investigate the impact of stand loss and node removal on yield under both dryland and irrigated conditions. To simulate stand losses, stands of three different varieties seeded at 111,197 seed ha(-1) were thinned by up to 84%. The critical plant population where yield reductions occurred was inconsistent under irrigated conditions, depending upon the year. Consistent yield losses were experienced only when 84% stand reduction occurred under dryland conditions. To investigate the impact of node removal, field trials were conducted where the upper portions of cotton plants were clipped at 2-, 4-, 8-, 12-, 16-, and 20-node growth stages. Significant yield losses were experienced only when clipping occurred early in the season, between the 2- and 8-node growth stages.																			1523-6919	1524-3303					2019	23	1					1	6																WOS:000504897100001

Oat forage at early dough stage (79 days after sowing) were harvested to assess the biomass yield, nutrient contents, and mineral composition. Oats were ensiled with or without the addition of inoculant and different wilting durations (0, 24, and 48 h) in 3 x 2 factorial arrangement. After the ensiling (120 days), the oat silages were opened, quality was measured in terms of pH, ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), smell, structure, color, and Flieg point. Nutritional composition and feeding values were analyzed in oat silages. Oat grown without irrigation yielded 32 ton/ha fresh matter. Mean dry matter (DM), organic matter, crude protein (CP), crude fiber, crude ash, ether extract, nitrogen free extract, acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent lignin, non-structural carbohydrates, hemicellulose, and in vitro dry matter digestibility of oat forage were 32.77%, 90.41%, 11.31%, 28.69%, 9.59%, 3.99%, 46.43%, 36.32%, 63.98%, 7.22%, 11.14%, 27.67%, and 74.81%, respectively. Addition of inoculant had no effect on the quality, nutritional composition, and feeding values of oat silages. Increasing wilting durations linearly increased the pH (P = 0.005) and decreased the smell score (P = 0.028) of ensiled oat. A linear increase was seen in the DM content of ensiled oat after increasing wilting durations (P = 0.001). Oat ensiled without wilting had greater CP content (P = 0.010 and linear P = 0.011) and lower ADF content than those ensiled after 24 or 48 h of wilting (P = 0.013 and linear P = 0.007). Silages subjected to 24 or 48 h of wilting had lower hemicellulose content (P = 0.019 and linear P = 0.012) and digestible DM (P = 0.013 and linear P = 0.007) than those without wilting. In conclusion, inoculant may not affect the quality, composition and feeding values of ensiled oat grown without irrigation whereas, wilting at different durations may negatively affect the pH, smell, CP, ADF, and feeding values of ensiled oats.

Several statistical models including 16 univariate stability methods and four multivariate models such as the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI), GGE biplot (G+GE biplot), and factorial regression and partial least squares regression were applied to investigate the GE interaction for grain-yield data of 18 durum wheat genotypes grown in 14 environments (location-year combinations). The main objectives were to use the different statistical models to evaluate GE interaction for grain yield in durum wheat and to investigate the effect of some climatic variables on the interactions. The main effect of environment, genotype and GE interactions were significant (p< .01), and accounted for 85.1, 0.8 and 6.8% of total variation, respectively. Using the cluster and discriminant analyses, a pattern map developed simultaneously for clustering of stability methods and genotypes, which allowed identifying seven genotypic groups for genotypes and four groups for stability methods. The different stability groups explained genotypic performance differently, with or without respect to yield. The AMMI stability value, Wricke's ecovalence (Wi), Shukla's stability variance (sigma(2)), Perkins and Jinks's (beta and Dj) indices, joint regression parameters (bi andS(di)(2),R-2) and Tai's stability (sigma and lambda) methods did not correlate with genotypic mean yields, while the dynamic stability GGE distance and superiority measure (Pi) showed significant positive correlations with genotypic mean yields, showing selection based on these two methods would improve yield stability and performance. Using the applied methods, the breeding lines G12, G13 and G7 showed high mean yield and stability performance. The results also showed that the GE interactions were mostly influenced by the climatic data of rainfall, freezing days, minimum temperature and relative humidity. Although the multivariate methods provided valuable information on GE interaction, the univariate methods seem to be useful alternatives to complement improving screening efficiency.

Although numerous of studies have been done to assess its impacts on soil quality and crop yields, the understanding of meso-plastic particles effects on plant is still limited. In this study, low density polyethylene (PE) and biodegradable plastic (Bio) mulch film were selected to study the effects of meso-plastic debris on soybean germination and plant growth with the accumulation levels of 0%, 0.1%, 0.5% and 1% in soil (w: w, size ranging 0.5-2 cm) by a pot experiment under field condition. Results showed that the germination viability of soybean seeds was reduced to 82.39%, 39.44% and 26.06% in the treatments with 0.1%, 0.5% and 1% added plastic debris compared to the control (CK), respectively, suggesting that plastic residues in soil inhibit the viability of soybean seed germination. The plastic debris had a significant negative effect on plant height and culm diameter during the entire growth stage of soybean. Similarly, the leaf area at harvest was reduced by 1.97%, 6.86% and 11.53% compared to the CK in the treatments with 0.1%, 0.5% and 1% plastic debris addition, respectively. In addition, the total plant biomass under plastic addition was reduced in both the flowering and harvesting stages, compared to the CK. For the different type of plastic residues, plant height, leaf area and root/shoot ratio at group PE were significantly lower than those of groups treated by Bio. In conclusion, PE debris had a greater negative effects on plant height, culm diameter, leaf area and root/shoot ratio while Bio debris mainly showed the adverse effects on germination viability and root biomass especially at the flowering stage. Therefore, further research is required to elaborate plastic particles' effects on different stages of crops and soil quality. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Han, Y; Zhao, WW; Ding, JY; Ferreira, CSS				Han, Yi; Zhao, Wenwu; Ding, Jingyi; Ferreira, Carla Sofia Santos			Soil erodibility for water and wind erosion and its relationship to vegetation and soil properties in China's drylands	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Drylands with fragile socio-ecological systems are vulnerable to soil erosion. China's drylands face the dual threat of water (WAE) and wind erosion (WIE). To mitigate soil erosion in drylands, China has implemented numerous ecological restoration measures. However, whether vegetation and soil have different effects on soil erodibility for water erosion (soil erodibility, K) and wind erosion (soil erodible fraction, EF) in drylands is unclear, hindering decision makers to develop suitable ecological restoration strategies. Here, we conducted a large-scale belt transect survey to explore the spatial variation of K and EF in China's drylands, and examined the linear and nolinear effects of aridity (aridity index), vegetation (fractional vegetation cover and below-ground biomass), and soil properties (bulk density, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus) on K and EF. The results showed in China's drylands that the K ranges from 0.02 to 0.07, with high values recorded in the northern Loess Plateau and the eastern Inner Mongolia Plateau. The EF ranges from 0.26 to 0.98, and shows longitudinal zonation with higher values in the east and lower values in the west. Aridity has a negative linear effect on K and an inverse U-shaped nonlinear effect on EF. Aridity can affect K and EF by suppressing vegetation growth and disrupting soil properties. However, K and EF had different responses to some vegetation and soil variables. K and EF had opposite relationships with soil bulk density, and EF was significantly affected by fractional vegetation cover, while K was not. Overall, the effects of aridity and soil properties on soil erodibility were more pronounced than those from vegetation, whose effect on soil erodibility was limited. This study provides relevant information to support reducing soil water and wind erosion by highlighting the hotspot areas of soil erodibility, relevant for implementing vegetation restoration and soil conservation measures in drylands.

This trend is influenced by the rising demand and prices for minerals, along with prevalent poverty levels. Thus, the detrimental impacts of these artisanal mines on the natural environment (i.e., rivers) have remained poorly understood particularly in the Zimbabwean context. To understand the consequences of this situation, a study was conducted in the Umzingwane Catchment, located in southern Zimbabwe, focusing on the variations in water nutrient and metal concentrations in rivers affected by illegal mining activities along their riparian zones. Using multi-year Sentinel-2 composite data and the random forest machine learning algorithm on the Google Earth Engine cloud-computing platform, we mapped the spatial distribution of illegal mines in the affected regions and seven distinct land use classes, including artisanal mines, bare surfaces, settlements, official mines, croplands, and natural vegetation, with an acceptable overall and class accuracies of +/- 70 % were identified. Artisanal mines were found to be located along rivers and this was attributed to their large water requirements needed during the mining process. The water quality analysis revealed elevated nutrient concentrations, such as ammonium and nitrate (range 0.10-20.0 mg L-1), which could be attributed to mine drainage from the use of ammonium nitrate explosives during mining activities. Additionally, the prevalence of croplands in the area may have potentially contributed to increased nutrient concentrations. The principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis revealed three clusters, with one of these clusters showing parameters like Ca, Mg, K, Hg and Na, which are usually associated with mineral gypsum found in the drainage of artisanal mines in the selected rivers. Cluster 2 consisted of B, Cu, Fe, Pb, and Mn, which are likely from the natural environment and finally, cluster 3 contained As, Cd, Cr, and Zn, which were likely associated with both legal and illegal mining operations. These findings provide essential insights into the health of the studied river system and the impacts of human activities in the region. They further serve as a foundation for developing and implementing regulatory measures aimed at protecting riverine systems, in line with sustainable development goal 15.1 which focuses on preserving and conserving terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems, including rivers. By acting on this information, authorities can work towards safeguarding these vital natural resources and promoting sustainable development in the area.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				JAN 10	2024	907								167919	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167919	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167919		OCT 2023						37879464					WOS:001107165300001
J	Li, QR				Li, Qirui			Survey data on livelihood assets, activities and outcomes of smallholder farm households in China's Loess Plateau	DATA IN BRIEF												Smallholders' decisions on land use and their activities and strategies of livelihoods are the critical source of uncertainty in natural resource use and an essential determinant of sustainability challenges. This data article provides a selection of quantitative data from a questionnaire survey on livelihood assets, activities and outcomes of smallholder farm households in Yan'he Township, which lies in the middle part of China's Loess Plateau, one of the representative Grain for Green Project areas [1]. Data include land-use decisions and agronomic practices, fertilisation, use of pesticides, machine and irrigation, farm and non-farm activities, financial performance, and the levels of household income, wellness, and total consumption of food, energy, and education and health care. The survey also covered geographical, demographic and socioeconomic background information on the respondents and their perceptions, incentives, propensities and subjective wellbeing. The survey has supported a couple of research articles that build indicators and indexes for economic, environmental and socio-cultural sustainability dimensions and the resilience building of coupled social-ecological systems. The data presented in this article were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics and provided at the Mendeley Repository. The data will assist studies on the interrelationships of smallholder livelihoods, ecosystem conservation, interventionist policy and market support, and community capacity building in sustainability science.

This takes place despite the threat of dispossession and multiple enclosures associated with the advance of industrial-level wineries and corporate forest plantations. The text analyzes the ways that small winegrowers in the Itata and Cauquenes Valleys protect their heritage and income by integrating interdisciplinary contributions from geology (evaluating climate change manifestations in their valleys), social sciences (observing the care and production practices of the wine-growing commons), and law (analyzing possible legal frameworks to develop in this common defense). All these actions are integrated from an analytical framework of political ecology and climate justice. In these experiences, we recognize multiple elements of climate resilience adapted to the agroecological conditions of dryland farming, showing that wineries are an activity which can protect the local territory and provide climate justice, contributing to protecting cultural heritage and socioenvironmental well-being in communities.

Using a dryland-vegetation model for plant species that display different tradeoffs between fast growth and tolerance to droughts, we find that ecosystems subjected to strong seasonal variability, typical for drylands, exhibit a temporal period-doubling route to chaos that results in early collapse to bare soil. We further find that fast-growing plants go through period doubling sooner and span wider chaotic ranges than stress-tolerant plants. We propose the detection of period-doubling signatures in power spectra as early indicators of ecosystem collapse that outperform existing indicators in their ability to warn against climate extremes and capture the heightened vulnerability of newly-formed drylands. The proposed indicator is expected to apply to other types of ecosystems, such as consumer-resource and predator-prey systems. We conclude by delineating the conditions ecosystems should meet in order for the proposed indicator to apply.

The objective of the current experiment was to quantify irrigation-induced yield loss attributable to Intercepted Photosynthetically Active Radiation (IPAR), Radiation Use Efficiency (RUE) and Harvest Index (HI). For three irrigation treatments (well-watered, over-irrigated, and dryland) during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons, biweekly measurements of predawn leaf water potential (psi(PD)) and light interception were taken along with measurements of biomass, lint yield, fibre quality and harvest index. Irrigation effects on yield were only observed during the 2019 season, and the results showed that psi(PD) remained relatively high in both seasons and was rarely affected by irrigation treatment. A significant reduction in yield was observed for irrigated treatments, despite the dryland producing lower biomass. Any positive effects of IPAR and RUE on lint yield due to excess irrigation were offset by large declines in HI. We conclude that HI was the dominant contributor to yield loss due to excessive irrigation because reduced boll numbers and average boll mass were observed in plots with the greatest total above-ground biomass.

Challenges, solutions and research priorities for sustainable rangelands	RANGELAND JOURNAL												Australia's rangeland communities, industries, and environment are under increasing pressures from anthropogenic activities and global changes more broadly. We conducted a horizon scan to identify and prioritise key challenges facing Australian rangelands and their communities, and outline possible avenues to address these challenges, with a particular focus on research priorities. We surveyed participants of the Australian Rangeland Society 20th Biennial Conference, held in Canberra in September 2019, before the conference and in interactive workshops during the conference, in order to identify key challenges, potential solutions, and research priorities. The feedback was broadly grouped into six themes associated with supporting local communities, managing natural capital, climate variability and change, traditional knowledge, governance, and research and development. Each theme had several sub-themes and potential solutions to ensure positive, long-term outcomes for the rangelands. The survey responses made it clear that supporting 'resilient and sustainable rangelands that provide cultural, societal, environmental and economic outcomes simultaneously' is of great value to stakeholders. The synthesis of survey responses combined with expert knowledge highlighted that sustaining local communities in the long term will require that the inherent social, cultural and natural capital of rangelands are managed sustainably, particularly in light of current and projected variability in climate. Establishment of guidelines and approaches to address these challenges will benefit from: (i) an increased recognition of the value and contributions of traditional knowledge and practices; (ii) development of better governance that is guided by and benefits local stakeholders; and (iii) more funding to conduct and implement strong research and development activities, with research focused on addressing critical knowledge gaps as identified by the local stakeholders. This requires strong governance with legislation and policies that work for the rangelands. We provide a framework that indicates the key knowledge gaps and how innovations may be implemented and scaled out, up and deep to achieve the resilience of Australia's rangelands. The same principles could be adapted to address challenges in rangelands on other continents, with similar beneficial outcomes.

Biocrusts mediate a new mechanism for land degradation under a changing climate	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE												Global concerns for desertification have focused on the slow recovery of extensive and expanding drylands following disturbance, which may be exacerbated by climate change. Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are photosynthetic soil communities found in drylands worldwide, which are central to the stability and resilience of dryland ecosystems, but vulnerable to global change. Here we use multiple decade-long experiments to investigate the consequences of climate and land-use change on biocrusts and soil stability. Biocrusts recovered rapidly under ambient temperatures but warming interacted with the precipitation disturbance to halt recovery. Moreover, warming alone caused losses of mosses, lichens and soil stability. Our results present a new mechanism contributing to land degradation in drylands whereby warming drives a state shift in biocrust communities, which degrades soil stability. The synergistic effects of climate and land-use change co-occur globally and our results support projections of increased desertification and lowered dryland resilience under warming. Land degradation in drylands impacts livelihoods and productivity and is affected by biocrusts that stabilize the soil. Long-term experiments show that biocrust recovery from disturbance is faster than expected, but stopped under warming, with warming alone causing loss of biocrust groups and soil stability.																			1758-678X	1758-6798				JAN	2022	12	1					71	+		10.1038/s41558-021-01249-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41558-021-01249-6		JAN 2022											WOS:000741629200004

More than one-third of Earth's population relies on these ecosystems. Modern observations lack the temporal depth to determine vegetation responses to climate and human activity, but paleoecological and archaeological records can be used to investigate these relationships. Decreasing rainfall across the Late Holocene provides a case study for vegetation response to changing hydroclimate. Rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) middens preserve paleoenvironmental indicators in arid environments where traditional archives are unavailable. Pollen from modern middens collected in Dhofar, Oman, demonstrates the reliability of this archive. Pollen, stable isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15), and microcharcoal data from fossil middens reveal changes in vegetation, relative moisture, and fire from 4000 cal yr BP to the present. Trees limited to moister areas (e.g., Terminalia) today existed farther inland at similar to 3100 cal yr BP. After similar to 2900 cal yr BP, taxa with more xeric affiliations (e.g., Senegalia) had increased. Coprophilous fungal spores (Sporormiella) and grazing indicator pollen revealed an amplified signal of domesticate grazing at similar to 1000 cal yr BP. This indicates that trees associated with semiarid environments were maintained in the interior desert during similar to 3000-4000 yr of decreasing rainfall and that impacts of human activity intensified after the transition to a drier environment.																			0033-5894	1096-0287				NOV	2023	116						12	29		10.1017/qua.2023.42	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/qua.2023.42													WOS:001089108500002

Numerical models for water flow and crop growth can be used to predict crop water stress and make decisions on irrigation management. To this end, a new irrigation scheme was presented to determine the optimum irrigation depths using WASH_2D, a numerical model of water flow and solute transport in soils and crop growth. By using freely available quantitative weather forecasts and volumetric water price as input data to predict soil water flow and give the recommendation of irrigation depths which maximizes net income during each irrigation interval. Field experiments using potato were conducted for two-seasons in a sandy soil in Japan under three irrigation methods, i.e., using the simulation model named treatment "S" (to distinguish, named S1 in first season and S2 in second season), automatic irrigation method using soil moisture sensors named treatment "A", and refilling irrigation management supplying 100% consumed water named treatment "R". To compare S with other two treatments, S1 and A was conducted in the first season, then S2 and R was conducted in the second season. Results showed that S1 improved potato yield by 19%, and reduced water by 28%, resulting in an increased net income by 19% compared with A in the first season. There was no significant difference when compared with R in the second season, which was mainly due to the frequent rainfall during second growing season. In addition, S improved the nitrogen uptake efficiency (NUPE) by 39% and 11% compared with A and R, respectively. The simulated values of water content were in fair agreement with those measured in the root zone. In short, simulated irrigation method was effective in improving yield, saving water and increasing NUPE of potato compared with automatic and refilling irrigation methods in sandy field.

Soil Salinity Type Effects on the Relationship between the Electrical Conductivity and Salt Content for 1:5 Soil-to-Water Extract	SUSTAINABILITY												Soil salinity severely affects soil ecosystem quality and crop production in semi-arid and arid regions. A vast quantity of data on soil salinity has been collected by research organizations of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS, formerly USSR) and many other countries over the last 70 years, but using them in the current international network (irrigation and reclamation strategy) is complicated. This is because in the CIS countries salinity was expressed by total soluble salts as a percentage on a dry-weight basis (total soluble salts, TSS, %) and eight salinity types (chemistry) determined by the ratios of the anions and cations (Cl-, SO42-, HCO3-, and Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+) in diluted soil water extract (soil/water = 1:5) without assessing electrical conductivity (EC). Measuring the EC (1:5) is more convenient, yet EC is not only affected by the concentration but also characteristics of the ions and the salinity chemistry. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between EC and TSS of soils in a diluted extract (1:5) for eight classic salinity types. We analyzed extracts (1:5) of 1100 samples of a clayey soil (0-20 cm) collected from cultivated semi-arid and arid regions for EC, TSS, soluble cations (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+), and anions (HCO3-, Cl-, SO42-). Results revealed that (i) the variation in the proportional relationships (R-2 >= 0.91-0.98) between EC (0.12-5.6 dS m(-1)) and TSS (0.05-2.5%) could be related to salinity type, and (ii) the proportionality coefficient of the relationships (2.2 2-3.16) decreased in the following order of salinity type: SO4 < Cl(SO4)-HCO3 < Cl(HCO3)-SO4 < SO4 (HCO3)-Cl < Cl. The findings suggest that once the salinity type of the soil is established, EC (1:5) values can be safely used for the evaluation of the soil salinity degree in the irrigated land in the context of sustainable soil and crop management.

The first experiment comprised the application of [imazapic + imazapyr] to Clearfield(R) rice. On the following summer cropping season (365 days later), undeformed soil samples 0-5 cm depth were collected and seeds of six species or varieties were sown as bioindicators of residuals (experiment 2), being assessed plant height and dry mass 20 days after emergence start. The third experiment comprised the cultivation of the same species submitted to ten increasing herbicide doses (0-280 g ha(-1)) to establish standard response curves, also assessing plant height and dry mass 20 days after emergence start. About 2.1-5.8% of the applied imazapic remains in soil after one year, for the label doses. Imazapyr was considered to be at negligible doses as its half-life is short, and less than 0.0000001% of the applied dose is expected to be in soil 365 days later. The expected imazapic half-life in lowland areas of Southern Brazil is longer than for dryland, being estimated as between 63 and 77 days (95% confidence interval), contrasting to the 60 days half-life previously estimated for dryland soils.																			0360-1234	1532-4109				JUN 8	2022	57	6					450	457		10.1080/03601234.2022.2063613	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2022.2063613		APR 2022											WOS:000782339300001

All these are vital for national and regional food and nutritional security. Yet, the rainfed drylands have been relatively neglected in mainstream agricultural and rural development policy. As a result, significant social-ecological challenges overlap in these landscapes: endemic poverty, malnutrition and land degradation. Sustainable intensification of dryland agriculture is essential for helping to address these challenges, particularly in the context of accelerating climate change. In this paper, we present 100 questions that point to the most important knowledge gaps and research priorities. If addressed, these would facilitate and inform sustainable intensification in Indian rainfed drylands, leading to improved agricultural production and enhanced ecosystem services. The horizon scanning method used to produce these questions brought together experts and practitioners involved in a broad range of disciplines and sectors.

Taking the agro-pastoral transitional zone of northern China (APTZNC) as an example, this paper developed an approach of sustainable urban landscape planning (SULP) under the stress of climate change in the DNC. First, we quantify the amount of water resources under the future climate change impacts (CCI). Then, we adjust the urban land area based on water resources carrying capacity constraints. Finally, we use the LUSD-urban (Land Use Scenario Dynamics-urban) model to adjust the configuration of the urban landscape to avoid occupying important natural habitats and corridors, prime croplands, and floodplains. We find that the SULP can effectively mitigate the comprehensive effects of regional urban landscape dynamics on water resources, food security, ecological security, and flood risks. By performing the SULP, prime croplands, floodplains, and important natural habitats and corridors occupied by urban land will decrease by 2,187 km(2), 750 km(2), and 130 km(2), respectively, during the period of 2015-2050 in the APTZNC. We also find that the proposed approach can effectively manage the impacts of climate change on water resource capacity and reduce water stress of the entire APTZNC and its sub-regions. Thus, the proposed SULP approach and the experiences from the case study in the APTZNC are helpful for guiding urban landscape planning to achieve sustainable development of cities in the DNC and even in the drylands around the world.

However, the impacts of N deposition and its interaction with soil moisture on soil seed bank remain largely unknown in semiarid grasslands. Here, we quantified the effects of two soil water regimes (HW: watered to field capacity every day; LW: watered to field capacity every 2 days) and two types of N addition (NO3--N and NH4+-N) with different levels on seed bank germination in two separate trials in April and July 2015 in a semiarid grassland on the Loess Plateau, China. Results showed seed bank germination was remarkably inhibited under the LW soil water regime. Species composition of emerged seedlings significantly differed between the two soil water regimes. N addition promoted seed bank germination under the HW soil water regime. This promoting effect was less noticeable under the LW, while still significant in the high level of NH4+-N in the July trial. N addition did not alter the species composition of emerged seedlings. Overall, this study suggests that soil moisture controls soil seed bank germination and species composition of emerged seedlings. Soil N addition, for example, by N deposition, greatly promotes soil seed bank germination when soil moisture is high (e.g., during seed germination season in July), and still marginally facilitates seed germination under low soil moisture conditions (e.g., at the beginning of the growing season in April). N deposition may therefore deplete the grassland soil seed bank if other processes (e.g., seed input) remain unchanged.

In Europe, most of the dryland areas are devoted to agriculture. In the next decades, both European and worldwide drylands are expected to suffer with increased intensity due to the expected climate change-derived rise in aridity. Many studies have focussed on aridity-induced changes in major nutrients in drylands, but little is known of the impact of environmental and biogeochemical factors on micronutrients with critical roles in life, and as inorganic contaminants with ecotoxicological implications. We analysed and explored drivers of total and available concentrations of micronutrients (Co, Cu, Fe, Mo, Mn, Ni and Zn) and contaminants (As, Cd and Pb) in 148 soil samples collected from European drylands covering a wide range of aridity and of other geochemical parameters. The availability of micronutrients increased with their total content, decreased with pH and was enhanced by organic C content. Aridity decreased the availability of Fe, a key element in human diet. Our findings also highlight the scarcity of this micronutrient in European drylands, as well as of some other important micronutrients like Zn and Mo in agricultural soils. Total content was the main driver of the availability of Cd and Pb, and organic matter exerted synergistic effects on contaminant release. Our data show the need for precise management practices to be incentivised by agricultural and environmental policies in order to ensure micronutrient supply and avoid contamination, thus maintaining adequate levels of agricultural productivity and simultaneously preserving dryland ecosystems. Highlights Drylands are important for food production in Europe and sensitive to climate change. The occurrence of metals in European Union dry soils and the drivers influencing them were studied. Some micronutrients (Fe, Mo and Zn) were scarce while contaminants were abundant. SOC, pH and clays were the main drivers of element availability; aridity reduced Fe. Agricultural practises are needed to ensure nutrient supply and prevent contamination.

Advances in Understanding and Managing Catastrophic Ecosystem Shifts in Mediterranean Ecosystems	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												One of the most challenging issues in Mediterranean ecosystems to date has been to understand the emergence of discontinuous changes or catastrophic shifts. In the era of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, which encompass ideas around Land Degradation Neutrality, advancing this understanding has become even more critical and urgent. The aim of this paper is to synthesize insights into the drivers, processes and management of catastrophic shifts to highlight ways forward for the management of Mediterranean ecosystems. We use a multidisciplinary approach that extends beyond the typical single site, single scale, single approach studies in the current literature. We link applied and theoretical ecology at multiple scales with analyses and modeling of human-environment-climate relations and stakeholder engagement in six field sites in Mediterranean ecosystems to address three key questions: i) How do major degradation drivers affect ecosystem functioning and services in Mediterranean ecosystems? i i) What processes happen in the soil and vegetation during a catastrophic shift? ii i) How can management of vulnerable ecosystems be optimized using these findings? Drawing together the findings from the use of different approaches allows us to address the whole pipeline of changes from drivers through to action. We highlight ways to assess ecosystem vulnerability that can help to prevent ecosystem shifts to undesirable states; identify cost-effective management measures that align with the vision and plans of land users; and evaluate the timing of these measures to enable optimization of their application before thresholds are reached. Such a multidisciplinary approach enables improved identification of early warning signals for discontinuous changes informing more timely and cost-effective management, allowing anticipation of, adaptation to, or even prevention of, undesirable catastrophic ecosystem shifts.

J	Tatsumi, C; Taniguchi, T; Du, S; Yamanaka, N; Tateno, R				Tatsumi, Chikae; Taniguchi, Takeshi; Du, Sheng; Yamanaka, Norikazu; Tateno, Ryunosuke			The steps in the soil nitrogen transformation process vary along an aridity gradient via changes in the microbial community	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Rainfall patterns are predicted to change dramatically in many terrestrial landscapes, including drylands. The most limiting resources for plant growth in arid regions is nitrogen (N) as well as water. A natural aridity gradient provides appropriate candidate conditions for predicting the impacts of changes in rainfall on soil N dynamics. To comprehensively and mechanistically examine soil N dynamics, we focused on the steps of N transformation, their microbial drivers, and the determining soil properties. We divided the N transformation process into three steps: (i) organic matter degradation, (ii) N mineralization, and (iii) nitrification, which are driven primarily by fungi, prokaryotes, and ammonia oxidizers, respectively. Soil samples were collected from three black locust forests with mean annual precipitations ranging from 449 to 606mm. Along the aridity gradient, all three steps changed while maintaining a balance. The degradation and mineralization steps varied with changes in the soil fungal and prokaryotic communities, respectively. The compositions of these communities were determined by soil substrate quality and quantity; saprotrophs and copiotrophs decreased along the aridity gradient. On the other hand, the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, which correlated with the rate of nitrification, was likely determined by soil moisture. Therefore, if precipitation were to decrease, changes in the nitrification step might be the first mechanism to limit plant productivity in semi-arid forests. This limitation would extend to the other steps in the N cycling process via plant-soil feedback. Thus, N cycling dynamics are predicted to achieve new stable states suited to the changed precipitation regime.					taniguchi, takeshi/AAG-5450-2021; Taniguchi, Takeshi/C-9364-2019; Norikazu, Yamanaka/D-4628-2019; DU, SHENG/A-7528-2008	taniguchi, takeshi/0000-0001-7386-1117; DU, SHENG/0000-0002-5580-399X; Tateno, Ryunosuke/0000-0001-8461-3696; Tatsumi, Chikae/0000-0001-7191-6049; Yamanaka, Norikazu/0000-0003-4997-4060													0168-2563	1573-515X				JUN	2019	144	1					15	29		10.1007/s10533-019-00569-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-019-00569-2													WOS:000470700200002

Soil surface disturbance alters cyanobacterial biocrusts and soil properties in dry grassland and shrubland ecosystems	PLANT AND SOIL												Aims Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) dominate soil surfaces in drylands, providing services that include soil stabilization and carbon uptake. In this study, we investigated the direct and biocrust-mediated effects of anthropogenic disturbances in two dryland ecosystems. Methods We applied low intensity soil surface disturbance (twice-yearly footfalls) in grassland and shrubland ecosystems in northern Chihuahuan Desert, USA. Results After five years of disturbance, biocrust photosynthetic capacity (chlorophyll a) declined by 44%. Declines were largest in interspaces between grassland plants. Levels of scytonemin, a biocrust sunscreen pigment, were 38% greater in shrubland than grassland and 44% greater under grass canopy than in interspaces, but decreased only 5% with disturbance. Disturbance reduced soil surface stability 2 times more in the grassland than shrubland. Disturbance effects on other hydrologic and physical properties were indirectly mediated by the photosynthetic capacity of biocrusts. Disturbance indirectly increased infiltration depth and shallow (2-3 cm) soil moisture in the grassland but reduced surface moisture (<1 cm) in the shrubland. Conclusions Biocrusts were more sensitive to low intensity soil disturbance in a grassland than shrubland ecosystem. While biocrusts mediated the effects of soil disturbance on dryland soil hydrological and physical properties, the nature of their influence differed between ecosystem types.

This massive die-back, which has particularly affected the predominant shrub species Noaea mucronata, predominates edaphically homogeneous (low geodiversity) hillslopes, and is minor in edaphically heterogeneous (high geodiversity) hillslopes. While the homogeneous hillslopes encompass a thick and non-stony soil layer, the heterogeneous hillslopes are composed of a thin, stony layer that overlies weathered, chalky bedrock. The objective of this geophysical study was to assess the subsurface and bedrock characteristics, and its effect on shrub durability vs mass mortality in a dryland ecosystem. A combination of 2D and 3D Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) imaging and Frequency Domain Electromagnetics (FDEM) was applied. For the GPR procedure, the 2D and 3D reflection imaging was dominated by different dielectric permittivities (dielectric constants) of layers and changes in soil-rock-water content. For the FDEM procedure, the soil-rock electrical properties, alongside the concentration of dissolved salts, determined the measured electrical conductivity (EC). The results show substantial differences in EC values between the homogeneous and heterogeneous hillslopes, which are attributed to differences in the soil-rock interface, soil-water content, and salts concentration. Overall, the much greater EC values of the soil-rock interface in the heterogeneous hillslopes are expected to adversely affect shrub vitality. However, the greater shrub vitality in these hillslopes is likely attributed to the fractured and weathered chalky underground, which retains moisture in pockets or micro-aquicludes that increase water availability for the shrubs. Under these better habitat conditions of the heterogeneous hillslopes, the high EC values do not limit shrub survival or growth. At the same time, the absence of such water pockets in the thick soil layer of the homogeneous hillslopes imposes severe stress under long-term drought conditions, resulting in shrub die-off. This study illustrates the vital role of subsurface geodiversity in determining the resilience of dryland ecosystems to droughts and climatic change.

ASSESSING THE EFFECTS OF A WINTER WHEAT COVER CROP ON SOIL WATER USE, COTTON YIELD, AND SOIL ORGANIC CARBON IN NO-TILL COTTON PRODUCTION SYSTEMS	JOURNAL OF THE ASABE												Cover crops provide many soil health benefits to agricultural systems. An interest in growing cover crops in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production systems has been increasing in the Texas Rolling Plains (TRP) region. Due to limited rainfall and groundwater availability, producers in this semi-arid region are concerned that winter cover crops can reduce soil water availability for a subsequent cotton crop. In addition, the long-term effects of cover crops on soil organic carbon (SOC) are not well studied in this region. The overall goal of this study was to assess the long-term effects of growing a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) cover crop on soil water, SOC, seed cotton yield, and crop water productivity (CWP) under irrigated and dryland cotton production systems using the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) model. Measured data from cover crop experiments conducted at the Texas A&M AgriLife Research Station at Chillicothe from 2011 to 2020 were used to evaluate the CROPGRO-Cotton and CERES-Wheat modules in the DSSAT Cropping System Model. The average percent error (PE) between the simulated and measured seed cotton yield was 0.3% and-0.9%, and that between the simulated and measured aboveground wheat biomass was 1.4% and-3.4% during the calibration and evaluation periods, respectively. For the simulation of SOC, the PE was 8.5% and 7.6% during the calibra-tion and evaluation periods, respectively. Long-term (2001 to 2020) simulations showed that soil water was reduced sub-stantially by the winter wheat cover crop before its termination. However, depleted soil water was quickly replenished by spring precipitation and maintained at a higher level during the cotton growing season. Winter wheat cover crops can potentially improve SOC in irrigated and dryland cotton production systems. The CWP of cotton also improved with a winter wheat cover crop under both irrigated and dryland conditions. We concluded that cover crops could potentially improve soil health and provide a sustainable environment for TRP cotton production.

J	He, NA; Gao, XD; Zhao, LH; Hu, P; Zhao, XN				He, Nana; Gao, Xiaodong; Zhao, Lianhao; Hu, Pan; Zhao, Xining			Modeling root water uptake patterns of oil crops grown on semiarid loess	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Oil crops are often used as cover crops by smallholders managing orchards on drylands, because they have an economic return and help regulate ecosystem services. Improving the ability of models in root water uptake (RWU) simulation is important to find the right crop species and predict the dynamics of these oil crops in water -limited regions. In this study, two different process-based models were used to simulate the RWU of three oil crops, i.e. soybean (Glycine max L., SYB) and two canola cultivars (turnip type rape (Brassica campestris L.), TTR, and cabbage type rape (Brassica napus L.), CTR), grown on the semiarid Loess Plateau of China, based on two-year in-situ measurements. The first model, IM-SVD, was developed by inverse modeling (IM) of the Richards equation and incorporating singular value decomposition (SVD) parameter optimization algorithms, which simulated the RWU pattern (including soil evaporation and plant transpiration). The second model was the Feddes model implemented in one-dimensional HYDRUS (HYDRUS 1-D). Both models reliably predicted the soil water content (SWC) in different layers. However, the IM-SVD model showed better modeling accuracy of SWC, and produced higher simulated RWU values than the HYDRUS 1-D model irrespective of crop. The results from both models implied that SYB had a higher daily and seasonal RWU than TTR and CTR, and its water source was derived mainly from the top 30 cm soil layer. Additionally, the simulated RWU was positively and significantly (p<0.05) correlated with fine root length density (FRLD). The RWU showed lagged correlations with SWC, which varied between crop species and growth stages, but overall were more positively correlated with the SWC on preceding days and more negatively correlated with the SWC on subsequent days. Our study provides insights into the improving RWU simulation for oil crops and similar crops in drylands.																			0168-1923	1873-2240				MAR 1	2023	330								109306	10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.109306	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.109306		JAN 2023											WOS:000921503400001

Soil rock content influences the maximum seedling emergence depth of a dominant arid zone grass	PLANT AND SOIL												Aims We aimed to understand the influence of differing soil rock content on seedling emergence of a dominant arid zone grass critical to mine restoration (Triodia pungens R.Br.). We assessed whether emergence mortality resulting from seedlings failing to navigate rocky soils contributes meaningfully to failed recruitment and the maximum emergence depth. Methods Cleaned seeds and florets (the natural dispersal unit) were buried at discrete depths of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 mm in three soil-rock matrices of varying rock content (soil sieved to <5 mm, sieved to <25 mm, or left un-sieved). Results Rock content reduced emergence of seeds buried below 15 mm and truncated the maximum emergence depth. When seeds were buried at 5 mm; near the modelled 6.0 mm optimal depth, any failure to emerge was largely attributable to failed seed germination. However, when seeds were buried greater than 20 mm, failure of pre-emergent seedlings to reach the surface became the significant factor contributing to failed emergence. Florets failed to recruit under all scenarios. Conclusions Soil rock content can influence critical seed germination and emergence life stages and therefore the optimal seed recruitment depth. Emergence of deeply (>20 mm) buried seeds is likely restricted by rocks imposing a physical barrier to recruitment.

A study was conducted to evaluate the effects of cropland and grassland management systems on soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (N) across the soil profile (0-20, 20-40, 40-60, and 60-80 cm) and microbial community size, structure, and activity in the soil surface (0-20 cm) as indicators of soil health. Cropland systems compared included conventional-tilled wintergrazed cropland (CTGC) and no-tilled and strip-tilled croplands (NTC and STC) without livestock grazing. Grassland systems included grazed grassland (GGL) and ungrazed grassland (UGL). Grassland soils accumulated 18% greater SOC and 13% greater total N than cropland soils in the 0-80 cm profile. Microbial community size (sum of ester-linked fatty acid methyl esters [El-FAME]) in the surface 0-20 cm was 90% greater, and enzyme activities were 131-155% greater in the grasslands than in the croplands. Within grasslands, cattle (Bos taurus) grazing increased microbial community size by approximately 42%, which was mainly due to greater fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) markers for gram-positive bacteria (51%) and Actinobacteria (73%). Grazed cropland had 95% more beta-glucosaminidase activity than ungrazed croplands. This study suggests light grazing and grassland restoration has potential to improve soil health and resilience through an increase in SOC and microbial community responses related to nutrient cycling.

Venku; Ricart, Sandra			Farmers' Distress Index: An Approach for an Action Plan to Reduce Vulnerability in the Drylands of India	LAND												Farmer distress is a widely recognized problem in India induced by multiple causes ranging from climate variability to price volatility and the low risk-bearing ability of farmers. Tracking farmers' distress in a localized context is a prerequisite for timely action to provide sustainable livelihood options. Therefore, a field survey was conducted with 640 dryland farmers of 10 sub-district units from two states in India with the aim to identify the major indicators based on seven dimensions of distress and to construct a multidimensional Farmers' Distress Index (FDI) at the farmer and sub-district levels. The FDI was built with seven dimensions of distress: exposure to risk, adaptive capacity, sensitivity, mitigation and adaptation strategies, triggers, psychological factors, and impacts. The study developed a broad-based FDI which can be used as a planning tool that can address the causes of farmers' distress and also evolve measures to tackle those causes. Based on the result, the study recommends a location-specific distress management package based on various dimensions of the FDI. The paper also suggests an upscaling strategy to identify and prioritize the highly distressed farmers as well as sub-district geographical units by tracking a few sets of variables.

Intercropping is accepted as a highly sustainable system to reduce soil erosion and ensure sustainable production by making efficient use of resources. Field experiments were conducted in the rainy season (July to September) during 2015, 2016, and 2017 to evaluate the effect of land slopes and maize and cowpea strip-intercropping on productivity and resource conservation at the Regional Research Station, Ballowal Saunkhri located in the Shivalik foothills. During three years of experimentation, a total of 23-26 runoff events were observed in the maize crop grown in the rainy season. The results from this 3-year field study indicate that maize grain yield was significantly higher on a 1% slope and cowpea on a 2% slope. This accounted for significantly higher net returns (US$ 428 ha(-1)) with a benefit-cost (BC) ratio of 2.0 on a 1% slope. Runoff, soil, and nutrient losses were higher on a 3% slope as compared to 1% and 2% slopes. N, P, and K loss on a 3% slope were 3.80, 1.82, and 4.10 kg ha(-1) higher, respectively than a 1% slope. The adoption of a strip-intercropping system with a 4.8 m maize strip width and 1.2 m cowpea strip width resulted in significantly higher maize equivalent yield than sole maize and other strip-intercropping systems. This system showed the highest land equivalent ratio value (1.24) indicating a 24% yield advantage over sole cropping systems of maize and cowpea, and fetched the highest net returns (US$ 530 ha(-1)) with a benefit-cost ratio (BC ratio) of 2.09. This system also reduced runoff and soil loss by 10.9% and 8.3%, respectively than sole maize crop. On all the land slopes, maize and cowpea strip-intercropping systems showed a significant reduction in N, P, K, and organic carbon loss as compared to sole maize. Thus, on sloping land, the maize and cowpea strip-intercropping system decreases surface runoff, soil, and nutrient loss, and increases yield and income of the farmers as compared to a sole maize crop.

J	Do, Y; Choi, MB				Do, Yuno; Choi, Moon Bo			Network analysis for co-occurrence of pest insects on host crops	ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH												In this study, the co-occurrence patterns of 618 pest insects for 47 host crops, including vegetables, grains, and fruits, were identified. To identify the pest co-occurrence patterns for various crops, and the interactions among the pest insects and crops, we employed social network analysis methods. We used three traditional centrality measures (degree, closeness, and eigenvector) to determine the relative significance of each crop and pest as a node in the network. Throughout the network analysis, crops and pest nodes were divided into six groups, based on modularity. Crops in the same group could be considered as alternate hosts for pests from the same group. There were clear differences in the cultural practices between groups (i.e., dryland farming versus wetland farming). This indicated that dryland crop pests do not use wetland crops as resources. Pome fruit trees, such as apple and pear, had high centrality indices, which indicated the importance of these crops in the network and their high vulnerability to damage by a multitude of pests. In this study, although it was assumed that all crops were cultivated on the same piece of land during a single growing season, the complex interactions between the whole units were visualized and analyzed as a computable network.																			1738-2297	1748-5967				JAN	2019	49	1					35	45		10.1111/1748-5967.12333	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1748-5967.12333													WOS:000456177300005

Shrad	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Plant adaptation to salinity is a highly multifaceted process, harnessing various physiological mechanisms depending on the severity and duration of salt stress. This study focuses on the effects of 4- and 10-day treatments with low (100 mM NaCl) and moderate (200 mM NaCl) salinity on growth, CO2/H2O gas exchange, stomatal apparatus performance, the efficiency of photosystems I and II (PS I and II), content of key C-4 photosynthesis enzymes, and the accumulation of Na+, K+, and proline in shoots of the widespread forage C-4 halophyte Kochia prostrata. Our data show that 4 days of low salinity treatment resulted in a decrease in biomass, intensity of apparent photosynthesis, and cyclic electron transport around PS I. It was accompanied by an increase in transpiration and Rubisco and PEPC contents, while the Na+ and proline contents were low in K. prostrata shoots. By the 10th day of salinity, Na+ and proline have accumulated; PS I function has stabilized, while PS II efficiency has decreased due to the enhanced non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence (NPQ). Thus, under low salinity conditions, Na+ accumulated slowly and the imbalance between light and dark reactions of photosynthesis was observed. These processes might be induced by an early sodium signaling wave that affects cellular pH and ion homeostasis, ultimately disturbing photosynthetic electron transport. Another adaptive reaction more "typical" of salt-tolerant species was observed at 200 mM NaCl treatment. It proceeds in two stages. First, during the first 4 days, dry biomass and apparent photosynthesis decrease, whereas stomata sensitivity and dissipation energy during dark respiration increase. In parallel, an active Na+ accumulation and a decreased K+/Na+ ratio take place. Second, by the 10th day, a fully-fledged adaptive response was formed, when growth and apparent photosynthesis stabilized and stomata closed. Decreased dissipation energy, increased WUE, stabilization of Rubisco and PEPC contents, and decreased proline content testify to the completion of the adaptation and stabilization of the physiological state of plants. The obtained results allowed us to conclude that the formation of a full-fledged salt-tolerant response common for halophytes in K. prostrata occurs by the 10th day of moderate salinity.					, Z.Rakhmankulova/AAN-1058-2021	Voronin, Pavel/0000-0002-2239-2506													1664-462X					OCT 7	2022	13								955880	10.3389/fpls.2022.955880	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.955880								36275591					WOS:000874682000001

Assessment of foliar-applied phosphorus fertiliser formulations to enhance phosphorus nutrition and grain production in wheat	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE												The ability to utilise foliar-applied phosphorus (P) as a strategy to increase the P status and yield of grain crops grown in dryland regions with variable climates is attractive. Several P formulations with varying pH, accompanying cations and adjuvants were tested for their effectiveness as foliar fertilisers for wheat (Triticum aestivumL.) plants, first under controlled and then under field conditions. Experiments under controlled conditions suggested that several formulations with specific chemistries offered promise with respect to wheat fertiliser-P recovery and biomass responses. These formulations were then evaluated in two field experiments, and although wheat grown at the sites showed substantive responses to soil-applied P, there was no significant grain-yield response to foliar-applied P. Following the limited responses to foliar-applied fertiliser in the field, we used an isotopic dilution technique to test the hypothesis that the variation in responses of wheat to foliar addition of P could be explained by a mechanism of substitution, whereby root P uptake is downregulated when P is taken up through the leaves, but this was proven not to be the case. We conclude that foliar P application cannot be used as a tactical fertiliser application to boost grain yield of wheat in dryland regions.

This physiognomic shift is often ascribed to changes in climate (e.g. precipitation) and disturbance regimes (e.g. grazing and fire), but this remains debated. Aeolian processes are known to impact resource distribution in drylands, but their potential role in grassland-to-shrubland state changes has received little attention. <bold> </bold>We quantified the effects of 'sandblasting' (abrasive damage by wind-blown soil) on the ecophysiology of dryland grass vs shrub functional types using a portable wind tunnel to test the hypothesis that grasses would be more susceptible to sandblasting than shrubs and, thus, reinforce transitions to shrub dominance in wind-erodible grasslands when climate-or disturbance-induced reductions in ground cover occur. <bold> </bold>Grasses and shrubs responded differently to sandblasting, wherein water-use efficiency declined substantially in grasses, but only slightly in shrubs, owing to grasses having greater increases in day/nighttime leaf conductance and transpiration. <bold> </bold>The differential ecophysiological response to sandblasting exhibited by grass and shrub functional types could consequently alter the vegetation dynamics in dryland grasslands in favour of the xerophytic shrubs. Sandblasting could thus be an overlooked driver of shrub encroachment in wind-erodible grasslands.

Druce in the drylands of Southern and Western Asia	BOTANY LETTERS												Trees of the Mimosoideae are dominant species in hot subdesert areas worldwide, providing many services for ecosystems and humans. This group includes Prosopis cineraria (L.) Druce, a dominant species from the dryland forests of Southern and Western Asia. Human population density and activities in these arid areas have led to calls for an urgent consideration of ecosystem services and conservation biodiversity. We performed a literature review on P. cineraria, to determine how this species could contribute to ecosystem conservation, ecosystem restoration, and improving ecosystem services in its native distribution range. Prosopis cineraria is at the heart of a network of intricate interactions with biotic and abiotic factors in its environment. Water mobilization, nitrogen fixation, soil stabilization, and the shade and resources provided by P. cineraria are key elements in the consideration of this species for conservation programs. Moreover, P. cineraria is deeply entrenched in local culture and history. It is part of the local cultural identity and provides remedies, agro-ecological, recreational, and regulating services, such as protecting dunes against erosion. Prosopis cineraria is of huge ethnobotanical value in subdesert areas in its native range. Dryland forest conservation strategies could benefit greatly from targeting this species, and should be accompanied by research in the potential of P. cineraria for coping with climate change.																			2381-8107	2381-8115				JAN 2	2022	169	1					30	42		10.1080/23818107.2021.1981437	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23818107.2021.1981437		OCT 2021											WOS:000708730200001

The present research has identified a family of 31 TPP genes in Triticum aestivum L. through homology searches and classified them into five clades by phylogenetic tree analysis, providing evidence of an evolutionary status with Hordeum vulgare, Brachypodium distachyon and Oryza sativa. The exon-intron distribution revealed a discrete evolutionary history and projected possible gene duplication occurrences. Furthermore, different computational approaches were used to analyze the physical and chemical properties, conserved domains and motifs, subcellular and chromosomal localization, and three-dimensional (3-D) protein structures. Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) analysis predicted that TaTPP promoters consist of CREs related to plant growth and development, hormones, and stress. Transcriptional analysis revealed that the transcription levels of TaTPPs were variable in different developmental stages and organs. In addition, qRT-PCR analysis showed that different TaTPPs were induced under salt and drought stresses and during leaf senescence. Therefore, the findings of the present study give fundamental genomic information and possible biological functions of the TaTPP gene family in wheat and will provide the path for a better understanding of TaTPPs involvement in wheat developmental processes, stress tolerance, and leaf senescence.

We designed two contrast methods to induce nHRS in two wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes released in different decades under pot-culture conditions. Partial root-zone stress (PS) was performed using the method of split-root alternative water supply (one half wetting and the other drying) to induce the continuous operation of nHRS, and full root-zone stress (FS) was subjected to whole root system to periodic operation of nHRS. nHRS-mediated signalling increased abscisic acid (ABA) production and triggered ROS (reactive oxygen species) generation, which, thereby, led to up-regulation of antioxidant defense system. Cytokinin synthesis reduced during drought stress while proline and malodialdehyde (MDA) content were increased. Regardless of drought treatment methods and wheat genotype, a significant decrease in grain yield, root biomass and above-ground biomass (p < 0.05) was observed, without significant changes in root-to-shoot ratio. Harvest index was increased, proposing that more energy was allocated to reproductive organs during the action of nHRS. Moreover, higher water use efficiency was witnessed in PS. The data suggest that nHRS triggered ABA accumulation, thereby closing stomata, and reducing water use and also decreases the production of ROS and improves the antioxidant defence enzymes, thus enhancing drought tolerance. This survey of different-decade genotypes suggests that advances in grain yield and drought tolerance would be made by targeted selection for a wheat genetic resource.

This study determined the suitability of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) genotypes to alleviate protein, Zn and Fe deficiency under water-scarce dryland conditions through evaluation of NWP. Sorghum genotypes (Macia, Ujiba, PAN8816, IsiZulu) NWP was quantified from three planting seasons for various sorghum seed nutrients under dryland semi-arid conditions. Seasons by genotypes interaction highly and significantly affected NWPStarch, Ca, Cu, Fe, and significantly affected NWPMg, K, Na, P, Zn. Genotypic variations highly and significantly affected sorghum NWPProtein, Mn. Macia exhibited statistically superior NWPprotein (13.2-14.6 kg.m(-3)) and NWPZn (2.0-2.6 g.m(-3)) compared to other tested genotypes, while Macia NWPFe (2.6-2.7 g.m(-3)) was considerably inferior to that of Ujiba and IsiZulu landraces under increased water scarcity. Excellent overall NWPprotein, Fe and Zn under water scarcity make Macia a well-rounded genotype suitable to alleviating food and nutritional insecurity challenges in semi-arid SSA; however, landraces are viable alternatives with limited NWPprotein and Zn penalty under water-limited conditions. These results underline genotype selection as a vital tool in improving "nutrition per drop" in semi-arid regions.

Woody plant encroachment of grassland and the reversibility of shrub dominance: Erosion, fire, and feedback processes	ECOSPHERE												Many grass-dominated ecosystems in dryland regions have experienced increasing woody plant density and abundance during the past century. In many cases, this process has led to land degradation and declines in ecosystem functions. An example is the Chihuahuan Desert in the southwestern United States, which experienced different stages of shrub encroachment in the past 150 years. Among a wide variety of mechanisms to explain the grass-shrub transitions in this dryland system, soil erosion (both wind and water) and fire are particularly well studied. Here, we synthesize recent developments on the drivers and feedback in the process of shrub encroachment in the Chihuahuan Desert through the intercomparison of two Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites, namely Jornada and Sevilleta. Experimental and modeling studies support a conceptual framework, which underscores the important roles of erosion and fire in woody plant encroachment. Collectively, research at the Jornada LTER provided complementary, quantitative support to the well-known fertile-islands framework. Studies at the Sevilleta LTER expanded the framework, adding fire as a major disturbance to woody plants. Conceptual models derived from the synthesis represent the general understanding of shrub encroachment that emerged from research at these two sites, and can guide management interventions aimed at reducing or mitigating undesirable ecosystem state change in many other drylands worldwide.

Long-range, high-resolution stratigraphic correlation of Rotliegend fluvial-fan deposits in the central Dutch offshore	MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												The Rotliegend feather-edge area in the central part of the endorheic Southern Permian Basin in the Dutch offshore is characterized by a predominance of mud-prone, evaporite-bearing playa and lake deposits with a subordinate amount of interbedded, thin, fluvial sheet sandstones. The distribution and lateral facies changes of the sandstone bodies have been analyzed by generating a long-range, high-resolution chronostratigraphic correlation framework. The correlation technique of pattern matching of GR logs was applied, supported by calculating spectral trend curves. Flooding events are the primary near-synchronous correlation surfaces, which can be traced up to and over 100 km. The basin setting of the Southern Permian Basin, the studied sandstone depositional architecture (logs) and sedimentary characteristics (core) are analogous to the depositional setting of laterally-amalgamated terminal lobes of dryland-river systems in an endorheic basin, such as the Holocene Altiplano Basin in Bolivia, present-day Lake Eyre (Australia) and the Miocene Ebro Basin (Spain). The integrated approach has yielded a stratigraphic reservoir-architecture framework in which the reservoir sandstones, with net sand up to 10 m, have been identified as amalgamated terminal-splay sandstone sheets formed at the end of dryland-river pathways, alternating with lacustrine mudstone layers deposited during short-duration, high-magnitude flooding in intermittent wet climate periods.

Complex (Asteraceae) in Japan	ACTA PHYTOTAXONOMICA ET GEOBOTANICA												Repeated adaptation to similar environments can lead to divergence of phenotypes in different populations. Such evolutionary changes sometimes result in incongruence between morphology and molecular phylogeny, for which careful biological investigation is required. Natural phenotypic variation in rheophytic populations of the Solidago virgaurea L. complex (Asteraceae), which evolved multiple times from ancestral dryland forms in Japan, are here reported. Common garden experiments and population genetic analysis were used to evaluate the extent to which parallelly evolved rheophytes diverged in morphological, phenological and genotypic features to understand their complex evolutionary history. Significant divergence among rheophytic populations was detected in multiple traits, even in leaf morphological traits, which are similarly subjected to purifying selection by water pressure in riparian habitats. Whereas most of the variation were attributed to differences between specific pairs of populations, flowering phenology showed latitudinal variation, which likely evolved along a large-scale environmental cline. Multivariate analysis revealed that at least the population on Okinawa Isl., at the edge of the range of the species, is phenotypically distinguishable from rheophytic populations on the main islands. Phylogenetic analysis also suggested that the Okinawan rheophytes are genetically isolated from parapatric dryland populations. Based on the evidence, the Okinawan rheophytic plants are recognized as specifically distinct and are described as Solidago yambaruensis S. Sakaguchi & Mot. Ito.

Therefore, nutrient management to mitigate the negative K budget is urgently required. Therefore, we aimed to exploit the abundance of K in gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) to substitute the fertilizer K requirement to improve soil quality and sustain cotton productivity. Results indicated a significant (p < 0.05) improvement in soil physical properties and organic carbon under treatment 100% NP + 10 kg K (inorganic) + 20 kg K (gliricidia) (T-4). The same treatment had 18.2 and 11.4, 36.22 and 4.7, and 17.8 and 9% higher content of available N, P, and K compared to the control and 100% RDF, respectively. Available micronutrients and biological properties were significantly higher under treatment T-4 and 100% NP + 15 kg K (inorganic) + 15 kg K (gliricidia) (T-3). Hydraulic conductivity, organic carbon, and microbial biomass carbon were identified as key SQ indicators for the experimental soil. The treatments T-3 and T-4 had about 105 and 122% more seed cotton yield compared to the control and 17 and 27% more than 100% RDF treatment (T-2). We conclude that gliricidia can be efficiently utilized in the nutrient management packages to partially substitute the fertilizer K requirement of rainfed cotton. This will further address the K depletion and nutrient imbalances and help to restore the soil K in shrink-swell soils of Central India.

Like other biomes, drylands face increasing pressure from global change, but many of these ecosystems are close to tipping points, which, if crossed, can lead to abrupt transitions and persistent degraded states. Their limited but variable precipitation, low soil fertility, and low productivity have given rise to a perception that drylands are wastelands, needing societal intervention to bring value to them. Negative perceptions of drylands synergistically combine with conflicting sociocultural values regarding what constitutes a threat to these ecosystems. In the present article, we propose a framework for assessing threats to dryland ecosystems and suggest we must also combat the negative perceptions of drylands in order to preserve the ecosystem services that they offer.

Linking agricultural diversification practices, soil arthropod communities and soil health	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												Soil arthropods comprise a substantial portion of soil biodiversity and regulate processes in the soil ecosystem. Despite this, cropping system diversification designed to improve soil health for agriculture is rarely evaluated for its effects on soil arthropod biodiversity and community structure. As a result, soil arthropods are not usually considered in management decisions.To address this gap, we evaluated the effects of agricultural diversification through rotation on soil arthropods and soil properties using replicated large-plot field studies representing two climatically distinct agroecological classes (AECs) in the dryland cereal-growing region of the inland Pacific Northwest, USA. We investigated how different 3-year annual crop rotations affected soil arthropod biodiversity and community structure. Treatments reflected 'business-as-usual' rotations in dryland systems and diversified rotations achieved by incorporating novel winter pea (WP) or forage crops (FORs). We also assessed relationships between the Soil Biological Quality index (QBS-ar), which uses soil arthropods as bioindicators of soil health, and other biological and physiochemical soil health indicators.We collected 710 community samples with 82,509 arthropod specimens across 66 taxa. Novel crops in diversified rotations promoted soil arthropod abundance and biodiversity relative to crops they could replace in rotation. Crop type determined community composition. Most taxa driving differences in community structure were predators and detritivores associated with WP and FORs. In addition to effects on soil arthropods associated with specific crops, effects were also detected across rotations. Incorporating WP into rotations improved QBS-ar across entire rotations, not just in the WP phases, in both AECs. Links between QBS-ar and other soil health indicators were complex and varied by AEC.Synthesis and applications: Soil arthropods respond to agricultural diversification and can be used as bioindicators to assess the effects of diversification on soil health. Below-ground arthropod communities are structured by crop type, suggesting that planting specific crops may promote soil arthropods and their services. We showed that incorporating winter pea and forage crops into dryland cereal rotations supported soil arthropod biodiversity and soil health. Results indicate that soil arthropod assessments can be included in the soil health framework to guide agricultural management decisions.

The Lefever-Lejeune nonlinear lattice: Convergence dynamics and the structure of equilibrium states	PHYSICA D-NONLINEAR PHENOMENA												We consider the Lefever-Lejeune nonlinear lattice, a spatially discrete propagation-inhibition model describing the growth of vegetation densities in dry-lands. We analytically identify parametric regimes distinguishing between decay (associated with spatial extinction of vegetation patches) and potentially non-trivial time-asymptotics. To gain insight on the convergence dynamics, a stability analysis of spatially uniform states is performed, revealing the existence of a threshold for the discretization parameter which depends on the lattice parameters, below which their destabilization occurs and spatially non-uniform equilibrium states may emerge. Direct numerical simulations justified that the analytical stability criteria and parametric thresholds effectively describe the above transition dynamics and revealed the rich structure of the equilibrium set. Connections with the continuous sibling Lefever-Lejeune partial differential equation are also discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Integrating supply and demand in ecosystem service bundles characterization across Mediterranean transformed landscapes	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												ContextHumans continually transform landscapes, affecting the ecosystem services (ES) they provide. Thus, the spatial relationships among services vary across landscapes. Managers and decision makers have access to a variety of tools for mapping landscapes and analyzing their capacity to provide multiple ES.ObjectivesThis paper characterizes and maps ES bundles across transformed landscapes in southeast Spain incorporating both the ecological and social perspectives. Our specific goals were to: (1) quantify ES biophysical supply, (2) identify public awareness, (3) map ES bundles, and (4) characterize types of ES bundles based on their social-ecological dimensions.MethodsBiophysical models and face-to-face social surveys were used to quantify and map ES bundles and explore the public awareness in a highly transformed Mediterranean region. Then, we classified ES bundles into four types using a matrix crossing the degree of biophysical ES supply and the degree of social awareness.ResultsResults mapped seven ES bundles types representing diverse social-ecological dynamics. ES bundles mapped at the municipality level showed mismatches between their biophysical provision and the public awareness, which has important implications for operationalizing the bundles concept for landscape planning and management. ES bundles characterization identified four types of bundles scenarios.ConclusionsWe propose an ES bundles classification that incorporates both their social and ecological dimensions. Our findings can be used by land managers to identify areas in which ES are declining as well as priority areas for maximizing ES provision and can help to identify conflicts associated with new management and planning practices.

Distinct assembly mechanisms underlie similar biogeographical patterns of rare and abundant bacteria in Tibetan Plateau grassland soils	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Rare biosphere represents the majority of Earth's biodiversity and performs vital ecological functions, yet little is known about its biogeographical patterns and community assembly processes in terrestrial ecosystems. Herein, we investigated the community composition and phylogeny of rare (relative abundance <0.1%) and abundant (>1%) bacteria in dryland grassland soils on the Tibetan Plateau. Results revealed similar biogeographical patterns of rare and abundant bacteria at both compositional and phylogenetic levels, but rare subcommunity was more heavily influenced by stochasticity (72%) than the abundant (57%). The compositional variation of rare bacteria was less explained by environmental factors (41%) than that of the abundant (80%), while the phylogeny of rare bacteria (36%) was more explained than that of the abundant (29%). The phylogeny of rare bacteria was equally explained by local factors (soil and vegetation) and geospatial distance (11.5% and 11.9% respectively), while that of the abundant was more explained by geospatial distance (22.1%) than local factors (11.3%). Furthermore, a substantially tighter connection between the community phylogeny and composition was observed in rare (R-2 = 0.65) than in abundant bacteria (R-2 = 0.08). Our study provides novel insights into the assembly processes and biographical patterns of rare and abundant bacteria in dryland soils.

Differences in force production and EMG activity on underwater and dry land conditions in swimmers and non-swimmers	SPORTS BIOMECHANICS												This research aims to provide a better understanding of the swimming push-off specificity comparing force production and electromyographic (EMG) activity on squat-jumps (SJ) and countermovement-jumps (CMJ) performed underwater (similar to swimming turns push-off) and dryland conditions on two different level of expertise participants (swimmers and non-swimmers). Thirteen male swimmers and nine non-trained male sport sciences students participated in this study. Each subject carried out 10 CMJ and 10 SJ jumps in dryland (vertical) and underwater (horizontal). During these trials, force production was recorded by force platforms and muscular activity of Vastus Lateralis, Biceps Femoris, Gastrocnemius Medialis and Tibialis Anterior was analysed through EMG. A three-way ANOVA showed that swimmers increased the differences in values obtained from SJ to CMJ between dry and underwater conditions during the first impulse phase-Impulse 1 (p < 0.01), the second phase of impulse-Impulse 2 (p < 0.001) and duration from peak force to take off (p < 0.001) in contrast to non-swimmers. Patterns relating to force production and EMG were non-consistent between muscles. Jumping performance was not significantly correlated between dry land and underwater conditions; nevertheless, results emphasise that environmental constraints are decisive to define the neuro-motor response to apparently similar tasks performed in different contexts.

Impact of preceding crop sequences on wheat growth and development under conservation agriculture in the eastern Free State, South Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PLANT AND SOIL												Conservation agriculture (CA) is advocated to promote sustainable cropping. Little is known about the impact of preceding crop sequences on the growth and development of dryland wheat under CA in the eastern Free State Province of South Africa. In a criss-cross experimental design, the response of wheat planted after 25 summer and 25 winter crop sequences was evaluated. Biomass yield was a more reliable indicator than grain yield as a consequence of water and nitrogen stress in the reproductive phase as indicated by harvest index, precipitation use efficiency and nitrogen agronomic efficiency. The five best sequences that favoured wheat biomass yields were, in decreasing order: grain sorghum x maize, sunflower x dry bean, sunflower x maize, soybean x soybean, and maize x maize for summer crops (7.1-7.8 t ha(-1)); and fallow x vetch, fallow x wheat, fallow x fallow, vetch x fodder oat, and wheat x oat for winter crops (6.5-7.4 t ha(-1)). Of the grading parameters, only protein content was influenced significantly by the winter crop sequences. A single 3-year cycle comprising wheat after two seasons with preceding crop sequences was insufficient to test abiotic stress factors thoroughly to establish with certainty the best crop sequences for dryland wheat production.																			0257-1862	2167-034X				JAN 1	2022	39	1					56	65		10.1080/02571862.2021.1994046	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02571862.2021.1994046		APR 2022											WOS:000800222500001

The link between water stresses and plant water status is regulated by plant hydraulics, of which the corresponding impact on plant water use and the susceptibility of Dryland ecosystems remains under-explored. We used a plant hydraulic model to describe hydraulic states and water flux of two species (Populus euphratica and Tamarix ramosissima) in desert riparian ecosystems. We optimized hydraulic parameters and tested the model using observed physiological states and ecosystem water flux. The optimized model was used to evaluate plant hydraulic sensitivity, tree mortality risk, and evapotranspiration under a wide range of water stress scenarios. The model captures the observed leaf water potential, sap-flow and ecosystem evapotranspiration. Our scenario analysis demonstrates that hydraulic sensitivities generally reduce as the water stresses intensify. The results highlight a strong coupled impact of the co-occurrence of soil and atmospheric water stresses on restricting ecosystem water flux and intensifying mortality risk. The assessment of multiple aspects of eco-physiological functions and the stress scenario analysis of desert riparian ecosystems will contribute to a better prediction of ecosystem functions and facilitate resource management under future climate.

Can topography affect the restoration of soil properties after deforestation in a semiarid ecosystem?	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The use of vegetation as a source of energy and its clearing for agricultural production has contributed to the degradation of the drylands in world. On soil, the effects of deforestation are still controversial and need to be better understood. In this study, the effect of deforestation and soil topography on soil morphological properties, nutrient availability, and carbon (C) contribution in a topossequence that was deforested 12 years before in the Brazilian semi-arid region was evaluated. For this purpose, two areas (preserved and deforested) were selected and separated into three positions along the slope: lower, middle, and upper third. For each position, the characterization of the soil fertility and the physical and morphological attributes of the selected profiles were carried out. In general, deforestation had no effect on the total organic carbon (TOC) of the soil, but, on the other hand, was responsible for increasing the structural fragility of the soil. The major effect of deforestation on soil fertility was reduced availability of cationic nutrients (Mg2+ and K+). We conclude that topography had no effect on the restoration of soil properties after deforestation in this semiarid ecosystem. For these conditions, similar management strategies (e.g. reforestation), can be adopted for the different topographical positions of the slope. Our results can be used in forest restoration projects of degraded ecosystems in drylands, to select the best practices of management, aiming at restoring the natural ecological processes of the ecosystem.

The most impacted shrub species is the Noaea mucronata (Forssk.) Asch. and Schweinf. In a four-year study, we found that herbaceous vegetation growth was greater in the dead shrub patches than in the surrounding inter-patch biocrusted spaces, suggesting that the dead shrub patches encompass improved micro-habitats. However, unexpectedly, the soil moisture in the dead shrub patches was consistently lower than that of the inter-patch biocrusted spaces. At the same time, soil quality in the dead shrub patches was higher than that in the inter-patch spaces. Therefore, it seems that the overall better soil conditions in the dead patches overcome the scarcity of soil-water, supporting increased herbaceous productivity. For explaining the discrepancy between herbaceous vegetation and soil-water, we formulated a conceptual framework, which highlights the key factors that regulate soil-water dynamics in this dryland ecosystem. We demonstrate that herbaceous vegetation is facilitated in the dead shrub patches by a legacy effect that takes place long after the shrubs have died. The dead shrub patches encompass a unique form of ecosystem engineering. The study highlights the complex and unpredicted impacts of prolonged droughts on dryland ecosystems.																			1009-637X	1861-9568				AUG	2021	31	8			SI		1187	1204		10.1007/s11442-021-1892-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11442-021-1892-2													WOS:000682661600007

We found that increases in soil organic carbon and total nitrogen associated with litter crusts was closely related to the bacterial community but not to the fungal community. Positive effects of litter crusts on soil nutrient inputs were associated with soil moisture and porosity potentially regulated by bacterial communities. Our results provide in-sights into ecological functioning of microbial communities associated with litter crusts and suggest that litter crusts enhance soil nutrient availability primarily through bacteria rather than fungi. This finding highlights the potential ecological functioning of litter crusts in governing soil nutrient dynamics.

Teixeira			Laboratory and Greenhouse Screening for Drought Tolerance Among Iranian Cumin (<i>Cuminum cyminum</i> L.) Ecotypes under Controlled Conditions	PHILIPPINE AGRICULTURAL SCIENTIST												Among different environmental stresses, drought is the abiotic factor that limits crop productivity the most. Cumin (Cuminum cyminum L.) is the second most popular spice in the world and an important medicinal plant in Iran. Drought-tolerant cumin cultivars could serve as an alternative spring sown crop in semi-arid areas. In this study, 20 local Iranian cumin ecotypes originating from Azarbaijan, Fars, Isfahan, Kerman, Semnan, Yazd, Northern, Razavi and Southern Khorasan provinces were grown under controlled (laboratory and pot) conditions at the Dryland Agricultural Research Institute (DART) of Iran. Seed germination and seedling growth were assessed under controlled conditions. Drought stress was simulated by using polyethylene glycol (PEG). Relative drought tolerance of seedlings was evaluated in a greenhouse by controlling the moisture content in pots. PEG-induced osmotic stress resulted in significant differences in germination between ecotypes. There was considerable variation in some morpho-physiological growth parameters in the greenhouse. Ecotypes from Kerman, Razavi Khorasan and Semnan provinces were more drought-tolerant than the remaining 17 ecotypes, and may be suitable for cultivation in drought-stressed areas. This data set will be useful for the development of drought-tolerant cumin cultivars.

J	Warburton, EM				Warburton, Elizabeth M.			Untapped potential: The utility of drylands for testing eco-evolutionary relationships between hosts and parasites	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE												Drylands comprise over 41% of all terrestrial surface area and are home to approximately 35.5% of the world's population; however, both free-living and parasitic fauna of these regions remain relatively understudied. Yet, the very conditions that make these regions challenging to study - extreme environmental conditions and low population density for various organisms - also make them potentially untapped natural laboratories for examining eco-evolutionary relationships between hosts and parasites. Adaptations and ecological patterns illustrated by desert parasite communities can serve as exemplars within the extremes regarding the evolution of virulence, breadth of host spectra, and lifecycle strategies. This review provides relevant examples for each of these three topics using parasites from dryland regions in order to encourage future empirical tests of hypotheses regarding parasite ecology and evolution within dryland ecosystems and stimulate wider investigation into the parasitofauna of arid regions in general. As global climate changes and anthropogenic disturbance increases, desertification is a growing problem which has been labeled as a threat to global health. Thus, deserts not only provide useful natural laboratories in which to study parasite transmission but understanding parasite transmission within these habitats becomes increasingly important as larger, likely highly resource insecure, populations are projected to live on the margins of desert regions in the future.

Endophytic bacteria are a class of biocontrol microorganisms that exist widely in plants that can, along with their metabolites, be used to develop new bacterial agents to control plant diseases and regulate plant growth while reducing the need for chemical pesticides. We previously isolated an endophytic bacterium ZJ1, Bacillus velezensis, from the stem of Buddleja lindleyana. The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from ZJ1 exhibited significant antifungal activity against Alternaria solani and Botrytis cinerea. The VOCs were identified via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of solid-phase microextraction samples (SPME-GC-MS). The results revealed eight main VOCs released by the strain ZJ1, among which isooctanol and 2-nonanol showed inhibitory effects on the mycelia growth of A. solani and B. cinerea. Furthermore, 2-nonanol and isooctanol showed good in vitro antifungal activity and in vivo control effect against the two pathogens. The 500 million CFU mL(-1) ZJ1 strain oil suspension with 200 times dilution had the highest control effect, the protective and therapeutic effects were both greater than 80%. Additionally, treatment with ZJ1 and its VOCs caused the mycelium of A. solani to become thin, twisted, deformed, bifurcated, and fractured, with a wrinkled and cracked surface. The VOCs caused leakage of the mycelia intracellular contents, thereby causing withering. Collectively, these findings suggest that the preparation of the ZJ1 strain and its VOC products, 2-nonanol and isooctanol, has good application prospects for the control of tomato early blight and grey mould.																			1125-4653	2239-7264				MAY	2022	104	2					575	589		10.1007/s42161-022-01056-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42161-022-01056-8		FEB 2022											WOS:000756351200002

Risk, perception and adaptation to climate change: evidence from arid region, India	NATURAL HAZARDS												The paper contributes to the growing literature highlighting the significance of assessing risk and vulnerability, micro-level perceptions and adaptation decision-making in building resilience of farm communities to climate change in dryland region of India. To select a region for grassroots enquiry, spatial differential in risk to climate change was assessed in Rajasthan, using IPCC AR5 framework. Among the highly vulnerable and risky districts, Bikaner district was selected for elicitation of micro-level imperatives. Rising atmospheric temperature, inter-seasonal displacements of rainfall and recurrence of extreme events were perceived by the farmers resulting in resource degradation, production risks and erosion of households' socio-economic dynamics. As risk preventive measures, suitable adjustment in agricultural practices, natural resource management, shift to off-farm activities and other relief measures were adopted by the farmers. Farmer's choice of adaptation was influenced by several climatic, socio-economic and infrastructural & institutional factors in varying degree. Moreover, several financial, economic, infrastructural and informational bottlenecks to adaptations were reported during household survey and FGDs. The results suggest that capturing grassroots evidence is crucial for directing locally tailored adaptation strategies, along with the improving deficiencies in the developmental pathways for climate-resilient agriculture.

Previous findings of high photosynthetic rates and nitrogen concentration in leaves, may contradict the known low productivity in their communities. Questions: How different are leaf ecophysiological and stoichiometric traits in dryland species? Did species favor higher water or nutrient use efficiencies in contrasting dryland communities? Studied species / data description/Mathematical model: Calliandra eriophylla, Cercidium microphyllum, Encelia farinosa, Eysenhardtia orthocarpa, Fouquieria diguetii, Fouquieria macdougalii, Ipomoea arborescens, Jatropha cardiophylla, Jatropha cordata, Larrea tridentata, Mimosa laxiflora, Olneya tesota and Prosopis velutina. Study site and dates: Sonoran Desert, Central Sonora Region, Mexico. August - September 2019. Methods: Ecophysiological and stoichiometric leaf traits were measured and analyzed for dominant species and functional types from two Sonoran Desert plant communities. Results: We found greater variability in photosynthetic and fluorescence traits than in elemental composition (N-mass, P-mass) and stoichiometry ratios. Species in the arid site tend to have higher photosynthetic rates and photochemical integration but low WUE. In the semiarid community, leaf traits were associated to higher elemental composition (N-mass, P-mass) but low stoichiometric ratios and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). Conclusions: Leaf Traits in Sonoran Desert species and functional types correlated with photoprotective mechanisms rather than instantaneous resources use efficiencies, to ensure long term C gain.

Across 106 locations, 28 years, 491 cultivars, and 49,335 dryland and 9,617 irrigated observations in South Africa, GM maize showed increased mean yields over conventional hybrid maize, and GM white maize showed higher increased yields than GM yellow maize. The majority of genetically modified (GM) crops are produced for livestock consumption, whereas minimal attention has been given to GM crops for direct human consumption. In South Africa, GM white maize has been grown for direct human consumption alongside GM yellow maize and conventional hybrid (CH) maize for livestock feed since 1999. Here we investigate yield differences between GM white, GM yellow and CH maize across 106 locations, 28 years, 491 cultivars, and 49,335 dryland and 9,617 irrigated observations in South Africa. GM maize increased mean yields over CH by 0.42 metric tons (Mt) ha(-1) and reduced yield risk. We show that GM white maize increased yields by 0.60 Mt ha(-1) and GM yellow maize by 0.27 Mt ha(-1) compared with CH maize. GM yield gains were similar for dry and irrigated production.

The drylands of China account for approximately 10.8% of global drylands, and China is the country most severely affected by aridity in Asia. Therefore, studying the spatial variation characteristics in soil multifunctionality (SMF) and investigating the driving factors are critical for elucidating and managing the functions of dryland ecosystems in China. Based on the environmental factors (mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean annual temperature (MAT), solar radiation (Srad), soil acidity (pH), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and cation exchange capacity (CEC)) and aridity from the Dataset of soil properties for land surface modeling over China, we used non-linear regression, ordinary least square (OLS) regression, structural equation model (SEM), and other analytical methods to investigate the relationships of SMF with environmental factors across different aridity levels in China. SMF in different dryland regions varied significantly and showed a patchy distribution, with SMF index values ranging from -1.21 to 2.42. Regions with SMF index values from -0.20 to 0.51 accounting for 63.0% of dryland area in China. OLS regression results revealed that environmental factors like MAP, MAT, Srad, pH, EVI, and CEC were significantly related to SMF (P < 0.05). MAP and MAT were correlated to SMF at the whole aridity level (P < 0.05). SEM results showed that the driving factors of SMF differed depending on the aridity level. Soil pH was the strongest driving factor of SMF when the aridity was less than 0.80 (P < 0.001). Both soil CEC and EVI had a positive effect on SMF when aridity was greater than 0.80 (P < 0.01), with soil CEC being the strongest driving factor. The importance ranking revealed that the relative importance contribution of soil pH to SMF was greatest when aridity was less than 0.80 (66.9%). When aridity was set to greater than 0.80, the relative importance contributions of CEC and EVI to SMF increased (45.1% and 31.9%, respectively). Our findings indicated that SMF had high spatial heterogeneity in drylands of China. The aridity threshold controlled the impact of environmental factors on SMF.																			2097-0129	2666-660X				SEP	2022	3	3					223	232		10.1016/j.regsus.2022.10.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.regsus.2022.10.001													WOS:001045082300001

Under Different Soil Fertility Conditions	JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION												Film side planting (FS) is a new water-saving and drought-resistant technology in dryland of southwest China, and nitrogen (N) is a main yield factor. However, the optimal N amount for FS rapeseed is unknown, especially in different soil fertility. Field experiments with N amounts (0, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 kg ha(-1)) for FS rapeseed arranged in four soil fertility levels (divided into < 0.5 t ha(-1), 0.5 similar to 1.0 t ha(-1), 1.0 similar to 1.5 t ha(-1), and > 1.5 t ha(-1) based on the 5-year average rapeseed yield of not fertilizing, named respectively by F1, F2, F3, and F4) were conducted to analyze N utilization and yield. Besides, relationship between yield and N amounts was also discussed. The lower the soil fertility, the higher N amounts achieving high yield. Dry matter, N accumulation, N use efficiency, N agronomic efficiency, and effective pods were greatest for 360, 300, 240, and 180 kg ha(-1) under F1, F2, F3, and F4 respectively. Eventually, 360, 300, 240, and 180 kg ha(-1) obtained 27.31 similar to 242.32%, 35.26 similar to 129.44%, 15.92 similar to 142.00%, and 15.79 similar to 109.65% significantly greater yield than other N treatments under F1 and F2 (except 360 kg N ha(-1)) and F3 and F4 (except 240 kg N ha(-1)) respectively. Based on yield-N production function, the maximum rapeseed yields were obtained for F1 at > 360 kg ha(-1) N, for F2 at > 360 kg ha(-1) N, for F3 at 312 kg ha(-1) N, and for F4 at 272 kg ha(-1) N. Therefore, the optimal N amount for FS rapeseed under low soil fertility was 360 kg ha(-1) or more and under high soil fertility was 272 similar to 312 kg ha(-1).																			0718-9508	0718-9516				MAR	2023	23	1					368	379		10.1007/s42729-022-01030-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42729-022-01030-4		FEB 2023											WOS:000936439000002

Brazil is the world's largest producer of Agave fiber (sisal). However, since the development of synthetic fibers, the national investment in Agave research has decreased drastically, leading to the cessation of the country's breeding programs. What is left of the Brazilian elite cultivars were planted at a germplasm bank in the middle of the semiarid. Surprisingly, after 7 years of abandonment, the plants were still healthy and did not show any clear signs of stress. Here, we aimed to investigate how these plants managed to cope with this environment and the molecular basis of their biomass traits. We assembled the transcriptomic atlas of Agave sisalana, Agave fourcroydes, and Agave hybrid 11648 ((A. amaniensis x A. angustifolia) x A. amaniensis). We observed that the cultivars activated a highly overlapping set of stress response genes, which were the most expressed transcripts. Also, raffinose was detected at high concentrations, possibly acting as an osmolyte, though differences at its biosynthesis have been found depending on cultivar. Finally, we observed differences in recalcitrance that could be attributed to lignin composition and its biosynthetic pathway. Our data contribute new insights that can help molecular breeders to correspond to emerging expectations for Agave as biorenewables feedstocks for dryland areas.

MATHEMATICS												Understanding ecosystem response to drier climates calls for modeling the dynamics of dryland plant populations, which are crucial determinants of ecosystem function, as they constitute the basal level of whole food webs. Two modeling approaches are widely used in population dynamics, individual (agent)-based models and continuum partial-differential-equation (PDE) models. The latter are advantageous in lending themselves to powerful methodologies of mathematical analysis, but the question of whether they are suitable to describe small discrete plant populations, as is often found in dryland ecosystems, has remained largely unaddressed. In this paper, we first draw attention to two aspects of plants that distinguish them from most other organisms-high phenotypic plasticity and dispersal of stress-tolerant seeds-and argue in favor of PDE modeling, where the state variables that describe population sizes are not discrete number densities, but rather continuous biomass densities. We then discuss a few examples that demonstrate the utility of PDE models in providing deep insights into landscape-scale behaviors, such as the onset of pattern forming instabilities, multiplicity of stable ecosystem states, regular and irregular, and the possible roles of front instabilities in reversing desertification. We briefly mention a few additional examples, and conclude by outlining the nature of the information we should and should not expect to gain from PDE model studies.

However, this critical issue is still unclear and little reported. Aging effects were evaluated in LDPE films with the thickness of 0.006, 0.008, 0.010 and 0.015 mm in a maize field of irrigation region. The Scanning electron microscope (SEM) results showed that the proportion of damaged area (Dam) to total area of LDPE films was massively lowered with increasing thickness after aging. The highest and lowest Dam was 32.2% and 3.5% in 0.006 and 0.015 mm films respectively. Also, the variations in peak intensity of asymmetric & symmetrical stretching vibrations (ASVI & SSVI) were detected using Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR), indicating that the declines in peak intensity tended to be slower with thickness. Interestingly, the declines in physical integrity were tightly associated with increasing exhalation rate of PAEs. Average releasing rate of PAEs was 38.2%, 31.4%, 31.5% and 19.7% in LDPE films from 0.006 to 0.015 mm respectively. Critically, thicker film mulching can lead to greater soil water storage at plough layer (SWS-PL) and better thermal status, accordingly harvesting higher economic benefit. Therefore, LDPE film thickening may be a solution to reduce environmental risk but improve production efficiency in arid region.

However, despite anthropogenic emissions and oceanic variability, whether Arctic amplification has a connection with land in the lower latitudes remains unknown. Here, we newly identify enhanced Asian warming as a factor underlying Arctic amplification. The simulations demonstrate that enhanced Asian warming contributes 22% of the wintertime amplified warming over the Barents-Kara Seas (BKS). We demonstrate that Asian warming remotely affects the Arctic by affecting poleward atmospheric heat and moisture transport. The external anomalous heat and moisture further trigger local feedbacks concerning sea ice-albedo feedback and changes in longwave radiation and evaporation, thus facilitating BKS warming amplification. The capacitor effect of the Arctic Ocean further modulates the seasonality of BKS warming via turbulent heat flux exchange between the atmosphere and ocean.

Sustaining cotton production under declining groundwater availability in the underlying Ogallala Aquifer and changing climate remains a key challenge for stakeholders in this region. The objectives of this study were to assess climate change impacts on cotton yield and irrigation water use, and evaluate six ideotypes for adaptation. In this study, we used the DSSAT-CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton model for simulating cotton production under 18 projected future climate scenarios and with six potential adaptation ideotypes at Bushland, Halfway and Lamesa in the northern, central, and southern parts of the THP region, respectively. Seed cotton yield and irrigation water use between baseline (1976-2005) and future periods (mid-century:2036-2065 and late-century: 2066-2095) were compared. The irrigated seed cotton yield is expected to increase by 12-21 % at cooler northern sites, and decrease by 2% at the warmer southern site, in the mid-century compared to the baseline. For the same period, seasonal irrigation water use is expected to increase by 6-11 % and dryland seed cotton yield is expected to change by +6 % to -11 % across the locations. The increases in irrigated seed cotton yield were attributed to increased vegetative growth under elevated CO2, while the decline in dryland seed cotton yield was due to poor boll retention at high growing season temperatures. Six potential climate change adaptive ideotypes with greater drought and heat tolerances, higher yield potential, and longer maturity were designed and compared to the reference cultivar. For irrigated conditions, increasing area of full leaf and enhancing partitioning of assimilates to reproductive growth (high yield potential) were preferred, because these characteristics increased seed cotton yield substantially (by 3-9 %) with a marginal change in irrigation water use (by -1 to 3 %). For dryland production, a long maturity ideotype with longer boll filling duration was the most effective ideotype with a substantial increase in seed cotton yield by 11-45 %. The results from this study will be useful to THP cotton producers and water managers in making appropriate decisions for adapting cotton production to projected changes in future climate and groundwater availability.

This study aimed at investigating the GE interaction and the stability of durum wheat (Tritium turgidum L. ssp. durum) genotypes evaluated for grain yield across different locations and years, using empirical and analytical models. The study used 19 genotypes in 14 environments, representative of rainfed durum wheat-growing areas. The genotype main effect plus GE interaction (GGE) biplot model, partial least squares regression and factorial regression models were applied for data analysis. The combined ANOVA revealed significant genotype, environment and GE interaction effects, with the environmental main effect as a main source of variation (77.9% of total variation). The mean yield of the genotypes ranged from 486 to 5594 kg/ha across environments. Using GGE biplot analysis, the test environments were classified into four groups, each with different winning genotypes. Based on mean yield and stability performance across environments, breeding lines G17 and G15 significantly out-yielded the best national check and could be recommended for release as new varieties. Rainfalls in March, June, November and May, average temperatures in June and May, heading date and 1000-kernel weight were among the explanatory covariates that significantly (P < 0.01) affected the GE interaction for grain yield.

To this end, remote sensing (RS) tools such as LULC, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized difference water index (NDWI), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data, and precipitations were processed and combined. The monitoring of LULC over this period reveals different changes in this area. Generally, for water bodies, two trends can be observed, an increasing trend since 2006 and a decreasing trend from 2011 to the present. However, an increasing trend was recorded for the urban-and-built-up-lands and the grasslands categories. NDVI, NDWI, and EVI showed three major peaks recorded in the same periods (in 2007, 2009, and 2015). In terms of water storage, three phases were found. The first depicted the lowest groundwater quantities with a decreasing trend, which corresponds to a period of drought and/or human pressure. The second phase, the most important that recorded the greatest storage of water while the third phase corresponds to low storage with a decreasing trend. LULC of croplands reveals a slightly increasing trend from 2012 to 2020, which shows an orientation to an extension of crops mainly of date palm encouraged by government programs. A strong correlation between the seasonal NDVI and water storage using GRACE-Data for the period was found. In the end, recommendations on the adaptation to CC were proposed. The findings demonstrate that RS techniques are useful tools to detect hydrological droughts, observe, and conserve land resources. In arid areas such as Errachidia, the solution lies in rationalizing the use of water resources protecting them from uncontrolled anthropogenic events, which may alleviate the pressure. To support local sustainable development, environmental scientists and decision-makers may use the outputs of this study.

Evaluation of crop water status of melon plants in tropical semi-arid climate using thermal imaging	REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL												The objective of this study was to analyze the feasibility of using thermal images to estimate the water status of melon plants (Cucumis melo L.) in tropical semi-arid climates. The study was conducted in a randomized block design with a split-plot arrangement. The plots comprised of soil cover (with and without mulching), and subplots were constructed using five irrigation regimes (120, 100, 80, 60, and 40% crop evapotranspiration), with five replicates. The following variables were evaluated: canopy temperature (Tcanopy), leaf water potential, air temperature (Tair), soil moisture, crop yield, and thermal index (Delta T), which is defined as the difference between Tcanopy and Tair. Delta T exhibited high correlations with crop yield and water consumption, indicating that thermography is an efficient tool for identifying the water status of melon plants, which could be employed for proper irrigation scheduling under tropical semi-arid scenarios. Moreover, thermal images identified the beneficial effects of soil cover on leaf water status and crop yield, primarily under moderate deficit irrigation. These results demonstrate that mulching is essential for increasing melon yield and water productivity in tropical regions.

Contributions of hypolithic communities to surface soil organic carbon across a hyperarid-to-arid climate gradient	GEODERMA												Carbon (C) in soils accounts for a substantial and dynamic portion of the global C cycle, with concentrations of soil organic carbon (SOC) typically closely linked to vascular plant productivity. However, C fixed by non-vascular photosynthetic organisms may account for a sizeable proportion of SOC in locations where vascular plants are not abundant. In the hyperarid Namib Desert, vascular plant growth is very limited and largely ephemeral. Extreme abiotic conditions even limit establishment of cyanobacterial soil crusts, with photoauto-trophic cyanobacteria largely restricted to the undersides of translucent quartz clasts that buffer environmental extremes. The importance of these 'hypoliths' in enhancing SOC pools, and how this may vary with climate and clast physical characteristics, remains unknown. We worked across a rainfall and fog gradient in the central Namib to assess quartz clast size and distribution, factors affecting the probability of hypolithic colonization, and the landscape-level influence of hypoliths on surface SOC pools. Clast colonization increased with clast thickness and with increasing mean annual rainfall. SOC and chlorophyll a (a proxy for cyanobacterial biomass) con-centrations were greater under colonized quartz clasts than under non-quartz clasts or in bare soil. Landscape-level SOC, estimated by combining SOC concentration with the distribution and colonization of quartz clasts, was greatest at the site with the highest rainfall and lowest at a mid-gradient site with moderate rainfall and fog. Climate change scenarios that promote quartz colonization have the potential to double SOC pools at the mid-gradient site, although SOC changes would be more muted at other sites. Low vascular plant and biocrust cover in the Namib Desert allows hypolithic communities to play an outsized role in SOC pools; a loss of all hypolithic cyanobacteria would lead to 10-20% declines in surface SOC pools. Future climate change has the potential to shift surface SOC if it alters cyanobacterial colonization of quartz.

Socio-Economic Constraints of Adopting New Cowpea Varieties in Three Agro-Ecological Zones in the Senegalese Peanut Basin	SUSTAINABILITY												Socio-economic constraints like gender, education, age, and income significantly affect the adoption of improved agricultural technologies. The objective of this study was to determine socio-economic factors that affect the adoption of improved cowpea varieties in the Senegalese peanut basin. The study was conducted in three (Bambey, Kebemer, and Kaffrine) of six regions of the peanut basin based on regional importance of cowpea production and rainfall gradient. In each study region, ten villages were selected, and random sampling was used to select eight heads of agricultural households within each village. The questionnaires were administered to 240 randomly selected farmers across the three study regions, 7 communes, and 30 villages. Results showed most heads of households were middle-aged (52-54 years old), married (95-100%), illiterate (84%), and men (95-100%). Households were mostly agriculture dependent (87%), low literacy rates (26% least primary school), and large family sizes (average of 15 members). The median cowpea yields across the study area varied from 35-100 kg ha(-1), well below the similar to 300-400 kg ha(-1) average yields reported for Senegal and Sub-Saharan Africa. The majority of farmers (67%) in the study regions did not use improved varieties, and the main reasons were low seed availability (78.8%) and limited access to technical knowledge and information (76.3%), but only 5.8% indicated seed price as a barrier to improved variety adoption. Major uses of cowpea in the study area were for marketing, livestock feed, and human consumption. In Kaffrine, fodder production was the major (85%) criterion for cowpea variety selection, whereas in the north (Bambey and Kebemer), taste, maturity date, and grain yield were major selection criteria. Factors that had positive effect on the likelihood of using improved cowpea varieties include; access to extension services, membership in farmers' organization, cowpea being the main crop of production, organic farming, market, and livestock-oriented production systems, access to farmland and credit, dependence on agriculture as the main source of household income, and education of head of household. We conclude that there is a critical need for training, access to improved seeds, awareness, and financial support to producers to increase the adoption of new improved cowpea varieties, yields, profitability, and nutritional security among smallholder farmers in the Senegalese peanut basin.

A 2-year study investigated the effects of varietal differences and companion legume species on forage dry matter (DM) production, nutritive value, and plant secondary composition of two chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) cultivars (Antler and Grasslands Puna) grown in monoculture and in binary mixtures with red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) or birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.). Antler chicory out-yielded Grasslands Puna chicory in the 2017/2018 growing season but the superiority of Antler was not consistent in 2018/2019. Binary mixtures of chicory and red clover consistently provided greater DM yield and higher nutritive quality forage than chicory monocultures. Intercropping birdsfoot trefoil with chicory cultivar Grasslands Puna yielded more DM in 2018/2019 and had lower NDF content in summer compared to chicory monocultures, but not when intercropped with Antler. Intercropping led to increased condensed tannin (CT) concentrations in forages as compared to monocultures. Antler chicory contained 7.3 times more (CT) compared to Grasslands Puna, but there was no significant difference in their anthocyanin concentrations.

In many example systems, such as models of desertification fronts in dryland ecosystems, such fronts can exhibit an instability by which the interface destabilizes into fingering patterns. Motivated by the appearance of such patterns, we propose two versions of a 2D stability criterion for (transversal) long wavelength perturbations along the interface of these traveling slow- fast-slow fronts. The fronts are constructed using geometric singular perturbation techniques by connecting slow orbits on two distinct normally hyperbolic slow manifolds through a heteroclinic orbit in the fast problem. The associated stability criteria are expressed in terms of the nonlinearities of the system and the slow-fast-slow structure of the fronts. We illustrate and further elaborate on the general set-up by explicitly working out the existence and transversal (in)stability of traveling fronts in a number of example systems/models. We analytically establish the instability of invading bare soil/vegetation interfaces against transversal long wavelength perturbations in several dryland ecosystem models and numerically recover fingering vegetation patterns counter-invading an invading desertification front.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

Moench] serves as a low-cost alternative to corn (Zea mays L.) in semi-arid regions of the world because of its high N and water use efficiencies. However, there has been a concern regarding N loss to the atmosphere as nitrous oxide (N2O) from semi-arid drylands. This study investigated various soil C and N components, including CO2 and N2O emissions, and crop yield with a dairy compost (13.5 Mg ha(-1)) and four rates of chemical N fertilizer (0, 22.4, 44.8, and 67.3 kg ha(-1)) in dryland sorghum. There was no significant difference in soil C and N fractions among N fertilizer rates, although compost addition numerically increased soil C storage and 67.3 kg ha(-1) N rate resulted the highest yield in both years. Potential nitrogen mineralization (PNM) was negatively related to crop yield and positively related to grain N content. Soils with greater inorganic N and PNM had a lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, while soils with greater potential C mineralization (PCM) had lower N2O emissions. The results of this study show no significant improvements in yield of dryland sorghum in the semi-arid environment of southern Great Plains in the short term. However, compost and 44.8 kg N ha(-1) applications appeared to be beneficial when both yield and quality were compared.

Relating soil physical properties to other soil properties and crop yields	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Soil physical properties can be related to other soil properties and crop yields, but their evaluations as soil health indicators relating to extensive soil properties and long-term crop yields need further exploration. We evaluated the long-term (14 and 36 year) effect of cropping systems and N fertilizations on selected soil physical properties and related them to 66 soil physical, chemical, biological, and biochemical properties and mean crop yields across years at two dryland farming sites in the semiarid region of the northern Great Plains, USA. Treatments were rotations of no-tillage and conventional tillage spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), pea (Pisum sativum L.), and fallow with or without N fertilization. Soil samples collected in April 2019 were analyzed for physical, chemical, biological, and biochemical properties and mean crop yields were determined. The average slake aggregate (ASA), wet aggregate stability index (WASI), and intact core available water holding capacity (IAWHC) were associated with most soil physical, chemical, biological, and biochemical properties and clay concentration was associated with nutrient concentrations. These parameters were also better related to mean crop yields across years than other soil physical properties. Because of the enhanced relationship with soil properties and crop yields and simple and inexpensive measurement, ASA can be used as a potential soil health indicator in dryland cropping systems in semiarid regions.																			2045-2322					DEC 20	2022	12	1							22025	10.1038/s41598-022-26619-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-26619-8								36539542					WOS:000969800000067
J	Huang, H; Yu, KL; Fan, Y; D'Odorico, P				Huang, Heng; Yu, Kailiang; Fan, Ying; D'Odorico, Paolo			The competitive advantage of C4 grasses over CAM plants under increased rainfall variability	PLANT AND SOIL												Background and aims The intensity of extreme rainfall events is increasing in many regions of the world, with important impacts on community dynamics and ecosystem functioning especially in water-limited ecosystems. The impact of the intensification of extreme precipitation on mixed communities of CAM plants and dryland C4 grasses remains poorly understood. Methods Through a set of greenhouse experiments we investigated the effect of increasing intraseasonal rainfall variability on two separate pairs of CAM and C4 grass species (C. imbricata and B. eriopoda; O. phaeacantha and B. curtipendula) that coexist in arid grasslands across the southwest USA. Results The increased rainfall variability did not significantly change the biomass of C. imbricata while increasing the biomass of B. eriopoda when these two species coexisted. More extreme rainfall regimes caused a 24.8% decrease in B. curtipendula (grass) biomass, compared with a 71.3% decline in the O. phaeacantha CAM plant. Significantly lower nocturnal carbon assimilation rates and higher stem volume-to-surface area ratios were found in CAM plants in mixture than in monoculture. Conclusions Our study suggests that C4 grasses may outcompete CAM plants through greater access to deep soil water under increased rainfall variability and highlights the important role of hydrologic conditions as determinants of the competitive relations between CAM plants and grasses, their community composition, and ecological resilience in dryland ecosystems.

However, how the multifaceted characteristics of aridity, particularly atmospheric, hydrological, and ecological drying, change and interact with each other are largely unknown. A gap we bridged was discovering the causal relationships underlying the atmosphere-hydrosphere-biosphere nexus from the nonlinear dynamic system perspective based on convergent cross mapping (CCM). Dryland area in China has expanded since 1982, while the vegetation greenness indicated by leaf area index has been increasing during the same period. The results showed that the causality among atmospheric, hydrological, and ecological drying in different subtypes of drylands was different. In arid and semi-arid regions: vegetation changes were mainly driven by soil moisture (SM) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and VPD regulated SM. In hyper-arid and dry sub-humid areas: VPD dominated vegetation changes. VPD increases did not contribute to SM loss under the intense water stress in hyper-arid regions, as the soil water supply cannot meet the atmospheric water demand. In dry sub-humid areas, human disturbances have attenuated the dependence of vegetation changes on SM variability. This research pioneers complex nonlinear dynamic analyses on the multifaceted characteristics of ecosystems, which can deepen our understanding of atmosphere-vegetation-soil interactions in drylands and guide the sustainable management of dryland ecosystems in China and elsewhere.

Furrow diking, a method involving compartmentalizing micro-basins to increase infiltration and soil water storage is one of the most promising water conservation solutions, particularly for sloping terrain. Moreover, furrow diking is associated with water conservation practices and regenerative agriculture as adaptive to dryland crop production. The present research study aims at improving the process of building soil compartmentalized segments using furrow diking technology, by designing and testing optimal geometries for the active soil modeling component. Three new constructive designs of a furrow diking active subassembly were built and tested in comparison with the standard version. In accordance with the considered quality indicators, the most efficient constructive shape was the curved rotor blade due to the higher volume of managed soil and fewer soil losses. Furthermore, the technology applied on three non-irrigated sunflower experimental crops grown on sloping land showed very good effectiveness with respect to the studied climatic and pedological conditions in southern Romania. When compared with non-compartmentalized crops, the most efficient rotor geometry design increased seed production by 11-13%. Water storage efficiency contributed the most to the yield increase, with moisture retention from the root zone improving by an average of 20%.

Registration of 'GemCraft' spring malting barley cultivar	JOURNAL OF PLANT REGISTRATIONS												'GemCraft' (Reg. no CV-379, PI 701910), is a two-rowed spring malt barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) developed by the USDA-ARS, Aberdeen, ID, in cooperation with the University of Idaho Agricultural Experiment Station, in 2023. The release is derived from the cross of 2B98-5312/98Ab11993 and was advanced through the bulk pedigree method F1-F5. GemCraft has been tested at the USDA-ARS, and all other cooperative trials, as line 2Ab08-X05M010-65. This cultivar has been tested across 32 location years under irrigated conditions and 13 location years in dryland conditions. GemCraft has shown similar yield to the current malting barley cultivar checks Voyager, Merit 57, M69, Conrad, and AC Metcalfe but has higher yield potential than 'CDC Copeland', M69, and 'Harrington' under irrigated conditions. In dryland trials, GemCraft has similar yield to the checks of Voyager and Conrad but higher yield than other checks. Malting quality evaluation results showed GemCraft has high extract, low protein, and competent values in other traits. All the evaluations suggested that GemCraft would be a good choice as a malting cultivar for craft brewers. The cultivar is a two-rowed spring malting barley.This cultivar is specifically developed for the craft brewing industry.The cultivar has great yield potential.Laboratory testing confirmed the good malting quality.Brewers Association tested the cultivar and concluded the satisfactory flavor to the craft brewers.																			1936-5209	1940-3496				2023 OCT 26	2023										10.1002/plr2.20331	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/plr2.20331		OCT 2023											WOS:001087349000001

Recent trends in soil fertility across the farms of East Gippsland	SOIL RESEARCH												Current data are needed to manage our soil resources but there are few recent purpose-built surveys of soil fertility, a critical asset for natural resources management. Instead, data collected for other purposes are re-used as has been the case in our area of interest here: managing the threat of soil erosion on farm land in East Gippsland. The dynamic nature of soil fertility challenges this approach, so we conducted a new survey using 234 paddocks selected at random. These new data were compared to re-purposed legacy data. Plant tissue samples from a selected subset were used to assess micronutrients. Separately, 27 paddocks that had been sampled during 1975-89 were re-tested to examine temporal changes. We concluded that many paddocks are now strongly or very strongly acidic and deficient in molybdenum (Mo) and boron (B). More specifically, those under dairying, cropping and horticulture are likely to have adequate phosphorus (P) while those grazed for meat and wool are likely to be deficient in P. We concluded that grazing enterprises need to either re-adopt soil testing and fertiliser treatment or adopt management practices suitable for acid soils deficient in P, Mo and B, if their paddocks are to support sustainable productive agriculture. Data from the re-tested paddocks suggest that, in general, many were once less acidic, highlighting the difficulties in using legacy data. Also, contrasts in soil pH and available P between paddocks under different management regimes, highlighted the difficulties in using re-purposed data. We concluded that a statistically designed survey is a preferable basis for natural resource management.

Most attention has focused on perennial meandering rivers with well developed riparian vegetation assemblages, and while increasing interest is turning towards the dynamics and sedimentology of ephemeral meandering rivers with sparse to no vegetation, additional field data are required. As a contribution, this study presents a remote-sensing and field-based analysis of chute cutoff-driven abandonment and sedimentation of meander bends along the fine-grained, non-vegetated, ephemeral Rio Colorado on the Bolivia Altiplano. Along the 25 km long sinuous study reach, located between 25 and 50 km upstream of the present-day margins of Salar de Uyuni, quasi-regular flood events (typically at least one per year) drive bend cutoffs and wider channel-floodplain dynamics, despite low specific stream power (<10 W/m(2)) and cohesive (dominantly silt and clay) bed and bank sediments. Along the reach, twenty-two cutoffs are evident, with chute cutoff the dominant mechanism. Three chute cutoffs (CC1, CC2, CC3) occurred between 1996 and 2016; for one bend (CC3), high-resolution (<0.65m) satellite imagery and field investigations reveal the details of pre-, mid- and post-chute cutoff processes and sedimentary products. Together, the findings suggest that for any given bend, an increase in bend amplitude (mean ratio of meander bend length to chute channel length similar to 4) combines with a typically high diversion angle between the channel-belt axis and the upstream limb of the meander bend (mean similar to 98 degrees) to result in declining flow efficiencies. This enhances overbank flooding and promotes deposition along the upstream limb of the bend. Overbank flooding promotes the development of chute channels, which commonly initiate as shallow (typically <1 m) headward eroding channels, while sediment derived from overbank flow and headward erosion tends to be deposited in the downstream limb of the bend. By obstructing flow, such deposition reduces sediment transport capacity within the meander bend as a whole, thereby further inducing deposition within the upstream limb. During subsequent floods, deepening and widening of a dominant chute channel and sedimentation and shallowing of the meander bend continues. Along the reach, episodic La Nina-driven flood events drive phases of more rapid bend migration and clusters of chute cutoffs. Our findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of meandering river dynamics across the full range of Earth's conditions, and also may help to improve interpretations of Earth's pre-vegetation rivers and meandering fluvial forms on other planetary bodies.

M.; Li, Feng-Min			Integrated model and field experiment to determine the optimum planting density in plastic film mulched rainfed agriculture	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Ridge-furrow mulching with plastic film is widespread in northern China because it can significantly improve crop yields. Whether maize grain yield would further increase with higher plant density, due to the better soil moisture conditions under plastic mulch, is unknown. A process-based model (DeNitrification-DeComposition) coupled with a field experiment during the 2014-2015 growing seasons was used to evaluate the effect of plant density on yield. The field experiment included three treatment groups: soil fully covered with transparent polyethylene film (PM) with plant densities 35,000 (PM35), 45,000 (PM45), and 65,000 plants ha(-1) (PM65) and bare soil with a maize planting density of 45,000 plants ha(-1) as the control (CK). The DNDC simulated yield in PM and CK was well-matched with the measured values and maize growth pattern, and explained 64% of the yield variation and had an RMSE of 176 kg ha(-1). At the same planting density (45,000 plants ha(-1)), individual plant weight, grain weight per plant, 100-seed weight, and grain yield in the non-mulched plots were 45, 28, 52, and 28% of the values for mulched plots, respectively. In the mulched plots, the individual plant size, grain weight, and seed size significantly decreased as planting density increased. The PM65 had 8% and 19% higher grain yield than PM(45 )and PM35 , respectively. Increasing planting density above 45,000 plant ha(-1) in the PM resulted in a small but non-significant increase in grain yield. We concluded that increasing plant density in PM will not necessarily increase maize yield, and the optimum planting density could be determined by combining the field experiment with the model.

A large phenotypic diversity based on agro-physiological traits was detected. Based on genotype-by-trait (GT) biplot analysis, several trends in germplasm adaptation to drought conditions were identified. The majority of ICARDA germplasms that were most favored by grain yield, 1000-kernel weight (TKW), normal difference vegetative index (NDVI), plant height (PH), and peduncle length (PL) were clearly separated from most CIMMYT germplasms that most characterized late in heading (DH) and maturity (DM) and higher canopy temperature (CT). These findings indicate that the breeding lines originally developed from ICARDA may possess tolerance traits to drought conditions that are absent in those developed in CIMMYT. The start codon targeted (SCoT) was applied for genetic relationship analysis of 220 breeding lines. The percent of polymorphism ranged from 50% (SCoT25) to 100% (SCoT2) with an average of 72.22%. The SCoT-based cluster analysis identified five different groups corresponding to the genomic constitution in durum germplasm, which was in part confirmed by principal coordinate analysis. Grouping of germplasms using multivariate clustering methods allowed identification of breeding lines with outstanding characteristics under rainfed conditions. Some clear trends in adaptation of germplasms to rainfed conditions based on phenotypic data were observed, which were mostly dependent on geographical difference of germplasms.

To understand these patterns, stable isotope analyses (delta H-2 and delta O-18) and hydrochemical methods were employed to study the recharge and evolution of groundwater. MixSIAR Bayesian mixture modelling and statistical regression techniques were utilized to investigate the influence of land-use type on groundwater recharge and to calculate the contribution of various water sources to different groundwater types. These findings are important for effective management and conservation of groundwater resources. The groundwater in all studied areas displayed a magnesium bicarbonate type with notable cation exchange, and also demonstrated the dissolution of carbonate and weathering of silicate. Results from the Bayesian mixture model indicate that 69.3% of the groundwater in the Loess Plateau region was recharged by precipitation, while 86.9% of the groundwater in the loess hilly-gully region was recharged from the surface water. Groundwater recharge was more rapid in the loess hilly-gully region than in the Loess Plateau and was less sensitive to the land use type in the former. Dryland-moderate coverage grassland was found to be most conducive to groundwater infiltration, whereas monotypic dryland and high-coverage grassland inhibited infiltration to some degree. To maintain balanced soil erosion control, an increase the area of moderate-coverage grasslands in the Loess Plateau region is recommended.

However, compared to vascular plants, the responses of biocrusts and their coexistence with vascular plants to global change remain elusive. We conducted a 5-year experiment involving multi-level precipitation and nitrogen addition in a desert shrubland of northern China to examine these responses. We found that shrubs, perennial herbs and annuals exhibited facilitative, competitive and insignificant effects on biocrusts respectively. Biocrusts coexisted with vascular plants below a threshold of herbaceous productivity of approximately 70 g/m(2) and tended to be replaced by herbs beyond this threshold, resulting from the balance between the shade tolerance of biocrusts and herb-induced light limitation. Increased precipitation and nitrogen enrichment altered biocrust-vascular plant composition by influencing this balance and tended to shift from a biocrust-dominated to a vascular plant-dominated state when the threshold was crossed. Synthesis. Our results suggest that biocrusts can coexist with dwarf shrubs and annuals, but cannot withstand perennial herbs when the herbaceous productivity threshold was exceeded. Our findings provide new insights into the threshold and mechanisms of biocrust-vascular plant coexistence, which may greatly contribute to managing dryland ecosystems for global change.					bai, yuxuan/HRB-7170-2023; She, Weiwei/P-4164-2015; Bai, Yuxuan/ABB-6460-2020	She, Weiwei/0000-0002-0911-9169; Zhang, Yuqing/0000-0003-2802-9641; Chen, Ning/0000-0002-1779-915X; Qiao, Yangui/0000-0002-7940-0255													0022-0477	1365-2745				APR	2022	110	4					772	783		10.1111/1365-2745.13834	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.13834		JAN 2022											WOS:000739484100001

Taxonomical studies have classified Ae. tauschii into two subspecies, ssp. tauschii and ssp. strangulata. However, molecular analysis revealed three distantly related lineages, TauL1, TauL2 and TauL3. TauL1 and TauL3 includes the only ssp. tauschii, whereas TauL2 includes both subspecies. This study aimed to clarify the phylogeny of Ae. tauschii and to find the traits that can differentiate between TauL1, TauL2 and TauL3, or between ssp. tauschii and ssp. strangulata. We studied the genetic and morpho-physiological diversity in 293 accessions of Ae. tauschii, covering the entire range of the species. A total of 5880 high-quality SNPs derived from DArTseq were used for phylogenetic cluster analyses. As a result, we observed wide morpho-physiological variation in each lineage and subspecies. Despite this variation, no key traits can discriminate lineages or subspecies though some traits were significantly different. Of 124 accessions previously lacking the passport data, 66 were allocated to TauL1, 57 to TauL2, and one to TauL3.

Soil-litter mixing promotes decomposition and soil aggregate formation on contrasting geomorphic surfaces in a shrub-invaded Sonoran Desert grassland	PLANT AND SOIL												Aims Shrub encroachment into grasslands alters organic carbon pools and patterns of decomposition. Here, we quantify the influence of plant life-form patches occuring on contrasting geomorphic substrates on (1) soil-litter mixing (SLM) and litter decomposition and 2) the development of soil aggregates and soil-microbial films on litter. Methods A factorial experiment in a shrub-invaded arid grassland tested the hypotheses that SLM would promote decomposition, and that development of soil films and aggregates would be inversely related to grass cover and positively related to soil surface clay content. Litterbags containing shrub (Prosopis velutina) leaf litter were deployed on a sandy Holocene-age soil and on a clayey Pleistocene-age soil under and away from shrubs on areas with low and high grass cover. Results SLM accelerated decomposition, with highest rates on sandy soils in inter-shrub areas with low grass cover. Decomposition on clayey soils was slower, despite more rapid development of soil films. Soil-microbial film formation in bare ground placements exceeded that in shrub or grass placements and was greater on sandy Holocene-age soils compared to clayey Pleistocene-age soils. Conclusions Vegetation structure and geomorphology should be considered when modeling decomposition dynamics in systems with low plant cover and high rates of aeolian and fluvial soil movement.

Hochst trees to longhorn beetle damage	HELIYON												Frankincense is an important tree resin that provides a livelihood in the semi-arid lower highlands of East Africa. In the absence of sustainable management strategies, Boswellia papyrifera trees were being overexploited, leading to a depletion of genetic diversity, affected by pests and diseases, failure in natural regeneration, and hence a subsequent decline in socio-ecological benefits obtained from the species. We studied the impact of (i) continuous resin tapping without resting years and (ii) tapping or wonding intensity for frankincence production on the prevalence of longhorn beetle (Idactus spinipennis Gahan, Cerambycidae (sub family Lamiinae) damage in northern Ethiopia. We found that continuous resin tapping for frankincense harvest without adequate resting period made trees more vulnerable to longhorn beetle damage (P < 0.05). Trees rested for 10 and more years from resin tapping had less beetle damage occurrence than those tapped continuously (P < 0.05). Stem tapping intensity of more than 12 wounds per tree in one frankincense harvesting season caused high longhorn beetle damage incidence in Central Tigray (up to 90%) and Western Tigray (up to 80%). We recommend that B. papyrifera trees should have a resting period of at least 3 years and more after one year of continuous tapping. Depending on the size of a tree, wounding for frankincense harvest should be restricted to less than 12 wounds per tree. These measures would help the species develop resistance to longhorn beetle attack and maintain a healthy population for sustainable provision of ecosystem services including frankincense production in the dryalnds of northern Ethiopia.

Relative quantification of wind erosion in argan woodlands in Souss Basin, Morocco	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Endemic argan woodlands cover large parts of south Morocco and create a characteristic landscape with areas of sparsely vegetated and bare soil surfaces between single trees. This unique ecosystem has been under extensive agrosilvopastoral management for centuries and is now at risk of degradation caused by overgrazing and increasing scarcity and variability of rainfall. To investigate susceptibility to wind erosion, we conducted an experimental-empirical study including wind tunnel tests and a drone-generated digital elevation model and quantified wind-erodible material on five different associated surface types by means of sediment catchers. The highest emission flux was measured on freshly ploughed surfaces (1875 g m(-2) h(-1)), while older ploughed areas with a re-established crust produced a much lower emission flux (795 g m(-2) h(-1)). Extensive tillage may have been a sustainable practice for generations, but increasing drought and uncertainty of rainfall now lead to an acute risk of severe soil erosion and dust production. The typical crusted surfaces characterized by residual rock fragment accumulation and wash processes produced the second highest emission flux (1,354 g m(-2) h(-1)). Material collected from tree-shaded areas (933 g m(-2) h(-1)) was revealed to be a considerable source of organic material, possibly affecting substrate conditions positively on a larger regional scale. The lowest flux was measured on rock fragment-covered surfaces (301 g m(-2) h(-1)). The data show that open argan woodland may be a considerable source for wind erosion and dust production, depending on surface characteristics strongly related to management.

This improvement is partially attributable to changes in the soil bacteria. In this study, we explored the bacterial factors involved in soil nutrients improvement under conservation tillage based on an 8-year in situ field trial. Two conservation tillage methods, no tillage (NT) and subsoiling tillage (ST) were used, and a moldboard plow (CT) was used as a control. The results indicated that compared to the CT, NT and ST significantly increased ACE indices by 12.4% and 10.5%, Shannon indices by 22.8% and 18.8%, respectively and this increase was positively correlated with the soil organic matter (SOM), available nitrogen (AN) and available phosphorus (AP) contents. In addition, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes and Nitrospirae were more abundant in the NT (20.8%, 5.2%, 7.04%) and ST (22.9%, 9.9%, 7.1%), while Planctomycetes was lower in the NT (-22.8%) and ST (-19.9%) compared to CT. Further analyses showed that the increase in the abundance of Acidobacteria was positively correlated with SOM, AP and AN. Overall, conservation tillage increased bacterial diversity and abundance and tested beneficial for soil nutrient improvement and the increased abundance of Acidobacteria might play an important role in soil nutrient improvement.					wang, zhenhui/JMQ-0550-2023; Li, Zilong/JEZ-8642-2023; Chen, Shuo/JEO-6350-2023; Wang, Xuezhen/IUN-6267-2023; Li, June/JEF-1173-2023; wang, xiao/HZI-9156-2023; hao, wang/IXN-0703-2023	hao, wang/0000-0002-5109-7194													0365-0340	1476-3567				SEP 18	2020	66	11					1509	1519		10.1080/03650340.2019.1677892	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2019.1677892													WOS:000564311300004

To date, it has been unclear whether such low yields were due to rice paddies altering soil physical or mineral characteristics, or both. To investigate this quandary, we conducted field experiments in the Jianghan Plain to analyze differences in the spatial distribution of wheat roots between rice-wheat rotation (RW) and dryland-wheat rotations (DW) using a range of nitrogen treatments. Dryland wheat crops were preceded by either dryland soybean or corn in the prior summer. Biomass of wheat crops in RW systems was significantly lower than that of DW for all N fertilizer treatments, although optimal nitrogen management resulted in comparable wheat yields in both DW and RW. Soil saturated water capacity and non-capillary porosity were higher in DW than RW, whereas soil bulk density was higher in RW. Soil available nitrogen and organic matter were higher in DW than RW irrespective of N application, while soil available P and K were higher under RW both at anthesis and post-harvest stages. At anthesis, root length percentage (RLP) was more concentrated in surface layers (0-20 cm) in RW, whereas at 20-40 cm and 40-60 cm, RLP was higher in DW than RW for all N treatments. At maturity, RLP were ranked 0-20 > 20-40 > 40-60 cm under both cropping systems irrespective of N fertilization. Root length percentage and soil chemical properties at 0-20 cm were positively correlated (r = 0.79 at anthesis, r = 0.68 at post-harvest) with soil available P, while available N (r = -0.59) and soil organic matter (r = -0.39) were negatively correlated with RLP at anthesis. Nitrogen applied at 180 kg ha(-1) in three unform amounts of 60 kg N ha(-1) at sowing, wintering and jointing resulted in higher yields than other treatments for both cropping systems. Overall, our results suggest that flooding of rice paddies increased bulk density and reduced available nitrogen, inhibiting the growth and yield of subsequent wheat crops relative to rainfed corn or soybean crops.

However, traits from species of wild Oryza have already been used to improve tolerance to abiotic stress in cultivated rice. This study aimed to establish root responses to sudden soil flooding among eight wild relatives of rice with different habitat preferences benchmarked against three genotypes of O. sativa. Plants were raised hydroponically, mimicking drained or flooded soils, to assess the plasticity of adventitious roots. Traits included were apparent permeance (P-A) to O-2 of the outer part of the roots, radial water loss, tissue porosity, apoplastic barriers in the exodermis, and root anatomical traits. These were analysed using a plasticity index and hierarchical clustering based on principal component analysis. For example, O. brachyantha, a wetland species, possessed very low tissue porosity compared with other wetland species, whereas dryland species O. latifolia and O. granulata exhibited significantly lower plasticity compared with wetland species and clustered in their own group. Most species clustered according to growing conditions based on P-A, radial water loss, root porosity, and key anatomical traits, indicating strong anatomical and physiological responses to sudden soil flooding. Soil flooding resulted in strong acclimation in key root traits for three cultivars and six wild species of rice, while two dryland species showed little plasticity in root traits.

Here, four machine learning (ML) algorithms including artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (KNNs), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) are employed and evaluated for gap-filling CO2 fluxes over a semiarid sagebrush ecosystem with different lengths of artificial gaps. The ANN and RF algorithms outperform the KNN and SVM in filling gaps ranging from hours to days, with the RF being more time efficient than the ANN. Performances of the ANN and RF are largely degraded for extremely long gaps of 2 months. In addition, our results suggest that there is no need to fill the daytime and nighttime net ecosystem exchange (NEE) gaps separately when using the ANN and RF. With the ANN and RF, the gap-filling-induced uncertainties in the annual NEE at this site are estimated to be within 16 gCm (-2), whereas the uncertainties by the KNN and SVM can be as large as 27 gCm 2. To better fill extremely long gaps of a few months, we test a two-layer gap-filling framework based on the RF. With this framework, the model performance is improved significantly, especially for the nighttime data. Therefore, this approach provides an alternative in filling extremely long gaps to characterize annual carbon budgets and interannual variability in dryland ecosystems.

Modeling the emergence of North African knapweed (<i>Centaurea diluta</i>), an increasingly troublesome weed in Spain	WEED SCIENCE												North African knapweed (Centaurea diluta Aiton) is an annual weed that is widespread in southern Spain and is of increasing concern in dryland cropping systems. Despite its expanding range in Spain, there is limited information on the emergence timing and pattern of this species, knowledge of which is critical for developing more timely and effective management strategies. Therefore, there is a need to develop simple and reliable models to predict the timing and emergence of this annual weed under dryland conditions. A multi-location field experiment was established across Spain in 2016 to 2017 to assess the emergence of C. diluta. At each of 11 locations, seeds were sown in the fall, and emergence was recorded. Overall emergence averaged 39% in the first year across all sites and 11% in the second year. In both years, the main emergence flush occurred at the beginning of the growing season. A three-parameter Weibull function best described seedling emergence of C. diluta. Emergence models were developed based on thermal time (TT) and hydrothermal time (HTT) and showed high predictability, as evidenced by root mean-square error prediction values of 10.8 and 10.7, respectively. Three cardinal points were established for TT and HHT at 0.5, 10, and 35 C for base, optimal, and ceiling temperatures, respectively, while base water potential was estimated at -0.5 MPa.

This study takes Guangxi as the research object and compares multiple intelligent classification algorithms for land cover based on multi-source data. Selects Random Forest (RF) classification algorithms for land cover classification, analyses their temporal and spatial changes, and the extracted results produce SDG 15.1.1, 15.1.2, 15.1.4 indicators, and assess the degree of completion of Guangxi's SDGs 15.2 indicators. On this basis, the equivalent factor method was used to evaluate the change of ecosystem value caused by land use change, and the direct impact of land use change on SDG15.9 was evaluated. The results indicate that:(1) From 1990 to 2020, forest was the most important land use mode in Guangxi, and the most serious wetland shrinkage was in Beihai and Nanning; The overall trend of land use changes is that wetlands, forests, and grasslands have decreased, dry land and construction land have increased, and bare land has remained basically remained unchanged. (2) From 1990 to 2020, the SDG 15.1.1 indicator showed a slow rise and then a rapid decline. The SDG 15.1.2 indicator showed a continuous downward trend. The SDG 15.1.4 indicator showed a steady upward trend. Guangxi failed to achieve the target of SDG15.2 by 2020. (3) From 1990 to 2020, the overall ecosystem service value in Guangxi showed a decreasing trend, and the one-way ecosystem service value in Guangxi was dominated by hydrological regulation and climate regulation. The ecosystem service value showed a spatial pattern of "low in the central region and high in the surrounding areas." (4) Grassland to forest and dryland to forest were the main types of ecological service income; Forest conversion to dryland is the most important type of ecological service loss. (5) As a whole, only dryland sensitivity index less than 0 during 2010-2015 had a negative impact on Ecosystem services values (ESV), while other time and land use type sensitivity index were all greater than 0 had a positive impact on ESV.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2021	133								108366	10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108366	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108366		NOV 2021											WOS:000730083400002
J	Prince, S; Safriel, U				Prince, Stephen; Safriel, Uriel			Land Use and Degradation in a Desert Margin: The Northern Negev	REMOTE SENSING												Degradation in a range of land uses was examined across the transition from the arid to the semi-arid zone in the northern Negev desert, representative of developments in land use taking place throughout the West Asia and North Africa region. Primary production was used as an index of an important aspect of dryland degradation. It was derived from data provided by Landsat measurements at 0.1 ha resolution over a 2500 km(2) study region-the first assessment of the degradation of a large area of a desert margin at a resolution suitable for interpretation in terms of human activities. The Local NPP Scaling (LNS) method enabled comparisons between the observed NPP and the potential, nondegraded, reference NPP. The potential was calculated by normalizing the actual NPP to remove the effects of environmental conditions that are not related to anthropogenic degradation. Of the entire study area, about 50% was found to have a significantly lower production than its potential. The degree of degradation ranged from small in pasture, around informal settlements, minimally managed dryland cropping, and a pine plantation, to high in commercial cropping and extreme in low-density afforestation. This result was unexpected as degradation in drylands is often attributed to pastoralism, and afforestation is said to offer remediation and prevention of further damage.

Landsat Hourly Evapotranspiration Flux Assessment Using Lysimeters for the Texas High Plains	WATER												Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the biggest data gaps in water management due to limited ET measurements, and further, spatial variability in ET is difficult to capture. Satellite-based ET estimation has great potential for water resources planning as it allows estimation of agricultural water use at field, landscape, and watershed scales. However, uncertainties with satellite data derived ET are a major concern. This study evaluates hourly satellite-based ET from 2001-2010 for the growing season (May October) under irrigated and dryland conditions for both tall and short crops. The evaluation was conducted using observed ET from four large weighing lysimeters at the United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) Conservation and Production Research Laboratory in Bushland, Texas. Hourly ET from satellite data were derived using the Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) model. Performance statistics showed that satellite-based hourly estimates compared to lysimeter measurements provided good performance with an root-mean-square error(RMSE) of 0.14 mm, Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.57, and R-2 of 0.62 for ET for dryland crops, and RMSE of 0.16, NSE of 0.63, and R-2 of 0.65 for irrigated crops. METRIC provided accurate hourly ET estimates that may be useful for irrigation scheduling and other water resources management purposes based on the hourly assessment.

Ecohydraulic model for designing environmental flows supports recovery of imperilled Murray cod (<i>Maccullochella peelii</i>) in the Lower Darling-<i>Baaka</i> River following catastrophic fish kills	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Large dryland and semi-arid rivers are among the world's most heavily modified ecosystems, and the Darling-Baaka River of eastern Australia highlights the challenges in conserving such ecosystems. Since 2000, the hydrology at the downstream end of the system (the Lower Darling River, LDR) has been transformed from a naturally near-perennial flowing system to an intermittent one by increased water abstraction, prolonged drought and climate change. This hydrological change has placed immense pressure on the native fish populations, such as the imperilled Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii), as evidenced by the 2018-19 catastrophic fish kills. Here we outline an ecohydraulic conceptual model for designing environmental flows to support spawning and recruitment of Murray cod. An environmental flow based on this model was released in 2016-17, following 524 consecutive days of continuous zero flows. The LDR flow consisted of an increased discharge in late winter-spring to promote broad-scale lotic (i.e. >0.3 m s(-1)) conditions, hydraulic complexity and continuous base flows to maintain connectivity and water quality. Monitoring of Murray cod during and following the flow revealed successful spawning and recruitment. This finding is significant because it provides justification for altering current water management policies that are failing to protect this nationally significant ecosystem.																			1323-1650	1448-6059					2022	73	2					247	258		10.1071/MF20377	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF20377		SEP 2021											WOS:000697230200001
J	Ansari, S; Sadeghi, H				Ansari, Sara; Sadeghi, Hossein			Carbon storage assessment in soil and plant organs: the role of <i>Prosopis</i> spp. on mitigate soil degradation	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Carbon sequestration is a process for stable storage of carbon dioxide. In this process, excess atmospheric carbon dioxide is stored by the aerial and underground organs of rangeland plants to reduce global warming. The aim of this study was to identify the relationship between some chemical properties of soil and ability of carbon storage in two plants, namely Prosopis cineraria and Prosopis juliflora in soil depth ranging between 0-15 and 15-30 cm. This research was carried out in Anbarabad region which is located at 258 km in the southeast of Kerman during 2016-2018. The present research was performed as a factorial experiment so that the first factor was the plant species and the control treatment and the second component was soil depth. Sampling was done from the shady soil of plants and the control area. Soil properties including organic carbon, bulk density, acidity, electrical conductivity and organic matter were analysed. The results indicated that the carbon stored at depths of 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm in the shade soil of P. cineraria was 21.39 and 24.36 t/ha, and in P. juliflora was 23.70 and 24.85 t/ha, and in control area is 19.83 and 21.31 t/ha. Also, the results of stepwise regression study showed that organic carbon percentage and bulk density are the most important factors affecting soil carbon sequestration.

Water abstrac-tion by the invasive tree Prosopis juliflora and by the native Senegalia senegal was compared in the dry Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia. Transpiration rates were quantified using the heat ratio method on six trees each of P. julifora and S. senegal, growing adjacent to each other in the same environment. Water use for P. juliflora trees ranges from 1 to 26 L/day (an average of 4.74 +/- 1.97), and that of S. senegal trees from 1 to 38 L/day (an average of 5.48 +/- 5.29 during two study years). For both species, soil heat, latent heat, and soil moisture status influenced the rates of sap flow of trees; in ad-dition, water use by P. juliflora trees was related to vapor pressure deficit; the higher the vapor pressure deficit, the higher the water abstraction by P. juliflora. Stand densities of pure P. juliflora and S. senegal were 1200-1600 trees and 400-600 trees per ha, respectively. At the stand scale, P. juliflora consumed approximately 6636 L/day/ha (tran-spiration: 242 mm per year) and S. senegal stands consumed 2723 L/day/ha (transpiration: 87 mm per year). That is, P. juliflora stands consumed three times more water than S. senegal stands, because of two reasons: (1) P. juliflora stands are denser than S. senegal stands, and denser stands consume more water than less dense stands, and (2) P. juliflora is evergreen and uses water all year-round, while S. senegal sheds its leaves during the peak dry seasons. Our findings suggest that, compared to S. senegal, P. juliflora invasion results in severe impacts on groundwater resources of the drylands of Ethiopia, with direct and indirect consequences to ecosystem services and rural livelihoods.

To evaluate the effect of livestock trampling disturbance on the carbon balance of biocrust-covered sandy soil, the net photosynthetic rate (NP), gross photosynthetic rate (GP), and soil respiration rate (R) of algaelichen mixed crust and moss crust before and after addition of 2, 5, 10, and 20 mm water under different trampling intensities (CK, no trampling; LD, trampling five times; MD, trampling 20 times; and HD, trampling 45 times on the undisturbed soil with an area of 415 cm(2)) were determined. The results showed the surface roughness decreased after an initial increase, whereas the biocrust cover decreased exponentially with increasing trampling intensity. There was negligible variation in surface soil NP, GP, and R (approximately 0.07 mu mol CO2 center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)) during dry soil periods. The carbon exchange rate in each trampling treatment changed significantly even after a small amount of rainfall (2 mm), but the surface soil still served as a carbon source. As simulated rainfall increased to >= 5 mm, the biocrust NP and GP declined (more negative values represent greater carbon uptake), and R continued to increase. Most notably, the CK and LD surfaces switched from carbon sources to carbon sinks, while the HD surface soil remained a carbon source. In terms of cumulative carbon exchange, LD trampling did not significantly increase carbon loss and even contributed to carbon gains compared with CK, whereas MD and HD caused severe carbon loss. In summary, impact of livestock trampling disturbance on the biocrust-covered soil carbon exchange is driven by rainfall, and its response to rainfall is mediated by surface roughness and biocrust cover. Specifically, surface soil carbon gains did not decrease or even increased slightly under light trampling, probably due to slight decreases in biocrust cover offset by the photosynthetic contribution of increased surface roughness, whereas heavy trampling resulted in severe carbon losses as the biocrust cover sharply decreased. This study emphasizes the important role of livestock trampling-induced changes in surface soil structure on the carbon exchange of sandy ecosystems.																			0016-7061	1872-6259				JAN 1	2023	429								116275	10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.116275	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.116275		NOV 2022											WOS:000954604100003

Unsaturated Soil Hydraulic Properties according to Double-Ring Infiltration of Saline Water	EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE												Inverse modeling is a relatively complex procedure that allows quick estimation of soil hydraulic properties, yielding parameters for both soil water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function from a single experiment. The purpose of this research was to evaluate saline water effect on unsaturated hydraulic properties of clay loamy nonsaline-sodic soil layers and estimate these properties inversely from infiltration data using a double-ring infiltrometer.Three levels of water salinity (EC) 1.1, 2.2 and 5.8 dS/m were used for each treatment (T1, T2, and T3, respectively). Soil samples at three depths (0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm) were taken to measure Mualem-van Genuchten (MVG) hydraulic parameters (theta(r), residual water content, theta(s), saturated water content, alpha and n, shape parameters, and K-s, lab saturated hydraulic conductivity). Soil hydraulic parameters were estimated with an inverse solution using HYDRUS-1D model and infiltration data. Besides, the most sensitive MVG parameters to infiltration data (n, theta(s), and K-s) were inversely estimated due to difficulty in estimating several parameters simultaneously. Results showed that salinity had no significant effect on soil water infiltration and soil hydraulic conductivity changes in the specified salinity range according to the variance analyses (ANOVA).The Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (C-e) between simulated (HYDRUS) and measured values of cumulative infiltration data was about 0.998, indicating an excellent match. Soil water retention, as well as unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity, were optimized with reasonable accuracy when the soil profile was assumed to be homogenous. In addition, simulated soil-water contents were quite similar to the measured values in which the values of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (C-e) for T1, T2, and T3 were 0.83, 0.85, and 0.85, respectively. In conclusion, the soil hydraulic parameters can be inversely estimated using the measured infiltration data through the double ring method if the soil is homogeneous.

In this study, we conducted anaerobic digestion of a mixture consisting of chicken manure and corn straw as the fermented raw material. The inoculum used was obtained from the residue of previously fermented chicken manure. To assess the inhibitory effect, we varied the ammonia levels within the range of 750-4250 mg/L by introducing ammonium chloride. The efficiency of aerobic digestion was monitored through the measurement of volatile fatty acids (VFA), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total inorganic carbon (TOC), and methane yield. Our results indicated that elevated levels of ammonia nitrogen had a suppressive impact on methane release, and this decrease followed a linear relationship with the increasing ammonia nitrogen load. Moreover, the addition of ammonia led to a slower release, with the maximum daily ammonia concentration observed at 15 days compared to the 6th day at lower ammonia levels. Furthermore, on the 40th day of aerobic digestion, the cumulative methane production at 4250 mg/L was inhibited by 41% compared to the 750 mg/L condition. The patterns of VFA, inorganic carbon, and COD reduction were consistent across all ammonia levels, with VFA and TOC levels being highest at the highest ammonia concentration and lowest at the lowest ammonia concentration. The accumulation of VFA resulted in a decrease in pH and a decline in methanogenic activity. Additionally, high ammonia levels altered the relative abundance of methanogens. Acetoclastic methanogens (Methanosaeta) exhibited a decrease in abundance, while hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Methanosaeta, Methanoculleus) and methylotrophic methanogens (Candidatus Methanoplasma) demonstrated an increase in abundance. Overall, our findings highlight the inhibitory effects of high ammonia concentrations on biogas production, providing insights into the changes in microbial composition and activity during anaerobic fermentation.

However, other cultivation strategies, such as colluvial slope agriculture, were practiced but have been less intensively studied and remain poorly understood. To begin to remedy this paucity of information, a joint education and research project between International Archaeological Research Institute, Inc., the University of Hawai'i at Manoa (UHM) Department of Anthropology, and Kamehameha Schools (KS) was conducted in Punalu'u Ahupua'a to examine an integrated slope agricultural, religious, and residential complex. Subsurface investigations and radiometric dating indicate that initial vegetation clearing of the area may have occurred as early as the late thirteenth to early fifteenth centuries AD. As early as the fifteenth century, some stands of economic trees were growing, which may have coincided with initial placement of boundary walls along some portions of the slopes. Major expansion of the surface agricultural infrastructure along the landscape occurred through the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries AD. Religious structures and associated features were built as early as the seventeenth century and later. These results situate colluvial slope agriculture within the broader context of traditional Hawaiian agronomic strategies and political and social processes across the Hawaiian archipelago.

J	Jiang, FY				Jiang, Fengyun			SSA research on electromagnetic scattering in arid zone	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MICROWAVE AND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES												This paper investigates the electromagnetic scattering characteristics in arid zone and proposes methods for monitoring and improving ecological agriculture, vegetation landscape and desertification in arid zone, based on the modified small slope approximation (SSA) electromagnetic scattering model. The dielectric properties of dryland soils are studied in the paper, and the variation curves of soil dielectric constant with humidity and electromagnetic frequency are plotted. In order to reproduce the geomorphological features of the dryland areas, a two-dimensional geometric model of the ground environment is established using Monte Carlo methods combined with Gaussian spectral functions. An algorithm model based on the modified SSA is developed, and the algorithm was validated and analyzed to verify its reliability. In the simulations, the southeastern region of Ejina Banner, Inner Mongolia was taken as a typical arid region, and the simulation parameters are obtained from the actual measurement data of the region. The study finds that the electromagnetic scattering characteristics of the arid zone are influenced by soil water content, ground roughness and incident wave electromagnetic frequency, and there is regularity. The results of this paper can be effectively combined with remote sensing technology to contribute to many researches on soil moisture inversion and ecological condition of vegetation, which are important in many aspects such as irrigation control, ecological research, vorticity covariance, and climatology of slope stability.																			1759-0787	1759-0795				2023 APR 21	2023									PII S1759078723000247	10.1017/S1759078723000247	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1759078723000247		APR 2023											WOS:000973180200001

However, there has been a scarcity of research on the combined effects of mulching types and nitrogen application on the growth and yield of soybean (Glycine max L.). In the present study, four nitrogen levels (N0: 0 kg N ha(-1), N1: 60 kg N ha(-1), N2: 120 kg N ha(-1), N3: 180 kg N ha(-1)) and four mulching methods (NM: no mulching, SM: straw mulching, FM: film mulching, SFM: straw and film mulching) were set so as to evaluate the effects of mulching methods and nitrogen application on dry matter accumulation, grain yield, water-nitrogen use efficiency, and economic benefits of soybean in Northwest China from 2021 to 2022. The results show that the dry matter accumulation, yield formation, water and nitrogen use efficiency, and economic benefits of soybean were improved under different mulching methods (SM, FM, and SFM) and nitrogen applications (N1-N3), and that the effect is the best when the nitrogen application rate is N2 and the mulching method is FM. As such, a conclusion could be drawn that suitable nitrogen application (120 kg ha(-1)) combined with film mulching was beneficial for the utilization of rainwater resources and soybean production in the dryland of Northwest China.

J	Mauki, D; Kilonzo, M				Mauki, Dickson; Kilonzo, Mhuji			Planting pit size determines successful tree seedling establishment in arid and semi-arid region of Tanzania	ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS												Tree cover enhancement in the agricultural lands of dryland region have been one of the most important aspect of evaluation and monitoring of plant density in Tanzania that targets in achieving global and national resto-ration goals. The on-farm tree establishment has gained momentum due to the numerous regulating and pro-visioning ecosystem services provided by the systems. This study was conducted as an on farm experiment to explore the influences of biophysical factors in adoption and performance of the tree establishment technologies in Chamwino district in Tanzania. Different planting pits sizes and mulch or manure and/or mulch were used as the treatment combinations for evaluating tree survival and growth potential. The assessment used a combi-nation of methods including tree inventory, reflection meetings, informal discussion and semi structured in-terviews collected using electronic data entry tools. The results showed that Senna siamea species performed better than other species than the others in terms of survival rate which was 50%. Comparatively, Melia volkensii species performed poor with the highest mortality rate of 8. The higher performance both survival and growth potential were observed in three times planting bag (3X) pits sizes with manure and both manure and mulch treatment applied. Thus, the research confirms that improvement of the socio and biophysical environment can have positive results on tree establishment and restoration in dryland regions.

Here, the authors study relationships of plant and soil microbial diversity with soil nutrient multifunctionality in 130 dryland sites in China, finding a shift towards greater importance of soil microbial diversity in arid conditions. Relationships between biodiversity and multiple ecosystem functions (that is, ecosystem multifunctionality) are context-dependent. Both plant and soil microbial diversity have been reported to regulate ecosystem multifunctionality, but how their relative importance varies along environmental gradients remains poorly understood. Here, we relate plant and microbial diversity to soil multifunctionality across 130 dryland sites along a 4,000 km aridity gradient in northern China. Our results show a strong positive association between plant species richness and soil multifunctionality in less arid regions, whereas microbial diversity, in particular of fungi, is positively associated with multifunctionality in more arid regions. This shift in the relationships between plant or microbial diversity and soil multifunctionality occur at an aridity level of similar to 0.8, the boundary between semiarid and arid climates, which is predicted to advance geographically similar to 28% by the end of the current century. Our study highlights that biodiversity loss of plants and soil microorganisms may have especially strong consequences under low and high aridity conditions, respectively, which calls for climate-specific biodiversity conservation strategies to mitigate the effects of aridification.					liu, kaiyuan/JHU-0258-2023; Jiang, Yuan/JED-3759-2023; lin, qing/JED-5250-2023; Zhang, Yihao/JGM-3514-2023; Aqeel, Muhammad/AAZ-1893-2020; Akram, Muhammad Adnan/CAG-0932-2022; deng, yan/JDW-8815-2023; jiang, lei/IWE-1124-2023; peng, jy/JMB-2297-2023; Lu, Xiaomei/IUQ-2139-2023; yang, xu/JMP-5558-2023; Gu, b/JNS-4761-2023; Zhao, YiAn/JFK-5881-2023; Deng, Jianming/AAN-2998-2020; Liu, Jie/JCP-1070-2023; Schmid, Bernhard/C-8625-2009; wei, xiao/ISB-6027-2023; Huang, YQ/JOK-7580-2023; Wang, Zhiqiang/ABC-6612-2020; ZHAO, S/IWV-4219-2023; Manan, Abdul/JEP-6892-2023; Gong, Haiyang/HGC-9100-2022; Deng, Jianming/F-3822-2011; Akram, Muhammad Adnan/CAH-3602-2022; Shi, Z/ISB-4324-2023; Hu, Weigang/CAH-3530-2022; He, Jin-Sheng/A-4053-2009; yang, yun/IZE-1092-2023; li, bai/JNE-1502-2023; Yang, Xiaoming/GRJ-9483-2022	Aqeel, Muhammad/0000-0003-0690-4783; Akram, Muhammad Adnan/0000-0003-3025-1217; peng, jy/0000-0001-9665-1059; Deng, Jianming/0000-0003-2432-6307; Schmid, Bernhard/0000-0002-8430-3214; Wang, Zhiqiang/0000-0002-2627-7062; Gong, Haiyang/0009-0003-9649-303X; Deng, Jianming/0000-0003-2432-6307; Akram, Muhammad Adnan/0000-0003-3025-1217; Hu, Weigang/0000-0003-1422-3726; He, Jin-Sheng/0000-0001-5081-3569; Yang, Xiaoming/0000-0002-1792-6921														2041-1723				SEP 9	2021	12	1							5350	10.1038/s41467-021-25641-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25641-0								34504089					WOS:000695204000010

The objectives were to assess the performance of this model in simulating the hydrological responses in arid watersheds then utilized to study the impact of YRB agricultural development project on transport of sediments in the YRB. Nine and three years of input data, namely from 2005 to 2013, were used to calibrate the model, whereas data from 2014 to 2015 were used for model validation. Time series plots as well as statistical measures, including the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSE) that range between 0 to 1 and -infinity to 1, respectively, between observed and simulated monthly runoff values were used to verify the SWAT simulation capability for the YRB. The SWAT model satisfactorily predicted mean monthly runoff values in the calibration and validation periods, as indicated by R-2 = 0.95 and NSE = 0.96 and R-2 = 0.91 and NSE = 0.63, respectively. The study confirmed the positive impact of soil conservation measures implemented in the YRB development project and confirmed that contouring can reduce soil loss from 15 to 44% during the study period.

Measuring the components of rainfall partitioning, however, has been a challenging task due to laborious-and time-consuming field experiments. In this study, to probe the influences of long-term afforestation on dynamic patterns of rainfall partitioning, the dominant sand-stabilizing shrub Haloxylon ammodendron at three different ages was selected for field measurements during the 2020-2021 growing season. The throughfall percentage for young H. ammodendron (YH, 75.9 %) was significantly higher than that for middle-aged H. ammodendron (MAH, 63.4 %) and mature H. ammodendron (MH, 62.4 %) (p < 0.05 for all cases). However, the inter-ception loss percentage of YH (22.3 %) was significantly lower than that for MAH (35.0 %) and MH (36.5 %) (p < 0.05 for all cases). No significant difference was found for stemflow percentage among YH (1.8 %), MAH (1.5 %) and MH (1.1 %). Smaller rainfall events contributed to a higher interception loss percentage and a lower net rainfall percentage for all ages. Both throughfall and stemflow percentage first showed increasing trends and then tended to be stable with increasing rain-fall amount and duration, whereas interception loss percentage showed the opposite patterns. Rainfall partitioning was significantly correlated with the plant area index, stem basal area and canopy height (p < 0.05 for all cases), which may account for significant differences in rainfall partitioning patterns, as all shrubs experienced the same weather conditions. The average funneling ratio was 56.6, 26.7 and 17.9 for YH, MAH and MH, respectively. These results suggested that H. ammodendron afforestation can have a significant impact on rainfall partitioning by reducing net rainfall reaching the soil and may have some implications for local water budget and ecosystem management in oasis-desert ecotones.					jin, bo/HPH-5081-2023														0048-9697	1879-1026				FEB 1	2023	858		2						159928	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159928	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159928		NOV 2022						36343808					WOS:000898667800014

Long-term effects of soil management practices on soil Zn chemical fractions and their availability to grain sorghum {<i>Sorghum vulgare</i> (L.)} grown in a yearly rotation with castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) in rainfed red Alfisol soils	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS												A study was conducted at Hayathnagar Research Farm of ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture to assess the long-term effects of soil management practices viz. tillage, residue application and N levels on soil Zn fractions and their contribution to soil Zn availability and uptake by grain sorghum grown in a yearly rotation with castor. Results of the study clearly revealed that tillage significantly influenced the Water soluble + Exchangeable Zinc (Zn-CA), zinc specifically sorbed by inorganic sites (Zn-ACC) and available Zinc (Zn-DTPA). However, the remaining Zn fractions were not influenced significantly. Residue application on long-term basis significantly increased the amount of zinc in all the fractions except water soluble + exchangeable Zinc (Zn-CA), and residual zinc (Zn-Res). The application of N @ 90 kg ha(-1)resulted in a higher amount of zinc in different fractions compared to control. The multiple regression analysis conducted between Zn-DTPA and zinc fractions revealed that the order of magnitude of the positive contribution of the zinc fractions toward zinc availability pool (DTPA-Zn) was: Zn-CA > Zn-ACC > Zn-OX > Zn-Res. The coefficient of multiple determination (R-2 = 0.89) was significant at p = .05 level of significance. The order of percent contribution of Zn fractions toward the sum total of all the fractions was: Zn-Res > Zn-PYR > Zn-OX > Zn-ACC > Zn-CA. The multiple regression studies also revealed that all the zinc fractions studied significantly contributed toward Zn uptake by the sorghum crop (R-2 = 0.99). Relatively, significantly higher Zn uptake was recorded by sorghum crop under minimum tillage (0.11 kg ha(-1)) as compared to conventional tillage (0.10 kg ha(-1)). The results of this study will be highly useful in regulating the Zn availability in soil through soil management practices.

Insights about biocrust effects on soil gas transport and aeration in drylands: Permeability, diffusivity, and their connection to hydraulic conductivity	GEODERMA												Soil gas transport properties and aeration are essential influencing factors of soil chemical and biochemical reactions, especially the respiration processes of plant roots and microorganisms. As ecosystem engineers in drylands, biocrusts may greatly alter surface soil gas transport properties and aeration, but their influences remain unclear and understudied. In a semiarid dryland ecosystem on the Chinese Loess Plateau, the air permeability of bare soil and three types of biocrusts (cyanobacterial, cyanobacterial-moss mixed, and moss crusts) were measured in-situ with naturally changing soil water content. Undisturbed soil samples were also taken for each treatment, and their air permeability and relative gas diffusivity at air-dried and near-saturated conditions, as well as saturated hydraulic conductivity, were determined in the laboratory. We further analyzed the relationship between saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability or relative gas diffusivity and calculated the gas and permeability continuity (specific air permeability and specific gas diffusivity) and tortuosity indexes at air-dry and near-saturation. Our results showed that biocrusts were associated with a significantly higher air permeability in contrast to bare soil, and the in situ mean air permeability ranked in order of moss crusts > mixed crusts > cyanobacterial crusts > bare soil. At air-dried condition, biocrusts increased surface soil air permeability by 26% and relative gas diffusivity by 46% as compared with bare soil through decreased surface soil bulk density. In contrast, at near saturation biocrusts decreased air permeability and relative gas diffusivity by 33% and 20%, respectively, which was attributed to pore-clogging by extracellular polymeric substances of biocrusts (3.37 vs. 2.27 mg g(-1)). Accordingly, at air-dried condition biocrusts increased specific air permeability by 11% and specific gas diffusivity by 30% but decreased tortuosity by 7%. In contrast, they decreased specific air permeability by 76% and specific gas diffusivity by 39% but increased tortuosity by 28% at near-saturated condition. Additionally, the saturated hydraulic conductivity of cyanobacterial, cyanobacterial-moss mixed, and moss crusts were respectively 77%, 69%, and 61% lower than that of bare soil. We found that the relationship between saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability or relative gas diffusivity of biocrusts at air-dried condition can be well fitted with a positive linear log-log model (R2 > 0.95). In general, the improved gas transport properties of surface soil caused by different types of biocrusts leads to better soil aeration, which in turn would facilitate microbial activity, soil respiration, and root growth; and impact surface soil water vapor movement induced by evaporation or condensation processes in drylands. Therefore, biocrusts should be carefully considered in further assessments of global dryland hydrology and carbon or nitrogen cycling under changing climate.

J	Eshleman, MM; Riginos, C				Eshleman, Magdalena M.; Riginos, Corinna			Potential to Improve Wyoming Big Sagebrush Establishment with a Root-Enhancement Seed Technology	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Restoration of the foundational species, big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.), of the sagebrush steppe biome has not kept pace with the loss of habitat, demanding new tools to improve its restoration. Seed enhancement technology (SET) is one approach that is increasingly being tested in native plant restoration as a means to overcome establishment barriers. Like many semiarid shrubs, sagebrush faces establishment barriers from inadequate moisture, competition from faster-growing grasses, and limited available nutrients. We performed a series of laboratory trials testing whether nutrient amendments could be applied to sagebrush seed using a SET to increase root length and biomass, thereby potentially increasing seedling survival. We initially tested 11 amendments applied directly to bare seeds; of these, a highphosphorus fertilizer resulted in a 2.7x increase in root biomass and 71-mm increase in root length over the control. We then tested incorporating this fertilizer at multiple concentrations into a pellet SET and a ground dust. Although the fertilizer, particularly at higher concentrations, conferred some enhancement to seedling biomass, the pellet treatments had substantially lower emergence and survival than bare seed and dust treatments. These results indicate the potential for a "root-enhancement" SET to benefit sagebrush and other species like it; they also illustrate some of the challenges of SET development for native species. Sagebrush has small seeds that typically need light to germinate. Further work is needed to develop an appropriate technology that does not negatively impact emergence but still provides enough nutrients for enhanced root growth. Field testing is also needed to determine if increases in root growth translate into greater survival. Given the low success rate of sagebrush seeding in restoration projects, however, we suggest that it is worth considering root-enhancement SET alongside other efforts to improve sagebrush establishment success.

Water Management causes increment of reservoir silting and reduction of water yield in the semiarid State of Ceara, Brazil	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES												The semiarid State of Ceara, Brazil, implemented its water management system in the early 1990s. The drought -prone State is densely populated and its supply strongly relies on surface reservoirs, whose yield reduces with silting. Using artificial neural networks and data from 141 monitored dams, we show that the silting ratio of the reservoirs significantly enhanced after the implementation of the water management system. An explanation for this fact is that, since the management started, water withdrawal increased, leading to lower reservoir levels at the beginning of the rainy season. This reduces the probability of spilling, which is the main mechanism of sediment outflow, thus causing excessive siltation. As a result, water availability is expected to reduce by 6% in 30 years, creating a clear contradiction with the management objectives. To tackle this problem, four actions are recommended: to include spilling in the operational rules, to reduce erosion in the basins, to execute sediment reuse policy, and to implement water-demand management.					; de Araujo, Jose Carlos/J-9629-2012	Alencar, Pedro/0000-0001-6221-8580; de Araujo, Jose Carlos/0000-0002-2649-151X													0895-9811	1873-0647				JAN	2023	121								104102	10.1016/j.jsames.2022.104102	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsames.2022.104102		NOV 2022											WOS:000891953700001

Partial afforestation can be a practical mitigation strategy if efficiently integrated with farms and pastures. Using an integrated surface-subsurface hydrological model, this study evaluates the water and salt dynamics and soil salinization conditions of a rural intermittent catchment in the semi -arid climate of southeast Australia subjected to four different partial afforestation configurations under different climate change scenarios, as predicted by several general circulation models. The results show that the locations of afforested areas can induce a retarding effect in the outflow of groundwater salt, with tree planting at lower elevations showing the steadier salt depletion rates. Moreover, except for the configuration with trees planted near the outlet of the catchment, the streamflow is maintained under all other configurations. It appears that under both Representative Concentration Pathways considered (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), the Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model represents the fastest salt export scheme, whereas the Canadian Earth System Model and the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate represent the slowest salt export scheme. Overall, it is found that the location of partial afforestation generally plays a more significant role than the climate change scenarios.

Using Vegetation Guilds to Predict Bird Habitat Characteristics in Riparian Areas	WETLANDS												Within arid regions riparian forests support high bird diversity compared to surrounding uplands. In these same regions, water demands for agriculture, urbanization, and recreation have altered the structure and composition of riparian forests and degraded bird habitat. Along rivers, plants with similar responses to flood disturbance and water availability can be grouped into functional guilds using traits. The use of plant guilds can mechanistically link bird distributions to traits such as canopy height, specific leaf area, and growth form. We demonstrate that bird species richness, abundance, and diversity are related to the heterogeneity of vegetation structure and plant guilds along a perennial river in the southwestern U.S. High-quality habitat can be explained by canopy cover, foliage height diversity, and foliage cover in the understory. The tall tree guild (dominated bySalix gooddingii) was the strongest predictor of bird habitat followed by drought tolerant shrubs (dominated byProsopis velutina) demonstrating that riparian shrublands should be considered for conservation alongside gallery forests. Projected changes in flow regimes may result in homogenization of riparian vegetation and reduce habitat quality for migratory and breeding land birds. Practitioners can use developed methods to group vegetation by guilds to focus bird conservation efforts in arid ecosystems.

J	Hobbs, N; Hug, J; de Pee, S				Hobbs, Nora; Hug, Julia; de Pee, Saskia			High Non-affordability of Diets and Malnutrition in Africa's Drylands: Systems Analysis to Guide Action	FOOD AND NUTRITION BULLETIN												Background: Africa's drylands have unique food environments and persistently high rates of wasting and stunting. This article documents findings and experiences from Fill the Nutrient Gap (FNG) processes conducted in 7 Sub-Saharan African countries that include drylands.Objective: This study advocates for a comprehensive consideration of the specific food environments of drylands using a novel analytical framework and shares findings and best practices for improving food and nutrition security in these contexts.Methods: Three analyses are combined. Analysis 1 re-analyzes cost and non-affordability of nutrient-adequate diets indicators from FNGs by reclassifying areas as drylands and non-drylands. Analysis 2 uses malnutrition estimates in drylands and non-drylands and examines associations with non-affordability of nutrient-adequate diets. Analysis 3 synthesizes evidence from FNG processes to document how those indicators were used to engage stakeholders and inform nutrition policy and practice in drylands.Results: The nutrient-adequate diet of a 5-person household was 2.60 USD (41%) more expensive in drylands. A nutrient-adequate diet was not affordable to 71% of households in drylands, compared to 55% in non-drylands. Wasting and stunting prevalence and non-affordability of nutrient-adequate diets were simultaneously high in drylands.Conclusion: The article presents new evidence that contributes to elucidate specific characteristics of the food environment of Africa's drylands and suggests a framework to improve on those factors systematically. The FNG is innovative in combining an analytical framework with multistakeholder review and dialogue, as well as modeling of possible strategies, to build consensus on possible transformation pathways to improve diets in drylands.																			0379-5721	1564-8265				DEC	2023	44	2_SUPPL		2_	SI		S45	S57		10.1177/03795721231178065	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03795721231178065								37850927					WOS:001100350200006

However, it is unclear how grazing exclusion reduces the negative effects of overgrazing on the microbial community in the Caatinga biome. In our study, we assessed the bacterial community under three different soil managements in a semiarid region of the Brazilian Caatinga biome, as follows: (a) Native Caatinga vegetation (natural); (b) grazing exclusion (exclusion); and (c) overgrazing (grazed). The bacterial community was assessed through the sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and analyzed soil chemical and physical properties were correlated with the bacterial community structure. Our results demonstrate that exclusion increases the content of soil carbon and nitrogen, and bacterial diversity, while grazed showed a reduction of similar to 31 and similar to 43% in organic C, compared to exclusion and natural, respectively. However, the changes in bacterial diversity were more expressive in a specific site (No. 1), suggesting that exclusion strategy could be a context-dependent and complex approach to protecting or improving Caatinga soils. Moreover, grazed areas might restrain the potential of bacterial diversity to sustain ecosystem functions since nonbeneficial elements increased in grazed treatments, which presented a negative correlation with the bacterial community. Our study provides novel evidence that high-intensity disturbance by overgrazing could not only reduce soil fertility but it may also restrain bacterial composition, with implications on ecosystem functioning. The Caatinga soil microbiome may be unable to maintain ecosystem services such as plant and animals' development under overgrazing management.

Short; Konings, Alexandra G.; Gentine, Pierre; Entekhabi, Dara			Patterns of plant rehydration and growth following pulses of soil moisture availability	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Plant hydraulic and photosynthetic responses to individual rain pulses are not well understood because field experiments of pulse behavior are sparse. Understanding individual pulse responses would inform how rainfall intermittency impacts terrestrial biogeochemical cycles, especially in drylands, which play a large role in interannual global atmospheric carbon uptake variability. Using satellite-based estimates of predawn plant and soil water content from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, we quantify the timescales of plant water content increases following rainfall pulses, which we expect bear the signature of whole-plant mechanisms. In wetter regions, we find that plant water content increases rapidly and dries along with soil moisture, which we attribute to predawn soil-plant water potential equilibrium. Global drylands, by contrast, show multiday plant water content increases after rain pulses. Shorter increases are more common following dry initial soil conditions. These are attributed to slow plant rehydration due to high plant resistances using a plant hydraulic model. Longer multi-day dryland plant water content increases are attributed to pulse-driven growth, following larger rain pulses and wetter initial soil conditions. These dryland responses reflect widespread drought recovery rehydration responses and individual pulse-driven growth responses, as supported by previous isolated field experiments. The response dependence on moisture pulse characteristics, especially in drylands, also shows ecosystem sensitivity to intra-annual rainfall intensity and frequency, which are shifting with climate change.

Production from Co-application of Biogas Slurry with Chemical Fertilizer and Effects on Soil Quality in a Semi-arid Region of South Africa	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS												Small-scale farmers still rely mostly on chemical fertilizers (CF) for crop production. Recently, CF have become expensive and could in some way have a negative impact on soil quality after long-term application. However, co-application of biogas slurry (BGS) with CF could help reduce farming costs while improving crop production and soil health. The study was a field experiment conducted in 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 growing seasons and arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replicates. The treatments were based on percentages of recommended Nitrogen (N) rates of 120 kg N ha(-1) for maize production. The BGS/CF treatments were (i) 0/0, (ii) 0/120, (iii) 24/96, (iv) 48/72, (v) 72/48, (vi) 96/24, (vii) 120/0 kg N ha(-1). BGS/CF (48/72) treatment resulted into higher dry matter yield in 2016-2017, which was higher than all other treatment combinations, while in the 2017-2018 season, treatment of (0/120) resulted into higher dry matter than all other treatment combinations. The (48/72) and (0/120) treatments resulted into similar grain yield in 2016-2017 season. (48/72), (72/48), and (120/0) treatments had higher N, P, K, Ca, and Mg uptake than (0/0), (0/120), 26 (24/96), and (96/24) treatments in both seasons. Soil pH, total N, K, and Mg were high from (120/0) than all other treatments in 2016-2017 while in the 2017-2018, (48/72), had higher OC, P, and K after maize harvest. The findings of this study show that co-application of BGS/CF at 48/72 and 72/48 have maize yield benefits compared to the two resources, BGS/CF (120/0) and BGS/CF (0/120), applied separately in soil.

Many invasive plants have the capacity to replace native species and alter the net amount and spatial distribution of rainfall reaching the soil. In this paper, we aimed to compare the rainfall partitioning for the invader Ligustrum lucidum and the dominant native Lithraea molleoides, to evaluate the influence of morphological characteristics on stemflow generation in both species, and to explore spatiotemporal patterns of throughfall at stand scale. Stemflow percentage for L. lucidum was hugely higher than for L. molleoides (18 and 1%, respectively), which overcompensated its lower throughfall percentage (58.1 and 68.6%, respectively). Interception losses were lower for L. lucidum than for L. molleoides (23.2 and 30.6%, respectively). The minimum rainfall amount needed to generate throughfall and stemflow was 1.8 and 0.5 mm for L. lucidum, while 2.2 and 7.2 mm for L. molleoides. The differences in morphological characteristics between species mainly explained the stemflow generation. The increment on tree basal area, projected canopy area, and number of branches favored stemflow in L. lucidum, but not in L. molleoides. The throughfall spatial patterns showed that the dripping from different canopy densities was homogenous in L. lucidum stands, whereas throughfall increase towards more opened-canopies in L. molleoides stands. Lateral inflows were registered from small-scale crown sections at both forest stands, but less frequent in L. lucidum stands. The time stability of throughfall pattern differed between forest stands. Based on our results, relatively higher stemflow and lower interception losses for L. lucidum than for L. Molleoides may represent a competitive advantage in terms of plant invasion in waterlimited ecosystems. These findings highlight the need for further inquiries determining the underlying role of rainfall partitioning in the invasion process of woody species.

The microbiome of deep soils (>1 m) is expected to be relatively stable and highly independent from climatic conditions. Much less is known, however, on how these microbial communities vary along climate gradients. Here, we used amplicon sequencing to investigate bacteria, archaea, and fungi along fifteen 18-m depth profiles at 20-50-cm intervals across contrasting aridity conditions in semi-arid forest ecosystems of China's Loess Plateau. Our results showed that bacterial and fungal alpha diversity and bacterial and archaeal community similarity declined dramatically in topsoil and remained relatively stable in deep soil. Nevertheless, deep soil microbiome still showed the functional potential of N cycling, plant-derived organic matter degradation, resource exchange, and water coordination. The deep soil microbiome had closer taxa-taxa and bacteria-fungi associations and more influence of dispersal limitation than topsoil microbiome. Geographic distance was more influential in deep soil bacteria and archaea than in topsoil. We further showed that aridity was negatively correlated with deep-soil archaeal and fungal richness, archaeal community similarity, relative abundance of plant saprotroph, and bacteria-fungi associations, but increased the relative abundance of aerobic ammonia oxidation, manganese oxidation, and arbuscular mycorrhizal in the deep soils. Root depth, complexity, soil volumetric moisture, and clay play bridging roles in the indirect effects of aridity on microbes in deep soils. Our work indicates that, even microbial communities and nutrient cycling in deep soil are susceptible to changes in water availability, with consequences for understanding the sustainability of dryland ecosystems and the whole-soil in response to aridification. Moreover, we propose that neglecting soil depth may underestimate the role of soil moisture in dryland ecosystems under future climate scenarios.

Location Tibetan Plateau. Major taxa Alpine grassland plants. Time period 2015. Methods We conducted a transect survey across grasslands to measure community aboveground net primary production and carbon concentration. Additionally, phenology indicator data (SOS and POS) were extracted from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) normalized difference vegetation index version 3 database. Next, we used 'changepoint' analysis to detect the patterns of CARs, and performed linear regression and one-way ANOVA to explore the variability of CARs in response to the environmental factors. Ultimately, the total effects of environmental factors on CARs were illustrated by a structural equation model. Results Our results indicated that three CAR patterns were detected, which are low-CAR (0.15 g/m(2)/day), medium-CAR (0.31 g/m(2)/day) and high-CAR (0.84 g/m(2)/day) patterns. We found that the availabilities of water and heat mediated CARs by regulating soil nutrition variability, and that drought climate and insufficient soil resources co-constrained the community CAR at long time-scales. In contrast, high CAR could be explained by more water and heat availability via either direct or indirect effects on soil moisture and soil nutrients. Main conclusions Our findings highlight that water and heat availability are critical driving factors in ecological carbon accumulation processes undergoing climate change. Meanwhile, the vegetative phenology also has important effect on carbon accumulation. Consequently, we propose incorporating the dynamic interactions between plant phenology and plant carbon into the ecological carbon cycle model to improve our understanding of resource utilization and survival strategies of plants under environmental change.

The treatments were compared with mineral fertilization (MF) plus a control treatment (no N fertilization). Soil microstructure and types of voids, earthworm community and its bioturbation were studied using micromorphological methods. Two earthworm species, Koinodrilus roseus and Nicodrilus trapezoides were identified; the latter was not present in the SC treatments. Earthworm abundance and biomass were not affected by fertilization. Pig slurry increased bioturbation associated with earthworm activity, improved soil microstructure (crumb type) and increased the biopore presence (compound packing voids). The control and MF plots showed a platy to massive microstructure with an absence of faunal chambers. In SC plots, non-mixed soil-organic materials were observed and soil vughs were not visible. Composition differences between SC and PS and the total amount of OM applied may have had an impact on the activity and species of earthworms; such changes can be an early indicator of further potential impacts on soil quality, however further contaminant studies are needed to validate this initial assessment.

In this study, we revise our error model for generating Forecast Guided Stochastic Scenarios (FoGSS) to produce statistically re-liable long-range (12-month) forecasts for ephemeral rivers. FoGSS features an error model with four stages: data transformation, bias-correction, an autoregressive error model and the statistical distribution of residuals. We revise the fourth stage of FoGSS with a parameter estimation method that uses data censoring to account for zero values in both observations and forecasts. This allows FoGSS to produce statistically reliable ensemble forecasts in even highly ephemeral streams (with > 50% zero flows). We apply FoGSS to conventional ensemble hydrological prediction (ESP) forecasts for 50 Australian catchments, including 26 ephemeral rivers. We show that FoGSS improves the accuracy of ESP forecasts at short lead times, while at long lead times FoGSS forecasts transition to climatology-like forecasts. FoGSS forecasts are reliable in ensemble spread at individual lead times and for volumes aggregated over lead times, even in highly ephemeral rivers. FoGSS forecasts pave the way for operational long-range forecasts in ephemeral rivers, meeting a key need for improved water management.

Understanding the long-term natural variability of dryland regions via paleo-reconstructions is therefore highly desirable. The delta O-18 of two coeval modern speleothems from Cathedral Cave, Wellington, in semi-arid SE Australia are compared to the instrumental record to assess its efficacy as a proxy of past hydrological variability. Stalagmite delta O-1(8) was modulated by the frequency of recharge events and epikarst evaporation of storage water. Prolonged intervals between recharge events, such as droughts, resulted in higher stalagmite delta O-1(8). Conversely, periods with more frequent recharge events and a positive water balance, resulted in lower delta O-1(8). Disequilibrium cave processes are likely to be enhanced during dry conditions, although it is argued that these will modulate delta O-1(8)spel in the same direction as epikarst evaporation, effectively amplifying the response of delta O-1(8)spel. Extreme events, such as floods and droughts, were also captured in the stalagmite records, although potentially with a lag of several years. We verify that modern speleothems from semi-arid regions can be used to reconstruct hydroclimate due to variations in delta O-1(8)spel modulated by karst processes. Such records are archives of past changes in recharge rather than precipitation amount or surface temperature, as is commonly applied to speleothem records from non-water-limited regions.

Here, we examined the floodplain forests in the indigenous territory of Papasena, within the Mamberamo-Foja Wildlife Reserve in the Mamberamo Basin. As part of a training activity with local researchers, students, and civil servants, and with the permission and assistance of the local people, we employed various methods including the field surveys detailed here. We used variable-area tree plots, transects for non-trees and soil sampling, and local informants to document 17 plots: four in old-growth dryland forest, five in old-growth swamp forests (two seasonally flooded and three permanently wet including one dominated by sago, Metroxylon sagu Rottb.), five in secondary forest (fallows), and three in gardens (two in swamps and one on dryland). In total, we measured 475 trees over 10 cm in diameter at 1.3 m (dbh). The swamp forests had high local basal areas (highest value 45.1 m(2) ha(-1)) but relatively low statures (20 m but with emergent trees over 40 m). In total, 422 morphospecies from 247 genera and 89 different families were distinguished. These included 138 tree species and 284 non-tree plant species. A quarter (105) of the morphospecies lacked species-level identifications. The woody families Rubiaceae, Araceae, Moraceae, and Euphorbiaceae were especially diverse, with 20 or more morphospecies each. Tree richness was highest in dryland forest (plot 7 having 28 species in 40 stems over 10 cm dbh) with more variation in the flooded forests. Non-tree vegetation showed similar patterns ranging from 65 species in one 40-by-5 m primary forest plot to just 5 in one seasonally flooded forest plot. The local people identified many plants as useful. Among trees, at least 59 species were useful for construction (the most common use), while, for non-trees, medicinal uses were most frequent. Inceptisols dominated (12 plots), followed by Ultisols and Entisols (3 and 2 plots, respectively). Drainage appeared poor and nutrient availability low, while land-suitability criteria implied little potential for crops aside from sago. We discuss the implication of local practises and more recent developments that may threaten the conservation of these floodplain systems. We underline the key role of local people in the oversight and protection of these ecosystems.

Studies about the long-term changes in the effect of drought stress on dryland ecosystems under global warming are still insufficient so far. Here we comprehensively investigate long-term changes in droughts and the effect of drought stresses on ecosystems across global drylands for 1982-2015, and further reveal changes in the configurations of the key meteorological and ecological factors of droughts, by using observation and reanalysis datasets. Climatically, the spatial patterns of intensity, occurrence, duration and severity of all drought categories across global drylands are highly consistent with each( -1) other. Associated with severe droughts, drylands witness insufficient precipitation (-12.4 mm mon area-averaged over global drylands), warmer temperature (0.6 degrees C), water deficit (-19.0 mm mon(-1)), higher atmospheric aridity (0.06 kPa), lower soil moisture (-0.03 m(3) m(-3)), suppressed vegetation growth and declined carbon uptake (-0.13 g C m(-2 )d(-1)). The affected area, occurrence, duration and severity for mild to severe droughts in drylands and the anomalies of meteorological and ecological factors for all drought categories have increased significantly during 1982-2015. Specifically, when droughts occur, the precipitation deficit is weakened at a rate of 3.7-9.6 mm mon(-1) (30 yr)(-1), the higher temperature (atmospheric aridity) is further intensified at 0.71-0.87 degrees C (30 yr)(-1)(39-47 Pa (30 yr)(-1)), the water (soil moisture) deficit is relieved at 1.7-5.1 mm mon(-1) (30 yr)-1(4.1x10(-3)-7.4x10(-3 )m(3) m(-3) (30 yr)(-1)), and the suppressed vegetation growth is generally alleviated at 0.98x10(-2)-1.2x10(-2) (30 yr)(-1). Since the 2000s, the increasing trend in the suppressed vegetation growth during droughts tends to stagnate over about 50% of the dryland area. By checking the probability density function, the configurations of the key meteorological and ecological factors of droughts show significant differences between the periods before and after 2000. The probability of drought stress caused by precipitation and soil moisture deficit has decreased by 20% and 10%, respectively, while that caused by higher temperature and atmospheric aridity has been doubled, and increased by 26% and 15%, respectively. Thus, the impact of drought stress on dryland ecosystems caused by atmospheric aridity are increasing under global warming.

Sodium deficiency in lucerne (<i>Medicago sativa</i>) forage in southern Australia and the effect of sodium and barley supplementation on the growth rate of lambs grazing lucerne	ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE												Context. Liveweight gains (LWGs) of lambs grazing lucerne (Medicago saliva L.) in the mixed-farming zone of Australia commonly do not match predicted rates of growth. It has been suggested that this could be due to sodium (Na) deficiency or an imbalance in the crude protein : metabolisable energy ratio (CP : ME). Aims. This research aimed to determine whether sodium concentration in lucerne is below requirements for growing lambs and whether supplementation with salt (NaCl) and/or barley grain would increase LWG of lambs grazing lucerne. Methods. Pluck-samples were collected along a transect in 65 paddocks containing lucerne pasture in southern Australia. Herbage that most likely represented the animal diet was 'plucked', avoiding the less digestible plant parts. Two replicated grazing experiments using different cohorts of lambs compared LWG of unsupplemented lambs with lambs given supplements of salt and/or barley. Key results. The survey of lucerne pastures found that Na concentrations were below published requirements (0.07 g Na/kg DM) for growing lambs in 85% of samples collected from dryland lucerne pastures, but were above lamb requirements in 95% of samples collected from lucerne pastures gown under spray irrigation, which suggests a degree of salinity in the irrigation water. Supplementation with salt or barley did not affect LWG of lambs in Experiment 1, and residual feed on-offer did not differ among treatments. Salt increased LWG by 14% in Experiment 2 (292 g/lamb.day vs 256 g/lamb.day in those without access to salt; P = 0.03), with a return on investment of 1220%. Supplementation with whole barley did not increase (P > 0.05) LWG of lambs grazing lucerne. Barley supplementation resulted in higher residual feed on-offer in Experiment 2, suggesting a substitution of barley for lucerne. Mean LWG in Experiment 1 (192 g/lamb.day) was lower than in Experiment 2 (274 g/lamb.day), suggesting that the lack of response to salt supplementation in Experiment 1 may have been due to lamb growth rates being restricted by other factors such as reduced leaf availability and diet quality. Conclusions and implications. Results of the survey and grazing experiments confirm that Na concentration of dryland lucerne in southern Australia is commonly below lamb requirements. Producers should consider Na supplementation for lambs grazing dryland lucerne pastures as a way to increase lamb growth rates.

This variability introduces great unpredictability in the dynamic management of animal grazing. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of two complementary tools (satellite images, Sentinel-2 and proximal optical sensor, OptRx) for the calculation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), to monitor in a timely manner indicators of pasture quality (moisture content, crude protein, and neutral detergent fiber). In two consecutive years (2018/2019 and 2019/2020) these tools were evaluated in six fields representative of dryland pastures in the Alentejo region, in Portugal. The results show a significant correlation between pasture quality degradation index (PQDI) and NDVI measured by remote sensing (R-2 = 0.82) and measured by proximal optical sensor (R-2 = 0.83). These technological tools can potentially make an important contribution to decision making and to the management of livestock production. The complementarity of these two approaches makes it possible to overcome the limitations of satellite images that result (i) from the interference of clouds (which occurs frequently throughout the pasture vegetative cycle) and (ii) from the interference of tree canopy, an important layer of the Montado ecosystem. This work opens perspectives to explore new solutions in the field of Precision Agriculture technologies based on spectral reflectance to respond to the challenges of economic and environmental sustainability of extensive livestock production systems.

While the effects of photovoltaic panels on soil moisture content and plant biomass in arid ecosystems have been recognized, little is known about their influence on soil microbial communities. Here, we employed a combination of quantitative PCR, high-throughput sequencing, and soil property analysis to investigate the responses of soil microbial communities to solar panel installation. We also report on the responses of plant communities within the same solar farm. Our findings showed that soil microbial communities responded differently to the shading and precipitation-alternation effects of the photovoltaic panels in an arid ecosystem. By redirecting rainwater to the lower side, photovoltaic panels stimulated vegetation biomass and soil total organic carbon content in the middle and in front of the panels, positively contributing to carbon storage. The shade provided by the panels promoted the co-occurrence of soil microbes but inhibited the abundance of 16S rRNA gene in the soil. Increase in precipitation reduced 18S rRNA gene abundance, whereas decrease in precipitation led to decline in plant aboveground biomass, soil prokaryotic community alpha diversity, and dehydrogenase activity under the panels. These findings highlight the crucial role of precipitation in maintaining plant and soil microbial diversities in dryland ecosystems and are essential for estimating the potential risks of large-scale solar power plants on local and global climate change in the long term.					bi, yu/JOK-3859-2023															1664-302X				AUG 1	2023	14								1190650	10.3389/fmicb.2023.1190650	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1190650								37588884					WOS:001048781600001

Although hillslope asymmetry is documented worldwide, the role of microclimatic factors in the evolution of dryland cliffs has received little attention. Here, we address this gap by quantifying aspect-dependent bedrock weathering, slope-rill morphology, and subcliff clast transport rates in the hyperarid Negev desert, Israel, based on light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-derived topography, clast-size measurements, and cosmogenic 10Be concentrations. Cliff retreat rates were evaluated using extrapolated profiles from dated talus flatirons and 10Be measurements from the cliff face and sub-cliff sediments. We document systematic, aspect-dependent patterns of south-facing slopes being less steep and finer-grained relative to east- and north-facing aspects. In addition, cliff retreat and clast transport rates on slopes of the south-facing aspect are faster compared to the other aspects. Our data demonstrate that bedrock weathering of the cliff face and the corresponding grain size of cliff-derived clasts delivered to the slopes constitute a first-order control on cliff retreat and sediment transport rates. We demonstrate that the morphology of the cliff and the pattern of bedrock weathering co-vary with the solar in hyperarid regions is modulated by aspect dependent solar radiation. These results help to better understand interactions between climate and dryland surface processes.																			0016-7606	1943-2674				JUL	2023	135	7-8					1955	1966		10.1130/B36442.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B36442.1													WOS:001051785100005

However, it is unclear how PFM treatment affects soil microbial communities, especially with respect to community diversity, assembly processes, and co-occurrence patterns in multiple sites. In the present study, we explored the effects of traditional flat planting (TP) and PFM on the crop yield as well as the soil quality, bacterial and fungal diversity, community composition, assembly processes, and co-occurrence networks in broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) fields in northern China. The results showed that compared with TP, PFM significantly enhanced soil hydrothermal conditions and soil nutrients, thereby improving the agronomic characteristics and yield of broomcorn millet in the nine study sites. Furthermore, PFM significantly reduced the fungal alpha diversities and changed the fungal community composition and relative abundances of some bac-terial and fungal taxa. Random forest (RF) analysis indicated that fungal alpha diversity, soil temperature, and pH were the most important factors affecting broomcorn millet yield. PFM decreased the stochastic processes of the fungal community, also reduced the complexity and stability of the bacterial and fungal networks, which was reflected in the lower number of nodes, edges, ACC, and degree. Moreover, PFM also altered the bacterial and fungal keystone taxa. In summary, we were able to accurately estimate the influence of PFM on soil quality and microbial ecology, and our results provide valuable information for the sustainable development of dryland agriculture in northern China.

The effect of increased anthropogenic nitrogen deposition on N2O and NO emissions in desert ecosystems is unclear, especially in non-growing seasons when the surface is covered with snow. In this study, nitrogen applications were performed on biological soil crusts (lichen crust and moss crust, bare sand for control) in the Gurbantunggut Desert, Northwest China. We measured the fluxes of N2O and NO and related nitrogen cycle functional gene abundances in winter for three-years period. Nitrogen addition significantly affected N2O emissions and increased the abundances of key functional gene for nitrogen cycle, while it only slightly influenced NO emissions. These effects of nitrogen addition depended on composition of biological soil crusts. For bare sand and lichen crust, nitrogen addition significantly increased N2O emissions, whereas for moss crust, only a negligible effect was observed. Meanwhile, significant differences in nitrogen cycle functional gene abundances were found among different composition of biological soil crusts. Abundance of amoA, narG, and nosZ genes were highly related to N2O and NO emissions. Thus, our results indicate that gaseous nitrogen emissions were generally increased by nitrogen addition through their effects on related functional microbial groups. The effects were regulated by composition of biological soil crusts which can buffer the effects of increasing nitrogen addition during winter.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				OCT 1	2022	841								156779	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156779	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156779								35724796					WOS:000827853700001
J	Tugjamba, N; Walkerden, G; Miller, F				Tugjamba, Navchaa; Walkerden, Greg; Miller, Fiona			Adaptation strategies of nomadic herders in northeast Mongolia: climate, globalisation and traditional knowledge	LOCAL ENVIRONMENT												Herders in Mongolia have adapted to changing environmental conditions over thousands of years through innovations in pasture and herd management practices, knowledge, collective institutions and mobility strategies, yet they now face unprecedented climate risks threatening their livelihoods, economies and ways of life. This paper presents the results of a study into how herder communities adapt to climate change and the potential role an ecosystem services approach could play in informing the development of effective adaptation strategies. The findings are based on semi-structured interviews with herders, key informants, focus group discussions and a survey of nomadic households in Northeast Mongolia. The benefits of pasture ecosystem services have changed considerably due to climatic and socio-economic changes in the Mongolian steppe resulting in degradation of the pastureland and water resources. The ways that traditional ecological knowledge and practices can support adaptation to climate change are explored. In particular, the seasonal movement of nomads represents a valuable form of knowledge and practice of adaptation in response to the changes in temperate dryland ecosystems. To continue to maintain mobility as part of adaptation strategies other adaptation actions are required, such as the implementation of an appropriate livestock insurance systems that addresses climate and weather risks, and restoration of dryland ecosystem services, notably through reforestation and improvement of water supplies. Further changes in the pastureland ecosystems may lead to further adaptations in nomadic livelihoods, leveraging nomadic herders' knowledge of local ecosystem services.

Comparisons with wheat reveal root anatomical and histochemical constraints of rice under water-deficit stress	PLANT AND SOIL												Aims To face the challenge of decreasing freshwater availability for agriculture, it is important to explore avenues for developing rice genotypes that can be grown like dryland cereals. Roots play a key role in plant adaptation to dry environments. Methods We examined anatomical and histochemical root traits that affect water acquisition in rice (Oryza sativa) and wheat (Triticum aestivum). These traits and root growth were measured at two developmental stages for three rice and two wheat cultivars that were grown in pots under three water regimes. Results Wheat roots had larger xylem sizes than rice roots, which potentially led to a higher axial conductance, especially under water-deficit conditions. Suberization, lignification and thickening of the endodermis in rice roots increased with increasing water deficit, resulting in stronger radial barriers for water flow in rice than in wheat, especially near the root apex. In addition, water deficit strongly impeded root growth and lateral root proliferation in rice, but only slightly in wheat, and cultivars within a species differed little in these responses. The stress sensitivity of rice attributes was slightly more prominent at vegetative than at flowering stages. Conclusions Rice root characteristics, which are essential for growth under inundated conditions, are not conducive to growth under water deficit. Although rice roots show considerable plasticity under different watering regimes, improving root xylem size and reducing the radial barriers would be required if rice is to grow like dryland cereals.					ouyang, wenjng/CAF-0519-2022; yin, xinyou/ACV-7358-2022	ouyang, wenjing/0000-0002-0538-9604; Yin, Xinyou/0000-0001-8273-8022													0032-079X	1573-5036				JUL	2020	452	1-2					547	568		10.1007/s11104-020-04581-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-020-04581-6		JUN 2020											WOS:000541224400003

Aridity is expected to increase in grassland biomes with climate change, which may influence soil C dynamics through its effects on plant productivity and biomass allocation (i.e., the root/shoot ratio). However, it remains unclear on how aridity controls root versus shoot contributions to soil organic carbon (SOC) pools in grasslands. Here we investigated plant biomass allocation, plant and soil C isotopic signature, soil microbial biomass, SOC stock and its respective heavy versus light factions along a 1500 km aridity gradient (0.47 < aridity < 0.79) across steppe grasslands in northern China. We identified a central role of aridity in the cascading chain of SOC formation and stability. Both plant biomass and SOC decreased with aridity, but root/shoot ratio increased with aridity. Isotopic and regression analyses revealed that SOC were primarily contributed by shoots in wet grasslands (aridity < 0.61), but more by roots in drier areas (aridity >= 0.61). These are consistent with patterns of microbial biomass and its fraction to SOC, both of which decreased with aridity, indicating SOC are more contributed by microbial biomass in wet sites. Similarly, microbial C was also derived mainly from shoots in wet grasslands but from roots in drier areas. Such changes in plant biomass allocation and dominant sources of SOC along increasing aridity explain an elevating fraction of heavy C in SOC, suggesting SOC in drier sites are stabler. Our study thus highlights that aridity strongly controls the pool size and stability of SOC by influencing the relative contributions of roots and shoots to SOC in steppe grasslands. As climate change continues to unfolds, our findings have important implications for predicting steppe SOC stocks and their stability in the future.

This study was conducted to investigate the effect of maize straw biochar amendment and ridge-furrow rainwater harvesting systems on run-off, sediment yield and the physico-chemical properties of a Calcic Cambisol soil in semiarid areas. The experiment was conducted on alfalfa (Medicago sativa) production land at the Anjiagou Catchment experimental station in Gansu province, China. The experimental layout was a split-plot design with three replications. Biochar was applied at a rate of 0 and 30 t ha(-1), respectively. The tillage treatments were flat planting, open-ridging, and tied-ridging (TR). Overall, the integration of maize straw biochar with TR decreased soil bulk density at 0-40 cm depth. Biochar application reduced run-off by 37.8% and soil loss by 55.5% during alfalfa-growing seasons compared to the control. In general, biochar addition increased soil total potassium, but the same effect was not observed for soil pH, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and available phosphorus. These findings demonstrate the potential of integrating maize straw biochar and tillage systems to reduce soil erosion and improve soil quality for rainfed crop production in semiarid areas. Further studies on the effect of biochar-tillage system interaction are warranted to improve soil conditions for plant growth and increase crop yield in dryland areas.

Water is provided partly via handpumps, which, as the only improved method of abstraction from sand dams, are important for drinking water security. Accelerometers and cellular transmitters were fitted to 30 handpumps by the Africa Sand Dam Foundation (ASDF) in 2019 to monitor the use and reliability of the handpumps by recording hourly water volume abstracted. Data from April 2019 to October 2021 for 26 of these sites, alongside qualitative data, were analysed and each handpump's contribution to year-round water security was explored, focusing on the long dry season when water supply from other sources is compromised. Abstraction was over 20 times higher in the long dry season than in any other season, and at sites with higher salinity, higher livestock use, and larger dam wall area. At 21 wells, abstraction was still being recorded at the end of at least one long dry season; however, high spatial and temporal heterogeneity between pumps and seasons means that not all sand dams deliver reliable water supply year-round. Quantifying the contribution that sand dams make to water security is crucial for understanding their resilience against a changing climate and can aid decision makers when choosing the most appropriate water management technique. Knowledge of temporal and site heterogeneity in abstraction can inform when other water sources need increasing and can help with sand dam design optimisation. Overall, our results indicate the positive contribution that sand dams make to year-round water security through the water that is abstracted through handpumps.

This study investigated historical (1911-2018) nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from applications of synthetic nitrogen (N) fertiliser for agricultural purposes and crop residues retained in the fields post-harvest in South Africa. The aim was to develop trends of different sources of these emissions to guide national mitigation plans. Disaggregation of the emissions from key crops were developed using area planted, N application rates and residues retained in the fields. N2O intensities were calculated to establish a relationship between agricultural emissions and socio-economic conditions. Total emissions from N and crop residues were 7.3 million tonnes (Mt) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) emissions in 2018 and N2O from N fertiliser was approximately 3.0 Mt. Arrival of subsidised synthetic N in the 1950s grew the emissions significantly until they peaked in the 1980s when the support was terminated. N2O emissions per capita are gradually decreasing with time which indicates an unsustainable situation of population growing faster than its ability to produce food for itself. Less emissions per kilocalorie further indicate that crop emissions are not carbon intensive.

Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) has become an indispensable tool to collect refined spatial and high temporal resolution imagery data. A 2-year field study was conducted in 2018 and 2019 to determine the temporal effects of drought on canopy growth of winter wheat. Weekly UAS data were collected using red, green, and blue (RGB) and multispectral (MS) sensors over a yield trial consisting of 22 winter wheat cultivars in both irrigated and dryland environments. Raw-images were processed to compute canopy features such as canopy cover (CC) and canopy height (CH), and vegetation indices (VIs) such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Excess Green Index (ExG), and Normalized Difference Red-edge Index (NDRE). The drought was more severe in 2018 than in 2019 and the effects of growth differences across years and irrigation levels were visible in the UAS measurements. CC, CH, and VIs, measured during grain filling, were positively correlated with grain yield (r = 0.4-0.7, p < 0.05) in the dryland in both years. Yield was positively correlated with VIs in 2018 (r = 0.45-0.55, p < 0.05) in the irrigated environment, but the correlations were non-significant in 2019 (r = 0.1 to -0.4), except for CH. The study shows that high-throughput UAS data can be used to monitor the drought effects on wheat growth and productivity across the temporal and spatial domains.

In this context, spatial estimation of available runoff potential, planning and adoption of site-specific interventions for in-situ moisture conservation, supplementing irrigation and groundwater recharge are of prime concern. Therefore, spatial runoff estimation models were developed subdistrict-wise for the northern dry zone of Karnataka using the Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) method and GIS. The estimated runoff was validated using the recorded data and was found satisfactory (R-2 = 0.90). The results indicated that for major portion of the study area (61.8%), the mean annual rainfall varied spatially from 550 to 800 mm, and the runoff potential ranged from 10.0% to 20.0% of mean annual rainfall from 1951 to 2013. The higher rainfall and runoff potential was observed in the Khanapur subdistrict which lies in the western part of the selected area. It was observed that the number of subdistricts under the low-rainfall category (<550 mm) has increased, whereas the high-rainfall category (>1100 mm) has decreased over the years. Considerable variation in rainfall and runoff potential was observed during above normal, normal and drought years. The runoff generated from most of the study area was below 10.0% of mean annual rainfall in drought year, <30.0% in above normal year and <15.0% in normal year. The northern dry zone of Karnataka is vulnerable to drought and water scarcity, and the runoff potential was estimated under future scenarios using ENSEMBLE data of CMIP 5 to enable planners to design water-harvesting structures effectively. Finally, based on the modeling results, it was found that by 2050s (2040 to 2069), the runoff potential is expected to increase by 20.0% to 30.0% under RCP 8.5 and by 10.0% to 20.0% under RCP 4.5 and RCP 2.6 scenarios. By 2080s (2070-2099), the runoff is predicted to increase by >30.0% under RCP 8.5, by 20.0% to 30.0% under RCP 4.5 and by 10.0% to 20.0% under RCP 2.6, respectively. Even though considerable increase in runoff potential is predicted for the northern dry zone of Karnataka in the coming years, the current runoff potential itself is relatively high, and there is tremendous scope for its harvesting and utilization for in-situ moisture conservation, supplemental irrigation and groundwater recharge to ensure the long-term sustainability of the region						, Gopinath K.A./0000-0001-5921-292X														2071-1050				APR	2022	14	7							3969	10.3390/su14073969	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14073969													WOS:000781334500001

Due to the climate change-driven aridity ecosystems, deserts provide one of the most hostile environments for microbial life and survival. Therefore, a detailed study was carried out to explore the deserts with different aridity levels (exposed to severe climate change) influence on microbial (bacteria, fungi, and protist) diversity patterns, assembly processes, and co-occurrence. The results revealed that the aridity (semi-arid, arid, and hyper-arid) patterns caused distinct changes in environmental heterogeneity in desert ecosystems. Similarly, microbial diversities were also reduced with increasing the aridity pattern, and it was found that environmental heterogeneity is highly involved in affecting microbial diversities under different ecological niches. Interestingly, it was found that certain microbes, including bacterial (Firmi-cutes), fungal (Sordariomycetes), and protistan (Ciliophora) abundance increased with increasing aridity levels, indicating that these microbes might possess the capability to tolerate the environmental stress conditions. Moreover, microbial community turnover analysis revealed that bacterial diversities followed homogenous selection, whereas fungi and protists were mostly driven by the dispersal limitation pattern. Co-occurrence network analysis showed that hyper-arid and arid conditions tightened the bacterial and fungal communities and had more positive associations compared to protistan. In conclusion, multiple lines of evidence were provided to shed light on the habitat specialization impact on microbial (bacteria, fungi, and protists) communities and composition under different desert ecosystems.

In order to make this region sustainable, estimation of soil loss, selection and prioritization of suitable interventions, and its adoption are very important. In this study, spatial soil loss estimation models were developed sub-district-wise using the Revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) and GIS for a period of 70 years (1951 to 2020). The observed soil loss data for the period of 2011 to 2015 were used for validation of the model (R-2 = 0.89) and were found satisfactory. The average annual rainfall ranged spatially from 420 to 3700 mm, erosivity (R) ranged from 2606 to >15,000 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1) year(-1), and average annual soil loss varied from 15.0 t ha(-1) y(-1) in the northern dry zone of Karnataka. Most of the study area had an average annual rainfall of 550 to 800 mm and the soil loss was <10.0 t ha(-1) y(-1). A higher erosivity and soil loss occurred in the western part of the selected area where high rainfall is predominant. A considerable variability in rainfall, erosivity, and soil loss was found in high, medium, and low-rainfall regions from 1951 to 2020. The spatial soil loss was estimated catchment-wise and prioritized to determine the vulnerable areas. It was found that 7.69% of the area with soil loss >= 15.0 t ha(-1) y(-1) needs top priority for planning interventions (Priority 1) followed by 10.49% of the area with soil loss ranging from 10.0 to 15.0 t ha(-1) y(-1) (Priority 2) and 42.7% of the area under 5.0 to 10.0 t ha(-1) y(-1) (Priority 3), and the remaining area has lower priority. In order to make Northern Karnataka more sustainable, suitable site-specific moisture conservation practices and water-harvesting/groundwater recharge structures were planned using geospatial techniques. Among the selected moisture conservation interventions, conservation furrow and contour cultivation are very suitable for all the nine districts followed by compartmental bunding and semi-circular bunds. Out of the total area, conservation furrow was found suitable for 45.3% of the area, contour cultivation for 24.3% of the area, and compartmental bunding and semi-circular bunds for 16.8 and 16.9% of the areas, respectively. The study indicated that a considerable amount of topsoil is lost as erosion and, hence, planning and adoption of suitable in situ soil and water conservation practices and water-harvesting/groundwater recharge structures are the need of the hour for the sustainable management of this region. The identified locations were validated using visual interpretations, ground truth, and recorded data.																				2073-4441				NOV	2022	14	22							3623	10.3390/w14223623	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14223623													WOS:000887774500001

Impacts of climate change on groundwater recharge in Wyoming big sagebrush ecosystems are contingent on elevation	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Water is the most limiting and important natural resource in drylands, where low precipitation, high evaporative demand, and drought events are common. Groundwater is the critical resource for human livelihoods to persist through the intra-annual dry periods in dryland ecosystems. Overexploitation of groundwater resources and the externalities associated with depleted aquifers make understanding the ecohydrology of drylands an essential issue. We focus on the water balance and climatic drivers of big sagebrush ecosystems, an important dryland ecosystem type in Wyoming that covers a large spatial extent. The goal of this project was to understand how groundwater recharge (GWR) may change in magnitude and seasonality across multiple sites in Wyoming in the future. We used a combination of fieldwork and simulation modeling to explore key climatic and ecohydrological drivers of GWR. We simulated soil water balance using SOILWAT2, a process-based ecosystem-scale soil water model, and future climate data to estimate change in GWR through 2100. We found that mean annual temperature and precipitation explained 65% of the variation in future change in GWR. High-elevation (> 2200 m) wet sites had larger increases in GWR in the future compared to low-elevation dry sites. The among-site variability in GWR was also higher for sites > 2200 m, which indicates that mean annual precipitation and perhaps snowpack are important explanatory variables for GWR. Our research suggests that GWR for high-elevation big sagebrush sites may increase in magnitude from current values and may occur earlier in the year, with important implications for the timing and availability of water resources.

Regrettably, a range of human activities such as cattle grazing, off-road driving, hiking, and global warming result in significant deterioration of biocrust cover and their associated services. This scenario has prompted efforts to develop effective biocrust restoration strategies, which often involve the production of biocrust inoculum, both in greenhouse and in laboratory settings. Sometimes this inoculum is preconditioned in a process of "hardening" at considerable expense and effort in order to improve its fitness under harsh field conditions. But the positive effects of such hardening procedures have yet to be rigorously demonstrated. Here, we compared the growth performance of 20 cultured strains of biocrust cyanobacteria in outdoor tests on native soils as a function of preconditioning regimes consisting of increasingly high exposure to solar radiation, temperature and illumination daily variability, and recurrent wet-dry cycles. Preconditioning improved performance in 13 out of 20 strains, particularly among pioneer crust-forming Microcoleus spp. (eight out of eight). Improvements were variable among heterocystous strains (three out of four Scytonema spp., two out of four Tolypothrix spp., and none out of four Nostoc spp.). Based on these results, we recommend the inclusion of preconditioning treatments to increase inoculum survival rate and speed of cyanobacterial biocrust recovery in restoration of dryland soils.

Present investigation deals with the estimation of metabolites and anti-oxidative enzyme activities in four inbred maize lines; NSJ221, NSJ189, PSRJ13099 and RJR270 in response to high temperature stress imposed at reproductive stage by staggered sowing. An increase in H2O2 and malondialdehyde (MDA) was observed in all the genotypes, however the increase was higher in PSRJ13099 and RJR270. The activities of studied enzymes increased in NSJ189 and NSJ221 while a decrease was observed in PSRJ13099 and RJR270. Under heat stress isoforms of SOD increased in NSJ189 and NSJ221 while a concomitant decrease was observed in PSRJ13099 and RJR270. Two new SOD-isoforms were also observed in NSJ221. GPX showed more number of high mobility isoforms with low activity in NSJ221 and less mobile isoforms with higher activity in both NSJ189 and NSJ221. Whereas, PSRJ13099 and RJR270 showed decrease band intensity of less mobile GPX-isoforms under heat stress. Activity of CAT-isoforms increased to a similar extent across the genotypes under heat stress. In case of non-enzymatic antioxidants, non-protein thiols increased in all the genotypes while the level of carotenoids depleted in all the genotypes except NSJ221. Ascorbate (AsA) levels depleted in PSRJ13099 and RJR270 and increased in NSJ189 and NSJ221 under heat stress. Understanding the intricate regulatory pathways in crop plants under heat stress will help in developing genotypes with enhanced stress tolerance.

JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Although a recovery of woody vegetation has been observed throughout the Sahel, western Niger has not followed the overall satellite-derived greening trend. While satellite imagery can be used to study overall patterns and trends, only field observations can provide insights in the dynamics of woody plant populations. Here we used field data from 29 sites in the Dantiandou district in Niger to study woody species composition, plant density, crown cover, basal area, foliage and wood mass from 1996 to 2017. All sites show a decrease in woody plant parameters with a faster decrease in rangeland than in agricultural land. Most of the decrease is due to the loss of shrubs, while trees do not change significantly. When field observations were scaled up to the district level using land use maps, shrub density decreased from 342 to 155 ha-1 in agricultural land, and from 1567 to 250 ha-1 in rangeland. Trends in annual rainfall and soil moisture during the study period were not significant and cannot explain the decrease of woody vegetation. Instead, the expansion of cropped areas, shortened crop-fallow cycles and increasing pressure on wood resources to satisfy demand for fuel and construction materials may have contributed to the decline.

However, the effects of grazing on soil cellulolytic fungi, an important indicator of the degradation process for soil organic matter, remain less well understood. Using T-RFLP and sequencing methods, we investigated the effects of grazing on the temporal changes of cellulolytic fungal abundance and community structure in dry steppe soils during the growing months from May to September, on the Tibetan Plateau using T-RFLP and sequencing methods. The results demonstrated that the abundance of soil cellulolytic fungi under grazing treatment changed significantly from month to month, and was positively correlated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and soil temperature, but negatively correlated with soil pH. Contrastingly, cellulolytic fungal abundance did not change within the fencing treatment (ungrazed conditions). Cellulolytic fungal community structure changed significantly in the growing months in grazed soils, but did not change in fenced soils. Grazing played a key role in determining the community structure of soil cellulolytic fungi by explaining 8.1% of the variation, while pH and DOC explained 4.1% and 4.0%, respectively. Phylogenetically, the cellulolytic fungi were primarily affiliated with Ascomycota (69.65% in relative abundance) and Basidiomycota (30.35%). Therefore, grazing substantially reduced the stability of soil cellulolytic fungal abundance and community structure, as compared with the fencing treatment. Our finding provides a new insight into the responses of organic matter-decomposing microbes for grassland managements.

J	Prince, SD; Jackson, H				Prince, Stephen D.; Jackson, Hasan			Unplanned Natural Experiments: The Case of Remote Sensing of Primary Production and Its Environmental Correlations in the Negev	REMOTE SENSING												Studies of the correlations of environmental factors with vegetation growth using remotely sensed measurements are necessarily made against a background of biophysical and anthropogenic factors, such as local fertility, microclimate, and the effects of human land use, in addition to the factors of interest. This is an inevitable outcome of a natural (unplanned) design where the effects of the factors of interest are confounded with other, often unknown factors, possibly rendering the results inaccurate or poorly-constrained. The problems associated with a natural design would be reduced if sites could be identified in which uncontrolled variables had no impact. However, rarely are such sites known a priori. Here, a component of the net primary production (NPP) local scaling (LNS) method was used to estimate the potential NPP in the absence of confounding factors. Subsequent analyses of the effects of the selected environmental variables were carried out using the potential NPP. The method was tested in relation to NPP along the transitional ecotone from desert to semiarid conditions in the northern Negev, Israel. The effects of four environmental factors were tested: precipitation, topography, land cover, and interannual variability. While precipitation is generally the only environmental variable that is considered in drylands, the other factors were found to be significant. The results provided unambiguous evidence of the value of the method.

Establishing how desert vegetation responds to changes in both natural forcing and anthropogenic interference is essential for better understanding desertification processes and their future dynamics. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of NDVI time series data in combination with climate reanalysis data and topographic data was conducted to investigate the possible effects of different external factors on desert vegetation in the Tengger desert, one of the largest deserts in northern China. The results show that vegetation is mostly distributed near the desert margins and in the interdune areas with relatively low and flat topography. Multiple NDVI datasets indicate a consistently greening trend over the entire desert during the last forty years, and the greening rates are higher at sites with sand fixation and vegetation restoration practices. After a few decades of restoration practices, vegetation greenness in these sites is approaching their natural states, but they still show large interannual variability associated with precipitation fluctuations. Therefore, the greening trend of the entire desert could be related to recent climate change towards wetter, warmer and less windy conditions, while human efforts have accelerated the rate of vegetation recovery in the restoration sites. Our study implies that the present climate change has produced conditions favorable for continued vegetation increase in the drylands of northern China, and this trend has been facilitated by policy-driven restoration projects. The combined effects of climate change, topography and human interference on desert vegetation should be considered in future restoration practices.

Resurrection of the African gecko genus Ancylodactylus Muller, 1907 (Squamata: Gekkonidae) and description of six new species from Kenya	ZOOTAXA												The genus Cnemaspis as presently construed is polyphyletic, with African, South Asian and Southeast Asian clades each representing independent lineages. The name Ancylodactylus M??ller, 1907 is available for the African clade of forest geckos and features previously identified as putatively diagnostic of this group (loss or reduction of the second phalanx of digit IV of manus and pes, as well as a markedly dilated basal portions of the digits) are here regarded as characters supporting the monophyly of Ancylodactylus. Six new species of Ancylodactylus are described: A. kenyaensis sp. nov., A. kituiensis sp. nov., A. mathewsensis sp. nov., A. laikipiensis sp. nov., A. spawlsi sp. nov., and A. chyuluensis sp. nov. on the basis of unique combinations of body size, trunk and tail tubercles, median subcaudal scales, precloacal pores, enlarged subdigital plates, ventral color, and throat color and patterning. Ancylodactylus kenyaensis is among the largest members of the genus, reaching 65 mm SVL, whereas A. spawlsi and A. chyuluensis, with maximum SVLs of 30 mm or less, are the smallest of all members of the genus. All these geckos are chiefly scansorial, occurring on tree trunks, fallen logs and/or in rock outcrops. Ancylodactylus kituiensis and A. mathewsensis occur in isolated dryland hilltop forests surrounded by large tracts of arid lands and are locally abundant in suitable rock outcrops or caves, where they occur in small colonies. Ancylodactylus kenyaensis is a montane forest species found on tree trunks with cracks and crevices, whereas A. spawlsi is a montane forest species found in crevices and beneath loose bark of tree trunks as well as in rock crevices and slabs. Ancylodactylus laikipiensis is likewise both rupicolous and arboreal and A. chyuluensis has been taken only from a pitfall trap in a dry forest patch. All the new species are endemic to relatively small, circumscribed areas within Kenya and all occur within protected areas. At present we consider their IUCN conservation status to be Data Deficient. Herpetological surveys are recommended in other unexplored or under-explored forest areas, particularly hilltop montane forests in isolated dryland rocky hills as these may harbor other undescribed Ancylodactylus species or previously undocumented populations of known species.

Drylands will likely experience lower and more unreliable rainfall as climatic conditions change over the next century. Dryland soils support a rich community of microphytic organisms (biocrusts), which are critically important because they regulate the delivery and retention of water. Yet despite their hydrological significance, a global synthesis of their effects on hydrology is lacking. We synthesized 2,997 observations from 109 publications to explore how biocrusts affected five hydrological processes (times to ponding and runoff, early [sorptivity] and final [infiltration] stages of water flow into soil, and the rate or volume of runoff) and two hydrological outcomes (moisture storage, sediment production). We found that increasing biocrust cover reduced the time for water to pond on the surface (-40%) and commence runoff (-33%), and reduced infiltration (-34%) and sediment production (-68%). Greater biocrust cover had no significant effect on sorptivity or runoff rate/amount, but increased moisture storage (+14%). Infiltration declined most (-56%) at fine scales, and moisture storage was greatest (+36%) at large scales. Effects of biocrust type (cyanobacteria, lichen, moss, mixed), soil texture (sand, loam, clay), and climatic zone (arid, semiarid, dry subhumid) were nuanced. Our synthesis provides novel insights into the magnitude, processes, and contexts of biocrust effects in drylands. This information is critical to improve our capacity to manage dwindling dryland water supplies as Earth becomes hotter and drier.

In this paper, five dryland winter wheat cultivars representative of widely cultivated varieties released from the 1940s to the 2010s in Shaanxi Province, China, were grown in an open rainout shelter (which could be closed when rain threatened) under four contrasting water/N treatment combinations. Yield-related parameters, biomass accumulation, crop water productivity (WUE), and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) were determined. The results indicated that water deficit and low N treatment caused a significant reduction in grain yield and flag leaf photosynthesis in the five wheat cultivars studied. However, NUE, grain protein content, and partial factor nitrogen productivity were significantly improved by N application under water deficit. Our results confirm the genetic improvement for plant growth, N accumulation, and grain yield in wheat cultivars released from the 1940s to the 2010s; newergenotypes showed the highest NUE under water deficit combined with N limited conditions. Additionally, based on principal component analysis, we found that the newer genotypes, i.e. those from the 2000s and the 2010s, are more sensitive to low nitrogen and water stress compared with the older genotypes from the 1980s, which are more sensitive to the combined effect of water and N limitations. Our findings provide a theoretical support for further improvement of the wheat yield potential, selection, and breeding of high-efficiency varieties in arid and semi-arid areas.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				OCT 1	2020	240								106308	10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106308	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106308													WOS:000546646400040

Optimizing agronomic practices for hard winter wheat production in the Great Plains with respect to seeding rate, row spacing, and variety	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield in dryland areas is optimized by the improvement of genetics in combination with ideal production practices. Different combinations of seeding rate and row spacing can influence the development of wheat plants, impacting wheat yield and its components. To determine the influence of these practices, yield components, water use efficiency (WUE), biomass, and subsequent grain yield were evaluated in an experiment conducted at the High Plains Agricultural Laboratory, Sidney, NE, from 2019 until 2022, using a split-plot randomized complete block design with four replications. Treatments consisted of four different row spacings (19, 25, 31, and 51 cm), three seeding rates (1.05, 2.1, and 3.1 million seeds ha(-1)), and two high performing winter wheat varieties-'Ruth' and 'Robidoux'. Row spacing showed differences in wheat yield (p < 0.0001) across all years, with a significant effect of seeding rate only in 1 year and an interaction effect of the three factors in 2022 alone. Higher wheat yield was achieved with the two narrower row spacings (19 and 25 cm) compared to the wider row spacings of 38 and 51 cm. The treatment combining the 19 cm row spacing and either 2.1 or 3.1 million seed ha(-1) seeding rate had the greatest yields in most years. Narrower row spacings had improved WUE in drier years as compared to wider row spacings.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi improve nutrient status of <i>Commiphora myrrha</i> seedlings under drought	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												In dryland ecosystems, tree and shrub seedling establishment, growth and survival are limited by access to water and nutrients. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) increase seedling establishment and survival by enhancing nutrient and water acquisition. We executed a fully-factorial greenhouse experiment to determine the interactive effect of AMF (with and without), water deficit (four levels), and soil layer (topsoil and subsoil) on the biomass, growth, nutrient concentrations, and mycorrhizal root colonization of seedlings of Commiphora myrrha, a tree species that dominates large areas of dry forest and woodland in the Horn of Africa. Mycorrhizal seedlings had higher root and shoot biomass than non-mycorrhizal seedlings. They also had higher nutrient concentrations in root and shoot. Plant biomass was higher when plants were grown in topsoil at lower soil moisture levels. Mycorrhizal responsiveness was highest at lower soil moisture. The drought response index was higher for mycorrhizal than for non-mycorrhizal plants, indicating enhanced mycorrhizal benefits at lower water supply. Seedlings grew better in topsoil than in subsoil. Mycorrhizal colonization of roots of C. myrrha seedlings was higher with lower moisture and higher in topsoil than in subsoil. The increased performance of mycorrhizal C. myrrha indicates that mycorrhization is a major component of the adaptive strategy of seedlings of this species, similar to other species in these dryland deciduous ecosystems. We conclude that for restoration purposes with this species, nursery seedlings should be mycorrhized because of their enhanced growth performance.					birhane, emiru/JBJ-0779-2023	birhane, emiru/0000-0002-8644-5961; Norgrove, Lindsey/0000-0003-2481-5880													0140-1963	1095-922X				FEB	2023	209								104877	10.1016/j.jaridenv.2022.104877	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2022.104877		NOV 2022											WOS:000927625800001
J	Yao, S; Bian, YR; Jiang, X; Song, Y				Yao, Shi; Bian, Yongrong; Jiang, Xin; Song, Yang			Characterization of dissolved organic matter distribution in forestland and farmland of mollisol based on untargeted metabolomics	SOIL ECOLOGY LETTERS												Characterization of mollisol soil DOM by untargeted metabolomics is possible.. The polarity of the extractants determines the polarity of the extracted DOM.. Land use patterns affect the biological functions and co-network interaction of DOM. Mollisol soil is a major contributor to food production. Clarification of the molecular characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) will contribute to the overall understanding and management of mollisol soil. However, the complexity of DOM poses a challenge to understanding its molecular characteristics. In this study, we investigated the molecular characteristics of DOM (< 1 000 Da) in mollisol soils with different soil use patterns (forestland and dryland) based on untargeted metabolomics. Here, we confirmed the feasibility of untargeted metabolomics for the molecular characterization of DOM in mollisol soils. DOM in forestland is mainly derived from plant metabolites, and DOM can perform more biological functions. However, DOM in dryland has complex composition and has powerful co-occurrence network interactions due to human activities. Water has better extraction efficiency for polar DOM, while organic reagents can efficiently extract lipid-like DOM, but the polarity of the extractant has less influence on the DOM than the soil physicochemical properties. Meanwhile, 14-dihydroxyzeatin screened based on metabolomics can be used as a potential indicator for corn land. Therefore, untargeted metabolomics can be an effective method to characterize the DOM molecules of mollisol soil, which provides new insights for management of mollisol soil and sustainable agricultural development.																			2662-2289	2662-2297				DEC	2023	5	4							230179	10.1007/s42832-023-0179-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42832-023-0179-1													WOS:001018406600001

Thermal time requirements for germination of four subterranean clover cultivars	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												In vitro germination tests were performed at 11 constant temperatures (range 2.5-35 degrees C) to quantify the maximum germination percentage and germination rate of four subterranean clover cultivars ('Antas', 'Denmark', 'Monti' and 'Narrikup'). These were used to estimate their cardinal temperatures, base (T-b), optimum (T-opt) and maximum (T-max) and the thermal time requirements for seed germination. Germination percentages were >= 88% in the 5-25 degrees C temperature range for all cultivars. The time to reach 50% of final germination (T-50) decreased from 12 to 2 days as the temperature increased from 2.5 to 17.5 degrees C. The determined T-opt were 16 degrees C for 'Monti' and 'Narrikup' and 22 degrees C for 'Antas' and 'Denmark'. At a common T-b of 0 degrees C the thermal time requirements for T-50 were 32 +/- 1 degrees Cd for 'Antas' and 'Denmark' and 39 +/- 1 degrees Cd for 'Narrikup' and 'Monti'. 'Antas' and 'Denmark' (both from Italy) germinated at the widest range of temperatures.

Global observational coverage of onshore oil and gas methane sources with TROPOMI	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Satellite observations have been used to measure methane (CH4) emissions from the oil and gas (O&G) industry, particularly by revealing previously undocumented, very large emission events and basin-level emission estimates. However, most satellite systems use passive remote sensing to retrieve CH4 mixing ratios, which is sensitive to sunlight, earth surface properties, and atmospheric conditions. Accordingly, the reliability of satellites for routine CH4 emissions monitoring varies across the globe. To better understand the potentials and limitations of routine monitoring of CH4 emissions with satellites, we investigated the global observational coverage of the TROPOMI instrument onboard the Sentinel-5P satellite-the only satellite system currently with daily global coverage. A 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees gridded global map that indicates the average number of days with valid observations from TROPOMI for 2019-2021 was generated by following the measurement retrieval quality-assurance threshold (>= 0.5). We found TROPOMI had promising observational coverage over dryland regions (maximum: 58.6%) but limited coverage over tropical regions and high latitudes (minimum: 0%). Cloud cover and solar zenith angle were the primary factors affecting observational coverage at high latitudes, while aerosol optical thickness was the primary factor over dryland regions. To further assess the country-level reliability of satellites for detecting and quantifying CH4 emissions from the onshore O&G sector, we extracted the average annual TROPOMI observational coverage (TOC) over onshore O&G infrastructure for 160 countries. Seven of the top-10 O&G-producing countries had an average annual TOC<10% (<36 days per year), which indicates the limited ability to routinely identify large emissions events, track their duration, and quantify emissions rates using inverse modelling. We further assessed the potential performance of the latter by combining TOC and the uncertainties from the global O&G inventory. Results indicate that the accuracy of emissions quantifications of onshore O&G sources using TROPOMI data and inverse modeling will be higher in countries located in dryland and mid-latitude regions and lower in tropical and high-latitude regions. Therefore, current passive-sensing satellites have low potential for frequent monitoring of large methane emissions from O&G sectors in countries located in tropical and high latitudes (e.g., Canada, Russia, Brazil, Norway, and Venezuela). Alternative methods should be considered for routine emissions monitoring in these regions.

Agro-climatic onset of cropping season: A tool for determining optimum date of sowing in dry zones of southern Karnataka	JOURNAL OF AGROMETEOROLOGY												The study was conducted to analyse the rainfall pattern of dry farming zones of Southern Karnataka to arrive at proper date of sowing by considering parameters like threshold rainfall (20 mm), threshold dry day (2.5 mm) and threshold dry spell period (10 days) as a main defining parameters for decision making in sowing of major crops (finger millet, pigeonpea, groundnut, etc.). In all the three zones, the agro-climatic onset of cropping season was earlier as compared to meteorological onset (June 1st week) due to bimodal distribution of rainfall having its peaks in May and September month. In Central Dry Zone, Southern Dry Zone and Eastern Dry Zone, fourteenth June, thirteenth June and twenty-third May were the agro-climatic onset dates (average of all stations in each zone), respectively. Station wise analysis of the rainfall revealed different agro-climatic onset dates. Ninth May in central dry zone, eighth May in eastern dry zone and fifth May in southern dry zone were the earliest onset dates. These variations in between zonal and station specific onset dates were due to spatio-temporal variations in rainfall. Therefore, advancements in sowing of crops based on the agro-climatic onset should be taken into account for betterment of crop production.

Climate-driven ecological thresholds in China's drylands modulated by grazing	NATURE SUSTAINABILITY												Degradation of ecosystems can occur when certain ecological thresholds are passed below which ecosystem responses remain within 'safe ecological limits'. Ecosystems such as drylands are sensitive to both aridification and grazing, but the combined effects of such factors on the emergence of ecological thresholds beyond which ecosystem degradation occurs has yet to be quantitatively evaluated. This limits our understanding on 'safe operating spaces' for grazing, the main land use in drylands worldwide. Here we assessed how 20 structural and functional ecosystem attributes respond to joint changes in aridity and grazing pressure across China & PRIME;s drylands. Gradual increases in aridity resulted in abrupt decreases in productivity, soil fertility and plant richness. Rising grazing pressures lowered such aridity thresholds for most ecosystem variables, thus showing how ecological thresholds can be amplified by the joint effects of these two factors. We found that 44.4% of China's drylands are unsuitable for grazing due to climate change-induced aridification, a percentage that may increase to 50.8% by 2100. Of current dryland grazing areas, 8.9% exceeded their maximum allowable grazing pressure. Our findings provide important insights into the relationship between aridity and optimal grazing pressure and identify safe operating spaces for grazing across China's drylands. Understanding the synergistic effects of aridity and grazing on dryland ecosystem attributes can be important for identifying 'safe operating spaces' for grazing under an increasingly arid climate. This study uses two-dimensional ecological threshold models to assess this in China's drylands.

J	Rohde, MM; Stella, JC; Roberts, DA; Singer, MB				Rohde, Melissa M.; Stella, John C.; Roberts, Dar A.; Singer, Michael Bliss			Groundwater dependence of riparian woodlands and the disrupting effect of anthropogenically altered streamflow	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Riparian ecosystems fundamentally depend on groundwater, especially in dryland regions, yet their water requirements and sources are rarely considered in water resource management decisions. Until recently, technological limitations and data gaps have hindered assessment of groundwater influences on riparian ecosystem health at the spatial and temporal scales relevant to policy and management. Here, we analyze Sentinel-2-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; n = 5,335,472 observations), field-based groundwater elevation (n = 32,051 observations), and streamflow alteration data for riparian woodland communities (n = 22,153 polygons) over a 5-y period (2015 to 2020) across California. We find that riparian woodlands exhibit a stress response to deeper groundwater, as evidenced by concurrent declines in greenness represented by NDVI. Furthermore, we find greater seasonal coupling of canopy greenness to groundwater for vegetation along streams with natural flow regimes in comparison with anthropogenically altered streams, particularly in the most water-limited regions. These patterns suggest that many riparian woodlands in California are subsidized by water management practices. Riparian woodland communities rely on naturally variable groundwater and streamflow components to sustain key ecological processes, such as recruitment and succession. Altered flow regimes, which stabilize streamflow throughout the year and artificially enhance water supplies to riparian vegetation in the dry season, disrupt the seasonal cycles of abiotic drivers to which these Mediterranean forests are adapted. Consequently, our analysis suggests that many riparian ecosystems have become reliant on anthropogenically altered flow regimes, making them more vulnerable and less resilient to rapid hydrologic change, potentially leading to future riparian forest loss across increasingly stressed dryland regions.

Soil surface disturbance from a broad range of natural and human processes (e.g. fire, livestock grazing, off-road traffic) cause significant losses in biocrust cover and associated ecosystems services. Hence, biocrust restoration is emerging as an important intervention strategy to rehabilitate degraded dryland soils. In a multistep process, we designed protocols for the establishment of "microbial nurseries" to produce photosynthetic cyanobacterial inoculum for biocrust seeding at scale. We first report on the strategy for isolation, directly from the target site, of a large culture collection of cyanobacteria that included multiple representatives of the five most common biocrust taxa. After genetic pedigreeing of these isolates, we could select those that best matched field populations genetically for scale-up cultivation. We then developed protocols for effective cyanobacterial biomass production to obtain sufficient inoculum. This was followed by conditioning treatments (hardening off) to preacclimate this inoculum to the stressful conditions expected in the field. Finally, we show that the inoculum obtained was fit to thrive in its original soil under natural outdoor conditions if sufficient water was available. We repeated this process successfully for four sites, two in the hot Chihuanuan desert and two in the cooler Great Basin Desert, and on two textural types of soils in each. The cyanobacterial biocrust nursery approach represents a versatile, viable, and safe tool for the rehabilitation of dryland soils.

How N fertilizer management practices influence soil CO(2)emission rates under different crop rotations remains unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the impact on soil CO(2)emission and soil physicochemical properties of three N fertilizer treatments including traditional rate (TF), optimized rate (0.8TF), and no fertilizer (NF) under three different crop rotation treatments: wheat-fallow (WF), wheat-soybean (WS), and wheat-maize (WM) over two years in a field experiment in northwest China. The rates were 5.51, 5.60, and 5.97 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)of mean soil CO(2)emission under the TF, 0.8TF, and NF treatments, respectively. Mean soil CO(2)emission rates were 21.33 and 26.99% higher under the WM rotation compared with the WF and WS rotations, respectively. The WS rotation showed higher soil nutrient content and lower soil CO(2)emissions, and reduced fertilizer application. Importantly, soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration in the topsoil can be maximized by including either a summer legume or a summer maize crop in winter wheat rotations, and by applying N fertilizer at the optimal rate. This may be particularly beneficial in the dryland cropping systems of northern China.

J	Chen, N; Zhang, YF; Zhao, CM				Chen, Ning; Zhang, Yafeng; Zhao, Changming			On the importance of stemflow to the woody plants in drylands: Individual vs. ecosystem scales	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Stemflow has long been recognized as an important ecohydrological process in drylands, and may influence dynamics of woody plants by altering rainfall redistribution. However, quantification of the effects of stemflow on woody plants dynamics remains largely unclear. It is also unknown whether the effects of stemflow are consistent for individual plants and ecosystems where woody plants grow. This study developed an ecohydrological model to explore how stemflow affected individual woody plants and ecosystems, and how the effects changed along a rainfall gradient (10-600 mm) in a dryland ecosystem. This study demonstrated the positive effects of stemflow on woody plants in both individual (by a degree of 16-48%) and ecosystem scales (by a degree of 8-45%). Stemflow started to promote woody plant growth in the individual scale even when annual rainfall was very low (<50 mm), whereas stemflow did not exert strong influences for the whole ecosystems until annual precipitation was higher than 130 mm. However, the effects of stemflow in ecosystem scale might surpass the counterpart in individual scale under some ranges of annual rainfall. Namely, the effects of stemflow in individual and ecosystem scales mismatched. The positive feedback between woody cover and stemflow may cause the unequal effects of stemflow for individual plants and ecosystems. Overall, this study quantified how stemflow affected woody plants in individual and ecosystem scales, which may contribute to dryland restorations by assisting vegetation configuration and being integrated into dynamic global vegetation model.					zhang, yafeng/E-2478-2011	Zhang, Yafeng/0000-0002-5654-6673													0022-1694	1879-2707				OCT	2021	601								126591	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126591	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126591		JUL 2021											WOS:000695816300013
J	Zeng, QC; Liu, D; An, SS				Zeng, Quanchao; Liu, Dong; An, Shaoshan			Decoupled diversity patterns in microbial geographic distributions on the arid area (the Loess Plateau)	CATENA												Soil microbes are essential to biogeochemical cycling, soil organic matter decomposition and climate regulation in terrestrial ecosystems. The biogeography of soil bacteria and fungi lags behind in animals and plants, especially in arid areas with alkaline conditions. Understanding the biogeographic of soil microbes and the interactions with environmental factors will provide new insights into the ecosystem functions and services droved by soil bacteria and fungi. Therefore, we chose 48 dryland sites from two transects (north-south and east-west transects) on the Loess Plateau (an arid area) to determine soil bacterial and fungal diversity and community compositions in response to environmental factors and geographic distance. The results showed that soil organic carbon enhanced soil fungal diversity rather than soil bacterial diversity, while soil bacterial diversity was not affected by the environmental factors on the Loess Plateau. The significant associations between the abundance of main bacteria and fungi and soil pH, suggesting that soil pH was the predominant factor affecting soil microbial community structure. In the alkaline soils (pH = 7.4-9.1), soil bacterial community compositions were limited by soil pH, while soil fungal community composition was less sensitive in response to the alterations in soil pH, revealing soil fungi has a wider optimal pH range than bacteria. Compered to historical contingencies, local environment mainly controlled the geography of bacteria and fungi in soils. On the Loess Plateau, soil microbial communities diverge most by soil pH, especially for soil bacteria. These results provide a well understanding of soil microbial geography and associated biogeochemical cycling in arid areas with higher soil pH.						quanchao, zeng/0000-0003-1272-0227													0341-8162	1872-6887				JAN	2021	196								104922	10.1016/j.catena.2020.104922	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.104922													WOS:000583955200071

The trial was conducted in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Each family, consisting of nine trees per replication, was planted at a spacing of 3 m 9 3 m. Yield stability was analyzed using (1) Eberhart and Russel's regression coefficient (bi) and deviation from regression (S2d), (2) Wrike's ecovalence (Wi); (3) Shukla stability variance (r2i); and (4) Piepho and Lotito's stability index (Li). Families were also analyzed for adaptability and stability using AMMI and GGE biplots graphical methods. The study revealed significant variances due to family and family 9 year interaction for pod and seed yield. Families performed differently and ranked differently across years. The performance of families was influenced by both genetic factor and environmental conditions in different years. Among families tested, TNMP20, Acc14, TNMP14 and Acc30 were high yielders for pods, and Acc14, Acc30, TNMP6, RAK19 and TNMP14 were high for seed yield. According to the Eberhart and Russell model, Acc30, TNMP14 and TNMP3 were stable across years. In the graphical view of family 9 year interaction based on AMMI methods, TNMP3, TNMP4 and TNMP14 had greater stability with moderate seed yield, and Acc14 and Acc30 had moderate stability with high seed yield. On the other hand, GGE biplots revealed Acc14, Acc30 and TNMP14 as high yielders with moderate stability. AMMI and GGE biplots were able to capture nonlinear parts of the family 9 year interaction that were not be captured by the Eberhart and Russel model while also identifying stable families. Based on different methodologies, Acc14, Acc30 and TNMP14 were identified as high yielding and stable families for promoting pongamia cultivation as a biofuel crop for semi-arid regions.																			1007-662X	1993-0607				AUG	2020	31	4					1333	1346		10.1007/s11676-019-00943-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-019-00943-8													WOS:000542370400023

In water-limited ecosystems, the impacts of non-native invasive trees on the water balance are particularly relevant since they can compromise the use of water by native taxa of the ecosystem and water provision for humans. In this paper, we assessed the hydrological impacts of the Ligustrum lucidum (Chinese glossy privet) invasion on a mountain seasonally dry forest of the Chaco region (Central Argentina). More specifically, we determined volumetric soil water content, runoff, and actual evapotranspiration, and their relations to the size of rainfall events in native forest stands and its adjacent invaded stands. We combined three-years field measurements and remote sensing data. L. lucidum stands showed less water content through the soil profiles than the native forest (0-70 cm depth; 19.6 and 23.1 %, respectively), particularly during the dry conditions. The drier condition in the deeper soil layers compared to the upper ones in the invaded stands indicated less rainwater percolation throughout the soil profile over the year, independently of the magnitude of the rainfall events. Daily variation of deep-water content (60-70 cm depth), only observed in L. lucidum stands, showed nightly increase and day-time decrease in dry conditions. Runoff was similar and almost nil in both native and invaded forests, even after large rainfall events (>30 mm). L. lucidum stands showed similar to 18% higher annual actual evapotranspiration rates than native stands. Based on our results, relatively higher water consumption for mono-specific L. lucidum stands in periods when photosynthetic activity of multi-specific native dry forest is still low may represent a competitive advantage in terms of plant invasion, and at the same time it generates negative impacts on water resources, reducing soil water content and limiting deep-water recharge in a water-limited ecosystem.																			0378-1127	1872-7042				DEC 1	2023	549								121493	10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121493	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121493													WOS:001101386900001

Although several metrics have been used to statistically group or compare streamflow characteristics, there is currently no widely used definition of how many days or over what reach length surface flow must cease in order to classify a river as non-perennial. At the same time, the breadth of climate and geographic settings for non-perennial rivers leads to diversity in their flow regimes, such as how often or how quickly they go dry. These rivers have a rich and expanding body of literature addressing their ecologic and geomorphic features, but are often said to be ignored by hydrologists. Yet there is much we do know about their hydrology in terms of streamflow generation processes, water losses, and variability in flow. We also know that while they are prevalent in arid regions, they occur across all climate types and experience a diverse set of natural and anthropogenic controls on streamflow. Furthermore, measuring and modeling the hydrology of these rivers presents a distinct set of challenges, and there are many research directions, which still require further attention. Therefore, we present an overview of the current understanding, methodologic challenges, knowledge gaps, and research directions for hydrologic understanding of non-perennial rivers; critical topics in light of both growing global water scarcity and ever-changing laws and policies that dictate whether and how much environmental protection these rivers receive.

J	Lal, R				Lal, Rattan			Carbon Cycling in Global Drylands	CURRENT CLIMATE CHANGE REPORTS												Purpose of Review The aim of this paper is to describe the carbon cycle in drylands in relation to the processes, factors, and causes affecting it. A specific focus is placed on both biotic and abiotic mechanisms of carbon sequestration in drylands in relation to mitigation of the anthropogenic climate change. Recent Findings Global dryland area is increasing along with an increase in risks of desertification, salinization, and eolian/hydrologic processes of accelerated soil erosion with strong impacts on the carbon cycle. Nonetheless, drylands contribute strongly towards the land-based sink of the atmospheric carbon dioxide through sequestration of carbon in the soil, ground water, and biomass. Thus, dryland ecosystems affect inter-annual variability in the global carbon cycle and create a negative feedback through carbon sequestration. Summary Global drylands, covering 66.7 M km(2) or 45.36% of the Earth's land area, strongly impact the ecosystem carbon stock, contribute to the land-based carbon sink, and provide a negative feedback to the global carbon cycle. Whereas the net primary productivity is limited by the water scarcity, especially in hyper-arid and arid ecoregions, sequestration of inorganic carbon in soil and ground water is an important control of the carbon cycle. Desertification, caused by eolian and hydrologic erosion along with salinization, must be controlled and reversed to enhance carbon sequestration, achieve land degradation neutrality, and create a negative feedback. Carbon sequestration strategy recognizes "soil" as a rights holder to be protected,restored and naturally evolve.

Advances in describing alpha-level taxonomy are needed to understand what drives their abundance and distribution. We describe Trichotorquatus gen. nov. (Oculatellaceae, Synechococcales, Cyanobacteria) based on four new species isolated from dryland soils including the coastal sage scrub near San Diego, California (USA), the Mojave and Colorado Deserts with sites at Joshua Tree National Park and Mojave National Preserve, California (USA), and the Atacama Desert (Chile). The genus is morphologically characterized by having thin trichomes (<4.5 mu m wide), cells both shorter and longer than wide, rarely occurring single and double false branching, necridia appearing singly or in rows, and sheaths with a distinctive collar-like fraying and widening mid-filament, the feature for which the genus is named. The genus is morphologically nearly identical with Leptolyngbya sensu stricto but is phylogenetically quite distant from that genus. It is consequently a cryptic genus that will likely be differentiated in future studies based on 16S rRNA sequence data. The type species, T. maritimus sp. nov. is morphologically distinct from the other three species, T. coquimbo sp. nov., T. andrei sp. nov. and T. ladouxae sp. nov. However, these latter three species are morphologically very close and are considered by the authors to be cryptic species. All species are separated phylogenetically based on sequence of the 16S-23S ITS region. Three distinct ribosomal operons were recovered from the genus, lending difficulty to recognizing further diversity in this morphologically cryptic genus.

J	Guan, C; Chen, N; Qiao, LJ; Zhao, CM				Guan, Chao; Chen, Ning; Qiao, Linjie; Zhao, Changming			Contrasting effects of biological soil crusts on soil respiration in a typical steppe	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Biological soil crusts (biocrusts), specialized communities of cyanobacteria, lichens, mosses, fungi and bacteria occurring on the ground surface, are key drivers of soil carbon (C) cycles in drylands, yet our understanding of how biocrusts directly and indirectly (through soil temperature or moisture) affect soil respiration and the contributions of biocrusts to soil C efflux is very limited. Using continuous field measurements in bare and biocrusted soils, we assessed the influence of biocrusts on soil respiration and the biocrust contribution to soil respiration over a one-year period and explained the mechanisms by which biocrusts directly and indirectly regulate soil respiration. Although the overall effect of biocrusts on soil respiration was positive, contrasting effects of biocrusts on soil respiration were also found. Unfortunately, the indirect effect of biocrusts on soil respiration through soil temperature or moisture was nonsignificant. The driving factor of total soil respiration was soil temperature, but soil moisture, photosynthetically active radiation and precipitation were driving factors for soil respiration in the biocrust layer. We proposed conceptual frameworks to explain the contrasting mechanisms by which biocrusts modulate soil respiration. In addition, biocrusts decreased the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration. Our findings indicate that biocrusts may alter the driving factors, forming contrasting mechanisms to regulate soil respiration in the biocrust layer, and emphasize the important roles of biocrusts as modulators of C cycles in dryland soils. Incorporating biocrusts into terrestrial C process models may improve predictions of climate change impacts on dryland ecosystems.

Enzyme activities as soil health indicators in relation to soil characteristics and crop production	AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES & ENVIRONMENT												Soil enzyme activities are known for early indicators of soil health but have not been related to most soil properties and crop yields. We examined the relationships among activities of four soil enzymes (beta-glucosidase [BG], N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase [NAG], arylsulfatase [AST], and phosphomonoesterase [PME]), 62 soil properties, and mean crop yields in two long-term (14- and 36-yr-old) dryland farming sites in the northern Great Plains, USA. Treatments were no-till and till crop rotations with spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), pea (Pisum sativum L.), and fallow with and without N fertilization. Soil samples collected before farming operations in April 2019 were analyzed for physical, chemical, biological, and biochemical properties and mean crop yields were determined. The principal component analysis (PCA) showed that BG was associated to most soil physical, chemical, biological, and biochemical properties followed by NAG and PME at both sites. The AST was associated to limited number of soil properties. The BG related to mean crop yield across years in one site and NAG related to yields in both sites, but AS and PME were not related to yields. Because of the greater sensitivity to cropping systems and relationships with most soil properties and long-term crop yields, BG and NAG activities may be considered as promising soil health indicators compared with other enzyme activities under dryland cropping systems in the northern Great Plains.

In-Water and On-Land Swimmers' Symmetry and Force Production	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Although performance and biomechanical evaluations are becoming more swimming-specific, dryland testing permits monitoring of a larger number of performance-related variables. However, as the degree of comparability of measurements conducted in-water and on land conditions is unclear, we aimed to assess the differences between force production in these two different conditions. Twelve elite swimmers performed a 30 s tethered swimming test and four isokinetic tests (shoulder and knee extension at 90 and 300 degrees/s) to assess peak force, peak and average torque, and power symmetry index. We observed contralateral symmetry in all the tests performed, e.g., for 30 s tethered swimming and peak torque shoulder extension at 90 degrees/s: 178 +/- 50 vs. 183 +/- 56 N (p = 0.38) and 95 +/- 37 vs. 94 +/- 35 N x m (p = 0.52). Moderate to very large direct relationships were evident between dryland testing and swimming force production (r = 0.62 to 0.96; p < 0.05). Swimmers maintained similar symmetry index values independently of the testing conditions (r = -0.06 to -0.41 and 0.04 to 0.44; p = 0.18-0.88). Asymmetries in water seems to be more related to technical constraints than muscular imbalances, but swimmers that displayed higher propulsive forces were the ones with greater force values on land. Thus, tethered swimming and isokinetic evaluations are useful for assessing muscular imbalances regarding propulsive force production and technical asymmetries.

Objectives This study took the Huangshui River Basin (HRB) as an example to understand the supply-demand relationship of WPS in the urbanizing basins on the TP. Methods A combination of the statistical data and water purification model was used to quantify the WPS demand from point source pollution and non-point source pollution, as well as the WPS supply from water, vegetation and soil. Results Compared with the existing studies, the proposed method can quantify the supply-demand relationship of WPS more comprehensively and accurately, evidenced by the decrease of root mean square error from 1.00-1.96 to 0.68 and the increase of correlation coefficient from 0.50-0.53 to 0.66. We found that the demand was 44.7% higher than the supply in the HRB in 2019. The increase of urban point source pollution was discovered to be the main reason for such imbalance, while water shortage and flawed landscape configuration also played a role. Conclusions This study comprehensively quantifies the supply and demand of WPS and reveals that the supply-demand imbalance of WPS in the HRB had resulted in substandard water quality, threating local and downstream sustainability. Therefore, it is urgent to control the urban point source pollution and optimize the landscape configuration in this region.

Extreme weather events and transmission losses in arid streams	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Alimited understanding of how extreme weather events affect groundwater hinders our ability to predict climate change impacts in drylands, where channel transmission losses are often the primary recharge mechanism. In this study, we investigate how potential changes to precipitation intensity and temperature will affect the water balance of a typical first-order, arid watershed located in the Chihuahuan Desert. Weutilize a process-based hydrologic model driven by stochastically-downscaled simulations from a set of climate models, emissions scenarios, and future periods. Across many simulations, the average daily storm size is the primary factor that controls transmission losses with larger precipitation amounts increasing channel infiltration while simultaneously decreasing land surface evapotranspiration. Extreme events (> 25 mm d(-1)) that account for less than 30% of the annual precipitation, contribute almost 50% of the focused recharge. As a result, climatic changes leading to larger, less frequent storms will result in higher channel transmission losses in arid regions.

Farmers' ecological knowledge has proven to be a valuable tool in addressing its challenges. How farmers perceive LD affects how they deal with induced risks, and their responses to these perceptions will shape restoration options and outcomes. Therefore, this study assessed farmers' perceptions of LD along a climatic gradient in three regions of Mali. We interviewed 270 farmers, and we analyzed their responses using descriptive statistics and Spearman rank-order correlation. We found that the respondents were aware of LD and have identified its key indicators and its impacts on their livelihoods. Moreover, we found that farmers' perceptions are not influenced by gender, age, or education level, but rather by agricultural training, participation in agricultural labor, the practice of fallowing, shortage of firewood, livestock, household size, appearance of some plant species and famine. Additionally, farmers' perceptions of LD vary along the climatic gradient as they correlate to different variables in each agro-ecological zone. LD's impacts, however, decrease in severity along the north-south gradient, although they are linked to the same variables. As LD is seen through a reduction of ecosystem services provisioning capacity because of the local communities' heavy dependence on natural resources, actions should be geared towards agronomic and vegetative land management options. Such actions should prioritize context-specific soil and water conservation techniques and proven indigenous practices.

Quantitative evaluation of grazing effect on nomadically grazed grassland ecosystems by using time-lapse cameras	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Grazing is a key factor in grassland disturbance that affects plant biomass, soil properties, and carbon exchange in grasslands. The objective of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the effects of grazing on grassland ecosystems in Mongolia. To this end, we developed a new method for determining the actual and quantitative livestock effects. Fenced (ungrazed) plots were established in two nomadically grazed grasslands in Mongolia, Bayan-Unjuul (BU) and Baganuur (BN), and time-lapse cameras were installed at the plots for photographing outside the fences (grazed area) every 10 min. Using images collected for 3 years (2016 - 2018), we counted the number of livestock animals by species and calculated grazing intensity (GI). In addition, we investigated plant biomass; CO2 fluxes including gross primary production and ecosystem respiration; and soil properties during mid-August at the BU and BN sites. Our new method enabled us to quantitatively assess the seasonal and interannual variations and spatial differences in GI. Livestock used the BU site mainly in spring but the BN site in summer. Using the seasonal GIs, we performed linear regressions to examine grazing effects on plant biomass, CO2 exchanges, and soil properties. Our results indicated that, among the livestock species we monitored, grazing by goats most strongly affects the grassland function and structures. GI negatively correlated with aboveground biomass (AGB), CO2 fluxes, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total nitrogen (TN), suggesting that these parameters decreased with increasing GI. The effect size of grazing on AGB was negative for all years and sites, indicating that grazing consistently decreased AGB, whereas CO2 fluxes, SOC, and TN were positive when the GI was low. By using our new method, we obtained the certain values of GI at which the grazing effect shifted from positive to negative.

Based on the coleoptile length, these were categorised for coleoptile length as short (2.5-4.5 cm), medium (4.6-6.5 cm) and long (6.6-9 cm) respectively. Small and medium coleoptile length genotypes had comparable plant height (100.07cm and 99.29 cm, respectively) whereas, longer coleoptile genotypes were in general taller (103.78cm) numerically and for each class, the speed of germination was almost similar.A set of linked SSRs markers was used to screen the genotypes for molecular characterization based on GA responsive genes. In wheat, longer coleoptile length with reduced height is primarily controlled by GA responsive reduced height genes like Rht8, Rhtl2 etc., therefore, the material was screened to identify genotypes possessing GA responsive reduced height genes with available molecular markers. Molecular screening for Rht genes revealed five Rht8 positive genotypes having longer coleoptile length and good seedling vigour. Thus, Rht8 genes had positive effect on coleoptile length and had no detrimental effect on root length of seedling and provided better field emergence in field. Hence, these genotypes can be used for the development of variety for dry land agriculture and underconservation agriculture practices.

Potential for Sugarcane Production Under Current and Future Climates in South Africa: Sugar and Ethanol Yields, and Crop Water Use	SUGAR TECH					30th Congress of the International-Society-of-Sugar-Cane-Technologists (ISSCT)	SEP 02-05, 2019	Tucuman, ARGENTINA	Int Soc Sugar Cane Technologists				Spatial information on crop productivity and resource use is required to enable efficient sugarcane production with limited resources and under a changing climate. The objective of this study was to estimate biomass, sugar and ethanol yields for high-sucrose (HS) and high-fibre (HF) sugarcane cultivars for current and future climate in water limited South Africa. An upgraded version of the Canegro sugarcane model, calibrated for a HS and HF cultivar, was used to simulate biomass component yields for 1,986 agro-climatic zones. Ethanol yields were calculated from simulated biomass fractions and theoretical conversion efficiencies. Historical daily weather data for 1971-1990 were used to represent the baseline climate, while daily weather data generated from three global circulation models for 1971-1990 and 2046-2065 were used to project future changes in climate. Simulations show that the HF cultivar produced higher (15-35%) biomass and ethanol yields than the HS cultivar, but also used slightly more (similar to 4%) water. Climate change is projected to increase dryland yields for both cultivar types (8-19%) Irrigated yields will not change much in current high potential areas (1-5%), given adequate water supply, while yields could increase substantially in current cool areas (similar to 20%). Water and irrigation requirements are expected to increase (9-15%) under a future climate. New areas could be become suitable for irrigated and dryland production. The information produced in this study can be used to assist decision-making for: (1) optimizing production and processing processes and (2) the development of sustainable greenfield projects in marginal areas of South Africa.

However, the dynamic changes of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) under continuous straw and plastic mulching is rarely mentioned. A field experiment was conducted over four consecutive wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-maize (Zea mays L.) rotation cycles in Northwest China to determine dynamic changes in soil C and N under three treatments: CK (traditional non-mulched), PM (transparent plastic mulching), and SM (straw mulching). Over the four wheat-maize cycles, soil organic carbon (SOC) in SM increased by 18% in the 0-0.2 m soil layer, while in PM SOC decreased by 15%, and in CK SOC changed little. Total N under CK and SM remained basically unchanged over time, but declined over time under PM. The overall microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) under SM increased by 32% and 17%, respectively, after four rotation cycles compared with significant decreases of 29% and 22% under PM and little change under CK. SM reduced soil temperature and increased soil water content, while PM increased both ST and water relation to the CK. Both SM and PM treatments increased grain yield and reduced nitrate N leaching. In the long run, straw mulching can improve SOC, MBC, MBN, and wheat-maize yield, and should be the recommended mulching practice for sustainable wheat-maize production in dryland areas in response to the potential challenges of climate change to dryland agriculture.

Predicting Drivers of Collective Soil Function With Woody Plant Encroachment in Complex Landscapes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Dryland (arid and semiarid) ecosystems are extensive, home to a third of the human population, and a major contributor to terrestrial net primary productivity and associated biogeochemical cycles. Many dryland systems are undergoing woody plant encroachment, which can substantially alter landscape-scale soil nutrient dynamics via long-recognized "islands of fertility" mechanisms. To effectively constrain soil biogeochemistry responses to woody plant encroachment, predictions are needed for microbial biomass and especially microbial activity in addition to existing predictions for soil nutrients-referred to collectively hereafter as "collective soil functioning." Here we evaluated whether collective soil functioning could be predicted from a suite of metrics including plant cover, precipitation, soil physiochemical characteristics, and topographic variables across complex landscapes undergoing woody plant encroachment by mesquite (Prosopis velutina). Plant cover alone predicted nearly half of the variability (R-2 = 48.5%) in collective soil functioning and had a significant effect on each component of this index (soil nutrients, microbial biomass, and microbial activity). Prediction strength for collective soil functioning increased to 55.4%, and the error term decreased by 13.4% when precipitation, soil physiochemical characteristics, and topographic metrics were also included in models (plant and environment model). Besides the expected effects of plant cover, other significant predictors of collective soil functioning included state factors such as topography, precipitation, and parent material along with soil age and bulk density. These results illustrate that mesquites influence many components of soil functionality but the strength of this effect depends on which component is analyzed and which environmental variables are considered.

Winter wheat grain yield stability under different tillage practices	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Grain yield stability is vital for achieving yield consistency across a broad range of environments. The significance of this is well documented in crop genetic studies and may equally be relevant for tillage practices used in croplands. The objective of this study was to evaluate long-term winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain yield stability under different tillage practices. The study was designed as a randomized complete block with three replications. The independent variable was tillage with three levels: no tillage (NT), stubble mulch (SM), and moldboard plow (MP). The experiment was established as a winter wheat-fallow under a dryland cropping system. Each phase of the wheat-fallow was present each year. The historical grain yield data from 1972 to 2010 were presented in this study. Yield stability was assessed using regression coefficients (beta(i)) and squared deviation from regression (S(2)d). Grain yield had average stability because each tillage practice had a beta(i) of 1.0. The SM tillage had an S(2)d of 0.03 (P = .90), which was not significant than zero (0), while NT and MP had an S(2)d of 0.06 (P = .04) and 0.07 (P = .01), respectively, that were significant than zero (0). This suggests that SM had a more stable yield under different environments when compared with NT and MP. In general, using minimum tillage, such as SM, that maintains residues on the soil surface could contribute to yield resiliency across different environments and enhance land sustainability in dryland cropping systems.																			0002-1962	1435-0645				MAR	2023	115	2					1006	1014		10.1002/agj2.21236	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.21236		JAN 2023											WOS:000922736200001

Kinematic analysis of gait in an underwater treadmill using land-based Vicon T 40s motion capture cameras arranged externally	JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS												Aquatic therapy for rehabilitation can be performed in a variety of environments, which can vary from a traditional swimming pool to a self-contained underwater treadmill. While kinematic analysis has been performed in large volume swimming pools using specific underwater motion capture systems, researchers may only have access to a land-based motion-capture system, which is not waterproof. Additionally, underwater motion capture systems may not fit within the confines of a smaller underwater treadmill. Thus, the purpose of this study was to design and analyze methodology to quantify lower limb kinematics during an aquatic treadmill session, using a land-based motion capture system. Kinematics of lower limb motion at different speeds was studied while walking on an underwater treadmill in comparison to walking on the same treadmill without water (empty tank). The effects of the presence of water on walking kinematics was analyzed and interpreted using parametric and non-parametric testing procedures. The results suggest significant influences of speed on knee and ankle angles (p 0.05) in both dryland and aquatic scenarios. Knee and ankle angle measures revealed no significant differences between the dryland and water treadmill scenarios (p 0.05). The increased time requirement in water for the full gait cycle found in this study indicates influence of resistive effects. This finding can be especially suited for muscle strengthening and stabilizing treatments for lower limbs. Also, a framework was developed to realize a potential methodology to use land-based motion capture cameras to successfully analyze the kinematics of gait in constrained aquatic volumes.

Evidence from Inner Mongolian drylands	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Studies of the ecosystem services (ES) and human wellbeing (HWB) relationship have proliferated in recent decades, but few have examined how ES affect HWB over time in a region (i.e., the temporal ES-HWB rela-tionship) and how this relationship varies between regions. Thus, this study was intended to address these questions using data from Inner Mongolia. We first quantified multiple indicators of ES and objective HWB from 1978 to 2019, and then quantified their temporal relationship with correlation analysis over the entire duration and during four development periods, respectively. Our results showed that, depending on the time periods of analysis, geographic locations, and indicators, the temporal ES-HWB relationship varied substantially in both correlation strength and directionality (r values ranged from-0.93 to +1). Specifically, food-related provi-sioning services and cultural services often showed significant positive relationships with income, consumption, and basic living needs (r values ranged from +0.43 to +1), but erratic relationships with equity, employment, and social relationships (r values ranged from-0.93 to +0.96). Also, the positive correlations between food-related provisioning services and HWB were generally weaker in the urbanized regions. Cultural services and HWB were more strongly correlated in later development periods, whereas the relationship between regulating services and HWB was quite variable in space and time. The variations in the relationship over different development periods may be attributable to changing environmental and socioeconomic conditions, while the variations between regions were likely due to spatial heterogeneity of influencing factors. Our findings have an important policy implication for Inner Mongolia and beyond: sustainable management based on the ES and HWB relationship must be temporally adaptive and spatially tailored.																			0301-4797	1095-8630				AUG 1	2023	339								117930	10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.117930	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.117930		APR 2023						37075631					WOS:000984525500001

In Rano Raraku a transformed landscape is reconstructed based upon soil chemistry, micromorphology, and macro and micro-botanical data framed within a stratigraphic and radiocarbon informed Bayesian model that is the first for Rapa Nui. We focus on moat RR-0001-156, one of only three moai in the island-wide corpus known to be embellished with a dense suite of cohesive petroglyph motifs. Our results confirm a cultivated landscape present on the inner south and east slopes of Rano Raraku that included sweet potato and probably bottle gourd along with Polynesian transfers banana, taro, and paper mulberry from the 14th century AD continuing into the early 19th century AD. During this time of sociopolitical transformation and land use change across the island labor-intensive rock gardens were developed to increase productivity as soil fertility declined in the context of deforestation and perhaps drought while the pan-island center of 'Oroqo (Orongo) emerged at Rano Kau with an intensive ritual focus on fertility. Rano Raraku in sharp contrast had (and still has) extremely fertile soils that are the weathering byproduct of lapilli tuff sediments generated from the quarrying process and localized human activity. This study validates Rano Raraku as the major moat production center, establishes chronological parameters for the unique embellished statue and describes agricultural fertility to hypothesize a rich, multi-use landscape for Rano Raraku inner region that is unparalleled elsewhere on Rapa Nui.

One such context is the maintenance of biodiversity by facilitation in arid ecosystems. Here, we examined the complex interactions between local plant species richness and the intensity of shrub facilitation for maintaining biodiversity in arid plant communities. A synthesis including a meta-analysis was used to compile nearly 600 papers on positive interactions mediated by shrubs in dryland plant communities (search terms: shrub, positive, facilitat*) to examine whether interactions in these studies changed with reported local species richness. A total of 19 studies and 141 independent instances directly examined and reported facilitation of diversity measures in naturally assembled plant communities and provided estimates of local species richness. Synthesis. The net effect of increasing local plant species richness was negative and shifted the relative frequency of interactions with shrubs from positive to negative with increasing local species richness. This relationship suggests that increases in richness do not always enhance functions that maintain diversity in plants communities likely due to concurrent increases in the indirect negative interactions between species under shrubs or in changes in the local species pool.

However, comprehensive assessments of cropland ecological risks remain limited. This study developed an assessment method for cropland ecological risks by combining environmental disturbance with ecosystem vulnerability. Environmental disturbance reflects stresses caused by risk sources in an environment, while ecosystem vulnerability is the susceptibility of an ecosystem to adverse disturbances and its capacity to cope and adapt. The proposed method is conducive to understanding the complex exposure-response relationship between croplands and environmental stresses. Cropland ecological risk was evaluated by conducting a case study on a loess dryland region in Shaanxi. The hot spots and driving factors of risk were explored using spatial autocorrelation and quantile regression methods, respectively. Results show that overall cropland ecological risk is at medium low level. Risk hot spots are concentrated in the north of the loess dryland. Ecosystem vulnerability exerts greater effect on the distribution of hot spots than environmental disturbance in the study area. Road density (RDD), river density, and soil organic matter exert the most important effects on cropland ecological risk. Moreover, the same driving factor exhibits various effects on cropland ecological risk in different risk level areas. RDD, slope, precipitation, elevation, fertilizer application rate, gross domestic product, and distance to town center have greater effects on risk in regions with high cropland ecological risk than in regions with low cropland ecological risk. The findings of this study must be considered in formulating targeted policies for controlling cropland ecological risk in loess drylands to realize sustainable crop production.																			0301-4797	1095-8630				DEC 1	2023	347								119231	10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.119231	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.119231								37804628					WOS:001099997000001

How dryland vegetation responds to changes in precipitation and soil moisture in the context of a warming climate is not well understood. In this study, warm drylands in the temperate zone between 30 and 50 degrees N, including North America (NA), the Mediterranean region (MD), Central Asia (CA), and East Asia (EA), were selected as the study area. After verifying the trends and anomalies of three kinds of leaf area index (LAI) datasets (GLASS LAI, GLEAM LAI, and GLOBAMAP LAI) in the study area, we mainly used the climate (GPCC precipitation and ERA5 temperature), GLEAM soil moisture, and GLASS LAI datasets from 1981 to 2018 to analyze the response of vegetation growth to changes in precipitation and soil moisture. The results of the three mutually validated LAI datasets show an overall greening of dryland vegetation with the same increasing trend of 0.002 per year in LAI over the past 38 years. LAI and precipitation exhibited a strong correlation in the eastern part of the NA drylands and the northeastern part of the EA drylands. LAI and soil moisture exhibited a strong correlation in the eastern part of the NA drylands, the eastern part of the MD drylands, the southern part of the CA drylands, and the northeastern part of the EA drylands. The results of this study will contribute to the understanding of vegetation dynamics and their response to changing water conditions in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitude drylands.					ping, wang/JDM-6555-2023; ping, wang/JJC-2265-2023; Wang, Tianye/GXH-1310-2022; Wang, Ping/ACH-8897-2022	Wang, Tianye/0000-0001-7534-931X; Wang, Ping/0000-0003-2481-9953; Yu, Zongxu/0000-0002-2973-0475														2072-4292				AUG	2022	14	15							3511	10.3390/rs14153511	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14153511													WOS:000839723000001

Alternative planting geometries reduce production risk in corn and sorghum in water-limited environments	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Conserving soil water and making it available to plants, especially during reproduction and grain-filling periods, is one of the most challenging aspects of crop production in water-limited areas. In such areas, adoption of suitable planting geometry may play a key role in determining plant growth and yield. We reviewed the effect of different planting geometries, namely evenly spaced planting (ESP), clump (three plants close together), cluster (five plants close together), and skip-row (one row planted, one row skipped) in corn (Zea mays L.) and grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) in different agro-ecological environments and crop management practices. All other planting geometries are called "alternative planting geometries" in this paper. Most studies were conducted in the U.S. Southern Great Plains region, where annual precipitation is less than the potential evapotranspiration and the summer season is usually hot and dry. Results clearly showed the potential benefits of alternative planting geometries, such as reduced canopy temperature, improved microclimate within the crop canopy, less vegetative growth, comparable or greater grain yield, and higher harvest index compared with standard ESP. However, there is much to learn about the feasibility, other benefits, and risks associated with alternative planting geometries for sustainable dryland farming. More studies on weed dynamics, soil evaporation, root penetration, soil water extraction, and water use efficiency are required to complement the existing knowledge on alternative planting geometries.

However, given the differences in environments and crop species among regions, it is important to further understand whether the mulching-induced changes in soil temperature are beneficial to crop production. Here, we used winter wheat to study the effect of mulching on soil temperature, soil water content, dry matter and yield. Two 3-year field experiments were conducted at two sites over 6 consecutive years (2012-2015 at site 1, and 2015-2018 at site 2) in the semiarid rainfed thermal deficient areas of northwest China. In each experiment, three mulching treatments, including straw strip mulching (SSM), plastic film mulching (PFM) and non-mulching (CK), were tested in a replicated randomized block design. Compared with CK, SSM and PFM significantly increased grain yield by 18.6-69.1 % and 35.5-61.3 % in 2012-2017 growing seasons, except that there was no significant difference in the wet year (2017-2018). In the SSM treatment, soil temperature generally decreased at different growth stages, resulting in a slight decline of 0.9-1.9 degrees C in the 0-25 cm soil layer, whereas in the PFM treatment, soil temperature increased before the jointing stage and decreased subsequently. SSM reduced the daily variable amplitude of soil temperature by decreasing the maximum soil temperature, whereas PFM produced the same effect by decreasing the maximum soil temperature and increasing the minimum soil temperature, which could promote the winter wheat vegetative growth and yield formation in the six experimental years. SSM and PFM decreased accumulated soil temperature from the overwintering stage to maturity stage by 60.1-234.6 degrees C and 30.5-148.5 degrees C, respectively. The beneficial effect of the change in soil temperature in SSM and PFM plots expanded the storage capacity of winter wheat. Overall, the moderately cooling effect of mulching was conductive to promoting vegetative growth and expanding storage capacity, ultimately improving crop yield. Our results suggest that SSM can be adopted for sustainable winter wheat production in semiarid rainfed areas under thermal deficient conditions.																			0378-4290	1872-6852				SEP 15	2021	271								108244	10.1016/j.fcr.2021.108244	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2021.108244		JUL 2021											WOS:000687829200002

This study examines how the alpha and beta diversity indices vary along the elevation gradient and which factors are more responsible for arid and semi-arid plant diversity and community assembly. There were 121 species from 90 genera and 42 families found at elevations ranging from 1,200 to 2,600 m within the Ningxia Helan Mountain National Nature Reserve in China. These were primarily shrubs and herbs with characteristics adapted to extreme temperatures. The diversity of both the shrub layer and the herb layer was highest at mid-elevation, underscoring the importance of protecting mid-elevation ecosystems. Climatic distance and topographic distance were more influential than spatial distance in driving the species composition change of shrubs and herbs. In the herb layer, climatic, topographic, and spatial factors contributed more to community assembly than shrub communities. In this case, improving the environment in the community or introducing herbs could help the restoration of these places. These findings provide insight into biogeographic patterns, biodiversity growth mechanisms, and community formation processes. Moreover, it can improve projections of climate change within and across ecosystems and provide the scientific basis for the use and management of plant resources in arid and semi-arid regions.

Emissions of N<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> Following Short-Term Water and N Fertilization Events in Wheat-Based Cropping Systems	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions result from short-term perturbations of agricultural systems such as precipitation and fertilization events. We hypothesized that those agricultural systems with contrasting management histories may respond differently to application events of water and N fertilizer with respect to GHG emissions. Studies with long-term management histories consisting of no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) were coupled with high temporal resolution, automated chambers that monitored N2O and CO2 emissions for 22 h following treatments. Treatments applied to NT and CT were (a) control (no water or N additions), (b) simulated precipitation to achieve approximately 80% water-filled pore space, and (c) precipitation plus fertilizer additions of 150 kg N ha(-1) as ammonium nitrate. Emissions of CO2 increased with increase in moisture and temperature and decreased under fertilizer application. Water and nitrogen treatments in CT at the sites with 2 and 12-year history produced N2O fluxes greater than NT by 142 and 68%, respectively. The site with 10-year history of NT produced similar amounts of N2O from CT and NT treatments. The same treatments at the site with 31 year-long NT history, despite being one of the lowest among all sites, demonstrated 380% higher N2O fluxes from the NT than CT, which was likely due to higher levels of labile organic matter present in NT treatments. GHG emissions data regressed on measured soil C and N properties, fractionation, and mineralization data showed that N2O flux increased with reduction of acid-hydrolyzable N and increase of NH4-N in soil, which suggested that N2O production in the short-term water and water and N additions events is mostly produced via nitrification process. This indicates that neither the length of NT treatment nor the fertilizer application rate define the rate of N2O emissions, but the soil N availability controlled by organic matter mineralization rate. The current study demonstrates the need for further research on the effects of the early stages of NT adoption as well as long-term NT on N2O spikes associated with artificial or natural rainfall events immediately following extended dry periods.

In this paper, we analyze the adoption and impacts of SITs on sorghum yield and net revenue using data from a sample of 1680 households and 3310 plots in the sorghum belt of Nigeria. Our estimates are based on a multinomial endogenous switching regression, which accounts for observable and unobservable sources of selection bias. We find a relatively low joint adoption of both improved sorghum varieties and good agronomic practices. In addition, we find that the adoption of only improved sorghum varieties and the joint adoption of both improved sorghum varieties and good agronomic practices led to a 56 and 102% increase in sorghum yield, respectively, and an 88 and 82% increase in net revenue, respectively. The yield and net revenue effects indicate that there are considerable missing opportunities that sorghum-producing households can harness through the adoption of SITs. Our findings reveal that policies tailored towards promoting the widespread adoption of SITs can lead to considerable productivity gains and economic returns for smallholder sorghum farmers towards improving their welfare.																			1473-5903	1747-762X				DEC 31	2023	21	1							2270233	10.1080/14735903.2023.2270233	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2023.2270233													WOS:001095675600001

However, the effect of manure addition has not been well explored for dryland wheat production on the Loess Plateau, especially in year with less precipitation. Therefore, a 4-year field experiment was performed: manure fertilizer (with and without) and N fertilization levels (0, 60, 120, 180 and 240 kg ha-1) under two precipitation years (normal and dry year). The target was to quantify the effect of manure addition on: i) wheat yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), ii) crop growth and soil properties, and iii) wheat N status [N accumulation, N nutrition index (NNI)]. Compared with chemical N alone, manure addition increased topsoil organic matter, total nitrogen and the stability of macro-aggregate (R0.25). Manure addition increased grain yield by 12.5% in normal year and by 38.2% in dry year. The improved topsoil quality, root system, biomass (nitrogen) accumulation all occurred in NM120 or NM180 with manure addition, which brought an improvement of wheat yield and NUE with a suitable nitrogen nutrition status. NM180 (i.e., 150 kg N ha-1 +2000 kg ha-1 manure) and NM120 (i.e., 90 kg N ha-1 +2000 kg ha-1 manure) achieved the highest grain yield in normal and dry years, respectively.

The role of GRACE total water storage anomalies, streamflow and rainfall in stream salinity trends across Australia's Murray-Darling Basin during and post the Millennium Drought	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												By influencing water tables of saline aquifers, multiyear dry or wet periods can significantly delay or accelerate dryland salinity, but this effect remains poorly quantified at the large river basin scale. The Gravity and Climate Recovery Experiment (GRACE) satellite measures changes in the total water storage of river systems, providing a unique opportunity for better understanding connections between stream salinity and changes in catchment water storages at the large river basin scale. Here, we quantified the role of GRACE total water storage anomalies (TWSA) in stream salinity variability across Australia's Murray-Darling Basin ( similar to 1 million km(2)), while also accounting for streamflow and rainfall. We used the MERRA-2 global land surface model to i) place our findings in the context of the longer-term hydroclimatology (1980-present) and ii) to decompose TWSA into groundwater storage as an alternative driver variable. Multivariate time series regression models (generalized additive mixed models or GAMM) showed that the driver variables could explain 20-50% of the variability in stream salinity across 8 sub-catchments in the Murray Darling Basin. TWSA commonly explained as much variability as stream flow, while groundwater storage and TWSA had very similar explanatory power and rainfall only negligible contributions. The 2000-2009 Millennium Drought and the subsequent La Nina Floods had a predominantly decelerating and accelerating effect on stream salinity respectively and these trends were partially explained by trends in TWSA. Our study illustrates that GRACE can be a useful addition for monitoring and modeling dryland salinity over large river basins.

Soil quality indices as affected by long-term burning, irrigation, tillage, and fertility management	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Understanding the impacts of long-term agricultural practices on soil quality (SQ) is key for sustaining agroecosystem productivity. This study investigated conventional and no-tillage (NT), residue burning and no burning, residue level (high and low), and irrigation (irrigated and dryland) effects on soil properties, SQ, and crop yields following 16 yr of a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] double-crop system via the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF). A field experiment was conducted in the Lower Mississippi River Delta region on a silt-loam soil. Bulk density, soil organic C (SOC), total N (TN), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and soil P and K from the 0- to 10-cm soil depth were used as SQ indicators investigated individually and as an overall soil quality index (SQI). Following 16 yr, residue burning reduced SOC (1.1%) compared with no burning (1.24%). Irrigation resulted in greater soil TN than dryland management systems (p < 0.05). Reduced soil pH and extractable soil P and K occurred under NT, high residue, and irrigated treatments. Irrigation increased soybean yields, regardless of the tillage system. Burned, NT-high residue management increased wheat yields (3.45 Mg ha(-1)). Irrigation reduced SQ because of low EC and K scores. High residue reduced SQ compared with the low residue treatment within NT systems, owing to low pH scores. The SMAF indices identified the impacts of irrigation, NT, and optimal N fertilization on SQ. Monitoring of soil pH, P, and K may be needed to maintain SQ in long-term wheat-soybean systems.

Registration of 'WyoWinter' Feed Pea for the US Central Great Plains	JOURNAL OF PLANT REGISTRATIONS												'WyoWinter' (Reg. No. CV-29, PI 688001; experimental designation Wyo #11) is a winter feed pea [Pisum sativum L. ssp. sativum var. arvense (L.) Poir.] developed by the University of Wyoming and the Wyoming Agricultural Experiment Station and released in 2016 for its adaptation and high forage and seed yield in Wyoming. WyoWinter was derived from a cross between a selected late-flowering plant of landrace Austrian Winter and a late-flowering plant of landrace Common Austrian Winter. WyoWinter traces back to a single F-2 plant grown in a spaced-plant nursery and was developed by a combination of pedigree and bulk breeding methods. WyoWinter was evaluated in fall-sown yield trials in 2 yr, two locations, and two growing conditions (dryland and irrigated). Over 2 yr and two locations, forage yield of WyoWinter averaged 694 and 2739 kg ha(-1) and seed yield averaged 954 and 2249 kg ha(-1) under dryland and irrigated conditions, respectively. WyoWinter has indeterminate growth habit, and seed has yellow cotyledons and pigmented seed coat. The 1000-seed weight was 110 g. Forage nutritive values were high and comparable to check cultivars. WyoWinter exhibits excellent winterhardiness and good performance in southeast Wyoming and northwest Nebraska. It can be used as a forage crop, as grain for livestock feed, and as a green manure or cover crop. WyoWinter has potential to be integrated as a rotational crop in the winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-summer fallow farming system in the central Great Plains.																			1936-5209	1940-3496				MAY	2019	13	2					128	133		10.3198/jpr2018.07.0047crc	http://dx.doi.org/10.3198/jpr2018.07.0047crc													WOS:000467539900003

However, the major resources including water, heat, and light that influenced the yield of broomcorn millet in different dryland regions have rarely been explored. A three-season field experiment with three mulching practices i.e. traditional planting with non-mulching (TP), ridge-furrow mulching system (RF), and plastic film mulching (PFM) was conducted in three semi-arid regions in the Loess Plateau, China, i.e. Guyuan city (GY), Huining county (HN), and Yulin city (YL) between 2020 and 2022 to investigate the impacts of mulching regimes on soil hydrothermal conditions, agronomic characteristics, leaf photosynthetic properties, broomcorn millet yield, and water use efficiency (WUE). Results showed that both PFM and RF treatments increased soil temperature and moisture, and enhanced dry matter accumulation by promoting leaf photosynthetic capacity and chlorophyll content, thereby improving broomcorn millet yield and WUE. PFM and RF increased the average broomcorn millet yield by 15.08% and 24.86% at GY site, 20.86% and 25.61% at HN site, and 15.75% and 25.57% at YL site, respectively, and increased the average WUE by 16.31% and 27.48% at GY site, 23.21% and 28.80% at HN site, 15.55% and 28.57% at YL site, respectively. Partial least squares path modeling analysis revealed that soil moisture was an important environmental factor in determining broomcorn millet yield. Overall, RF practice can be taken to improve the management of agricultural climate factors and maximize yield, thereby promoting the sustainable development of dryland agriculture in the Loess Plateau.																			0301-4797	1095-8630				NOV 1	2023	345								118856	10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118856	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118856		AUG 2023						37619383					WOS:001088431100001

Diversified crop rotation and management system influence durum yield and quality	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Diversified crop rotation, sequence of crops within a rotation, and management system may affect durum (Triticum turgidum L.) yield and quality. This study investigated the impact of stacked vs. alternate-year rotation and conventional vs. ecological management system on dryland durum growth, yield, quality, and N relations from 2008 to 2011 in the northern Great Plains. Stacked rotations were durum-durum-canola (Brassica napus L.)-pea (Pisum sativum L.) (DDCP) and durum-durum-flax (Linum usitatissimum L.)-pea (DDFP). Alternate-year rotations were durum-canola-durum-pea (DCDP) and durum-flax-durum-pea (DFDP). Continuous durum (CD) was also included for comparison. Conventional management included the combination of tillage, recommended seed rate, broadcast N fertilization, and reduced stubble height; ecological management included no-tillage, increased seed rate, banded N fertilization, and greater stubble height. Durum height was 4-7 cm taller in the ecological than the conventional management with DCDP, DDCP, and DFDP. Plant height, spike number, grain yield, aboveground biomass, N accumulation, N removal index, and N-use efficiency were 8-46% greater in the ecological than the conventional management in wet years, but were 15-26% greater in the conventional management in dry years. Plant height, spike number, aboveground biomass, and seed weight varied with crop rotations and years. The ecological management improved durum growth, yield, and N relations in wet years, but the conventional management was superior in dry year. Producers can enhance dryland durum yield and quality by using the ecological management, especially in wet years, rather than relying on crop rotations.

The BIODESERT survey: assessing the impacts of grazing on the structure andfunctioning of global drylands	WEB ECOLOGY												Grazing by domestic livestock is both the main land use across drylands worldwide and a major desertification and global change driver. The ecological consequences of this key human activity have been studied for decades, and there is a wealth of information on its impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem processes. However, most field assessments of the ecological impacts of grazing on drylands conducted to date have been carried out at local or regional scales and have focused on single ecosystem attributes (e.g., plant productivity) or particular taxa (mainly aboveground, e.g., plants). Here we introduce the BIODESERT survey, the first systematic field survey devoted to evaluating the joint impacts of grazing by domestic livestock and climate on the structure and functioning of dryland ecosystems worldwide. This collaborative global survey was carried out between 2016 and 2019 and has involved the collection of field data and plant, biocrust, and soil samples from a total of 326 45 m x 45 m plots from 98 sites located in 25 countries from 6 continents. Here we describe the major characteristics and the field protocols used in this survey. We also introduce the organizational aspects followed, as these can be helpful to everyone wishing to establish a global collaborative network of researchers. The BIODESERT survey provides baseline data to assess the current status of dryland rangelands worldwide and the impacts of grazing on these key ecosystems, and it constitutes a good example of the power of collaborative research networks to study the ecology of our planet using much-needed field data.																			2193-3081	1399-1183				NOV 24	2022	22	2					75	96		10.5194/we-22-75-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/we-22-75-2022													WOS:000890740900001

Precipitation, runoff, and yields from terraced drylands with stubble-mulch or no tillage<SUP>1</SUP>	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Dryland crops rely on precipitation as their exclusive water source, but storm water runoff decreases the amount available for biomass and grain production. Management practices that minimize runoff often increase the opportunity time for infiltration and improve precipitation storage as soil water. Our objective was to quantify storm water runoff from contour farmed terraces in relation to precipitation and field characteristics and then relate runoff to soil water at planting and yields of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] grown in a 3-yr wheat-sorghum-fallow (WSF) rotation. Comparisons of long-term (1984-2010) runoff observations indicated mean annual runoff for both uncropped periods of the WSF rotation were significantly greater with no-tillage (NT) than stubble-mulch (SM) tillage. By contrast, soil loss was greater for SM than NT because residue cover of undisturbed NT soil was less subject to entrainment and loss. Increasing field slope from 1.2 to 1.8% produced greater fallow runoff, which is water lost from dryland production. Nevertheless, soil water was significantly greater with NT, which reduced evaporative losses during fallow compared with SM. Long-term wheat yields exhibited no difference due to tillage, but NT grain sorghum yields increased significantly over SM tillage. The data show that while runoff with NT was typically greater than SM, profile soil water at planting was also greater for NT and increased grain sorghum yields significantly. We conclude that decreasing evaporative water losses with NT residues is the primary factor affecting soil water conservation.

Agronomic and economic impacts of cover crops in Texas rolling plains cotton	AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES & ENVIRONMENT												Cover crops have been proposed as a resource that could enhance the effect of no-till (NT) cropping systems. Crop yield limitations due to cover crops in the U.S. Great Plains are a concern to potential adopters. This research determined the impact of cover crops on crop yield and economic return compared with conventional practices in dryland systems of the Texas Rolling Plains. The study conducted at the Texas A&M AgriLife Chillicothe Research Station evaluated the following treatments: (a) conventional till (CT); (b) NT, and NT with the following cover crops; (c) Austrian winter pea (Pisum sativum L.); (d) hairy vetch (Vicia villosa L.); (e) crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.); (f) winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.); and (g) a multi-species mixture. Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) yields, expenses, and returns were determined over a 4-yr period (2013-2016). Cover crops increased total seed costs compared to CT and NT. Hairy vetch and the multi-species mixture increased total expenses over CT and NT. However, no significant treatment effect was determined for crop yield or net return among treatments. A multi-species mixture did not provide an agronomic or economic advantage compared to single species cover crop approaches. Under dryland conditions in the Texas Rolling Plains, these selected cover crops maintained cotton yields without negatively affecting net returns. Other ecosystem services should be considered prior to implementing cover crops in studied cropping systems. Site-specific research is warranted in regions of the southern Great Plains where water may be more limited than the Texas Rolling Plains.

The present study investigated the effect of salicylic acid on the physiological traits, antioxidant enzymes, yield, and quality of Allium hirtifolium (shallots) under drought conditions for three years (2016-2017, 2017-2018, and 2018-2019). The experiment was conducted as a split-plot based on a randomized complete block design with four repeats. Irrigation as the main factor in four levels of 100% (full irrigation), 75% and 50% of the plant water requirements with non-irrigation (dryland), and salicylic acid as the sub-factor in four levels of 0, 0.75, and 1 mmol, were the studied factors in this research. The combined analysis of three-year data showed that drought reduced leaf relative water content (RWC), membrane stability index (MSI), chlorophyll content, onion yield, and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes, proline content, tang, and allicin of shallots. Shallot spraying with salicylic acid improved leaf RWC, MSI, chlorophyll content, and onion yield. The highest yield of onion (1427 gr m(-2)) belonged to full irrigation and foliar application of 1 mmol salicylic acid. The lowest yield (419.8 gr m(-2)) belonged to plats with non-irrigation and non-application of salicylic acid. By improving the effective physiological traits in resistance to water deficit, salicylic acid adjusted the effects of water deficit on the yield of shallots. Foliar application of 1 mmol salicylic acid in dryland and irrigation of 50% of the plant water requirement increased onion yield by 15.12% and 29.39%, respectively, compared to the control treatment without salicylic acid.

J	Pei, W; Fu, Q; Liu, D; Li, TX				Pei, Wei; Fu, Qiang; Liu, Dong; Li, Tianxiao			A drought index for Rainfed agriculture: The Standardized Precipitation Crop Evapotranspiration Index (SPCEI)	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												A drought index is one of the main methods used for measuring drought and represents the basis of drought monitoring, early warning, and classification. On the basis of an analysis of the advantages and limitations of the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), the Standardized Precipitation Crop Evapotranspiration Index (SPCEI), which is a drought index of rainfed agriculture, was constructed in this study. The applicable conditions of the SPCEI were then investigated, and the results showed that the SPCEI was suitable for dryland crops under non-irrigated conditions in arid and semi-arid areas. The difference between the SPEI and SPCEI is analysed. Compared with the SPEI, the SPCEI considers crop evapotranspiration and the crop growth stage and was found to be more suitable for monitoring agricultural drought. Qigihar, which is located in a semi-arid area in western Heilongjiang Province, China, was then analysed as an example. The characteristics of the spatial and temporal variability of regional agricultural drought were analysed based on maize and soybean in dryland areas. The results for the different growth stages of maize and soybean showed that drought intensity is more serious in the initial stage in the middle part. In crop development, mid-season and late season stage, the drought conditions gradually increased from north to south. The drought degree of the two crops at the initial stage gradually increased, and the drought degree at the crop development stage gradually decreased. The main reason is that precipitation gradually increases during the crop development stage.

The factors that control the pool dynamics were also examined. Three water extraction indices were used, these included Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified NDWI and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index. In addition, random forest classifier and Sentinel-1 SAR data were used in mapping pools and pools dynamics for both sites. Overall, the remotely-sensed methods detected and mapped pools with acceptable accuracy, except for small pools (<400 m(2)). The results suggest that flow occurrences and rainfall are key in controlling temporal changes in pools sizes, and there was no interaction between pools and groundwater. The study showed that remote sensing methods are essential for filling ground monitoring gaps in non-perennial rivers and determining hydrological processes and water availability from pools in semi-arid environments.

Identifying clusters of irrigators' water trade and farm management strategies in Australia	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Australia, in particular the southern Murray-Darling Basin, has the most advanced water market in the world. However, there is still much to be understood as to how and why irrigators use the water market, and in what combination with other farm management strategies. This study used principal component analysis to identify five clusters of southern Murray-Darling Basin irrigators from a set of twenty possible farm and water strategies during 2015-16 (n = 977). Multinomial logit regression was then used to identify influences associated with each cluster. The five clusters of irrigators include those: expanding the farm (includes buying temporary water); expanding and diversifying (includes buying permanent water); downsizing (selling both temporary and permanent water); transitioning (switching away from irrigation to dryland); and saving (using carryover - water saved in storages for the following year). Around a third of irrigators can be classified as trying to expand the farm (the Expanders and the Expanders & Diversifiers); another third, of typically older irrigators, have lower levels of debt and excess water (the Savers); while a final third, who also tend to be older but also face financial and/or psychological stress, are placing more emphasis on dryland production (away from irrigation) or decreasing agricultural production altogether (the Transitioners and Downsizers). Higher long-term temperature of a farm area's location increased the probability of the irrigator being a downsizer, indicating a future trend of irrigation farm exit, given the predicted rise in temperature from climate change in the Murray-Darling Basin.

Conservation reserves in dryland regions aim to restore ecological processes and facilitate biodiversity conservation by functioning as refuges from grazing by livestock. However, grazing pressure in conservation reserves may be high and hamper conservation objectives because wild herbivore populations have irrupted in the surrounding landscape due to predator control as well as the absence of hunting and competition with livestock within reserves. Here, we assess the relative abundance of native herbivores (kangaroos) and introduced herbivores (rabbits) using driving transects and dung surveys, and use selective exclosures to assess wild herbivores' impacts on vegetation and soils in four conservation reserves in semi-arid Australia. Kangaroos were the dominant herbivore in each reserve. Grazing by kangaroos and/or rabbits was linked to reduced complexity of understorey vegetation, grass cover, species richness of grasses, forbs and shrubs, the depletion of soil carbon and phosphorous, and increased soil bulk density. The marked impacts of grazing by wild herbivores, particularly kangaroos, on vegetation and soils that we report are symptomatic of overgrazing. Our study provides evidence that grazing by kangaroos may jeopardize conservation efforts across a large region of semi-arid Australia. We contend that managing the total grazing pressure exerted by wild herbivores is crucial to prevent overgrazing in dryland conservation reserves where herbivore populations are not regulated by predators.

Productivity and Soil Water Availability in the Short Term	AGRICULTURE-BASEL												Increasing within-season dry spells in Southern Africa in recent years have generated growing interest in conservation agriculture (CA) to secure crop yields, especially under rainfed systems. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of CA on finger millet's (Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn) growth, yield and water use efficiency on nutrient-depleted sandy soils. Five treatments, namely (conventional tillage (control), conventional tillage + mulch (partial CA1), reduced tillage only (partial CA2), reduced tillage + mulching (partial CA3) and reduced tillage + mulching + intercropping (full CA)) were evaluated over two consecutive cropping seasons (2015/16 and 2016/17) on-farm in the village of Chidora in Hwedza District, southeast Zimbabwe. All mulched treatments had 15-32% more soil water content over the two growing seasons compared to the control. The higher soil water content under the mulched treatments significantly improved finger millet growth and development during both seasons as evidenced by the lower number of days to emergence (3 days less), greater shoot biomass, higher number of productive tillers and higher number of fingers produced. The full CA treatment achieved the best finger millet grain yield of 1.07 and 1.29 t ha(-1) during the 2015/16 and 2016/17 seasons, respectively. Full CA, partial CA3 and partial CA1 increased finger millet grain yield by 70%, 14% and 17% during the 2015/16 cropping season compared to the control. During the 2016/17 cropping season, a similar trend in finger millet grain yield was observed. Full CA was also among the most efficient methods in terms of water utilization (WUE), especially during the 2015/16 season. We concluded that CA, particularly when practiced in full, was more effective at offsetting the water limitations imposed by intra-seasonal dry spells on finger millet and significantly improved productivity.

Plant recruitment in drylands varies by site, year, and seeding technique	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Restoration in dryland ecosystems is hindered by low establishment of seeded species. As such, evaluations of current seeding methods are critical to understanding limitations and barriers to seeding success. Drill seeding is perceived as an optimal seeding strategy in many dryland ecosystems, but broadcast seeding is more commonly used as a seeding method due to physical and logistical constraints. For example, broadcast seeding may be conducted by aerial drops where other methods are limited by topography or obstructive features in the landscape. Few studies have quantified the differences between drill and broadcast seeding through space and time. We compare 2-year recruitment of emergent Pseudoroegneria spicata (bluebunch wheatgrass) seedlings in the sagebrush steppe biome for drill versus broadcast seeding methods across three seeding years, three landscape aspects and two soil types using a 95% confidence interval approach to avoid the penalty of multiplicity. We found drill seeding had 2.7 times greater recruitment of seedlings after 2 years compared with broadcast seeding. However, differences were highly subject to seeding year, aspect and soil type, likely because of soil moisture and temperature variations. Drill seeding had an advantage on clay soils with flat and north aspects (10.1 and 4.6 times greater for drill than broadcast seeding, respectively). In most conditions, drill seeding had greater recruitment than broadcast seeding, though in 2014 on south aspects broadcast seeding had 2.7 times greater recruitment than drill seeding. The results of this study demonstrate a need for restoration plans that account for spatiotemporal variation in seeding success.																			1061-2971	1526-100X				2022 SEP 1	2022									e13750	10.1111/rec.13750	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.13750		SEP 2022											WOS:000848022900001
J	Kimura, R				Kimura, Reiji			Global detection of aridification or increasing wetness in arid regions from 2001 to 2013	NATURAL HAZARDS												Arid regions are highly vulnerable to climate change and human activity, and global warming in particular has the potential to increase the arid land area. One traditional way to evaluate the extent of climate change in dryland regions is to use the aridity index (AI), defined as the ratio of annual rainfall to annual potential evapotranspiration. However, the AI is a climatic index; it does not represent actual conditions of aridity in arid regions. In contrast, the satellite-based aridity index (SbAI), which is based on day/night land surface temperature changes, is considered to represent actual conditions of moisture availability. Arid regions during 2001-2013 were classified at global scale by comparing the SbAI with the AI, that is, within Turc space, which is based on the water balance concept. In addition, factors contributing to aridification or wetness changes detected in different global regions were examined by comparing the SbAI and AI result with the yearly maximum normalized difference vegetation index and past land use. As a result, dryland regions were newly classified into five zones. In the stable zone, land areas were classified into hyper-arid, arid, semi-arid, or dry sub-humid regions by both the SbAI and the AI. Areas in the transition zone toward dryness are moderately dry. Areas in the transition zone toward wetness include large river basins, oases, and wadis with little rainfall. In the moist zone, rainfed or irrigated farming is being successfully conducted. Many parts of the dry zone, however, are extremely dry.

In the present study, we examined the characteristics and applicability of the green chromatic coordinate (GCC) index for monitoring vegetation parameters in semi-arid grasslands. From 2016 to 2019, digital images were collected using time-lapse cameras at 10-min intervals at two grassland sites in Mongolia. The GCC was calculated from the digital number values of red, green, and blue channels of the images. The results demonstrated that GCC values on sunny days were nearly constant between 1100 local time (LT) and 1500 LT regardless of solar altitude and direction. However, the GCC showed erroneous values under low illumination conditions on cloudy and rainy days. In addition, the GCC showed clear seasonal changes similar to the satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and greenery ratio (GR). The variation in GCC agreed better with that in GR than in NDVI. Finally, the GCC value was highly correlated with plant aboveground biomass and was probably related to CO2 fluxes. Thus, our findings suggest the feasibility of using a digital camera system for continuous long-term monitoring of vegetation parameters and phenology in semi-arid grasslands.																			0021-8588	1881-0136				JUL	2023	79	3					114	119		10.2480/agrmet.D-23-00008	http://dx.doi.org/10.2480/agrmet.D-23-00008													WOS:001029237900001

How to induce ant-plant interactions: Seed baiting to enhance its dispersal as a tool for restoration	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY												In degraded drylands, direct sowing is one of the most widespread revegetation practices, but its efficiency is low and usually seed enhancement techniques are needed to increase its success. We evaluated how to induce seed dispersal by ants (myrmecochory), as this interaction could improve the chances of seed germination and seedling establishment, via seed transport to ants' nests where seeds are protected and the soils enriched. Our objective was to develop seeds with the addition of baits attractive to ants without affecting seed germination. First, we tested the attractiveness of baits of different sizes and ingredients by performing cafeteria experiments in nests of the omnivorous ant Dorymyrmex tener, the most abundant and effective seed disperser ant in the Patagonian steppe. Then, we attached the most preferred baits (small baits containing pate, sugar and clay) to seeds of two native plants species (Acaena splendens and Oenothera odorata) with relevant characteristics for restoration purposes and tested their attractiveness to ants. We used different strategies to attach the bait to the seeds (e.g. encrusted, agglomerate and seeds on the surface) looking for the most attractive and simplest one. We found that only baited seeds were removed and the interaction was induced regardless of the way the bait was attached. Also, germination of seeds with bait was similar to that of seeds without bait in O. odorata, but reduced in A. splendens. We showed that it is possible to encourage ants to transport previously non-attractive seeds through the design of baits, potentially improving direct sowing efficiency.

Influence of continuous application of feedlot manure and legacy treatments on soil organic carbon, soil hydrophobicity, and soil water repellency	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Continuous or discontinued manure applications to agricultural soils may impact soil organic carbon (SOC) and water balances because of manure carbon inputs and the potential for manure-induced soil hydrophobicity (SH) and soil water repellency (SWR). A laboratory study was conducted using a long-term (44 yr) field experiment on a clay loam soil to determine the effect of application rate of feedlot manure under dryland (0, 30, 60, and 120 Mg.ha(-1) wet weight) and irrigation (0, 60, 120, and 180 Mg.ha(-1)) on SOC, SH, and SWR. In addition, we compared the effect of 44 yr of continuous annual manure applications (C44) to legacy treatments which had discontinued applications for 14 (D14) or 30 yr (D30). Laboratory measurements were conducted on air-dried and sieved (<2 mm) soil to determine SOC, SH using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and SWR using the repellency index (RI) method. Mean RI values for all treatments ranged from 2.20 to 13.0, indicating subcritical (RI > 1.95) SWR. Manure application rate had a significant (P (<= )0.05) and positive effect on SOC and SH, and both followed an exponential model. In contrast, RI had a negative response to the application rate under dryland and had no response under irrigation. Overall, positive responses of SOC and SH to application rate supported our hypothesis, but it was not supported for RI. The hypothesis of greater SOC, SH, and RI for continuous versus discontinued treatments was also supported for SOC and SH but not for RI.																			0008-4271	1918-1841				SEP	2021	101	3					439	451		10.1139/cjss-2020-0074	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjss-2020-0074													WOS:000688101000008

Phytophthora root rot of chickpea: inoculum concentration and seasonally dependent success for qPCR based predictions of disease and yield loss	AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY												Phytophthora root rot (PRR) caused byPhytophthora medicaginis(Pm) is an important disease of chickpea in Australia. There are limited control options, with avoiding planting chickpeas in paddocks with a high PRR risk a key management strategy. Currently, risk assessment is based solely on paddock history of PRR, without any measure of Pm inoculum. We developed a qPCR test to quantify Pm inoculum concentrations in soil and evaluated its ability to predict, prior to planting, PRR disease and yield loss in chickpea. The qPCR test was specific to Pm and did not cross react with otherPhytophthoraspecies found in Australian agricultural systems and was sensitive, being able to detect <1 Pm oospore/g soil. A field experiment showed no correlation between Pm DNA concentration at seeding and PRR development on the susceptible chickpea variety, Sonali. Field experiments with Yorker, a PRR moderately resistant variety, showed Pm DNA concentration at seeding was correlated with PRR development and grain yield, but relationships varied with season and soil moisture (2015, irrigated r(2)0.752, dryland r(2)0.532; 2017 irrigated r(2)0.52, dryland r(2)0.0005), however above average rainfall in 2016 was highly conducive to PRR and there was no relationship between Pm DNA concentrations at seeding and PRR development or yield. The qPCR could detect moderate to high levels of Pm inoculum, but not low levels capable of causing disease and yield loss in conducive seasons. The Pm qPCR test showed potential to support in-field diagnostics.					bithell, sean/IUO-2029-2023; harden, steven/AAB-1796-2019; Bithell, Sean/W-1839-2019	harden, steven/0000-0002-0632-2452; Bithell, Sean/0000-0001-6263-6707													0815-3191	1448-6032				JAN	2021	50	1					91	103		10.1007/s13313-020-00752-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13313-020-00752-2		OCT 2020											WOS:000579056000001

Therefore, it is of great significance to understand the effects of two major dryland systems on goose growth performance and immune status. The current study revealed that the floor rearing system (FRS) improved growth performance, but the immune function of geese was promoted to some extent in the cage-rearing system (CRS). Moreover, we found the phenylalanine metabolism pathway could exert positive effects on the immune function of geese under CRS. These findings can provide a reliable reference for selecting a dryland rearing system in geese.Abstract Currently, FRS and CRS are the two predominant dryland rearing systems in the goose industry. However, the effects of these two systems on goose growth performance and health, as well as the underlying mechanisms, have not been fully clarified. Thus, this study aimed to compare growth performance and immune status, as well as investigate the genome-wide transcriptomic profiles of spleen in geese, between CRS and FRS at 270 d of age. Phenotypically, the body weight and body size traits were higher in geese under FRS, while the weight and organ index of spleen were higher in geese under CRS (p < 0.05). Noticeably, the bursa of Fabricius of geese under FRS was degenerated, while that under CRS was retained. At the serum level, the immune globulin-G (IgG) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were higher in geese under CRS (p < 0.05). At the transcriptomic level, we identified 251 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the spleen between CRS and FRS, which were mainly enriched in scavenger receptor activity, inflammatory response, immune response, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, phenylalanine metabolism, ECM receptor interaction, calcium signaling pathway, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and MAPK signaling pathways. Furthermore, through protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, ten candidate genes were identified, namely, VEGFA, FGF2, NGF, GPC1, NKX2-5, FGFR1, FGF1, MEIS1, CD36, and PAH. Further analysis demonstrated that geese in CRS could improve their immune ability through the "phenylalanine metabolism" pathway. Our results revealed that the FRS improved growth performance, whereas the CRS improved goose immune function by increasing levels of IL-6 and IgG in serum. Moreover, the phenylalanine metabolism pathway could exert positive effects on immune function of geese under CRS. These results can provide reliable references for understanding how floor and cage rearing systems affect goose growth performance and immune capacity.

This study aimed to evaluate different pasture management options in relation to their effect on soil C stocks and soil organic matter (SOM) humification. Pastures in four beef cattle production systems were assessed: intensive and irrigated pasture with high stocking rate (IHS); dryland pasture with high stocking rate (DHS); dryland pasture with moderate stocking rate (DMS); degraded pasture (DP). The soil under the native forest was also evaluated and soil carbon stocks from the 0-100 and 0-30 cm layers were assessed. Carbon stocks (0-100 cm) ranged from 99.88 to 142.33 Mg ha(-1) in DP and DMS, respectively and were, respectively, 14 % and 24 % higher compared to the soil under the forest and indicate the capacity of adequately managed tropical pastures to mitigate GHG emissions from livestock production. Humification indexes indicated the presence of more labile C in pastures with greater C accumulation (DHS and DMS), mainly in the upper soil layers, indicating recent C accumulation resulting from correct management. However, more labile C can be easily lost to the atmosphere as CO2, depending on pasture management. Low C stocks associated with high humification indexes are characteristics of DP in which significant amounts of SOM are lost. It is necessary to develop technologies to improve C sequestration in IHS and results indicate the importance of quantifying C stocks in association with C stability.

Despite increasing recognition of plant hydraulic and stomatal dynamics not captured by isohydricity, defined as the sensitivity of leaf water potential psi(l) to soil water potential, it remains unclear which plant traits are critical to improved representation of plant hydraulic and stomatal dynamics beyond isohydricity, especially in dryland ecosystems. Here, we examine eco-physiological responses of two typical desert riparian species, Populus euphratica and Tamarix ramosissima, to hydro-meteorological variations. Based on measured hydraulic traits, variations of psi(l), leaf gas exchange, groundwater table, and soil moisture across vertical profiles, we investigated how subsurface hydraulic conditions control plant hydraulic sensitivity and stomatal regulation. We found both species exhibited anisohydric behaviors, which, however, were attributed to drying soil at different depths because of root distributions. The similar anisohydric behaviors also led to distinct stomatal regulation, due to the impact of atmospheric dryness decoupled from soil moisture and different sensitivities of stomatal conductance (g(s)) to psi(l). The latter was found to be dynamic throughout the growing season, which dominated the seasonal variation of g(s) and thus should not be neglected. The results suggest similar anisohydric behaviors could imply diverging hydraulic behaviors as the evaporate demand and flow regime change. Root morphological trait and stomatal sensitivity to psi(l) are identified as keys to characterize responses to water stresses in desert riparian ecosystems. Our findings highlight that improved measurements and representations of these traits could contribute to better assessments of dryland ecosystem functions.

However, global climate change and anthropogenic activity make water resource management more difficult, and this situation may be particularly crucial for dryland restoration, because of variation in water uptake patterns associated with artificial revegetation of different ages and vegetation type. However, there is lacking long-term restorations that are suitable for studying this issue. In Shapotou area, Northwest China, artificial revegetation areas were planted several times beginning in 1956, and now form a chronosequence of sand-binding landscapes that are ideal for studying variability in water uptake source by plants over succession. The stable isotopes delta O-18 and delta H-2 were employed to investigate the water uptake patterns of the typical revegetation shrubs Artemisia ordosica and Caragana korshinskii, which were planted in different years. We compared the stable isotope ratios of shrub stem water to groundwater, precipitation, and soil water pools at five layers (5-10, 10-40, 40-80, 80-150, and 150-300 cm). The results indicate that Artemisia ordosica derived the majority of their water from the 20-150 cm soil layer, whereas Caragana korshinskii obtained water from the 40-150 cm soil layer. The main water sources of Artemisia ordosica and C. korshinskii plants changed over time, from deeper about 150 cm depth to shallow 20 cm soil layer. This study can provide insights into water uptake patterns of major desert vegetation and thus water management of artificial ecosystems, at least in Northwest China.

Existing carrying capacity assessments are limited by low spatiotemporal resolution and high generalization, which hampers applied ecological management decisions. This paper provides an example for deriving the carrying capacity and utilization levels for cold drylands at a new level of detail by including major parts of the transhumance system. We combined field data on vegetation biomass and communities, forage quality, productivity, livestock species and quantities, grazing areas and their spatiotemporal variations with Sentinel-2 and MODIS snow cover satellite imagery to develop maps of forage requirements and availability. These products were used to calculate carrying capacity and grazing potential in the Pamir-Hindukush Mountains. Results showed high spatial variability of utilization rates between 5% and 77%. About 30% of the area showed unsustainable grazing above the carrying capacity. Utilization rates displayed strong spatial differences with unsustainable grazing in winter pastures and at lower elevations, and low rates at higher altitudes. The forage requirements of wild herbivores (ungulates and marmots) were estimated to be negligible compared to livestock, with one tenth of the biomass consumption and no increase in unsustainably grazed pastures due to the wider distribution of animals. The assessment was sensitive to model parameterization of forage requirements and demand, whereby conservative scenarios, i.e. lower fodder availability or higher fodder requirements of livestock due to climate and altitude effects, increased the area with unsustainable grazing practices to 50%. The presented approach enables an in-depth evaluation of the carrying capacity and corresponding management actions.

Predicted climate conditions and cover crop composition modify weed communities in semiarid agroecosystems	WEED RESEARCH												The US Northern Great Plains is one of the largest expanses of small grain agriculture, but excessive reliance on off-farms inputs and predicted warmer and drier conditions hinder its agricultural sustainability. In this region, the use of cover crops represents a promising approach to increase biodiversity and reduce external inputs; however little information exists about how cover crop mixture composition, predicted climate and management systems could impact the performance of cover crops and weed communities. In the 4th cycle of a cover crop-wheat rotation, we experimentally increased temperature and reduced moisture as expected to occur with climate change, and assessed impacts on the presence and composition of cover crop mixtures and termination methods on weed communities. Under ambient climate conditions, mean total cover crop biomass was 43%-53% greater in a five species early-season cover crop mixture compared with a seven species mid-season mixture, and differences were less pronounced in warmer and drier conditions (19%-24%). We observed a total of 18 weed species; 13 occurring in the early-season mixture, 13 in the mid-season mixtures and 14 in the fallow treatments. Weed species richness and diversity was lower in warmer and drier treatments, and we observed a shift in weed communities due to the presence and composition of cover crop mixtures as well as climate manipulations. Overall, results suggest that adoption of cover crop mixtures in semiarid agroecosystems requires jointly addressing weed management and soil moisture retention goals, a challenge further complicated by predicted climate conditions.

A factorial arrangement based on a randomized complete block design composed of three factors was carried out with three independent replications. Upland and wetland rice varieties were grown with three fertilizer treatments; the optimum N rate (86 kg N ha(-1)) without Zn application, the optimum N rate with Zn (50 kg ZnSO(4)ha(-1)), and the high N rate (172 kg N ha(-1)) with Zn under waterlogged and well-drained conditions. Grain yield was 27% lower in the well-drained than in the waterlogged condition in wetland rice, while there was no effect in upland rice. Application of optimum N with Zn application produced the highest grain yield in upland rice, while yield was the highest in wetland rice in high N with Zn application. Upland rice grown in the well-drained condition with the optimum and high N with Zn treatments enhanced Zn concentration by 45% and 29% higher than the treatment without Zn, respectively, while it had no difference among three treatments in the waterlogged condition. Wetland rice variety grown under the well-drained condition in optimum and high N rate with Zn treatments were equally effective in improving grain Zn concentration at the average of 88% compared to the control. While rice grown under the waterlogged condition in the high N with Zn treatment had improved 92% the concentration. The optimum N rate with Zn application increased grain yield in upland rice, while the higher N input is required for wetland rice. Grain Zn concentrations of upland and wetland rice varieties were enhanced by applying Zn fertilizer; however, the increased level was depended on N application rate in the individual water condition.

In sandy ecosystems, the formation of a plant litter crust plays a crucial role in the process of restoration. This research explored the influence of the plant litter crust on sandy soil properties and the bacterial community, and the effect of the bacterial taxa on soil functions through driving sandy soil nutrients cycling and multienzyme activities. Our study focused on a range of litter crust ages and depths and used high-throughput sequencing of the V4-V5rRNA gene region. Our results show that the composition and diversity of bacterial communities in the plant litter crust relate to litter crust depth especially in the top sandy soil layer. We found strong correlations between soil bacterial community composition and most soil properties. Further analysis showed that Chloroflexi was important in the nutrients cycling and enzyme activities; Proteobacteria contribute to the cycling of most nutrients; Firmicutes contribute to most enzyme activities during the formation of plant litter crust in sandy ecosystems. In summary, our findings provide evidence that plant litter has significant positive impacts on soil functioning within dryland ecosystems through the contribution of bacterial taxa to soil nutrients cycling and multiple enzyme activities. The study further underlines the roles of plant litter in sandy ecosystems and the importance of sandy soil properties and microbial communities in sandy plant litter crust formation and function.

The results showed that dryland soil was a weak net CH4 sink. The CH4 concentration and diffusion decreased with increasing depth to a depth of 50 cm, and then remained low from 50 to 100 cm. Much of the soil CH4 diffusion and transformation occurred in the top 20 cm, but maximum CH4 production occurred at a depth of 7 cm, and maximum CH4 consumption occurred at a depth of 15 cm. Soil moisture could significantly inhibit gas diffusion and accelerate the biochemical transformation of CH4. In high-yield production system, the application of nitrogen fertilizer promoted CH4 diffusion, especially in the surface soil, but did not affect the transformation of CH4; thus, organic matter promoted CH4 diffusion and stimulated CH4 transformation, especially for CH4 consumption at a depth of 15 cm. Overall, the integrated application of manure and nitrogen fertilizer can not only have optimum yield, but also successfully play a very low risk of CH4 emission.																			0167-8809	1873-2305				JAN 1	2020	287								106679	10.1016/j.agee.2019.106679	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2019.106679													WOS:000500216600004

This environment may cause a health disorder called acute mountain sickness (AMS). To improve the safety of expedition members, we evaluated the impact of extreme environmental conditions on human health and the effectiveness of monitoring of hypoxia for the early detection of AMS. Methods In total, 9 members from JARE 59 were studied. Dome Fuji Station (Dome F), located 3,810 m above sea level (ASL), was the destination of the research party. We analyzed daily AMS scores (higher values correspond to more severe AMS-related symptoms), physiological findings, and percutaneous arterial blood oxygen saturation (Sp02) during the inland activity. We also determined the factors related to AMS scores. Results The average AMS score on arrival at Dome F was significantly higher than that at the departure point (560 m ASL). The average Sp02 level was significantly lower than that at other points. The Sp02 level correlated negatively with the AMS score in Spearman's rank correlation. Generalized estimating equations analysis showed that the AMS score was negatively associated with Sp02 level and positively associated with age. Conclusion Hypoxia is a contributory factor to AMS which we can easily assess by measuring the Sp02 level with a pulse oximeter. Sp02 monitoring is a potentially useful health management tool for members in inland Antarctic expeditions. In addition, our results are helpful for understanding physiological responses and health issues in extreme environments.

Plant growth and biocrust-fire interactions across five North American deserts	GEODERMA												Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are communities predominately comprised of lichens, bryophytes, fungi, algae, and cyanobacteria that form at the soil surface in dryland ecosystems worldwide. Biocrusts can influence the vascular plant community by altering surface hydrology, nutrient cycling, and the availability of microsites suitable for germination. Fire frequency has increased in many dryland systems, but the potential impacts of fire on biocrust-plant interactions remains unclear. Our study explores how biocrusts and the heating associated with fire affect plant growth across five North American desert sites: the Chihuahuan, Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, Mojave, and Sonoran. Using field-collected biocrusts and mineral soil samples from each of these five deserts, we investigated soil biogeochemical differences and the implications of soil heating and biocrust cover on green-house grown Elymus elymoides plants. Results showed plant biomass and leaf production were largely determined by the desert where soils originated, and that the soils collected from the Great Basin site, whether heated or not, were generally higher in nutrients and distinct from the other North American desert sites. In contrast, the Chihuahuan site was lower in nutrients and plant biomass growth compared with the other desert sites. In the short term, biocrusts and heating did not significantly affect the biogeochemical profile of individual desert site soils. However, biocrusts and soil heating positively influenced plant growth, and the combination of these factors influenced plants more strongly than either factor considered separately. These findings highlight the importance of biocrusts in mediating resources and suggest additional mechanisms through which fire may alter or accentuate dynamics between biocrusts and vascular plants.

The diversification of large-scale farms can increase profits, resilience, and deliver sustainability outputs.OBJECTIVE: To (a) propose a farm diversification framework specifically designed for large-scale commercial farms; and (b) demonstrate its application to assess the benefits and trade-offs associated with alternative diversification options for a case-study farm in Northern Queensland, Australia.METHODS: A literature review and discussions with large-scale commercial farmers, a Natural Resource Man-agement NGO, and a regional council were used to co-design our framework. The framework was then used to guide discussions with a case-study farmer and conduct a participatory modelling exercise on alternative cropping-based diversification scenarios. We used a simulation model to produce quantitative information on the present and co-designed alternative scenarios, to iteratively inform discussions with the participating case-study farmer. The simulated scenarios included (i) the current system of dryland (non-irrigated) monocropping of cotton, (ii) a dryland cotton-maize rotation, (iii) an irrigated cotton-maize rotation, and (iv) an irrigated maize-mungbean-cotton rotation. The benefits and trade-offs of each scenario were assessed across five performance measures: downside risk, profit, water-use efficiency, ground cover and, from the discussion with the partici-pating farmer, the skills needed to de-risk the diversification process.RESULTS: Results from the co-designed scenarios showed that adding dryland maize as a rotation crop can reduce downside risks by 12.5% and increase fractional ground cover by more than two-fold, i.e., from 20% to >40%, compared to the current system. The use of irrigation in the cropping system increased the median gross margin by $2000 ha-1 and reduced downside risks to zero. The water-use efficiencies of the proposed irrigated scenarios were similar. Farmers reported that developing skills in irrigated cropping could increase their capacity to dynamically chose more profitable crops to sow with certainty of higher returns, but it would require up-front investments in terms of money and time.SIGNIFICANCE: Our proposed framework can be used to assess benefits and trade-offs of alternative farm diversification options across a range of performance dimensions (risk; profit; resource-use efficiency; skills). These assessments will ensure that the co-designed options are evaluated across multiple dimensions, all within the local context of the study and farmers' preference(s) and circumstances. The use of a co-design approach can be expected to increase learnings for all those involved and increase the chances of practice change and adoption.

Early on, concerns grew that lockdowns and travel restrictions could have severe consequences, especially for marginalized communities in the Global South. In Sub-Saharan Africa, wood charcoal is not only an important cooking fuel, but provides income for many rural households. Despite its economic value, the charcoal sector is, however, largely unregulated and viewed exclusively as an environmentally damaging industry by policy makers and the public who make it responsible for large-scale deforestation. The present study employs a sustainable livelihood framework to assess the ability of charcoal producers in northwestern Kenya, to cope with a short-term shock such as the COVID-19 pandemic and preventive measures. It furthermore compares their access to health information to that of non-producers. A street survey of 139 respondents allowed to gain rapid insights into the realities of a group not accessible via online or telephone surveys. The results show that 87% of charcoal producers face severe decline of this economic practice because of limited market access. These losses cause them food insecurities, while non-charcoal producers are more worried about social consequences of the restrictions. Though charcoal producers and non-producers feel equally well informed about the pandemic, producers are less likely to access reliable information channels than non-producers, resulting in an uneven distribution of health information across the community. By investigating the response of producers to an external shock and limited market access this study adds to the understanding of local vulnerabilities and the sustainability of rural livelihood strategies. This research argues for inclusive policy response to ensure consideration of the informal sector in crisis response as well as to provide adequate and low-threshold access to health information.

However, these regions are experiencing extreme climatic changes, and the impact of these projects are unclear. To gain a better understanding of the effectiveness of these projects, we employed water use efficiency (WUE), the ratio of gross primary production (GPP) to terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET), to predict future dryland ecosystem dynamics, and detected the underlying causes of WUE changes. We analysed the WUE trends and the decomposed components of WUE, namely the GPP to plant transportation ratio (GPP/T) and the plant transportation to terrestrial evapotranspiration (T/ET) ratio, between 2003 and 2018 in China's drylands. The results indicated that 70.3 % of the study area had an upward WUE trend, and T/ET was the dominant factor of the WUE trend in 74.9 % of the areas investigated. Furthermore, the increase in T/ET was associated with growth in leaf area index (LAI). The rising WUE rate in the vegetation restoration project areas was significantly higher than that in other areas along with the drought gradient (P < 0.05), which indicated WUE increasing was strongly influenced by the increase in LAI resulting from vegetation restoration. Thus, our research affirms that vegetation restoration greatly influences WUE increase. However, over time, WUE in these restored drylands is likely to decrease due to increased VPD and plantation saturation, so future strategies for vegetation restoration in drylands are therefore required.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2022	145								109703	10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109703	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109703													WOS:000991642700002

Potential for Sugarcane Production Under Current and Future Climates in South Africa: Sugar and Ethanol Yields, and Crop Water Use	SUGAR TECH												Spatial information on crop productivity and resource use is required to enable efficient sugarcane production with limited resources and under a changing climate. The objective of this study was to estimate biomass, sugar and ethanol yields for high-sucrose (HS) and high-fibre (HF) sugarcane cultivars for current and future climate in water limited South Africa. An upgraded version of the Canegro sugarcane model, calibrated for a HS and HF cultivar, was used to simulate biomass component yields for 1,986 agroclimatic zones. Ethanol yields were calculated from simulated biomass fractions and theoretical conversion efficiencies. Historical daily weather data for 1971-1990 were used to represent the baseline climate, while daily weather data generated from three global circulation models for 1971-1990 and 2046-2065 were used to project future changes in climate. Simulations show that the HF cultivar produced higher (15-35%) biomass and ethanol yields than the HS cultivar, but also used slightly more (similar to 4%) water. Climate change is projected to increase dryland yields for both cultivar types (8-19%) Irrigated yields will not change much in current high potential areas (1-5%), given adequate water supply, while yields could increase substantially in current cool areas (similar to 20%). Water and irrigation requirements are expected to increase (9-15%) under a future climate. New areas could be become suitable for irrigated and dryland production. The information produced in this study can be used to assist decision-making for: (1) optimizing production and processing processes and (2) the development of sustainable greenfield projects in marginal areas of South Africa.																			0972-1525	0974-0740				2022 DEC 19	2022										10.1007/s12355-022-01237-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12355-022-01237-y		DEC 2022											WOS:000900788300003

Three thousand years of farming strategies in central Thailand	ANTIQUITY												In prehistoric coastal and western-central Thailand, rice was the dominant cultivar. In eastern-central Thailand, however, the first known farmers cultivated millet. Using one of the largest collections of archaeobotanical material in Southeast Asia, this article examines how cropping systems were adapted as domesticates were introduced into eastern-central Thailand. The authors argue that millet reached the region first, to be progressively replaced by rice, possibly due to climatic pressures. But despite the increasing importance of rice, dryland, rain-fed cultivation persisted throughout ancient central Thailand, a result that contributes to refining understanding of the development of farming in Southeast Asia.

The experiment was conducted over two growth cycles using a split-plot design with three replication treatments, with I arranged in the main plots and N in the subplots.Results: Results indicated that irrigation amount, nitrogen application level, and their interaction significantly affected soil salt accumulation, cotton shoot biomass and yield, cotton nitrogen uptake (NU), nitrogen partial factor productivity (NPFP), and water productivity (WP). Additionally, the main effect year had a significant effect on all study variables, with higher values observed in 2017 compared to 2016, except for soil salt accumulation. The highest cotton shoot biomass, yield, NU, and WP as well as the lowest soil salt accumulation in mulched strips were both obtained in the I2N2 treatment.Conclusion: This treatment can be an optimal water and nitrogen management strategy for the cotton planting system under mulched drip irrigation and is crucial for achieving water and fertilizer savings in dryland conditions with brackish water irrigation.																			0378-4290	1872-6852				OCT 15	2023	302								109097	10.1016/j.fcr.2023.109097	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2023.109097		AUG 2023											WOS:001060196600001

SELECTION OF SUPERIOR GENOTYPES FOR SUPPLEMENTARY IRRIGATED AND RAIN FED ENVIRONMENTS FOR DURUM WHEAT (TRITICUM TURGIDUMSSP. DURUMDESF.) IN SOUTH-EAST TURKEY	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												This research aimed to select the best cultivars for both supplementary irrigated and rain fed conditions. A group of 17 recently released cultivars were tested employing randomized complete block design with three replications under supplementary irrigation and rain fed conditions at Sanliurfa and in Adiyaman locations in 2019-20. Grain yield with five agro-morphological and six quality traits were scored. Results indicated that entries differed for all traits under study. Index selection based on rank sums of all traits showed that durum wheat cultivars of Sumerli (1st), Artuklu (2nd), Zuhre (3th), Perre (4th), and Saricanak-98 (5th) ranked at first five place for both conditions. Spearman's average rank coefficient of correlation between ranks of sums of all traits for supplementary irrigation vs. rain fed condition was 73.52%. This was only 56.8% for grain yields for supplementary irrigation vs. rain fed condition. Mean yield (7,256.26 kg. ha-1) of supplementary irrigation was higher than that of (5,097.56 kg. ha-1) rain fed condition by 42.34%. It was concluded that genotypes 8 (Sumerli), 7 (Artuklu), and 3 (Zuhre) perform well in both environments and may be used directly in irrigated or in rain fed conditions in the studied locations. Furthermore, high performing varieties for both supplementary irrigation and rain fed conditions can be picked up better by index selection. This must be referred for better variety selection in breeding programs.

Autoclaved citrate-extractable protein as a soil health indicator relates to soil properties and crop production	NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS												Nitrogen is an important and limiting nutrient for crop production, but its role as a soil health indicator relating to most soil properties and crop production needs further exploration. Our objectives were to examine the sensitivity of soil N fractions to management practices and their relationships to 60 soil physical, chemical, biological, and biochemical properties and mean crop yields in two long-term (14- and 36-year-old) experiments under dryland cropping systems in the northern Great Plains, USA. Nitrogen fractions were soil total N (STN), potential N mineralization (PNM), water-extractable N (WEN), autoclaved citrate-extractable protein (ACEP), NH4-N, and NO3-N. Management practices were no-till and tilled crop rotations of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), pea (Pisum sativum L.), and fallow with and without N fertilization. Soil properties were analyzed from samples collected before farm operations in April 2019 and crop yields determined. Nitrogen fractions, except NH4-N and NO3-N, were greater with continuous cropping than crop-fallow. A principal component analysis (PCA) showed that PNM and ACEP were associated with most soil properties, followed by STN, WEN, NO3-N, and NH4-N. PNM, ACEP, and STN were more strongly related to mean crop yields across years in coarse- than medium-textured soil and other N fractions were weakly related. Because of its sensitivity to management practices, stronger relationships to most soil properties and crop yields, and rapid measurement, ACEP may be used as a promising N indicator of soil health in coarse- than medium-textured soil in dryland cropping systems in semiarid regions.

J	King, K; Li, H; Kang, JL; Lu, CF				King, Kevin; Li, Huang; Kang, Jinling; Lu, Chaofu			Mapping quantitative trait loci for seed traits in <i>Camelina sativa</i>	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS												Key message Genetic dissection of oil content and seed size in Camelina sativa was conducted by QTL mapping using a SNP-based linkage map and a recombinant inbred population. Camelina (Camelina sativa L. Crantz) is an oilseed crop that has great potential to provide sustainable feedstock for biofuel production and to improve dryland agriculture. A major breeding objective for camelina is to increase seed size and oil content. Understanding the genetics behind variations of seed size and associated traits such as oil content would help breeders develop varieties of increased oil yield that are more robust, easier to plant and harvest, and better for oil processing. In this study, we developed a recombinant inbred population derived from the two camelina accessions, Suneson and Pryzeth, with contrasting traits, especially seed size and oil content. Using 189 lines, a genetic map was constructed containing 2376 single nucleotide polymorphism markers spanning 2034.6 cM of 20 linkage groups with an average density of 1.5 cM per locus. Field trials were conducted for 2 years (2017 and 2018) in two environments (dryland and irrigated) in Bozeman, Montana. The results revealed important correlations of seed size with other associated traits such as oil content, pod size and seed number per pod. Significant QTLs were also discovered for these traits. The results of this study are the first step to isolate genes controlling seed development and oil accumulation and to develop advanced varieties of camelina better adapted to modern agriculture by marker-assisted breeding.

H.; Nadal-Romero, Estela			The enhancing effect of afforestation over secondary succession on soil quality under semiarid climate conditions	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Semiarid climate conditions hamper natural re-vegetation, leaving the soil vulnerable to erosion after the cessation of agriculture. Therefore, soil and landscape protective measures, especially afforestations, have been implemented in the Mediterranean region since the early 20th century. This study aims to determine the long term impact of afforestation on soil functioning, in comparison with natural re-vegetation (secondary succession) on abandoned fields and semi-natural vegetation. A comparison of secondary succession and afforestation with the present traditional rain fed cereal fields and semi-natural (open) forest, including natural resource islands, was made as well. Composite soil samples were taken to study the physical (i.e. texture, aggregate stability) and chemical (i.e. carbon content, nutrient availability) soil characteristics after 20 and 40 years of afforestation and secondary natural succession. To take into account the resource island effect, the spatial heterogeneity induced by differences in plant cover, samples were taken both below and in between the tree canopy of the semi-natural and afforested Pinus halepensis trees. Our results indicate that under secondary succession on abandoned fields, soil quality improves non-linearly and only marginally over a time of 40 years. The afforestation showed a much more pronounced linear increase for most soil quality indicators, resulting in soil conditions comparable to what can be found under the semi-natural forest vegetation. Site preparation might have been a crucial factor for the success of ecosystem restoration in the studied dry land area as it improved water availability for the afforestation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, due to large uncertainties in spatial climate datasets, the impacts of climate change and rising CO2 on net primary productivity (NPP) in Xinjiang have remained unclear. These uncertainties in climate will inevitably lead to uncertainties in model estimated NPP in Xinjiang. The uncertainties can be assessed by running an Arid Ecosystem Model (AEM) using multiple climate datasets. Such an approach allows to disentangle the relative contributions of individual climate factors on NPP change using numerical simulations and factorial analysis. The average annual NPP for Xinjiang from 2000 to 2014 was 155.90 +/- 2.74 g.C/(m(2).year), 189.99 +/- 1.80 g.C/(m(2).year), 213.04 +/- 8.93 g.C/(m(2).year) by using the MERRA, ERA-Interim and CFSR datasets respectively to drive AEM. Our multiple simulations show a consistent temporal pattern of the regional NPP during 2000-2014 that increased during 2008-2011, and decreased during 2005-2006 and 2013-2014. However, we found large uncertainties in the spatial pattern of NPP change during this time, particularly in the Taklimakan Desert and northern Xinjiang (except for the Tacheng where NPP increased). All simulations indicated that areas surrounding the Taklamakan Desert and ecosystems at high latitude ( > 47 degrees) and northwestern Xinjiang were dominated by precipitation change. However, there are large uncertainties in the dominant climate driver in other areas. To assess uncertainties in ecosystem NPP assessment, efforts should be made to improve the confidence in climate data in the northern Xinjiang. This can be achieved by establishing more rain gauges.																			0304-3800	1872-7026				SEP 15	2019	408								108742	10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.108742	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.108742													WOS:000480664800002

Potential natural vegetation (PNV) is widely used to provide a reference for the appropriate location and vegetation type of restoration programs while the appropriate restored areas remain unknown. Therefore, we proposed a PNV-potential normalized difference vegetation index (PNDVI) coupling framework based on multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms for precise dryland vegetation restoration. Taking the lower Tarim River Basin (LTRB) with a total area of 1,182 km(2) as a case study, its present suitable restoration locations, area, and appropriate planting species were quantitatively estimated. The results showed that the model developed by incorporating PNDVI into PNV with easily measurable and available data such as temperature and soil properties can accurately identify dryland restoration patterns. In LTRB, the potentially suitable habitats of trees and grass are closer to the riverbank, while shrubby habitats are further away from the course, covering 1.88, 2.96, and 25.12 km(2), respectively. There is still enormous land potential for further expansion of the current trees and grass in the LTRB, with 2.56 and 1.54% of existing land supposed to be trees and grass, respectively. This study's novel aspect is combining PNV and PNDVI to quantify and estimate precise restoration patterns through multiple ML algorithms. The model developed here can be used to evaluate the suitable reforestation locations, area, and vegetation types in drylands and to provide a basis for precise vegetation restoration.					.., What/IXW-6776-2023	Gui, Dongwei/0000-0002-2247-4325													1061-2971	1526-100X				2023 JUL 5	2023										10.1111/rec.13967	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.13967		JUL 2023											WOS:001023593100001

Here the data about WETs are scant, and WETs status is unexplained under the rampant habitat degradation. Use forms, plant parts used, status, ethnobotanical knowledge, conservation needs as well as those threats affecting WETs were reviewed. The study identified 88 indigenous wild edible plants, of which 52 species were WETs. In most cases, fruits were found as the dominant use part, and they were used as raw but were occasionally cooked and preserved. Roots and bark uses are also reported from Ximenia americana and Racosperma melanoxylon respectively. June, July and August were critical periods observed for food shortage in most of the regions. However, in the Gambella region, food shortages occurred in most months of the year. The respondents in this region suggested that WETs could potentially provide them with enough food to make up for the shortage of food from conventional agricultural crops. From the respondents' perception, Opuntia ficus-indica, Carissa edulis and Ficus vasta were among the most difficult to locate species, and they also received the highest conservation attention. Because of the variety of WETs and existing different threats, a management strategy is required for future conservation, as WETs are vital for the livelihood of local communities and are also necessary to devise a food security strategy for Ethiopia. The lesson obtained could also be useful in other dryland parts in developing countries with similar contexts.

J	Hooke, J				Hooke, Janet			Flood impacts on vegetation and hydraulics in ephemeral channels and dynamics of recovery	JOURNAL OF ECOHYDRAULICS												Vegetation can have a particularly strong effect on hydraulics and processes in dryland, ephemeral channels, where plants often occupy the channel bed. To understand the hydraulics, feedback effects and ecological dynamics for use in modelling and management, data on flow effects and vegetation dynamics are needed. Evidence from sites in southeast Spain, monitored for decades, is analysed here in relation to an extreme flood in September 2012 to identify thresholds for damage and destruction of plants, to assess rates of recovery, and to quantify effects of varying vegetation density and height on channel hydraulics. Repeated quadrat measurements provide data on vegetation cover, health and heights of plants, and were analysed in relation to measured flow stage and cross-section topographic surveys before, after and since the 2012 flood. Much of the vegetation was destroyed in the flood event, including the dominant Retama, resetting the vegetation. Threshold levels of shear stress for mortality and removal of the plants have been calculated. Rates of recovery have varied spatially, with little regrowth in main channels or on elevated floodplains, but strong growth occurring on bars. The different degrees of vegetation cover and height are calculated to have a very large effect on the flow hydraulics. The results support the proposal that dense vegetation cover can be highly effective in channel management by slowing flow, reducing erosion and increasing sedimentation.

Compost inputs, cropping system, and rotation phase drive aggregate-associated carbon	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												In the central Great Plains of North America, winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is often rotated with fallow periods. Tillage and the reduced return of C inputs have led to extensive soil degradation and loss of soil organic matter. Composted beef manure has the potential to restore soil organic matter and soil function. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of compost application rate and grain vs. forage rotations on soil structure and aggregate-associated C stabilization. The study assessed two dryland rotations of wheat-fallow and triticale (xTriticosecale Wittm. ex A. Camus)/pea (Pisum sativum L.)-fallow, and three compost rates: a control with nothing added (0x), 22.9 t ha(-1) (1x), and 108.7 t ha(-1) (5x) applied every 2 yr. After 8 yr, total C inputs were positively correlated with total soil organic C, the proportion of macroaggregates in the whole soil, and the mean weight diameter of soil aggregates. The increased C storage in macroaggregates was associated with an increase in the particulate organic matter and microaggregates within macroaggregates. Soils receiving the 5x compost rate had increased mid-infrared absorbance at the amide II band, in agreement with the decreased soil C/N ratio. Aggregate fractions of the wheat-based system tended to be more enriched in C than those of the forage-based rotation. Additionally, soil coming out of fallow tended to have aggregate fractions that were depleted in soil C. Our findings indicate that compost can improve soil structure and aggregate-associated C stabilization in dryland agroecosystems, whereas cropping system and rotation phase are also important to consider in the long-term management of SOM.

J	Morcillo, L; Bautista, S				Morcillo, Luna; Bautista, Susana			Interacting water, nutrients, and shrub age control steppe grass-on-shrub competition: Implications for restoration	ECOSPHERE												Understanding the factors that control grass-shrub interactions and coexistence is critical to the design of dryland management and restoration strategies. Using Stipa tenacissima tussocks as adult neighbor and Olea europaea var. sylvestris as target woody species, we performed a 5-year-long, large-scale manipulative experiment to investigate the independent and combined effects of water and nutrient availability, and the modulating effects of O. europaea ontogeny on the net outcome of grass-shrub interaction. At two contrasting dryland sites, we conducted experimental plantings of Olea seedlings on two microsites: contiguous to a Stipa tussock (Stipa microsite) and on the intertussock bare-soil areas (Open microsite), and manipulated resource availability by combining nutrient and water addition. The experiment followed a full factorial design, with all treatment combinations applied at each site. We monitored survival, height, and stem basal diameter of Olea individuals over a study period of 5 years. All across the wide range of conditions considered, negative effects of Stipa on Olea largely prevailed during the first 2 years after the plantation. We found that competition was stronger in the drier steppe, where extra inputs of water favored neutral interactions. Conversely, nutrient addition increased competition strength, particularly when combined with water inputs, pointing to the contrasting role of different resources and the importance of interactions between them in the control of plant-plant interaction outcome. The competition effects of Stipa faded with time and gradually shifted to neutral interaction as Olea individuals aged. Our results are particularly relevant to guide restoration efforts in formerly wooded xeric grasslands and rangelands.

In this study, the Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Standardized Precipitation and Evaporation Index (SPEI) were employed to quantify the resistance of ecosystem productivity to drought events in drylands of northern China between 1982 and 2015. The relationships and temporal trends of resistance and drought characteristics, which included length, severity, and interval, were examined. The temporal trends of resistance responded greatest to those of drought length, and drought length was the most sensitive and had the strongest negative effect with respect to resistance. Resistance decreased with increasing drought length and did not recover with decreasing drought length in hyper-arid regions after 2004, but did recover in arid and semi-arid regions from 2004 and in dry sub-humid regions from 1997. We reason that the regional differences in resistance may result from the seed bank and compensatory effects of plant species under drought events. In particular, this study implies that the ecosystem productivity of hyper-arid regions is the most vulnerable to drought events, and the drought-resistance and drought-recovery interactions are likely to respond abnormally or even shift under ongoing drought change.

These non-forest trees have a crucial role in biodiversity, and provide ecosystem services such as carbon storage, food resources and shelter for humans and animals(1,2). However, most public interest relating to trees is devoted to forests, and trees outside of forests are not well-documented(3). Here we map the crown size of each tree more than 3 m(2) in size over a land area that spans 1.3 million km(2) in the West African Sahara, Sahel and sub-humid zone, using submetre-resolution satellite imagery and deep learning(4). We detected over 1.8 billion individual trees (13.4 trees per hectare), with a median crown size of 12 m(2), along a rainfall gradient from 0 to 1,000 mm per year. The canopy cover increases from 0.1% (0.7 trees per hectare) in hyper-arid areas, through 1.6% (9.9 trees per hectare) in arid and 5.6% (30.1 trees per hectare) in semi-arid zones, to 13.3% (47 trees per hectare) in sub-humid areas. Although the overall canopy cover is low, the relatively high density of isolated trees challenges prevailing narratives about dryland desertification(5-7), and even the desert shows a surprisingly high tree density. Our assessment suggests a way to monitor trees outside of forests globally, and to explore their role in mitigating degradation, climate change and poverty.

However, the interaction of this management practice on cereal crop growth and environment factors is not clearly understood. Based on a three rotation cycles field experiment from 2013 to 2016, this study, based on the logistic equation, tried to quantify the impacts of continuous plastic mulching (PM) on the crop growth dynamics in a winter wheat (Triticwn aestivum L.) and summer maize (Zea mays L.) rotation system on the Loess Plateau, northwest China. The results showed that the logistic equation did well in the characterization of wheat and maize growth dynamics with its characteristic parameter (e.g., inflection points). Both in wheat and maize growth seasons, the plant height accumulation occurred earlier than the aboveground biomass accumulation. In comparison to the crop growth under the non-mulched treatment, the acceleration effects of PM treatment on the crop growth continued to be enhanced when the apical meristem was underground. For wheat, the improved soil hydrothermal conditions under the PM treatment effectively accelerated the wheat leaves' appearance and the tiller nodes development, which increased the final spike number and grain yields. For maize, because of the greater radiation and water use efficiency during the maize growth seasons, the PM treatment increased the maize kernels per spike and the thousand-seed weight, and significantly improved maize yields. Attributable to improved soil hydrothermal conditions and beneficial interactions between the crop growth and the external environment, the PM treatment significantly improved crop production and increased resource use efficiency, which may greatly contribute to the sustainability of local dryland farming.					cheng, shu/IZE-4788-2023; zhao, ying/ISA-2502-2023	Zhao, Ying/0000-0003-0346-5631													0168-1923	1873-2240				JUN 15	2019	271						385	397		10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.03.013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.03.013													WOS:000468709200035

Using air thermal time to predict the time course of seedling emergence of <i>Avena sterilis</i> subsp. <i>sterilis</i> (sterile oat) under Mediterranean climate	AIMS AGRICULTURE AND FOOD												Avena sterilis subsp. sterilis (sterile oat) is a troublesome grass weed of winter cereals both in its native range encompassing the Mediterranean up to South Asia, and in regions of America, Northern Europe and Australia where it is introduced. A better understanding of seedling emergence patterns of this weed in cereal fields can help control at early growth stages benefiting efficacy under a changing climate. With this aim, the objective of this research was to develop and validate a field emergence model for this weed based on cumulative air thermal time (CTT, degrees C day). Experiments for model setting and evaluation were carried out in experimental and commercial fields in southern Spain. Two alternative models, Gompertz and Weibull, were compared for their ability to represent emergence time course. The Weibull model provided the best fit to the data. Evaluation through independent experiments showed good model performance in predicting seedling emergence. According to the developed model, the onset of emergence takes place at 130 CTT, and 50% and 90% emergence is achieved at 448 and 632 CTT, respectively. Results indicate that this model could be useful for growers as a tool for decision-making in A. sterilis control.

J	Zhang, P; Wei, T; Han, QF; Ren, XL; Jia, ZK				Zhang, Peng; Wei, Ting; Han, Qingfang; Ren, Xiaolong; Jia, Zhikuan			Effects of different film mulching methods on soil water productivity and maize yield in a semiarid area of China	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Film mulching has been used widely to improve field productivity in rainfed agricultural ecosystems in semiarid areas of China. During 2013-2016, we evaluated the effects of different film mulching methods on soil water, water productivity, crop yield, and economic benefits in a semiarid area of southern Ningxia, China. Five treatments were tested: (i) a control method consisting of conventional flat planting without mulching (CK); (ii) alternate mulching and bare rows without ridges and planting in mulched rows (P); (iii) maize planted in furrows separated by consecutive plastic film-mulched ridges (S); (iv) maize planted in furrows separated by alternating large and small plastic film-mulched ridges (D); and (v) maize, planted in furrows with large plastic film-mulched ridges alternating with flat plastic film-mulched spaces (R). After four years of continuous treatment, the results indicated that D and S treatments significantly increased soil water content at depths of 0-200 cm during the early growth stage, but the increases in the soil water content were lower later in the maize growth process. The grain yield increases were affected by the different hydrothermal conditions in various years. On average, mulching increased grain yield by 31.33 %, and biomass accumulation by 22.48 %. Across four seasons, film mulching significantly (P < 0.05) increased water use efficiency and precipitation use efficiency, especially in D by 34.56 % and 43.09 %, and S by 35.25 % and 42.79 %, respectively. Mulching changed the crop water consumption characteristics, and resulted in higher crop water productivity due to an improved hydro-thermal balance, especially during the vegetative (30-90 days) and pre-reproductive (90-120 days) growth stages, which may account for yield increase effects in this system. In addition, the results suggested that the mulching system achieves higher economic returns than CK, especially the S treatment (7538 (sic) ha(-1), representing an average of 29.19 % higher than CK.). The S treatment could serve as a promising adaptive management method for increasing maize productivity to cope with food security and climate change in this semi-arid area with limited and erratic precipitation.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				NOV 1	2020	241								106382	10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106382	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106382													WOS:000566861800001

However, this diversity impedes the efforts to characterize individual taxa and their ecological attributes. In particular, comprehensive assessments of soil bacterial communities in drylands in China are limited. In this study, soil samples were collected across 12 deserts, covering four climatic regions (dry sub-humid, semi-arid, arid and hyper-arid) in northern China to examine the dominant phylotypes, and their environmental preferences and functional traits. Only 3.2% of the bacterial phylotypes (913 phylotypes) were dominant. These dominant phylotypes can be grouped into six major ecological clusters based on high pH, high elevation, low aridity index, high aridity index, low mean annual temperature and low soil water content, each with multiple phyla. Based on the association between diversity indexes for dominant and subdominant phylotypes, these dominant bacteria might be the drivers or indicators of key soil processes across desert soils in northern China. Genes involved in carbon fixation and decomposition and nitrogen metabolism varied across desert soils, suggesting functional differences. These findings provide deeper insights into soil bacterial communities, which are critical for forecasting the ecological consequences of ongoing global environmental change and for a better mechanistic understanding of the biogeochemical cycle. Highlights 3.2% of the bacterial phylotypes were dominant across 12 deserts in northern China. The dominant phylotypes were grouped into six major ecological clusters. Carbon fixation, decomposition and nitrogen metabolism genes varied across desert soils. Some northern China desert soils might undergo nitrogen and carbon loss in the near future.

Three Soil Water Potential Strategies to Schedule Irrigation Events using S3DI in Cotton	JOURNAL OF COTTON SCIENCE												Scheduling irrigation events in the humid Southeast can be challenging due to unreliable rainfall patterns. The objective of this study was to evaluate three water potential strategies for scheduling irrigation events in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) using shallow subsurface drip irrigation (S3DI) with respect to lint yield and quality, irrigation water-use efficiency (IWUE), and value water-use efficiency (VWUE). Research was conducted in 2012 through 2016 in southwest Georgia, U.S. using an S3DI system. Water potential sensors were installed at 25- and 50-cm soil depth. Irrigation treatments and events occurred when the average water potential values were: -40 kPa (treatment I1), -70 kPa (treatment I2), -70/-40/-60 kPa (treatment I3) (emergence to 1st square/1st square to 1st cracked boll/1st cracked boll to defoliation) and a dryland control. All irrigated treatments had higher yield (1975 kg ha(-1)) than dryland (987 kg ha(-1)) except during 2013 (wet year). When 2013 data was deleted, there was no lint yield difference across years (p = 0.07) or across irrigation treatments (p = 0.06). Irrigation treatments I2 and I3 applied 170 mm less irrigation water compared to I1. There were differences in lint quality by irrigation treatment and year, but quality values were within acceptable ranges little or no price deductions. Dry year IWUE for treatments I2 and I3 averaged 3.1 kg lint mm(-1) compared with I1 at 2.2 kg lint mm(-1). For VWUE, both I2 and I3 had 44% greater value per unit of irrigation applied compared with I1. Either I2 or I3 can be used for scheduling irrigation events efficiently and economically.																			1523-6919	1524-3303					2019	23	1					14	20																WOS:000504897100003

There are few reports on the effects of biaxial rotary tillage on the carbon footprint (CF), energy budget, and net ecosystem economic efficiency (NEEB) of rice fields. Here, we evaluated the effects of dryland biaxial rotary tillage (DBRT), as well as two traditional tillage methods, dryland and paddy field in uniaxial rotary tillage (DPURT) and paddy field in uniaxial rotary tillage (PURT), on the CF, energy budget, and NEEB of rice production to clarify the economic and ecological utility of DBRT. The tillage depth was 9.5-15.4% higher under DBRT than under DPURT and PURT (p < 0.05). The soil bulk density was 5.4-12.1% lower under DBRT than under DPURT and PURT. The rice grain yield was 7.6-8.7% and 17.7-19.1% higher under DBRT than under DPURT and PURT, respectively (p < 0.05). The total global warming potential was 7.6-10.6% and 17.0-20.4% lower under DBRT than under DPURT and PURT, respectively (p < 0.05). The CF was 17.7-18.9% and 35.4-36.1% lower under DBRT than under DPURT and PURT, respectively. The energy use efficiency was 8.7-10.4% and 16.4-18.3% higher under DBRT than under DPURT and PURT, respectively. The NEEB were 13.2-15.7% and 28.6-32.1% higher under DBRT than under DPURT and PURT, respectively. In summary, DBRT is beneficial for increasing rice yield and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, thereby improving the economic and ecological benefits of rice.																				2571-581X				APR 25	2023	7								1169886	10.3389/fsufs.2023.1169886	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1169886													WOS:000983550700001

Despite continuous improvements, coupled climate models still have significant systematic errors in simulating AI in terms of temporal and spatial variabilities. One of the approaches to bias-correct simulations is extracting the linear relationship between historical observations and model outputs by utilizing the empirical orthogonal function (EOF). In this study, the methodology of ensemble EOF-based bias-correction by observational constraints is developed based on previous bias-correction approach, with the improvement on seeking the optimal combinations of the leading modes with sensitivity test and replacing the certain correction with the ensemble means of optimal members. In verification, the ensemble mean of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5-EM) is bias-corrected towards the CPC/GLDAS observations, and the extracted leading modes present high correlations with internal climate variability. By cross-validation and posteriori independent validation of hindcasts over the historical period (1948-2005), the ensemble EOF-based bias-correction could better present spatial patterns compared to the CMIP5-EM after systematic bias-correction, as indicated by the anomaly correlation and the root mean square error. The verifications also indicate that the temporal variability in aridity over different dryland regions is much closer to that in the observations and that the dryland subtype changes are improved significantly by bias-corrections. Besides, another observational dataset of UDel/CRU is applied to assess the uncertainty on different datasets and the improvement on skill scores is robust. The above results verify that the ensemble EOF-based bias-corrections provide better reference for assessing and projecting global aridity changes by climate models.

The coleoptile length determines the maximum depth that seeds can be sown, and it is critical for establishment of the crop. Therefore, identifying loci associated with coleoptile length in wheat is essential. In the present study, 282 accessions from Shanxi Province representing wheat breeding for the Loess Plateau were grown under three experimental conditions to study coleoptile length. The results of phenotypic variation indicated that drought stress and light stress could lead to shortening of coleoptile length. Under drought stress the growth rate of environmentally sensitive cultivars decreased more than insensitive cultivars. The broad-sense heritability (H-2) of BLUP (best linear unbiased prediction) under various conditions showed G x E interaction for coleoptile length but was mainly influenced by heredity. Correlation analysis showed that correlation between plant height-related traits and coleoptile length was significant in modern cultivars whereas it was not significant in landraces. A total of 45 significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) for coleoptile length in the three conditions were identified using the 3VmrMLM (3 Variance-component multi-locus random-SNP-effect Mixed Linear Model) and MLM (mixed linear model). In total, nine stable genetic loci were identified via 3VmrMLM under the three conditions, explaining 2.94-7.79% of phenotypic variation. Five loci on chromosome 2B, 3A, 3B, and 5B have not been reported previously. Six loci had additive effects toward increasing coleoptile length, three of which are novel. Molecular markers for the loci with additive effects on coleoptile length can be used to breed cultivars with long coleoptiles.																			1664-462X					SEP 21	2022	13								1016551	10.3389/fpls.2022.1016551	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.1016551								36212294					WOS:000864673900001

In this study, evapotranspiration based on soil water budget was investigated with respect to major influencing factors during the growing seasons of 2012-2015 for two adjacent forest communities in the semiarid Loess Plateau region: a natural secondary forest dominated by oak (Quercus liao-tungensis) and a plantation of exotic black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia). Based on the combination of precipi-tation, soil water storage, and evapotranspiration dynamics, four distinct periods were differentiated to explore the evapotranspiration response to the main meteorological factors. The correlation matrixes showed that, in most investigated days, evapotranspiration was limited by soil water storage, while an increase in soil water storage shifted dominance from water-related to energy-related factors. The stepwise regression of >= 5-day dry events in each period had a better fitness when paired with the relationship between the summations of evapotranspiration and dominant factors (R2 > 0.7, p < 0.01 for all) than the stepwise results for daily averages. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to validate the division and determine thresholds. All divisions were thoroughly validated, and the soil water storage thresholds of the black locust (120.2 mm and 150.7 mm) were higher than those of the oak (105.8 mm and 137.9 mm). Our results suggest that the oak had an adaptive water consumption strategy, while the black locust had a higher sensitivity to soil water insufficiency. The method for determining the threshold of soil water storage to separate the dominant factors of evapo-transpiration was validated. The approach may be applied to other semiarid forest communities with distinct evapotranspiration response patterns.

Plasticity of Leaf Hydraulic Conductance in Maize in Response to Varying Nitrogen and Water Supplies	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY												The availabilities of nitrogen (N) and water are two important environmental factors affecting crop growth and productivity in the dryland farming, how they affected leaf water transport capabilities, a bottleneck of whole-plant water transport, was seldom studied. So, the effects of different N and water supplies on leaf hydraulic conductance (K-leaf) in maize (Zea mays L.) were studied by a pot experiment, K-leaf, leaf gas exchange, vein traits and other physio-anatomical traits were measured. We found K-leaf was strongly coupled to leaf gas exchange (net photosynthetic rate, P-n, and stomatal conductance, g(s)) and whole-plant performance under varying N and water supplies. Long-term N supply had a greater impact than irrigation on K-leaf, P-n and g(s) due to the type and duration of stress, and the N and water treatments did not interact with these physiological parameters. K-leaf was related positively with the xylem conduit diameter of large longitudinal veins, the proportion of minor-vein length and interveinal distance of large and intermediate longitudinal veins, and negatively with the density of the major veins, and the interveinal distance of the transverse veins. The higher K-leaf under ambient N and water supply was also associated with larger leaf area, leaf mass per area and N content per leaf area and with an improved status of leaf water, which partly enhanced the vein traits responsible for the higher K-leaf. These results are helpful to understand leaf hydraulic strategy in adapting to long-term resource deficiency.																			1021-4437	1608-3407				JAN	2021	68	1					136	146		10.1134/S1021443721010192	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1021443721010192													WOS:000618210900014

Although soil mi-croorganisms play critical functional roles in nutrient capture and cycling within fertile islands, our understanding of polymicrobial community roles in regulating soil nutrient distribution in fertile islands remains limited. Herein, we aim to clarify the relationships between the complexity of soil microbial (bacterial, archaeal and fungal) communities and the nutrient distribution around fertile islands. Soil samples were collected along vertical profiles at varying depths in three patches under the canopy of Hedysarum scoparium (CENTRE), at the edge (EDGE) of the canopy and outside (OUTSIDE) the canopy in an area of flowing sand. All the three microbiota have showed spatial heterogeneity around the fertile islands. Among them, bacteria had the most significant heterogeneity, and bacterial community assembly was dominated by deterministic processes. Microbial interaction patterns also showed spatial heterogeneity among different patches. More interaction complexity within microbiota was found in the bacteria in the CENTRE patch and in the fungi in the OUTSIDE patch. In addition, the proportions of among-kingdom connections were reduced under the canopies. Bacteria had the highest connectivity and centrality in the polymicrobial networks and were the most important predictor of polymicrobial interaction complexity, which may have contributed to the distribution of soil nutrients. The random forest (RF) model provided evidence that bacterial beta-diversity and the polymicrobial network complexity index can be optimal predictors of the soil multinutrient cycling index. Our study highlighted the responses of bacteria and polymicrobial interactions to fertile islands and their importance in driving soil nutrient het-erogeneity. This information will help in managing soil microorganisms to provide dryland ecosystem services.					zhou, yang/JED-3951-2023														0048-9697	1879-1026				JAN 20	2023	857		1						159355	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159355	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159355		OCT 2022						36240927					WOS:000875703500002

Based on the in situ data from six flux sites in northwestern China from 2014 to 2016, this study compares seasonal and interannual dynamics of carbon fluxes between these arid and semi-arid ecosystems and the atmosphere. Meanwhile, the reliability of multiple remotely-derived GPP products in representative drylands was examined, including the Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and data derived from the OCO-2 solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (GOSIF). The results indicated that the carbon fluxes had clear seasonal patterns, with all ecosystems functioning as carbon sinks. The maize cropland had the highest GPP with 1183 g C m(-2)y(-1). Although the net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) in the Tamarix spp. ecosystem was the smallest among these flux sites, it reached 208 g C m(-2)y(-1). Furthermore, distinct advantages of GOSIF GPP (with R-2=0.85-0.98, and RMSE=0.87-2.66 g C m(-2)d(-1)) were found with good performance. However, large underestimations in three GPP products existed during the growing seasons, except in grassland ecosystems. The main reasons can be ascribed to the uncertainties in the key model parameters, including the underestimated light use efficiency of the MODIS GPP, the same coarse land cover product for the BESS and MODIS GPP, the coarse gridded meteorological data, and distribution of C-3 and C-4 plants. Therefore, it still requires more work to accurately quantify the GPP across these dryland ecosystems.

However, the evolution of soil-dwelling microorganisms along with reclamation and the potential influence of land-use patterns on them remain unclear. In this study, a soil chronosequence derived from Yangtze River sediments was established, comprising of circa 0, 60, 160, 280, 2000, and 3000 years, to examine the succession of soil bacterial communities across different land uses. Our analysis revealed obvious development in soil properties and orderly bacterial succession along reclamation gradients. Over time, reclaimed land suffered from varying degrees of abundance loss and biodiversity simplification, with dryland being the most sensitive to reclamation duration changes, whereas woodland and paddies showed slight reductions. Bacterial communities tended to shift from oligotrophs (K-strategist) to copiotrophs (rstrategist) at the phylum level as reclamation proceeded for all land use types. The relative abundance of certain bacterial functional groups associated with the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles were significantly increased, including those involved in Aerobic chemoheterotrophy, Chitinolysis, Nitrate reduction, Nitrate respiration, and Ureolysis, while other groups, such as those related to Fermentation, Methylotrophy, Nitrification, and Hydrocarbon degradation, exhibited decreased expression. Notably, prolonged reclamation can also trigger ecological issues in soil, including a continuous increase of predatory/exoparasitic bacteria in dryland and woodland, as well as a significant increase in pathogenic bacteria during the later stages in paddy fields. Overall, our study identified the impact of long-term reclamation on soil bacterial communities and functional groups, providing insight into the development of land-use-oriented ecological protection strategies.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				JAN 15	2024	908								168531	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168531	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168531		NOV 2023						37963526					WOS:001115383200001

At the same time, the majority of drylands are located in developing countries where high population densities and rapid population growth place additional pressure on the ecosystem. Thus, drylands are particularly vulnerable to environmental changes and large-scale environmental degradation. However, little is known about the long-term functional response of vegetation to such changes induced by the interplay of complex human-environmental interactions. Here we use time series of satellite data to show how vegetation productivity in relation to water availability, which is a major aspect of vegetation functioning in tropical drylands, has changed over the past two decades. In total, one-third of tropical dryland ecosystems show significant (P < 0.05) changes in vegetation-rainfall sensitivity with pronounced differences between regions and continents. We identify population as the main driver of negative changes, especially for developing countries. This is contrasted by positive changes in vegetation-rainfall sensitivity in richer countries, probably resulting from favourable climatic conditions and/or caused by an intensification and expansion of human land management. Our results highlight geographic and economic differences in the relationship between vegetation-rainfall sensitivity and associated drivers in tropical drylands, marking an important step towards the identification, understanding and mitigation of potential negative effects from a changing world on ecosystems and human well-being. Drylands are under pressure from climate change and population growth. This study finds the sensitivity of dryland vegetation to rainfall changing, with opposite effects in poorer and richer nations.

Our results indicated that herbicide 2,4-Dbe displayed the best inhibitory effect on nitrification, followed by puma and tribenuron-methyl, whereas the remaining five herbicides exhibited less effect when 10 mg of active ingredient (A.I.) of every herbicide per kg of soil was applied in vegetable-planting soil. The inhibition appeared when 5-100 mg of A.I. 2,4-Dbe was employed, which was enhanced with an increment in its dose in both vegetable-planting and fluvo-aquic soils. However, the inhibitory effect of 10 mg of A. I. 2,4-Dbe exhibited obvious differences in these two types of soils, where the duration of inhibition was shorter as it only continued about a week in fluvo-aquic and calcic cambisols soils with strong nitrification activity but poorer effect as compared to 10 mg of dicyandiamide (DCD). In contrast, the duration of inhibition exceeded 2 months in dryland red and shajiang black soils with a weak nitrification activity which was equivalent to DCD. In addition, comparing with five nitrification inhibitors, 10 mg of 2,4-Dbe had better inhibition than the substituted pyrimidine (AM) and sulfocarbamide (SU), but was equivalent to DCD, nitrapirin, and 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) at their recommended application rates in dryland red soil. These obtained data clearly indicated that 2,4-Dbe could play a stronger role as a nitrification inhibitor in soils.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				AUG 10	2019	230	8							198	10.1007/s11270-019-4253-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-019-4253-3													WOS:000480545300002

However, in recent years, due to climate change and human activities, its habitat area and distribution area have been decreasing sharply. In order to provide better protection for E. sinica, it is necessary to study the historical and future potential zoning of E. sinica. The maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) was used to simulate the potential geographical distribution patterns of E. sinica under historical and future climatic conditions simulated using two Shared Socio-economic Pathways. The main results were also analyzed using the jackknife method and ArcGIS. The results showed that: (1) the potential suitable distribution area of E. sinica in China is about 29.18 x 10(5) km(2)-high-suitable areas, medium-suitable areas, and low-suitable areas cover 6.38 x 10(5) km(2), 8.62 x 10(5) km(2), 14.18 x 10(5) km(2), respectively-and E. sinica is mainly distributed in Inner Mongolia; (2) precipitation and temperature contribute more to the distribution of E. sinica; (3) under two kinds of SSPs, the total suitable area of E. sinica increased significantly, but the differences between 2021-2040, 2041-2060, 2061-2080, and 2081-2100 are not obvious; (4) the barycentre of E. sinica moves from the historical position to its southwest. The results show that E. sinica can easily adapt to future climates well, and its ecological value will become more important. This study provides scientific guidance for the protection, management, renewal and maintenance of E. sinica.

This study determined the effect of seeding canola using precision planters (30.5 and 50.8 cm seeding row width) and conventional air drill seeders at different rates (20, 40, 60, 80, and 160 seeds m(-2)) on plant density and seed yield. The study was conducted for 4 yr (2016 to 2019) at three locations in southern Alberta. Plant density increased with higher seeding rates following the negative exponential function distribution. The yield-density relationship was non-linear asymptotic in nature and weak-to-moderate in strength at most site-years. The parameters of yield-density relationship did not show statistically significant differences among the air drill and precision planters. When averaged among seeding rates, canola yield was higher for the narrow row precision planter at 5 site-years and for the air drill at 2 site-years out of a total of 12 site-years. Under irrigated and high-precipitation conditions, seed yield in narrow-row precision planted canola was higher than air drill seeded canola. There was an average increase of 463 kg ha(-1) (10%) in the seed yield in narrow-row precision planted canola compared with the air drill seeded canola among irrigated systems; however, under water-limited conditions, seed yield in air drill seeded canola was comparable or higher than the precision planted canola. Wide-row planter led to poor crop establishment and seed yield under both irrigated and dryland conditions, attributed to higher in-row plant density due to wider row spacing.																			0008-4220	1918-1833				JUN	2022	102	3					698	709		10.1139/cjps-2020-0186	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjps-2020-0186		FEB 2022											WOS:000788314000001

Obsidian at Umm Qseir, a Halafian farmstead in the Syrian steppe	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS												Obsidian sourcing in the Near East was principally developed to investigate the Neolithic Revolution, but limitations of these early studies were soon recognized. Critics noted that sites included in the models span millennia and vary in size and function. Greater insight is offered by a more contextualized examination of the nature and timing of sites. Within the Neolithic sequence, one phase of considerable interest is the Halaf period (c. 6000-4500 BCE) in Northern Mesopotamia. The spread of Halaf "tradition," arguably the earliest example of a widely shared material culture in the region, has been tied to varied hypotheses of movement (of people, objects, and/or ideas) that remain largely untested. The use of obsidian sourcing to investigate Halafian phenomena (e.g., the spread of Halaf ceramics, the practice of dryland farming) would ideally involve high temporal resolution and consider settlement function and scale (e.g., an early urban center, a small farming village). Umm Qseir, the smallest known Halaf site, fulfills both. Occupied for less than two centuries, Umm Qseir was an environmentally marginal farmstead managed year-round by just two or three families at a time. The closest contemporary settlement was more than 30 km to the north, within the conventional limits of dryland farming (annual rainfall > 250 mm). Here we reconstruct and refine obsidian sourcing data for Umm Qseir artifacts from 1990s and 2000s studies, and we present new data for a small assemblage. We also highlight techno-typological clues that elucidate production, use, and maintenance of such artifacts. Ultimately, such findings offer insights into the exchange strategy of Syrian steppe farmsteaders and reflect an important means of risk management.

Genetic engineering has been successful in controlling harmful insects and conferring herbicide resistance, but has yet to produce similar results in reducing damages caused by abiotic stresses. It was previously shown that overexpression of AVP1 that encodes a vascular H+-pyrophosphatase in Arabidopsis could increase drought and salt tolerance and overexpression of RCA that encodes Rubisco activase in Larrea tridentata could increase heat tolerance in transgenic plants. It was therefore hypothesized that cooverexpression of AVP1 and RCA would make transgenic plants more tolerant to all three stresses simultaneously. Indeed, this hypothesis was confirmed in Arabidopsis. To test if this result could be duplicated in an actual crop, AVP1 and RCA were co-overexpressed in cotton. The results from this study indicated that RCA/AVP1 co-overexpressing cotton plants produced 50% and 96% higher seed fiber yield than wild-type cotton under combined drought and salt stresses and combined drought and heat stresses, respectively. Furthermore, RCA/AVP1 co-overexpressing cotton plants showed a 6.5-fold increase in net photosynthetic rates under heat stress as well as having much higher Vcmax rates under multiple stress conditions. Results from two field studies showed that RCA/AVP1 co-overexpressing cotton plants had 90% and 66-75% increase in seed fiber yield in comparing to wild-type cotton under dryland conditions. This study proves that cooverexpression of AVP1 and RCA can improve cotton's fiber yield in a dryland agricultural region, and this approach could increase other crops' yield in arid and semiarid regions of the world.

Influence of provenance origin on the early performance of two sclerophyllous Mediterranean species established in burned drylands	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Forest restoration have had limited success due to intense and prolonged droughts in Mediterranean-type ecosystems. In this context, knowledge of growth and physiology in seedlings of different provenances can be useful in the selection of appropriate seed sources for restoration. In this study we investigated variations in survival, growth, and leaf-level physiology of five provenances of Quillaja saponaria Mol. and five provenances of Cryptocarya alba Mol. originated from coastal and Pre Andean sites exhibiting latitudinal-related climate differences in central Chile. Seedlings were grown in a nursery on 600 mL pots for 18 months and then planted in a dryland site severely damaged by fire. One year after establishment, we measured survival, growth, and leaf-level physiology. We also analyzed the relationship between outplanting survival with seedling characteristics prior to planting, and the relationship between growth and survival with physiological traits and with climate variables. Growth and survival were similar among provenances of Q. saponaria and C. alba, with the exception of differing heights observed within the provenance of Q. saponaria. Initial root collar diameter of Q. saponaria was observed to be positively correlated to outplanting survival. With the exception of photosynthesis in Q. saponaria, all provenances of both species differed in the leaf-level physiological traits. Those provenances originating from interior dryland sites exhibited lower stomatal conductance and used water more efficiently. The opposite was true for provenances coming from coastal sites. In outplanting sites with Mediterranean-type climates that have been damage by severe fire, selections based on larger diameter seedlings, especially for Q. saponaria and from interior and pre-Andean provenances, will likely improve outplanting success.

Crust species and functions are, however, highly spatially heterogeneous and remain poorly understood at a range of scales. In this study, chlorophyll fluorescence imaging was used to quantify millimeter-scale patterns in the distribution and activity of photosynthetic organisms in BSCs of different successional stages (including cyanobacterial, lichen, moss three main successional stages and three intermixed transitional stages) from the Tengger Desert, China. Chlorophyll fluorescence images derived from the Imaging PAM (Pulse Amplitude Modulation) showed that with the succession from cyanobacterial to lichen and to moss crusts, crust photosynthetic efficiency (including the maximum and effective photosynthetic efficiency, respectively) and fluorescence coverage increased significantly (P < 0.05), and that increasing photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) reduced the effective photosynthetic efficiency (Yield). The distribution of photosynthetic organisms in crusts determined Fv/Fm (ratio of variable fluorescence to maximum fluorescence) frequency pattern, although the photosynthetic heterogeneity (SHI index) was not significantly different (P > 0.05) between cyanobacterial and moss crusts, and showed a unimodal pattern of Fv/Fm values. In contrast, photosynthetic heterogeneity was significantly higher in lichen, cyanobacteria-moss and lichen-moss crusts (P < 0.05), with a bimodal pattern of Fv/Fm values. Point pattern analysis showed that the distribution pattern of chlorophyll fluorescence varied at different spatial scales and also among the different crust types. These new results provide a detailed (millimeter-scale) insight into crust photosynthetic mechanisms and spatial distribution patterns associated with their community types. Collectively, this information provides an improved theoretical basis for crust maintenance and management in dryland regions.					; Tooth, Stephen/B-6105-2013	Thomas, Andrew/0000-0002-1360-1687; Tooth, Stephen/0000-0001-5714-2606; Lan, Shubin/0000-0001-8013-9755													0095-3628	1432-184X				NOV	2019	78	4					936	948		10.1007/s00248-019-01356-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-019-01356-0								30949750					WOS:000495294900014

The results of the study clearly indicated that the long-term use of tillage, application of residues and N levels had a significant effect on all the P fractions in soils, except that water-soluble phosphorus (WSP) was not significantly influenced by the tillage practices. The Tillage x Residue x Nitrogen (T x R x N) significantly influenced the reductant soluble phosphorus (RSP) and total phosphorus (TP); however, the remaining P fractions were not influenced significantly. Among the combination of soil management treatments, conventional tillage (CT)+ Gliricidia loppings @ 2 tha(-1) (GL) + N level @ 90 kg ha(-1) (N90) (CTGLN90) gave the highest sorghum grain yield (1432 kg ha(-1)) and P uptake (14.20 kg P ha(-1)). Among the treatment combinations, the order of superiority of treatments in terms of castor yield and P uptake was: CT+ sorghum stover @ 2t ha(-1) (SS) + N90 (CTSSN90) (1788 kg ha(-1), 11.94 kg P ha(-1)) > Minimum Tillage (MT) + sorghum stove @2 t ha(-1) (SS) + N level @ 90 kg ha(-1) (N90) (MTSSN90) (1761 kg ha(-1), 14.24 kg P ha(-1)), respectively. Significant coefficients of multiple determination obtained from regression equations developed between sorghum crop yield and P fractions (R-2 = 0.726, p = .05) and sorghum P uptake and P fractions (R-2 = 0.620, p = .05) highlighted the importance of these fractions in influencing the crop yield and P uptake. Similarly, castor yield (R-2 = 0.748, p = .05) and P uptake (R-2 = 0.783) were significantly influenced by the P fractions. The results of the present study will be useful in understanding the effect of soil management practices on the status of P fractions and their contribution toward P uptake and crop yields.					, Pushpanjali/P-6350-2018; Chandrika, Dr Suma/HZJ-2713-2023	, Pushpanjali/0000-0002-3213-2839; Venati, Girijaveni/0000-0001-7744-9883													0010-3624	1532-2416				JAN 2	2020	51	1					1	13		10.1080/00103624.2019.1689252	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2019.1689252		NOV 2019											WOS:000498782600001

In China, approximately 27% of the land surface is desertified. In these desertified ecosystems, aboveground interactions are known to greatly affect ecological succession, but belowground soil microbial communities are relatively unstudied. It is not yet clear how these communities change with different vegetation patch types (e.g., shrub vs. grass) across successional stages in dryland ecosystems. In this study, we assessed the effects of shrub patches (dominated by Artemisia ordosica) and grass patches on soil microbial community diversity, soil environment, and soil substrates across three successional stages (mobile, semi-mobile, and fixed dunes) in a sand dune ecosystem in the Kubuqi Desert, China. Microbial alpha diversity, as indicated by the Shannon index or operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness, was not affected by patch type but increased with successional stages. Patch type- or successional stage-induced changes in soil bacterial and fungal alpha diversity were mainly associated with soil organic carbon. Unlike alpha diversity, soil microbial beta diversity was greatly affected by successional stage and patch type. The Mantel test revealed that changes in soil bacterial beta diversity were mainly associated with soil organic carbon, and changes in soil fungal beta diversity were mainly associated with soil organic carbon and soil pH. Microbial OTU richness responded more strongly to the successional stage than the microbial Shannon index, indicating that microbial OTU richness can be used as an indicator of successional status in desert ecosystems. The consistent differences in microbial beta diversity between shrub and grass patches across the three successional stages indicate that shrubs significantly influence soil microbial communities in desert ecosystems.

Wastewater-recycled struvite as a phosphorus source in a wheat-soybean double-crop production system in eastern Arkansas	AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES & ENVIRONMENT												Fertilizer-phosphorus (P) sources are mainly derived from rock phosphate (RP), which is a finite, actively mined resource. With growing human populations globally, alternative P sources are vitally important to ensure future food security. Precipitation of the mineral struvite (MgNH4PO4 center dot 6H(2)O) from wastewater could be a potential alternative fertilizer-P option from crop production. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of chemically precipitated struvite (CPST), compared with triple superphosphate (TSP) and an unamended control (UC) treatment, and irrigation (irrigated and non-irrigated/dryland) on above- (dry matter, yield, and tissue-N, -P, and -Mg concentrations and uptake) and belowground (root tissue N, P, and Mg concentrations) soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) response in a wheat-soybean, double-crop production system on a silt-loam soil (Aquic Fraglossudalfs) in eastern Arkansas. Soybean aboveground and wheat belowground Mg concentrations were 1.1 and 1.2 times, respectively, greater (p < .05) from CPST than from TSP, while soybean belowground Mg and wheat stem P concentrations were similar between CPST and TSP. Wheat stem Mg and belowground N concentrations were 1.1 times greater (p < .05) from TSP than from CPST. Soybean seed P and Mg concentrations were 1.2 and 1.1 times, respectively, greater (p < .05) under irrigated than under dryland management. Results substantiate the use of CPST as a potential alternative fertilizer-P and -Mg source on a silt-loam soil for crop production. Using wastewater-recovered nutrients in a production-scale setting may offset the need for energy-intensive commercial fertilizers to supply essential plant nutrients.																				2639-6696					2022	5	2							e20271	10.1002/agg2.20271	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agg2.20271													WOS:000806210200001

The arid and semi-arid regions of northern China (ASARNC) are located in a key area of the generally temperate desert of the Eurasian continent, where the ecological conditions have experienced noticeable changes in recent decades. However, it is unclear whether the ecosystem functioning (EF) in this region changed abruptly and how that change was affected by natural and anthropogenic factors. Here, we estimated monthly rain use efficiency (RUE) from MODIS NDVI time series data and investigated the timing and types of turning points (TPs) in EF by the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) family algorithms during 2000-2019. The linkages between the TPs, drought, the frequency of land cover change, and socioeconomic development were examined. The results show that 63.2% of the pixels in the ASARNC region underwent sudden EF changes, of which 26.64% were induced by drought events, while 55.67% were firmly associated with the wetting climate. Wet and dry events were not detected in 17.69% of the TPs, which might have been caused by human activities. TP types and occurrences correlate differently with land cover change frequency, population density, and GDP. The improved EF TP type was correlated with the continuous humid climate and a reduced population density, while the deteriorated EF type coincided with persistent drought and increasing population density. Our research furthers the understanding of how and why TPs of EF occur and provides fundamental data for the conservation, management, and better decision-making concerning dryland ecosystems in China.

In these contexts, livestock production systems have raised controversial debates regarding their roles and effects in terms of sustainable development. The objective of this paper is to assess the level (and types) of crop-livestock integration in the dryland systems and whether they result in different well-being and improved efficiency of these agroecosystems. Using an empirical study in the newly reclaimed desert lands of the west part of the Nile Delta (Egypt), we proposed an assessment of the sustainability of the family farming systems using two approaches: a) multiple factor analysis and b) multi-criteria assessment. The multi-criteria assessment highlighted how family farm sustainability depends highly on the integration of livestock into the system, with technical or economic efficiency effects. The multiple factor analysis allowed the distinction of two types of farm systems in which livestock activity could be a source in increasing labour productivity or ensuring the viability of the farm in both short and long terms. So, the two approaches brought out the critical role of livestock in the overall efficiency of the system. However, factor analysis highlighted different profiles of integration and diversification based on-farm assets, and the multi-criteria assessment provided a comprehensive framework for conceptualizing aggregated indicators for the development of sustainable farming systems for the end-users. So these two methods may be complementarity to develop and assess the causal processes of a sustainability assessment.																			0308-521X	1873-2267				AUG	2020	183								102863	10.1016/j.agsy.2020.102863	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2020.102863													WOS:000539094600012

A. Smirn. in Mongolia	FLORA												In dry steppes, strong climatic constraints, especially highly variable precipitation, and grazing are the most important factors controlling plant life. Growth is strongly limited by water availability, while grazing may affect species presence and performance. However, there is a lack of studies on population genetics of dryland plants in general, and of those addressing grazing effects in particular. To determine the landscape-scale genetic structure of dryland species, and if grazing has an impact on that, we chose the Eurasian steppe grass Stipa glareosa for a population genetic study employing nine polymorphic Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers. We assessed genetic fingerprints of 200 individuals from six populations in Mongolia, which were sampled along a large-scale precipitation and altitudinal gradient. Nested within this gradient, sub-populations were sampled along short local transects representing different grazing intensities. Overall, S. glareosa populations showed rather low levels of genetic diversity at a mean Bruvo distance among individuals within a given population of 0.494 (mean expected heterozygosity He = 0.053). Linear mixed model analysis implied that genetic diversity was affected by both climatic constraints and local grazing conditions. We found a moderate isolation-by-distance pattern across all populations; grazing additionally influenced the genetic structure at local scale. Analysis of Molecular Variance revealed a modest genetic differentiation between populations (9 % of variation) and among sub-populations representing different grazing levels (11 %). Moreover, we detected indicator alleles that were exclusive for populations along the precipitation gradient; other alleles were associated with certain grazing levels across all populations. Thus, our data suggest that climatic constraints affect the genetic structure of S. glareosa populations, while at local scales differences in grazing disturbance may also matter.

Here, a time series study was conducted in northern Bangladesh to evaluate the impact of drought on selected causes of mortality during 2007-2017. Rainfall and temperature data from six meteorological stations were used to analyze drought and non-drought periods and to categorize mild, moderate, severe, and extreme drought based on the 3-month and 12-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI). A generalized linear model with Poisson regression with log link, a negative binomial with log link, and a zero-inflated Poisson model were used to determine associations between drought severity and mortality. The SPI and SPEI produced slightly different analysis results. Compared with the SPEI, the SPI showed a stronger and more sensitive correlation with mortality. The relative risk for respiratory disease mortality was high, and Saidpur was the most vulnerable area. Health care expenditure was negatively associated with mortality. High temperatures during the drought period were associated with suicide-related mortality in Rajshahi. The impact of drought on mortality differed with small changes in climate. The findings of this study improve our understanding of the differences between the two most used drought indicators and the impact of drought on mortality.

I exploit temporal variation in decades-long averages of weather and estimate crop acreage elasticities with respect to climate change in the United States. I find substantial climate change adaptation through acreage adjustments in US agriculture. Climate change explains about 10-35% of the observed US corn and soybean expansion over the past 30 years, and climate-driven crop substitution has played an important role.

Increasing Biodiversity and Land-Use Efficiency Through Pea (<i>Pisum aestivum</i>)-Canola (<i>Brassica napus</i>) Intercropping (Peaola)	FRONTIERS IN SOIL SCIENCE												Intercropping is an ancient agricultural management practice quickly re-gaining interest in mechanized agricultural systems. Mechanized management practices have led to a decreased biodiversity at the macro- and micro-fauna levels. These agricultural practices have also resulted in the degradation of soil and long-term inefficiencies in land, water, and nutrients. The inland Pacific Northwest (iPNW) of the United States of America is a wheat-dominated cropping system. The integration of winter and spring legumes and oilseeds has improved the biodiversity and nutrient-use efficiency of the cropping systems. This article examines the feasibility of pea-canola (peaola) intercropping in dryland production systems of the iPNW. In two site years, small plot peaola trials were established near Davenport, WA. Overall, the land equivalence ratio (LER) of peaola was found to be 1.46, showing an increase in efficiency of the system. Increasing the N fertilizer application rates did not affect peaola yield, indicating that peaola has low demand for N inputs. The effects of peaola on insects and bacterial diversity were examined on replicated large scale strip trials. Peaola was found to have significantly greater numbers of beneficial insects than the monoculture controls. There were no significant differences between the diversity of the soil bacterial communities found in peaola vs. pea and canola monocultures. However, we found that the strict core soil bacterial microbiome of peaola was larger than the monocultures and included core members from both the canola and pea soil microbiomes. In conclusion, the widespread adoption of peaola would likely increase the biodiversity and increase the land use efficiency of dryland production systems in the iPNW.																				2673-8619				JUN 30	2022	2								818862	10.3389/fsoil.2022.818862	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fsoil.2022.818862													WOS:001095840600001
J	Liu, C; Yan, XY; Jiang, FQ				Liu, Chao; Yan, Xiaoyue; Jiang, Fengqing			Desert vegetation responses to the temporal distribution patterns of precipitation across the northern Xinjiang, China	CATENA												Vegetation in arid/semiarid areas in the northern hemisphere is highly sensitive to precipitation variability. Understanding the change of dryland vegetation and its response to spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation changes is critical to delve impacts of meteorological droughts on dryland vegetation. Based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and precipitation data, we delineated the spatiotemporal pattern of trends of the arid/semiarid plant growth and its responses to daily precipitation changes in the northern Xinjiang. The results indicated several regular characteristics in the NDVI responses to precipitation at unequal time and spatial scales during the growing season, i.e. April-October. It identified shortening time lags of NDVI responses to precipitation over time. This study found for the first time that precipitation changes tend to impact NDVI changes given dry period length (DL) of > 18 days, and the effect of precipitation process was more significant. Three temporal distribution types of a precipitation process were classified, i.e. A-type or B-type precipitation process, which are characterized by two consecutive rainfall days with less or larger precipitation amount on the first day than the next day, and C-type precipitation process, which is characterized by three or more consecutive rainfall days. A- and B-type precipitation processes can benefit availability of moisture in the medium and early stage of the growing season respectively. Precipitation of 6.1-12.0 mm is the most favorable condition for the growth of desert vegetation. This study highlights multifarious vegetation responses to different precipitation processes and provides theoretical ground for ecological restoration and conservation in a changing environment across northern Xinjiang, China, and also in drylands in other regions of the globe.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				NOV	2021	206								105544	10.1016/j.catena.2021.105544	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.105544		JUN 2021											WOS:000688449100053

Changes in soil chemical properties and crop yields with long-term cropping system and nitrogen fertilization	AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES & ENVIRONMENT												Information is needed on the long-term impact of cropping system and N fertilization on dryland soil health and crop yields. We studied the 13-yr effect of cropping system and N fertilization rate on soil chemical properties at the 0- to 60-cm depth and related them to annualized crop yield in the northern Great Plains. Cropping systems were conventional tillage barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)/spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L)-fallow (CTB/WF), no-tillage barley/spring wheat-fallow (NTB/WF), no-tillage barley/spring wheat-pea (Pisum sativum L) (NTB/WP), and no-tillage continuous barley/spring wheat (NTCB/W). Nitrogen fertilization rates were 0, 40, 80, and 120 kg N ha(-1) to barley planted from 2006 to 2011 and 0, 50, 100, and 150 kg N ha(-1) to spring wheat planted from 2012 to 2018. At 0 to 5 cm, soil pH and CEC were greater with NTB/WP than NTCB/W and CTB/WF, and soil organic matter (SOM) and Olsen-P were greater with NTCB/W than CTB/WF. Increased N rate reduced soil pH, K, Ca, Mg, and CEC at most soil depths. Annualized crop yield was greater with NTCB/W and NTB/WP than NTB/WF and CTB/WF and maximized at 80-100 kg N ha(-1). Most soil chemical properties induced by N fertilization were negatively correlated, but Mg concentration at 30-60 cm induced by cropping system was positively correlated with annualized crop yield. No-till barley/spring wheat-pea rotation with 80-100 kg N ha(-1) can sustain dryland soil chemical properties and barley and spring wheat yields in the northern Great Plains.

M.; Wu, Pute; Zhao, Xining			Divergent responses of deep SOC sequestration to large-scale revegetation on China's Loess Plateau	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Dryland revegetation can mitigate land degradation, increase vegetation coverage and terrestrial C sinks, and substantially decrease soil water storage. However, variation in soil organic C (SOC) sequestration with precipitation under large-scale ecological restoration is unclear, and the trade-off between SOC sequestration and water consumption under different vegetation types remain controversial, particularly in deep soils. This study investigated SOC storage (SOCS) and soil water storage (SWS) in 0-1000 cm profiles under various vegetation types (woodland, shrubland, grassland, and farmland) along a precipitation gradient from 406 mm to 606 mm on China's Loess Plateau. The four vegetation types exhibited similar trends in the spatial distribution of SOCS and SWS, significantly increasing as mean annual precipitation (MAP) increased, except for SWS in shrubland. In contrast, deep SOC sequestration and water deficit effects varied with vegetation type and MAP. Specifically, & UDelta;SOCS (SOCS difference between restored vegetation and farmland) of woodland significantly decreased with increasing MAP, whereas no significant relationship occurred for shrubland and grassland; significant positive and negative linear correlations occurred between & UDelta;SWS (SWS difference between restored vegetation and farmland) and MAP for woodland and shrubland, respectively, with no apparent relationship for grassland. Moreover, the three restored vegetation had positive correlations between & UDelta;SOCS and & UDelta;SWS in deep soils. Woodland had the highest SOC sequestration efficiency (& UDelta;SOCS/& UDelta;SWS) but also caused the most severe soil water deficit, while grassland had the lowest C and water effect. Therefore, shrublands are better for revegetation in semiarid regions, with relatively lower soil water deficit than woodland and higher SOC sequestration effect than grassland; multispecies forest plantations dominated by R. pseudoacacia may be more suitable than single species plantations in semihumid regions. These findings highlight the SOC sequestration potential of deep soils and offer insights into dryland revegetation.

Understanding the complexity of the systems that connect the environment, society and people can help us to reduce this vulnerability and increase the resilience of communities and households to climate perturbations. In recent years, resilience theory has proven a useful approach for exploring the complexity of development challenges. As a result, there has been an increase in the development of tools and frameworks for assessing resilience. Despite this increased focus, there is no consistent use of the resilience concept in development practice and little evidence as to the benefits of using the tools. This paper aims to bridge theory and practice by coupling research on resilience with its application in the international development field. The specific hypothesis we explore is if and how rural livelihoods build resilience toward increased climatic variability in already degraded agro-ecological landscapes? We present a resilience framework with indicators to assess the extent of community resilience to climate change through improved local agricultural production and natural resources management. Primary and secondary landscape and community data, together with development of participatory watershed action plans were used to populate 16 indicators in a resilience framework baseline for the two rainfed dominated watersheds in Ethiopia and Ghana respectively. Given community awareness of the challenges related to the watershed natural resources, local agriculture and extreme weather, the communities were very willing to develop action plans to improve their management of natural resources and build climate resilience. Nevertheless, our analysis of the watershed action plans revealed that strengthening resilience through local action alone, would likely not be sufficient to meet all climate -livelihood challenges identified. To address severity and recurrence of climate change related disturbances, such as droughts, floods and disease in poverty-affected rural communities, the capacity to improve resilience will depend on external factors, in addition to inherent action. New knowledge, infrastructure and social security mechanisms, including insurance and emergency assistance need to added to build resilience for poverty-affected communities in degraded watersheds. We conclude there are also challenges in the use of resilience framework for development and climate-action related to rural poverty affected and degraded livelihood systems. Populating complex social-environmental systems will also need further development, to understand progress in resilience building under changing climate. Special attention to systemic indicators that describe the coupling and interdependencies of social-ecosystem factors will be critical to take action.

Methods: We evaluated the fine-scale effects of a subterranean ecosystem engineer, the Lesser blind mole rat on the vegetation composition of sandy dry grasslands in Hungary. In this model system we tested whether the characteristics of the patch (mound size) and the matrix (total vegetation cover in the undisturbed grassland) influence the structural and functional contrasts between the mounds and the undisturbed grasslands. We sampled the vegetation of 80 mounds and 80 undisturbed grassland plots in four sites, where we recorded the total vegetation cover, and the occurrence and cover of each vascular plant species. We used two proxies to characterise the patches (mounds) and the matrix (undisturbed grassland): we measured the perimeter of the mounds and estimated the total vegetation cover of the undisturbed grasslands. First, we compared the vegetation characteristics of the mounds and the surrounding grasslands with general linear models. Second, we characterised the contrasts between the mounds and the undisturbed grassland by relative response indices (RRIs) of the vegetation characteristics studied in the first step. Results: Species composition of the vegetation of the mounds and undisturbed grasslands was well separated in three out of the four study sites. Mounds were characterised by lower vegetation cover, lower cover of perennial graminoids, and higher diversity, and evenness compared to undisturbed grasslands. The contrast in vegetation cover between mounds and undisturbed grasslands increased with decreasing patch size. Increasing vegetation cover in the matrix grasslands increased the contrasts between the mounds and undisturbed grasslands in terms of total cover, perennial graminoid cover, diversity, and evenness. Our results suggest that mole rat mounds provide improved establishment conditions for subordinate species, because they are larger than other types of natural gaps and are characterised by less intense belowground competition. The ecosystem engineering effect, i.e., the contrast between the patches and the matrix was the largest in the more closed grasslands.

However, the health impacts of drought in this region are not well understood. Methods This study analyzed the impact of drought duration and severity on select causes of mortality in northern Bangladesh. Rainfall data from three meteorological stations (Rangpur, Dinajpur and Nilphamari) in northern Bangladesh were used to assess drought and non-drought periods, and the Standardized Precipitation Index was used to categorize mild, moderate, severe, and extreme drought. Mortality data from 2007 to 2017 for the three areas were collected from the Sample Vital Registration System, which is a survey of 1 million people. The generalized linear model with Poisson regression link was used to identify associations between mortality and the drought severity and 1-month preceding SPI. Results Only severe and extreme drought in the short-term drought periods affected mortality. Longterm drought was not associated with natural cause mortality in Rangpur and Nilphamari. In Dinajpur, mild and moderate drought was associated with circulatory and respiratory-related mortality. Conclusion The impact of drought on mortality varied by region. This study improves our understanding of how droughts affect specific causes of mortality and will help policy makers to take appropriate measures against drought impacts on selected cause of mortality. Future research will be critical to reduce drought-related risks of health.

J	Habel, JC; Ulrich, W; Eberle, J; Schmitt, T				Habel, Jan Christian; Ulrich, Werner; Eberle, Jonas; Schmitt, Thomas			Species community structures of Afrotropical butterflies differ depending on the monitoring method	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Standardised biodiversity assessment is crucial to understand community structures and population dynamics of animals. There exist various methods to monitor biodiversity. Approaches differ depending on the target species group and the aim of study, and show advantages and disadvantages. The obtained data and results are influenced by local environmental conditions and seasonal variability. In a comparative approach, we studied butterfly diversity and community structure in the dryland savannah biome of south-eastern Kenya with two different methods, transect counts and bait trapping. We repeatedly collected data throughout the dry and rainy seasons, in both near natural and anthropogenically influenced landscapes. Significantly more species and individuals were recorded by transect counts than by bait trapping, though the larger and more mobile Nymphalid species (and in particular representatives of the genus Charaxes) were comparatively overrepresented in traps. The transect data revealed much more pronounced effects of land-use and seasonality than the trap data. These results show that the choice of data collection methods must depend on the general research question, habitat conditions and season. To study the relative variation of species diversity and abundance, the collection of a fraction of the total species diversity might be sufficient. However, if the focus is on a largely complete recording of species diversity, the use of various collection methods is essential. More specifically, our data clearly demonstrate that transect counts represent a reasonable method for assessing butterfly diversity for the African dryland savannah region, but fails to fully capture occurrences of all species. Bait trapping can be used only as a supplementary method for assessing some few highly mobile low-density species.

A hypothetical improvement in yields for dryland soybean varieties is incorporated into the model and shown to have a positive impact on aquifer outcomes and producer profits. The example illustrates that a change in one practice-crop combination can have system-wide impacts, as evidenced by the change in acreages for all crops and practices.

The current study was investigated to determine the grass and non-grass species' yield responses to four cutting frequencies over two years (2019 and 2020). The four treatments were cutting once after the end of the main growing season (T1), cutting every week (T2), cutting every-two weeks (T3), and cutting every-three weeks (T4). Treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications. In total, 37 different herbaceous species comprising 15 grasses and 22 non-grasses were sampled. Treatments had a significant effect (p < 0.01) on herbaceous biomass with yield decreasing as the number of cutting frequencies increase. Herbaceous species richness was significantly (p < 0.05) high for T4. Grass biomass was significantly (p < 0.001) high for T1. T4 markedly (p < 0.05) favored non-grass species richness and diversity while T3 significantly (p < 0.05) promoted density. Subsequent cutting over years significantly (p < 0.05) affected grass species composition and biomass. Continuous application of more frequent cuttings over years significantly (p < 0.05) favored non-grass species composition and density. Of the herbaceous vegetation attributes studied, only biomass was significantly (p < 0.05) affected by subsequent application of cutting frequencies over years being high for less frequent cutting (T1). Furthermore, T1 enhanced the percentages dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and acid detergent lignin (ADL) of both grass and non-grass species. T2 favored the percentage of crude protein and true in-vitro organic matter digestibility for grass and non-grass species. Our study outlines that intermediate cutting (T4) had a positive effect on herbaceous vegetation attributes and forage nutritional qualities. Hence, for short-term rangeland management in terms of plant yield and better quality, cutting every-three weeks (intermediate cutting) will be suggested when applied subsequently over years.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2022	145								109672	10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109672	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109672		NOV 2022											WOS:000915914000001

The identification of root architectural and anatomical characteristics holds paramount importance for the development of alfalfa genotypes with enhanced adaptation to adverse environmental conditions. In this study, we employed a visual rhizobox system to investigate the variability in root system architecture (including root depth, root length, root tips number, etc.), anatomical features (such as cortical traits, total stele area, number and area of vessel, etc.), as well as nitrogen and phosphorus uptake across 53 alfalfa genotypes during the seedling stage.Results Out of the 42 traits measured, 21 root traits, along with nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) uptake, displayed higher coefficients of variation (CVs = 0.25) among the tested genotypes. Local root morphological and anatomical traits exhibited more significant variation than global root traits. Twenty-three traits with CVs = 0.25 constituted to six principal components (eigenvalues > 1), collectively accounting for 88.0% of the overall genotypic variation. Traits such as total root length, number of root tips, maximal root depth, and others exhibited positive correlations with shoot dry mass and root dry mass. Additionally, total stele area and xylem vessel area showed positive correlations with N and P uptake.Conclusions These root traits, which have demonstrated associations with biomass and nutrient uptake, may be considered for the breeding of alfalfa genotypes that possess efficient resource absorption and increased adaptability to abiotic stress, following validation during the entire growth period in the field.

Evaluation of miscanthus productivity and water use efficiency in southeastern United States	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Second generation biofuels, such as perennial grasses, have potential to provide biofuel feedstock while growing on degraded land with minimal inputs. Perennial grasses have been reported to sequester large amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the Midwestern United States (USA). However, there has been little work on biofuel and carbon sequestration potential of perennial grasses in the Southeastern US. Biofuel productivity for dryland Miscanthus x gigantus and irrigated maize in Georgia, USA were quantified using eddy covariance observations of evapotranspiration (ET) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon. Miscanthus biomass yield was 15.54 Mg ha(-1) in 2015 and 11.80 Mg ha(-1) in 2016, while maize produced 30.20 Mg ha(-1) of biomass in 2016. Carbon budgets indicated that both miscanthus and maize fields lost carbon over the experiment. The miscanthus field lost 5 Mg C ha(-1) in both 2015 and 2016 while the maize field lost 1.37 Mg C ha(-1) for the single year of study. Eddy covariance measurement indicated that for 2016 the miscanthus crop evapotranspired 598 mm and harvest water use efficiencies ranged from 6.95 to 13.84 kg C ha(-1) mm(-1). Maize evapotranspired 659 mm with a harvest water use efficiency of 19.12 kg C ha(-1) mm(-1). While biomass yields and gross primary production were relatively high, high ecosystem respiration rates resulted in a loss of ecosystem carbon. Relatively low biomass production, low water use efficiency and high respiration for Miscanthus x gigantus in this experiment suggest that this strain of miscanthus may not be well-suited for dryland production under the environmental conditions found in South Georgia USA.

J	Qiao, N; Wang, LX				Qiao, Na; Wang, Lixin			Satellite observed vegetation dynamics and drivers in the Namib sand sea over the recent 20 years	ECOHYDROLOGY												Monitoring dryland vegetation trends and examining the drivers are of great importance to understand the dryland vegetation response to future climate changes. Recent findings through satellite data indicate that vegetation greenness has increased in several regions worldwide. These greening patterns are driven by human activities or combined human activities and environmental factors. However, the analyses of greenness trend for regions without direct human activities and shrub expansion in drylands are still lacking. To this end, this study investigates the vegetation trend across the Namib sand sea over March 2000 to December 2018 using monthly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and examines several potential drivers including precipitation, temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration. For the NDVI time series across the whole study region, a significant greening trend was found over March 2000 to September 2012 based on Mann-Kendall test but not over the whole study period. Structural equation modelling results indicated that precipitation and CO2 were the dominant drivers of greening. Temperature showed negative effects on vegetation greenness, indicating warming would reduce plant growth in the study region. Spatially, 75% of the region showed statistically significant greening over March 2000 to September 2012 and 39.30% for March 2000 to December 2018. The different vegetation trend results between the entire region and the pixel scale implied that location-specific greening could be masked by an overall trend. Our study suggested that precipitation (especially the large episodic precipitation events) and CO2 are dominant drivers of the observed greening in the Namib. Our findings fill an important knowledge gap of vegetation dynamics in regions without direct human activities.

J.; Munoz-Rojas, Miriam			Bio-priming seeds with cyanobacteria: effects on native plant growth and soil properties	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic bacteria that form a fundamental part of soil biocrusts, enhance soil function and structure, and can promote plant growth. We assessed the potential of cyanobacteria as a seed bio-primer for mine-site restoration in an arid region in Western Australia, examining its effects on native plant growth and the characteristics of mine soil substrates used in dryland restoration. Cyanobacteria strains indigenous to the study region (Leptolyngbya sp., Microcoleus sp., Nostoc sp., and Scytonema sp.) were used to create an inoculant. Seeds of seven native plant species were bio-primed with the inoculant, and their germination and growth assessed in a laboratory experiment. Seedling growth after bio-priming was assessed in a glasshouse experiment for a subset of three species, in two different substrates (topsoil and mine waste). Soil properties related to soil function, e.g. total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and microbial activity, were also measured. Minor effects on germination were recorded with only significantly higher germination rates reported in E. gamophylla. Soil parameters were generally higher in topsoil than in mine waste, regardless of bio-priming treatment. However, bio-priming resulted in seedlings of four species producing longer radicles and/or shoots. For example, seedling root lengths of bio-primed G. wickhamii were 57% larger than the control treatment (30.1 +/- 4.3 and 13.0 +/- 1.6 mm, respectively); and shoots of T. wiseana were 54% longer in the bio-primed treatment (18.6 +/- 1.6 mm) compared to the control (8.53 +/- 1.4 mm). Overall, our results highlight that bio-priming with cyanobacteria may improve plant growth for some species commonly used in dryland restoration.

J	Gxokwe, S; Dube, T; Mazvimavi, D				Gxokwe, Siyamthanda; Dube, Timothy; Mazvimavi, Dominic			An assessment of long-term and large-scale wetlands change dynamics in the Limpopo transboundary river basin using cloud-based Earth observation data	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Significant progress has been made in monitoring and assessing the effects of land use and land cover (LULC) changes on wetland extent. However, our understanding of wetland within the transboundary basins has been limited by the scarcity of available data on their dynamic changes over time. This study aimed to address this gap by analyzing the long-term and large-scale spatio-temporal extent of wetland in the Limpopo transboundary river basin (LTRB) over a 20-year period (2000-2020). To achieve this, we utilized the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-computing platform and various remotely sensed data. The study had two primary objectives; (1) to examine LULC changes over time using machine learning algorithms applied to multisource remotely sensed data in GEE, and (2) to assess the relationship between LULC changes and the extent of wetlands in the basin. A total of nine land cover classes were identified, including shrublands, croplands, bare-surface, wetlands, sparse vegetation, tree cover, built-up areas, and grasslands. Shrublands covered 76-82% of the LTRB. On the other hand, wetlands and sparse vegetation were the least dominant, with proportions ranging from 0.3 to 2%. The overall accuracy of the classification results was within acceptable ranges, ranging from 77 to 78%. The study further revealed a continuing decline in wetlands extent and sparse vegetation, with average rates of 19% and 44%, respectively. Conversely, shrublands, croplands, and tree cover showed an increase, with average rates of 0.4% and 12.4% respectively. A significant finding was the replacement of a substantial portion (40%) of wetland areas with built-up areas, indicating that urban expansion is a major driver of wetland shrinkage in the study area. These results provide valuable insights into the declining extent of wetlands in the LTRB. Such findings are crucial for environmental management efforts, as they provide information on which wetlands should be prioritized when implementing strategies to prevent the negative impacts of LULC changes on wetlands in the area. Therefore, contributing towards achieving sustainable development goals relating to freshwater ecosystems protection and management.																			0923-4861	1572-9834				2023 NOV 30	2023										10.1007/s11273-023-09963-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-023-09963-y		NOV 2023											WOS:001111051800001

Understanding transitions in farming systems and their effects on livestock rearing and smallholder livelihoods in Telangana, India	AMBIO												Increasing food demands are causing rapid transitions in farming systems, often involving intensified land and resource use. While transitioning has benefits regarding poverty alleviation and food outputs, it also causes environmental and social issues over time. This study aims to understand the transitions in farming systems in a region in Telangana, from 1997 to 2015, and their effect on livestock rearing and smallholder livelihoods. We also examine the impact of the transitions on lower caste groups and women in particular. We collected data using a combination of methods, i.e., a household survey, focus group discussions, and secondary data sources, to build a comprehensive picture of the transitions in the region. We found that subsistence mixed farming systems transitioned to market-orientated specialized systems over a short time span. As the transition process gained momentum, households either intensified their production or got marginalized. Technological interventions, development programs with integrated approaches, and market demand for certain agricultural produce triggered increased regional production but also led to the scarcity of water, land, and labor. The transitions marginalized some of the households, changed the role of livestock in farming, and have been inclusive of both lower caste groups and women in terms of increased ownership of large ruminants and access to technologies. However, for women specifically, further increase in workload in the context of farming is also found.

Improving field success of biocrust rehabilitation materials: hardening the organisms or softening the environment?	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Drylands are a widely degraded biome characterized by low productivity and high abiotic stress. Biological soil crust (biocrust) inoculants hold promise as a rehabilitation material in drylands, useful for boosting ecosystem functions including stabilization of eroding soil surfaces. However, biocrust materials cultivated ex situ by humans inconsistently establish under field conditions. We tested two approaches aimed at improving field establishment of biocrust inoculum: exposing the organisms within the inoculum to abiotic stress in an attempt to harden them, and applying habitat ameliorations intended to reduce the stressfulness of the environment. We hypothesized that both approaches in concert would lead to the most consistent field establishment of biocrusts. Overall, addition of biocrust inoculum did enhance biocrust establishment over the 1.5-year duration of the study but did not result in full recovery. Generally, hardened biocrust inoculum performed no better than inoculum that was not hardened, although one indicator (chlorophyll a) was enhanced by addition of hardened inoculum in some circumstances. Temporary irrigation was initially an effective habitat amelioration but had no effect on biocrust establishment by 1.5 years. In contrast, application of jute net to the soil surface promoted biocrust establishment both in synergy with and in the absence of inoculum addition. We hypothesize that jute net stabilizes the soil surface, reduces abiotic stress, and enhances resource availability, overcoming barriers to establishment of biocrusts. Currently, there is broad support for the efficacy of habitat amelioration approaches in biocrust rehabilitation, but effective hardening techniques remain elusive.

Moench] harvest and wheat (Triticum aestivum) planting with cover crops provides opportunity to increase productivity and profitability in dryland winter wheat-sorghum-fallow (WSF) cropping systems. The objective of this study was to identify potential spring fallow replacement cover crops and management to optimize productivity and resource use efficiency of a WSF system. The study was conducted 2013-2018 at Garden City, KS. Three crop rotation phases (WSF, SFW, and FWS) were the main plot, and fallow replacement cover crops were the sub plot. Cover crop treatments were further split into hayed and cover crop left standing groups to estimate forage potential. Results showed precipitation utilization and storage efficiency (PUtSE) increased by 146% for grain cover crop, 50% for cover crop hayed, and 38% for cover crop left standing compared with fallow. Available soil water at wheat planting (ASWP(ww)) was not different between cover crop left standing and fallow. Spring triticale [xTriticosecale Wittm. ex A. Camus (Secale x Triticum)] had up to 182% more forage accumulation over other forage cover crops and a 108% grain yield advantage over other grain cover crops. Our findings showed fallow replacement, forage-hayed, and grain cover crops have a greater PUtSE than fallow which may increase economic returns if subsequent crop yields are not reduced. Cover crops left standing had a moderate PUtSE advantage and similar ASWP(ww) compared to fallow, and cover crop left standing, or fallow would be the best choice if the production goal is to maximize ASWP(ww) and subsequent crop yields.

Cover crop mixtures enhance stability but not productivity in a semi-arid climate	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Cover crops are a critical component of sustainable agroecosystems, yet their performance in semi-arid environments with short growing seasons and highly variable precipitation is inconsistent. To evaluate productivity and stability of single species vs. multi-species cover crop plantings with variable water input, cover crops were evaluated at two sites in North Dakota under dryland and dryland plus irrigation conditions. Cover crop treatments consisted of three warm-season monocultures, a three warm-season species mixture (MIX3), and a three warm-season and three cool-season species mixture (MIX6). Averaged across year and water regime, biomass production was not greater for mixtures (8,693 kg ha(-1), MIX3; 10,212 kg ha(-1), MIX6) than for the most productive monoculture (11,295 kg ha(-1), sunflower [Helianthus annuus L.]) at the West site. The same held true at the East site (7,486 kg ha(-1), MIX3; 8,603 kg ha(-1), MIX6), with cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] producing the most biomass, 10,886 kg ha(-1), of all monocultures. At the West site, variability in production was lowest for MIX6 when pooled across year and water regime (CV = 25%) compared to monocultures (CV >= 49%). At the East site, cowpea had the lowest CV (24%) while mixtures averaged 35%. Pooled across sites, production in the MIX6 plots had the lowest variability (29%). Grasses consistently contributed to high proportions of total biomass production compared to other functional types. Multi-species cover crop mixtures are more versatile than single species plantings across climates, and resilient cover crop mixtures integrated into semi-arid crop rotations as full- season plantings should include warm and cool season grasses.

We built annual, 30 m resolution irrigation maps using Google Earth Engine for the years 1986-2018 for 11 western states within the conterminous U.S. Our map classifies lands into four classes: irrigated agriculture, dryland agriculture, uncultivated land, and wetlands. We built an extensive geospatial database of land cover from each class, including over 50,000 human-verified irrigated fields, 38,000 dryland fields, and over 500,000 km2of uncultivated lands. We used 60,000 point samples from 28 years to extract Landsat satellite imagery, as well as climate, meteorology, and terrain data to train a Random Forest classifier. Using a spatially independent validation dataset of 40,000 points, we found our classifier has an overall binary classification (irrigated vs. unirrigated) accuracy of 97.8%, and a four-class overall accuracy of 90.8%. We compared our results to Census of Agriculture irrigation estimates over the seven years of available data and found good overall agreement between the 2832 county-level estimates (r2= 0.90), and high agreement when estimates are aggregated to the state level (r2= 0.94). We analyzed trends over the 33-year study period, finding an increase of 15% (15,000 km2) in irrigated area in our study region. We found notable decreases in irrigated area in developing urban areas and in the southern Central Valley of California and increases in the plains of eastern Colorado, the Columbia River Basin, the Snake River Plain, and northern California.

Regular monitoring of reproductive efficiency is essential to assess management and to avoid financial losses due to poor performance. To allow more objective measurement and comparisons over time, we propose a novel quantitative approach for defining annual reproductive performance by combining common performance indicators into a goat flock index. Commonly used reproductive performance measures were collected from 242 goat flocks in four districts in dryland of Ethiopia between July 2018 and February 2019. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to identify biologically meaningful latent components that explain annual reproductive output (ARO) and annual reproductive wastage (ARW). Together with the remaining annual reproductive performance measures, the ARO and ARW components were included in a PCA to derive an algorithm for a goat annual reproductive performance index (G-ARPI). One component representing variation in kidding interval, PC(ARO)1 and PC(ARW)1 was extracted and normalized to a 10-scale value. The flocks were classified into good performing (15.63%) with index > 8.5, moderately performing (48.21%) with index values ranging from 6.5 to 8.5 and poor performing (36.16%) with index < 6.5. Good performing flocks have higher scores for reproductive output measures, lower scores for reproductive wastage and lower kidding interval. The proposed G-ARPI can be used as an objective tool to compare reproductive performance between management systems, evaluate the costs of poor reproductive management and will be useful for economic models that aim to identify the most cost-efficient intervention option and monitor the impact of interventions. We present here the index for goat production in dryland systems in Ethiopia; the approach can easily be adapted to other production systems elsewhere.

Thus, clarifying the impact of soil moisture on T is critical for comprehensive forest-water management and sustainable development. In this study, T, meteorological factors (reference evapotranspiration, ETref), soil moisture (relative soil water content, RSWC), and leaf area index (LAI) in a Larix principis-rupprechtii plantation of Liupan Mountains in the dryland region of Northwest China were simultaneously monitored during the growing seasons in 2017-2019. A modified Jarvis-Stewart model was established by introducing the impact of RSWC in different soil layers (0-20, 20-40, and 40-60 cm, respectively) to quantify the independent contribution of RSWC of different soil layers to T. Results showed that with rising ETref, T firstly increased and then decreased, and with rising RSWC and LAI, T firstly increased and then gradually stabilised, respectively. The modified Jarvis-Stewart model was able to give comparable estimates of T to those derived from sap flow measurements. The contribution of RSWC to T in different soil layers has obvious specificity, and the contribution rate of 20-40 cm (13.4%) and 0-20 cm soil layers (6.6%) where roots are mainly distributed is significantly higher than that of 40-60 cm soil layer (1.9%). As the soil moisture status changes from moist (RSWC0-60cm & GE; 0.4) to drought (RSWC0-60cm < 0.4), the role of the soil moisture in the 0-20 cm soil layer increased compared with other layers. The impacts of soil moisture that were coupled into the Jarvis-Stewart model can genuinely reflect the environmental influence and can be used to quantify the contributions of soil moisture to T. Thus, it has the potential to become a new tool to guide the protection and management of forest water resources.					wang, yanhui/HPG-3348-2023	liu, ze bin/0000-0001-6568-1837														2073-4441				OCT	2021	13	19							2720	10.3390/w13192720	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13192720													WOS:000727332300001

Rainfall frequency and soil water availability regulate soil methane and nitrous oxide fluxes from a native forest exposed to elevated carbon dioxide	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. Free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) experiments in terrestrial ecosystems have demonstrated ecological responses of key ecosystem processes to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). However, CO2 fertilization responses in field conditions have seldom included methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), particularly in natural and mature forests, which are expected to have an important role in climate change mitigation. 2. Herein, we aimed to capture the effect of elevated CO2 (eCO(2); ambient vs. +150 ppm) on long-term temporal dynamics of CH4 and N2O fluxes, followed by identification of climo-edaphic factors explaining feedback responses. To achieve this, continuous monitoring of greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes using a manual chamber technique, over a 3-year period was implemented in a mature dryland Eucalypt forest FACE (EucFACE) facility in Australia. The relationship between CH4 and N2O fluxes with rainfall indices and soil properties was also explored since they directly impact the microbial communities in the soil responsible for CH4 and N2O net emissions. 3. Our results showed that in 3 years of eCO(2) treatment, the amount and frequency of rainfall predicted GHG emissions in this native forest. We also found a significant reduction in CH4 sink (15%-25%) for some of the years as well as an overall treatment effect index reduction in N2O emissions under eCO(2). Higher frequency of rain events with lower intensity led to highest CH4 sink followed by lowest N2O emissions due to fewer wet-dry cycles. Of all the environmental variables included, soil moisture, rainfall and pH were the main predictors of net CH4 and N2O emissions. Methane flux was also strongly influenced by soil texture. 4. Our findings highlight the need to account for reduced forest CH4 sink under eCO(2) in dryland ecosystems, which has implications for GHG budget predictions under future climate conditions.

Yet, its continuous, long-term usage in situ is challenged due to the lack of appropriate daytime indicators. We investigated the prospect of creating new daytime indicators based on an application of linear regression on daily measurements of photochemical efficiency (.PSII) and photosynthetically active radiation acquired in situ at 30-minute intervals. Daily regression parameters, thus generated, were subsequently used in a broader context of desert-plant response to environmental change. Here, we compared parametric and non-parametric methods to test the feasibility of daytime-based regression parameters, i.e., maximal quantum yield of photosystem II photochemistry (Fv/Fm) and daily mean.PSII, in gauging physiological response in three shrub and two herb species as influenced by eight environmental variables. Results demonstrated that: (i) Random Forest (RF; a nonparametric method) provided the best assessment of interaction between ChlF-based parameters and environmental variables, compared with multiple linear regression (MLR; a conventional parametric method); (ii) variable importance and partial dependence plots indicated that the daily regression parameters of the.PSII-tophotosynthetic photon flux density relationship (y-intercept and slope) were superior to those of.PSII and Fv/Fm; and (iii) compared with Fv/Fm, the y-intercept and slope improved discrimination of interspecific differences (p < 0.05). Our research showed that the regression y-intercept and slope can serve as practical daytime indicators of desert-plant photosynthetic physiology in field applications of continuous ChlF measurements. RF is extremely skilled at capturing nonlinearities in eco-environmental interactions compared with standard parametric methods. This new method provides a basis for the collection of key ecological information in assessing desertplant physiological response to environmental variability.

Soil samples were collected from a corn field with straw mulching (SM) for nine years and without straw mulching (CK), and incubated at 15 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 35 degrees C for 60 days. Soil respiration, C fractions and bacterial and fungal community structure were measured SM had greater soil organic carbon and potential C mineralization and a similar microbial biomass carbon throughout the incubation when compared with CK. Soil respiration increased with increasing temperature and its temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) was lower with SM than CK. Similar microbial community composition was found in the soils with SM and CK before incubation. However, SM had a greater bacterial richness and the relative abundances ofProteobacteria,Acidobacteria,Nitrospirae,Planctomycetes,Bacteroidetes, andBasidiomycota, but lower relative abundances ofActinobacteria,Chloroflexi,and Ascomycotathan CK after incubation. Bacterial richness and diversity were greater at 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C than 35 degrees C, but there was no difference in fungal richness and diversity among the incubation temperatures. As temperature increased, the relative abundances ofChloroflexi,Acidobacteria, andBacteroidetesdecreased, butGemmatimonadetesandAscomycotaincreased, and were significantly correlated with soil C fractions and respiration. These findings indicated that the effect of straw mulching on soil C cycling and microbial community structure can be highly modified by increasing temperature.

Puroindoline genes (PINs) are the major genes responsible for grain hardness, but other QTLs also contribute to the trait. Therefore, it is essential to identify loci associated with the HI and allelic variations of PINs in wheat. In the present study, 287 accessions from Shanxi province representing 70 years of wheat breeding were grown in one rainfed and two irrigated conditions to study grain hardness. Genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) was performed using the 15 K array, and the variability of PIN alleles was investigated. Among the accessions, hard wheat was most common The broad-sense heritability (H-2) among the three environments was 99.5%, suggesting HI was mainly affected by heredity. GWAS identified nine significant marker-trait associations (MTAs), including that PINs, which explained 7.03% to 17.70% of phenotypic variation. Four MTAs on chromosome 2A, 2B, 5A, and 7A were novel loci. As for diversity of PINs, a total of 11 PINs haplotypes were detected, composed of 12 allelic variations of the PIN gene. The most frequent haplotypes were Pina-D1a/Pinb-D1b (43.9%) and Pina-D1a/Pinb-D1b (18.8%), and both the frequency of Pina-D1a/Pinb-D1b and the HI value increased with breeding years were related to local dietary habits probably. A novel double deletion allele of the PINs haplotype was found in Dong-hei1206. These results will be useful not only in understanding of the genetics of the HI but also in breeding for improved grain texture.																			1380-3743	1572-9788				JUL	2022	42	7							40	10.1007/s11032-022-01303-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-022-01303-x								37313507					WOS:000817936600002

PAEs in soil could be taken up and accumulated by dietary intake of food crops such as wheat, thus imposing health risks to residents. In the present study, samples from a long-term location-fixed field experiment were examined to clarify the accumulation of PAEs in soil and wheat, and to assess the human health risks from PAEs via dietary intake of wheat grain under plastic film mulching cultivation in dryland. Results showed that concentrations of PAEs in grains from mulching plots ranged from 4.1 to 12.6 mg kg(-1), which were significantly higher than those in the control group. There was a positive correlation for the PAE concentrations between wheat grains and field soils. Concentrations of PAEs in the soil were in the range of 1.8-3.5 mg kg(-1), for the mulching treatment, and 0.9-2.7 mg kg(-1), for the control group. Di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) and di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were detected in all soil and grain samples, and DEHP was found to be the dominant PAE compound in grains. Based on DEHP concentrations in wheat grains, the values of carcinogenic risk for adults were higher than the recommended value 10(-4). Results indicated that wheat grains from film mulching plots posed a considerable non-carcinogenic risk to residents, with children being the most sensitive resident group. Findings of this work call the attention to the potential pollution of grain crops growing in the plastic film mulching crop production systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Increases in aridity are known to negatively impact fungal community composition in dryland ecosystems globally; yet, much less is known on the potential influence of other environmental drivers, and whether these relationships are linear or nonlinear. Time period2017-2021. LocationGlobal. Major taxa studiedFungi. MethodsWe re-analysed multiple datasets from different dryland biogeographical regions, for a total of 912 samples and 1,483 taxa. We examined geographical patterns in community diversity and composition, and spatial, edaphic and climatic factors driving them. ResultsUV index, climate seasonality, and sand content were the most important environmental predictors of community shifts, showing the strongest association with the richness of putative plant pathogens and saprobes. Important nonlinear relationships existed with each of these fungal guilds, with increases in UV and temperature seasonality above 7.5 and 900 SD (standard deviation x 100 of the mean monthly temperature), respectively, being associated with an increased probability of plant pathogen and unspecified saprotroph occurrence. Conversely, these environmental parameters had a negative relationship with litter and soil saprotroph richness. Consequently, these ecological groups might be particularly sensitive to shifts in UV radiation and climate seasonality, which is likely to disturb current plant-soil dynamics in drylands. Main conclusionsOur synthesis integrates fungal community data from drylands across the globe, allowing the investigation of fungal distribution and providing the first evidence of shifts in fungal diversity and composition of key fungal ecological groups along diverse spatial, climatic and edaphic gradients in these widely distributed ecosystems. Our findings imply that shifts in soil structure and seasonal climatic patterns induced by global change will have disproportionate consequences for the distribution of fungal groups linked to vegetation and biogeochemical cycling in drylands, with implications for plant-soil interactions in drylands.

However, the fundamental question as to the association of WUE with RUE and its underlying mechanism under limited-water availability remains contentious. Here, a two-year field trial for maize designed with five progressive soil drying regimes applied at two different growth stages (three-leaf stage and seven-leaf stage) was conducted during the 2013-2014 growing seasons. Both environmental variables and maize growth traits at the leaf and canopy levels were measured during the soil drying process. The results showed that leaf WUE increased with irrigation reduction at the early stage, while it decreased with irrigation reduction at the later stage. Leaf RUE thoroughly decreased with irrigation reduction during the progressive soil drying process. Aboveground biomass (AGB), leaf area index (LAI), a fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), and light extinction coefficient (k) of the maize canopy were significantly decreased by water deficits regardless of the growth stages when soil drying applied. The interrelationships between WUE and RUE were linear across the leaf and canopy scales under different soil drying patterns. Specifically, a positive linear relationship between WUE and RUE are unexpectedly found when soil drying was applied at the three-leaf stage, while it turned out to be negative when soil drying was applied at the seven-leaf stage. Moreover, the interaction between canopy WUE and RUE was more regulated by fAPAR than LAI under soil drying. Our findings suggest that more attention must be paid to fAPAR in evaluating the effect of drought on crops and may bring new insights into the interrelationships of water and radiation use processes in dryland agricultural ecosystems.					huailin, zhou/D-5123-2014; Zhou, Huailin/AAP-7367-2021	huailin, zhou/0000-0002-2313-8577; Zhou, Huailin/0000-0002-2313-8577													1664-462X					DEC 10	2021	12								794409	10.3389/fpls.2021.794409	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.794409								34956294					WOS:000741440800001

Analyzing Pathways of Nurturing Informal Seed Production into Formal Private Ventures for Sustainable Seed Delivery and Crop Productivity: Experiences from Ethiopia	SUSTAINABILITY												Sustaining crop production and productivity in sub-Saharan Africa requires the availability and use of quality seed of improved varieties by smallholder farmers. The private sector has been considered as the best way to sustain seed supply and crop productivity. Unfortunately, the private sector's share in the seed production and delivery in sub-Saharan Africa countries has not been very substantial for decades. As a consequence, farmer access to quality seed of recently released varieties remains very low. This manuscript analyzes the experiences of informal seed producers who graduated to formal private seed enterprises to understand the effectiveness of the support they receive to become viable seed ventures. We used comparative research methods to analyze the qualitative and quantitative data collected to understand the underlying mechanisms. The findings showed that the analyzed seed enterprises started with as little as about USD 300 and have already multiplied over tenfold their initial capital. They benefited from a wide variety of supports, e.g., quality seed production, marketing, partnerships, and value chain development trainings and infrastructures, from extension workers, research centers, national and international NGOs, and the other private seed enterprise operators like large public seed enterprises and agro-dealers. The seed enterprises are producing pre-basic, basic, and certified seed of cereals and self-pollinated legume crops delivered directly to farmers, institutional markets, and agro-dealers. The seed production data have been increasing for the past three years with an area expanding from about 30 ha to over 150 ha per year for chickpea. The seed production and delivery practices being employed are smallholder farmer-based practices that are environmentally friendly. For sustainable and reliable seed production and delivery systems in sub-Saharan Africa, a bold step is needed whereby the informal seed production entities are nurtured and upgraded into formal certified seed production ventures that deliver social and economic benefits to the promotors and the communities.

This study focuses on migration and transformation of Cd in rotation systems and the influencing factors. In a two-year field experiment, four rotation systems were eval-uated: traditional rice and oilseed rape (TRO), low-Cd rice and oilseed rape (LRO), maize and oilseed rape (MO), and soybean and oilseed rape (SO). Oilseed rape is a remediation plant in rotation systems. Compared to 2020, the grain Cd concentrations of traditional rice, low-Cd rice, and maize in 2021 decreased by 73.8%, 65.7%, and 24.0% (below the safety limits), respectively. However, soybean increased by 71.4%. The LRO system featured the highest oil content of rapeseed (about 50%) and economic output/input ratio (1.34). Removal efficiency of total Cd in soil was 10.03% (TRO) > 8.3% (LRO) > 5.32% (SO) > 3.21% (MO). Crop uptake of Cd was influenced by bioavailability of soil Cd, and soil environmental factors regulated the bioavailable Cd. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that soil nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) had a dominant impact on bioavailable Cd in soil, with variance contributions of 56.7% for paddy-upland (TRO and LRO) and 53.5% for dryland (MO and SO) rotation systems. The difference reflected that ammonium N (NH4+-N) was a secondary factor in paddy-upland rotations, while it was the available phosphorus (P) in dryland rotations, with variance contributions of 10.4% and 24.3%, respectively. The comprehensive evaluation of crop safety, production, economic benefits, and remediation efficiency revealed that the LRO system was efficient and more acceptable to local farmers, providing a new direction for the utilization and remediation of Cd-contaminated farmland.					wang, yue/ISA-4119-2023; zhao, fenghua/B-5235-2013; chen, chen/JGD-3057-2023; Jiang, Yu/JEZ-9814-2023; Li, Jiawei/JOJ-9277-2023; liu, xinyu/IWD-6630-2023; liu, xy/JEP-3175-2023; LI, Xiang/JBJ-8387-2023; li, wenjing/JMP-7498-2023; zhang, yue/JAC-3705-2023	zhao, fenghua/0000-0003-1447-0460; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				AUG 10	2023	885								163893	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163893	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163893		MAY 2023						37146815					WOS:001000591800001

Vegetation index (VI) easily obtained by proximal remote sensing has been used as a non-destructive and high-throughput way in crop monitoring, especially in chlorophyll estimation. However, the estimated results of the field chlorophyll content by VIs always face challenges from soil background inhibition and estimation stability under the dynamic changes of vegetation biomass. Thus, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based chlorophyll content estimation was conducted by evaluating VI responses under different crop coverages. An analysis was conducted on 36 VIs under different crop coverage conditions to explore their response differences and robustness for chlorophyll estimation. This work focused on the three kinds of VIs named simple vegetation index, modified vegetation index, and functional vegetation index. In 2020, at the experimental station of Dryland Farming Institute of Hebei Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, UAV carrying multispectral sensor was used to collect visible and near-infrared images of the canopy at the jointing stage of maize under six fertilization levels to obtain VIs. After the UAV fled, ground calibration and sample collection were performed simultaneously, and chlorophyll content was measured. For data processing, correlation coefficient method (CCM) and maximal information coefficient (MIC) were first used to analyze the correlation response characteristics of VIs and chlorophyll content under three different coverage levels. The results showed that when the level of canopy coverage was increased, the linear correlation between VIs and chlorophyll content was substantially reduced. The MIC response indicating linear and non-linear combination relationship was more robust. In addition, the VIs obtained by UAV had a significant linear correlation with maize canopy chlorophyll under low (0.05-0.35) and medium (0.35-0.48) coverage, but an obvious non-linear correlation under high (0.48-0.75) coverage. Chlorophyll-sensitive parameters were then screened based on methods of CCM, MIC, and random frog method (RFM), respectively. Partial least squares regression (PLS) and random forest (RF) algorithms were used to establish the maize canopy chlorophyll content detection models. The findings showed that when Green minus red vegetation index (GMR), Red light normalized value (NRI), Normalized difference red edge (NDRE), Modified simple ratio with red edge (MSRREG), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized red green difference vegetation index (NDIg), Normalized red blue difference vegetation index (NDIb), Soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), Optimized soil adjusted vegetation index with red edge (OSAVIREG), Soil-atmospherically resistant vegetation index (SARVI) were selected based on RFM as the optimal spectral variables, the chlorophyll content detection model constructed based on PLS had the least numbers of characteristic variables and the best model accuracy. The training set R-2 and RMSE were 0.753 and 2.089 mg/L, respectively, and the verification set R-2 and RMSE were 0.682 and 2.361 mg/L, respectively. Field chlorophyll content and detection error distribution maps were also drawn and combined with the distribution of fertilization management to provide support for the UAV monitoring of crop growth in the field and variable fertilization management decisions.

Although the alpine grassland of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is sensitive and vulnerable to climate change, a generalized pattern of PUE along the water and heat availability gradients is still unavailable. Here, a transect survey was conducted across grasslands on the TP to measure ANPP in the community and further explored the patterns of PUE along aridity index (AI) gradients with "Changepoint" analysis method. The results indicated that two patterns of PUE were detected, with significantly (P < 0.05) lower PUE (0.15 g m(-2) mm(-1)) in arid environments than that in semiarid and humid environments (0.30 g m(-2) mm(-1)). These PUE patterns were largely due to the differences in vegetative ANPP and coverage (COV). Specifically, the relatively low annual mean precipitation (210.90 mm) and soil nutrients limited the vegetative ANPP and COV in arid environments as a result of lower PUE. In contrast, the increased precipitation and soil nutrients induced significantly (P < 0.05) positive effects on ANPP and COV. Consequently, the PUE was significantly (P < 0.05) promoted by soil C, ANPP, and COV, with standard total effects of 0.19, 0.89 and 0.29 in the structural equation model, respectively. Notably, a negative relationship between AI and PUE was detected (AI > 55), this phenomenon was probably explained by plants via losing water resources to take up more soil nutrients in humid environments. Because the higher stomatal conductance of plant in humid environments leads to higher transpiration (water loss) and therefore can improve soil nutrient uptake. Our findings highlight that environmental factors regulate the variation in PUE through their effects on vegetative ANPP and COV.

The Inner Mongolia reach of the Yellow River Basin (IM-YRB) is a typical dryland with pervasive vegetation restoration through the actions of the ecological projects that have been conducted in recent years. However, how climate changes and human activities, such as land use and land cover (LULC) changes, jointly impact vegetation variations in this region remains poorly understood. Here, using an explainable machine learning technique, we evaluated linkages between the kernel normalized difference vegetation index (kNDVI) and air temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, and LULC changes, and relevant marginal contributions of these four drivers to the observed vegetation changes. The grassland fraction on a pixel level was selected as the quantitative LULC variable due to its key role in regional LULC. We found that interannual kNDVI changes in most areas of this study region were negatively sensitive to temperature, but positively sensitive to precipitation and soil moisture, with area fractions of 71.74%, 96.93%, and 89.33%, respectively. The area fraction of negative kNDVI sensitivity to LULC was roughly equivalent to that of positive kNDVI sensitivity. The contributions of air temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, and LULC to overall kNDVI changes were 21.54%, 33.32%, 32.19%, and 12.95%, respectively. Moisture conditions also play a critical role in vegetation changes, which was reflected by the fluctuating growth of kNDVI as interannual changes in precipitation. Nonetheless, kNDVI changes are also affected by LULC, and LULC became the dominant factor behind the kNDVI anomalies over the grassland restoration regions from barren over the IM-YRB. This research provides theoretical support for dryland vegetation restoration under the influence of climate change.

Robust ecological drought projections for drylands in the 21st century	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Dryland ecosystems may be especially vulnerable to expected 21st century increases in temperature and aridity because they are tightly controlled by moisture availability. However, climate impact assessments in drylands are difficult because ecological dynamics are dictated by drought conditions that are difficult to define and complex to estimate from climate conditions alone. In addition, precipitation projections vary substantially among climate models, enhancing variation in overall trajectories for aridity. Here, we constrain this uncertainty by utilizing an ecosystem water balance model to quantify drought conditions with recognized ecological importance, and by identifying changes in ecological drought conditions that are robust among climate models, defined here as when >90% of models agree in the direction of change. Despite limited evidence for robust changes in precipitation, changes in ecological drought are robust over large portions of drylands in the United States and Canada. Our results suggest strong regional differences in long-term drought trajectories, epitomized by chronic drought increases in southern areas, notably the Upper Gila Mountains and South-Central Semi-arid Prairies, and decreases in the north, particularly portions of the Temperate and West-Central Semi-arid Prairies. However, we also found that exposure to hot-dry stress is increasing faster than mean annual temperature over most of these drylands, and those increases are greatest in northern areas. Robust shifts in seasonal drought are most apparent during the cool season; when soil water availability is projected to increase in northern regions and decrease in southern regions. The implications of these robust drought trajectories for ecosystems will vary geographically, and these results provide useful insights about the impact of climate change on these dryland ecosystems. More broadly, this approach of identifying robust changes in ecological drought may be useful for other assessments of climate impacts in drylands and provide a more rigorous foundation for making long-term strategic resource management decisions.

However, a spatial-detailed and high-precision remote sensing method for the identification of desert vegetation-habitat complexes and characterization of their biophysical processes remain scarce. Here, we developed an innovative cross-wavelet transform (XWT)-based approach coupled with logistic regression to extract critical vegetation-habitat interaction characteristics in order to identify, map, and understand their complex ecological processes. Fine intraannual profiles between the green vegetation (GV) fraction and habitat fractions including dark material (DA), saline land (SA), sand land (SL) were unmixed by Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) from 16-period Gaofen-1 (GF-1) wide field of view (WFV) images in Minqin County, after which XWT was performed to extract feedback characteristics as feature parameters. Major principal components (PCs) were obtained from those feature parameters to reduce dimensions and solve multi-collinearity, logistic regression was applied for mapping. The results demonstrate that the proposed procedure efficiently reproduced desert vegetation-habitat complexes with high accuracy (overall accuracy: 87.33%; Kappa coefficient: 0.86) in the entire Minqin County, representing a 3.42% overall accuracy increase relative to a previously published decision tree (DT) method. The new method also had a lower quantity and allocation disagreement. Moreover, this procedure not only achieved comparable accuracy to that of an optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM) and superior to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based U-net model, but also explored biophysical processes and complex relationships with better interpretability. Therefore, the developed approach has the potential for accurately monitoring the highly heterogeneous dryland landscape and characterizing the land degradation processes in the spectral endmember space of fine spatial-temporal remote sensing data.						, Qiangqiang Sun/0000-0003-2017-6743													0034-4257	1879-0704				JAN	2020	236								111516	10.1016/j.rse.2019.111516	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.111516													WOS:000502894400008

Within drylands, the soil nutrient and organic carbon (C) cycling that does occur is often mediated by soil surface communities known as biological soil crusts (biocrusts), which cycle C and nutrients in the top ca. 0-2 cm of soil. However, the degree to which biocrusts are influencing soil fertility and biogeochemical cycling in deeper, subsurface mineral soils is unclear. The movement of dissolved resources from biocrusts to deeper soil layers in leachate may be one of the main mechanisms through which biocrust fertility is transferred downward towards deeper microbial communities and plant roots occurring within mineral soil. Here we examined the role of biocrust leachate in contributing to subsurface nutrient and soluble C pools and subsurface microbial cycling. We collected biocrusts from three biocrust successional stages and explored resource pools in situ at multiple soil depths, while collecting leachate and measuring nutrient and organic C concentrations and metabolite composition from each successional stage in the laboratory. After four leachate collections, we conducted an incubation of mineral soil collected from below each biocrust successional stage to measure heterotrophic microbial CO2 flux and biomass. Overall, our findings observed that the degree of nutrient and C connectivity between biocrusts and the sub-crust mineral soil depended on the biocrust successional stage and the element being considered, and the influence of biocrust successional stage on mineral soil CO2 flux is likely related to long-term resource build up. Together, our results suggest that the influence of biocrust leachate on subsurface mineral soil is complex and context dependent, but, over longer time periods and at later successional stages, can have measurable effects on dryland soil biogeochemical cycling with feedbacks to resource availability and CO2 flux.

Natural resource management (NRM) interventions offer an important path to sustainable agricultural practices through increasing resource use efficiency, but true efficacy will only be achievable if these initiatives can be scaled up. This paper explores the impact of farm-scale NRM interventions undertaken in the state of Karnataka, India, between 2005 and 2020. NRM technologies such as soil health management, resource use efficiency and improved crop cultivars were demonstrated in more than 50 000 farmers' fields. Participatory demonstrations and capacity building initiatives were effectively used to co-create innovations for rapid and wide dissemination, and NRM practices involving the soil-nutrient-crop-water continuum were the subject of large-scale demonstrations. The demonstration fields were divided into treated and control fields, and efforts were made to measure cost of cultivation, irrigation application and crop yield. The soil health management interventions helped to enhance crop yield by 10%-60% over the control plots. Technologies specific to resource conservation have helped to conserve soil moisture, reduce irrigation requirement by 50-300 mm and reduce the cost of cultivation by US$ 150 ha(-1). Improved cereal, pulse and oil seed cultivars increased crop yield minimum by 15%. Although these results have a large variability, they consistently showed the effectiveness of integrating NRM practices with crop demonstrations. These results are ideal for sensitizing stakeholders and policymakers to the benefits of adopting science-based approaches to NRM interventions in order to bridge yield gaps and address land degradation, food insecurity and poverty in dryland regions in South Asia and globally.

Climate-groundwater dynamics inferred from GRACE and the role of hydraulic memory	EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS												Groundwater is the largest store of freshwater on Earth after the cryosphere and provides a substantial proportion of the water used for domestic, irrigation and industrial purposes. Knowledge of this essential resource remains incomplete, in part, because of observational challenges of scale and accessibility. Here we examine a 14-year period (2002-2016) of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) observations to investigate climate-groundwater dynamics of 14 tropical and sub-tropical aquifers selected from WHYMAP's (Worldwide Hydrogeological Mapping and Assessment Programme) 37 large aquifer systems of the world. GRACE-derived changes in groundwater storage resolved using GRACE Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) mascons and the Community Land Model's land surface model are related to precipitation time series and regional-scale hydrogeology. We show that aquifers in dryland environments exhibit long-term hydraulic memory through a strong correlation between groundwater storage changes and annual precipitation anomalies integrated over the time series; aquifers in humid environments show short-term memory through strong correlation with monthly precipitation. This classification is consistent with estimates of groundwater response times calculated from the hydrogeological properties of each system, with long (short) hydraulic memory associated with slow (rapid) response times. The results suggest that groundwater systems in dryland environments may be less sensitive to seasonal climate variability but vulnerable to long-term trends from which they will be slow to recover. In contrast, aquifers in humid regions may be more sensitive to climate disturbances such as drought related to the El Nifio-Southern Oscillation but may also be relatively quick to recover. Exceptions to this general pattern are traced to human interventions through groundwater abstraction. Hydraulic memory is an important factor in the management of groundwater resources, particularly under climate change.

Forest and land fires are the primary sources of emissions in South Sumatra. In line with the national policy, South Sumatra Province commits to reduce emissions, including emissions from forest and land fires. This research was aimed to assess carbon loss affected by fire in 2015 that covered three districts in South Sumatra, i.e. Musi Banyuasin, Banyuasin, and Musi Rawas. The study was conducted by re-measurement of carbon stocks plots on four forests and land types, i.e. secondary peat swamp forest, secondary dryland forest, bushes swamp, and forest plantation. Carbon stocks measuring was conducted on sample plots in a rectangular shape of 20 m x 50 m of size for various types of natural forests and circle shape with a radius of 11.29 m (0.04 ha) and 7.98 m (0.02 ha) respectively for forest plantations of < 4 years and > 4 years old. Furthermore, carbon stocks in each plot were measured for three carbon pools of above-ground biomass, deadwood and litter. The result shows that carbon loss was varying with each forest and land type. The most significant number of carbon loss occurred on secondary peat swamp forest of 94.2 t/ha that is equivalent to the emission of 345.4 t CO(2)eq. The second-largest carbon loss occurred on secondary dryland forest of 36.3 t/ha followed by forest plantation and bushes swamp of 18.5 t/ha and 13.5 t/ha, respectively. The enormous carbon loss on secondary peat swamp forest and forest plantation occurred on above-ground biomass pool but in secondary dry forest and bushes swamp occurred on the deadwood pool.

A case study is used for the application of the integrated MIKE SHE model to investigate temporal and spatial dynamics of water and salinity in a small ephemeral catchment in southwestern Victoria, Australia. MIKE SHE was successfully calibrated and validated against experimental data of streamflow, groundwater levels, and salt discharged from the catchment. Projections of climatic conditions, adopting Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5, were used to infer how salinity discharge and concentrations might be affected across a range of greenhouse gas emission scenarios with different severity. The calibration of the water fluxes was solely based on parameters associated with the model of evapotranspiration, with other parameters selected from field observations and literature. The calibrated parameters for the salt transport were the longitudinal and lateral dispersivities. The calibration and validation of streamflow series led to Index of Agreement (IoA) of 0.92 and 0.8 respectively, while the simulation of groundwater levels was more challenging (IoA ranging from 0.22 to 0.89). Parameter equifinality was observed, with different parameter sets achieving a good fit of streamflow and groundwater levels, although leading to differing spatial patterns of evapotranspiration rates. Calibration and validation of the discharge concentrations appeared more difficult (IoA of 0.35 for calibration and 0.44 for validation) as they are affected by errors in the simulated flow. Climate projections RCP 8.5 suggested a reduction of salt discharge with consequent increased concentrations within the catchment. The study showed the ability of MIKE SHE to be successfully applied to intermittent dry catchments to possibly support water and land management.

Warming can increase soil organic C (SOC) by enhancing primary production, but it can also cause carbon release from soils. However, the role of warming in governing cropland SOC dynamics over broad geographic scales remains poorly understood. Using over 4000 soil samples collected in the 1980s and 2010s across the Sichuan Basin of China, this study assessed the warming-induced cropland SOC change and the correlations with precipitation, cropland type and soil type. Results showed mean SOC content increased from 11.10 to 13.85 g C kg(-1). Larger SOC increments were observed under drier conditions (precipitation < 1050 mm, dryland and paddy-dryland rotation cropland), which were 1.67-2.23 times higher than under wetter conditions (precipitation > 1050 mm and paddy fields). Despite the significant associations of SOC increment with crop productivity, precipitation, fertilization, cropland type and soil type, warming also acted as one of major contributors to cropland SOC change. The SOC increment changed parabolically with the rise in temperature increase rate under relatively drier conditions, while temperature increase had no impact on cropland SOC increment under wetter conditions. Meanwhile, the patterns of the parabolical relationship varied with soil types in drylands, where the threshold of temperature increase rate, the point at which the SOC increment switched from increasing to decreasing with warming, was lower for clayey soils (Ali-Perudic Argosols) than for sandy soils (Purpli-Udic Cambosols). These results illustrate divergent responses of cropland SOC to warming under different environments, which were contingent on water conditions and soil types. Our findings emphasize the importance of formulating appropriate field water management for sustainable C sequestration and the necessity of incorporating environment-specific mechanisms in Earth system models for better understanding of the soil C-climate feedback in complex environments.

Biocrust-forming lichens, such as the globally distributed Diploschistes diacapsis, are particularly affected and show a decrease in cover with simulated climate change. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, and long-term interacting effects of different drivers are largely unknown due to the short-term nature of the experimental studies conducted so far. We addressed this gap and successfully parameterised a process-based model for D. diacapsis to quantify how changing atmospheric CO2, temperature, rainfall amount and relative humidity affect its photosynthetic activity and cover. We also mimicked a long-term manipulative climate change experiment to understand the mechanisms underlying observed patterns in the field. The model reproduced observed experimental findings: warming reduced lichen cover, whereas less rainfall had no effect on lichen performance. This warming effect was caused by the associated decrease in relative humidity and non-rainfall water inputs, which are major water sources for biocrust-forming lichens. Warming alone, however, increased cover because higher temperatures promoted photosynthesis during early morning hours with high lichen activity. When combined, climate variables showed non-additive effects on lichen cover, and effects of increased CO2 levelled off with decreasing levels of relative humidity. Synthesis. Our results show that a decrease in relative humidity, rather than an increase in temperature, may be the key factor for the survival of the lichen D. diacapsis under climate change and that effects of increased CO2 levels might be offset by a reduction in non-rainfall water inputs in the future. Because of a global trend towards warmer and drier air and the widespread global distribution of D. diacapsis, this will affect lichen-dominated dryland biocrust communities and their role in regulating ecosystem functions worldwide.

However, little information is available on the effects of aeration, and even less on solutions that use bubble flow and their agronomic effects. In this study, the effects of aeration intensity on plants were studied through cultivation experiments and flow field visualization. It was found that the growth of plants did not increase linearly with an increase in aeration intensity. From the results of this study, when the aeration intensity was within the low range (0.07-0.15 L & BULL;L-1 NS & BULL;min(-1)), increasing the aeration intensity increased the plant growth. However, after the aeration intensity reached a certain extent (0.15-1.18 L & BULL;L-1 NS & BULL;min(-1)), some indicators did not change significantly. When the aeration intensity continued to increase (1.18-2.35 L & BULL;L-1 NS & BULL;min(-1)), growth began to decrease. These results show that for increasing dissolved oxygen and promoting plant growth, the rule is not "the higher the aeration intensity, the better ". There is a reasonable range of aeration intensity within which crops grow normally and rapidly. In addition, increasing the aeration intensity means increasing energy utilization and operating costs. In actual hydroponics production, it is very important to find a reasonable aeration intensity range.

Meandering rivers in modern desert basins: Implications for channel planform controls and prevegetation rivers	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The influence of biotic processes in controlling the development of meandering channels in fluvial systems is controversial. The majority of the depositional history of the Earth's continents was devoid of significant biogeomorphic interactions, particularly those between vegetation and sedimentation processes. The prevailing perspective has been that prevegetation meandering channels rarely developed and that rivers with braided planforms dominated. However, recently acquired data demonstrate that meandering channel planforms are more widely preserved in prevegetation fluvial successions than previously thought. Understanding the role of prevailing fluvial dynamics in non- and poorly vegetated environments must rely on actualistic models derived from presently active rivers developed in sedimentary basins subject to desert-climate settings, the sparsest vegetated regions experiencing active sedimentation on Earth. These systems have fluvial depositional settings that most closely resemble those present in prevegetation (and extra-terrestrial) environments. Here, we present an analysis based on satellite imagery which reveals that rivers with meandering channel planforms are common in modern sedimentary basins in desert settings. Morphometric analysis of meandering fluvial channel behaviour, where vegetation is absent or highly restricted, shows that modern sparsely and non-vegetated meandering rivers occur across a range of slope gradients and basin settings, and possess a broad range of channel and meander-belt dimensions. The importance of meandering rivers in modem desert settings suggests that their abundance is likely underestimated in the prevegetation rock record, and models for recognition of their deposits need to be improved.

An Approach to Land Productivity Dynamics Assessment: A Case Study of Rajasthan Region, India	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Land degradation is one of the major threats faced globally, affecting arid and other dryland areas severely. In such areas, biomass productivity is a function of precipitation to a large extent. This paper discusses methodology developed to generate land productivity dynamics assessment map using vegetation precipitation relationship residuals as proxy parameter to land degradation using long-term time series of satellite-derived Normalised Vegetation Difference Index and climate model-based precipitation data. This developed methodology rationally utilises information retrieved from statistical methods as well as qualitative measures.

Soil restoration increases soil health across global drylands: A meta-analysis	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Soil degradation is one of the greatest environmental issues our planet faces today, with over 33% of Earth's soils currently degraded. Drylands are especially vulnerable to soil degradation given their history of intensive land use and desertification. Active soil restoration has been identified as a leading strategy to combat soil degradation and promote ecosystem recovery. However, soil-based dryland restoration techniques have shown varying success, potentially due to a lack of understanding of the ecological contexts in which soil-based treatments are most beneficial. 2. To improve our understanding of how to best use active soil restoration to restore degraded drylands, we conducted a global meta-analysis of soil treatment effectiveness at improving soil health across varying environmental gradients. The soil health metrics we analysed were aggregate stability, bulk density, soil moisture, soil organic carbon (SOC), soil nitrogen, mycorrhizal colonization and basal respiration. For this meta-analysis we collected 155 publications, yielding 1403 unique studies spanning six continents. 3. We found that overall, soil restoration had a beneficial effect on all measures of soil health ranging from a +11% increase in bulk density (inverse) to a +6967% increase in mycorrhizal colonization. Aridity and soil texture greatly influenced restoration effectiveness for certain soil health metrics. Specifically, for soil carbon and nitrogen, restoration was found to be most effective in arid, fine-textured soils and mesic, coarse-textured soils. Additionally, we found that organic amendments were most effective at increasing SOC, while fungi inoculation was most effective at increasing mycorrhizal colonization. 4. Synthesis and applications: Our findings indicate that active soil restoration is an effective tool for increasing soil health and provide information on optimal treatments and site conditions for improving certain aspects of soil health. This could greatly help inform decision-making, and thus improve outcomes, in dryland restoration worldwide.

J	Yu, XJ; Zhang, LX; Zhou, TJ; Zheng, JH				Yu, Xiaojing; Zhang, Lixia; Zhou, Tianjun; Zheng, Jianghua			Assessing the Performance of CMIP6 Models in Simulating Droughts across Global Drylands	ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												Both the attribution of historical change and future projections of droughts rely heavily on climate modeling. However, reasonable drought simulations have remained a challenge, and the related performances of the current state-of-the-art Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) models remain unknown. Here, both the strengths and weaknesses of CMIP6 models in simulating droughts and corresponding hydrothermal conditions in drylands are assessed. While the general patterns of simulated meteorological elements in drylands resemble the observations, the annual precipitation is overestimated by similar to 33% (with a model spread of 2.3%-77.2%), along with an underestimation of potential evapotranspiration (PET) by similar to 32% (17.5%-17.2%). The water deficit condition, measured by the difference between precipitation and PET, is 50% (29.1%-71.7%) weaker than observations. The CMIP6 models show weaknesses in capturing the climate mean drought characteristics in drylands, particularly with the occurrence and duration largely underestimated in the hyperarid Afro-Asian areas. Nonetheless, the drought-associated meteorological anomalies, including reduced precipitation, warmer temperatures, higher evaporative demand, and increased water deficit conditions, are reasonably reproduced. The simulated magnitude of precipitation (water deficit) associated with dryland droughts is overestimated by 28% (24%) compared to observations. The observed increasing trends in drought fractional area, occurrence, and corresponding meteorological anomalies during 1980-2014 are reasonably reproduced. Still, the increase in drought characteristics, associated precipitation and water deficit are obviously underestimated after the late 1990s, especially for mild and moderate droughts, indicative of a weaker response of dryland drought changes to global warming in CMIP6 models. Our results suggest that it is imperative to employ bias correction approaches in drought-related studies over drylands by using CMIP6 outputs.

Yield and Overall Productivity under Long-Term Wheat-Based Crop Rotations: 2000 through 2016	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Crop rotation is a proven sustainable cropping system in dryland production. However, finding the most compatible crops, in terms of maximizing yield, quality, and profitability, is a continuous process. The objective of our study was to identify compatible crop sequences and evaluate the overall productivity of potential crop rotation systems in the central Great Plains. This long-term study was conducted from 2000 through 2016 near Tribune, KS. Four summer crops [corn (Zea mays L.) (C), grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) (GS), soybean (Glycine max L.) (SB), and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) (SF)] along with winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (W) were grown in one-, two-, three-, and four-year rotations, with most rotations including a fallow (F) phase. Rotations were W-C-SB-F, W-F, W-C-SF-F, W-GS-F, W-SF-F, and W-C-GS-F from 2000 through 2006 and W-C-F, continuous GS, W-F, W-GS-C-F, W-GS-F, and W-C-GS-F from 2008 through 2016. Both annual and average corn and grain sorghum yields were greater in rotations where the summer crops were preceded by wheat rather than another summer crop. Annual wheat yield did not differ across rotations but tended to be lower in the 4-yr rotations where two summer crops were involved and lowest in the W-C-SF-F system. Grain sorghum had a higher probability for greatest yield. Overall, W-GS-F was the most productive rotation followed by W-GS-C-F. In semiarid regions where water is limited, dryland producers should make their decisions based on both crop yield potential and sequence that provide the best utilization of the most limiting resource.

The predicted increase in aridity will expand the biocrust cover and significantly impact soil organic C dynamics. However, how biocrusts change soil organic C decomposition and what factors drive the effect in response to climate warming remains largely unknown at a continental scale. We measured microbial respiration and its temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) in bare soil lacking biocrusts and two universal biocrusted soils (cyanobacterial- and moss-crusted soil) from 43 sites across a precipitation gradient from 39 to 443 mm to evaluate the relative effects of biocrusts on Q(10) and the driving forces in northern China's dryland. Microbial respiration increased and Q(10) decreased with increasing precipitation in bare soil, cyanobacterial- and moss-crusted soil. Biocrusts positively affected microbial respiration, with a more substantial magnitude by moss crusts than cyanobacterial crusts. Biocrusts negatively impacted Q(10), and the magnitudes were similar between moss and cyanobacterial crusts. Most importantly, the relative effects of biocrusts on microbial respiration and Q(10) increased with decreasing precipitation. The positive effects of biocrusts on soil organic C content and microbial biomass carbon were positively correlated with the level of increased microbial respiration. Contrastingly, the magnitude of reduced Q(10) was attributed to the biocrusts' positive effects on soil organic C quality and adverse effects on the ratio of fungal to bacterial PLFAs (F:B). Our study provides strong evidence that biocrusts decrease the temperature sensitivity of microbial respiration in northern China's dryland. This result suggests that the predicted expanding biocrust cover is crucial for maintaining the soil organic C stability by buffering the positive impacts of climate warming on soil organic C decomposition in drylands.

Deconstructing precipitation variability: Rainfall event size and timing uniquely alter ecosystem dynamics	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Water-limited ecosystems are highly sensitive to not only precipitation amount, but also precipitation pattern, particularly variability in the size and timing of growing season rainfall events. Both rainfall event size and timing are expected to be altered by climate change, but the relative responses of dryland ecosystems to changes in rainfall event size versus timing have not been resolved. Here, we disentangle the effects of these different aspects of precipitation pattern on ecosystem dynamics. We experimentally assessed how these two aspects of rainfall variability impacted a semi-arid grassland ecosystem by altering an ambient precipitation pattern to eliminate variability in (a) rainfall event size (all events were made the same size), (b) rainfall event timing (all events were uniformly spaced in time) and (c) both. Total precipitation amount was constant for all treatments. We measured responses of soil moisture, ecosystem carbon flux (e.g. net primary production and soil CO2 flux), plant community composition and physiological responses of the dominant C-4 grass, Bouteloua gracilis. Removing variability in rainfall event size altered ecosystem dynamics more than a pattern of uniform event timing, but the largest impact occurred when variability in both were removed. Notably, eliminating variability in both event size and timing increased above-ground net primary productivity by 23%, consistent with reduced water stress in the dominant C-4 grass, while also reducing seasonal variability in soil CO2 flux by 35%, reflecting lower seasonal variability in soil moisture. Synthesis. Unique responses to different aspects of precipitation variability highlight the complexity of predicting how dryland ecosystems will be affected by climate change-induced shifts in rainfall patterns. Our results provide novel support for the key roles of rainfall event size and timing, in addition to total precipitation amount, as determinants of ecosystem function.

Aerobic Rice with or without Strategic Irrigation in the Subtropics	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Modern rice varieties adapted to aerobic (dryland) conditions have expanded to new rice growing systems thanks to their plasticity in adapting to rainfed and irrigated conditions. This is important because, as water becomes scarce in paddy rice regions (as it is already in Australia), there will be a move towards tropical to subtropical dryland rainfed rice with attendant problems of drought and low temperature. To assess rice adaptability in the wet season of the semi-arid subtropical conditions of coastal central Queensland, field experiments were established for a late season (in January) planting in 2014 and early season planting in November 2015 with 13 varieties developed by Australian Agriculture Technologies (AAT) Ltd were seeded in a vertisol soil. This was to assess their adaptation to rainfed conditions and their response to strategic irrigation. Water scarcity and low temperature prior to and at flowering were important factors constraining yield. Early flowering varieties in the late season planting escaped the otherwise cold and drought stress during the reproductive stage and had higher yields. In the second year, earlier planting made possible with strategic irrigation avoided the low temperature constraint on yield, but without follow-up strategic irrigation, yields were still low. The average yield of varieties increased from 1.5 times (AAT 4) to 16.3 times (AAT 15) with strategic irrigation compared with rainfed yields averaged across years. The increase in yield with strategic irrigation was associated with a greater leaf area index, spikelet fertility, and instantaneous water use efficiency during flowering. Strategic irrigation concentrated roots in the top 15 cm, but differences in yield between varieties under rainfed conditions were not related to root properties. It is important to consider variations in flowering time, yield potential, and drought patterns when developing rice varieties for rainfed semi-arid tropical conditions, as well as when quantifying the benefits of strategic irrigation.

J	Pérez-Rojas, J; Moreno, F; Quevedo, JC; Villa, J				Perez-Rojas, Jonathan; Moreno, Flavio; Cesar Quevedo, Julio; Villa, Jorge			Soil organic carbon stocks in fluvial and isolated tropical wetlands from Colombia	CATENA												Freshwater tropical wetlands are valuable sinks of carbon (C) on the global scale. While much attention has been paid to forested peatlands, little is known about C stored in tropical freshwater mineral soil wetlands dominated by herbaceous and macrophyte vegetation, specially its spatial variability at the ecosystem level. Here we study the soil organic carbon of two tropical lowland wetlands (fluvial and isolated), located in the interandean valley of the Magdalena river in Colombia. Soil cores were extracted from 11 sampling zones distributed in the two wetlands, including the dryland adjacent to each wetland. They were sectioned into 2 cm-depth increments that were analyzed for C content. The average bulk density was higher (P < 0.001) in the fluvial wetland (0.87 +/- 0.3 g cm(-3)) than in the isolated one (0.45 +/- 0.3 g cm(-3)), the concentration of C (% Cr) was higher (P < 0.001) in the isolated wetland (11.1 +/- 6.8%) than in the fluvial one (1.9 +/- 1.1%) as well as the average soil organic carbon (6.4 +/- 2.6 and 2.9 +/- 1.1 t C ha(-1) cm(-1), respectively). Per unit area, the fluvial wetland had about twice as much storage capacity of C as the dryland, while in the isolated wetland the ratio was up to five times higher. Hydrogeomorphology was an important factor for the C storage in these ecosystems. The fluctuating hydrodynamics of the fluvial wetland seems to favor aerobic conditions and thus the prevalence of aerobic over anaerobic decomposition, lowering accumulation of C. This study makes an important contribution towards the understanding of C dynamics in different types of tropical wetlands and brings data to support their conservation.

Dagmar was a selection from the cross MT1133/MT1148 and was tested as experimental line MT1621. Dagmar has similar grain yield potential to 'Vida', the most widely grown cultivar in Montana. Stems of Dagmar are more solid than those of Vida, suggesting increased resistance to the wheat stem sawfly (Cephus cinctus Norton). Dagmar has higher grain protein and stronger gluten than Vida. Thus, Dagmar should be useful in Montana and adjoining states facing drought and wheat stem sawfly pressure.

Geologic controls are the primary determinant of river character and behavior in the hinterland and pediment landscape units, where headwater streams transition to partly confined valleys and gorges with distinct structural lineations in a rectangular drainage network. Climate memory imprints entrenched rivers that make up alluvial fan and alluvial plain landscape units of the mid-lower catchment, shaped by phases of sediment aggradation and subsequent incision in response to enhanced monsoonal rains around 10 ka. Terraces constrain channels within confined and partly confined valleys with occasional and discontinuous floodplains respectively. Laterally unconfined channels are only found in the lower parts of the catchment, immediately upstream of the estuary/delta. Limited space for adjustment, impacts of flow regulation and ephemeral conditions restrict the range of contemporary river morphodynamics, but ridges and swales and abandoned channels on floodplains indicate more dynamic conditions in the past. Impacts of anthropogenic memory are most pronounced in the stopbank-controlled, barrage-and dam-impacted reaches, especially in the cities of Gandhinagar and Ahmedabad. An explanation of controls upon geomorphic river diversity, including an assessment of the role of stream power, presents a coherent platform to develop geomorphologically-informed approaches to river management.

Forage productivity and soil properties in dual-purpose cover crop systems	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Intensification of dryland cropping systems with cover crops (CCs) in the semi-arid central Great Plains could enhance soil health and diversify production when used for forage. This study was conducted from 2015 to 2020 to determine forage mass, nutritive value of CCs, and effects of dual-purpose CCs on soil properties in a no-till winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]-fallow cropping system. Treatments were oat (Avena sativa L.)/triticale (x Triticosecale Wittm.) CCs grown in place of fallow, which were hayed, grazed by yearling heifers, or left standing. Forage mass varied across years and averaged 3,546 kg ha(-1) for standing CCs. Hayed and grazed CCs removed 73 and 26% of available forage. Soil bulk density was unaffected by haying or grazing compared to standing CCs. Soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in the 0-to-15-cm depth in 2019 were similar among CC treatments (27.31 Mg ha(-1)). Stocks with standing and hayed CCs were greater than fallow (24.79 Mg ha(-1)) which was similar to grazed CCs. However, in 2020, stocks were less with hayed CCs (21.80 Mg ha(-1)) compared to grazed or standing CCs (24.27 Mg ha(-1)) and all were similar to fallow. Mean weight diameter of water stable aggregates increased with standing and grazed CCs (2.89 mm) compared to fallow (1.67 mm) in both years but hayed CCs were greater than fallow in 1 yr. Findings suggest CCs can replace fallow to produce high-quality forage while improving soil health but residue management is critical when CC productivity is low.

This study investigated the impacts of both average climate change (ACC) (i.e., average precipitation, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration [PET]) and extreme climate change (ECC) (i.e., five precipitation and five tempera-ture extremes) on dryland vegetation based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The spatial diver-gences of ACC and ECC in affecting changes in NDVI over drylands were determined using the geographical detector model. In this study, the growth of vegetation in 40.29 % of global drylands was driven by average precipitation and this dominant effect also occurred in all the plant species, particularly shrubs. However, the sensitivity of grassland to average precipitation exceeded that of most of the woody vegetation. The average temperature and PET controlled 28.64 % and 31.07 % of the changes in NDVI, respectively. Precipitation extremes (except for consecutive dry days and consecutive wet days) and warm temperature extremes (WTE) had positive influences on dryland vegetation, and the effect of WTE on NDVI exceeded that of the remaining temperature extremes. Temperature extremes exerted more significant effects than precipitation extremes for changes in the grassland NDVI. In contrast, the variations in shrub NDVI were primarily dominated by precipitation extremes. We also found that the impacts of parts of average and extreme climatic factors on vegetation had changed over time. Furthermore, temperature extremes had far exceeded the average temperature in affecting vegetation growth at the spatial scale, and this action gradually inten-sified from 1982 to 2015. The influences of all precipitation extremes were weaker than those of the average precip-itation. Those can offer scientific references for ecosystem protection in drylands.

However, aboveground production tends to increase more than belowground biomass, and in no-till systems SOM responses to irrigation would strongly depend on the fate of crop residues left on the soil surface. Litter decomposition and SOM formation can also be affected by irrigation due to changes in water dynamics, but little is known about the impacts of irrigation on the pathways of SOM formation. We used dual C-13 and N-15 labeled maize litter to quantify the effect of irrigation on the contribution of aboveground crop residues to SOM formation in semiarid, no-till agricultural systems. We incubated the litter in a continuous maize cropping system with two treatments, dryland and irrigated, and measured litter decomposition and its contribution to different SOM pools. Irrigation had a larger effect on litter C and N losses than on the formation of new SOM. After 13 months the C and N losses from the litter layer were 24% higher under irrigation, but there were no treatment differences in the litter-derived C and N recovered in SOM. Most of the litter-derived organic matter (OM) was found in the mineral associated OM pool (MAOM), but irrigation did not affect the amount of litter-derived OM found as MAOM or as particulate organic matter. Irrigation increased the amount of litter-derived OM found in macroaggregates, and this observation was more related to a higher aggregation than to aggregate enrichment in the irrigated treatment. Our results suggest that a smaller proportion of aboveground crop residues will form SOM in irrigated systems compared to dryland conditions and may help to partially explain why irrigation has a stronger relative effect on crop productivity and C inputs than on SOC stocks in semiarid agricultural systems.

Earlier plant growth helps compensate for reduced carbon fixation after 13 years of warming	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												Drylands play a dominant role in global carbon cycling and are particularly vulnerable to increasing temperatures, but our understanding of how dryland ecosystems will respond to climatic change remains notably poor. Considering that the area of drylands is projected to increase by 11%-23% by 2,100, understanding the impacts of warming on the functions and services furnished by these arid and semi-arid ecosystems has numerous implications. In a unique 13-year ecosystem warming experiment in a south-western U.S. dryland, we investigated the consequences of rising temperature on Achnatherum hymenoides, a widespread, keystone grass species on the Colorado Plateau. We tracked individual- and population-level responses to identify optimal strategies that may have been masked if considering only one level of plant response. We found several factors combined to affect the timing and magnitude of plant responses during the 13th year of warming. These included large warming-induced biomass increases for individual plants, an 8.5-day advancement in the growing season and strong reductions in photosynthetic rates and population cover. Importantly, we observed a lack of photosynthetic acclimation and, thus, a warming-induced downregulation of photosynthetic rates. However, these physiological responses were concurrent with warmed-plant increases in growing season length and investment in photosynthetic surfaces, demonstrating the species' ability to balance carbon fixation limitations with warming. These results, which bring together ecophysiological, phenological, reproductive and morphological assessments of plant responses to warming, suggest that the extent of change in A. hymenoides populations will be based upon numerous adaptive responses that vary in their direction and magnitude. Plant population responses to climatic warming remain poorly resolved, particularly for Earth's drylands, and our in situ experiment assessing multiple strategies offers a novel look into a warmer world.

Effects of grazing and enclosure management on soil physical and chemical properties vary with aridity in China's drylands	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Dryland soils are nutrient-poor and prone to degradation due to aridity, grazing and enclosure. It is essential to exam-ine the effects of grazing and enclosure on aridity-induced soil degradation in dryland ecosystems to optimize land management practices in response to climate change. However, quantitative evaluation on this topic is scarce due to a lack of long-term field monitoring data. This study evaluated the combined effects of aridity and grazing/enclosure using long-term data (2005-2015) from three research stations on soil physical and chemical properties in typical steppes and desert steppes across the semi-arid and hyper-arid areas of China's drylands. Results showed that soil or-ganic matter (OM) content was higher for enclosures (20.50 g/kg) than for grazing (19.06 g/kg). In the semi-arid steppe, enclosures aged 30-33 years had the highest soil total nitrogen (TN) content (1.21 g/kg). Longer enclosures aged 34-36 years showed decreased soil TN content (0.88 g/kg). In the desert steppe, enclosures aged 5-8 years ex-hibited the highest soil OM (2.44 g/kg) and TN (0.21 g/kg) contents. Grazing enhanced the decrease of OM content (from 4.57 to 2.39 g/kg) with increasing aridity (1 - aridity index) from 0.35 to 1. These findings indicate that enclo-sures can improve soil fertility, but prolonged enclosures may have negative effects. Grazing had a synergistic effect on the decrease of OM with aridity. Results can be used in response to climate changes to formulate sustainable land man-agement strategies, such as reducing the enclosure period in wetter and restored areas, and diminishing the grazing intensity in areas with higher aridity.

Body size dictates physiological and behavioural responses to hypoxia and elevated water temperatures in Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii)	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY												Increasing drought frequency and duration pose a significant threat to fish species in dryland river systems. As ectotherms, fish thermal and hypoxia tolerances directly determine the capacity of species to persist in these environments during low flow periods when water temperatures are high and waterbodies become highly stratified. Chronic thermal stress can compound the impacts of acute hypoxic events on fish resulting in significant fish mortality; however, it is not known if all size classes are equally susceptible, or if the allometric scaling of physiological processes means some size classes are disproportionately affected. We investigated the physiological responses of Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii) over a four-fold body size range (0.2-3000 g) to acute changes in water temperature and oxygen concentration following 4 weeks of acclimation to representative spring (20 degrees C) and summer (28 degrees C) water temperatures. We recorded maximum thermal tolerance (CTmax), oxygen limited thermal tolerance (PCTmax), lowest tolerable oxygen level (as the oxygen level at which lose equilibrium; O-2,O-LOE), gill ventilation rates and aerial surface respiration threshold, blood oxygen transport capacity and lactate accumulation. Acclimation to elevated water temperatures improved thermal and hypoxia tolerance metrics across all size classes. However, body size significantly affected thermal and hypoxia responses. Small M. peelii were significantly less hypoxia tolerant than larger individuals, while larger fish were significantly less thermal tolerant than smaller fish. Hypoxia constrained thermal tolerance in M. peelii, with both small and large fish disproportionally compromised relative to mid-sized fish. Our findings indicate that both very small/young (larvae, fry, fingerlings) and very large/older M. peelii in dryland rivers are at significant risk from the combined impacts of a warming and drying climate and water extraction. These data will inform policy decisions that serve to balance competing demands on precious freshwater resources.

J	Eigentler, L				Eigentler, L.			Species coexistence in resource-limited patterned ecosystems is facilitated by the interplay of spatial self-organisation and intraspecific competition	OIKOS												The exploration of mechanisms that enable species coexistence under competition for a sole limiting resource is widespread across ecology. Two examples of such facilitative processes are intraspecific competition and spatial self-organisation. These processes determine the outcome of competitive dynamics in many resource-limited patterned ecosystems, classical examples of which include dryland vegetation patterns, intertidal mussel beds and subalpine ribbon forests. Previous theoretical investigations have explained coexistence within patterned ecosystems by making strong assumptions on the differences between species (e.g. contrasting dispersal behaviours or different functional responses to resource availability). In this paper, I show that the interplay between the detrimental effects of intraspecific competition and the facilitative nature of self-organisation forms a coexistence mechanism that does not rely on species-specific assumptions and captures coexistence across a wide range of the environmental stress gradient. I use a theoretical model that captures the interactions of two generic consumer species with an explicitly modelled resource to show that coexistence relies on a balance between species' colonisation abilities and their local competitiveness, provided intraspecific competition is sufficiently strong. Crucially, the requirements on species' self-limitation for coexistence to occur differ on opposite ends of the resource input spectrum. For low resource levels, coexistence is facilitated by strong intraspecific dynamics of the species superior in its colonisation abilities, but for larger volumes of resource input, strong intraspecific competition of the locally superior species enables coexistence. Results presented in this paper also highlight the importance of hysteresis in understanding tipping points, in particular extinction events. Finally, the theoretical framework provides insights into spatial species distributions within single patches, supporting verbal hypotheses on coexistence of herbaceous and woody species in dryland vegetation patterns and suggesting potential empirical tests in the context of other patterned ecosystems.

We compared sheep grazing, tillage, and herbicide application as weed management practices on soil total C (STC), total N (STN), ammonium (NH4+)-N, and nitrate (NO3-)-N contents in a dryland 5-year crop rotation from 2012 to 2015 in the northern Great Plains, USA. The treatments were sheep grazing with no chemical input in organic crop production (GO), minimum tillage with chemical inputs (MT), and conventional tillage with no chemical input in organic crop production (TO). The 5-year crop rotation was safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.)/sweet clover (Melilotus officinalis L.) cover crop-sweet clover cover crop-winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-lentil (Lens culinaris L.)-winter wheat. At the 0-1.20 m depth, STC was 14-20 Mg C ha(-1) greater in GO than MT and TO, but STN was 2.1-2.2 Mg N ha(-1) greater in TO than GO and MT. The NH4+-N and NO3--N contents were 5 21 kg N ha(-1) greater in MT than GO and TO. While STC and STN tended to increase with year for all treatments, NH4+-N and NO3--N contents varied with treatments and years. Sheep grazing enhanced soil C storage, but had a variable effect on N storage and residual N compared to tillage and herbicide application for weed control.

However, low vegetation cover and a lack of meteorological stations lead to uncertainties in vegetation modeling, and obstruct uncovering of driving degradation factors. We therefore analyzed the importance of promising variables, including soil-adjusted indices and high-resolution snow metrics, for vegetation quantification and classification in Afghanistan's Wakhan region using Sentinel-2 and field data with a random forest algorithm. To increase insights on remotely derived climate proxies, we incorporated a temporal correlation analysis of MODIS snow data (NDSI) compared to field measured vegetation and MODIS-NDVI anomalies. Repeated spatial cross-validation showed good performance of the classification (80-81% overall accuracy) and foliar vegetation model (R-2 0.77-0.8, RMSE 11.23-12.85). Omitting the spatial cross-validation approach led to a positive evaluation bias of 0.1 in the overall accuracy of the classification and 25% in RMSE of the cover models, demonstrating that studies not considering the spatial structure of environmental data must be treated with caution. The 500-repeated Boruta-algorithm highlighted MSACRI, MSAVI, NDVI and the short-wave infrared Band-12 as the most important variables. This indicates that, complementary to traditional indices, soil-adjusted variables and the short-wave infrared region are essential for vegetation modeling in cold grasslands. Snow variables also showed high importance but they did not improve the overall performance of the models. Single-variable models, which were restricted to areas with very low vegetation cover (<20%), resulted in poor performance of NDVI for cover prediction and better performance of snow variables. Our temporal analysis provides evidence that snow variables are important climate proxies by showing highly significant correlations of spring snow data with MODIS-NDVI during 2001-2020 (Pearson's r 0.68) and field measured vegetation during 2006, 2007, 2016 and 2018 (R 0.3). Strong spatial differences were visible with higher correlations in alpine grasslands (MODIS NDVI: 0.72, field data: 0.74) compared to other regions and lowest correlations in riparian grasslands. We thereby show new monitoring approaches to grassland dynamics that enable the development of sustainable management strategies, and the mitigation of threats affecting cold grasslands of Central Asia.					shuqian, liu/CAF-5267-2022	Zandler, Harald/0000-0001-5505-2455														2296-665X				MAR 3	2022	10								684589	10.3389/fenvs.2022.684589	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.684589													WOS:000773229100001

In this study, a diverse panel of 282 wheat accessions were phenotyped for grain number per spike (GNS), spikelet number (SN), basal sterile spikelet number (BSSN), and apical sterile spikelet number (ASSN) under different water regimes across two growing seasons. Correlation analysis showed that GNS is significantly correlated with both SN and BSSN under two water regimes. A total of 9,793 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from the 15 K wheat array were employed for genome-wide association study (GWAS). A total of 77 significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) for investigated traits as well as 8 MTAs for drought tolerance coefficient (DTC) were identified using the mixed linear model. Favored alleles for breeding were inferred according to their estimated effects on GNS, based on the mean difference of varieties. Frequency changes in favored alleles associated with GNS in modern varieties indicate there is still considerable genetic potential for their use as markers for genome selection of GNS in wheat breeding.																			1664-462X					JAN 26	2022	12								806295	10.3389/fpls.2021.806295	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.806295								35154198					WOS:000752835700001

Ecological mechanisms underlying aridity thresholds in global drylands	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. With ongoing climate change, the probability of crossing environmental thresholds promoting abrupt changes in ecosystem structure and functioning is higher than ever. In drylands (areas where it rains <65% of what could be potentially evaporated), recent research has shown how the crossing of three aridity thresholds [at aridity (1-Aridity Index) values of 0.54, 0.70 and 0.80] leads to abrupt changes on ecosystem structural and functional attributes. Despite the importance of these findings and their implications to develop effective monitoring and adaptation actions to combat climate change and desertification, we lack a proper understanding of the mechanisms unleashing these abrupt shifts. 2. Here we review multiple mechanisms that may explain the existence of aridity thresholds observed across global drylands, and discuss the potential amplification mechanisms that may underpin hypothetical abrupt temporal shifts with climate change. 3. We propose that each aridity threshold is caused by different and specific mechanisms. The first threshold is mainly caused by physiological mechanisms of plant adaptation to water shortages. The second threshold is unleashed by different mechanisms involving soil processes and plant-soil interactions such as soil erosion, plant community shifts and nutrient cycling and circulation. The collapse of vegetation observed once the third aridity threshold (0.8) is crossed is caused by the mechanisms related to the survival limits of plants that may cause sudden cover and diversity losses and plant-atmospheric feedbacks that link vegetation collapse with further climate aridification. 4. By identifying, revising and linking relevant mechanisms to each aridity threshold observed, we provide a set of specific hypotheses and identify knowledge gaps concerning the study of threshold emergence in drylands. We were also able to establish plausible factors that are context dependent and may influence the occurrence of abrupt ecosystem changes in time. Our review may help to focus future research efforts on aridity thresholds and to develop strategies to monitor, adapt to or even revert abrupt ecosystem changes across global drylands.

However, the methods for evaluating appearance throughout the year, such as plant color and growth activity, are not well understood. In this study, evergreen and winter-dormant parents of Phedimus takesimensis and 94 F1 plants were used for multispectral imaging. We took 16 multispectral image measurements from March 2019 to April 2020 and used them to calculate 15 vegetation indices and the area of plant cover. QTL analysis was also performed. Traits such as the area of plant cover and vegetation indices related to biomass were high during spring and summer (growth period), whereas vegetation indices related to anthocyanins were high in winter (dormancy period). According to the PCA, changes in the intensity of light reflected from the plants at different wavelengths over the course of a year were consistent with the changes in plant color and growth activity. Seven QTLs were found to be associated with major seasonal growth changes. This approach, which monitors not only at a single point in time but also over time, can reveal morphological changes during growth, senescence, and dormancy throughout the year.

Understanding the impacts of precipitation fluctuations on wheat production can provide insight into future crop production under climate change. We conducted an eight-year field experiment to estimate the effect of tillage (no-tillage, NT; deep tillage, DT; subsoiling, SS) system on the soil water consumption and nitrogen translocation to the wheat grains. Furthermore, we accessed the variation in wheat yield according to the wet, dry, and normal precipitation years in the Loess Plateau, China. The tillage improved the soil water content, N remobilization, and grain yield in comparison to NT. The soil water storage was significantly higher in 0-300 cm depth under DT than NT and SS. The changes in soil water content were highest in the years which received higher precipitation. The translocation and accumulation of N were higher in the normal years than the dry and wet years and more under DT and SS than the NT. Furthermore, pre-anthesis N translocation contributed more to grain N, whereas post-anthesis N accumulation did not significantly vary with the years and tillage. Thus, increasing soil moisture or precipitation rate compared to normal does not increase the soil water storage, N accumulation, and grain yield. Therefore, tillage proved beneficial in increasing yield by improving the soil water storage and N availability.

J	Brown, M; Heinse, R; Johnson-Maynard, J; Huggins, D				Brown, Meghan; Heinse, Robert; Johnson-Maynard, Jodi; Huggins, David			Time-lapse mapping of crop and tillage interactions with soil water using electromagnetic induction	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL												Assessing spatiotemporal variations in soil water is critical to many decisions in precision agriculture. In dryland crop production regions with marginal precipitation, growers use crop rotations and surface preparation practices to build soil water natural capital over preceding seasons for cash crop production. However, significant gaps exist in quantifying linkages between topography, soil properties, and site-specific agronomic practices to crop water use, and to predict temporal changes in soil water storage. In this study, we used time-lapse electromagnetic induction to measure apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) to infer spatiotemporal variability of soil water while comparing crop (winter wheat [Triticum aestivum L.], spring peas [Pisum sativum L.], and spring barley [Hordeum vulgare L.]) as well as tillage (no till and chisel plow) on a split-plot design in the Palouse region of northern Idaho. Weekly measurements of ECa were converted to soil water content using multiple linear regression with the help of principal component analysis. Separating factors of temporal stability and variability allowed us to derive crop-specific calibrated relationships between soil water content and the additional variables growing degree days, elevation, clay content, and silt content. Results suggest that spring peas retained the highest water content, followed by spring barley and winter wheat. Resultant maps show highly structured and consistent patterns in ECa being driven primarily by crop type that are apparent even in uncalibrated imagery. Although soil ECa tended to be greater in no-tillage compared with chisel plow treatments, we found no significant differences in soil water content between the two. This may be partially due to the limited number of years of no-till practice at this site.

However, the response of soil microbes to freezing and thawing, as well as their properties in drylands agroecosystems, remains unknown. This study investigated the effects of seasonal freezing and thawing on soil fungal and bacterial communities, multifunctionality, and soil microbial quality in a dryland agroecosystem. It has been observed that seasonal freezing and thawing promoted nutrient releases such as total carbon and available phosphorus. After thawing, soil catalase and cellulase activities increased while acid phosphatase and urease activities and total nitrogen content at topsoil decreased. Soil microbial biomass carbon content at 0-40 cm depth was significantly reduced by 94.77 %. Importantly, freezing and thawing considerably shifted the composition of fungal groups, while the soil bacterial community exhibited more stress tolerance to freezing-thawing. Compared to pre-freezing, the relative abundance of dominant fungal phyla such as Basidiomycota and Mortierellomycota decreased. At the same time, Ascomycota increased after thawing, and the relative abundance of pathogenic fungus also increased. For dominant bacteria phylum, freezing and thawing increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Gemmatimonadetes while Micrococcaceae declined. Freezing and thawing significantly increased bacterial diversity and evenness by 4.94 % and 4.19 %, respectively, but decreased fungal richness and diversity by 23.49 % and 14.91 %, respectively. The minimum and total data sets were used to evaluate soil quality and we found that freezing and thawing significantly negatively impacted soil multifunctionality and microbial quality. In summary, this study demonstrates that the seasonal freezing-thawing has a significant negative impact on soil microbial quality and multifunctionality, and accelerates soil degeneration in dryland agroecosystem.

Herein we assessed the rhizobacterial diversity, co-occurrence network connectivity, and assembly processes of dryland wheat rhizobacterial communities and its environmental drivers under a long-term crop rotation (maize-wheat, MW; soybean-wheat, SW) x soil tillage (chisel plow tillage, CPT; zero tillage, ZT; plow tillage, PT) system. The results indicated that crop rotation, soil tillage, and their interactions substantially affected the edaphic properties, where both CPT and ZT increased the levels of soil moisture, pH, organic carbon, and total nitrogen, and SW increased the levels of soil pH and total nitrogen. Compared with MW, SW increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria (5.82%), while decreased the relative abundances of Firmicutes (22.96%) and Patescibacteria (20.98%). Regardless of crop rotation, there were significant differences in the rhizobacterial community composition among three tillage practices. Rotation x tillage interaction exerted stronger effect on the community composition than their individual contributions. The rhizobacterial network was more densely connected under the SW (edges = 2555, density = 0.122) than that under the MW (edges = 1785, density = 0.082), and the network connectivity showed a decreasing tendency with decreasing tillage intensity. Crop rotation changed the proportions of deterministic and stochastic processes, while soil tillage determined the homogenizing dispersal dominated rhizobacterial community assembly for both MW and SW, due mainly to its significant effects on the soil moisture, total nitrogen, pH, and community diversity. Collectively, these findings provide a theoretical overview of agronomic practice-driven alteration of the rhizobacterial communities, and are expected to provide support for microbiome manipulation and adaptive management toward a more sustainable agriculture under dryland conditions.

Studying the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of land use change and habitat quality under multiple scenarios is significant for regional ecological restoration and management, and for preventing future ecological and environmental risks. We used the improved Logistic-CA-Markov (Logistic-Cellular Automata-Markov) and InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs) models to establish the spatial patterns of habitat quality in the Yellow River Basin from 2000 to 2040 and analyzed the characteristics of land use and habitat quality changes under scenarios of natural development (S1), ecological protection (S2), and urban expansion (S3). The results showed that in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020, the main land use types in the watershed were dryland and grassland, accounting for more than 72%. Paddy land, dryland, woodland, middle-coverage grassland, and unused land all showed decreasing trends, whereas all other land types showed increasing trends. Influenced by human activities and the environment, the watershed habitat quality was low, with 80% of the areas with middle to low grades, but the overall trend was rising. The spatial variability in habitat quality of the watershed was significant, with habitat quality improvements in the central and northern regions and continued deterioration around the cities in the southern and western parts. The spatial autocorrelation and aggregation of habitat quality in the watershed were strong, and future land use patterns in the study area had a significant relationship with human activities. Simulation of future scenarios revealed ecological conservation catalytic effects on habitat quality in the study area, whereas urban expansion deteriorated watershed habitat quality. This study could provide support for future ecological conservation decisions.																				2073-4441				NOV	2022	14	22							3767	10.3390/w14223767	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14223767													WOS:000887768500001

Conservation Systems for Positive Net Ecosystem Carbon Balance in Semiarid Drylands	AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES & ENVIRONMENT												Core IdeasThe soil organic C dynamics and net ecosystem C balance of five dryland cropping systems were compared.Conservation systems stored up to 15% more soil organic C than conventional system.Net ecosystem C balance was positive with cover cropping.Cover crops and conservation tillage are crucial for soil C storage in drylands. Biomass C inputs often limit agroecosystem C dynamics, nutrient cycling, and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in semiarid drylands. This study evaluated SOC and net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) of five cropping systems in the drylands of the Southern Great Plains. Cropping systems evaluated included corn (Zea mays)-sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] rotation with conventional tillage without cover cropping (CTNC), strip tillage with and without cover cropping (STCC and STNC, respectively), and no tillage with and without cover cropping (NTCC and NTNC, respectively). After 4 yr of experimental tillage, we measured CO2 emissions, soil and soil surface air temperatures, soil moisture content, potentially mineralizable carbon (PMC), total SOC, total nitrogen (TN), and net primary productivity (NPP). Conservation systems (any treatments including no-till, strip till, or cover crops) had 5 to 6 degrees C lower soil temperature and 2.8 to 4.9 degrees C lower soil surface air temperature and stored 2.3 to 3.9% more soil moisture content than CTNC. Conservation systems also stored 15.2% more SOC than CTNC. Cropping systems that integrated cover crops in the rotation (STCC and NTCC) had greater NPP and positive NECB. Regardless of tillage management, cover cropping had a greater NECB, including SOC (NECBSOC) than CTNC. Reducing tillage and diversifying cropping systems through cover cropping can benefit semiarid dryland agroecosystems by increasing SOC storage and maintaining positive NECB.

However, limited information is known about the characteristics of bidirectional trans-ports of nitrogen between sediment and overlying and pore water in different patterns of ditches undergoing seasonal freezing-thawing cycles. It is vital to better understand nitrogen interception and purification by ecological ditches. In order to clarify the interception of ecological ditches on internal and external nitrogen, overlying water and sediment samples of two typical agricultural ditches were collected and analyzed in Sanjiang Plain during the growing seasons of 2015-2017. The results indicated that the N-NO3- in overlying water, which was higher than N-NH4+, was the dominant inorganic nitrogen, whilst, in the sediment, N-NH4+ was much higher than N-NO3-, which should be attributed to the soil's adsorption of N-NH4+. In contrast to the dryland ditch, the paddy ditch had a more significant amount of inorganic nitrogen both in overlying water and sediment, which means that the non-point source nitrogen pollution caused by paddy fields was more severe than that of drylands. Compared with dryland ditches, N-NH4+ in the sediment of pad ditches seemed to be much easier to migrate to a deeper layer, which may cause a greater risk of nitrogen pollution to groundwater. Both in the overlying water and the sediment of ditches, nitrogen content fluctuated during different periods, and inter-annual variation was noticeable, which results means that estimation or prediction of the non-point source pollution output needs to extend the monitoring period and increase sampling frequency to reduce the great uncertainty. The findings may provide a foundation for forecasting agricultural nitrogen pollution and guide best management practices (BMPs) of non-point source nitrogen pollution control in seasonally frozen areas.																				2073-4441				AUG	2023	15	15							2789	10.3390/w15152789	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15152789													WOS:001046885300001

Products derived from UAS imagery have much finer spatial resolutions than traditional satellite or aircraft imagery, allowing the spectral and structural heterogeneity of vegetation to be mapped and monitored with more detail, an advantage especially useful for challenging environments such as dryland savannas. This study uses UAS-captured imagery to assess the efficacy of UAS for monitoring structural characteristics of vegetation in a mixed savanna woodland. The main objective was to compare multiple approaches for extracting woody vegetation structure from UAS imagery and assess correlations between in situ field measurements and UAS estimates. We compare different sensor types to determine whether multispectral data improve estimates of vegetation structure at the expense of spatial resolution. Results indicate that leveraging multispectral reflectance information, particularly in the near-infrared portion of the spectrum, aids in crown delineation, areal estimates, and fractional cover of woody and non-woody vegetation within the study area. We also compare two image segmentation techniques for crown delineation and found that all techniques perform best in grassy savanna sites where trees and shrubs are easily distinguishable. Overall, a region-growing technique consistently exhibits highest levels of agreement with in situ height and crown area measurements, while a simple height threshold is best for determining fractional coverage of structural classes present. Findings from this work contribute to the advancement for applying high spatial resolution, UAS-derived methods in remote sensing analyses with specific consideration towards autonomous crown delineation and resource management initiatives in dryland systems. Lastly, data-informed analyses, as presented here, provide robust scientific evidence that contribute to informing environmental management decisions when considering the use of UAS technology in conservation and wildlife management across Africa.

J	Gao, X; Zhao, DS				Gao, Xuan; Zhao, Dongsheng			Impacts of climate change on vegetation phenology over the Great Lakes Region of Central Asia from 1982 to 2014	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Dryland ecosystems in the Great Lakes Region of Central Asia (GLRCA) are highly sensitive to climate change due to the climate of spring precipitation. Although shifts in vegetation phenology have been widely attributed to rising temperature, the effects of solar radiation and drought on phenology remain largely unknown. Understanding the mechanisms of vegetation phenology response to climatic factors is essential for assessing the impact of climate change on dryland ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal variations of vegetation phenology across the GLRCA using a long-term series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and then examined the response of vegetation phenology to climate change within different climate zones by combining with climate data (surface temperature, soil moisture, short-wave radiation, and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI)). The results suggested that the start of growing season (SGS) and the end of growing season (EGS) were significantly earlier regionally by -0.143 days/year and -0.363 days/year, respectively. Because of changes in SGS and EGS, length of growing season (LGS) across the GLRCA was shortened at a rate of -0.442 days/yr, which was mainly attributed to advanced EGS. Additionally, SGS of vegetation was negatively correlated with surface temperature but positively correlated with soil moisture and SPEI. These results indicated that surface temperature was a major determinant of advanced spring phenology, while increased soil moisture and mitigated drought would delay spring phenology. The response of autumn phenology to surface temperature and short-wave radiation varied across different climate zones. In arid climate zone, autumn phenology was obviously advanced with the increase of surface temperature and short-wave radiation. In cold climate zone, higher surface temperature and short-wave radiation postponed autumn phenology. Meanwhile, the thermal growing season did not accurately characterize the actual vegetation growing season because GLRCA phenology was different from most of Northern Hemisphere.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				NOV 1	2022	845								157227	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157227	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157227		JUL 2022						35809736					WOS:000831321900007

This species consists of two main lineages (TauL1 and TauL2) and one minor lineage (TauL3). Its morpho-physiological diversity is large, with adaptations to a wide ecological range. Identification of allelic diversity in Ae. tauschii is of utmost importance for efficient breeding and widening of the genetic base of wheat. This study aimed at identifying markers or genes associated with morpho-physiological traits in Ae. tauschii, and at understanding the difference in genetic diversity between the two main lineages. We performed genome-wide association studies of 11 morpho-physiological traits of 343 Ae. tauschii accessions representing the entire range of habitats using 34,829 DArTseq markers. We observed a wide range of morpho-physiological variation among all accessions. We identified 23 marker-trait associations (MTAs) in all accessions, 15 specific to TauL1 and eight specific to TauL2, suggesting independent evolution in each lineage. Some of the MTAs could be novel and have not been reported in bread wheat. The markers or genes identified in this study will help reveal the genes controlling the morpho-physiological traits in Ae. tauschii, and thus in bread wheat even if the plant morphology is different.

Equids engineer desert water availability	SCIENCE												Megafauna play important roles in the biosphere, yet little is known about how they shape dryland ecosystems. We report on an overlooked form of ecosystem engineering by donkeys and horses. In the deserts of North America, digging of <= 2-meter wells to groundwater by feral equids increased the density of water features, reduced distances between waters, and, at times, provided the only water present. Vertebrate richness and activity were higher at equid wells than at adjacent dry sites, and, by mimicking flood disturbance, equid wells became nurseries for riparian trees. Our results suggest that equids, even those that are introduced or feral, are able to buffer water availability, which may increase resilience to ongoing human-caused aridification.

Global drivers of methane oxidation and denitrifying gene distribution in drylands	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Microorganisms carrying pmoA and nosZ genes are major drivers of methane and nitrous oxide fluxes from soils. However, most studies on these organisms have been conducted in mesic ecosystems; therefore, little is known about the factors driving their distribution in drylands, the largest biome on Earth. We conducted a global survey to evaluate the role of climate- and soil-related variables as predictors of the richness, abundance and community structure of bacteria carrying pmoA and nosZ genes. Location Eighty dryland ecosystems distributed worldwide. Time period From February 2006 to December 2011. Major taxa studied Methanotrophic (carrying the pmoA gene) and denitrifiying (carrying the nosZ gene) bacteria. Methods We used data from a field survey and structural equation modelling to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of climatic (aridity, rainfall seasonality and mean annual temperature) and soil (organic carbon, pH and texture) variables on the total abundance, richness and community structure of microorganisms carrying pmoA and nosZ genes. Results Taxa related to Methylococcus capsulatus or Methylocapsa sp., often associated with mesic environments, were common in global drylands. The abundance and richness of methanotrophs were not associated with climate or soil properties. However, mean annual temperature, rainfall seasonality, organic C, pH and sand content were highly correlated with their community structure. Aridity and soil variables, such as sand content and pH, were correlated with the abundance, community structure and richness of the nosZ bacterial community. Main conclusions Our study provides new insights into the drivers of the abundance, richness and community structure of soil microorganisms carrying pmoA and nosZ genes in drylands worldwide. We highlight how ongoing climate change will alter the structure of soil microorganisms, which might affect the net CH4 exchange and will probably reduce the capacity of dryland soils to carry out the final step of denitrification, favouring net N2O emissions.

Simulating the response of a threatened amphibian to climate-induced reductions in breeding habitat	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												ContextAmphibians are declining worldwide due to disease, invasive species, and habitat loss. Climate change may exacerbate habitat loss by altering the availability or suitability of aquatic breeding habitat through changes in precipitation, temperature, and the biophysical factors they influence. Measuring biological vital rates and the environmental covariates that affect them are crucial to understanding amphibian responses to a changing climate. However, doing so can be difficult due to access constraints, funding limitations, and difficulty of measuring spatially structured populations at landscape scales. Simulation-based approaches may provide reliable approximations of amphibian responses to changing environmental conditions.ObjectivesIn this study, we constructed a spatially explicit individual based model to simulate the response of the Arizona treefrog (Hyla wrightorum), a species of conservation concern, to reductions in breeding habitat availability. The Arizona treefrog metapopulation in the Huachuca Mountains and Canelo Hills of Arizona is known to breed at fewer than 20 breeding ponds that may become unsuitable due to climate change-induced shifts in hydroperiod, increased rates of invasion by non-native predators, or filling by sedimentation.MethodsWe simulated Arizona treefrog response to bioclimatically realistic scenarios that included reduced breeding habitat availability, failed recruitment, and a combination of both. Simulations included variable landscape configuration through space and time that were informed by an empirical hydroperiod dataset.ResultsWe found that climate-driven reductions in breeding habitat alone resulted in mean population declines of nearly 65%, even when reductions targeted the ponds least likely to fill with water. However, scenarios with concurrent breeding habitat loss and recruitment failure or very high recruitment failure resulted in 79% and 83% population declines, respectively. Reduced breeding habitat also increased spatial synchrony of occupancy through time and among simulations, pointing to a potential transition from a metapopulation to multiple isolated populations.ConclusionsIn the face of anthropogenically driven climate change and continually emerging management challenges, individual-based models provide a useful, mechanistic tool to explore how a combination of biological and environmental factors may interact to influence the future of species of conservation concern. We found evidence of a potential transition to isolated populations that may lead to limited functional connectivity and an increased risk of regional extinction for this species of conservation concern. Sensitivity analyses suggest our model was robust to uncertainty in model parameters and point to the critical role of dispersal in maintaining demographic and landscape connectivity among spatiotemporally heterogeneous habitat. A spatially explicit approach also enabled identification of specific habitat patches that may be less sensitive to climate change as well as those that may require more intensive management to conserve key populations or preserve metapopulation dynamics.

Understanding and Exploiting Transpiration Response to Vapor Pressure Deficit for Water Limited Environments	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												More frequent droughts and an increased pressure on water resources, combined with social licence to operate, will inevitably decrease water resources available for fully irrigated cotton production. Therefore, the long-term future of the cotton industry will require more drought tolerant varieties that can perform well when grown in rainfed cropping regions often exposed to intermittent drought. A trait that limits transpiration (TRLim) under an increased vapour pressure deficit (VPD) may increase crop yield in drier atmospheric conditions and potentially conserve soil water to support crop growth later in the growing season. However, this trait has not been tested or identified in cotton production systems. This study tested the hypotheses that (1) genetic variability to the TRLim VPD trait exists amongst 10 genotypes in the Australian cotton breeding programme; (2) genotypes with a TRLim VPD trait use less water in high VPD environments and (3) variation in yield responses of cotton genotypes is linked with the VPD environment and water availability during the peak flowering period. This study combined glasshouse and field experiments to assess plant transpiration and crop yield responses of predominantly locally bred cotton genotypes to a range of atmospheric VPD under Australian climatic conditions. Results indicated that genetic variation to the limiting transpiration VPD trait exists within cotton genotypes in the Australian breeding programme, with five genotypes identified as expressing the TRLim VPD trait. A modelling study suggests that this trait may not necessarily result in overall reduced plant water use due to greater transpiration rates at lower VPD environments negating the water conservation in high VPD environments. However, our study showed that the yield response of cotton genotypes is linked with both VPD environment and water availability during the peak flowering period. Yield performance of the TRLim genotype was improved at some high VPD environments but is unlikely to out-perform a genotype with a lower yield potential. Improved understanding of integrated plant- and crop-level genotypic responses to the VPD environments will enhance germplasm development to benefit cotton production in both rainfed and semi-irrigated cotton systems, thereby meeting the agricultural challenges of the twenty-first Century.

However, this is associated with depletion of soil organic matter and decreased fallow efficiency. Intensifying cropping systems by planting cover crops has been touted as a means to stem soil organic matter loss and improve fallow efficiency. We investigated whether the manipulation of cover crop functional trait diversity and sowing proportions (utilizing Poaceae, Fabaceae, and Brassicaceae) could provide complementary functions that improve soil water and mineral N management during fallow. Grass-legume mixtures represented the best compromise between biomass production (> 4000 kg DM ha(-1)), N retention (142 kg N ha(-1)), N supply via biological N fixation (35 kg N ha(-1)) and maintained an additional 70 mm of water at the end of fallow period. Regardless of functional trait type, cover crops increased N retention but maintained similar soil mineral N content at the end of fallow period. However, soil water effects were functional trait-specific, and there were significant soil water deficits with brassica-dominated cover crops. Soil water accumulation post cover crop termination was significantly higher in cover crops compared with conventional fallows, but the overall fallow efficiency was higher in the conventional fallow. This study demonstrates that cover crops are not universally beneficial, and careful selection of cover crop functional traits in mixtures could enhance fallow soil water and N management in semi-arid sub-tropical drylands.

J	Schillinger, WF; Archer, DW				Schillinger, William F.; Archer, David W.			Winter Triticale: A Long-Term Cropping Systems Experiment in a Dry Mediterranean Climate	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack) is a cereal feed grain grown annually worldwide on 4.2 million ha. Washington is the leading state for rainfed (i.e., non-irrigated) triticale production in the USA. A 9-year dryland cropping systems project was conducted from 2011 to 2019 near Ritzville, WA to compare winter triticale (WT) with winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (WW) grown in (i) a 3-year rotation of WT-spring wheat (SW) -no-till summer fallow (NTF) (ii) a 3-year rotation of WW-SW-undercutter tillage summer fallow (UTF) and (iii) a 2-year WW-UTF rotation, We measured grain yield, grain yield components, straw production, soil water dynamics, and effect on the subsequent SW wheat crop (in the two 3-year rotations). Enterprise budgets were constructed to evaluate the production costs and profitability. Grain yields averaged over the years were 5816, 5087, and 4689 kg/ha for WT, 3-year WW, and 2-year WW, respectively (p < 0.001). Winter triticale used slightly less water than WW (p = 0.019). Contrary to numerous reports in the literature, WT never produced more straw dry biomass than WW. Winter wheat produced many more stems than WT (p < 0.001), but this was compensated by individual stem weight of WT being 60% heavier than that of WW (p < 0.001). Spring wheat yield averaged 2451 vs. 2322 kg/ha after WT and WW, respectively (p = 0.022). The market price for triticale grain was always lower than that for wheat. Winter triticale produced an average of 14 and 24% more grain than 3-year and 2-year WW, respectively, provided foliar fungal disease control, risk reduction, and other rotation benefits, but was not economically competitive with WW. A 15-21% increase in WT price or grain yield would be necessary for the WT rotation to be as profitable as the 3-year and 2-year WW rotations, respectively.

The aridity index (AI) is often defined as the ratio of annual precipitation to annual potential evapotranspiration. However, how the drying and wetting influence the vegetation response and its characteristic along aridity gradient remains unclear. Here, we examined trends of the AI and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the drylands of East Asia from 1982 to 2015, which denoted the drying and wetting trends and vegetation response, respectively. The results show that the variability in land area and AI from 1982-2015 was lower in the whole dryland than its subtypes including hyper-arid, arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid regions. Drying and wetting trends were observed in each AI interval along a spatial aridity gradient. Wetting trends are prevalent owing to their area and magnitude were twice those of drying trends. Spatial variation of aridity shaped the pattern of trends in vegetation response to drying and wetting trends; drier regions had smaller and narrower ranges of variation in NDVI trends relative to wetter regions. A shift in AI trends and NDVI trends along the spatial aridity gradient occurred at 0.4 of AI. Distinct patterns of vegetation response to aridity change were observed across the aridity threshold, and the transition region was identified in the studied drylands. The results suggest that changes in the subtypes might be masked by the entire drylands and then leading to failure in recognizing the transformation of the subtypes. This implies that terrestrial carbon storage variability prediction should consider the spatial aridity changes to avoid the uncertainties due to the divergent vegetation response to AI trends at different aridity levels.

Maximizing water use efficiency (WUE) in dryland farming systems remains a challenge. The objectives of this study were to assessing the robustness of radiation use efficiency (RUE) during different periods and investigate the interaction between RUE and WUE from water loss pattern and canopy development during wheat growth under different agricultural practices (non-mulched control, CK; transparent film mulching, TF; and black film mulching, BF) from 2013 to 2016 on the Loess Plateau, Northwest China. Results showed that RUE was mainly improved during postanthesis under PM treatments. PM treatments contributed to elevated canopy photosynthesis and a delayed RUE peak during the reproductive period. Due to the increased spike number and ratio of plant transpiration to soil evaporation, TF and BF treatments had relatively stable photosynthetic activity relative to the CK treatment even those during dry periods. Initially, no relationship was found between WUE and RUE under the CK treatment. On the other hand, RUE and WUE were positively related in TF and BF treatments following a power function. RUE values increased with WUE rapidly to stabilize at a plateau value of 5.5 g MJ(-1) under TF and BF treatments, and thus, the wheat WUE had a higher improvement potential than RUE as it did not have an apparent plateau value. PM treatments enhanced the wheat production by taking full advantage of local solar radiation and precipitation (improving RUE and WUE). This higher use efficiency of resources produced more photoassimilates for wheat than that under the CK management, increased source size (LAI) and sink size (spike number) during wheat growth seasons, and thus increased the final grain yield.

Effect of traditional check dams (<i>jessour</i>) on soil and olive trees water status in Tunisia	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In the arid regions of south eastern Tunisia, the land use is predominated by olive trees cropping, where two main cultivation strategies can be found: using of water harvesting techniques to overcome the scarcity and variability of rainfall (in the Matmatta mountains) and dryland farming (in the Jeffara plain). In these arid areas, soil moisture is the main limiting factor for crop growth and it should be monitored to benchmark different management options. Different conventional methods are available for point soil moisture monitoring, but the increased availability of remotely sensed data offers major opportunities for spatial analyses. The aim of this paper is to perform a comparative study on the soil water status for rainfed olive tree growing in three major landscape areas: in the mountains with traditional water harvesting check dams (called jessour), in the piedmont on floodwater harvesting (called tabias), and in the plain with full dryland farming conditions. Time series of Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII), derived from Landsat 7 satellite, were retrieved from the novel Google Earth Engine platform. NDII values were related to measured soil water content, which was taken at non-regular time intervals between 2009 and 2017. The analysis of NDII data, indicating the water content of the vegetation, shows that jessour can adequately ensure water supply for olive trees. Increased soil moisture conditions in the jessour areas are visible both in the dry and the humid seasons, indicating the effectiveness of this traditional water harvesting system. Moreover, our results show that Landsat 7 NDII values are correlated with the root-zone soil moisture in the monitoring sites (r(2) ranging from 0.62 to 0.67), allowing the use of NDII to estimate soil water contents in our study area.

J	Wang, XJ; Wang, L; Wang, TL				Wang, Xiaojuan; Wang, Lei; Wang, Tianle			Effect of Replacing Mineral Fertilizer with Manure on Soil Water Retention Capacity in a Semi-Arid Region	AGRONOMY-BASEL												The long-term and excessive use of mineral fertilizers in a semi-arid region with severe water shortage will lead to soil compaction and poor water-holding capacity. The fertilization method of manure instead of mineral fertilizer has attracted wide attention. It has adverse consequences for the growth and development of crops. Hence, the objective of this study was to determine how replacing mineral fertilizer with manure affects the soil water retention curve, soil water constant, soil water availability, and soil equivalent pore size distribution, and to seek the best scheme of applying manure in semi-arid area and provide theoretical a basis for improving soil water retention capacity. Here, 0% (CK), 25% (M25), 50% (M50), 75% (M75), and 100% (M100) of 225 kg ha-1 nitrogen from mineral fertilizer were replaced with equivalent nitrogen from manure in the Loess Plateau of China under semi-arid conditions. The centrifuge method was used to determine the soil volumetric water content under different water suction levels, and the Gardner model was used to fit and draw its soil water retention curve, and then calculate the soil water constant and equivalent pore size distribution. The results showed that the Gardner model fitted well. The soil saturated water content with the M100 treatment was the highest, whereas the specific water capacity, water availability, and soil porosity with the M75 treatment were the highest. The soil saturated water content showed a downward trend with the increase in nitrogen from manure instead of nitrogen from mineral fertilizer in the partial replacement treatments. This downward trend slowed down over time. The M75 treatment increased field capacity. The M100 treatment increased soil capillary porosity, soil available water porosity, and soil water availability compared with CK from the fifth fertilization. Replacement treatments increased the specific water capacity, soil saturated water content, soil water availability, soil porosity, and reduced the wilting point over time. In the replacement treatments, specific soil water capacity, soil water availability, and soil porosity first rose and then declined with the increase in nitrogen provided by manure replacing that provided by mineral fertilizer. Therefore, the soil water holding capacity and water supply capacity with the M75 treatment were the best.																				2073-4395				SEP	2023	13	9							2272	10.3390/agronomy13092272	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13092272													WOS:001073247200001
J	Zha, XJ; Niu, B; Li, M; Duan, C				Zha, Xinjie; Niu, Ben; Li, Meng; Duan, Cheng			Increasing Impact of Precipitation on Alpine-Grassland Productivity over Last Two Decades on the Tibetan Plateau	REMOTE SENSING												Understanding the importance of temperature and precipitation on plant productivity is beneficial, to reveal the potential impact of climate change on vegetation growth. Although some studies have quantified the response of vegetation productivity to climate change at local, regional, and global scales, changes in climatic constraints on vegetation productivity over time are not well understood. This study combines the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the net primary production (NPP) modeled by CASA during the plant-growing season, to quantify the interplay of climatic (growing-season temperature and precipitation, GST and GSP) constraints on alpine-grassland productivity on the Tibetan Plateau, as well as the temporal dynamics of these constraints. The results showed that (1) 42.2% and 36.3% of grassland NDVI and NPP on the Tibetan Plateau increased significantly from 2000 to 2019. GSP controlled grassland growth in dryland regions, while humid grasslands were controlled by the GST. (2) The response strength of the NDVI and NPP to precipitation (partial correlation coefficient RNDVI-GSP and RNPP-GSP) increased substantially between 2000 and 2019. Especially, the RNDVI-GSP and RNPP-GSP increased from 0.14 and 0.01 in the first 10year period (2000-2009) to 0.83 and 0.78 in the second 10-year period (2010-2019), respectively. As a result, the controlling factor for alpine-grassland productivity variations shifted from temperature during 2000-2009 to precipitation during 2010-2019. (3) The increase in precipitation constraints was mainly distributed in dryland regions of the plateau. This study highlights that the climatic constraints on alpine-grassland productivity might change under ongoing climate change, which helps the understanding of the ecological responses and helps predict how vegetation productivity changes in the future.

Related initiatives are particularly contested when it comes to a tree-based form of bioenergy that is used in large quantities all around the world and that ranks among the most commercialised but least regulated commodities in sub-Saharan Africa, namely charcoal. Throughout the region charcoal is used for residential cooking and heating by millions of households. While consumers are mainly located in urban and peri-urban settings, the growing demand for charcoal is largely met by rural dryland populations whose production-end practices have long been considered a major cause of deforestation and land degradation. Recent charcoal policies aim to create and support sustainable production pathways, especially through the provisioning of appropriate technologies (for instance, more efficient kilns) and improved managerial mechanisms (such as standardised environmental assessments). In order to make local forms of knowledge and practice more relevant to ongoing scholarly and political discussions on the charcoal sector, this paper proposes the notion of fuelscape as a conceptual space where the environmental and livelihood impacts of charcoal production can be revealed, compared and debated. This proposition is developed in three parts. In the first part, we introduce fuelscapes as a critical tool through which to approach (dryland) energy landscapes. In the second part, we explore how local stakeholders in Central Pokot, Kenya, account for the shifting significance and contested meaning of commercialised charcoal production in temporal, material and social terms. The discussion then captures contested fuelscapes more broadly and with reference to three interrelated themes; namely historicity, complexity and diversity. We conclude by suggesting key areas of strategic lesson-drawing for future charcoal research and policy in sub-Saharan drylands.

This irrigation method relies on conventional weirs to divert the river's flow. This study was carried out in three northern region provinces of Zambia between November 2022 and January 2023 to conduct a functional diagnostic assessment of simple weirs during the dry and rainy seasons. In this study, 15 simple weirs were chosen for investigation. The goal of this study was to determine their physical status, identify their problems and scope, and evaluate simple weirs' potential for river water diversion. According to this study, 26% of the weirs had broken sections and 67% were in excellent condition (being recently maintained and restored). Despite the challenges mentioned earlier, farmers have continued to construct them because they cannot afford to purchase stone or concrete irrigation structures due to the location and/or small-scale area available for irrigation development. Simple weirs may act as a beneficial supplement to irrigation technologies. The use of local building materials and the use of traditional skills is encouraged by this technology.																				2073-4441				NOV	2023	15	22							3935	10.3390/w15223935	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15223935													WOS:001113758500001

Effects of climate change and adaptation options on winter wheat yield under rainfed Mediterranean conditions in southern Portugal	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Projected warming and drying trends over the Mediterranean region represent a substantial threat for wheat production. The present study assesses winter wheat yield response to potential climate change and estimates the quantitative effectiveness of using early flowering cultivars and early sowing dates as adaptation options for the major wheat production region of Portugal. A crop model (STICS) is used for this purpose, which is calibrated for yield simulations before projecting future yields. Climate projections over 2021-2050 and 2051-2080 under two emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) are retrieved from bias-adjusted datasets, generated by a ten-member climate model ensemble. Projected intensification of water deficits and more frequent high-temperature events during late spring (April-June), coinciding with the sensitive grain filling stage, primarily result in continuous mean yield losses (relative to 1981-2010) by -14% (both scenarios) during 2021-2050 and by -17% (RCP4.5) or -27% (RCP8.5) during 2051-2080, also accompanied by increased yield variabilities. Of evaluated adaptation options at various levels, using earlier flowering cultivars reveals higher yield gains (26-38%) than that of early sowings (6-10%), which are able to reverse the yield reductions. The adopted early flowering cultivars successfully advance the anthesis onset and grain filling period, which reduces or avoids the risks of exposure to enhanced drought and heat stresses in late spring. In contrast, winter warming during early sowing window could affect vernalization fulfillment by slowing effective chilling accumulation, thus increasing the pre-anthesis growth length with limited effects on advancing reproductive stage. Crop yield projections and explored adaptation options are essential to assess food security prospects (availability and stability) of dry Mediterranean areas, providing crucial insights for appropriate policymaking.

J	Stafford-Smith, M; Metternicht, G				Stafford-Smith, Mark; Metternicht, Graciela			Governing drylands as global environmental commons	CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY												Recent years have seen growing calls to govern land resources as global environmental commons, delivering benefits to all of humanity in support of the Sustainable Development Goals. Applying this call to drylands ? almost half of the world?s land ? allows responses that are better tailored to dryland attributes. Four key elements for global drylands governance emerge from linking an understanding of drylands attributes with recent global governance scholarship: the need for a polycentric system with nested goal setting, transparent monitoring and graduated sanctions. These elements require nuanced application in drylands, with an emphasis on empowering the local. We describe how the present global governance architecture for drylands ? the UN Convention to Combat Desertification ? provides a partial scaffolding, but falls short in specific areas that deserve attention.

Here we propose and test a new approach to produce 3D characterizations of crop water use and root activity in large field genotype (G) by environment (E) by management (M) experi-mentation, using electromagnetic induction (EMI) instrument coupled with a quasi-2D inversion algorithm, and crop canopy sensing technologies. A root activity factor (R) was calculated as a function of crop water use, soil water availability, and an indicator of crop demand. We ask i) can this approach provide accurate 3D charac-terizations of sorghum water use and root activity?, and (ii) does the approach capture complex GxExM dy-namics?. This study was conducted based on an on-farm field experiment consisting of the factorial combination of six commercial sorghum genotypes (G), three times of sowing, two levels of irrigation (E), four plant densities (M), and three replications. Two EMI surveys ten days apart were collected using a DUALEM-21S sensor. An artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed to predict 3D soil moisture (theta v) using depth-specific true soil electrical conductivity (sigma, mS m-1) estimated by the inversion algorithm. Crop water use between surveys was described as the difference of theta v. A multispectral index derived from satellite imagery was used as a proxy for crop demand i.e., size of the crop canopy. Principal components analysis, linear mixed models, and recursive partitioning tree techniques and crop-eco-physiological principles were used to untangle complex GxExM in-teractions. Results indicate that 3D crop water use could be predicted with high accuracy (LCCC = 0.81) and low prediction error (RMSE = 0.03 cm3 cm-3). The calculated water use and the value of R were significantly affected by depth, crop growth stage, irrigation treatment, plant density, and their interactions. At flowering, roots were most active at 0-1.3 m under irrigation, and deeper (0.5-1.5 m) under dryland treatment. The highest water use was for three genotypes (i.e., C, E and F) grown under irrigation and high plant densities (i.e., 9 and 12 pl m-2). The smallest water use was observed under dryland treatment, particularly for two genotypes (i.e., B and C) and high plant densities. For the crops at vegetative stages, the values of water use and R were highest in the top 0.5 m of soil depth. Larger water use was observed under dryland treatment and high plant densities, while the effects of genotypes were small (not significant). We conclude that the approach provides a rapid, accurate and cost-efficient option to phenotype crop root activity i.e., water use, in large field experimentation. We also argue that the improved understanding of the crop water use dynamics can help inform optimum combinations of genotypes and management options i.e., crop designs, across contrasting environments, and help untangle complex GxExM interactions.

Droughting a megadrought: Ecological consequences of a decade of experimental drought atop aridification on the Colorado Plateau	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Global dryland vegetation communities will likely change as ongoing drought conditions shift regional climates towards a more arid future. Additional aridification of drylands can impact plant and ground cover, biogeochemical cycles, and plant-soil feedbacks, yet how and when these crucial ecosystem components will respond to drought intensification requires further investigation. Using a long-term precipitation reduction experiment (35% reduction) conducted across the Colorado Plateau and spanning 10 years into a 20+ year regional megadrought, we explored how vegetation cover, soil conditions, and growing season nitrogen (N) availability are impacted by drying climate conditions. We observed large declines for all dominant plant functional types (C-3 and C-4 grasses and C-3 and C-4 shrubs) across measurement period, both in the drought treatment and control plots, likely due to ongoing regional megadrought conditions. In experimental drought plots, we observed less plant cover, less biological soil crust cover, warmer and drier soil conditions, and more soil resin-extractable N compared to the control plots. Observed increases in soil N availability were best explained by a negative correlation with plant cover regardless of treatment, suggesting that declines in vegetation N uptake may be driving increases in available soil N. However, in ecosystems experiencing long-term aridification, increased N availability may ultimately result in N losses if soil moisture is consistently too dry to support plant and microbial N immobilization and ecosystem recovery. These results show dramatic, worrisome declines in plant cover with long-term drought. Additionally, this study highlights that more plant cover losses are possible with further drought intensification and underscore that, in addition to large drought effects on aboveground communities, drying trends drive significant changes to critical soil resources such as N availability, all of which could have long-term ecosystem impacts for drylands.

However, the lack of soil nutrient availability due to the immobilization with straw mulch decomposition would result in a decrease in crop yield and harvest index. Based on a 9-yr straw mulching field experiment, we evaluated the effect of late topdressing in 2 yr on crop yield under a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) monoculture system in the Loess Plateau of China. Three treatments were included as straw mulching at rates of 9,000 (HSM) and 4,500 kg ha(-1) (LSM) during growing season and control without mulching (CK) from 2008 to 2019. Topdressing as urea was added to each plot at wheat tillering from 2017 to 2019. Across 2 yr, strawmulching significantly increased soilwater storage at most growing stages. Compared with CK, straw mulching promoted wheat growth (tiller density and plant density) but decreased grain yield and harvest index significantly. SoilmineralNcontents in later wheat-growing stages and net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate of wheat flag leaf and leaf water use efficiency during filling stage decreased with HSM and LSM when compared with CK. However, late topdressing significantly increased wheat grain yield in both years. Generally, additional application of N fertilizer in the late growing stage could alleviate the yield decrease by straw mulching and should be considered for sustainable crop production in the Loess Plateau of China.

J	Gao, XY; Tao, ZX; Dai, JH				Gao, Xinyue; Tao, Zexing; Dai, Junhu			Significant influences of extreme climate on autumn phenology in Central Asia grassland	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Over the past half-century, there has been a significant rise in the frequency and intensity of extreme climate events in dryland ecosystems. While vegetation phenology acts as an important indicator of how ecosystems respond to climate change, the impact of extreme climate events on autumn phenology in dryland ecosystems remains uncertain. In this study, we firstly assessed the temporal variations in the end of growing season (EOS) in Central Asia using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and enhanced vegetation index over 2001-2018. Then, we assessed the impacts of eight climate indices, which capture the average and extreme conditions of the local climate, on EOS across diverse vegetation types using linear mixed models. Finally, we conducted partial correlation analysis to explore how the primary influencing factors affect EOS along an elevational gradient. Our results suggested increased occurrences of drought and heat events in the pre-growing season (April-September) in Central Asia. Under the background, a general trend towards earlier EOS (ca. 1.01 days/decade) was observed for grassland. This trend was mostly attributed to the changes in extreme climate indices (CIextreme), especially heavy rainfall and heat stress. The total explanatory power of CIextreme was almost twice that of mean climate indices (CImean). However, the impact of CIextreme was less pronounced in regions with elevations exceeding 1500 m. For forests and shrublands, the EOS exhibited delaying trend of 1.29 days/decade and advancing trend of 1.21 days/decade, respectively. Contrary to grasslands, the variations in EOS of forests and shrublands were largely influenced by the shift of CImean, especially mean minimum temperature and accumulated precipitation. The contribution of CIextreme accounted for only 1/6 of the contribution of CImean, likely attributed to the adaptation of forests to cold conditions and shrublands to arid conditions. The results provide valuable insights into the phenological response to extreme climate events and serve as a reference for ecosystem management in arid regions.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				NOV	2023	155								111056	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111056	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111056		OCT 2023											WOS:001091734400001
J	Lavoie, AL; Dentzman, K; Wardropper, CB				Lavoie, Avery Lynn; Dentzman, Katherine; Wardropper, Chloe Bradley			Using diffusion of innovations theory to understand agricultural producer perspectives on cover cropping in the inland Pacific Northwest, USA	RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS												There is increased interest in cover crops on farms; those planted during the fallow period or in place of a cash crop to improve soil and water quality. Despite extensive research suggesting that the practice can enhance on-farm resilience, cover crop use is not widespread, especially across the dryland wheat-growing region of the USA inland Pacific Northwest. Cover crops are being promoted across this region as a means to improve agronomic conditions and farmer livelihoods. Yet, there is limited producer-centered social science research to understand the regional and field-level challenges associated with the practice. To address this gap, we draw from the diffusion of innovations theory to examine the perceived relative advantage (the degree to which cover crops are compatible with the current agricultural system), and trialability of cover crops. Trialability encompasses the relative complexity and observability of the practice. Interviews (n = 28) were conducted with producers to better understand perceptions on relative advantage and how cover crop characteristics may contribute to barriers to adoption. Based on the results from interviews, focus groups (n = 48) were conducted to explore potential avenues for improving the integration of cover crops into existing cropping systems. Analysis of interviews with dryland crop and livestock producers suggested that perceptions of low relative advantage, including low compatibility with common regional management systems, perceived tack of profitability and increased cost of inputs act as deterrents to cover crop integration. Low trialability was associated with the complexity of experimentation, a lack of directly observable results and inflexible regional policies. These perceptions were compounded by a lack of region-specific agronomic and economic information on cover crops. Analysis of focus groups with crop and livestock producers and agricultural stakeholders suggested that there are several opportunities to improve potential adoption strategies and improve perceptions of relative advantage and trialability. Understanding the unique management goals of producers within the environmental, social and economic context in which they operate will better inform regional policies, outreach and future adoption strategies.

J	Potts, DL; Barron-Gafford, GA; Scott, RL				Potts, Daniel L.; Barron-Gafford, Greg A.; Scott, Russell L.			Ecosystem hydrologic and metabolic flashiness are shaped by plant community traits and precipitation	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Understanding the hydrologic and carbon cycling consequences of precipitation variability in dryland ecosystems requires improved appreciation and accounting of how above- and belowground biophysical processes differ in their response to rainfall. Our objective was to contrast the sensitivity of dryland ecosystem evapotranspiration (ET), gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), and ecosystem respiration (R-e) in response to inter- and intra-annual precipitation variability in a nearby grassland, savanna, and shrubland ecosystems in southeastern Arizona. To do this, we modified the Richards-Baker index, which quantifies the flashiness of a stream's hydrograph, to calculate analogous indices of ecosystem hydrologic and metabolic flashiness. In this way, ecosystem flashiness describes the frequency and rapidity of short-term fluctuations in H2O and CO2 exchange in response to precipitation while preserving the sequence of day-to-day variation in fluxes using tower-based time-series of daily averaged ET, GEP and R-e. We calculated annual hydrologic, GEP, and R-e flashiness (f(ET), f(GEP) and f(Re) respectively) using 6 years of daily-averaged fluxes estimated from eddy covariance. In contrast to our prediction, annual f(GEP) was consistently greater than annual f(Re). Furthermore, we predicted that increasing rooting depth would correlate with a decline in annual f(ET) and f(GEP). In fact, annual f(GEP) was similar between the grassland, savanna, and shrubland. Whereas the response of annual f(ET) and f(GEP) to annual precipitation was plant community dependent and generally declined with increasing rainfall, annual f(Re) did not vary in response to precipitation. The effect of late summer storms on f(GEP) was plant community dependent such that shrubland f(GEP) and f(Re) strongly declined in response to rainfall whereas grassland and savanna f(GEP) was relatively unresponsive. Conceptually similar to hydrologic flashiness, ecosystem flashiness may provide an additional lens through which to observe the influence of resource availability, shifts in community composition, and disturbance on ecosystem hydrologic and carbon cycling.																			0168-1923	1873-2240				DEC 15	2019	279								107674	10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.107674	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.107674													WOS:000500197400004

Precise utilization of diverse genetic resources is fundamental in breeding programs to improve high yield genotypes with desirable traits. In this study, for the first time we report successful application of DArTseq technology; an efficient genotyping-by-sequencing (NGS); to analysis genetic diversity and population structure of 89 safflower accessions from worldwide origins. Totally, 19,639 DArTseq markers (10,130 SilicoDArTs and 9509 SNPs) generated through DArTseq genotyping. After filtering the data, 3431 polymorphic DArTseq markers (1136 SilicoDArTs and 2295 SNPs) used for genetic diversity, population structure and linkage disequilibrium analysis in safflower genotypes. All the SilicoDArT and SNP markers showed high reproducibility and call rate. Polymorphism information content (PIC) values ranged from 0.1 to 0.5, while >= 0.50% of SilicoDArTs and >= 0.64% SNPs showed PIC values more than median. Genotypes grouping using DArTseq markers resulted in three distinct clusters. Results showed weak correlation between safflower diversity pattern and origins. Analysis of molecular variance revealed that the majority of genetic variation was attributed to the differences among varieties within cluster populations and there was no significant molecular variance between origins. However, safflower of accessions belonged to Iran, Turkey, Pakistan and India indeed appear to be genetically similar and grouped close in referred cluster, while the accessions from Near East (Afghanistan, China) being distinct. Our results were in agreement with hypothesis that safflower domesticated in somewhere west of Fertile Crescent and then expanded through Africa and Europe. Present study using a panel of globally diverse safflower accessions and large number of DArTseq markers set the stage for future analysis of safflower domestication using large germplasm from proposed domestication centers. Also, studied germplasm in this study can be used as a valuable source for future genomic studies in safflower for mapping desirable traits through genome-wide association mapping studies.

Weed shift and community diversity in conservation and conventional agriculture systems in pigeonpea- castor systems under rainfed semi-arid tropics	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Conservation agriculture (CA) is an alternative sustainable production system to conventional tillage system for resource conservation in rainfed agriculture. Weeds are the major constraints for adoption of CA in rainfed regions. A seven years study was done at ICAR- Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Hyderabad, India, to study the effects of different tillage practices and residue levels on weed shift, diversity and crop yields. It was observed that annual weed species were dominant in conventional tillage (CT) and reduced tillage (RT), whereas a shift towards perennials was observed in zero tillage (ZT). The CT recorded significantly lower weed density and weed biomass (12.89 m- 2 and 35.60 g m-2) over RT (17.33 m- 2 and 38.37 g m-2) and ZT (36.67 m- 2 and 69.58 g m-2) after seven years, respectively. A shift in weed species, higher weed density and weed biomass in dicots (Tridax procumbens L and Euphorbia hirta L. and a marginal decrease in monocots (Bulbostylis barbata, Digitaria sanguinalis L) was observed in ZT. The marginal decrease in monocots was due to higher precipitation immediately after herbicide application which reduced the control of weeds due to leaching. The anchored residues 10 and 30 cm recorded lower monocots and total weed count over No residue. The study suggests that integrated weed management (combination of herbicide and removal of chance weeds) and in RT are efficient strategies to minimise the weed infestation in CA and these methods not only reduce the over reliance on herbicides but also improve the productivity of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L.), castor (Ricinus communis) and the environmental performance of CA. ZT and RT recorded the highest Shannon index, Pielous evenness index and species richness over CT which indicates a higher weed species diversity in ZT as compared to CT. This study helps to improve the understanding of crop-weed communities and in the development of cost effective environmentally sound weed management strategies.
